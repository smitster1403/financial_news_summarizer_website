Asian shares track rally on Wall Street that won back most of Friday's wipeout,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/asian-shares-track-rally-on-wall-street-that-won-back-most-of-fridays-wipeout-2025-08-05/,"BANGKOK (AP) — Asian shares advanced on Tuesday, following U.S. stocks higher after they won back most of their sharp loss from last week. Investors appeared to have recovered some confidence after worries over how President Donald Trump’s tariffs may be punishing the economy sent a shudder through Wall Street last week. At the same time, a stunningly weak U.S. jobs report Friday raised expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its next meeting in September, potentially a plus for markets. This week's highlights will likely include earnings reports from The Walt Disney Co., McDonald’s and Caterpillar, along with updates on U.S. business activity. In Asian trading, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index gained 0.6% to 40,515.81, while the Kospi in South Korea jumped 1.4% to 3,192.57. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng rose 0.3% to 24,799.67. The Shanghai Composite index was up 0.5% at 3,602.13. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 jumped 1.1% to 8,759.90, while the SET in Thailand also gained 1.1%. India's Sensex was the sole outlier, losing 0.5% on concerns over trade tensions with the United States, with the Trump administration insisting on cutbacks in oil purchases from Russia. India has indicated that it will continue buying oil from Russia, saying its relationship with Moscow was ‘steady and time-tested,’ and that its stance on securing its energy needs is guided by the availability of oil in the markets and prevailing global circumstances. “Trump’s threats of ‘substantial’ tariff hikes on account of imports of Russian crude pose a quagmire for India,” Mizuho Bank said in a commentary. “Between exacerbated U.S.-imposed geo-economic headwinds and financial/macro setbacks from Russian oil advantages lost, pain will be hard to avert.” On Monday, the S&P 500 jumped 1.5% to 6,329.94. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.3%, or 585.06 points, to 44,173.64. The Nasdaq composite leaped 2% to 21,053.58. Idexx Laboratories helped Wall Street recover from its worst day since May, soaring 27.5% after the seller of veterinary instruments and other health care products reported a stronger profit for the spring than analysts expected. The pressure is on U.S. companies to deliver bigger profits after their stock prices shot to record after record recently. Reports from big U.S. companies have largely come in better than expected and could help steady a U.S. stock market that may have been due for some turbulence. A jump in stock prices from a low point in April had raised criticism that the broad market had become too expensive. Tyson Foods likewise delivered a bigger-than-expected profit for the latest quarter, and the company behind the Jimmy Dean and Hillshire Farms brands rose 2.4%. They helped make up for a nearly 3% loss for Berkshire Hathaway after Warren Buffett’s company reported a drop in profit for its latest quarter from a year earlier. The drop-off was due in part to the falling value of its investment in Kraft Heinz. American Eagle Outfitters jumped 23.6% after Trump weighed in on the debate surrounding the retailer’s advertisements, which highlight actor Sydney Sweeney’s great jeans. Some critics thought the reference to the blonde-haired and blue-eyed actor’s “great genes” may be extolling a narrow set of beauty standards. “Go get ’em Sydney!” Trump said on his social media network. Wayfair climbed 12.7% after the retailer of furniture and home decor said accelerating growth helped it make more in profit and revenue during the spring than analysts expected. Tesla rose 2.2% after awarding CEO Elon Musk 96 million shares of restricted stock valued at approximately $29 billion. The move could alleviate worries that Musk may leave the company. In other dealings early Tuesday, U.S. benchmark crude oil shed 9 cents to $66.20 per barrel while Brent crude, the international standard, gave up 8 cents to $68.68 per barrel. The U.S. dollar was unchanged at 147.09 Japanese yen. The euro slipped to $1.1555 from $1.1573. ___ AP Business Writers Stan Choe and Matt Ott contributed.

Trump pressures China and India to stop buying cheap Russian oil,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-pressures-china-and-india-to-stop-buying-cheap-russian-oil-2025-08-04/,"U.S. President Donald Trump is pushing China and India to stop buying oil from Russia and helping fund the Kremlin’s war against Ukraine. Trump is raising the issue as he seeks to press Russian President Vladimir Putin to agree to a ceasefire. But cheap Russian oil benefits refiners in those countries as well as meeting their needs for energy, and they’re not showing any inclination to halt the practice. China, India and Turkey are the biggest recipients of oil that used to go to the European Union. The EU’s decision to boycott most Russian seaborne oil from January 2023 led to a massive shift in crude flows from Europe to Asia. Since then China has been the No. 1 overall purchaser of Russian energy since the EU boycott, with some $219.5 billion worth of Russian oil, gas and coal, followed by India with $133.4 billion and Turkey with $90.3 billion. Before the invasion, India imported relatively little Russian oil. Hungary imports some Russian oil through a pipeline. Hungary is an EU member, but President Viktor Orban has been critical of sanctions against Russia. One big reason: It's cheap. Since Russian oil trades at a lower price than international benchmark Brent, refineries can fatten their profit margins when they turn crude into usable products such as diesel fuel. The Kyiv School of Economics says Russia took in $12.6 billion from oil sales in June. Russia continues to earn substantial sums even as the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations has tried to limit Russia's take by imposing an oil price cap. The cap is to be enforced by requiring shipping and insurance companies to refuse to handle oil shipments above the cap. Russia has to a great extent been able to evade the cap by shipping oil on a “shadow fleet” of old vessels using insurers and trading companies located in countries that are not enforcing sanctions. Russian oil exporters are predicted to take in $153 billion this year, according to the Kyiv institute. Fossil fuels are the single largest source of budget revenue. The imports support Russia's ruble currency and help Russia to buy goods from other countries, including weapons and parts for them. Before you consider Fossil Group, you'll want to hear this."
Australia selects Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries for $6.5B warship deal,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/australia-selects-japans-mitsubishi-heavy-industries-for-65b-warship-deal-2025-08-04/,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Australia said Tuesday it accepted a Japanese company's bid for a lucrative and hotly contested contract to build Australian warships, expected to be worth 10 billion Australian dollars ($6.5 billion). Mitsubishi Heavy Industries’ Mogami-class frigate won the deal over rival Germany’s MEKO A-200 from Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems. Japan’s government lobbied heavily for the deal after missing out on Australia’s submarines contract to a French company in 2016. “This is clearly the biggest defense industry agreement that will ever have been struck between Japan and Australia,” Defense Minister Richard Marles told reporters when he announced the deal Tuesday. “In fact, it’s really one of the biggest defense exports that Japan has ever engaged in.” The fleet of 11 naval vessels will replace Australia’s ageing fleet of ANZAC-class ships. Three of the frigates will be built in Japan, with the first scheduled to be operational Australia in 2030, and the remaining eight due for construction in Australia. Australian news outlets reported that the German company’s bid had emphasized their vessel’s cheaper price and their greater experience building ships abroad. But Pat Conroy, Australia’s Minister for Defense Industry, said the Mogami-class frigate was a “clear winner” when assessed by “cost, capability and meeting our schedule of delivery.” The vessels have a range of up to 10,000 nautical miles (18,520 kilometers) and 32 vertical launch cells capable of launching long-range missiles. The frigates can operate with a crew of 90, compared to the 170 needed to operate the ANZAC-class ships. Mitsubishi’s win was a boon for Japan’s defense industry, which has not built naval vessels abroad before. Japan, whose only treaty ally is the United States, considers Australia a semi-ally and has increasingly sought to deepen bilateral military cooperation amid ongoing regional tensions in the disputed South China Sea. “We welcome the decision by the Australian government as a major step to further elevate Japan’s national security cooperation with Australia, which is our special strategic partner,” Japan’s Defense Minister Gen Nakatani said Tuesday. Nakatani said co-developing the frigate will allow the two countries to train and operate with the same equipment and further improve operability and efficiency. Japan set up a joint taskforce of government and industry in an effort to win the bid. Australian officials said work on a binding commercial contract with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and the government of Japan would now begin, with a finalized agreement expected in 2026. They did not say how much each ship would cost or confirm a total figure for the package, citing ongoing negotiations. But Conroy said the government had allowed AU$10 billion for the project over the next 10 years. It forms part of the AU$55 billion that Australia has budgeted for the navy’s entire surface combatant fleet during the same period. —- Associated Press writer Mari Yamaguchi contributed from Tokyo."
Mexican ranchers struggle to adapt as a tiny parasite ravages their cattle exports to the US,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/mexican-ranchers-struggle-to-adapt-as-a-tiny-parasite-ravages-their-cattle-exports-to-the-us-2025-08-04/,"HERMOSILLO, Mexico (AP) — The United States’ suspension of live cattle imports from Mexico hit at the worst possible time for rancher Martín Ibarra Vargas, who after two years of severe drought had hoped to put his family on better footing selling his calves across the northern border. Like his father and grandfather before him, Ibarra Vargas has raised cattle on the parched soil of Sonora, the state in northwestern Mexico that shares a long border with the United States, particularly Arizona. His family has faced punishing droughts before but has never before had to contend with the economic hit of a new scourge: the New World Screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite. U.S. agriculture officials halted live cattle crossing the border in July – the third suspension of the past eight months — due to concerns about the flesh-eating maggot which has been found in southern Mexico and is creeping north. The screwworm is a larva of the Cochliomyia hominivorax fly that can invade the tissues of any warm-blooded animal, including humans. The parasite enters animals’ skin, causing severe damage and lesions that can be fatal. Infected animals are a serious threat to herds. The U.S. Department of Agriculture calls it a ""devastating pest"" and said in June that it poses a threat to “our livestock industry, our economy, and our food supply chain.” It has embarked on other steps to keep it out of the United States, which eradicated it decades ago. As part of its strategy the U.S. is preparing to breed billions of sterile flies and release them in Mexico and southern Texas. The aim is for the sterile males to mate with females in the wild who then produce no offspring. The U.S. ban on live cattle also applies to horses and bison imports. It hit a ranching sector already weakened by drought and specifically a cattle export business that generated $1.2 billion for Mexico last year. This year, Mexican ranchers have exported fewer than 200,000 head of cattle, which is less than half what they historically send in the same period. For Ibarra Vargas, considered a comparatively small rancher by Sonora’s beef-centric standards, the inability to send his calves across the border has made him rethink everything. The repeated bans on Mexican cows by U.S. authorities has pushed his family to branch into beekeeping, raising sheep and selling cow's milk. What he earns is just a fraction of what he earned by exporting live cattle, but he is trying to hold on through the lean times. “Tiempos de vacas flacas"" — times of the lean cows — as he calls them. “At least it lets us continue” ranching, the 57-year-old said with a white cowboy hat perched on his head. Even as ranchers in Sonora intensify their efforts to make sure the parasitic fly never makes it into their state, they’ve had to seek new markets. In the past two months, they’ve sold more than 35,000 mature cows within Mexico at a significant loss. “We couldn’t wait any longer,” said Juan Carlos Ochoa, president of the Sonora Regional Cattle Union. Those sales, he said, came at a “35% lower price difference compared with the export value of a cow.” That’s hard to stomach when beef prices in the U.S. are rising. The U.S. first suspended cattle imports last November. Since then, more than 2,258 cases of screwworm have been identified in Mexico. Treatment requires a mix of manually removing the maggots, healing the lesions on the cows and using anti-parasite medicine. Some ranchers have also started retail beef sales through luxury butcher shops referred to as “meat boutiques."" There are other foreign markets, for example Japan, but selling vacuum sealed steaks across the Pacific is a dramatically different business than driving calves to U.S. feedlots. The switch is not easy. With his calves mooing as they ran from one end of a small corral to the other waiting to be fed, Ibarra Vargas said he still hasn’t figured out how he will survive an extended period of not being able to send them to the U.S. The recent two-year drought reduced his cattle stocks and forced him to take on debt to save the small family ranch that has survived for three generations. Juan Carlos Anaya, director of Agricultural Markets Consulting Group, attributed a 2% drop in Mexico’s cattle inventory last year to the drought. Anaya said Mexican ranchers who export are trying to get the U.S. to separate what happens in southern Mexico from the cattle exporting states in the north where stricter health and sanitation measures are taken, “but the damage is already done.” “We’re running out of time,” said Ibarra Vargas, who already laments that his children are not interested in carrying on the family business. For a rancher who “doesn’t have a market or money to continue feeding his calves, it’s a question of time before he says: ‘you know what, this is as far as I go.’” __ Sánchez reported from Mexico City."
"In rejecting the jobs report, Trump follows his own playbook of discrediting unfavorable data",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/in-rejecting-the-jobs-report-trump-follows-his-own-playbook-of-discrediting-unfavorable-data-2025-08-04/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — When the coronavirus surged during President Donald Trump’s first term, he called for a simple fix: Limit the amount of testing so the deadly outbreak looked less severe. When he lost the 2020 election, he had a ready-made reason: The vote count was fraudulent. And on Friday, when the July jobs report revisions showed a distressed economy, Trump had an answer: He fired the official in charge of the data and called the report of a sharp slowdown in hiring “phony.” Trump has a go-to playbook if the numbers reveal uncomfortable realities, and that’s to discredit or conceal the figures and to attack the messenger — all of which can hurt the president's efforts to convince the world that America is getting stronger. “Our democratic system and the strength of our private economy depend on the honest flow of information about our economy, our government and our society,” said Douglas Elmendorf, a Harvard University professor who was formerly director of the Congressional Budget Office. “The Trump administration is trying to suppress honest analysis.” The president's strategy carries significant risks for his own administration and a broader economy that depends on politics-free data. His denouncements threaten to lower trust in government and erode public accountability, and any manipulation of federal data could result in policy choices made on faulty numbers, causing larger problems for both the president and the country. The White House disputes any claims that Trump wants to hide numbers that undermine his preferred narratives. It emphasized that Goldman Sachs found that the two-month revisions on the jobs report were the largest since 1968, outside of a recession, and that should be a source of concern regarding the integrity of the data. Trump's aides say their fundamental focus is ensuring that any data gives an accurate view of reality. Trump has a long history of dismissing data when it reflects poorly on him and extolling or even fabricating more favorable numbers, a pattern that includes his net worth, his family business, election results and government figures: — Judge Arthur Engoron ruled in a lawsuit brought by the state of New York that Trump and his company deceived banks, insurers and others by massively overvaluing his assets and exaggerating his net worth on paperwork used in making deals and securing loans. — Trump has claimed that the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections were each rigged. Trump won the 2016 presidential election by clinching the Electoral College, but he lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton, a sore spot that led him to falsely claim that millions of immigrants living in the country illegally had cast ballots. He lost the 2020 election to Joe Biden but falsely claimed he had won it, despite multiple lawsuits failing to prove his case. — In 2019, as Hurricane Dorian neared the East Coast, Trump warned Alabama that the storm was coming its way. Forecasters pushed back, saying Alabama was not at risk. Trump later displayed a map in the Oval Office that had been altered with a black Sharpie — his signature pen — to include Alabama in the potential path of the storm. — Trump's administration has stopped posting reports on climate change, canceled studies on vaccine access and removed data on gender identity from government sites. — As pandemic deaths mounted, Trump suggested that there should be less testing. “When you do testing to that extent, you’re going to find more people,” Trump said at a June 2020 rally in Oklahoma. “You’re going to find more cases. So I said to my people, ‘Slow the testing down, please.’” While Trump's actions have drawn outcry from economists, scientists and public interest groups, Elmendorf noted that Trump's actions regarding economic data could be tempered by Congress, which could put limits on Trump by whom he chooses to lead federal agencies, for example. “Outside observers can only do so much,"" Elmendorf said. “The power to push back against the president rests with the Congress. They have not exercised that power, but they could.” Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, took aim at the size of the downward revisions in the jobs report (a combined 258,000 reduction in May and June) to suggest that the report had credibility issues. He said Trump is focused on getting dependable numbers, despite the president linking the issue to politics by claiming the revisions were meant to make Republicans look bad. “The president wants his own people there so that when we see the numbers, they’re more transparent and more reliable,” Hassett said Sunday on NBC News. Jed Kolko, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics who oversaw the Census Bureau and Bureau of Economic Analysis during the Biden administration, stressed that revisions to the jobs data are standard. That's because the numbers are published monthly, but not all surveys used are returned quickly enough to be in the initial publishing of the jobs report. “Revisions solve the tension between timeliness and accuracy,” Kolko said. “We want timely data because policymakers and businesses and investors need to make decisions with the best data that's available, but we also want accuracy.” Kolko stressed the importance in ensuring that federal statistics are trustworthy not just for government policymakers but for the companies trying to gauge the overall direction of the economy when making hiring and investment choices. “Businesses are less likely to make investments if they can't trust data about how the economy is doing,” he said. Not every part of the jobs report was deemed suspect by the Trump administration. Before Trump ordered the firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, the White House rapid response social media account reposted a statement by Vice President JD Vance noting that native-born citizens were getting jobs and immigrants were not, drawing from data in the household tables in the jobs report. Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer also trumpeted the findings on native-born citizens, noting on Fox Business Network's “Varney & Co.” that they are accounting ""for all of the job growth, and that’s key.” During his first run for the presidency, Trump criticized the economic data as being fake only to fully embrace the positive numbers shortly after he first entered the White House in 2017. The challenge of reliable data goes beyond economic figures to basic information on climate change and scientific research. In July, taxpayer-funded reports on the problems climate change is creating for America and its population disappeared from government websites. The White House initially said NASA would post the reports in compliance with a 1990 law, but the agency later said it would not because any legal obligations were already met by having reports submitted to Congress. The White House maintains that it has operated with complete openness, posting a picture of Trump on Monday on social media with the caption, “The Most Transparent President in History.” In the picture, Trump had his back to the camera and was covered in shadows, visibly blocking out most of the light in front of him. ___ Associated Press writer Michelle Price in Washington contributed to this report.

Nations will try again on plan to confront world's 'spiraling' plastic pollution mess,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/nations-will-try-again-on-plan-to-confront-worlds-spiraling-plastic-pollution-mess-2025-08-04/,"Nations gather in Geneva Tuesday to try to complete a landmark treaty aimed at ending the plastic pollution crisis that affects every ecosystem and person on the planet. It’s the sixth time negotiators are meeting and they hope the last. A key split is whether the treaty should require cutting plastic production, with powerful oil-producing nations opposed; most plastic is made from fossil fuels. They say redesign, recycling and reuse can solve the problem, while other countries and some major companies say that’s not enough. Only a treaty can mobilize the necessary global action, said Angelique Pouponneau, lead ocean negotiator for 39 small island and low-lying coastal developing states. At home in the Seychelles, Pouponneau said, plastic contaminates the fish they eat, piles up on beaches and chokes the ocean to undermine tourism and their way of life. “It’s the world’s final opportunity to get this done and to get it done right,” she said. “It would be a tragedy if we didn’t live up to our mandate."" United Nations Environment Programme Executive Director Inger Andersen said the issues are complex but the crisis is “really spiraling” and there's a narrow pathway to a treaty. She said many countries agree on redesigning plastic products to be recycled and improving waste management, for example. “We need to get a solution to this problem. Everybody wants it. I’ve yet to meet somebody who is in favor of plastic pollution,” Andersen said. Between 19 million and 23 million tons of plastic waste leak into aquatic ecosystems annually, that could jump 50% by 2040 without urgent action, according to the UN. In March 2022, 175 nations agreed to make the first legally binding treaty on plastics pollution by the end of 2024. It was to address the full life cycle of plastic, including production, design and disposal. Talks last year in South Korea were supposed to be the final round, but they adjourned in December at an impasse over cutting production. Every year, the world makes more than 400 million tons of new plastic, and that could grow by about 70% by 2040 without policy changes. About 100 countries want to limit production as well as tackle cleanup and recycling. Many have said it's essential to address toxic chemicals. Panama led an effort in South Korea to address production in the treaty. Negotiator Debbra Cisneros said they'll do so again in Geneva because they strongly believe in addressing pollution at the source, not just through downstream measures like waste management. “If we shy away from that ambition now, we risk adopting an agreement that is politically convenient, but environmentally speaking, is ineffective,” she said. About 300 businesses that are members of the Business Coalition for a Global Plastics Treaty — companies such as Walmart, the Coca-Cola Company, PepsiCo, and L’Oréal — support reducing production along with increasing recycling and reuse. The coalition includes major food and beverage companies and retailers who want an effective, binding treaty with global rules to spare them the headaches of differing approaches in different countries. Some plastic-producing and oil and gas countries firmly oppose production limits. Saudi Arabia, the world's largest exporter of one common type of plastic, has led that group in asserting there should be no problem producing plastic if the world addresses plastic pollution. The U.S. doesn’t support global production caps or bans on certain plastic products or chemical additives to them. The State Department says it supports provisions to improve waste collection and management, improve product design and drive recycling, reuse and other efforts to cut the plastic dumped into the environment. “If the negotiations are to succeed, the agreement must be aimed at protecting the environment from plastic pollution, and the agreement should recognize the importance plastics play in our economies,” the State Department said in a statement to The Associated Press. That’s similar to the views of the plastics industry, which says that a production cap could have unintended consequences, such as raising the cost of plastics, and that chemicals are best regulated elsewhere. China, the United States and Germany lead the global plastics trade by exports and imports, according to the Plastics Industry Association. For any proposal to make it into the treaty, every nation must agree. Some countries want to change the process so decisions may be made by a vote if necessary. India, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Kuwait and others have opposed that, arguing consensus is vital to an effective treaty. Negotiators are discussing making some provisions opt-in or opt-out to avoid a stalemate. Bjorn Beeler, international coordinator for the International Pollutants Elimination Network, said that would mean a treaty without teeth or obligations, with little value. Cisneros said that if carefully crafted, it's an option to find some common ground. Tracey Campbell, an executive vice president at the plastics and chemicals company LyondellBasell and vice chair of the executive committee of the World Plastics Council, said she'll ask negotiators to “find a way to agree on a few things and get started” and then build from there. She suggested tackling things like product redesign, recycled content mandates and financing waste collection, waste sorting and recycling technologies. In contrast, Greenpeace will be in Geneva calling for at least a 75% reduction in plastic production by 2040. “We will never recycle our way out of this problem,” said Graham Forbes, who leads the Greenpeace delegation. Delegates from most countries, the plastics industry and businesses that use plastics, environmentalists, scientists, Indigenous leaders and communities affected by plastic pollution are in Geneva. About 80 government ministers are attending talks that will last 10 days — the longest session yet, with adjournment scheduled for Aug. 14. Frankie Orona, executive director of the Texas-based Society of Native Nations, has been to every negotiating session. Indigenous land, water and air are being contaminated as fossil fuels are extracted and plastic is manufactured using hazardous chemicals, said Orona. “We feel we absolutely have to be present to let them know, and see, who are the people that are really being impacted by the plastics crisis,” he said. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Analysts Make a Quantum Bet on D-Wave's Cryogenic Packaging,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/analysts-make-a-quantum-bet-on-d-waves-cryogenic-packaging/,"In the last week of July, D-Wave Quantum Inc. NYSE: QBTS received two new Buy ratings from analysts at Canaccord Genuity and Rosenblatt Securities, as well as a $2 price target boost from B. Riley. These analyst moves come ahead of D‑Wave’s Q2 earnings, scheduled for August 7, 2025, which will provide more context for the company’s revenue trajectory and profitability outlook—either through sales of its quantum systems or, potentially, through innovative partnerships—which investors have been waiting for. So why the sudden new votes of confidence despite a lack of an update on the earnings front? One potential reason is D-Wave's recent announcement of a new strategic development initiative centered around cryogenic packaging. While this process is likely difficult for anyone without significant technical expertise in quantum computing to grasp fully, suffice to say cryogenic packaging could be transformational for D-Wave. Cryogenic packaging is a specialized method of enclosing and interconnecting quantum computing chips so they can operate at extremely low temperatures, often near absolute zero. These frigid conditions are necessary to maintain the quantum states of qubits, which are incredibly delicate and prone to decoherence from heat, noise, Gate-model quantum computing is an alternative approach to quantum computing from D-Wave's annealing tech. Annealing is known for its ability to solve optimization-related problems, making it very effective at certain applications but less so for generalized quantum computing needs. In contrast, gate-model tech is known to be more versatile. For that reason, some analysts have suggested gate-model approaches may be more likely to achieve widespread marketability than annealing approaches. Some of the biggest tech firms exploring quantum, like IBM NYSE: IBM and Alphabet Inc. NASDAQ: GOOGL, have predominantly focused their efforts on gate-model for this reason. If cryogenic packaging facilitates a rapid development in D-Wave's gate-model technology, it would put to rest the arguments of some bearish analysts who have suggested the company is pursuing a technological dead end. Thanks to its work with JPL, D-Wave has already achieved end-to-end superconducting interconnect between chips, a crucial step in this process. For an idea of how the broader market reacted to D-Wave's recent announcement, it's worth noting that shares of the company did not spike following the news. In fact, QBTS fell by some 15% in the several days before and after the announcement. As with so many developments in the quantum space, it can be difficult for individual investors to assess how significant a technological breakthrough may be for a particular company. In this case, it may be that D-Wave's other outstanding issues—its history of losses and struggles with profitability and revenue, say, or its repeated dilutive actions in order to bulk up its cash reserves—are more immediately concerning. Still, while investors should beware the potential to overhype a development like cryogenic packaging, it can point to D-Wave's continued efforts to grow its technological footprint and, with the possibility of a move toward gate-model, to respond to criticism of its prior strategy. To determine just how important that may be in the near term, investors will likely need to assess this technological update in conjunction with a fuller view of D-Wave's performance in the most recent quarter via its earnings report. The report will be the real test of whether the company can deliver on both innovation and financial execution. For now, D-Wave remains an analyst favorite, with all 10 analysts tracked by MarketBeat assigning it a Buy rating. Thanks to recent coverage, the company now has upside potential of about 2% based on a consensus price target of $16.70. Before you consider D-Wave Quantum, you'll want to hear this."
"Company advised by Trump sons said it hoped to benefit from fed money, then took it back",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/company-advised-by-trump-sons-said-it-hoped-to-benefit-from-fed-money-then-took-it-back-2025-08-04/,"NEW YORK (AP) — A public document filed by a company that just hired President Donald Trump’s two oldest sons as advisers included a sentence early Monday that said it hoped to benefit from grants and other incentives from the federal government, which their father happens to lead. But when The Associated Press asked the Trump family business about the apparent conflict of interest, the document was revised and the line taken out. Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. are getting “founder shares” worth millions of dollars in New America Acquisition 1 Corp., a company with no operating business that hopes to fill that hole by purchasing an American company that can play “a meaningful role in revitalizing domestic manufacturing,” according to the filing. The president has geared his trade policy toward boosting manufacturing in the U.S. The original version of the securities filing said the target company should be “well positioned” to tap federal or state government incentives. That reference was taken out of the revised version. The Trump Organization didn't reply to a question about whether New America still planned to benefit from government programs or why the line was cut. But the outside law firm Paul Hastings that helped prepare the document sent an email to AP saying it was “mistake” made by “scriveners,” an old term for transcribers of legal papers. Kathleen Clark, an expert in government ethics, said any excuses are too late because the Trumps had already tipped their hand. “They just deleted the language. They haven’t committed not to do what they said earlier today they were planning to do,"" said the Washington University law professor and Trump critic. ""It's an attempt to exploit public office for private profit.” New America is what’s know as a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC. It’s a publicly traded company that exists solely to use its funds to acquire another company and take the target public. New America plans to raise money by selling new stock on the New York Stock Exchange at $10 a share. That will hand the two Trump sons a potential total of $50 million in paper wealth the moment the stock begins trading on the first day. The company hopes to sell enough shares to raise $300 million, which it then plans to use buying a yet unidentified manufacturer. A press release issued by New America saying it was focused on “American values and priorities."" It made no mention of the aim to get government incentives. The filing to New America's potential new investors to the Securities and Exchange Commission was explicit about what it was looking for in a target company. It said, among other things, it wanted a company that can ride “public policy tailwinds"" by benefiting from federal or state “grants, tax credits, government contracts or preferential procurement programs.”"
"Trump says he doesn't trust the jobs data, but Wall Street and economists do",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/how-reliable-is-the-jobs-data-economists-and-wall-street-still-trust-it-2025-08-04/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The monthly jobs report is already closely-watched on Wall Street and in Washington but has taken on a new importance after President Donald Trump on Friday fired the official who oversees it. Trump claimed that June's employment figures were “RIGGED” to make him and other Republicans “look bad.” Yet he provided no evidence and even the official Trump had appointed in his first term to oversee the report, William Beach, condemned the firing of Erika McEntarfer, the director of the Bureau of Labor Statistics appointed by former President Joe Biden. The firing followed Friday's jobs report that showed hiring was weak in July and had come to nearly a standstill in May and June, right after Trump rolled out sweeping tariffs. Economists and Wall Street investors have long considered the job figures reliable, with share prices and bond yields often reacting sharply when they are released. Yet Friday’s revisions were unusually large — the largest, outside of a recession, in five decades. And the surveys used to compile the report are facing challenges from declining response rates, particularly since COVID, as fewer companies complete the surveys. Nonetheless, that hasn't led most economists to doubt them. “The bottom line for me is, I wouldn’t take the low collection rate as any evidence that the numbers are less reliable,” Omair Sharif, founder and chief economist at Inflation Insights, a consulting firm, said. Many academics, statisticians and economists have warned for some time that declining budgets were straining the government's ability to gather economic data. There were several government commissions studying ways to improve things like survey response rates, but the Trump administration disbanded them earlier this year. Heather Boushey, a top economic adviser in the Biden White House, noted that without Trump's firing of McEntarfer, there would be more focus on last week's data, which points to a slowing economy. “We’re having this conversation about made-up issues to distract us from what the data is showing,"" Boushey said. “Revisions of this magnitude in a negative direction may indicate bad things to come for the labor market.” Here are some things to know about the jobs report: Most economists say that the Bureau of Labor Statistics is a nonpolitical agency staffed by people obsessed with getting the numbers right. The only political appointee is the commissioner, who doesn't see the data until it's finalized, two days before it is issued to the public. Erica Groshen, the BLS commissioner from 2013 to 2017, said she suggested different language in the report to ""liven it up"", but was shot down. She was told that if asked to describe a cup as half-empty or half-full, BLS says “it is an eight ounce cup with four ounces of liquid.” The revised jobs data that has attracted Trump's ire is actually more in line with other figures than before the revision. For example, payroll processor ADP uses data from its millions of clients to calculate its own jobs report, and it showed a sharp hiring slowdown in May and June that is closer to the revised BLS data. Trump and his White House have a long track record of celebrating the jobs numbers — when they are good. Trump has focused on the revisions to the May and June data, which on Friday were revised lower, with job gains in May reduced to 19,000 from 144,000, and for June to just 14,000 from 147,000. Every month's jobs data is revised in the following two months. Trump also repeated a largely inaccurate attack from the campaign about an annual revision last August, which reduced total employment in the United States by 818,000, or about 0.5%. The government also revises employment figures every year. Trump charged the annual revision was released before the 2024 presidential election to “boost” Vice President Kamala Harris's ""chances of Victory,"" yet it was two months before the election and widely reported at the time that the revision lowered hiring during the Biden-Harris administration and pointed to a weaker economy. The monthly revisions occur because many companies that respond to the government's surveys send their data in late, or correct the figures they've already submitted. The proportion of companies sending in their data later has risen in the past decade. Every year, the BLS does an additional revision based on actual job counts that are derived from state unemployment insurance records. Those figures cover 95% of U.S. businesses and aren't derived from a survey but are not available in real time. Figuring out how many new jobs have been added or lost each month is more complicated than it may sound. For example, if one person takes a second job, should you focus on the number of jobs, which has increased, or the number of employed people, which hasn't? (The government measures both: The unemployment rate is based on how many people either have or don't have jobs, while the number of jobs added or lost is counted separately). Each month, the government surveys about 121,000 businesses and government agencies at over 630,000 locations — including multiple locations for the same business — covering about one-third of all workers. Still, the government also has to make estimates: What if a company goes out of business? It likely won't fill out any forms showing the jobs lost. And what about new businesses? They can take a while to get on the government's radar. The BLS seeks to capture these trends by estimating their impact on employment. Those estimates can be wrong, of course, until they are fixed by the annual revisions. The revisions are often larger around turning points in the economy. For example, when the economy is growing, there may be more startups than the government expects, so revisions will be higher. If the economy is slowing or slipping into a recession, the revisions may be larger on the downside. Ernie Tedeschi, an economic adviser to the Biden administration, points to the current dynamics of the labor market: Both hiring and firing have sharply declined, and fewer Americans are quitting their jobs to take other work. As a result, most of the job gains or losses each month are probably occurring at new companies, or those going out of business. And those are the ones the government uses models to estimate, which can make them more volatile. Groshen also points out that since the pandemic there has been a surge of new start-up companies, after many Americans lost their jobs or sought more independence. Yet they may not have created as many jobs as startups did pre-COVID, which throws off the government’s models. The revisions to May and June's job totals, which reduced hiring by a total of 258,000, were the largest — outside recessions — since 1967, according to economists at Goldman Sachs. Kevin Hassett, Trump's top economic adviser, went on NBC's “Meet the Press” on Sunday and said, “What we’ve seen over the last few years is massive revisions to the jobs numbers.” Hassett blamed a sharp drop in response rates to the government's surveys during and after the pandemic: “When COVID happened, because response rates went down a lot, then revision rates skyrocketed.” Yet calculations by Tedeschi show that while revisions spiked after the pandemic, they have since declined and are much smaller than in the 1960s and 1970s. Many economists and statisticians have sounded the alarm about things like declining response rates for years. A decade ago, about 60% of companies surveyed by BLS responded. Now, only about 40% do. The decline has been an international phenomenon, particularly since COVID. The United Kingdom has even suspended publication of an official unemployment rate because of falling responses. And earlier this year the BLS said that it was cutting back on its collection of inflation data because of the Trump administration's hiring freeze, raising concerns about the robustness of price data just as economists are trying to gauge the impact of tariffs on inflation. U.S. government statistical agencies have seen an inflation-adjusted 16% drop in funding since 2009, according to a July report from the American Statistical Association. “We are at an inflection point,” the report said. “To meet current and future challenges requires thoughtful, well-planned investment ... In contrast, what we have observed is uncoordinated and unplanned reductions with no visible plan for the future."
Owners of cargo ship that crashed into Baltimore bridge sue company that built vessel,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/owners-of-cargo-ship-that-crashed-into-baltimore-bridge-sue-company-that-built-vessel-2025-08-04/,"ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) — The owners of the cargo ship that crashed into the Francis Scott Key Bridge are suing the company that built the vessel, alleging negligence in the design of a critical switchboard on the ship. Grace Ocean Private and Synergy Marine PTE Ltd, the owners of the Dali, filed the lawsuit last week against Hyundai Heavy Industries in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. “As a result of the defectively designed Switchboard, the Vessel suffered a power outage that led to the allision with the Key Bridge,” Grace Ocean Private alleges in the lawsuit. Hyundai Heavy Industries could not immediately be reached for comment. Court records in the case did not name legal representatives for Hyundai. Grace Ocean Private contends the switchboard was defectively designed in a manner that wiring connections were not secure. The defect, the company alleges, “caused the switchboard and the vessel to be unreasonably dangerous ... when it left HHI's control."" “HHI’s defective manufacture of the Switchboard and Vessel caused the signal wiring to come loose in normal operation, resulting in the power outage that led to the allision,” the lawsuit says. The Dali was leaving Baltimore bound for Sri Lanka on March 26 last year when its steering failed due to the power loss. It crashed into one of the bridge’s supporting columns, destroying the 1.6-mile span and killing six members of a roadwork crew. Baltimore’s port was closed for months, and increased traffic congestion remains a problem across the region. The Justice Department last year filed a lawsuit seeking to recover more than $100 million that the government spent to clear the underwater debris and reopen the city’s port. The owner and manager of the cargo ship agreed to pay more than $102 million in cleanup costs to settle the lawsuit brought by the government. In that lawsuit, the Justice Department alleged the owner and manager of the cargo ship recklessly cut corners and ignored known electrical problems on the vessel. In particular, the Justice Department accused the ship owner of failing to address “excessive vibrations” that were causing electrical problems. The National Transportation Safety Board said in its preliminary report last year that the Dali experienced electrical blackouts about 10 hours before leaving the Port of Baltimore, and yet again shortly before it slammed into the bridge. Last week, Maryland officials visited the site where demolition crews are using giant saws, backhoes and other heavy equipment to remove large sections of the remaining pieces of the bridge. Its replacement is expected to open in 2028. Before you consider Eastern, you'll want to hear this."
Traders Turn Bullish on Housing Stocks Again—3 Leading the Way,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/traders-turn-bullish-on-housing-stocks-again3-leading-the-way/,"After being left behind on the broader S&P 500 rally, it seems the real estate sector is now cold enough (and cheap enough) for some Wall Street participants to start considering it again. This time around, spotting unusual call options trading activity can lead investors to where these high convictions are for the market, especially in the homebuilding industry. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF NYSEARCA: XHB has reported an unusual level of interest coming from options traders on the call side, which is fundamentally a bet that the entire space is going to see higher prices in the coming months. Spotting these trades is crucial due to options' inherent leverage and expiration, which raises the stakes even higher for those who invest a substantial amount of capital in any given idea. However, those investors looking for the outsized return opportunities in homebuilding names could (and should) do some individual stock picking for their portfolios, which is where today’s list comes into play. Builders like PulteGroup Inc. NYSE: PHM, Lennar Corp. NYSE: LEN, and Toll Brothers Inc. NYSE: TOL are at the top of the queue, primed for the next wave of market action. Even though this homebuilder still trades at only 78% of its 52-week high level, keeping it within an official bear market, the recent price action seems to show a potential underlying change happening right now. Over the past quarter, this stock has delivered a net return of 11.7%, indicating a slightly more positive sentiment to investors. With this price action in mind, it shouldn’t be a surprise for investors to see some institutions focused on these momentum strategies have bought into PulteGroup stock recently. As of late July 2025, those from Nordea Investment Management have justified a 2.8% boost in their PulteGroup holdings, bringing their stakes to a high of $94 million today. Perhaps it is the housing market's bottoming cycle, with data from building permits to mortgage applications showing a potential turnaround for the second half of 2025. The catalyst behind this shift could be credited to the Federal Reserve and the speculation that interest rate cuts could be hitting the economy in this time horizon. Knowing these factors are at play for this homebuilder, UBS analyst John Lovallo decided to express his optimism on the future of the company through a Buy rating. This view came coupled with a valuation boost to $150 per share. From where the stock trades today, this call implies an additional upside potential of 29%. One of the main drivers behind a stock’s price action is its underlying earnings per share (EPS) growth rate. Lennar stock has grown enough to make investors consider a new potential ceiling in the company’s valuation. Compared to today’s reported $1.90 in EPS, Wall Street analysts and their forecasts for $3.09 in EPS for the fourth quarter of 2025 imply that Lennar could deliver a net EPS growth rate of roughly 60% to justify a similar jump in the stock’s price action in percentage terms. Whether this scenario unfolds will depend on the fundamental setups and catalysts at play, particularly a rebound in housing data, such as permits and mortgage applications, which will be directly influenced by the Fed's decisions before 2025. As of the company’s latest quarterly results, it seems that this turnaround might be taking on water, considering that new orders reached 22,601 total homes for an annual growth rate of 6%, not a figure that is expected from a slowing business. Over the past month alone, 9.1% of Toll Brothers’ short interest declined in a sign of potential bearish capitulation, especially as more and more participants realize that the macro backdrop has now created an asymmetrical setup that favors the bulls over anyone else. With this setup in mind, it should be expected that some investors in the market are now willing to take advantage of this opportunity, especially now that the stock has traded down to only 72% of its 52-week high, to amplify the fact that it is a fantastic risk-to-reward ratio for buyers to take advantage of. Allocators from Jennison Associates justified adding an extra 11.2% to their overall Toll Brothers stock holdings as of August 2025, a recent transaction that netted their position to a high of $81.5 million today, also making them one of the largest institutional holders of the company as of today’s terms. It appears that the conviction behind the SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF can be particularly focused on these three homebuilders, giving investors an unfair advantage before the rest of the market catches up on this trend.

Post to Coast: New York Post plans a California newspaper,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/post-to-coast-new-york-post-plans-a-california-newspaper-2025-08-04/,"NEW YORK (AP) — The New York Post is launching a California tabloid newspaper and news site next year, the company announced Monday, bringing an assertive, irreverent and conservative-friendly fixture of the Big Apple media landscape to the Golden State. In the process, it is creating a 21st-century rarity: a new American newspaper with a robust print edition. Adding another title to Rupert Murdoch 's media empire, The California Post is setting out to cover politics, local news, business, entertainment and sports in the nation's most populous state, while drawing and building on the venerable New York paper's national coverage. Plans for the Los Angeles-based paper call for a print edition seven days a week plus a website, social media accounts and video and audio pieces. “There is no doubt that the Post will play a crucial role in engaging and enlightening readers, who are starved of serious reporting and puckish wit,” Robert Thomson, chief executive of Post corporate parent News Corp., said in a statement. In typically brash and punchy Post fashion, he portrayed California as plagued by ”jaundiced, jaded journalism."" However bold its intentions, the venture is being launched into a turbulent atmosphere for the news business, particularly for print papers. More than 3,200 of them have closed nationwide since 2005, according to figures kept by Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism. The online world spawned new information sources and influencers, changed news consumers' tastes and habits and upended the advertising market on which newspapers relied. “While it’s true the media landscape is challenging, The New York Post has been finding success through its unique voice, editorial lens and quality coverage. That same formula is tailor-made for California,” said the New York Post Media Group. It includes the Post and some other media properties. California, with a population of nearly 40 million, still has hundreds of newspapers, including dailies in and around Los Angeles and other major cities. But the nation’s second-most-populous city hasn’t had a dedicated tabloid focused on regional issues in recent memory, according to Danny Bakewell, president of the Los Angeles Press Club. “It’s really an untested market here,” said Bakewell, who is editor-in-chief of the Los Angeles Sentinel, a weekly focused on the city’s Black population. “L.A. is always ready for good-quality news reporting, and particularly in this moment when so many other papers are shrinking and disappearing, it could be a really unique opportunity.” There is no U.S. newspaper quite like the 224-year-old New York Post. It was founded by no less a luminary than Alexander Hamilton, the country’s first treasury secretary, an author of the Federalist Papers, the victim of a duel at the hands of the vice president and the inspiration for the Broadway smash “Hamilton.” Murdoch, News Corp.’s founder and now its chairman emeritus, bought the Post in 1976, sold it a dozen years later, then repurchased it in 1993. The Post is known for its relentless and skewering approach to reporting, its facility with sensational or racy subject matter, its Page Six gossip column, and the paper's huge and often memorable front-page headlines — see, for example, 1983’s “Headless Body in Topless Bar.” At the same time, the Post is a player in both local and national politics. It routinely pushes, from the right, on “wokeness” and other culture-war pressure points, and it has broken such political stories as the Hunter Biden laptop saga. The Post has an avid reader in President Donald Trump, who gave its “Pod Force One” podcast an interview as recently as last month. In recent years, the Post's website and such related sites as PageSix.com have built a large and far-flung digital audience, 90% of it outside the New York media market, according to the company. With the Los Angeles readership second only to New York's, The California Post ""is the next manifestation of our national brand,” Editor-in-Chief Keith Poole said in a statement. He'll also be involved in overseeing the California paper with its editor-in-chief, Nick Papps, who has worked with News Corp.'s Australian outlets for decades, including a stint as an L.A.-based correspondent. The company didn't specify how many journalists The California Post will have. ___ Associated Press writer Jake Offenhartz contributed from Los Angeles.

"North Carolina DMV audit recommends reforms to reverse customer wait times, worker morale",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/north-carolina-dmv-audit-recommends-reforms-to-reverse-customer-wait-times-worker-morale-2025-08-04/,"RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — Customers at North Carolina's Division of Motor Vehicles are waiting longer in lines that are often far away from home, while agency staffing fails to keep pace with the state's surging population, according to agency reviews that also recommend major reforms. Elected Republican State Auditor Dave Boliek on Monday released two audits totaling nearly 600 pages that scrutinize the DMV — the bane of motorists in many states. But long lines and frustrations are acute in the ninth-largest state. “Our DMV affects the economy. It affects people having to take off of work unnecessarily. It takes our students out of the classroom,” Boliek told reporters. “This has to be fixed and it has to be a top priority.” Boliek promised during last year’s campaign to conduct a top-to-bottom review of the DMV if elected. Elected leaders' constituents have complained about the inability to book appointments online close to home and the struggles for their teenagers to complete driving tests. It’s not unusual for customers to camp outside driver’s license offices in the wee hours hoping to get seen later that day. Problems continued as federal REAL ID license security requirements took effect in May. Erin Van Dorn of Holly Springs said at Boliek's news conference it took her and her teenage son four trips to the DMV — the last time 130 miles (209 kilometers) away in Mount Airy — to obtain his license. Information technology and staffing shortages were to blame. “My son has missed a total of four days of school,” Van Horn said while mentioning additonal delays. “It’s just been a very big ordeal for us.” New Democratic Gov. Josh Stein’s administration brought in former state legislator Paul Tine as the new Division of Motor Vehicles commissioner and has pledged a turnaround. A DMV performance audit Monday said average wait times for customers at the state’s driver’s license locations increased by over 15% since 2019 to 1 hour and 15 minutes. And close to 14% of the visits lasted over 2 hours and 30 minutes — a 79% increase from 2019. And nearly half of all transactions by customers aren't happening at the license office closest to where they live. “The employee experience has diminished as well,” Boliek said. The audit said there were 160 vacant license examiner positions as of April. And while the state's population has grown by 29% over the last 20 years, the number of examiner positions has grown by just 10%. Boliek's staff heard DMV employee complaints about burnout, security and low pay — average examiner position salaries were well below $50,000 last year. The audit attributes many problems to DMV's relationship with the Cabinet-level state Department of Transportation that oversees the agency. The auditor said DMV has undersized influence within DOT when it comes to decision-making and getting budget requests approved by the legislature. Boliek's most significant recommendation is for policymakers to consider turning DMV into an autonomous agency separate from DOT. Boliek said the recommendation is no slight upon Tine and current Teansportation Secretary Joey Hopkins, whom he said are taking steps toward reform. But he said a permanent change is needed to address situations where the commissioner and secretary wouldn't cooperate as well. Other recommendations include creating a public online dashboard measuring keys performance goals and initiating nonconventional initiatives to reduce wait times and backlogs. Boliek said outside driving school instructors could administer road tests required of new drivers. The DMV could open “pop-up” license offices at a vacant mall anchor store or create “fast-pass” options for customers who pay extra to reach the front of the line. “We can’t keep doing things the same old way,"" he said. In a written response to the audits, Tine and Hopkins agreed with nearly all of the recommendations and said many already getting carried out. But they opposed the recommendation to separate DMV, saying the agency's core functions align with the Transportation Department's mission to improve highway safety. “We know that with the right leadership and follow-through, we will get results -– getting people out of lines and empowering our hard-working DMV employees,"" Stein spokesperson Morgan Hopkins said. The GOP-controlled General Assembly could still attempt to implement the change. A stopgap budget measure on Stein’s desk provides funds to hire over 60 license examiners. And a new state law has established a temporary moratorium on renewing standard licenses, allowing them to remain valid within North Carolina for up to two years beyond the expiration date."
Modi and Trump once called each other good friends. Now the US-India relationship is getting bumpy,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/modi-and-trump-once-called-each-other-good-friends-now-the-us-india-relationship-is-getting-bumpy-2025-08-04/,"NEW DELHI (AP) — The men shared bear hugs, showered praise on each other and made appearances side by side at stadium rallies — a big optics boost for two populist leaders with ideological similarities. Each called the other a good friend. In India, the bonhomie between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and U.S. President Donald Trump was seen as a relationship like no other. That is, until a series of events gummed up the works. From Trump’s tariffs and India’s purchase of oil from Russia to a U.S. tilt toward Pakistan, friction between New Delhi and Washington has been hard to miss. And much of it has happened far from the corridors of power and, unsurprisingly, through Trump’s posts on social media. It has left policy experts wondering whether the camaraderie the two leaders shared may be a thing of the past, even though Trump has stopped short of referring to Modi directly on social media. The dip in rapport, some say, puts a strategic bilateral relationship built over decades at risk. “This is a testing time for the relationship,” said Ashok Malik, a former policy adviser in India’s Foreign Ministry. The White House did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment. The latest hiccup between India and the U.S. emerged last week when Trump announced that he was slapping 25% tariffs on India as well as an unspecified penalty because of India’s purchasing of Russian oil. For New Delhi, such a move from its largest trading partner is expected to be felt across sectors, but it also led to a sense of unease in India — even more so when Trump, on social media, called India’s economy “dead.” Trump’s recent statements reflect his frustration with the pace of trade talks with India, according to a White House official who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity to describe internal administration thinking. The Republican president has not been pursuing any strategic realignment with Pakistan, according to the official, but is instead trying to play hardball in negotiations. Trump doubled down on the pressure Monday with a fresh post on Truth Social, in which he accused India of buying “massive amounts” of oil from Russia and then “selling it on the Open Market for big profits.” “They don’t care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian War Machine. Because of this, I will be substantially raising the Tariff paid by India to the USA,” he said. The messaging appears to have stung Modi’s administration, which has been hard-selling negotiations with Trump’s team over a trade deal by balancing between India’s protectionist system while also opening up the country’s market to more American goods. “Strenuous, uninterrupted and bipartisan efforts in both capitals over the past 25 years are being put at risk by not just the tariffs but by fast and loose statements and social media posts,” said Malik, who now heads the India chapter of The Asia Group, a U.S. advisory firm . Malik also said the trade deal the Indian side has offered to the U.S. is the “most expansive in this country’s history,” referring to reports that India was willing to open up to some American agricultural products. That is a politically sensitive issue for Modi, who faced a yearlong farmers’ protest a few years ago. The unraveling may have gained momentum over tariffs, but the tensions have been palpable for a while. Much of it has to do with Trump growing closer to Pakistan, India’s nuclear rival in the neighborhood. In May, India and Pakistan traded a series of military strikes over a gun massacre in disputed Kashmir that New Delhi blamed Islamabad for. Pakistan denied the accusations. The four-day conflict made the possibility of a nuclear conflagration between the two sides seem real and the fighting only stopped when global powers intervened. But it was Trump’s claims of mediation and an offer to work to provide a “solution” regarding the dispute over Kashmir that made Modi’s administration uneasy. Since then, Trump has repeated nearly two dozen times that he brokered peace between India and Pakistan. For Modi, that is a risky — even nervy — territory. Domestically, he has positioned himself as a leader who is tough on Pakistan. Internationally, he has made huge diplomatic efforts to isolate the country. So Trump’s claims cut a deep wound, prompting a sense in India that the U.S. may no longer be its strategic partner. India insists that Kashmir is India’s internal issue and had opposed any third-party intervention. Last week Modi appeared to dismiss Trump’s claims after India’s Opposition began demanding answers from him. Modi said that “no country in the world stopped” the fighting between India and Pakistan, but he did not name Trump. Trump has also appeared to be warming up to Pakistan, even praising its counterterrorism efforts. Hours after levying tariffs on India, Trump announced a “massive” oil exploration deal with Pakistan, saying that some day, India might have to buy oil from Islamabad. Earlier, he also hosted one of Pakistan’s top military officials at a private lunch. Sreeram Sundar Chaulia, an expert at New Delhi’s Jindal School of International Affairs, said Trump’s sudden admiration for Pakistan as a great partner in counterterrorism has “definitely soured” the mood in India. Chaulia said “the best-case scenario is that this is just a passing Trump whim,” but he also warned that “if financial and energy deals are indeed being struck between the U.S. and Pakistan, it will dent the U.S.-India strategic partnership and lead to loss of confidence in the U.S. in Indian eyes.” The strain in relations has also to do with oil. India had faced strong pressure from the Biden administration to cut back its oil purchases from Moscow during the early months of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Instead, India bought more, making it the second-biggest buyer of Russian oil after China. That pressure sputtered over time and the U.S. focused more on building strategic ties with India, which is seen as a bulwark against a rising China. Trump’s threat to penalize India over oil, however, brought back those issues. On Sunday, the Trump administration made its frustrations over ties between India and Russia ever more public. Stephen Miller, deputy chief of staff at the White House, accused India of financing Russia’s war in Ukraine by purchasing oil from Moscow, saying it was “not acceptable.” Miller's remarks were followed by another Trump social media post on Monday in which he again threatened to raise tariffs on goods from India over its Russian oil purchases. “India is not only buying massive amounts of Russian Oil, they are then, for much of the Oil purchased, selling it on the Open Market for big profits. They don’t care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian War Machine,"" Trump wrote. Some experts, though, suspect Trump's remarks are mere pressure tactics. “Given the wild fluctuations in Trump’s policies,” Chaulia said, “it may return to high fives and hugs again.” Many expected India to react strongly over Trump's tariff threats considering Modi’s carefully crafted reputation of strength. Instead, the announcement prompted a rather careful response from India’s commerce minister, Piyush Goyal, who said the two countries are working toward a “fair, balanced and mutually beneficial bilateral trade agreement.” Initially, India’s Foreign Ministry also played down suggestions of any strain. But in a statement late Monday, it called Trump’s criticism “unjustified and unreasonable” and said it will take “all necessary measures to safeguard its national interests and economic security.” It said India began importing oil from Russia because traditional supplies were diverted to Europe after the outbreak of the Ukraine conflict, calling it a “necessity compelled by global market situation.” The statement also noted U.S. trade with Russia. “It is revealing that the very nations criticizing India are themselves indulging in trade with Russia,” the statement said. ___ Associated Press writer Michelle L.

Onsemi’s August Pullback Is a Signal to Buy for Tech Investors,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/onsemis-august-pullback-is-a-signal-to-buy-for-tech-investors/,"Onsemi’s NASDAQ: ON FQ2 results left something to be desired, but do not alter the long-term outlook. The results include sequential growth and a forecast for it to continue, a signal that the bottom of the business contraction has been seen and the recovery is underway. While it may take time for the recovery to gain momentum, Onsemi is well-positioned for long-term growth due to its focus on SiC microchip technology, critical to numerous industries including EV/AV, drones, and the Internet of Things. The takeaway for investors is that the July price pullback aligns with a market bottom, and the discount is unlikely to linger. Onsemi did not have a blowout quarter, with revenue contracting by 15.5% year-over-year (YOY). However, the $1.47 billion in revenue is slightly better than expected and up sequentially, with the YOY contraction slowing sequentially and compared to last year. Improvement was seen in all segments, led by Power Solutions Group (PSG), which returned to growth, expanding by 2% YOY. The Analog and Mixed-Signal Group (AMG) and Intelligent Sensing Group (ISG) segments remain in contraction, but business is improving with AMG down only 2% YOY and the 8% contraction in ISG about half the pace of previous quarters. Margin news is a sticking point for investors in August. The company’s margins contracted significantly due to business deleveraging, but the news is not all bad. The critical takeaway is that the company continues to generate sufficient cash flow and free cash flow (FCF) to sustain its turnaround, financial health, and capital returns while the business turnaround and industry rebound gain momentum. The net result for Q2 is $106.1 million in free cash flow and $0.53 in adjusted earnings, as expected, compared to the modest strength seen in the revenue comparison. The guidance provides the good news and explains why the stock price is expected to rebound later this quarter. The company is not expecting a robust improvement but is guiding for sequential growth, another slowdown in the YOY contraction, and may be cautious in its estimates, forecasting revenue and earnings slightly above the consensus. Onsemi’s capital return consists entirely of share repurchases, which are robust, reducing the count by more than 4% YOY in Q2 and are expected to continue. The company’s cash flow is reduced compared to prior years, but it continues to improve as the year progresses and into next year. It is improving sequentially in 2025 and is forecasted to continue improving in the next fiscal year. Until then, the cash flow is sufficient to sustain the balance sheet health, which includes ample cash and low leverage. The company’s long-term debt is only $3.3 billion, less than 0.5x the equity and about 1.35x the cash. Institutions show high confidence in Onsemi’s ability to continue buying back shares. After selling on balance in Q1, the group, which owns more than 97% of the stock, reverted to buying on balance in Q2 and continued the trend in Q3. With this in place, it is unlikely that Onsemi stock will hit a new low and more likely that it will continue moving sideways within its newly established range, if not complete a reversal and begin moving higher. Analysts' sentiment trends also align with a bottom for Onsemi’s stock price. Although sentiment and the consensus price target have moderated from earlier in the year, the 24 tracked by MarketBeat continue to rate it as a Hold with bullish bias, and recent price target revisions are upward. They have put the bottom in the consensus, lifting it marginally since the start of summer, and put the stock at fair value with a chance of rising 15% to 35% by year’s end.

The S&P 500 rose 1.5% Monday, following its worst day since May. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 1.3%, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 2%. Gains for Tyson Foods and other companies following better-than-expected profit reports helped offset a drop for Berkshire Hathaway. This upcoming week may have fewer fireworks on Wall Street than last week, which was punctuated by a disappointingly weak report on the U.S. job market. That raised worries that President Donald Trump’s tariffs may be punishing the economy. On Monday: The S&P 500 rose 91.93 points, or 1.5%, to 6,329.94. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 585.06 points, or 1.3%, to 44,173.64. The Nasdaq composite rose 403.45 points, or 2%, to 21,053.58.

"Argentina's Milei vetoes pension and disability spending increases, citing fiscal deficit pledge",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/milei-vetoes-pension-and-disability-spending-increases-citing-fiscal-deficit-pledge-2025-08-04/,"BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — Libertarian President Javier Milei on Monday vetoed an attempt to increase spending on pensions in Argentina and a law expanding protections for people with disabilities, saying the legislation would have undermined his flagship pledge to eliminate the country’s chronic fiscal deficit before October’s midterm elections. In publishing the veto decisions, Milei's administration said that Congress last month passed the spending bills — meant to more fully compensate retirees for inflation and offer more financial benefits for people with disabilities — “without determining the source of the funds."" It said the bills “contradicted (Milei’s) popular mandate” to bring down inflation. Since coming to power in late 2023, Milei has vetoed all efforts to boost public spending, often wielding the slogan “there is no money” against people's demands that he restore subsidies. The government projects that the additional expenditures, including a 7.2% pension increase, will amount to about 0.9% of gross domestic product this year and 1.68% next year. “This president prefers to tell an uncomfortable truth rather than repeat comfortable lies: There is no money,"" the government said. Spinning off the slogan of his ally, U.S. President Donald Trump, it added: ""The only way to make Argentina great again is with effort and honesty, not the same old recipes.” Last year Milei racked up Argentina's first annual fiscal surplus in 14 years by making painful cuts to social spending and public works. The austerity measures helped drive down Argentina’s monthly inflation rate to below 2% in June for the first time in five years, compared to more than 25% when Milei entered office in December 2023. But the fiscal shock program has also deepened economic misery for many Argentines: Unemployment has climbed, wages adjusted for inflation have declined and prices are still up 40% year-on-year. Congress can still overturn these vetoes with a two-thirds majority in both chambers, a challenge for Milei’s libertarian party, which holds only a small minority of seats. Milei, whose relationship with lawmakers has been tense ever since he took office, last year managed to win enough votes from his party's closest ally, the conservative PRO bloc, to prevent the pension increases. Milei is looking to Argentina's crucial midterm elections in October to boost his party’s representation as he seeks to continue his fiscal balance drive and draw more foreign investment. The elections are widely seen as a referendum on his two years in office. Retirees have been at the forefront of protests against Milei's government. Every Wednesday now for months, dozens of older Argentines struggling to scrape by on pensions of just $400 a month have faced off against security forces armed with tear gas and water cannons. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america"
In his own words: Trump's comments over the past year on the jobs report,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/in-his-own-words-trumps-comments-over-the-past-year-on-the-jobs-report-2025-08-04/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — In firing the head of the agency that produces monthly jobs figures, President Donald Trump alleged that the recent weaker-than-expected numbers were phony and that positive numbers reported before the 2024 election were manipulated to make him look bad. It’s a familiar cadence Trump has adopted in reacting to jobs reports: He treats the figures as legitimate when they are favorable to him and fraudulent when they are less than stellar or seem to benefit his opponent. A look at some of Trump's observations on jobs reports over the past year: Aug. 5, 2024 “STOCK MARKETS ARE CRASHING, JOBS NUMBERS ARE TERRIBLE, WE ARE HEADING TO WORLD WAR lll, AND WE HAVE TWO OF THE MOST INCOMPETENT ‘LEADERS’ IN HISTORY. THIS IS NOT GOOD!!!” — Trump post on Truth Social Suggesting President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were responsible, Trump was reacting to the news that U.S. employees had added 114,000 jobs in July — 35% fewer than expected — and that the unemployment rate was at its highest level in nearly three years. Nov. 1, 2024 “Today’s jobs report is a great embarrassment for our Nation. Kamala has lied for years about their pathetic job growth, which has never been real. Kamala killed 46,000 manufacturing jobs, while 773,000 Americans have lost employment in just the last year — all while their jobs have been taken by foreign-born workers. America is a Nation in Decline because Sleepy Joe, and Lyin’ Kamala, didn’t do their job. ‘TRUMP’ WILL FIX IT! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! GO VOTE!” — Trump post on Truth Social Days ahead of the presidential election, Trump blasted news that U.S. employers had added just 12,000 jobs in October, a total that economists say had been held down by the effects of strikes and hurricanes that left many workers temporarily off payrolls. Nov. 4, 2024 “Nearly 250,000 people dropped out of the labor force. They dropped out because they couldn’t get a job. Can you imagine that? Can you imagine? These are the numbers, and they don’t want to talk about it, but that’s OK. These numbers are disqualifying.” — Trump campaign rally in Raleigh, North Carolina According to Bureau of Labor Statistics data, around 220,000 people left the civilian U.S. workforce from September to October 2024 during Biden's presidency. April 4, 2025 “GREAT JOB NUMBERS, FAR BETTER THAN EXPECTED. IT’S ALREADY WORKING. HANG TOUGH, WE CAN’T LOSE!!!"" — Trump post on Truth Social Trump quickly praised news that in March, U.S. employers had added a surprising 228,000 jobs, showing that the American labor market was in solid shape as he embarked on a risky trade war with the rest of the world. The hiring numbers were up from 117,000 in February and were nearly double the 130,000 that economists had expected. June 6, 2025 “GREAT JOB NUMBERS, STOCK MARKET UP BIG! AT THE SAME TIME, BILLIONS POURING IN FROM TARIFFS!!!” — Trump post on Truth Social Trump responded enthusiastically to the initial numbers on the May jobs report, which indicated that the economy added 139,000 jobs. That estimate was later revised down to 125,000 jobs, prior to the most recent revision down to just 19,000. Aug. 1, 2025 “I was just informed that our Country’s ‘Jobs Numbers’ are being produced by a Biden Appointee, Dr. Erika McEntarfer, the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, who faked the Jobs Numbers before the Election to try and boost Kamala’s chances of Victory. ... I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY."" — Trump post on Truth Social Trump ousted McEntarfer following a report showed hiring slowed in July and was much weaker in May and June than previously reported, taking issue in subsequent days to the revisions of jobs figures that are a regular occurrence with the monthly reporting. ___ Kinnard can be reached at http://x.com/MegKinnardAP"

Book Review: 'The Devil Reached Toward the Sky' weaves thorough account of Atomic Age's start,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/book-review-the-devil-reached-toward-the-sky-weaves-thorough-account-of-atomic-ages-start-2025-08-04/,"The story of the Atomic Age's start is a fascinating one about the power of invention and a chilling one about its consequences. In “The Devil Reached Toward the Sky: An Oral History of the Making and Unleashing of the Atomic Bomb,” Garrett M. Graff skillfully tells both. The power of Graff's oral history is the diversity of voices he relies upon in crafting a comprehensive history of the atomic bomb's inception, creation and use during World War II. He creates a comprehensive account of a what seems like a well-told piece of history by including voices that have been either little-heard or missed altogether in the six decades since the atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Graff at the outset acknowledges his book is adding to a history that feels well-worn, from historian Richard Rhodes to filmmaker Christopher Nolan. But Graff manages to stand up to even those accounts with voices that help the reader help what it was it was like on the ground. It includes life at Los Alamos, New Mexico; Oak Ridge, Tennessee; and Hanford, Washington as scientists raced to develop the atomic bomb before Nazi Germany. “The Devil Reached Toward the Sky” focuses not just on the voices of scientists like Robert Oppenheimer and Edward Teller. Graff also explores overlooked pieces of the Manhattan Project's history, such as how segregation affected life at Oak Ridge. But the most powerful portions come in the final chapters of the book, which focus on the bombing and the aftereffects of the bombing in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. No writer could describe better the hellscape that the bombs unleashed better than those on the ground who survived it. “My God, what have we done?,” Capt. Robert A. Lewis, co-pilot of the Enola Gay, is quoted in the book as saying. The voices Graff mines help begin to answer at least part of that question. ___ AP book reviews: https://apnews.com/hub/book-reviews"
New Jersey says 3 chemical makers agree to 'forever chemical' settlement worth up to $2 billion,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/new-jersey-says-3-chemical-makers-agree-to-forever-chemical-settlement-worth-up-to-2-billion-2025-08-04/,"TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — DuPont and two other companies will pay New Jersey up to $2 billion to settle environmental claims stemming from PFAS, commonly referred to as “forever chemicals,"" the companies announced Monday. State Environmental Commissioner Shawn LaTourette said the deal with DuPont, Chemours and Corteva is the largest such settlement in the state's history. It calls for the companies to pay $875 million over 25 years and create a remediation fund of up $1.2 billion. The companies will split the costs under the deal, which must still be approved by the courts. PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a group of chemicals that have been around for decades and have now spread into the nation’s air, water and soil. They are commonly referred to as “forever chemicals.” DuPont said the settlement will resolve “all pending environmental and other claims” for ”legacy"" contamination claims at four sites where the companies operated in the state. It comes just months after the state said chemical manufacturer 3M has agreed to pay up $450 million to resolve lawsuits over natural resource contamination stemming from PFAS. ""Polluters who place profit above public well-being by releasing poisonous PFAS and other contamination in our State can expect to be held responsible to clean up their mess and fully compensate the State and its citizens for the precious natural resources they’ve damaged or destroyed,"" LaTourette said. PFAS were manufactured by companies such as 3M, Chemours and others because they were incredibly useful. They helped eggs slide across non-stick frying pans, ensured that firefighting foam suffocates flames and helped clothes withstand rain and keep people dry. The chemicals resist breaking down, though, meaning they linger in the environment. Environmental activists say PFAS makers knew about the health harms of PFAS long before they were made public. The same attributes that make the chemicals so valuable – resistance to breakdown – make them hazardous to people. PFAS accumulate in the body, which is why the Environmental Protection Agency set their limits for drinking water at 4 parts per trillion for two common types — PFOA and PFOS — that are phased out of manufacturing but still are present in the environment."
"In Ecuador, environmentalists worry Noboa is unwinding nation's green reputation",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/in-ecuador-environmentalists-worry-noboa-is-unwinding-nations-green-reputation-2025-08-04/,"BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — When Ecuadorians voted two years ago to block oil drilling in Yasuni National Park, it was a triumph for environmentalists seeking to protect one of the most biodiverse places on Earth. And it was in character for a country that was first to enshrine the “rights of nature” in its constitution and is home to parts of the Amazon rain forest and the Galápagos Islands. But recent moves by President Daniel Noboa have alarmed environmentalists and Indigenous leaders who say the country’s green reputation — and its protections for civil society — are unraveling. Noboa's administration has moved to scrap the country’s independent Environment Ministry. It's pushing legislation ostensibly aimed at choking off illegal mining, but which critics fear will devastate nonprofits. The National Assembly — pressed by Noboa — approved a law last month allowing private and foreign entities to co‑manage conservation zones that critics say weakens protections and threatens Indigenous land rights. And Ecuador just signed a new oil deal with Peru that could accelerate drilling in sensitive areas. Natalia Greene, an environmental advocate with the Global Alliance for the Rights of Nature, said Noboa's decision to fold the Environment Ministry into the Ministry of Energy and Mines will speed up mining just as Ecuador is grappling with a surge in illegal gold mining tied to organized crime. She called it “like putting the wolf in charge of the sheep.” “The government’s intention is very clear — to be a machine gun of extractivism,” she said. Noboa has defended the ministry moves and other changes as necessary to cut costs, reduce bureaucracy and address Ecuador’s financial crisis. Officials argue that consolidating ministries will make decision‑making more efficient. Neither the Ministry of Energy and Mines nor Noboa's office responded to questions from The Associated Press. In July, Peru and Ecuador signed a deal for Ecuador’s state oil company to sell crude directly to Petroperu and link its southern Amazon reserves to Peru’s Norperuano pipeline, with drilling eyed for January 2026. Environmental groups say it could fast‑track drilling in sensitive areas while skirting safeguards and Indigenous consultation. Peru’s Achuar, Wampis and Chapra nations denounced the plan in a public letter, saying it would gut long-standing protections that require communities be consulted before projects move forward on their lands. They warned the pipeline already averages 146 spills a year and that expanding it would be “a grave threat to the Amazon and to Indigenous livelihoods.” “They are going to violate all our rights to enter our territories and extract the resources they want,"" said Nemo Guiquita, a Waorani leader with the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of the Ecuadorian Amazon. She said Indigenous communities fear a surge of oil and mining projects across ancestral lands, threatening both ecosystems and livelihoods. “There will be a weakening of environmental protection,” she said. “There will be a lot of deforestation, contamination of rivers and destruction of the ecosystem, which is vital for our existence as Indigenous peoples.” Ricardo Buitrón, president of the Quito‑based environmental group Accion Ecologica, noted that the changes come just months after Ecuadorians voted to keep oil in the ground in Yasuni, a decision the government has yet to fully enforce. “We have gone back decades,” he said. “A development model is being prioritized that does not care about protecting ecosystems, but about extracting natural resources to the maximum.” The proposed law that has alarmed nonprofits is formally called the Organic Law for the Control of Irregular Capital Flows. But activists call it the “anti-NGO” law, saying it could impose heavy burdens on nonprofits and force many to close. The measure applies to more than 71,000 organizations nationwide, giving them six months to re‑register with the government, submit detailed financial records and disclose foreign funding sources. The government says the law is needed to prevent money laundering and political destabilization. Critics warn it could instead silence dissent by placing organizations under sweeping controls. Noboa submitted the bill to the National Assembly on July 29, giving lawmakers until Aug. 28 to act before it automatically becomes law. “This has been hard for us,” Guiquita said. “Practically, Indigenous organizations live mostly from donations and NGOs. The government is weakening us in every space.” “It represents a threat because they could dissolve us under any pretext,” Buitrón said. “This reminds us of what we already lived through a decade ago, when they tried to shut down some organizations in the country.” Kevin Koenig of Amazon Watch, a U.S.-based nonprofit that advocates for Indigenous rights and environmental protection in the Amazon, said the country’s changes are part of a wider rollback. “We are seeing a sweeping package of regressive reforms that are rolling back environmental protections, Indigenous rights guarantees, and threatening basic civil liberties like the freedom of speech and assembly,” he said. “What it suggests is the massive expansion of oil and mining, particularly in the Amazon region.” Koenig said the changes send troubling signals ahead of COP30, the United Nations climate summit set for Brazil later this year. Similar trends are unfolding in Peru and El Salvador, where governments have limited environmental oversight, and in Brazil, where licensing for Amazon projects has been weakened. Civil society groups are mobilizing against the changes. Greene said organizations have reactivated the Asamblea Nacional Socioambiental, a national coalition of environmental and social movements, and are planning legal challenges, demonstrations and appeals to international bodies. Many fear Ecuador’s role as a global green pioneer is unraveling. “Our only crime here has been protecting our territory, protecting our traditions, protecting our way of life,” Guiquita said. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

AMD Outperforming NVIDIA: What’s Behind It and Can It Continue?,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/amd-outperforming-nvidia-whats-behind-it-and-can-it-continue/,"Earlier this year, NVIDIA Corp. NASDAQ: NVDA became the world’s first $4 trillion company, rising to the top of the Magnificent Seven on the back of a 30% year-to-date (YTD) gain. Few companies have become more synonymous with artificial intelligence than NVIDIA, and investors certainly aren’t crying poor over a 30% gain in just seven months. However, NVIDIA’s stock is no longer leading the pack in the semiconductor sector thanks to a meteoric rise from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. NASDAQ: AMD, whose shares are up more than 45% so far this year and more than 80% in the last three months alone. Today, we’ll discuss why AMD shares have outpaced NVDA so far in 2025 and look for any hints from the market on whether this outperformance can continue. If you’re in the market for Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), there’s a good chance you’re sourcing from NVIDIA, which controls a stunning 92% of the market share for desktop and laptop GPUs, and 80% of the chips used for AI training. AMD GPUs make up most of the remaining 8% of that share, a number that’s dropped from 15% in Q4 2024. But despite NVDA increasing its GPU share lead, its stock has fallen behind AMD’s. One reason for NVDA’s slump in the first half of 2025 was regulatory pressure beyond its control. When President Trump launched his first trade war salvo at China, NVIDIA chips were one of the initial casualties. Export controls banned shipments of the company’s H20 units to China from April until July, resulting in a $4.5 billion excess inventory charge in its Q1 earnings. AMD also received an $800 million excess inventory charge due to export controls, and now Trump has relented, allowing chips to once again flow into China. While NVIDIA took the larger hit since its chips are more specialized and expensive, it's hard to pinpoint regulatory issues as the sole reason for AMD’s outperformance, especially since AMD shares have widened the gap in the last few weeks. If you come at the king, you best not miss, and AMD is deploying a larger product pipeline than NVIDIA to enhance its growth prospects. Tech sector superscalers are naturally wary of becoming too dependent on a single company or product line in their AI projects, and AMD’s MI300 chips quickly achieved $1 billion in sales in just two quarters. In Q1 2025, AMD reported 57% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth in its Data Center segment, primarily through sales of its EPYC server CPUs and Instinct GPUs to AI developers like OpenAI. It also posted 68% YOY growth in its Client segment for laptops and desktops thanks to increased adoption of its Zen 5 chips. AMD is also spending cash on investments and acquisitions. The company paid $4.9 billion to purchase AI infrastructure provider ZT Systems and has also invested in AI startups like Vultr. While NVIDIA isn’t exactly laying low with its Blackwell superchips now in production, it lacks AMD’s pipeline diversity, which could put AMD in a position to reclaim some market share. When NVDA reports earnings, the entire market pays attention. The revenue figures the company reports each quarter continue to defy analysts' expectations. Posting $40 billion in quarterly sales would’ve seemed inconceivable as little as five years ago, and now it’s a number that doesn’t even move the stock after hours. NVDA reported $44.06 billion in quarterly revenue on May 28, which beat expectations by nearly $1 billion and represented 69.2% YOY growth. The data center segment drew $39 billion, a 73% YOY advance and gross margins were 61% even with the $4.5 billion inventory charge. AMD reported $7.44 billion in its Q1 2025 earnings release on May 6, a 36% year-over-year increase. In addition to the data center revenue surge, the struggling Client and Gaming segment also reported 28% year-over-year revenue growth. The company guided a 43% gross margin for its Q2 2025 earnings, which will be released after the market closes on August 5. What do you notice about these numbers? All of these are inferior to NVIDIA’s, from total revenues to growth rates to margins. Despite these numbers, AMD shares are outpacing NVDA’s, which shows how high expectations have gotten for the first $4 trillion company. The first half of 2025 has shown the market that there’s room for two sheriffs in this town. AMD’s outperformance so far is likely a combination of factors: less negative impact from export controls and tariffs, a wider product pipeline, and lower earnings expectations. NVDA’s heavier reliance on Chinese exports could result in future problems should Trump crank up the trade war heat again, a scenario that may presently be priced into both stocks. However, despite the near-impossibly high bar for its earnings, NVIDIA could easily close the gap in Q3 and Q4 if its margins and market share continue to squeeze out the competition. Before you consider Advanced Micro Devices, you'll want to hear this."
3 Surprising Earnings Winners Changing Their Market Narrative,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/3-surprising-earnings-winners-changing-their-market-narrative/,"Who doesn’t love a comeback story? While the most significant stock gains in 2025 have gone to AI hyperscalers, the market has rallied hard off the April lows, and investors are feeling more optimistic despite trade war headwinds and job market uncertainty. Today, we’ll look at three downtrodden individual stocks also mounting comeback stories of their own, and discuss why their Q2 earnings reports point to more improvement ahead. Another earnings season is well underway, and Q2 has been notable for its surprises on both the upside and downside. NVIDIA Corp. NASDAQ: NVDA actually posted an EPS miss, although the $44 billion in revenue was impressive enough to satisfy the ever-increasing demands of analysts and investors. AI hyperscalers like Meta Platforms Inc. NASDAQ: META also continue to raise the bar with record-shattering revenue, but the market could be bifurcating into AI-haves and AI-have-nots. Neil Dutta of Renaissance Macro Research pointed out that AI capex spending (defined as software plus information processing equipment) has added more to U.S. GDP growth so far this year than personal consumption expenditures. If you’re spending on AI and hit your targets, you’ve been rewarded by the market. But if you miss (or even produce a mixed report), you’re getting punished, especially outside the tech sector. Some large-cap stocks that beat expectations saw their stocks still drop after reporting. Coinbase Global Inc. NASDAQ: COIN handily beat EPS estimates, but revenue growth slowed, and the stock was down nearly 14% the next day. Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. NYSE: CMG paired a slight EPS beat with a small revenue miss and was promptly shoved into a locker. The stock fell 13% after the report and another 8% in the week after. Standards are high right now, and even tiny missteps are causing losses. When expectations are this high, there’s no shame in looking for stocks with lower standards. That doesn’t mean lowering your standards as an investor (we’re still doing due diligence with proper risk analysis), it means looking for undervalued stocks that the market is discounting. Stocks like the three we’ll mention below are slowly rebuilding trust from the market and changing the story around their companies following their Q2 earnings releases. All these companies have spent most of the past few years out of favor with their investors. But the sentiment around them is slowly changing, and each reported impressive Q2 earnings to back up that narrative. If you’re looking for value amidst a market that’s rapidly getting overextended, consider these surprising Q2 winners. It’s hard to forget the halcyon days of the meme stock era. Stocks like SoFi Technologies Inc. NASDAQ: SOFI gained and lost 50% multiple times in the span of a few months while CEO Chamath Palihapitiya authored some of the cringiest tweets in the history of social media. You can still get plenty of cringe on Palihapitiya’s Twitter feed today, but the stock is no longer a meme thanks to its surging membership and loan growth. In Q2, SoFi added 850,000 new customers, representing year-over-year (YOY) growth of 34%. Revenue missed analysts' expectations, but also grew 42% YOY, and the 8 cents EPS number beat the expected 6 cents. Loan originations were also up 64% YOY to a record $8.8 billion, and the company raised FY 2025 guidance to $3.37 billion. SoFi stock remains a consensus Hold based on ratings from 20 analysts tracked by MarketBeat. However, the company’s Q2 earnings triggered new activity: Mizuho, Morgan Stanley, and Barclays all updated their coverage following the report—signaling growing attention even amid a neutral consensus. Investors have been watching The Boeing Co. NYSE: BA with binoculars for the last few years as the company made mistake after mistake, rendering the stock practically uninvestable. Recent scandals have plagued Boeing, a once-proud beacon of American industrialism, and its stock remains more than 50% below its 2019 all-time high. However, it's up more than 20% this year and showing signs of a sustained turnaround. In Q2, the company posted an unprofitable quarter (as expected), but it was narrower than a year ago, and the $22.75 billion in revenue represented nearly 35% YOY growth, easily smashing projections. But like most industrial sector stocks, we look to the backlog for clues. Boeing booked 455 orders in Q2, which boosts its backlog total to over $600 billion with more than 5,900 commercial plane orders on the books. Boeing’s future looks brighter right now than it has in more than five years, and investors are taking notice. Another beatdown name from a bygone era, PayPal Holdings Inc. NASDAQ: PYPL has been garnering attention for its turnaround story. The stock is still down 20% this year and plunged again following its Q2 earnings release. But this drop is likely unwarranted and could represent a new entry point for investors. PayPal’s July 29 earnings saw EPS and revenue both beat expectations, led by Venmo’s 20% YOY revenue growth. The company has also demonstrated a shift to allow consumers to more easily interact with merchants by making all five of its participating global wallets (Venmo, PayPal, UPI, Mercado Pago, Tenpay Global) available for paying any PayPal merchant. Analysts are starting to take notice, too; PYPL shares received several price target boosts following its report, and the consensus target is now $84.57, signaling potential upside of over 25%. Before you consider SoFi Technologies, you'll want to hear this."
How 2 Deals in 48 Hours Changed Everything for Joby Aviation,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/how-2-deals-in-48-hours-changed-everything-for-joby-aviation/,"In a powerful display of strategic execution, Joby Aviation NYSE: JOBY has seen its stock launch to all-time highs as investors have decided on the company's future. During the first days of August, shares surged in high-volume sessions, pushing the company’s market capitalization to well over $14 billion on multiple occasions. This rally was driven by the market’s reaction to two transformative announcements made in back-to-back trading sessions. In a deliberate strategic blitz, Joby has delivered a one-two punch, executing one move to fast-track its near-term commercial revenue and another to unlock a massive, long-term defense market. Together, these actions have fundamentally reshaped the company’s growth trajectory and solidified its leadership position in the aerospace sector. On August 4, Joby announced a definitive agreement to acquire the passenger business of Blade Air Mobility NASDAQ: BLDE for up to $125 million. This move is a massive de-risking event that provides a clear and immediate answer to one of the biggest questions facing the company: how will it launch its service at scale? Instead of building a complex commercial operation from scratch over many years, Joby is acquiring a complete, turnkey ecosystem, leapfrogging years of logistical development. This acquisition is a strategic shortcut that provides several key advantages, which were previously seen as major long-term hurdles. This transaction fundamentally accelerates Joby's path to commercialization and profitability. It moves the company from being a pre-revenue technology developer to an operator-in-waiting with the infrastructure, customers, and expertise needed to launch effectively as soon as its aircraft is certified. Just one trading day before the Blade news, on August 1, Joby revealed a major partnership with defense giant L3Harris Technologies NYSE: LHX. The two companies will collaborate to develop a new class of autonomous, gas turbine hybrid VTOL aircraft specifically for military applications, with flight testing expected to begin as early as fall 2025. For investors, this deal's stock implications are profound: It opens a second, massive revenue stream that is entirely independent of the commercial passenger market. This move intelligently diversifies the company’s future. The defense sector represents a significant opportunity with the potential for large, government-funded contracts. This is a source of non-dilutive funding, meaning Joby can fund this development without issuing new stock and reducing the value of existing shares. This partnership efficiently leverages Joby’s existing technology investments. The new aircraft will be based on Joby's core S4 platform and will incorporate the autonomous flight technology the company gained from its 2024 acquisition of Xwing. Furthermore, the partnership with L3Harris, a ""Trusted Disruptor"" in the defense industry, serves as a powerful endorsement of Joby’s technological capabilities and manufacturing potential. This collaboration provides a credible path to a major new market, making Joby a more resilient and diversified long-term investment. The market’s powerful and positive reaction to this 48-hour blitz of news is a logical re-evaluation of the company's worth. With the stock price trading comfortably above $17, it has soared past the consensus analyst price target, which sits below $10. This signals that investors are pricing these transformative developments faster than Wall Street models can be updated. Joby is no longer just a bet on a single technology for a single market; it is now a multi-market platform company with a de-risked commercial path and a credible defense frontier. These two deals completely change the context for the company's upcoming second-quarter earnings call, scheduled for August 6. The conversation will now shift from questions about future hypotheticals to the tangible realities of integrating the Blade operations and executing on the L3Harris partnership. In just two days, Joby provided clear, decisive answers to some of its biggest strategic questions. The market’s verdict is in, and it signals a justified belief that Joby is now positioned to lead on both the commercial and defense fronts of the advanced air mobility revolution.
