Indigenous Wampis are ambushed in Peru after government backs out of anti-mining joint patrol,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/indigenous-wampis-are-ambushed-in-peru-after-government-backs-out-of-anti-mining-joint-patrol-2025-07-16/,"BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — An attack by armed assailants on a patrol of a mission by the Indigenous Wampis guards last week in the Peruvian Amazon has again brought into focus the issue of illegal gold mining in the ancestral territory. The 60-member mission was ambushed and shot at as they were patrolling near the Wampis community of Fortaleza on Saturday, just days after the Peruvian government’s sudden withdrawal from a planned joint enforcement operation to confront the illegal mining. No one was hurt in the attack. For two years, the Wampis Nation has pressed state agencies and the public prosecutor's office in Peru to work together to monitor for and remove illegal mining operations from the Santiago River basin. Days before a scheduled joint operation, government agencies pulled out without explanation, according to Amazon Watch, a U.S.-based environmental and Indigenous rights nonprofit. In response, the Wampis launched their own mission and its first patrol was attacked on Saturday. Indigenous leaders say the incident highlights the growing risks faced by land defenders and the government’s failure to uphold its promises. A Wampis official described the attack to The Associated Press. The around 60 Indigenous leaders, community guards and technicians were tasked with monitoring the environmental impacts of illegal gold mining in the Bajo Rio Santiago region. “People started throwing explosives — I don’t even know what kind they were — and then came the gunfire,” said Evaristo Pujupat Shirap, 45, communications officer for the Autonomous Territorial Government of the Wampis Nation. “Bullets hit the vehicle and even pierced a teacher’s jacket at chest level,” Shirap added. The Peruvian government did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Members on the Wampis mission were armed with hunting rifles, but according to Shirap, leaders had instructed the group not to fire under any circumstances. While they did fire a few warning shots into the air, no direct confrontation took place, Shirap added. “We will not stand by while our rivers are poisoned and our forests destroyed,” said Galois Yampis, vice president of the Wampis government. Peru's ""government failed to honor its commitments, so we are acting to defend our territory and the future of our people,” he added. The Indigenous Wampis territorial guards are community-led environmental defenders trained and organized by the autonomous territorial government of the Wampis Nation. Their aim is to protect Wampis ancestral lands from illegal activities such as mining, logging, and drug trafficking, while upholding their cultural values and vision of Tarimat Pujut — a life in harmony with nature. Raphael Hoetmer, Amazon program director at Amazon Watch, a longtime ally of the Wampis, said they only confront violent criminals — ""yet are left to face danger without state protection.” The Wampis Nation has long been urging Peru and gold-importing nations to strengthen enforcement against illegal gold trade and invest in Indigenous-led territorial monitoring and sustainable development. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

3 Drone Stocks Take Flight on Hegesth's Bold Memo: Who and Why,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/3-drone-stocks-take-flight-on-hegesths-bold-memo-who-and-why/,"Several drone stocks surged on July 11 after the United States Department of Defense (DoD) released a memo with highly bullish implications for the industry. In the memo titled “Unleashing U.S. Military Drone Dominance,"" Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth shared his vision for increased U.S. drone production and use. Let’s dive into some of the specifics of the memo and the defense stocks that were among the biggest beneficiaries. Hegseth says the United States has fallen behind the rest of the world in drone production. Now, to bridge this gap, Hegseth is “rescinding restrictive policies that hindered production."" However, the one-page memo didn’t provide much detail on what is actually changing in U.S. drone policy. Publications like The War Zone reveal that the memo largely focuses on increasing U.S. production of small drones, such as those made by Red Cat NASDAQ: RCAT. Small drones like Red Cat’s Black Widow will now be “accounted for as consumable commodities, not durable property."" This empowers soldiers to use these drones without worrying about whether adversaries will destroy them. By the end of 2026, Hegseth wants to equip every squad with cheap and expendable drones. This shift could lead to big-time sales boosts for Red Cat down the road. In response to this news, Red Cat soared over 26% on July 11 and another 20% on July 14. In 2024, the Black Widow became the winner of the U.S. Army’s Short Range Reconnaissance (SRR) Program of Record, making it the sole drone used by the Army in SRR. Red Cat only recorded around $16.5 million in sales over the last 12 months. Thus, the company has a significant opportunity to grow from that small base. Hegseth’s memo increases the likelihood of this happening. Although the memo is largely focused on small drones, Kratos Defense and Security Solutions NASDAQ: KTOS also saw shares rise nearly 12% on July 11. Kratos makes much larger fighter jet drones, but there are multiple key reasons why the memo is a positive for the firm. Hegseth wants America to “power the technological leapfrog” in drone technology, which lines up with Kratos’ jet drone focus. Additionally, there was an overarching emphasis in the memo on low-cost drones. Kratos has become known for making affordability a central tenet of the technologies it offers. Kratos developed the XQ-58A under the Air Force’s Low-Cost Attritable Aircraft Technology (LCAAT) Initiative. Attritable means that due to its low cost, the military can replace the drone if it is lost in battle. A XQ-58A currently costs between $4 million and $6 million. This is much cheaper than manned jets like Lockheed Martin’s NYSE: LMT F-35 at $80 million to $100 million each. Still, Kratos is working to get the XQ-58A price tag down to $2 million, largely through increased production. When it comes to advanced jet drones, Kratos' focus on affordability makes the company a prime drone jet partner for the U.S. military. Lastly, the memo highlighted the idea that the military should “train as we expect to fight."" By next year, Hegseth wants to see the military train by simulating battles using drones on both sides. Tying into this, Kratos also has a large focus on making target drones, which are used to mimic real fighting. In fact, the company is forecasting between $240 million and $250 million in target drone revenue in 2025. That accounts for more than 80% of its forecasted unmanned systems revenue. Thus, the company could see a big uptick in orders of target drones given the memo’s emphasis on training. Overall, Kratos' focus on technological advancement, affordability, and target drones clearly lines up with Hegseth’s vision, leading to a big rise in shares. AeroVironment NASDAQ: AVAV also gained 11% on July 11. The company makes a variety of drones of different sizes. Only some of its products will shift from the “durable” to the “consumable” classification. Still, the overall push toward expanded U.S. military drone adoption is good for this name. Overall, the Trump administration is clearly taking a more favorable stance on drone warfare. This means the overall pie for this industry will grow bigger, benefiting many players. Still, these firms will fiercely fight to carve out their own niches, making paying attention to changes in the competitive landscape going forward vital for investors. Before you consider Red Cat, you'll want to hear this."

"Faced with geopolitics and trade war, US companies in China report record-low new investment plans",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/faced-with-geopolitics-and-trade-war-us-companies-in-china-report-record-low-new-investment-plans-2025-07-16/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — American companies in China are reporting record-low new investment plans for this year and declining confidence in profits, while uncertainty in U.S.-China relations and President Donald Trump’s tariffs have become their top concerns, according to a business survey released Wednesday. The companies are also challenged by China's slowing economy, where weak domestic demand and overcapacity in local industries are eroding profitability for the Americans. “Businesses in China are less profitable now than they were years ago, but risks, including reputational risk, regulatory risk, and political risk, are increasing,” said Sean Stein, the president of the U.S.-China Business Council, a Washington-based group that represents American companies doing business in China, including major multinationals. The survey, conducted between March and May and drawing from 130 member companies, came after the two countries clashed over tariffs and nontariff measures, including export controls on critical products such as rare-earth magnets and advanced computer chips. Following high-level talks in Geneva and London, U.S. and Chinese officials agreed to pull back from sky-high tariffs and restrictions on exports, but uncertainty persists as the two sides are yet to hammer out a more permanent trade deal. Kyle Sullivan, vice president of business advisory services at the USCBC, said more than half of the companies in the survey indicated they do not have new investment plans in China “at all” this year. ""That’s a record high,” Sullivan said, noting that it is “a new development that we have not observed in previous surveys.” Around 40% of companies reported negative effects from U.S. export control measures, with many experiencing lost sales, severed customer relationships, and reputational damage from being unreliable suppliers, according to the survey. Citing national security, the U.S. government has banned exports to China of high-tech products, such as the most advanced chips, which could help boost China's military capabilities. Stein argued that export controls must be very carefully targeted, because businesses from Europe or Japan, or local businesses in China would immediately fill the void left by American companies. Silicon Valley chipmaker Nvidia won approval from the Trump administration to resume sales to China of its advanced H20 chips used to develop artificial intelligence, its CEO Jensen Huang announced on Monday, though the company's most powerful chips remain under U.S. export control rules. While 82% of U.S. companies reported profits in 2024, fewer than half are optimistic about the future in China, reflecting concerns over tariffs, deflation, and policy uncertainty, according to the survey. Also, a record high number of American businesses plan to relocate their business operations outside of China, Sullivan said, as 27% of the members indicated so, up from 19% the year before. In a departure from past surveys, concerns over China's regulatory environment, including risks of intellectual property misuse and lack of market access, didn’t make it to the top five concerns this year. That's likely a first, and not for a good reason, Stein said. “It is not because things got dramatically better on the Chinese side, but the new challenges, often coming from the U.S., are now posing as much of a challenge,” Stein said. Almost all the American companies said they cannot remain globally competitive without their Chinese operations. A survey from the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China in May found that European companies were cutting costs and scaling back investment plans in China as its economy slows and fierce competition drives down prices."
Trump says he's 'highly unlikely' to fire Fed's Powell after floating that idea in private,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-says-hes-highly-unlikely-to-fire-feds-powell-after-floating-that-idea-in-private-2025-07-16/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he was “highly unlikely” to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, a public statement made less than 24 hours after suggesting in a private meeting that he was leaning in favor of dismissing the head of the nation's central bank. Trump confirmed that in a White House meeting Tuesday night with about a dozen House Republicans he had discussed the “concept” of dismissing Powell, long a target because of his refusal to lower interest rates as Trump wants. “Almost every one of them said I should,” Trump said about the lawmakers who had come to talk to him about crypto legislation. He indicated he was leaning in that direction, according to a White House official. During that session, Trump waved a letter about firing Powell, but a person familiar with the matter said it was essentially a prop drafted by someone else and that the Republican president has not drafted such a letter. Neither source was authorized to publicly discuss the private meeting and they spoke only on condition on anonymity. Trump made his comment about being “highly unlikely” to dismiss Powell — ”unless he has to leave for fraud” — during an Oval Office meeting with Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, the crown prince of Bahrain. In recent days, White House and administration officials have accused Powell of mismanaging a $2.5 billion renovation project at the Fed, adding to months of efforts by Trump try to rid himself of the politically independent central banker. U.S. stocks were shaky as Trump spoke about Powell on Wednesday. The S&P 500's modest gain in the morning became a drop of 0.7% after initial reports that the president may fire the Fed chair. Stocks then trimmed their losses after Trump's later comment. Treasury yields also swiveled in the bond market but remained mostly calm. Those at the White House meeting were among the more far-right lawmakers, including members of the House Freedom Cause whose views are not always shared by other Republicans. In the Senate, Republicans have taken a more guarded approach. Some have backed Powell’s performance at the Fed as they await an inspector general's review of the construction project. In a speech Wednesday, Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said if Powell is dismissed, “you are going to see a pretty immediate response” “If anybody thinks it would be a good idea for the Fed to become another agency in the government subject to the president, they’re making a huge mistake,"" said Tillis, who has announced that he is not running for reelection. Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., said this week that Powell “has done a decent job.” ""I don’t think he’s been perfect,” he said, adding that there have been times they disagreed, but “I do believe that the chairman is calling them like he sees them.” Republicans on the House Financial Services Committee had been scheduled to meet with Powell on Wednesday evening in a gathering set months ago, but it was abruptly canceled due to votes in the House, according to a committee aide granted anonymity to discuss a private meeting. __ AP Business Writer Stan Choe in New York, AP Congressional Correspondent Lisa Mascaro and Associated Press writers Josh Boak and Stephen Groves contributed to this report."
The EU chief unveils a new $2.3 trillion budget. Lawmakers say the math doesn't 'add up',https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/the-eu-chief-unveils-a-new-23-trillion-budget-lawmakers-say-the-math-doesnt-add-up-2025-07-16/,"BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union needs a new budget that would allow it to respond to crises like Russia’s war on Ukraine or climate change, fund railways and energy grids, and protect farmers’ livelihoods, the EU chief said Wednesday while unveiling her proposal totaling 2 trillion euros ($2.3 trillion). European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who heads the EU’s executive branch, said that under her budget plan, spending on defense and space would increase five-fold, while investment in migration and border management would triple. The proposal kicks off two years of wrangling between the 27 member states which fund most of the budget and the European Parliament. The spending package — which runs from 2028 to 2034 — is seen as a statement about Europe’s ambitions in the world. Von der Leyen described her plan for the budget – known as the Multiannual Financial Framework – as “the most ambitious ever proposed.” “It is more strategic, more flexible, more transparent, and we are investing more in our capacity to respond and more in our independence,” she told reporters in Brussels. But in an early sign of the troubles ahead, von der Leyen conceded that even within her own team of policy commissioners — which worked through the night to finalize the proposal – “not everyone was satisfied with the amount.” EU lawmakers who will chaperone the commission’s proposal through parliament over the next year and 2027, and who were briefed on it, said that the budget math doesn't ""add up.” “However you try to package this, what we have is a real-terms investment and spending freeze,” they said in a statement. “It is the status quo, which the Commission has always insisted is not an option.” Part of the numbers confusion is due to von der Leyen's insistence that national contributions to the budget will not increase. Extra funds would be found through “a step change” in the way the commission raises its own money, she said. The EU as a bloc is not allowed to levy its own taxes, but it does earn revenue from things like customs duties and value added tax. The plan now is to get money through the carbon emissions trading system and a new tobacco duty, among other measures. At the same time, the EU must also pay off billions of euros in debt incurred by measures introduced to stop the spread of COVID-19 and to help revive economies after the pandemic. As for security, von der Leyen said 100 billion euros ($116 billion) should be set aside to help Ukraine rebuild from the ravages of the war, now in its fourth year. “We are suggesting 100 billion euros ... to support recovery, resilience, and of course their path to the EU membership,” she said. Outside the commission headquarters, as von der Leyen’s team debated the plan, around 200 farmers gathered and threw boots at the building. “Everybody is talking about security for Europe. Everybody is talking about a stronger Europe. Well ,let me tell you, you can’t get stronger with an empty stomach,” said Lode Ceyssens, head of the Belgian farmers trade union Boerenbond. ___ Associated Press journalist Sylvain Plazy in Brussels contributed to this report."
Super Micro Stock May Benefit as Cooling Demand Takes Off,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/super-micro-stock-may-benefit-as-cooling-demand-takes-off/,"Most companies in the technology sector are now beginning to recognize the importance of having the right footprint and infrastructure in place for their data center capacity. As the demand for artificial intelligence and cloud computing has skyrocketed and continues to rise, this has become an undeniable theme in the industry. For this reason, making the cost of running data centers as efficient as possible will also be a theme that investors won't want to miss, since the success of most of the technology and its infrastructure relies on this achievement. With this in mind, investors can look to one of the leading names in bringing this cost down through its industry-leading liquid cooling system for data centers. That company is Super Micro Computer Inc. NASDAQ: SMCI. This stock has surprised many investors over the past couple of years in terms of volatility and overcoming most (if not all) of the negative media that came its way while driving the stock price lower. Even after a stellar recovery, however, there is still ample room for this name to trend higher. One of the latest technology players to announce its expansion in the data center space is Meta Platforms Inc. NASDAQ: META. Considering the sizable need this behemoth may have for data centers, this could be enough of a tailwind for investors to start building into their potential buying thesis. However, one assumption needs to be made here: Meta will choose Super Micro Computer as its provider of cooling services for these new data centers, especially as the toll these centers take on the energy grid becomes a concern. That being said, investors can judge the likelihood of this happening based on Super Micro Computer's recent price action. Over the past month, this stock has already delivered a net rally of up to 21.7%, which also brings its quarterly run to a very aggressive 66.7%. Since markets are forward-looking, it isn't too far-fetched to believe that the expectation lies in Meta ultimately choosing Super Micro Computer as its efficiency provider in these new data centers. Still, plenty more indicators serve as evidence to support the potential scenario that is playing out. Not only is the price action bullish enough to justify this belief, but another month like this could turn Super Micro Computer stock into the next short squeeze story. A short squeeze is an event in which short sellers are forced to close their positions at a loss, resulting in buying the underlying stock and creating additional buying pressure. Considering that up to 19.4% of Super Micro Computer's short float is held in short positions, ranking up a dollar value of as much as $4.7 billion, most of this balance could be redeemed in buying activity if the stock delivers another double-digit month of upside. If a short squeeze happens, investors will likely notice Super Micro Computer reaching its previous 52-week high of $96.3 per share. Considering that high benchmark, today's price represents only 55% of the 52-week high, falling significantly behind other peers in the industry. That wide gap in performance could allow this potential short squeeze to push Super Micro Computer stock back to such highs, especially if the market is right in its assumption that Meta will contract the company for its new data centers. This will likely happen, since other major players in the data center space, such as NVIDIA Co. NASDAQ: NVDA, have already been working with Super Micro Computer for these services. Considering this potential, there is also one last gauge to believe in this development. Because of the bullish price action and the fundamental developments, some institutional investors decided that this might be the right time to boost their holdings in Super Micro Computer stock, such as the Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio, which raised its stake by 4.7% as of early July 2025. After that new allocation, the group now holds up to $7.9 million in Super Micro Computer stock, a decision that likely underwent a lot of scrutiny and analysis to be justified. Retail investors can take a page out of that book for their own portfolios today. Before you consider Super Micro Computer, you'll want to hear this."
Trump's bid to claw back $9B in foreign aid and public broadcasting funds nears Senate vote,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trumps-bid-to-claw-back-9b-in-foreign-aid-and-public-broadcasting-funds-nears-senate-vote-2025-07-16/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's request to cancel about $9 billion in foreign aid and public broadcasting spending is nearing passage in the Senate, an action that would have a tiny impact on the nation's rising debt but could have major ramifications for future spending fights in Congress. Spending bills generally need bipartisan support to advance in the Senate. But the legislation before the Senate gives Republicans the opportunity to undo some of the previously approved spending without Democratic support. The measure contains Trump's efforts to target the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and roll back some of the humanitarian and economic assistance the U.S. provides internationally. The Trump administration is promising more rescission packages to come if the first effort is successful. Democrats say doing so upends a legislative process that typically requires lawmakers from both parties to work together to fund the nation's priorities. The move to claw back a sliver of federal spending comes after Republicans muscled Trump's big tax and spending cut bill to approval without any Democratic support. The Congressional Budget Office has projected that measure will increase future federal deficits by about $3.3 trillion over the coming decade. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said Republicans were using the president's rescissions request to target “wasteful spending.” “It's a small but important step for fiscal sanity that we all should be able to agree is long overdue,” Thune said as the Senate opened on Wednesday. In opposing the bill, Democrats said Congress was ceding its spending powers to the executive branch with little idea of how the White House Office of Management and Budget would apply the cuts. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York called the legislation a “terrible bill that guts local news, defunds rural radio stations and makes America less safe on the world stage.” The legislation would claw back nearly $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which represents the full amount it’s due to receive during the next two budget years. The White House says the public media system is politically biased and an unnecessary expense. The corporation distributes more than 70% of the money to more than 1,500 locally operated public television and radio stations, with much of the remainder assigned to National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service to support national programming. Some Republicans had expressed worries about how local radio and televisions stations would survive without federal assistance. Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., said he secured a deal from the White House that some funding administered by the Department of the Interior would be repurposed to subsidize Native American public radio stations in about a dozen states. Democrats are not assured by the side agreements. Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., said in some rural areas of his state pubic radio is the most reliable ways to get news and emergency alerts during wildfire season. “These cuts will lead to rural public radio stations laying off staff, reducing programming, or even shutting down entirely,” Kelly said. Kate Riley, president and CEO of America's Public Television Stations, a network of locally owned and operated stations, said the side deal was “at best a short-term, half-measure that will still result in cuts and reduced service at the stations it purports to save, while leaving behind all other stations, including many that serve Native populations.” The legislation would also claw back about $8 billion in foreign aid spending. Among the cuts are $800 million for a program that provides emergency shelter, water and sanitation and family reunification for those who flee their own country and $496 million to provide food, water and health care for countries hit by natural disasters and conflicts. There's also a $4.15 billion cut for programs that aim to boost the economies and democratic institutions in developing countries. Republicans said they winnowed the president’s request by taking out his proposed $400 million cut to a program known as PEPFAR. The politically popular program is credited with saving millions of lives since its creation under then-President George W. Bush, a Republican, to combat HIV/AIDS. Democrats said the changes to save PEPFAR funding were not enough. They argued that the Trump administration's animus toward foreign aid programs would hurt America's standing in the world and create a vacuum for China to fill. Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, said the amount of money it takes to save a starving child or prevent the transmission of disease is miniscule, even as the investments secure cooperation with the U.S. on other issues. The cuts being made to foreign aid programs through Trump's Department of Government Efficiency were having life-and-death consequences around the world, he said. “People are dying right now, not in spite of us but because of us,” Schatz said. “We are causing death.” Republicans providing just enough votes to take up the bill, with Vice President JD Vance breaking a 50-50 tie on Tuesday night. Three Republicans joined with Democrats in voting against advancing the measure. That sets up on Wednesday what's known as a vote-a-rama, in which lawmakers will vote on scores of proposed amendments to the bill. Once the amendment process is over, the Senate will vote on final passage. During the amendment votes, Democrats sought to remove a variety of the proposed rescissions. The first proposed but ultimately unsuccessful amendment came from Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., who sought to remove the $496 million cut for countries hit by natural disasters. Coons said the money just doesn't save lives but also “strengthens our standing, brings us closer to our allies and helps us compete with China.” Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo., argued many foreign governments and U.N. agencies ""have become reliant on U.S. emergency funding, using it to avoid investing in their own disaster preparedness.” He said even with the rescission, $6 billion would still be available for responding to emergencies around the world. The House has already shown its support for the president’s request with a mostly party line 214-212 vote, but since the Senate is amending the bill, it will have to go back to the House for another vote. The bill must be signed into law by midnight Friday for the proposed rescissions to kick in. If Congress doesn't act by then, the spending stands."
AMD Just Triggered a Signal Traders Can’t Ignore,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/amd-just-triggered-a-signal-traders-cant-ignore/,"Advanced Micro Devices' NASDAQ: AMD price action provided a clear signal that it would move higher in 2025 when it broke fresh highs in July. The move to new highs took the market above a critical resistance point that had been in place for more than a year, setting it up to continue rallying as the year progresses. The real question is how high the market can go now that fresh highs have been set and what will drive it there. The answer to the first question is based on both the technical setup and analyst sentiment trends. In contrast, the second includes results, forecasts, and, once again, analyst sentiment trends, along with a hint of FOMO. The stock price targets for Advanced Micro Devices are based on the movement that preceded the breakout, including near-term, short-term, and long-term targets. The near-term target is based on the near-term price movement, specifically the July rally, which is worth $10. AMD’s stock price has already achieved this target, rising by $10 from the critical resistance point to hit 155 in mid-July. The short-term and long-term targets are more interesting. They are based on stock price movements, which began in April 2025 and October 2022. They are worth $90 and $55, respectively, representing substantial gains relative to the critical resistance. Those targets are near $200 and $235, worth 37% and 60% when reached. AMD’s stock price action is being driven by analysts lifting sentiment and price targets after a wait-and-see period. The hopes priced into AMD’s 2023/2024 stock price surge are now being realized, leaving the stock undervalued due to the 2024/2025 price correction, and the rebound will likely be robust. The critical factor is that AMD’s acquisitions, technological advantages, and upcoming MI400 series have it well-positioned to deliver rack-scale AI semiconductor solutions at scale, provide AI infrastructure to hyperscalers globally, and begin taking a significant market share from NVIDIA NASDAQ: NVDA. The analysts' sentiment trends are robust, leading into the FQ2 earnings report. They include a significant increase in coverage, up 30% in under 12 months to 38, firming sentiment with a strongly bullish bias, and an increasing price target. The sentiment is pegged at a solid Moderate Buy; the bias is due to the high number of Buy and Strong Buy ratings, which account for 73% and 13% of the total, respectively. The consensus price reported by MarketBeat lags the price action in mid-July but preceding 30 days, reflecting a shift in sentiment. Recent revisions have led it up 10% to the $200 to $270 range. Q2 results will likely be a catalyst for AMD’s stock price, given the strength seen in previous quarters and the return of China sales. The resumption of sales to China means that written-off inventory can be recognized, and sales and earnings guidance will likely be much stronger than the current forecast estimate. The consensus is for a sequential decline, with year-over-year growth slowing to only 27%, which is unlikely given the current trends in the AI industry. Institutional trends are another factor supporting this market, aligning with the forecast for a higher share price. They bought on balance in Q1 and Q2 2025 and have extended the trend into the first weeks of Q3, buying at a robust pace of nearly 3-to-1 on a dollar basis. The takeaway is that positive sentiment trends, including analyst coverage, will likely continue through the year’s end. The likelihood of strong performance and guidance also raises the possibility of FOMO, or the fear of missing out, which can lead to a rapid and self-sustaining influx of capital into this market. Before you consider Advanced Micro Devices, you'll want to hear this."
Rocket Lab Gets New Street-High Price Target from Citi,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/rocket-lab-gets-new-street-high-price-target-from-citi/,"Rocket Lab USA NASDAQ: RKLB defies gravity, literally and figuratively. Already one of 2025’s hottest stocks, Rocket Lab is now up over 75% year-to-date and has exploded more than 730% over the past twelve months. And if recent analyst sentiment is any indication, the rally may be far from over. This week, Citigroup delivered yet another bullish catalyst for the space and defense company, raising its price target on RKLB to a new Street-high of $50, up from $33. The firm also reiterated a Buy rating, citing Rocket Lab’s growing commercial pipeline, expanding government contracts, and substantial revenue potential over the next several years. Citi's latest note makes a compelling case for RKLB’s upside. The analysts project as much as $2.6 billion in revenue over the next four years, driven by an estimated 20 Neutron launches and new satellite construction deals tied to U.S. government programs. The firm emphasized the strength of Rocket Lab’s positioning across its launch services and satellite systems businesses, which now form a vertically integrated space platform few competitors can match. This bullish outlook adds fuel to a fire already stoked by accelerating momentum. Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket development continues to progress, and with its inaugural launch still expected by the end of the year, investor anticipation is mounting. Neutron, Rocket Lab’s answer to SpaceX’s Falcon 9, is designed as a reusable, medium-lift rocket, which would open the company to a significantly larger addressable market. Rocket Lab has firmly established itself as a sector leader, evolving from a small satellite launch company into a full-stack space and defense contractor. Its Electron rocket remains one of the world's most reliable small launch vehicles, with 68 successful missions under its belt. However, the company’s ambitions clearly extend well beyond the launchpad. In recent months, RKLB has secured a series of high-profile contracts, including multimillion-dollar deals with the U.S. Space Development Agency and a key European Union mission. These wins validate its growing relevance in global defense and national security infrastructure. Coupled with strategic acquisitions, such as GEOST, which brings space-based sensing and payload capabilities in-house, Rocket Lab is positioning itself as a go-to partner for both government and commercial missions. While fundamentals continue strengthening, the stock’s technical picture reflects bullish sentiment. RKLB is currently trading near all-time highs, with momentum firmly to the upside. Tuesday’s close left the stock’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 81, well into overbought territory. For investors sitting on the sidelines, this could signal that a near-term pullback is possible before the next leg of the upward trend. Key technical support levels to watch include $40 and $35, both prior breakout zones that may serve as attractive entry points if the stock cools off. Still, for longer-term investors who believe in Rocket Lab’s growth story, trying to time the perfect entry may not be necessary. The company’s strategic progress, improving execution, and rapidly expanding revenue base suggest that any dips could be buying opportunities within a broader uptrend. Rocket Lab’s meteoric rise is no longer going unnoticed. What was once a lesser-known player in the space industry quickly became a household name among institutional investors and retail traders. With Neutron development heating up, satellites rolling off the line, and Wall Street analysts increasingly bullish, RKLB’s transformation into a mainstream growth story is underway. And if Citi’s new $50 price target proves accurate, there’s still meaningful upside from here. Before you consider Rocket Lab, you'll want to hear this."
"Cambodia makes 1,000 arrests in latest crackdown on cybercrime",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/cambodia-makes-1000-arrests-in-latest-crackdown-on-cybercrime-2025-07-16/,"PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) — Cambodia on Wednesday said that an order by Prime Minister Hun Manet for government bodies to crackdown on criminal cybercrime operations being run in the country had resulted in the arrest of more than 1,000 suspects so far this week. Hun Manet issued the order authorising state action for “maintaining and protecting security, public order, and social safety.” “The government has observed that online scams are currently causing threats and insecurity in the world and the region. In Cambodia, foreign criminal groups have also infiltrated to engage in online scams,” Hun Manet’s statement, dated Tuesday, said. The United Nations and other agencies estimate that cyberscams, most of them originating from Southeast Asia, earn international criminal gangs billions of dollars annually. More than 1,000 suspects were arrested in raids in at least five provinces between Monday and Wednesday, according to statements from Information Minister Neth Pheaktra and police. Those detained included more than 200 Vietnamese, 27 Chinese, and 75 suspects from Taiwan and 85 Cambodians in the capital Phnom Penh and the southern city of Sihanoukville. Police also seized equipment, including computers and hundreds of mobile phones. At least 270 Indonesians, including 45 women, were arrested Wednesday in Poipet, a town on the border with Thailand notorious for cyberscam and gambling operations, the minister said. Elsewhere, police in the northeastern province of Kratie arrested 312 people, including nationals of Thailand, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Myanmar and Vietnam, while 27 people from Vietnam, China and Myanmar were arrested in the western province of Pursat. Amnesty International last month published the findings of an 18-month investigation into cybercrime in Cambodia, which the human rights group said “point towards state complicity in abuses carried out by Chinese criminal gangs.” “The Cambodian government is deliberately ignoring a litany of human rights abuses including slavery, human trafficking, child labor and torture being carried out by criminal gangs on a vast scale in more than 50 scamming compounds located across the country,” it said. Human trafficking is closely associated with cyberscam operations, as workers are often recruited under false pretences and then held captive. “Deceived, trafficked and enslaved, the survivors of these scamming compounds describe being trapped in a living nightmare – enlisted in criminal enterprises that are operating with the apparent consent of the Cambodian government,” Amnesty International’s Secretary General Agnes Callamard said. Cambodia's latest crackdown comes in the midst of a bitter feud with neighboring Thailand, which began with a brief armed skirmish in late May over border territory claimed by both nations and has now led to border closures and nearly daily exchanges of nationalistic insults. Friendly former leaders of both countries have become estranged and there have been hot debates over which nation’s cultural heritage has influenced the other. Measures initiated by the Thai side, including cutting off cross-border electricity supplies and closing crossing points, have particularly heightened tensions, with Cambodia claiming they were churlish actions of spite to retaliate for its intention to pursue its territorial claims. Thailand said its original intention was to combat long-existing cyberscam operations in Poipet. ——— Associated Press writer Grant Peck in Bangkok contributed to this report."
The online gunseller with Donald Trump Jr. on its board makes its market debut. Shares plunge,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/the-online-gunseller-with-donald-trump-jr-on-its-board-makes-its-market-debut-shares-plunge-2025-07-16/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Online firearms seller GrabAGun Digital Holdings, with the stock ticker “PEW,” made its market debut on Wednesday after board member and son of the U.S. president, Donald Trump Jr., rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of GrabAGun spiked, and then plunged 21% in midday trading. GrabAGun, which also sells ammunition and firearm accessories on its website, went public through a merger with special acquisition company (SPAC) Colombier Acquisition Corp. The Palm Beach, Florida, company said the transaction netted it more than $119 million, which GrabAGun said will be used for working capital and “other purposes to accelerate the company's future growth.” Special acquisition companies, sometimes called “blank check"" companies, can give startups quicker and easier routes to getting their shares trading publicly, while avoiding the traditional scrutiny that comes with a more standard IPO. Corporate interest in having Trump Jr. as a member of the board accelerated upon his father's victory in the U.S. presidential election. Trump Jr. had been named to one board seat between 2020 and 2025, and that was his father's Trump Media & Technology Group in 2022. Since Election Day in November 2024, Trump Jr. has been named to the board of directors at five companies, including GrabAGun. There are clear benefits that come with the name. Trump Jr. was named to the board of drone maker Unusual Machines in the same month that his father was elected. Shares in the company tripled in the days after the announcement. Shares of the so-called “anti-woke” online marketplace PSQ Holdings, doing business as PublicSquare, more than tripled after it named Trump Jr. to its board in early December. In February, the financial advisory firm Dominari Holdings named Trump Jr. and his brother Eric Trump to an advisory board, sending its shares from around $3 to $13 in a matter of days."
"Labubu not the first toy craze, and certainly won't be the last",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/labubu-not-the-first-toy-craze-and-certainly-wont-be-the-last-2025-07-16/,"Pop Mart has struck it rich. The Chinese company that caters to toy connoisseurs and influencers said this week that it expects profit for the first six months of this year to jump by at least 350% compared with the prior-year period, largely because of its smash hit plush toy, the Labubu. Pop Mart joins a small list of companies that have tapped into the zeitgeist, drawing in millions of buyers who, for one reason or another, simply must get their hands on a toy or gadget of the moment. But what makes the Labubu a must-have, or any toy for that matter, is a decades-old question that toy makers have yet to figure out. Here's a look at some of the most popular toys over the years. Cabbage Patch Kids began as chubby-faced dolls with yarn hair that came with adoption papers. During the 1980s the dolls were so popular that parents waited in long lines at stores trying to get a hold of them. More than 90 million Cabbage Patch Kids were sold worldwide during their heyday. Cabbage Patch Kids, which were created by Xavier Roberts and initially sold by Coleco, were relaunched in 2004, looking to take part in the successful return of other popular 1980s toys including Strawberry Shortcake, Care Bears and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. A Cabbage Patch Kid museum named BabyLand General Hospital still exists in Cleveland, Georgia. The dolls entered the National Toy Hall of Fame in 2023. Beanie Babies captivated consumers in the mid-1990s. The cuddly $5 toys were under-stuffed for maximum hug-ability, stamped with cute names on their Ty Inc. tags, and given limited edition runs. Many people collected, traded and sold the toys with the hopes that their value would just keep going up at the dawn of the e-commerce age. It made some people money, and the founder, Ty Warner, a billionaire in three years. In 2014 Warner learned that he would not go to prison for hiding at least $25 million from U.S. tax authorities and instead received two years' probation. Warner, one of the highest profile figures snared in a federal investigation of Americans using Swiss bank accounts to avoid U.S. taxes, had pleaded guilty to a single count of tax evasion. Looking for a pet without the real-life responsibilities? Well then the Tamagotchi electronic pet from Bandai was for you. Consumers were hooked on the egg-shaped plastic toy that first launched in Japan in 1996 and became a craze worldwide in the late 1990s and 2000s. Users were tasked with taking care of their virtual pet by pressing buttons that simulate feeding, disciplining and playing with the critter on screen. If a Tamagotchi is neglected, it dies. In 2013 Tamagotchi was reborn as a mobile app, duplicating the experience of the plastic handheld toy. The toy was inducted into the World Video Game Hall of Fame in May. Fidget spinners — the 3-inch twirling gadgets that took over classrooms and cubicles — were all the rage in 2017. The toy was considered somewhat of an outlier at the time, given that it wasn't made by a major company, timed for the holiday season, or promoted in TV commercials. Fidget spinners were more easily found at gas stations or 7-Eleven than at big toy chains. Fidget spinners had been around for years, mostly used by kids with autism or attention disorders to help them concentrate, but they became more popular after being featured on social media. While hot toys are often made by one company, fidget spinners were made by numerous manufacturers, mostly in China. The toys were marketed as a concentration aid but became so popular among children that many schools started banning them, saying that they were a distraction. The Labubu, by artist and illustrator Kasing Lung, first appeared as monsters with pointed ears and pointy teeth in three picture books inspired by Nordic mythology in 2015. In 2019 Lung struck a deal with Pop Mart, a company that caters to toy connoisseurs and influencers, to sell Labubu figurines. But it wasn’t until Pop Mart started selling Labubu plush toys on key rings in 2023 that the toothy monsters suddenly seemed to be everywhere, including in the hands of Rihanna, Kim Kardashian and NBA star Dillon Brooks. K-pop singer Lisa of Blackpink began posting images of hers for her more than 100 million followers on Instagram and on TikTok, where Labubu pandemonium has broken out. Labubu has been a bonanza for Pop Mart. Its revenue more than doubled in 2024 to 13.04 billion yuan ($1.81 billion), thanks in part to its elvish monster. Revenue from Pop Mart’s plush toys soared more than 1,200% in 2024, nearly 22% of its overall revenue, according to the company’s annual report."
This ASML Dip Could Be Gone Before You Know It—Don’t Miss Out,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/this-asml-dip-could-be-gone-before-you-know-itdont-miss-out/,"ASML Holdings' NASDAQ: ASML stock price plunged more than 8% in pre-market trading following the release of its Q2 earnings, opening up a buying opportunity that is unlikely to last long. The dip was caused by the guidance, specifically for F2026, which is still two reporting periods away. The company didn’t even provide bad guidance; instead, it offered uncertainty in the form of no guidance, citing macroeconomic headwinds and the concerns they bring to the semiconductor industry. Until then, the Q2 report and guidance for Q3 and F2025 give no reason for investors to sell and every reason to believe the business will remain strong in 2026. Further, the capital return remains solid, providing incentive for investors and a tailwind for the price action. ASML reported solid Q2 outperformance on the top and bottom lines relative to consensus figures, per MarketBeat. The company’s $8.92 billion (converted from Euros) in revenue is up 23% compared to last year and outperformed the consensus by 200 basis points, driven by strength in new technology. The number of units sold fell compared to last year, but was offset by price differentials, resulting in a significant margin gain. CEO Christophe Fouquet noted the strength in DRAM markets, which are critical to AI due to HBM memory solutions, as well as the adoption of next-generation EUV lithography technology. Margin is an area of strength that investors should not ignore. ASML’s price/mix resulted in significant outperformance on the bottom line, with the $6.84 in reported GAAP earnings nearly 90 cents, or 1,500 basis points, better than expected. Regarding the guidance, the company issued the first look at Q3 expectations and narrowed the target range for the full year, providing a favorable outlook that expects momentum to continue. ASML’s balance sheet reflects the impacts of property investments and aggressive buybacks but remains solid overall. The reduction in cash and current assets is offset by increased property and total assets and reduced liabilities, and leverage remains very low. The balance sheet is net cash, with long-term debt running approximately 0.2x the equity. This leaves the business in a nimble financial position that can sustain capital returns over the long term. They include the dividend, which yields approximately 0.85% in mid-July, and share buybacks, which reduced the count by an average of 1.3% in Q2. The analyst and institutional trends support the price action in ASML stock this year. Institutions own less than 50% of the stock but are buying on balance while analyst sentiment is firm. MarketBeat's data shows that 12 analysts currently rate the stock with a consistent and firm Moderate Buy rating, and they have recently raised their price targets. The recent revisions align with the consensus forecast for a 12% upside from the pre-release closing price and nearly 20% from the post-release opening. The question is whether ASML's market will support the stock near the cluster of moving averages in the $750 range or if its price falls below them. A move below $750 increases the potential for a significantly deeper pullback, which could take this market to $650 or lower before it reaches a solid bottom. There is a risk that ASML will enter a trading range in this scenario, potentially moving sideways until early 2026, when more clarity is provided. Short interest is also a concern. Still low below 1% of the float, the interest has been increasing in recent months and presents a headwind for the market. Before you consider ASML, you'll want to hear this."
Salesforce Stock Set for 30% Upside to Reach New Highs,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/salesforce-stock-set-for-30-upside-to-reach-new-highs/,"If you are wondering whether Salesforce NYSE: CRM can hit new highs this year, it can, at least according to what the analysts are saying. Their activity capped gains following the FQ1 release but has set this market up to rebound strongly, if not following the FQ2 release, then by the end of the fiscal year. The primary takeaway from the analysts' activity is that sentiment firmed around the solid Moderate Buy rating and expectation for a 30% upside. The 30% upside aligns with the highs, and the high-end range of targets is a new high. The reason the stock price will move into the high-end range is that recent price increases are underappreciated by the market, serving as a driver for acceleration and sustained strength. Among the more bullish recent analyst updates is a reaffirmed Overweight rating and a $404 price target from Morgan Stanley. Analysts at the firm believe the price increases are underappreciated because of their long-term impact on client acquisition, upgrades, and revenue durability. The price increases create a significant discount for tiered bundles compared to piecemeal services, ranging from 70% to 100% in some cases. They are forecasted to accelerate acquisitions and client penetration of technology. Upsell and cross-selling opportunities were also noted as significant, long-term drivers for growth. Bank of America echoed the Morgan Stanley forecast. Analysts at that firm took a deeper look at Salesforce’s primary business, Service Cloud, and see its growth accelerating in the coming quarters. In their view, the cyclical growth slowdown experienced over the last few years is coming to an end, and growth will soon begin to accelerate, reaching 9% by the end of the year and 12% in the longer term. They also reiterated an Overweight equivalent rating and a $350 price target, aligning with the broad market consensus. Salesforce is expected to begin accelerating its growth as soon as the current quarter. The analysts' consensus, as reported by MarketBeat, forecasts 8.7% revenue growth, up from the 7.6% reported in the previous quarter and 8.4% in the same period last year. The bar is set high with 88% of the 42 analysts lifting their estimates over the quarter, but outperformance is still possible. The company revealed bullish momentum in Q1, outperforming the consensus estimate, with remaining performance obligation (RPO) up 12%, and other leading indicators pointing to acceleration. The guidance will be the critical factor. The company needs to initiate a strong third quarter, with the full year reflecting improving momentum. The consensus is for revenue growth to continue accelerating at a marginal pace, resulting in a near -9% this year and a slightly hotter pace in 2026. Institutions own a solid 80% of Salesforce stock and provide a strong tailwind for market action, buying on balance in 2025, including the first weeks of Q3. Among the reasons is the company’s cash flow, balance sheet, and capital return, which are sustainable and expected to increase over time. The capital return includes a token dividend yielding approximately 0.65% as of mid-July and share repurchases that substantially reduce each quarter's count. The buyback activity in Q1 reduced the count by an average of 1.5%, a pace expected to be sustained through the year’s end. The price action in CRM shares isn’t robust but aligns with a long-term uptrend and shows potential for upward movement. The uptrend is marked by the 150-week EMA, which is rising and pointing higher; there are signs of support and potential for a rebound in the price action in 2025 and in the technical indicators. The MACD and stochastic align with a strong support level and are set up to fire converging buy signals, provided a positive catalyst emerges. Before you consider Salesforce, you'll want to hear this."
Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg expected to testify in $8 billion Facebook privacy lawsuit,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/meta-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-expected-to-testify-in-8-billion-facebook-privacy-lawsuit-2025-07-16/,"WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — A $8 billion class action investors’ lawsuit against Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and company leaders — current and former — begins Wednesday, with claims stemming from the 2018 privacy scandal involving the Cambridge Analytica political consulting firm. Investors allege in their lawsuit that Meta did not fully disclose the risks that Facebook users’ personal information would be misused by Cambridge Analytica, a firm that supported Donald Trump’s successful Republican presidential campaign in 2016. Shareholders say Facebook officials repeatedly and continually violated a 2012 consent order with the Federal Trade Commission under which Facebook agreed to stop collecting and sharing personal data on platform users and friends without their consent. Facebook later sold user data to commercial partners in direct violation of the consent order and removed disclosures from privacy settings that were required under consent order, the lawsuit alleges. The fallout led to Facebook agreeing to pay a $5.1 billion penalty to settle FTC charges. The social media giant also faced significant fines in Europe and reached a $725 million privacy settlement with users. Now shareholders want Zuckerberg and others to reimburse Meta for the FTC fine and other legal costs, which the plaintiffs estimate total more than $8 billion. The first trial witness, privacy expert Neil Richards, testified Monday morning for the shareholders. “Facebook’s privacy disclosures were misleading,” said Richards, a professor at Washington University Law School. On cross-examination by a lawyer for the board of directors, he said he could not say whether the company had violated a 2012 consent order with the FTC. However, when asked about a PricewaterhouseCoopers report published in 2015 that found Facebook’s privacy controls to be sufficient, Richards called such reviews “of limited value” because they are based on information provided by the firm itself. The eight-day case will feature testimony from Zuckerberg and former Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg. Others expected to appear on the stand include board member Marc Andreessen and former board member Peter Thiel. It takes place in Delaware Chancery Court, where Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. is incorporated. A judge is expected to rule in the months after the trial wraps up. Meta took the case all the way to the Supreme Court to try to get it dismissed. Justices heard arguments in November and decided that it was wrong to take up the case in the first place. The high court dismissed the company’s appeal, leaving in place an appellate ruling allowing the case to go forward. — Ortutay reported from San Francisco."
