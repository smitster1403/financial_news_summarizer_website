"JK Paper, TNPL, other paper stocks rise up to 17% as Centre sets minimum price on import of packaging material",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/jk-paper-tnpl-other-paper-stocks-rise-up-to-17-as-centre-sets-minimum-price-on-import-of-packaging-material-13484163.html,"Shares of paper companies surged up to 17 percent in early trade on August 25 after the government imposed a Minimum Import Price (MIP) on Virgin Multi-layer Paper Board (VMPB), a move aimed at curbing cheaper imports. Tamilnadu Newsprint and Papers Ltd (TNPL) led the rally, building on early gains to climb by 17 percent to an intraday high of Rs 179.90 on the NSE after two consecutive sessions of decline. JK Paper also advanced sharply, rising 15 percent after four days of losses. West Coast Paper Mills jumped 13.71 percent, while Orient Paper and Industries rose 8.16 percent. Malu Paper Mills and Andhra Paper also gained up to 12 percent in early trade. The Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), in a notification, had said that the MIP will remain in force till March 31, 2026. By fixing a floor price for imports, Centre has effectively made cheap foreign supplies costlier, providing relief to domestic producers. Paper companies in India have long complained of competition from low-priced imports, particularly from Indonesia and China. The Indian Paper Manufacturers Association had in June sought an anti-dumping probe against imports of VMPB from Indonesia. Virgin Multi-layer Paper Board is widely used in packaging for pharmaceuticals, FMCG, food and beverages, electronics, cosmetics, liquor, and also in publishing. By fixing a minimum import price, the government has made cheap imports costlier. This protects local companies, as importers either have to pay more for imported paper board or buy from Indian producers. As a result, domestic demand is expected to shift towards Indian paper companies.

"Nazara Tech shares fall 11% to hit 3-month low, Delta Corp down 2% as online gaming bill becomes law",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/nazara-tech-shares-fall-11-to-hit-3-month-low-delta-corp-down-2-as-online-gaming-bill-becomes-law-13484359.html,"The shares of gaming companies extended significant losses on August 25 after President Droupadi Murmu gave her assent to the Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Bill, 2025, officially making it a law in India. Nazara Technologies shares tumbled over 11 percent to trade at Rs 1,026.70 apiece in the morning. Notably, this is the lowest level seen by the stock in over three months. The gaming stock has so far fallen over 26 percent in the past five days, and currently has a P/E ratio of nearly 95. Delta Corp shares meanwhile dropped around 2 percent to trade at Rs 86.29 apiece. The stock has dropped nearly 6 percent in the past six months, and is down around 23 percent in 2025 so far. The new law prohibits online money games where a user makes a deposit, directly or indirectly, with the expectation of earning winnings on that deposit. Analysts expect that the immediate fallout of the new law would be job losses, the collapse of start-ups, and a sharp drop in foreign and domestic investment. The move threatens to wipe out around 2 lakh jobs, Rs 25,000 crore in foreign direct investment, and Rs 20,000 crore in tax revenues, they say. The move is set to give a blow to the country's $3.8 billion gaming industry that has drawn the attention of global investors and fostered fantasy sports apps like Dream11, Games24X7 and Mobile Premier League. The law includes an imprisonment of up to three years and/or a fine of up to Rs 1 crore. It also includes a provision where repeated offences could attract 3-5 years imprisonment and fines up to Rs 2 crore. The proposed legislation also recommends a regulator for e-sports, educational platforms, and social games. Minister for Electronics and Information Technology Ashwini Vaishnaw while tabling the bill in Rajya Sabha termed online money games as a 'public health risk"". ""There are addiction and withdrawal symptoms. Many families have been destroyed,"" Vaishnaw said. The minister also said that around 45 crore people have been affected, and around Rs 20,000 crore have been lost because of online money games. Nazara Tech said on August 22 its associate firm, Moonshine Technologies, which operates PokerBaazi and other card-based platforms, has ceased offering online games played with money. Ananay Jain, Partner, Grant Thornton Bharat said that the blanket restrictions on certain real-money games may stifle segments of the gaming market that were previously generating significant revenue, particularly in mobile gaming and tournament-based platforms. ""Smaller start-ups and emerging developers may face compliance burdens and financial strain due to penalties and regulatory requirements."" Several real-money gaming (RMG) companies are likely to file writ petitions, as early as possible this week, in 2-3 high courts of the country against the contentious online-gaming Act passed by the Parliament on Thursday, three people directly aware of the matter told Moneycontrol. Sources say, the companies are having consultations currently to decide whether to file petitions individually or through federations, in order to seek a stay on the implementation of the 'Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Bill, 2025'.

"Real estate, metal stocks rise up to 5% amid rising US Fed rate cut hopes after Powell's speech",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/real-estate-metal-stocks-rise-up-to-5-amid-rising-us-fed-rate-cut-hopes-after-powell-s-speech-13484093.html,"The shares of real estate and metal companies recorded sharp gains on August 25 as market expectations for US Federal Reserve's rate cut increased after Chair Jerome Powell's remarks at the Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium. The rise in the share prices pushed the Nifty Realty index up nearly 1 percent to hover around 918 in the early trading hours of Monday, while Nifty Metal index rose over 1 percent to stand at 9,477, snapping a two-day losing streak. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on August 22 said that the weak job market may soon force the American central bank to cut interest rates. ""Downside risks to employment are rising,"" according to Powell's prepared remarks at the Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium. He added that ""the effects of tariffs on consumer prices are now clearly visible"" with high uncertainty in the coming months. Most investors now expect a 25-basis-point Fed rate cut next month. ""Fed chief Powell's remark at Jackson Hole that 'there is a downside risk to unemployment and shifting risk balance may warrant policy adjustment' clearly indicates a rate cut in September,"" said VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited. A rate cut in the US could reduce borrowing costs for foreign investors, encouraging them to invest in higher growth markets in India. This boosts real estate and metal stocks. Additionally, investors expect the RBI to follow Fed in the pursuit of a rate cut, if any. This too can positively impact the stocks. Jindal Stainless Steel was the top gainer on the Nifty Metal index, rising nearly 5 percent to trade at Rs 813.35 apiece. Hindalco Industries and National Aluminium Company (NALCO) shares gained nearly 2 percent, while NMDC, Hindustan Zinc, Vedanta and SAIL shares were up more than 1 percent each. Tata Steel, Welspun Corporation, Adani Enterprises, JSW Steel and Hindustan Copper shares rose up to 1 percent. On the realty index, Brigade Enterprises was the top gainer. The shares of the company rose over 1 percent to trade at Rs 974 apiece. Godrej Properties shares also gained more than 1 percent. DLF and Sobha shares were up nearly 1 percent each. Raymond, Prestige Estates, Macrotech Developers (Lodha), Phoenix Mills and Oberoi Realty shares were trading in the green with marginal gains.

Talks are expected to commence shortly, with the final contract likely to be awarded to the Mazagon Dock–Thyssenkrupp consortium about six months after negotiations are concluded successfully, according to CNBC TV-18 sources. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates The approval marks a key step forward in the P-75(I) deal. The two companies had already signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in June 2023, under which Thyssenkrupp would handle engineering and design, while Mazagon Dock would undertake construction and delivery of the submarines for the Indian Navy. While the development has excited investors, analysts remain cautious. JPMorgan, in a note last week, said there was ""little incremental positive newsflow"" around the award of the P-75(I) contract. The brokerage has an “underweight” rating on Mazagon Dock with a price target of Rs 2,468, citing an unfavourable risk-reward equation even after the stock corrected nearly 30 percent from its peak of Rs 3,775. On July 28, the company reported a net profit of Rs 452 crore for the first quarter of the financial year 2026. This marks a decline of around 35 percent on-year from the Rs 696 crore net profit reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year. Sequentially, the firm's net profit rose nearly 39 percent quarter-on-quarter from the Rs 325 crore reported in Q4 FY25. While net profit declined annually, the firm’s revenue from operations rose over than 11 percent on-year to Rs 2,626 crore in Q1 FY26. Revenue from operations however, fell more than 17 percent sequentially. At about 9:30 am, shares of the company were trading at Rs 2,750, higher by 2 percent from the last close on the NSE. Mazagon Dock shares have tanked 23 percent in the last three months. However, they're still in green on a year-to-date basis, up 21 percent.

At about 9:25 am, the Sensex was up 211.98 points or 0.26 percent at 81,518.83, and the Nifty was up 57.50 points or 0.23 percent at 24,927.60. About 1810 shares advanced, 1144 shares declined, and 197 shares were unchanged. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates ""Powell did something that no one thought he would – he went ahead and signalled that the Fed is ready to cut interest rates at their next meeting. The bar is extremely high now for the Fed to leave rates unchanged in less than a month,"" said market expert Ajay Bagga. He added that investors should align allocations towards risk and rate-sensitive plays—quality cyclicals, duration, and select commodities—while keeping a close eye on upcoming jobs and inflation data. ""Fed chief Powell’s remark at Jackson Hole that ‘there is a downside risk to unemployment and shifting risk balance may warrant policy adjustment’ clearly indicates a rate cut in September. The US stock market gave a thumbs up to this comment, says V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments Ltd. ""The positive factor may not get reflected in the Indian market as much since tariff concerns are likely to weigh more,"" he added. Among individual movers, Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Ltd surged 3 percent after CNBC-TV18 reported that the Ministry of Defence has cleared the company to start cost negotiations with Germany’s Thyssenkrupp Marine for building six submarines under the Rs 70,000-crore P-75(I) project. Talks are expected to begin shortly, with the contract likely to be awarded to Mazagon Dock and Thyssenkrupp around six months after successful negotiations, the report said.

According to Nuvama Alternative & Quantitative Research, 3.52 crore shares—about 20 percent of the company’s outstanding equity—became eligible for trade at the end of the one-and-a-half-year lock-in period. Technical View On the technical front, Nifty is holding on to support near 24,800. A shooting star on the weekly chart, coupled with call writing at higher levels and unwinding of puts, suggests limited upside and prolonged consolidation. Unless the index clears 25,150, upside momentum is likely to remain capped, while holding above 24,800 is critical to avoid deeper cuts. For now, analysts advise a “sell on rise” strategy, with traders watching 25,000 on the upside and 24,800 on the downside for the next decisive move. The Bank Nifty mirrors a similar setup. The index is clinging to support at 55,000 after giving up prior gains, with heightened call writing and put unwinding pointing to a fragile structure. ""Holding above the 55,000 mark is critical to avoid deeper cuts, while any sustained move below it may open the door for further downside. On the upside, only a decisive reclaim above 56,150 would negate the weak bias. For now, the structure favours a ‘sell on rise’ strategy, with traders eyeing 55,000 as the key trigger zone for the next leg of directional momentum,"" said Dhupesh Dhameja of SAMCO Securities. TCS, Tech Mahindra, Bajaj Finance, NTPC and Hindalco were the top gainers on the Nifty. Laggards on the index included ICICI Bank, SBI Life Insurance, Apollo Hospitals, Maruti Suzuki, and Jio Financial Services.

Jackson Hole takeaway: What does Jerome Powell’s speech mean for Indian equities?,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/jackson-hole-takeaway-what-does-jerome-powell-s-speech-mean-for-indian-equities-13482730.html,"Dalal Street is poised to open on a strong footing on Monday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s remarks at the Jackson Hole Symposium lifted global sentiment. Nifty futures were trading at 24,995, up 0.4 percent or 80 points, indicating a positive start. The annual Jackson Hole Symposium, one of the most closely tracked events for global markets, ended on a note that could shape trading in the weeks ahead. Powell acknowledged a “shifting balance of risks” in the US economy, including signs of stress in the labour market, and hinted at possible “policy adjustments” in the coming months. While he cautioned that inflation risks remain elevated, his tone was interpreted as dovish, raising expectations of a rate cut at the Fed’s September 16–17 meeting. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Markets immediately cheered the speech. US equities saw broad-based buying on Friday, and the dollar came under pressure as traders priced in a 25-basis-point cut in September. For India, Powell’s stance has implications for flows and sentiment. ""Powell did something that no one thought he would – he went ahead and signalled that the Fed is ready to cut interest rates at their next meeting. The bar is extremely high now for the Fed to leave rates unchanged in less than a month,"" said market expert Ajay Bagga. He added that investors should align allocations towards risk and rate-sensitive plays—quality cyclicals, duration, and select commodities—while keeping a close eye on upcoming jobs and inflation data. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments, also said Powell’s speech indicates that a September cut is on the table, which could support Indian equities in the short term. Still, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) remain a headwind. Through August, FIIs have sold Rs 25,564 crore worth of shares, taking total equity outflows this year to Rs 1,57,440 crore. The selling has not been confined to equities, as FIIs have been paring bond exposure too. Valuations remain the key concern, with Indian markets trading expensive compared to peers. A weakening dollar, if sustained, could ease the pace of outflows, analysts said. Also read: Online gaming companies likely to approach high courts this week to contest ban on real-money gaming In the near term, three factors will guide market direction: the Fed’s September decision, the trajectory of FII flows, and the outcome of a possible trade deal with the US as the August 27 deadline approaches. Key levels to watch out for in today's session On the technical front, Nifty is holding on to support near 24,800. A shooting star on the weekly chart, coupled with call writing at higher levels and unwinding of puts, suggests limited upside and prolonged consolidation. Unless the index clears 25,150, upside momentum is likely to remain capped, while holding above 24,800 is critical to avoid deeper cuts. For now, analysts advise a “sell on rise” strategy, with traders watching 25,000 on the upside and 24,800 on the downside for the next decisive move. The Bank Nifty mirrors a similar setup. The index is clinging to support at 55,000 after giving up prior gains, with heightened call writing and put unwinding pointing to a fragile structure. ""Holding above the 55,000 mark is critical to avoid deeper cuts, while any sustained move below it may open the door for further downside. On the upside, only a decisive reclaim above 56,150 would negate the weak bias. For now, the structure favours a ‘sell on rise’ strategy, with traders eyeing 55,000 as the key trigger zone for the next leg of directional momentum,"" said Dhupesh Dhameja of SAMCO Securities.

Dalal Street braces for flood of IPO lock-in expiries worth nearly $20 billion in next 3 months,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/dalal-street-braces-for-flood-of-ipo-lock-in-expiries-worth-nearly-20-billion-in-next-3-months-13482805.html,"Dalal Street is heading into a heavy season of IPO lock-in expiries, with a wave of pre-listing shareholder restrictions set to lift over the next three months. According to estimates by Nuvama Institutional Equities, as many as 57 companies will see their lock-ins unwind between August 25 and November 27, releasing close to $20 billion worth of stock into the market. While not all of these shares are expected to immediately hit the secondary market—given that promoters often choose to hold on—brokers and investors alike are bracing for increased activity in the respective counters. Also read: India’s growth likely moderated to 6.6% in Q1FY26: Moneycontrol Poll The upcoming quarter will feature a series of unlocks across a wide swathe of sectors, from cement and jewellery to finance, real estate, and consumer services. In the near term, smaller unlocks will set the tone. For instance, GNG Electronics, Brigade Hotel Ventures, Aditya Infotech, and Sri Lotus Developers are among the first in line as August winds down, collectively putting millions of shares in circulation. September will bring heftier names, such as JSW Cement, which has nearly 37 million shares unlocking in mid-month, and HDB Financial Services, scheduled for late September with 23 million shares. October is lined up with unlocks from companies such as Anthem Biosciences and Travel Food Services, while November could prove decisive with a cluster of names including BlueStone Jewellery, M & B Engineering, and Kalpataru. But the most eye-catching event arrives in November when electric two-wheeler maker Ather Energy sees its six-month lock-in end. A massive 162 million shares—representing 44 percent of its outstanding stock—will become tradable on November 6. The sheer scale of this unlock makes it one of the biggest market events of the quarter. On the same day, Highway Infrastructure and All Time Plastics will also see their restrictions lift, though at a much smaller scale. Later in November, Borana Weaves will unlock 10 percent of its shareholding. What does it mean for the market? The expiry of shareholder lock-ins is a normal part of the IPO cycle but tends to draw heightened attention when multiple large unlocks coincide. This can exert pressure on stock prices in the short run, even if underlying fundamentals remain unchanged. Nuvama, in its report, noted that while the headline figure of $20 billion looks sizeable, the actual impact will depend on how much of this stock enters the market. Promoter groups, for example, typically hold longer, which can soften the blow.

If the pace of FII selling continues, the additional supply from lock-in expiries could amplify pressure on certain counters. Conversely, a more benign global backdrop, including the prospect of US rate cuts as early as next month, could absorb some of the supply more smoothly.

Asian stocks rise as Powell signals Fed will cut,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/asian-stocks-rise-as-powell-signals-fed-will-cut-13483263.html,"Asian equities gained at the open, tracking Wall Street’s rally, after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell opened the door to resuming interest rate cuts. Shares in Japan and South Korea advanced with MSCI’s gauge for the region gaining 0.2%. Australian stocks hit a fresh record. Treasuries opened lower, giving up some of the gains on Friday after Powell’s speech. Yields on the policy-sensitive two-year bond rose one basis point to 3.70%. A gauge of dollar edged up 0.1% after posting its third straight weekly loss. Traders see an 84% chance of a Fed rate cut next month after Powell signaled at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, the central bank may ease before inflation fully returns to target amid a softening hiring environment. That optimism faces key tests this week, including a US inflation reading, Nvidia Corp.’s results and the peak of Asian earnings season. “Powell’s wish-to-reality signal is set to serve as glue on the cracks beneath Asia’s mildly shaking markets,” said Hebe Chen, analyst at Vantage Markets. “For investors, this fresh dose of optimism is likely to keep risk appetite buoyant” through to the next Fed board meeting. In Asia, Chinese stocks will be in focus with questions mounting over how much further the market can rally with concerns of trade tariffs and a deep-rooted property crisis weighing on the economy. While the market’s steady advance may suggest less risk of a sudden correction, some analysts are warning that a bubble is in the making. The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index rose 2.7% Friday and futures indicated a stronger open for shares in Hong Kong and mainland china. “Markets might be expecting, either correctly or incorrectly, that macroeconomic fundamentals will improve,” said Homin Lee, senior macro strategist at Lombard Odier Ltd. in Singapore. “But a bull market will not be sustainable if inflation remains close to 0% and corporate pricing power faces severe headwinds from weak domestic demand.” Sentiment was weak heading into Friday, with the S&P 500 falling for five straight sessions, its longest losing streak since January, as Wall Street pulled back on bets that the Fed was about to reduce borrowing costs. Powell’s comments halted those concerns, sending the S&P 500 soaring to its best day since May. However, Powell, in what was likely his final Jackson Hole speech at the helm of the Fed, detailed the cloudy signals coming from the economy. While the effect of tariffs on prices is now visible, there are still questions about whether that will reignite inflation in a more persistent way, he said. He called the labor market’s current status — with both falling demand for, and declining supply of workers — “curious.” Now comes Nvidia Corp., which is set to report quarterly earnings on Wednesday after the market close. Traders are hoping it can soothe fears about AI spending and effectively confirm that the stock market’s latest rally isn’t just a technology bubble. In commodities, oil held its advance while gold dipped 0.2%."
"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Olectra Greentech, Godawari Power, Aditya Birla Capital, RCF, Pidilite Industries, Netweb, and others on August 25?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-olectra-greentech-godawari-power-aditya-birla-capital-rcf-pidilite-industries-netweb-and-others-on-august-25-13483247.html,"Bears were in action on August 22, driving the benchmark indices down nearly 1 percent with subdued market breadth. A total of 1,704 shares saw selling pressure compared to 1,025 shares that gained on the NSE. The market is expected to remain rangebound until the frontline indices reclaim and sustain above last week's high. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Rajesh Palviya, Senior Vice President Research (Head Technical Derivatives) at Axis Securities Olectra Greentech | CMP: Rs 1,553.5 On the daily and weekly charts, Olectra Greentech has experienced a trend reversal, forming a series of higher tops and bottoms. It has also decisively surpassed the past one-year ""down-sloping trendline"" on a closing basis, which shows trend reversal. Huge volumes signal increased participation. The stock is well placed above its 20, 50, 100, and 200-day SMA, which reconfirms a bullish trend, and these averages are also inching up along with the price rise, further confirming bullish sentiments. The daily, weekly, and monthly strength indicator RSI indicates rising strength. The daily and weekly ""Bollinger Bands"" buy signal indicates increased momentum. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,685, Rs 1,800 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,500 Cummins India | CMP: Rs 3,916 With the current close, Cummins India has decisively surpassed the past one-year ""multiple resistance"" zone of Rs 3,870 levels on a closing basis, indicating bullish sentiments. The stock is well placed above its 20, 50, 100, and 200-day SMA, which reconfirms a bullish trend, and these averages are also inching up along with the price rise, further confirming bullish sentiments. The daily, weekly, and monthly strength indicator RSI indicates rising strength. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 4,060, Rs 4,200 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,835 Godawari Power and Ispat | CMP: Rs 238.61 On the weekly chart, Godawari Power and Ispat has decisively surpassed the past one-year ""down-sloping trendline"" breakout at Rs 220 levels on a closing basis, indicating a strong comeback of bulls. This breakout is accompanied by huge volumes, which signal increased participation. The daily and weekly ""Bollinger Bands"" buy signal indicates increased momentum. The daily, weekly, and monthly strength indicator RSI indicates rising strength. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 277, Rs 300 Stop-Loss: Rs 223 Rajesh Bhosale, Technical Analyst at Angel One Aditya Birla Capital | CMP: Rs 286.35 On the monthly chart, Aditya Birla Capital has registered a breakout after a prolonged seven-year consolidation phase, often signaling the onset of a strong directional move. The breakout is well-supported by robust volume action, with higher volumes on advances and relatively lower volumes on declines, reflecting sustained accumulation and lending credibility to the move. From an indicator standpoint, the RSI smoothened had earlier stabilized near the 50 level and has now turned upward with a bullish crossover, indicating fresh positive momentum and further strengthening the bullish outlook. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 312 Stop-Loss: Rs 273 Asahi India Glass | CMP: Rs 882.85 Asahi India Glass witnessed a multi-month breakout in July, followed by a strong up-move. After a brief consolidation over the past couple of weeks, prices have resumed their uptrend this week with a continuation flag breakout. Currently trading in uncharted territory, the stock reflects inherent strength and clear outperformance against the broader markets. The breakout is further validated by a favourable indicator setup and the formation of a bullish Marubozu candle. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 975 Stop-Loss: Rs 837 Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilizers | CMP: Rs 158.9 During the last week, chemical and fertilizer stocks remained in focus, and Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilizers (RCF) too showcased notable strength. On the weekly chart, it registered a breakout from a strong bullish reversal pattern, the “Inverse Head and Shoulder,” accompanied by above-average volumes. Moreover, on the daily chart, the RSI smoothened crossed above the 60 mark, confirming robust positive momentum in the counter. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 175 Stop-Loss: Rs 149 Anshul Jain, Head of Research at Lakshmishree Investments Pidilite Industries | CMP: Rs 3,087.2 Pidilite recently posted a failed breakdown of its box pattern, defined by outer boundaries at Rs 2,900–3,110. The stock sharply rebounded from the box low and is now consolidating near the box high with an inside bar formation. The bear trap at lower levels has added strength to the structure, as failed breakdowns often act as strong bullish signals. Current price action suggests accumulation around resistance. A breakout and sustained move above Rs 3,120 will confirm bullish continuation and likely propel the stock higher. The immediate upside target stands around Rs 3,400 levels, offering a strong risk-reward opportunity for investors. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,400 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,000 TD Power Systems | CMP: Rs 518 TD Power Systems on the daily charts is showing a classic base-on-base formation, a highly bullish continuation structure. The first base was a 108-day-long rounding pattern, followed by a second base of 63 days, also rounding in nature. Such sequential formations typically indicate strong institutional accumulation and suggest that the stock is setting up for a powerful breakout. However, confirmation will only come on a decisive move and sustained close above Rs 530. Once that occurs, the stock is likely to gather momentum and head towards Rs 570 initially, followed by Rs 600 in the near term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 617.7 Stop-Loss: Rs 500 Netweb Technologies India | CMP: Rs 2,322.4 Netweb posted a 46-day cup and handle breakout, followed by a 12-day pullback and a weak shakeout of longs. The stock has now made a strong comeback, with volumes surging over 870% against its 50-day EMA — a clear sign of institutional accumulation. Price action is currently hovering around the key resistance level of Rs 2,380. A decisive breach and sustained close above Rs 2,380 will act as the trigger for the next strong leg of the uptrend. Once confirmed, the stock is poised to rally sharply and head towards Rs 2,800, supported by momentum and fresh buying interest.

On the other hand, Domestic Institutional Investors (DII) extended their buying in the 18th consecutive week, as they purchased equities worth Rs 10,388.23 crore.

""The domestic market started the week with a gap-up, driven by optimism surrounding GST rationalization. Additionally, a sovereign rating upgrade by S&P added another layer of confidence among investors. However, the rally lost momentum toward the end of the week as investors turned cautious due to profit booking and external headwinds. A spike in the 10-year Indian government bond yield also raised concerns about the fiscal position in light of the GST reforms,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments. ""The market is awaiting clarity on whether the additional 25% U.S. tariffs on Indian goods, linked to the import of Russian oil, will be implemented next week. Simultaneously, investors will closely watch the outcome of the U.S. Fed Chair’s speech at the Jackson Hole symposium for cues on the interest rate trajectory. Despite these external headwinds, domestic economic indicators offer a glimmer of hope."" ""A record-high composite PMI and early signs of an urban demand revival are expected to support the market. The consumption sector is likely to benefit from a favourable monsoon, low interest rates, and indirect tax reliefs."" ""The week ahead will be crucial, with key releases including India’s GDP, along with U.S. growth and inflation data—both of which will be closely tracked for insights into the global economic outlook,"" he added.

Where is Nifty50 headed? Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities After a steady run-up, Nifty paused on Friday, suggesting a brief consolidation before the next leg higher. The index continues to hold above the 50 EMA, reinforcing the short-term uptrend. On the downside, support lies at 24,800; staying above this level keeps the trend intact with scope for an advance towards 25,000–25,250. Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities After showing consolidation-type movement near the resistance of 25200 levels on Thursday, Nifty slipped into a sharp profit booking on Friday and closed the day lower by 213 points. The immediate hurdle of down down-sloping trend line weighed heavily on the market and resulted in sharp weakness. The short-term trend of Nifty is weak, and we expect Nifty to find support around the previous opening upside gap of 18th Aug, around 24800-24700 levels by next week. On the other side, a sustainable upside above 25150 could bring bulls back into the scene. Santosh Meena, Head of Research at Swastika Investmart. Despite news of a GST rate cut, FIIs maintain approximately 90% short positions in index futures. Additionally, market sentiment is cautious due to the looming threat of a 25% tariff on India, with a deadline set for August 27, 2025. Globally, uncertainty persists due to mixed U.S. economic data and ambiguity surrounding the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions. Investors are closely monitoring today’s U.S. jobs report and the Federal Reserve Chairman’s speech at the Jackson Hole symposium for further clarity. From a technical perspective, the Nifty faces strong resistance in the 25,100–25,225 range. The 24,850–24,700 zone is a critical support level that must hold to sustain bullish momentum. A breach below this could see the index slide toward its 200-day moving average (DMA) at 24,050, signaling potential bearish pressure.

Dow notches record high as Wall Street cheers Powell's speech,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/dow-notches-record-high-as-wall-street-cheers-powell-s-speech-13481463.html,"Wall Street's main indexes ended higher on Friday, with the blue-chip Dow hitting a record closing high, as investors piled into stocks after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted at a near-term interest-rate cut during his Jackson Hole Symposium speech. His comments paved the way for a potential rate cut at the Fed's September meeting, although Powell stressed the importance of jobs and inflation data due before then. ""Powell did what central bankers do best at Jackson Hole — he kept the door open,"" said Nigel Green, chief executive of deVere Group. “A cut in September would reassure households and businesses that the central bank is not asleep at the wheel. Delaying only raises the odds of a harder landing."" Traders boosted bets on a September rate cut after Powell's comments, now placing a nearly 90% chance of a reduction, versus about 75% before Powell's remarks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 846.24 points, or 1.89%, to 45,631.74, surpassing its most recent record close on December 4, 2024. The S&P 500 gained 96.74 points, or 1.52%, to 6,466.91 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 396.22 points, or 1.88%, to 21,496.54. Ten of the 11 S&P 500 sub-sectors traded higher, with consumer discretionary (.SPLRCD), opens new tab the biggest gainer, up 3.18%. The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index soared 2.7%, while most megacap growth stocks also jumped. Tesla led gains with 6.2%. The rate-sensitive Russell 2000 Index surged 4.1%, hitting its highest level so far this year. With gains on Friday, the S&P 500 snapped a five-day losing streak after a broad selloff in heavyweight technology stocks pressured U.S. equities this week. For the week, both the S&P and Dow ended with gains, while the Nasdaq fell 0.6% as investors sold this week megacap tech stocks and rotated into less-pricey stocks. U.S. stocks have rebounded sharply from April lows - when markets were rattled by President Donald Trump's tariff announcements. Recently, indexes have been getting back up to record highs. A spate of resilient earnings, optimism around trade deals and growing chances of interest-rate cuts have been some of the main gain drivers, although some concerns persist.""Investors are cheering Powell's comments like it's the start of a rate-cut parade. But one cut won't move the needle on consumer spending. The bigger question is whether this marks a true pivot in Fed policy — or if rising tariffs will force it to slam the brakes before that shift even begins,"" said Zak Stambor, senior analyst for retail and ecommerce at Emarketer. Earlier in the day, UBS Global Wealth Management lifted its year-end target for the S&P 500 for the second time in two months, betting on corporate earnings strength, easing trade tensions and expectations of interest-rate cuts. Among other top movers, Intel gained 5.5% as the White House was expected to announce on Friday the acquisition of a 10% stake in the company. Coinbase (COIN.O), opens new tab also soared 6.5% as investors scooped up crypto-related shares after Powell's speech. Intuit dropped roughly 5% after the TurboTax-maker forecast first-quarter revenue growth below analysts' estimates due to weak performance at its Mailchimp marketing platform. Workday shed 3% after the human resources software provider provided an in-line outlook for the current quarter. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 9.43-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. There were 590 new highs and 42 new lows on the NYSE. The S&P 500 posted 37 new 52-week highs and no new lows while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 166 new highs and 47 new lows. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 17.93 billion shares, compared with the 17.08 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days."
"US takes nearly 10% Intel stake, clinching unorthodox deal",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/us-takes-nearly-10-intel-stake-clinching-unorthodox-deal-13481324.html,"President Donald Trump sealed a deal that gives the US government a nearly 10% stake in Intel Corp., part of an unconventional bid to reinvigorate the beleaguered company and boost domestic chip manufacturing. Under the agreement, the US will receive 433.3 million shares of common stock — representing 9.9% of the fully diluted common shares in Intel — according to a statement from the company. The $8.9 billion investment will be funded by grants from the US Chips and Science Act and Secure Enclave program that had previously been extended but not yet paid, Intel said, confirming a report by Bloomberg News. Together with the $2.2 billion in Chips Act money that Intel already received, the investment totaled $11.1 billion. The government will be a passive owner, with no board seat or other governance or information rights, Intel said. “We are grateful for the confidence the president and the administration have placed in Intel, and we look forward to working to advance US technology and manufacturing leadership,” Intel Chief Executive Officer Lip-Bu Tan said in the statement. Intel shares rose 5.5% to $24.80 at the close in New York on Friday. They slipped about 1% in choppy postmarket trading after the deal was finalized. In a social media post, Trump described the transaction as a “great Deal for America and, also, a great Deal for INTEL.” “Building leading edge Semiconductors and Chips, which is what INTEL does, is fundamental to the future of our Nation,” he said. The US taking partial ownership marks a stunning level of intervention in an American company, cutting against the principles of free-market capitalism that investors and policymakers have long considered sacrosanct except in the most extraordinary situations, such as war or a systemic economic crisis. The administration considers it an extraordinary and unique situation — and sees semiconductor production as a matter of national security, a White House official said. Intel is one of a small number of American companies capable of making chips at scale on domestic soil, the official said, and the administration looks to avoid shortages like those in recent years that rattled US supply chains. Though the administration telegraphed its intentions with Intel in recent weeks, the move creates untold risks that could distort markets and the flow of capital as well as lead to massive taxpayer losses. But the government’s bet could also pay off in a major way for a onetime industry pioneer. Intel has faced a turbulent stretch with investors worried it is losing its technological edge and falling too far behind competitors. The approach represents a new way for Trump to wield Chips Act funding, after long assailing the law signed by his predecessor, former President Joe Biden. Trump has said the law’s subsidies for semiconductor manufacturers didn’t provide any return for US taxpayers. Intel was already poised to be the biggest beneficiary of money from the Chips Act. As part of the pact, the government will receive a five-year warrant — at $20 per share for an additional 5% of common stock — that’s only exercisable if Intel ceases to own at least 51% of its chip-manufacturing business. PJT Partners served as Intel’s financial adviser on the transaction. Santa Clara, California-based Intel touted its more than $100 billion effort to expand manufacturing in the US and its new factory in Arizona, which is set to begin high-volume production this year. But it didn’t discuss a facility planned for Ohio that has been repeatedly delayed. The deal represents a dramatic reversal from earlier this month, when Trump called for Tan’s ouster and accused him of being “highly conflicted” because of concerns over his earlier ties to China. Those remarks prompted the sit-down between the president and the Intel CEO, laying the groundwork for Friday’s deal. “I said, ‘You know what? I think the United States should be given 10% of Intel,’ and he said, ‘I would consider that,’ and I said, ‘Well, I’d like you to do that,’” Trump said of his discussion with Tan. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has signaled that Trump wants to see more direct benefits to the US from funding key companies instead of just giving away grants. Lutnick worked to finalize the details of the agreement since Tan and Trump’s meeting. While the White House has cast the Intel deal as a possible template for other companies, they haven’t said which ones it may be having similar discussions with. A US official, however, said that companies that are boosting US investment pledges, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Micron Technology Inc., will not be pressured to offer equity in exchange for funding. The fresh infusion of nearly $9 billion instantly boosts growth prospects for the company. It also opens the door to partnerships that could be critical in developing new intellectual property and technology, areas where Intel has lagged in recent years. Still, in order for government ownership to boost Intel, Trump will have to do more than just take a stake. Wall Street analysts don’t expect money alone to turn around the company, which has suffered from years of declining sales and market share. But there is a possibility that pressure from Trump will help line up more clients for Intel’s production arm, potentially justifying the cost of expanding domestic manufacturing. “Trump kind of becomes your salesman,” said Dan Morgan, a senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust who has covered the company since the 1990s. Lining up more Intel clients might be a tough sell for Trump. The company’s chip-manufacturing arm is widely considered inferior to rivals and it still must build new cutting-edge facilities. “Beside money, Intel needs customers,” Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said in a note to clients. “Funding a buildout with no customers probably won’t end well for shareholders, of whom the US government would be the largest under this situation,” he said. In its statement, Intel said it was “deeply engaged” with current and potential clients and partners that could help build up the US chip supply chain. Microsoft Corp., Dell Technologies Inc., HP Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.’s AWS all pledged support as part of the announcement. “The industry needs a strong and resilient US semiconductor industry, and no company is more important to this mission than Intel,” Michael Dell, CEO of the namesake computer maker, said in the statement. The Intel deal exemplifies how Trump has embraced a new brand of economic statecraft in his second term, as he looks to bolster domestic manufacturing, rebalance trade ties and ensure American dominance in critical sectors. Trump in early August announced a legally questionable arrangement with Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., in which they agreed to give the US government 15% of revenue generated from sales of artificial intelligence chips to China. That followed Trump securing a “golden share” from Nippon Steel Corp. that gives the president power to make decisions over United States Steel Corp., which the Japanese steelmaker acquired. The Defense Department last month also announced that it will take a $400 million equity stake in little-known US rare-earths firm MP Materials Corp."

"SEBI chief calls for more caution, transparency from MFs when investing in microcaps, debt papers",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sebi-chief-calls-for-more-caution-transparency-from-mfs-when-investing-in-microcaps-debt-papers-13481048.html,"Market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) Chairman, Tuhin Kanta Pandey, appreciated the efforts of the mutual fund industry in channelising savings at an event marking 30 years of the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI). However, he also cautioned the industry about investing in microcaps and certain debt instruments. Pandey said, “While there is a need to diversify beyond blue chips, mutual funds—as a retail product—should exercise caution while investing in microcaps or debt papers through bespoke deals. Maintaining proper documentation for such investment decisions ensures transparency and sound due diligence.” The SEBI chief also advised the industry to ensure that no preferential treatment is given to any class of investors during subscriptions or redemptions. He said, “By strictly adhering to the cut-off time for all classes of unit holders, the industry can instill a greater degree of confidence among investors.” Pandey further highlighted that beyond investment risks, the industry must also be mindful of operational risks that could undermine investor confidence. He noted, “One such concern is the menace of fraudulent redemptions by impersonators. As fraudsters grow more creative, we must remain vigilant.” He added that whenever such cases are detected, asset management companies (AMCs) must act promptly and monitor emerging patterns in these practices. Sharing such modus operandi across AMCs and registrar and transfer agents (RTAs) is essential to immediately prevent recurrence. “In this battle, speed of information is our greatest weapon,” he emphasised. The SEBI chief also pointed to the vulnerabilities that come with growing reliance on technology. “As more investors interact digitally, even a single breach can cause lasting damage to investor confidence,” he warned. Pandey also stressed the importance of data privacy, saying, “Protecting that data is as important as protecting their money. It must be a top priority for mutual funds.” On outsourcing, he remarked that while outsourcing has enabled efficiency, it does not reduce accountability. “Mutual funds remain fully responsible for the actions of vendors or partners. AMCs’ agreements with vendors or third parties must ensure there is no scope for data leakage,” he said.

On this Foundation Day, I urge you to innovate responsibly, balance creativity with caution, grow inclusively, reach investors in every village, town, and city, and uphold trust relentlessly.” He concluded by saying, “Mutual funds are not just financial products; they are enablers of aspiration, bridges to opportunity. Today, as a reaffirmation of our collective mission, let us make mutual funds not just ‘sahi hai,’ but ‘zaruri hai’—not just the right choice, but the default choice, depending on varying risk appetites and financial goals.”"

Foseco India announced that it has entered into a share purchase agreement to buy 42 lakh shares of Morganite Crucible (MCIL), representing 75 percent of its total share capital, for a total cash consideration of Rs 653.94 crore. The company will buy the stake from MCIL promoters at Rs 1,557 per share. The stake acquisition will be done by issuing and allotting 11.51 lakh fully paid-up equity shares of the Foseco India (constituting 15.27 percent of its total issued and paid-up share capital), to the MCIL promoters at a price of Rs 5,674 per consideration share. MCIL promoters will get 274 consideration shares of Foseco India for every 1,000 shares of MCIL they own, as part of the preferential allotment of shares. The stake acquisition will trigger a mandatory open offer by Foseco India. ""The execution of the Share Purchase Agreement for the Underlying Transaction will trigger a mandatory open offer by the Company together with the Company Promoters (in their capacity as 'persons acting in concert’ with the Company)...for the acquisition of up to 14 lakh fully paid-up equity shares of MCIL, representing 25 percent of the total equity voting share capital of MCIL on a fully diluted basis, from the public shareholders of MCIL, at a price of Rs 1,557.15 per Offer Share aggregating to a total consideration of up to Rs 218 crore,"" it said. MCIL is associated with the business of designing, manufacturing, marketing and selling crucibles and other foundry consumable products for various metal melting and handling applications. ""This proposed acquisition aligns with the larger acquisition of the worldwide Molten Metal Systems business by the Vesuvius Group from the Morgan Group. The rationale for the proposed acquisition is to expand the Vesuvius Group’s Foundry business into the faster-growing non-ferrous market segment and to India, in line with the Group’s strategic ambitions. The global MMS business is complementary to the Vesuvius Group’s Foundry business and will also increase the Vesuvius Group’s global Foundry business’s exposure to the Indian market. Substantial cost synergies are expected to create value for the Vesuvius Group,” Foseco India said. Foseco India shares later pared some gains to close nearly 14 percent higher at Rs 6,380 apiece.

JLL delivered a modest Q1FY26 performance amid a challenging demand environment, with revenue up by 1.4% YoY on 3.6% volume growth, while value growth was constrained by higher grammage and promotional pricing. Gross margin contracted 280bps YoY to 48.5%, due to input cost pressures and heightened competition in the Dish wash segment. EBITDA margin stood at 16.5%, in line with guidance, while PAT declined 4.9% YoY to Rs. 96.8cr. A&P Spend moderated to Rs. 58.9 crore (7.8% of revenue), balancing brand investment with margin protection. H2FY26 to see improvement in margins and the company guides for 16-17% EBITDA margin for FY26. Segment wise, Fabric Care led the growth (3% YoY) while Dishwash and Personal Care remained stable. Household Insecticides (HI) remained under pressure (-9.7% YoY), though management reiterated its turnaround focus with new launches and pricing actions. New launches across categories (Ujala Young & Fresh, Jovia, Maxo aerosols) are gaining traction, with more planned in H2FY26 to drive growth. Outlook We value JLL at a P/E of 34x (2yr avg=36x), with a target price of Rs. 412, and recommend BUY rating supported by rural tailwinds, innovation-led growth, improving urban sentiment and recent stock price correction.

The dip in the 13.8% EBITDA margins (16.2%, Q1 FY25) is attributed to one-time provisions. YTD orders were diverse (EPC, BESS, T&D). Execution is the key monitorable as ~50% of orders (~Rs73bn of ~Rs147bn) awaits AD or LOA. The ~Rs10.5bn leverage is high but expected to normalize on disbursement from solar SPVs. Proceeds from approved monetisation of five HAM assets in FY26 would fortify the BS. We retain FY26/27e revenues but reduce EBITDA margins ~64/24bps. We introduce FY28e revenue/EBITDA of ~Rs85.4bn/12.3bn. Outlook We are retaining our Buy rating with a lower sum-of-parts TP of ~Rs1,339 (earlier Rs1,749), the core EPC business at 9x Sep’27e EPS considering delayed receipt of AD and the foray into uncharted solar, BESS and T&D.

SEBI’s expiry-day clampdown: Can it curb alleged Jane Street-style manipulation?,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sebi-s-expiry-day-clampdown-can-it-curb-alleged-jane-street-style-manipulation-13480420.html,"The Securities and Exchange Board of India’s (Sebi) plan to impose penalties for intraday position breaches on expiry days could put large algo funds and prop desk on the guard, but will not be adequate to meaningfully curb the “Jane Street–style” alleged manipulation that triggered regulatory scrutiny, traders say. As Moneycontrol reported on August 19, Sebi is weighing a new framework under which intraday position limits will be raised to Rs 5,000 crore net delta (from Rs 1,500 crore), while the gross cap remains at Rs 10,000 crore. Breaches on expiry days could invite financial penalties, whereas on non-expiry days they would only trigger surveillance. Currently, Sebi has not formally defined intraday limits, though exchanges are advised to monitor the same thresholds through the session. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Market participants say penalties will certainly make prop desks cautious about their trades on expiry days because of heightened surveillance, yet they may not be effective in preventing manipulation. They cite two main reasons. First, limits apply to a single PAN. Large proprietary desks already split trades across multiple accounts to remain below thresholds. Second, surveillance lacks tools to track exposures of entities acting in concert — the very issue raised in Sebi’s allegations against Jane Street. Unless there is a mechanism for the exchanges to track group exposures in real time, they will be ineffective in calling out rogue trades. While no single prop desk in India currently has the kind of capital that could move markets like Jane Street did, a similar effect could be achieved with large prop desks acting in concert. Currently, Gross Future Equivalent (FutEq) OI for a single PAN is capped at Rs 10,000 crore. It would cost about Rs 80–240 crore in premium to buy ATM options or about Rs 3,000–4,000 crore to sell options to hit the gross position limit of Rs 10,000 crore. If, while selling options, insurance legs are added, margin requirements reduce by around one-third. The popular strategy of selling a plain straddle with insurance (short iron butterfly) would require capital (margin requirement) of roughly Rs 1,200 crore, according to rough calculations by veteran trader Santosh Pasi. This is fairly sizable for a single entity – not because the capital is big but the risk it entails is not since options are being sold.

Even then, it may be a challenge to figure out manipulation if traders/large prop desks are acting in concert to steer trades to their benefit."

"ITC, Nestle, other FMCG stocks drop up to 2%, extend losses to second day after 3-day rally",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/itc-nestle-other-fmcg-stocks-drop-up-to-2-extend-losses-to-second-day-after-3-day-rally-13480265.html,"The shares of major FMCG companies dropped on August 22, pushing the Nifty FMCG index down for the second consecutive session. This comes after the stocks recorded strong gains for three consecutive sessions on optimism over prospective GST reforms. Nifty FMCG index was down 1 percent to stand at 55,742.05, as seen at 1:05 pm. The index had gained nearly 4 percent between August 18 and August 20, after Prime Minister Narendra Modi hinted at the next generation of Goods and Services Tax (GST) reforms to be announced as a Diwali gift for consumers. Investors may have then resorted to profit booking after the strong spike in the sector. The Nifty FMCG index has dropped over 1.6 percent in two sessions. ITC and Colgate Palmolive shares dropped nearly 2 percent each, while Nestle India and Marico shares were down over 1 percent. Emami, United Breweries (UBL), Hindustan Unilever (HUL) and Britannia Industries shares were trading in the red with marginal losses. Bucking the trend, Varun Beverages, Tata Consumer Products, Radico Khaitan and Dabur shares were trading in the green with marginal gains, while Godrej Consumer Products were up more than 1 percent. In its latest report, Axis Securities noted that the FMCG sector r delivered modest single-digit topline growth in Q1FY26, largely driven by price hikes and improving sentiment in select urban pockets. “Unseasonal rains weighed on summer-led categories like beverages and glucose. Nonetheless, management commentary across companies reflects optimism, with most anticipating volume recovery over the next 2–3 quarters, supported by easing inflation and improving macro indicators,” the brokerage said. Axis Securities noted that urban markets, which contribute to nearly 50-60 percent of total FMCG sales, continue to face headwinds due to muted wage growth, higher EMIs, and stiff competition from emerging distribution formats like D2C and Q-commerce. However, rural demand remains robust despite macro headwinds. “Looking ahead, we maintain a constructive outlook for the FMCG sector. With rural inflation easing, higher MSPs, healthy monsoon projections, and increased government spending, we expect rural consumption to remain a key growth lever. Moreover, the upcoming quarters—particularly H2FY26 are expected to bring about a more broad-based volume recovery, fueled by seasonal tailwinds, improved consumer sentiment, and monetary policy support,” it added, while naming Varun Beverages and DOMS Industries as its top picks in the sector.

Accumulate Tata Motors; target of Rs 722: Deven Choksey,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/accumulate-tata-motors-target-of-rs-722-deven-choksey-13479525.html,"Deven Choksey's research report on Tata Motors Tata Motors’ consolidated revenue declined by 2.5% YoY (-12.6% QoQ) to INR 1,044.1bn, largely in-line with our estimates (-2.1%). The growth was majorly driven by improved product mix, partially offset weaker JLR and domestic volumes. Domestic dispatches fell sharply by 9.1% YoY (-18.2% QoQ) to 297,701 units due to muted demand, while JLR wholesale volume witnessed a decline of 10.7% YoY to 87,286 units, as it was severely impacted by US tariffs and model transitions. Outlook We have revised our FY26E/FY27E EBITDA estimates by -10.4%/-6.5% respectively, factoring weaker JLR margins and subdued domestic demand. We have roll-forwarded our valuation basis to Jun’27 estimates. We value Tata Motors on a SOTP basis, implying a target price of INR 722 per share. We maintain our “ACCUMULATE” rating on the stock.

Divis Laboratories stock jumps 3% as Citi says recent correction is a buying opportunity; 28% upside seen,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/divis-laboratories-stock-jumps-3-as-citi-says-recent-correction-is-a-buying-opportunity-28-upside-seen-13479383.html,"Shares of Divis Laboratories rose 3 percent to Rs 6,188 on Friday, August 22, after global brokerage Citi turned upbeat on the stock, flagging attractive valuations and sector tailwinds. Citi reiterated its buy call with a price target of Rs 7,750, implying nearly 28.5 percent upside from the last close of Rs 6,028 per share on the NSE. The brokerage said the recent weakness in the stock offers a good entry point, dismissing concerns around Orforglipron, Eli Lilly’s oral GLP-1 candidate. It noted that even with consensus sales estimates of over $15 billion by 2030, Divi’s is still positioned to clock $200–300 million in intermediate supplies. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Divi’s is expected to remain a critical API supplier for Entresto, which is the single-largest product in its Custom Synthesis portfolio. Brokerages estimate Entresto APIs contribute as much as 40 percent of Custom Synthesis revenue and nearly 20 percent of Divi’s consolidated topline. Last month, after MSN Laboratories won a US patent case that could allow a generic launch post-July 2025, IIFL had warned of potential earnings risks for Divi’s. For now, however, Citi sees the backdrop as favourable, with reasonable valuations and a healthy order pipeline supporting the stock. Citi also highlighted stronger uptake of Tirzepatide (a GLP-1 injection) as further evidence of rising demand in the peptide segment, a key market for Divi’s. On Entresto, Novartis’ blockbuster heart failure drug with annual sales of about $6 billion, Citi argued that investor concerns over a US generic entry may be overstated. It pointed out that Divi’s continues to supply APIs without disruption, suggesting little or no exposure to the US market. The Hyderabad-based pharmaceutical major reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 545 crore for the June 2025 quarter, a 26.7 percent increase over Rs 430 crore in the corresponding period last year. Revenue from operations came in at Rs 2,410 crore, higher by 13.8 percent compared with Rs 2,118 crore in Q1 FY25. Total income for the quarter stood at Rs 2,529 crore, against Rs 2,197 crore in the year-ago period. At about 11:45 am, shares of the company were trading at Rs 6,143, higher by 2 percent from the last close on the NSE. Divis Laboratories' stock price is down 8 percent over the last month.

The transaction, executed at Rs 7,850 a share, is about 1 percent below the previous day’s closing price, and was facilitated by Morgan Stanley India.

The promoter group said it remains fully focused on the growth of Apollo Hospitals, Apollo Health Co, and Apollo Health and Lifestyle, and has no plans to further reduce stake in the foreseeable future. The move comes amid growing investor scrutiny of promoter pledges and signals a strategic effort to strengthen the group’s financial position while maintaining long-term commitment to the business.

The sharp rise in the share prices pushed the Nifty India Defence index up nearly 1 percent to hover around 7,760.25. Russia launched one of its largest attacks on Ukraine, sending 574 drones and 40 missiles to the neighboring country, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. One person was killed and 22 were wounded in the overnight strikes, authorities said. According to Zelenskyy, a missile strike on a US-owned electronics firm was a ""telling"" indicator of Russian intentions in US-led peace initiatives. ""Now the signals from Russia are simply, to be honest, indecent. They are trying to back away from the need to hold meetings. They don't want to end the war. They carry on with massive strikes,"" he said in a video address. This comes after US President Donald Trump said earlier this week that there was an agreement for a bilateral meeting between Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Vladimir Putin now demands that Ukraine gives up all of the eastern Donbas region, renounce ambitions to join NATO, remain neutral and keep Western troops out of the country, Reuters reported citing sources. The Russian President met Donald Trump in Alaska last week for the first Russia-US summit in more than four years and spent almost all of their three-hour closed meeting discussing what a compromise on Ukraine might look like, the report further said. The defence stocks had earlier tumbled amid rising ceasefire talks and lack of fresh triggers. The fresh escalations in the Russia-Ukraine war may have re-boosted the stocks. DCX Systems shares rallied around 10.5 percent to trade at Rs 275.50 apiece. Solar Industries and Zen Technologies shares gained around 2 percent each. Astra Microwave Products, Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL), Bharat Electronics (BEL) and Paras Defence shares gained around 1 percent each, while Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers (GRSE), BEML and Bharat Dynamics (BDL) shares were trading in the green with marginal gains.

Urban infra lender Hudco likely to cross annual loan book guidance of Rs 1.5 lakh crore during Q3FY25,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/urban-infra-lender-hudco-likely-to-cross-annual-loan-book-guidance-of-rs-1-5-lakh-crore-during-q3fy25-13479184.html,"Hudco, a lender for government-backed housing and urban development projects, said the company is likely to cross its annual loan book guidance of Rs 1.5 lakh crore during Q3FY25, and could end up lending around Rs 1.55-1.60 lakh crore this fiscal, though the lender will review the guidance after the second quarter for any changes. ""...after Q2, we will be revisiting and we'll see that if the guidance needs to be changed. ...we will be crossing Rs 1.50 lakh crore may be in Q3 or sometime before that,"" said Hudco's CMD Sanjay Kulshrestha during the June quarter earnings call earlier this month. The lender has sanctioned over Rs 32,000 crore during the first quarter, with disbursement of around Rs 12,812 crore, which makes the sanction to disbursement ratio at around 35 percent. This disbursement amount is all-time high for the company, and Hudco said it is now targetting around 30 percent growth on full-year disbursement for FY25, which was Rs 40,000 crore. On YoY basis, Hudco's loan sanction has risen 143 percent during the June quarter to Rs 34,224 crore, with loan disbursement rising by 1.48 percent on year. For FY25, the disbursement has grown by 122 percent on year, while sanctions rose by 55 percent. Hudco said for the past 10 quarters, the lender has not recorded new NPAs and is moving towards being a 'zero NPA company', with net NPA down to slightly less than 0.1 percent. As of now, around one-third of Hudco's borrowing is based on floating rate and rest is fixed rate borrowing. ""Hudco is a company which is not agnostic to any sector, and we are funding to each and every sector. We are serving the requirement of state government. In some states, the roads may be the priority, but in other states, the river linking is a priority,"" chairman Sanjay Kulshrestha said. ""...we have started exploring new areas, new segments, new infrastructure segment. We had also explored new states and other entities...,"" the chairman added."

Its ability to leverage group cargo while steadily growing third-party volumes (52% in 1Q FY26) underlines its position in India’s port and logistics ecosystem. The company has reiterated that expanding port capacity remains a core priority, with plans to scale from 177MTPA today to 400MTPA by FY30. Alongside ports, JSWINFRA is pursuing an aggressive logistics infrastructure build-out under JSW Ports Logistics, supported by an investment plan of INR90b through FY30. This expansion is expected to deliver revenue of INR80b and EBITDA of INR20b at scale. Outlook We expect JSWINFRA to strengthen its market dominance, leading to a 13% volume CAGR over FY25-27E. This should drive a 22% CAGR in revenue and a 23% CAGR in EBITDA over the same period. We reiterate our BUY rating with a TP of INR380 (premised on 23x FY27 EV/EBITDA).

"Metal, real estate stocks drop up to 2% ahead of Fed chief Powell's Jackson Hole speech",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/metal-real-estate-stocks-drop-up-to-2-ahead-of-fed-chief-powell-s-jackson-hole-speech-13479158.html,"The shares of metal and real estate companies tumbled on August 22, pushing the two sectoral indices into the red sharply. This comes ahead of US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's speech at the annual Jackson Hole symposium. The Nifty Metal index declined over 0.7 percent to stand at 9,424, while the Nifty Realty index fell more than 0.5 percent to hover around 912, as seen at 10.20 am. The American central bank is holding its annual symposium from August 21 to August 23 in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak on the economic outlook and central bank's policy framework on Friday. US President Donald Trump has criticised Powell multiple times for not cutting rates. In a Truth Social post, Trump referred to Powell as ""Jerome ‘Too Late’ Powell"" and accused him of not acting promptly to reduce interest rates. He also stated that Powell is ""hurting"" the housing industry ""very badly"" and reiterated his call for a cut in key interest rates. Most investors now expect a 25-basis-point Fed rate cut next month. A rate cut in the US could reduce borrowing costs for foreign investors, encouraging them to invest in higher growth markets in India. This boosts real estate and metal stocks. Additionally, investors expect the RBI to follow Fed in the pursuit of a rate cut, if any. This too can further impact the stocks. JSW Steel and Jindal Steel & Power shares dropped over 1.3 percent each, while Steel Authority of India (SAIL) and Hindustan Zinc shares fell more than 1 percent each. Adani Enterprises, Hindustan Copper, Tata Steel and National Aluminium Company (NALCO) shares fell nearly 1 percent each, while Hindalco, Vedanta and Welspun Corp shares were down with marginal losses. Raymond shares were the top loser on the realty index, dropping nearly 2 percent to trade at Rs 622 apiece. Oberoi Realty, Macrotech Developers (Lodha), DLF and Anant Raj shares fell nearly 1 percent each, while Phoenix Mills, Brigade Enterprises and Godrej Properties shares were down marginally in the red."

"Vodafone Idea shares jump 7% after report says PMO to take a call on relief measures; should you buy, sell or hold?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/vodafone-idea-shares-jump-4-after-report-says-pmo-to-take-a-call-on-relief-measures-should-you-buy-sell-or-hold-13478975.html,"The shares of Vodafone Idea (Vi) closed over 7 percent higher at Rs 7.02 apiece on August 22 after a report by Mint said that the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) is set to take a call on a relief proposal for the telecom major. The shares of the company were trading at Rs 7.13 apiece in the afternoon. Earlier during the day, the stock had rallied nearly 12 percent to hit an intraday high of Rs 7.31 apiece. PMO had received an informal note from the Department of Telecommunication (DoT), proposing multiple relief options for the debt-ridden telecom company, Mint reported citing people familiar with the matter. These options include another two-year pause on paying the statutory dues under moratorium currently. The PMO will take the decision on whether these relief measures are to be extended, said the Mint report cited a source as saying. DoT has also proposed to give Vodafone Idea more time to repay dues, smaller annual payouts, and a waiver on penalties and interest penalties on AGR payment, the report added. Moneycontrol couldn't independently verify the report. Vodafone Idea has been struggling with dues, owing about Rs 83,400 crore in adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues, with annual payments of nearly Rs 18,000 crore scheduled from March 2025. Its overall dues to the government stand at around Rs 2 trillion including penalty and interest, Mint said. The debt-laden operator has repeatedly warned it cannot survive without funding support, as banks remain wary of lending given its financial stress. Vi employs over 18,000 people and has nearly 198 million subscribers. Telecom service provider Vodafone Idea (Vi) is exploring non-bank avenues to fund its capital expenditure plans, as negotiations with lenders remain stalled due to uncertainty over adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues, outgoing CEO Akshaya Moondra said on August 18 during the June quarter earnings call. Vi has also formally urged the government to settle the AGR matter ahead of the March 2026 deadline, which Moondra said would help reassure banks and unlock financing support. ""Given the fact that we are keen on maintaining a continuity of our capex, which has been going on since last year, we are looking at non-banking sources of funding, also not the full amount of Rs 25,000 crore that we have talked about, but a lesser amount so that we can continue with the capex cycle,"" Moondra said. Should you buy, sell or hold? Motilal Oswal recommended a 'Sell' rating for the stock, with a target price of Rs 6 per share. This implies a downside potential of more than 8 percent from the previous closing price of Rs 6.55 per share. “We cut our FY27-28E revenue and EBITDA estimates by ~4-5% each, driven by higher subscriber declines. We reiterate our SELL rating on Vi with a revised TP of INR6, based on DCF implied ~12.5x Sep’27E EV/EBITDA,” the domestic brokerage said. ICICI Securities kept a 'Hold' rating for the stock, with a target price of Rs 7 per share. This implies an upside potential of nearly 7 percent from the previous closing price. “VIL has funding to incur elevated capex only till Q2FY26; its future capex is dependent on closing the funding arrangement which has been in the process for a while. VIL is also hopeful of a resolution on AGR matter before its first EMI due in Mar’26, remains critical for establishing its going concern status,” the brokerage noted.

"Markets snap 6-day rally: Sensex down 400 pts, Nifty below 25,000 as bank, metal, IT stocks drag",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/markets-snap-6-day-rally-sensex-down-400-pts-nifty-below-25-000-as-bank-metal-it-stocks-drag-13478724.html,"Benchmark indices Nifty and Sensex were off to a weak start, snapping their 6-day gaining streak on Friday, August 22, as investors booked profit at elevated levels. Auto, bank, metal and IT stocks were the big drags while the broader market mirrored weak trends to edge lower. At about 9:40 am, the Sensex was down 396.99 points or 0.48 percent at 81,603.72, and the Nifty was down 127.65 points or 0.51 percent at 24,956.10. About 1246 shares advanced, 1661 shares declined, and 135 shares were unchanged. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates ""The six-day rally in equities could run into resistance as Trump’s proposed tariffs loom large. If the 25 percent levy takes effect in August—as now seems likely—the drag on India’s growth could exceed the earlier 20–30 basis point estimates based on reciprocal tariffs. Markets will have to price in that risk,"" V K Vijayakumar of Geojit Investments Ltd said. ""However, a key development has been the relative strength of largecaps, a trend that appears both justified and sustainable, he added. At the open, sectoral trends were mixed. Pharma, media, energy and consumer durables posted modest gains, while FMCG and realty were flat. On the other hand, metals, banks, IT, oil & gas and autos were under pressure, dragging broader indices lower. The India VIX inched up 2.1 percent, signalling some uptick in market volatility. Midcap and smallcap indices also opened in the red. Among individual stocks, Apollo Hospitals Enterprises fell 1 percent to Rs 7,852 in morning deals on August 22 after Suneeta Reddy, promoter and managing director of the company, offloaded 1.32 percent of her holding in the healthcare major through a block transaction, Bloomberg data showed. The deal, involving approximately 18.97 lakh shares, is valued at Rs 1,489 crore and has a floor price of Rs 7,850 per share. FMCG bellwether, Hindustan Unilever, traded in the red after it announced a leadership transition, appointing Niranjan Gupta as its next Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and member of the Management Committee. Gupta will take charge as CFO and Executive Director, Finance from November 1, 2025, succeeding Ritesh Tiwari, who has been elevated as Global Head of M&A and Treasury at Unilever Plc. Technical View Nifty’s broader structure remains constructive, with higher lows indicating persistent buying interest. The near-equal positioning of both call and put writers highlights the possibility of a consolidation phase, but a sustained move above 25,150 could unlock the next leg higher towards 25,250, likely forcing call writers into short covering. Support zones have shifted higher, with 24,850–25,000 now emerging as the key demand area. Firm positioning by put writers at lower strikes further strengthens the positive outlook. Unless the index decisively breaches 24,850, bulls are expected to hold the upper hand. For now, a “buy-on-dips” strategy remains the most prudent approach, with traders watching closely for a breakout above 25,150 to confirm the next leg of upside momentum. L&T, Bajaj Finance, M&M, Jio Financial Services, and Cipla were the top gainers on the Nifty. SBI Life Insurance, Grasim, Hero MotoCorp, Asian Paints, and HCL Tech were the major laggards.

Q1FY26 operating revenue surged 55% YoY to ₹3,131.7 cr, driven by strong performance in the Wind Turbine Generator (WTG) segment, which delivered 444 MW, marking a 62% YoY increase. OMS division posted a modest 10% YoY revenue growth for the quarter, while the Forging division surged 60% YoY to ₹146.49 cr. Suzlon’s share in Forging rose from 40% to 62%, driven by strong order execution. Gross profit rose 58% YoY, even as raw material costs jumped 85%, driven by effective price pass-through strategies that helped maintain profitability. Higher capacity utilization in the WTG and forging business, led to stronger operating leverage. As a result, EBITDA reached ₹599.07 cr, with a margin expansion of 82.3 bps. Profit before tax (PBT) grew 52% YoY to ₹459.23 cr. However, a ₹134 cr deferred tax charge led to higher tax expenses, moderating the growth in profit after tax (PAT), which stood at ₹324.32 cr, up 7% YoY over a high base. Outlook Suzlon’s ALMM compliance and backward integration offer a strong competitive moat, but sustaining margin discipline remains key to preserving pricing power. Factoring in execution risks, we revise our valuation multiple to 35x (from 38x earlier) FY27E EPS of ₹2.2 to arrive at a target price of ₹75, upgrading our rating to a BUY recommendation.

At 8:10 am, the Gift Nifty slipped 80 points, or 0.32 percent, to 25,041, hinting at a softer start for Dalal Street on Friday, August 22. Indices gained on Thursday, lifted by pharma, oil & gas and banking stocks. The midcap and smallcap index, however, broke their three-day rally to end lower, while weakness in autos, FMCG and PSU banks also capped the upside. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Foreign investors (FIIs/FPIs) pumped Rs 1,247 crore into Indian equities on Thursday, August 21. At the same time, domestic institutional investors (DIIs) sustained their support with net purchases of Rs 2,546 crore, according to provisional exchange data. Here are the important levels to watch out for in today’s session. Nifty’s broader structure remains constructive, with higher lows indicating persistent buying interest. The near-equal positioning of both call and put writers highlights the possibility of a consolidation phase, but a sustained move above 25,150 could unlock the next leg higher towards 25,250, likely forcing call writers into short covering. Support zones have shifted higher, with 24,850–25,000 now emerging as the key demand area. Firm positioning by put writers at lower strikes further strengthens the positive outlook.

For now, a “buy-on-dips” strategy remains the most prudent approach, with traders watching closely for a breakout above 25,150 to confirm the next leg of upside momentum. “Nifty Bank index continues to struggle for strong directional momentum, with leading banking heavyweights yet to exhibit sustained strength. The immediate hurdle lies in the 55,800–56,000 zone, and only a decisive breakout above this band could unleash bullish momentum, powered by short covering. On the downside, dips toward 55,500 remain attractive accumulation opportunities, supported by firm put writing at lower strikes” Dhupesh Dhameja of SAMCO Securities said. “However, a breach below 55,450 would be an early sign of weakness, opening the doors for a slide toward the 55,000 mark. Until then, sideways movement is expected to dominate”, he added. India VIX slipped 3.50 percent to settle at 11.37. Despite lingering global uncertainties, volatility remains subdued, hinting at a consolidation phase rather than sharp corrections. The muted VIX reading underscores cautious optimism among market participants, with no signs of heightened fear. The Put-Call Ratio (PCR) has eased slightly from 1.34 to 1.01, yet continues to reflect the dominance of put writers and a bullish-to-sideways sentiment in the market.

Around 1,381 shares declined compared to 1,350 advancing shares on the NSE. Overall, the trend remains favourable for bulls, despite the likelihood of intermittent consolidation. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Jay Mehta, Technical Research at JM Financial Services Afcons Infrastructure | CMP: Rs 427.8 Afcons Infrastructure had been trading in a descending triangle pattern since March 2025, hitting a low of around Rs 398 post-listing. It retested this level on April 7 and recently experienced a false breakdown below it on July 29, forming a hammer candlestick. The stock has now broken out above the triangle pattern, with an upside Tasuki candlestick pattern observed recently. Volume has increased positively in the past few sessions, with over 60% average delivery volume. The price is trading above its 20- and 50-day EMAs, and the price action aligns with RSI, showing a higher high and higher low structure in the short-to-medium term. Momentum indicators support a bullish outlook. The ADX trend indicator indicates fading bearish momentum, with bullish strength increasing as DMI+ trades above DMI- and ADX trends upward. A break above Rs 447 could accelerate the rally. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 465, Rs 484 Stop-Loss: Rs 405 Avenue Supermarts | CMP: Rs 4,691.9 DMart had been in a triangular consolidation pattern since April 2025, with below-average volume indicating an accumulation phase. On August 18, it broke out above the pattern with a breakaway gap, signaling renewed buying interest. The price is trading above all key EMAs, and the breakout is backed by positive volume buildup. Momentum indicators reflect a bullish bias, supporting an upward trend toward Rs 4,900 and Rs 5,166. A minor correction to the Rs 4,440–4,550 support zone could offer a buying opportunity. The ADX trend indicator suggests continued bullish momentum, with DMI+ trading above DMI-. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 4,900, Rs 5,166 Stop-Loss: Rs 4,126 Can Fin Homes | CMP: Rs 782.1 After correcting from a swing high of Rs 826, Can Fin Homes formed a base near its 200EMA, consolidating in a tight range for about 14 days. It recently broke out above this range with a surge in positive volume and strong delivery volume in recent sessions. The price is now trading above all key EMAs, which should act as support during minor dips. Momentum indicators support a bullish bias, with RSI trading above 50 and the MACD histogram rising. The ADX trend indicator shows fading prior bearish momentum, with bullish strength increasing as DMI+ trades above DMI-. Also, when comparing the relative move of peers in the housing finance space, Can Fin Homes is showing good relative strength. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 820, Rs 850 Stop-Loss: Rs 750 Mandar Bhojane, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst at Choice Broking Radico Khaitan | CMP: Rs 2,894.8 Radico Khaitan is consolidating just above its breakout level, indicating strength and the potential for a fresh breakout. The move is supported by strong volume participation, reflecting rising bullish interest. A decisive close above Rs 2,900 would confirm the breakout and could pave the way for a fresh upside rally. On the downside, immediate support is placed at Rs 2,850, which also acts as a strong accumulation zone for traders looking to enter on dips. The RSI stands at 62.34 and is trending upward, signaling improving momentum and increasing buying pressure. From a risk–reward perspective, traders may consider keeping a stop-loss at Rs 2,785 to manage downside risk. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,100, Rs 3,200 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,785 Swiggy | CMP: Rs 435.7 Swiggy has given a decisive breakout from a Cup and Handle formation on the daily chart, supported by strong volumes. This indicates that bulls are regaining control and a trend shift is already underway. The momentum outlook remains positive, with the RSI at 67.62 and trending upward, signaling growing strength while still staying below the overbought zone. The Rs 425 level is acting as a strong base and offers a buy-on-dips opportunity for traders. With price action holding above the breakout zone, the stock looks poised for further upside. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 505, Rs 540 Stop-Loss: Rs 407.5 Cipla | CMP: Rs 1,592.8 Cipla has recently broken out of a Symmetrical Triangle pattern on the daily chart. The breakout was backed by a strong bullish candle along with rising volumes, indicating renewed buying interest and a potential shift in trend in favour of the bulls. This price action highlights strength and the possibility of further upside in the stock. On the momentum front, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is placed at 65.9 and trending upward, suggesting growing bullish momentum. The Rs 1,570 level now serves as a strong support zone and could act as a buy-on-dips opportunity for positional traders. Sustaining above the breakout level with continued volume participation would likely open the door for higher levels in the coming sessions. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,700, Rs 1,790 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,525 Om Mehra, Technical Research Analyst at Samco Securities Dr Reddy's Laboratories | CMP: Rs 1,276.6 Dr Reddy’s Laboratories advanced in the latest session, breaking past the falling trendline resistance and closing above both the 20-SMA (Rs 1,245) and 50-SMA (Rs 1,270). This breakout from the recent consolidation phase suggests the stock is attempting to reverse its corrective trend. The daily RSI has improved to 58, indicating strengthening momentum with further scope before entering overbought territory. The MACD has turned positive, supported by a rising histogram, confirming that the short-term bias has tilted in favour of the bulls. The stock has formed a strong bullish candle on the daily chart backed by decent volumes, and is comfortably holding above the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement. On the downside, support is well-defined at Rs 1,255, aligned with the 50-SMA. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,345 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,245 Caplin Point Laboratories | CMP: Rs 2,211.10 Caplin Point Labs advanced 4.25% in the latest session, forming a strong bullish engulfing candle on the daily chart and decisively breaking out from a prolonged consolidation phase. The breakout was supported by a notable rise in volumes and followed weeks of sideways price action, where the stock had been coiling within a broad range. This move now signals a shift in momentum toward sustained upside. The daily RSI has improved to 62, confirming strengthening momentum while still leaving room before entering overbought territory. The MACD remains positive, while the hourly chart displays a higher high formation. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,320 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,140 Cummins India | CMP: Rs 3,886.30 Cummins India has staged a breakout from a well-defined saucer pattern, overcoming the prolonged resistance zone that had repeatedly capped the stock’s up move in recent months. This breakout is supported by a sequence of higher highs and higher lows, underscoring the strength of the ongoing uptrend. The stock continues to trade comfortably above its key moving averages, which are firmly sloping upward, providing a solid base for continuation. The RSI has climbed to 74, reflecting robust bullish momentum, though it is approaching overbought territory, which may invite brief consolidation phases. The MACD remains in positive territory with a widening histogram, confirming trend acceleration. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 4,220 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,750 Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.
