Stocks finish week higher; Wall Street at record highs,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/stocks-finish-week-higher-wall-street-at-record-highs-13562587.html,"Global stocks rose in choppy trading on Friday, on track for a weekly gain, driven by positive sentiment on Wall Street following key central bank decisions. The Federal Reserve cut U.S. interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday, the first easing since December, while Norway and Canada also cut rates. On Wall Street, all three indexes closed at record highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.37% to 46,315.27, the S&P 500 advanced 0.49% to 6,664.36, and the Nasdaq Composite firmed 0.72% to 22,631.48. All three also hit record highs the day before. European shares finished down 0.16%, and for the week were down 0.13%. Japan's Nikkei fell 0.57% after the Bank of Japan decided to start selling its holdings of risky assets. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe hit a fresh record high of 982.29, adding nearly 1% for the week. Investors are betting that central bank rate cuts will boost stocks further. ""The market for the past several weeks has all been focused on and relying on the Fed meeting and the Fed's decision, and there was enough in the decision to leave everyone just slightly disappointed though basically satisfied,"" said Michael Farr, chief executive of investment advisory firm Farr, Miller & Washington in Washington. The Fed stopped short of endorsing market expectations for a clear string of rate cuts, emphasizing a meeting-by-meeting, data-dependent approach. The Fed's tone, along with the wide range of views within the U.S. central bank, disappointed some investors, who had hoped the stock market would be boosted by a rapid shift to lower rates, analysts said. ""Markets have done exceptionally well and now markets are looking for the next driver or the next bit of news,"" Farr said. ""I think as we probably get into earnings season in October, those reports will be more important than ever because we need to see and the Fed needs to see if tariffs are indeed making their way into bottom-line profits."" The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes rose 2.5 basis points to 4.129%. The 2-year note yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations for the Fed, rose 0.6 basis points to 3.574%. ""The short-term momentum is clearly higher and we are playing the market to the upside because that's what the short-term momentum is telling you,"" said Bill Strazzullo, partner and chief market strategist at Bell Curve Trading in Boston. ""But I think it's a lot more complicated now because the Fed clearly has chosen to err on the side of the weaker labor market so that's talking about more rate cuts."" Following their first call in three months, U.S. President Donald Trump said he and Chinese President Xi Jinping made progress on a TikTok agreement and would meet face-to-face in six weeks in South Korea to discuss trade, illicit drugs and Russia's war in Ukraine. A stopgap spending bill that would avert an October 1 government shutdown fell short in the U.S. Senate on Friday. The bill had been passed by the House of Representatives. The U.S. dollar index rose for a third straight session, up 0.33% to 97.67, but was still set to notch a third straight week of losses. The dollar strengthened 0.4% to 0.795 against the Swiss franc , but was down 0.03% to 147.97 against the Japanese yen . The euro fell 0.35% against the dollar to $1.1745. The British pound fell 0.64% to $1.3467 . The Bank of England kept rates on hold on Thursday, but slowed the pace at which it is unloading the government bonds it purchased in previous crises. Oil prices settled lower as traders' worries about fuel demand outweighed the typical boost from a U.S. rate cut. Brent crude futures fell 1.1% to settle at $66.68 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures lost 1.4%, to $62.68. Gold was up 1.04% at $3,681.79, notching its fifth straight week of gains."

Brokerages step up 'Buy' calls on Adani Group stocks since Hindenburg saga,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/brokerages-step-up-buy-calls-on-adani-group-stocks-since-hindenburg-saga-13560285.html,"Adani Group stocks lit up Dalal Street on September 19, surging as much as 13 percent, after the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) cleared Gautam Adani and his diversified conglomerate of the stock manipulation charges levelled by US-based short-seller Hindenburg Research. The regulator’s detailed orders found no evidence of funds being routed through related parties to inflate the group’s listed companies. The ruling marks the closure of a 3-year cloud of allegations that had wiped out over $100 billion in market value at the trough. With the regulatory overhang finally lifted, brokerages are warming up to the Adani pack once again, with “buy” ratings steadily rising across group companies. Bloomberg data showed a marked change in analyst sentiment since 2023. Adani Enterprises now enjoys 3 “buy” calls compared to just 1 at the end of March last year. Adani Power’s tally has risen from 1 to 5, Adani Total Gas has secured its 1 “buy” call, while Adani Green Energy has jumped from 0 to 6. Adani Energy Solutions has climbed from 1 to 8, and Ambuja Cements has notched up 36 bullish calls, versus 27 earlier. Analysts attribute this shift to a cocktail of factors: sharp corrections in stock prices, more reasonable valuations, and ambitious expansion plans that are beginning to crystalise into execution. ALSO READ: Sebi's clean chit lifts Adani Group stocks, paves way for fresh re-rating Adani Enterprises Elara Capital highlights airports as the crown jewel in Adani Enterprises’ portfolio. Passenger traffic already touched 94 million in FY25 and is poised to cross 100 million in FY26, aided by the launch of Navi Mumbai Airport in September 2025. A steep 30–35 percent tariff hike at Mumbai Airport will begin flowing into EBITDA from this quarter, providing a significant profitability kicker. Management has confirmed that airports will be the first business to be demerged and listed by FY27–28, unlocking major shareholder value. Beyond airports, the roads portfolio is gaining traction, with 14 projects under management, six operational and eight nearing completion. Meanwhile, the data centre business is evolving into a high-margin, annuity-style vertical anchored by hyperscale contracts. With 50 MW already live in Hyderabad and Chennai, 200–300 MW contracted, and a roadmap of one facility every quarter from FY26, the company is targeting 150 MW of operational capacity by September 2026 and scaling to 1 GW by FY27. Currently, the stock carries 3 “buy” ratings and a consensus target price of Rs 3,000, implying upside of nearly 20 percent. Adani Power Morgan Stanley has initiated coverage on Adani Power with an “overweight” rating and a target price of Rs 818, suggesting upside of 30 percent. The brokerage calls the company one of India’s most remarkable corporate turnaround stories, given its resolution of regulatory hurdles and multiple value-accretive acquisitions. Adani Power is India’s largest independent power producer and the second-largest overall after NTPC, with an 8 percent share in both coal capacity and generation. Analysts forecast market share to reach 15 percent by FY32, supported by an expansion from 18.15 GW in Q1FY26 to 41.9 GW by FY32. Post this expansion, Morgan Stanley projects EBITDA of Rs 67,200 crore by FY33, representing a 17 percent CAGR over FY22–33. Net debt is forecast to peak at Rs 1.32 lakh crore by FY31, with leverage manageable at 3.2x net debt-to-EBITDA at the peak. Importantly, 60–65 percent of the Rs 2.27 lakh crore capex pipeline is expected to be funded through internal accruals. Currently, the stock has 5 “buy” ratings and a consensus target price of Rs 704. Adani Ports and SEZ Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (APSEZ) has evolved from a pure-play port operator into a fully integrated transport and logistics platform. With capacity expansions, transshipment hub operations kicking off, and steady cargo growth, the company is well-placed for sustained outperformance. Motilal Oswal estimates revenue, EBITDA, and PAT CAGR of 16, 16, and 21 percent, respectively, between FY25–27, driven by cargo growth of around 10 percent annually. Cargo volumes are targeted at 505–515 MMT in FY26. Analysts reiterate a “buy” rating with a target price of Rs 1,700. Currently, the stock has 21 ""buy"" calls and 1 ""hold"" rating, with consensus price target of Rs 1,708, implying 18 percent upside potential. Adani Green Energy Jefferies remains bullish on Adani Green, reiterating a “buy” rating with a target price of Rs 1,300. Management has outlined aggressive plans to scale capacity from 14 GW in FY25 to 50 GW by 2030 translating to a 3.5x expansion. The company guided for 5 GW capacity addition in FY26, with Jefferies estimating 4.5 GW in FY26 and 6.3 GW in FY27. Importantly, net debt-to-EBITDA metrics are improving, while valuations remain compelling at a 63 percent discount to their January 2023 peak forward EV/EBITDA multiples. Currently, the stock enjoys 6 ""buy"" calls and 1 ""sell"" rating, with consensus price target of Rs 1,240, implying upside potential of 20 percent. Adani Total Gas Adani Total Gas Ltd (ATGL) remains primarily focused on city gas distribution (CGD), supplying natural gas to households, commercial establishments, industries, and the transport segment. The company has recently diversified into biogas production and electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure, aligning itself with India’s long-term clean energy transition. To fund its ambitions, ATGL is targeting capex of Rs 15,000–20,000 crore over the next decade, which includes expansion of its CGD footprint and scaling its EV charging and biogas ventures. This long pipeline of investments is expected to drive financial acceleration once new assets come onstream. Currently, the stock carries just one “buy” call on the Street. ACC ACC, part of the Adani cement portfolio, has earmarked Rs 225–300 crore for FY26 capex, representing 25–30 percent of the group’s spend. Investments are aimed at regional capacity additions, operational efficiencies, and sustainability-linked initiatives. Cement demand rose 4 percent year-on-year in Q1FY26, led by infrastructure build-out and resilient housing activity. On this backdrop, management has raised its FY26 volume growth guidance to 7–8 percent, up from 6–7 percent earlier. Analysts at Deven Choksey Research believe the pre-election infrastructure push, combined with strong policy visibility, sets the stage for sustained growth in the second half of FY26. The stock currently has 25 “buy” calls, 11 “hold” and six “sell” ratings, with a consensus target price of Rs 2,127, implying an upside potential of 13 percent. Ambuja Cements Ambuja Cements has guided for strong demand and pricing discipline in FY26, expecting cement consumption to rise seven–8 percent year-on-year, versus earlier guidance of 6–7 percent. Pricing trends already showed improvement in Q1, and management has reiterated its focus on strict price discipline to protect margins. On the cost front, the company is targeting a reduction of Rs 530 per ton, with around 35–40 percent of the savings already achieved. Capacity expansion also remains on track, with current grinding capacity at 104.5 MTPA. An additional 13 MTPA will be commissioned over the remaining nine months of FY26, reinforcing growth visibility. Ambuja Cements enjoys 16 “buy” calls, 7 “hold” and 3 “sell” ratings, with a consensus target price of Rs 652 per share.

"IT stocks drop up to 2%, snap three-day gaining streak on profit booking after Fed rate cut-led rise",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/it-stocks-drop-up-to-2-snap-three-day-gaining-streak-on-profit-booking-after-fed-rate-cut-led-rise-13560570.html,"The shares of IT companies dropped in trade on September 19 as investors may have resorted to profit booking at elevated levels. The fall in the share prices pushed the Nifty IT index down around 1 percent to 36,385 in the afternoon. The sectoral index is currently the top loser on the market today. It has now snapped a three-day gaining streak. HCL Tech shares were the top loser on the index, dropping nearly 2 percent to trade at Rs 1,468.70 apiece. Coforge and OFSS shares fell around 1.4 percent each. Heavyweight Infosys shares fell more than 1 percent, dragging down the index. Persistent Systems shares also declined more than 1 percent. Wipro, Mphasis and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) shares were down around 1 percent. LTIMindtree and Tech Mahindra shares were trading in the red with marginal losses. All constituents of the index are currently in red, as seen as 1 pm. The Nifty IT index had earlier jumped as much as 2 percent on September 18 after US Federal Reserve slashed its interest rate by 25 basis points. The index then pared some gains to close nearly 1 percent higher at 36750.25. US Fed cuts rates by 25 bps: The US Federal Reserve on September 17 cut its benchmark interest rate by 25 bps to 4-4.25 percent, in line with analyst expectations. Notably, this marked the first rate cut announced by the American central bank since Donald Trump began his second term as the President of the United States. More rate cuts on the way? Policymakers hinted at two more quarter-point cuts this year (50 bps in total), plus one cut in 2026 and another in 2027. One official projected a whopping 125 bps of easing by December. In its statement, the US Fed said ""recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity moderated in the first half of the year. Job gains have slowed, and the unemployment rate has edged up but remains low. Inflation has moved up and remains somewhat elevated."" It added that ""downside risks to employment have risen"", prompting the shift in policy. Why IT stocks surged after Fed's rate cut: A rate cut in the US is expected to increase the discretionary spending limit, which in turn benefits IT companies which derive a significant portion of their revenue from the North American market. What analysts say? ""The FED continues to face a delicate balancing act following a 0.25% rate cut at its latest meeting in September. Whilst the rate cut was expected, it is of more note to listen to what Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in the Press Conference afterwards, where he mentioned that policy decisions remain challenging, and the committee members are still split on further rate cuts, with 10 out of 19 policy makers seeing two or more rate cuts this year,"" said Ross Maxwell, Global Strategy Lead at VT Markets. ""Financial markets are likely to welcome the rate cut in the near term, as lower borrowing costs ease pressure on households and businesses. Equity markets may see short-term support, though bond yields could remain volatile as investors weigh growth concerns against inflation risks,"" he added.

Sebi's clean chit sends the market value of Adani stocks higher by $8.5 billion in a day,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sebi-s-clean-chit-lifts-adani-group-stocks-paves-way-for-fresh-re-rating-13560236.html,"Sebi’s clean chit to Gautam Adani and group companies triggered a wave of buying that sent shares soaring to their best day in four months on September 19. All group stocks rallied to add $8.5 billion to the total market capitalisation, taking it past $158 billion, which is still below the high of $235 billion seen on the eve of Hindenburg’s report, released in January 2023. For a conglomerate that has been under a dark cloud since Hindenburg Research dropped its explosive short-seller note in early 2023, the verdict comes as a relief. Market experts said the ruling not only eases domestic regulatory anxieties, kindling hopes of a broader re-rating notwithstanding pending verdicts around other allegations both by Sebi and US SEC. The Sebi orders issued on September pertain only to allegations around related party transactions. Sebi verdict around violation or Minimum Public Shareholding in certain group companies and FPI ownership is still pending. Sebi's clean chit lifts mood Shares of Adani Enterprises, Adani Power, Adani Green Energy, Adani Total Gas, Adani Ports, and AWL Agri Business ended up to 8 percent higher at close, on September 19. Yet the journey since the Hindenburg saga has been anything but smooth. While most of the group’s listed firms remain deep in the red, with losses of up to 84 percent from their peaks, a couple of outliers, notably Adani Ports and Adani Power have staged a remarkable rebound, chalking up gains of more than 130 percent. For Aishvarya Dadheech of Fident Asset Management, the clean chit is more than symbolic. He noted that this is the second time Sebi has offered a prima facie clearance, underscoring how each regulatory hurdle crossed adds to investor confidence. According to him, Adani stocks had been underperforming in recent weeks despite an improving broader market; this verdict gave them the momentum to catch up, and he expects the gains to sustain. Vinit Bolinjkar of Ventura Securities echoed that sentiment, stressing that after three years of scrutiny, Sebi’s orders strengthen confidence and also prepare the ground for additional regulatory clearances both locally and abroad. Retail investors, mutual funds hold the fort The tide, however, seems to be turning in the markets. Sebi’s clean chit, combined with the group’s record-high operating performance in the first quarter of FY26, has prompted brokerages to revise their stance. Bloomberg data showed Adani Enterprises now enjoys 3 “buy” calls, up from just 1 at the end of March 2023. Adani Power’s tally has also risen from 1 to 5, Adani Total Gas from 0 to 1, Adani Green from 0 to 6, Adani Energy from 1 to 8, and Ambuja Cements from 27 to 36. ALSO READ: Brokerages step up 'Buy' calls on Adani Group stocks since Hindenburg saga One factor that has helped sentiment in the stock is the rising willingness among domestic mutual funds to buy the stock. While foreign institutional investors steadily pared exposure between December 2022 and June 2025, local funds and retail participants filled the gap. Brokerages are also beginning to call out opportunities. Ventura’s Bolinjkar was bullish on Adani Green Energy, Adani Enterprises and Adani Total Gas as long-term plays, projecting 20–25 percent upside. He was especially positive on Adani Green’s plan to ramp capacity from 15 GW to 50 GW over five years, and pointed to Adani Enterprises’ role as an incubator for growth businesses in defence, airports and new age hydrogen. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley initiated coverage on Adani Power with an “overweight” rating and a target of Rs 818, seeing 30 percent upside, citing a successful corporate turnaround. Motilal Oswal added its weight behind Adani Ports, setting a Rs 1,700 target, nearly 20 percent higher on expectations of a robust CAGR in revenue, EBITDA and profit through FY25–27.

"Post-Hindenburg, FIIs cut stakes as domestic investors absorb Adani sell-off",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/post-hindenburg-fiis-cut-stakes-as-domestic-investors-absorb-adani-sell-off-13560296.html,"Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have pared holdings in Adani Group companies since the January 2023 Hindenburg Research report, even as domestic investors—mutual funds and retail players—absorbed much of the selling. Adani Enterprises saw the sharpest pullback, with FII stakes falling to 11.55% in the June 2025 quarter from 15.39% in December 2022. Adani Total Gas and Adani Green Energy also saw exits, with holdings cut to 13% and 11.58% from 17.25% and 15.14%, respectively. ACC recorded the steepest reduction, with FII ownership dropping to 4.66% from 11.95%. Adani Energy Solutions and Ambuja Cement also saw cuts of nearly 350 basis points, while Adani Power and Adani Ports & SEZ witnessed relatively smaller trims of 25–40 bps. Domestic institutions moved in aggressively. Mutual funds lifted stakes in Adani Enterprises and Adani Green Energy by 150 bps and 140 bps, respectively. Inflows also went into Adani Ports & SEZ and Ambuja Cement, though the biggest MF additions were in ACC (385 bps), Adani Energy Solutions (300 bps), and Adani Power (175 bps). Retail investors mirrored the trend, with the sharpest increases in Adani Total Gas (380 bps), Adani Green Energy (225 bps), Adani Energy Solutions (220 bps), and ACC (186 bps). Adani Enterprises and Adani Ports & SEZ saw smaller additions of around 100 bps, while Adani Power and Ambuja Cement bucked the trend, witnessing retail stake reductions of 90 bps. The shake-up followed Hindenburg’s allegations that the group routed funds via offshore shell entities to inflate stock prices, triggering a rout that at its trough wiped out over ₹8.3 lakh crore in market value. Relief came on September 19 when SEBI cleared Gautam Adani and the group, saying it found no evidence of stock manipulation, insider trading, or related-party misuse. The orders align with a Supreme Court-appointed expert panel’s earlier findings of no prima facie wrongdoing. The clean chit marks a step forward as the ports-to-power conglomerate seeks to restore investor confidence after months of regulatory scrutiny and speculation."

Buy Prince Pipes and Fittings; target of Rs 440: Motilal Oswal,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-prince-pipes-and-fittings-target-of-rs-440-motilal-oswal-2-13560066.html,"Motilal Oswal's research report on Prince Pipes and Fittings Prince Pipes and Fittings (PRINCPIP) hosted an analyst meet on 18th Sep’25, where it highlighted the current demand-supply and pricing scenarios in the PVC pipes industry. The PVC pipes market remains under pressure due to volatile PVC prices and a weak demand environment. In addition, the delay in the implementation of anti-dumping duty (ADD) has created uncertainty within channel partners, putting pressure on the PVC prices market domestically. Given that 2Q is seasonally weak, the company anticipates a healthy demand outlook in 2HFY26, thereby maintaining its guidance for FY26. Outlook We expect ~12% volume CAGR over FY25-28 with margin expansion, as operating leverage and product mix benefits play out. Structural demand drivers such as government housing schemes, plumbing upgrades, and GST rationalization should provide tailwinds in 2HFY26 and beyond. We maintain BUY with a TP of INR440 (based on 30x FY27E EPS).

This will be the fourth hydro asset for JSW Energy and a 'significant addition' to its hydel portfolio in Himachal Pradesh, the company added. Domestic Power Capacity India’s total installed power capacity has reached 485 GW, with 19.9 GW added in Q1FY26 alone. This addition has taken India's clean energy capacity to 50%, achieving its Paris Agreement target five years ahead of schedule, with non-fossil fuel capacity of 243 GW.

Adani Group stocks higher by up to 10% as investors welcome Sebi clean chit,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/adani-enterprises-adani-power-other-group-stocks-in-focus-as-it-gets-sebi-s-clean-chit-in-hindenburg-case-13559233.html,"Shares of Adani Group companies including Adani Enterprises, Adani Power, Adani Green Energy, Adani Total Gas surged up to 10 percent on September 19 after regulatory Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) gave the conglomerate and its founder, Gautam Adani, a clean chit in the stock manipulation case triggered by US-based short seller Hindenburg Research. What Sebi said In two detailed orders, SEBI said its investigation found no evidence that the group routed funds through related parties to inflate share prices of its listed entities. Allegations of insider trading, market manipulation, and violations of public shareholding norms were deemed unsubstantiated after months of inquiry. Hindenburg Research, which has since shut down operations, released a report in January 2023 alleging that Adani Group used three firms: Adicorp Enterprises Pvt Ltd, Milestone Tradelinks Pvt Ltd, and Rehvar Infrastructure Pvt Ltd as conduits to channel funds into Adani Enterprises and Adani Power. The report had sparked a massive selloff, erasing more than $100 billion in market value at its lowest point. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog However, SEBI board member Kamlesh C Varshney clarified in the orders that transactions involving these three firms did not qualify as related-party dealings under the rules at that time, and hence did not breach disclosure requirements. “After a thorough investigation, SEBI has concluded there is no basis to hold the Adani entities or their executives liable or to impose penalties,” the regulator said. ALSO READ: SEBI disposes of proceedings against Adani Group firms, Gautam Adani; finds no merit in Hindenburg allegations The ruling provides significant relief to the ports-to-power conglomerate, which had been under the scanner for months amid regulatory scrutiny and market speculation. A Supreme Court-appointed expert committee had earlier arrived at a similar conclusion, noting no prima facie evidence of wrongdoing. Morgan Stanley initiates ""overweight"" call on Adani Power Global brokerage firm Morgan Stanley initiated ""overweight"" rating on Adani Power and shared target price of Rs 818, implying upside potential of 30 percent. Analysts said that the company is a strong example of a corporate turnaround in India. Most of the regulatory issues have been resolved and value accretive acquisitions have been completed. The brokerage firm believes that the company is set to deliver strong earnings growth from timely projects and new PPAs. Capacity and EBITDA forecast to rise 2.5x and 3x by FY33. Despite the overhang, Adani Group shares have delivered a mixed performance in 2025. So far this year, shares of Adani Enterprises, Adani Green Energy, and Adani Total Gas have declined by as much as 19 percent, while Adani Ports and Adani Power have gained up to 19 percent.

Asian stocks rise as global gauge hits new peak,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/asian-stocks-rise-as-global-gauge-hits-new-peak-13558776.html,"Asian stocks were on the cusp of an intraday record high after US and global equity benchmarks hit fresh peaks, as the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate cut bolstered sentiment. Stocks in Japan and Australia opened higher while South Korea was flat. The S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Russell 2000 small-cap index all closed together at fresh highs for the first time since November 2021. An MSCI index of global stocks also closed at a record in a sign of robust risk appetite. The yen was steady after Japan’s consumer inflation slowed abruptly, with the Bank of Japan’s rate decision due later on Friday. The upbeat mood in stocks reflected expectations for further rate cuts alongside an economy and jobs market that for now remain relatively resilient. Thursday’s data showed jobless claims dropped by the most in nearly four years, suggesting US companies are still holding onto workers. “The Fed is cutting interest rates during a time when stocks are at record highs and the economy is still growing,” said Robert Schein at Blanke Schein Wealth Management. “This dynamic is bullish for stocks.” Worries have been mounting for weeks that the S&P 500’s push to record after record risks becoming a bubble, with the index’s swollen valuation cited most often as a cause for concern. Critics point to the tech sector’s outsize influence on this year’s gain, with just five stocks, all megacap tech firms, driving about half of the advance. But a closer look shows tech giants have largely justified their elevated valuations with profit growth. “Investors have happily bought every dip, largely thanks to AI-driven enthusiasm and consistently strong results from big tech,” said Fawad Razaqzada at City Index and Forex.com. “The concern is that if tech momentum cools, the rest of the market may struggle to justify current valuations.” That leaves the rally vulnerable if investor confidence wavers, putting the S&P 500 forecast on a more cautious stance, he noted. “Our base case remains that the US economy will remain resilient and that it is unlikely to spiral into a recession,” said David Lefkowitz at UBS Global Wealth Management. “We therefore believe stocks are poised for further gains.” On the BOJ, economists polled by Bloomberg anticipate the central bank will leave its target interest rate unchanged at 0.5%. BOJ watchers will be looking for clues as to the likelihood of a move next month or in December."
"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Kotak Mahindra Bank, Aadhar Housing, Kansai Nerolac, Kfin Tech, Mankind Pharma, Zydus Life, and others on September 19?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-kotak-mahindra-bank-aadhar-housing-kansai-nerolac-kfin-tech-mankind-pharma-zydus-life-and-others-on-september-19-13558732.html,"Equity benchmarks extended their winning streak on September 18, with the Nifty closing above 25,400 for the first time since July 9, but the market breadth was slightly weak. About 1,436 shares saw selling pressure compared to 1,340 rising shares on the NSE. The market may see some consolidation, but overall, the mood remains bullish. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Jay Mehta, Technical Research at JM Financial Services Amara Raja Energy & Mobility | CMP: Rs 1,031 Amara Raja Energy & Mobility is displaying positive price action. The stock recently broke out of a descending channel with a significant increase in volume. This upward momentum is backed by an upward-sloping EMA and a bullish crossover between short- and medium-term EMAs. The convergence of EMAs near Rs 1,000 has established a strong support base. The stock has also reclaimed its position above the 200 EMA and is consolidating around that level. A decisive move above Rs 1,060 would likely fuel a further rally. Both the RSI and MACD are in bullish territory. A key positive sign is the high volume on green candles and very low volume on red candles, which indicates healthy accumulation. The stock shows high relative strength compared to the Nifty and Nifty 500. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,120, Rs 1,200 Stop-Loss: Rs 980 Aadhar Housing Finance | CMP: Rs 538.55 Aadhar Housing Finance is demonstrating significant bullish strength with a robust price structure. The stock broke out of a prolonged triangular consolidation at Rs 480 on July 15, rising to Rs 537.5. After a period of tighter consolidation, it has recently broken out again, reaching a near all-time high with strong volume, which confirms the move. The Bollinger Bands are widening at the breakout, suggesting increasing volatility. Momentum indicators support a continued bullish bias. The price is trading above all key EMAs, with the 20 and 50 EMAs providing strong support, aligning with the bullish candlesticks from September 12 and 16. The stock’s high relative strength compared to the Nifty and Nifty 500 further strengthens its positive outlook. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 580, Rs 600 Stop-Loss: Rs 485 Kansai Nerolac Paints | CMP: Rs 253.25 Kansai Nerolac, after trading in a descending channel since April 22, 2025, recently broke out on September 17. A significant volume build-up since August 11, accompanied by a high delivery percentage, suggests strong accumulation at lower levels. The price has reclaimed its position above the 200 EMA and is now trading above its short- and medium-term averages, which are converging near Rs 244 and will act as a strong base. Inside the channel, the stock formed a double bottom pattern with a positive divergence in the RSI, supporting the bullish trend. Both the RSI and MACD are in positive territory. The stock is also showing improved relative strength compared to the Nifty and Nifty 500. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 267, Rs 273 Stop-Loss: Rs 239 Hardik Matalia, Derivative Analyst at Choice Broking Kfin Technologies | CMP: Rs 1,144.8 Kfin Technologies has displayed strong bullish price action over the last three trading sessions. The stock has successfully broken out of a falling trendline, followed by a retest, which adds reliability to the breakout pattern. Notably, it has formed an inverse Head and Shoulders pattern and has decisively broken above the neckline — a classic bullish reversal structure. This breakout is accompanied by a significant increase in trading volume, indicating rising investor interest and strong market participation. Additionally, the stock has closed above key exponential moving averages — the 20, 50, and 200 EMA — providing a technical confluence that supports continued upward momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 58.93 and has shown a recent bullish crossover, confirming building positive momentum and healthy underlying strength. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,250 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,092 Bharat Petroleum Corporation | CMP: Rs 325.7 BPCL has successfully broken out of its trendline resistance zone and closed the previous session with positive momentum, which is supported by a notable surge in trading volume, indicating increased market participation and suggesting that the upward momentum may sustain in the near term. The stock has also managed to close above key exponential moving averages — the 20, 50, and 200 EMA — which further strengthens the bullish outlook and adds confluence to the ongoing upward move. Additionally, the stock has formed a double bottom pattern with strong support at the 200 EMA, further reinforcing the bullish sentiment. Furthermore, the RSI is currently at 59.66 and has shown a recent bullish crossover, confirming the positive momentum. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 360 Stop-Loss: Rs 310 Kotak Mahindra Bank | CMP: Rs 2,054.6 Kotak Mahindra Bank has exhibited strong bullish price action over the last three consecutive sessions. The stock is on the verge of an upside range breakout, supported by consistent volume buildup — a key indicator of strengthening buying interest. Notably, the stock has taken strong support near the Rs 1,920 level, evident from multiple wick rejections and sharp recovery from dips, which indicates strong demand at lower levels. Furthermore, it has successfully closed above critical exponential moving averages — the 20, 50, and 200 EMA — which creates a favourable technical setup and validates the underlying bullish sentiment. In addition to these bullish signals, the stock has managed to close above its previous swing high, reinforcing the continuation of the current uptrend.

This move comes after a prolonged consolidation phase around the Rs 2,500–2,600 zone, indicating that the stock has gathered strength to resume its upward momentum. A bullish crossover of the short-term moving averages lends further confirmation to the breakout. The RSI has climbed to 62, suggesting the momentum is improving. The MACD has generated a bullish crossover with green histogram bars, further highlighting the positive momentum. Volume participation picked up in the latest session, adding confirmation to the breakout. The breakout from the triangular consolidation suggests a potential trend continuation on the upside. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,780 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,560 Zydus Lifesciences | CMP: Rs 1,047.85 Over the past several weeks, Zydus Lifesciences has been carving out a constructive base with a series of higher lows, pointing to steady accumulation. The consolidation phase has narrowed into a horizontal resistance band near the current level, and a decisive close above this mark would confirm a breakout and extend the ongoing uptrend. The stock continues to trade above all the key moving averages. The RSI has improved to 67, maintaining a steady northward slope and signaling strengthening momentum. The MACD has also held in positive territory, while volumes have shown noticeable improvement during recent attempts to push higher, lending weight to the breakout possibility. The stock is extending its momentum, supported by an inverse head and shoulders breakout. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,100 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,015 NMDC | CMP: Rs 76.73 NMDC has sustained above the breakout level of Rs 75.30, showing follow-through strength after a prolonged consolidation. The stock is now trading firmly above all its key moving averages, which highlights the broader stability of the uptrend and the strong base formation underway. Momentum indicators continue to support this move. The RSI stands at 66 with a steady northward slope, while the MACD holds its positive crossover with supportive histogram bars, both reflecting ongoing strength. The rise in trading volume during the recent leg of the rally further validates the breakout. The sectoral momentum is evident, with the metal index advancing more than 8% in a month, lending additional confirmation to NMDC’s strength.

Dr. Agarwal’s says merger valuation structured through fair and transparent process,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/dr-agarwal-s-says-merger-valuation-structured-through-fair-and-transparent-process-13558119.html,"Dr. Agarwal’s Eye Hospital Ltd (AEHL) says its proposed merger with holding company Dr. Agarwal’s Health Care Ltd (AHCL) has been structured through a transparent process backed by independent evaluations. The move, aimed at creating a single listed entity, has drawn questions from some investors after AEHL’s stock fell 18% post-announcement. AEHL stock gained 0.58% to close at Rs. 4,680.35 on BSE on Thursday. AHCL stock rose 0.94% to end at Rs 443.70 on Thursday.Below are the excerpts of company's response to Moneycontrol questions. Could you walk us through the structure of the proposed merger?We’ve announced the merger of AEHL with AHCL to create a single listed entity. AHCL will issue shares to AEHL’s minority shareholders, while its existing stake in AEHL will be cancelled. Additionally, AEHL’s board has approved a Rs 70 crore preferential allotment to AHCL to fund its flagship Chennai facility. This infusion is independent of the merger and will be completed beforehand. What’s the strategic rationale behind this move?The merger simplifies our corporate structure, enhances operational and financial efficiency, and accelerates growth. AEHL shareholders gain access to AHCL’s pan-India network, a larger clinical talent pool, and a company with higher market capitalisation. For AHCL shareholders, it means streamlined governance and integrated operations. How is swap ratio determined?The swap ratio—23 AHCL shares (Re 1 face value) for every 2 AEHL shares (Rs 10 face value)—was based on independent valuations by PwC and Bansi Mehta & Co., using globally accepted methods and market price trends. Kotak Mahindra Capital and Motilal Oswal provided fairness opinions. The ratio implies a 15% premium over the one-month average price prior to the announcement. Can you elaborate on AEHL’s preferential issue and the need for additional capital? Would this preferential issue have any impact on the merger?To support growth for the subsidiary company, the Board of AEHL has also approved a preferential issue aggregating approximately Rs 70 crore, comprising 1,32,827 equity shares at an issue price of Rs 5,270 per share , aligned with the merger pricing. This capital infusion will further strengthen AEHL’s balance sheet and ensure a smooth transition. The preferential allotment is being undertaken for funding the construction of our flagship facility in Chennai. Since the capex requirement is immediate, we are simultaneously proceeding with the preferential allotment along with the Merger. The primary infusion will be completed ahead of the merger completion. What’s the expected timeline and post-merger shareholding?The merger should close in 12–14 months, subject to approvals. Post-merger, AEHL’s public shareholders will hold 4.6%, AHCL promoters 30.9%, and AHCL’s public shareholders 64.5%. How does this align with AHCL’s IPO promise?When AHCL listed earlier this year, we committed to consolidating operations within three years. This merger delivers on that promise and positions us for long-term growth with a simplified governance framework."
BofA on telecom: Brokerage expects two rounds of industry-wide tariff hikes,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/bofa-on-telecom-brokerage-expects-two-rounds-of-industry-wide-tariff-hikes-13557823.html,"Bank of America Securities in its latest note said that it expects Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio to benefit from the calm competitive environment, reducing capex-to-sales ratio and improving cash-flows. The firm reiterated 'Buy' rating on both the stocks. The brokerage however maintained its 'Underperform' rating on the shares of debt-ridden telecom company Vodafone Idea and Indus Towers, due to their unfavourable risk-reward ratio. It noted that Vodafone Idea continues to lose market share, making its fundamentals weak even with prospective relief. BofA Securities said that a near-term bounce in stocks cannot be ruled out if government provides any dues relief to the companies. It expects two rounds of industry-wide tariff hikes, following which average revenue per user (ARPU) will likely move in line with inflation. Early investment in network capacity, aggressive pricing, adoption of emerging technologies over the next five years will likely determine which telecom companies will lead the 2030 generative AI landscape, the international brokerage added. Bharti Airtel shares closed marginally higher in the green at Rs 1,480.75 apiece. Earlier during the day, the stock hit an intraday high of Rs 1,488.50 apiece. Reliance Industries shares also closed in the green at Rs 1,415 apiece. Vodafone Idea (Vi) shares closed more than 1.4 percent higher at Rs 7.88 apiece.

After a strong start, a mid-session profit booking erased most of the gains, however, amid final hour buying Nifty closed at 25,423.60, up 93.35 points or 0.37 percent and Sensex was up 320.25 points or 0.39 percent at 83,013.96.

Click to View More Outlook for September 19 Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets traded volatile on Thursday but managed to maintain the positive tone, continuing its prevailing trend. After a flat start, the Nifty index oscillated within a limited range in the first half however volatility in heavyweights in the latter half triggered sharp swings. Eventually, it closed near the day’s high at 25,423.60, up 0.37%. Sectoral trends remained mixed, with pharma, IT and financials edged higher while energy and realty ended on a muted note. The broader markets outperformed once again, with both midcap and smallcap indices rising nearly 0.5% each, reflecting strong participation across segments. The market’s upward momentum was underpinned primarily by the US Federal Reserve’s rate cut of 25 basis points, which boosted risk sentiment globally. Besides, the sentiment stayed constructive, supported by sustained domestic flows and rotational buying in key sectors. On the index front, we are now on the verge of testing the target zone 25,500 zone in Nifty, which could prompt some profit taking or consolidation in the index ahead. However, the favorable sentiment across the key sectors would keep the tone positive. We thus recommend focusing more on stock-specific opportunities now, preferring stocks where risk to reward is favorable. Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities The market rally continues, with the Nifty ending 93 points higher, while the Sensex was up by 320 points. Among sectors, Pharma and Healthcare indices gained over 1 percent, whereas intraday profit booking was seen in selective Defence stocks. Technically, after a gap-up open, the market witnessed some selling pressure at higher levels. However, the short-term outlook remains positive. For day traders, the higher bottom support is placed near 25,300/82700. We are of the view that as long as the market trades above this level, the bullish sentiment is likely to continue. On the higher side, 25,500/83300 would act as an immediate resistance zone for the bulls. A successful breakout above 25,500/83300 could push the market up to 25,600–25,625/83500-83600. On the flip side, if the market falls below 25,300/82700, the uptrend would become vulnerable. Below this level, traders may prefer to exit their long positions. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities Nifty remained volatile after a gap-up start, driven by a dovish Fed announcement. The short-term trend is likely to stay positive as the index is comfortably trading above its critical moving average. The daily RSI is in a bullish crossover and rising above the previous swing high, indicating strengthening momentum. In the near term, support is placed at 25,300 and 25,150. On the other hand, crucial resistance is seen at 25,500. A decisive move above this level could trigger a rally towards 26,000. Overall, a buy-on-dips strategy remains favorable in the current market scenario.

"MC Exclusive | Sunil Singhania: New-age firms face risk as competition chases market cap, not profits",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/mc-exclusive-sunil-singhania-new-age-firms-face-risk-as-competition-chases-market-cap-not-profits-13557516.html,"India’s highly valued firms may face a fresh set of risks as competition shifts from chasing profit pools to chasing market capitalisation, according to Sunil Singhania, founder of Abakkus Asset Manager. “Earlier competition used to come up to take a share of the profit,” he said on the Wealth Formula Podcast with N Mahalakshmi. “Now competition is coming up to take a share of the market cap, which is more dangerous. In these businesses the top two will take 80–90 percent market share.” Citing examples like Zomato, Nykaa and Paytm, Singhania said it remains difficult for valuation-focused investors like him to take large exposure in such high-multiple stocks. While he acknowledged their phenomenal growth rates, improving unit economics and a shift towards profitability, he noted that portfolios would not have 30–40% weight in such names. “On a forward basis, if you just take it to FY28 or FY29, many of these companies start to look like 30–40x PE as the growth could be 100%. So somewhere you’ll have to say India is not only traditional companies, it’s also 5–7% allocation to these new-age ones,” he said. Still, he flagged intense competition as a key risk. “If Zomato is at ₹3 lakh crore and Swiggy only at ₹2 lakh crore, another player might come up saying we can make $1–2 billion. That’s dangerous for both existing companies and investors,” he said. He drew parallels with the paints industry, where the aggregate profit pool is just ₹6,000–7,000 crore. Despite this, multiple players have entered, lured by the market leader’s high valuation. “The motivation is the market cap because profit pool is not very large,” Singhania said. He added that even consumer companies must adapt, as younger consumers are open to experimentation across personal care, apparel, and footwear. “The existing market leader will have to work that much harder to protect their turf,” he said."

The international brokerage said that the housing markets of Bengaluru and Chennai can still continue to grow, but Hyderabad is likely past its peak. Mumbai Metropolitan Region's (MMR) housing market is at a mid-cycle stage, while Pune has shown 'growth fatigue', according to the brokerage note cited by ET Now. Gurugram however faces an 'affordability challenge', it added. Speaking about the real estate stocks, Nuvama Institutional Equities said that they can remain range-bound if cyclicals continue to be out of favour. The domestic brokerage prefers Prestige Estates and Brigade Enterprises as its top picks in the sector. 'Sentiment around the real estate sector will remain cautious' According to the brokerage, sentiment around the real estate sector will remain cautious in near term amid challenges like weak volume growth on the back of a fall in affordability, lower hiring due to tariff-related concerns, and a slow recovery in economic growth, according to the brokerage note cited by Informist. ""We believe volatility shall continue and reckon stocks shall continue to remain range-bound with downside protected by falling mortgage rates while the upside is capped by valuation/volume growth concerns,"" the brokerage said. ""With price increases likely to moderate, investor-led demand may decline,"" it added. Nuvama's top real estate picks: Prestige Estates & Brigade Enterprises Nuvama maintains a 'Buy' rating for Prestige Estates and Brigade Enterprises.

Indian Hotels shares rise after report says Taj may exit New York's Pierre hotel in $2-bn deal,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/indian-hotels-shares-rise-after-report-says-taj-may-exit-new-york-s-pierre-hotel-in-2-bn-deal-13556404.html,"The shares of Indian Hotels Company (IHCL) gained 1 percent on September 18 amid reports saying that the Pierre Hotel in New York, which is managed by the Taj chain, may see a change in ownership. IHCL shares sharply rose 1 percent after trading in the red earlier during the day. Who are the prospective buyers? Prominent Saudi family, the Khashoggis, and the Dorchester Collection, a luxury hotel company owned by the sultanate of Brunei, have reached the final stages of discussions to purchase the iconic luxury hotel in New York for approximately $2 billion, New York Times reported citing sources. The Khashoggis will provide some of the funding, while Dorchester Collection will mostly manage the building after an extensive renovation, the report added. The iconic Pierre in New York was inaugurated in 1930, and was reintroduced in 2007 as the Taj flagship in the USA. The luxury hotel is located in the Central Park. According to the NYT report, billionaire and currently the US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick in 2023 pushed for the plan to hire his own real estate firm Newmark Group for advice on how to revamp the property which was seeing some damage over time. The board, as advised by Newmark, has now reached the final stages of talk to sell Piere for roughly $2 billion, the report added. 'Residents may be forced to move out' If the sale does take place, Pierre's permanent residents like former Disney chief Michael Eisner, fashion designer Tory Burch and Shari Redstone, who recently sold her company Paramount, may be forced to move out, the report added. Lutnick also has a penthouse in the Pierre. After months of discussions, Newmark concluded that Taj was not willing to invest more money to address the growing problems of the building, according to communications by The Times, cited by NYT. Moneycontrol couldn't independently verify the reports. The shares of IHCL have gained nearly 2 percent in the past five days, but have fallen around 10 percent in 2025 so far. The stock gained nearly 16 percent in the past one year. Also read: Our LIVE blog on stock market updates"

Cohance Life shares tumble 6% as 3.4 crore shares exchange hands via block deal,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/cohance-life-shares-tumble-6-as-3-4-crore-shares-exchange-hands-via-block-deal-13556246.html,"Shares of Cohance Lifesciences came under sharp pressure on September 18, tumbling 6 percent to Rs 909 apiece after a large block deal hit the exchanges. Around 3.39 crore shares, translating to 8.9 percent equity worth Rs 3,073 crore, changed hands in early trade. While the identity of sellers was not confirmed, reports on CNBC-TV18 suggested that Jusmiral Holdings was looking to offload up to 8.9 percent stake in the company. The reported deal is also accompanied by a 210-day lock-up on further share sales. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog Despite the knee-jerk reaction, global brokerage Jefferies has an optimistic view on Cohance and the broader Indian CRDMO (Contract Research, Development, and Manufacturing Organization) sector. The brokerage recently initiated coverage with a “Buy” rating and a price target of Rs 1,150, citing structural tailwinds. “India’s CRDMO industry is transitioning from being a traditional chemical manufacturer to becoming a strategic partner for global innovators. This shift, driven by enhanced capabilities, geographic diversification, and the China+1 strategy, could deliver a high-teen revenue CAGR over the next decade,” Jefferies said. In Q1FY26, Cohance reported an adjusted net profit of Rs 62.9 crore, down 24.8 percent year-on-year from Rs 83.5 crore in Q1FY25. Revenue from operations, however, rose 12.5 percent YoY to Rs 549.3 crore, supported by growth across segments. Material margin improved 20.1 percent YoY to Rs 401.2 crore, with margin percentage expanding to 73 percent from 68.4 percent, aided by a favourable business mix and contributions from recent acquisitions.

"Infosys, LTIMindtree, Wipro, other IT stocks rise up to 3% after 25 bps Fed rate cut",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/infosys-ltimindtree-wipro-other-it-stocks-rise-up-to-3-after-25-bps-fed-rate-cut-13556193.html,"The shares of Indian IT companies jumped on September 18 after the US Federal Reserve cut its interest rate for the first time since December 2024. The sharp rise in the share prices pushed the Nifty IT index higher to emerge as the top sectoral gainer on the market today. The Nifty IT index rose 1.5 percent in the morning to 37,006, extending gains for the third consecutive session. US Fed cuts rates by 25 bps: The US Federal Reserve on September 17 slashed its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 4-4.25 percent, in line with analyst expectations. Notably, this marked the first rate cut announced by the American central bank since Donald Trump began his second term as the President of the United States. More rate cuts on the way? Policymakers hinted at two more quarter-point cuts this year (50 bps in total), plus one cut in 2026 and another in 2027. One official projected a whopping 125 bps of easing by December. In its statement, the US Fed said ""recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity moderated in the first half of the year. Job gains have slowed, and the unemployment rate has edged up but remains low. Inflation has moved up and remains somewhat elevated."" It added that ""downside risks to employment have risen"", prompting the shift in policy. 'A risk management cut' During the press conference, US Fed Chair Jerome Powell called the quarter-point rate cut a ""risk management cut"", highlighting that the labour market has softened and ""the recent pace of job creation appears to be running below the breakeven rate needed to hold the unemployment rate constant."" He added, ""The labour market is softening and we don’t need it to soften anymore (and) don't want it to."" Why IT stocks surge after Fed's rate cut: A rate cut in the US is expected to increase the discretionary spending limit, which in turn benefits IT companies which derive a significant portion of their revenue from the North American market. LTIMindtree shares jumped nearly 3 percent to trade at Rs 5,573 apiece. Infosys, Wipro and Mphasis shares surged nearly 2 percent each. Persistent Systems, HCL Tech, Coforge and Tech Mahindra shares gained more than 1 percent each. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) shares were up nearly 1 percent. What analysts say? ""The FED continues to face a delicate balancing act following a 0.25% rate cut at its latest meeting in September. Whilst the rate cut was expected, it is of more note to listen to what Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in the Press Conference afterwards, where he mentioned that policy decisions remain challenging, and the committee members are still split on further rate cuts, with 10 out of 19 policy makers seeing two or more rate cuts this year,"" said Ross Maxwell, Global Strategy Lead at VT Markets. ""Financial markets are likely to welcome the rate cut in the near term, as lower borrowing costs ease pressure on households and businesses. Equity markets may see short-term support, though bond yields could remain volatile as investors weigh growth concerns against inflation risks,"" he added.

PM Modi turns 75: Sensex rallied up to 245% under his leadership; what lies ahead?,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sensex-rallied-up-to-245-under-pm-modi-s-leadership-what-lies-ahead-13554288.html,"Indian capital markets have seen strong surge since Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power in 2014. Indian benchmark index Sensex rose up to 60,000 points since then, which implies gains to the tune of nearly 245 percent. Analysts now expect the Indian stock markets to rally further, under PM Modi's leadership. Sensex jumped 245% in 10 years: Prime Minister Narendra Modi took charge on May 26, 2014. Sensex was trading at around 25,000-level then. The benchmark index then rallied more than 60,000 points (around 245 percent) in around 10 years to nearly touch the 86,000-mark in September 2024. The index has now seen some correction, closing at 82,694 on September 17. Several analysts who spoke to Moneycontrol suggest that Sensex can rally sharply to hit the key 1,00,000-mark by the end of PM Modi's third term in 2029. What led to the sharp gains? According to Khushi Mistry, Research Analyst at Bonanza, Sensex and Nifty's massive gains since May 2014 have been driven by reforms-led FDI inflows, robust consumption growth, a banking sector reset, accelerated digital adoption, and strong corporate earnings, alongside global liquidity and a stable policy framework under the Modi government. Sensex hitting 1 lakh by the end of PM Modi’s third term is possible if current earnings growth (14–16% CAGR), government reforms, and capex cycle sustain, she said, adding that risks include global volatility and oil prices. ""Bullish estimates expect Sensex could hit the mark before 2029 if reforms stay on track, but any major shocks could delay this milestone,"" the analyst said. 'Sensex at 1 lakh is a very achievable target' Shravan Shetty, Managing Director at Primus Partners, said hitting 1 lakh mark in the next three years is a very achievable target. “Historically, markets have grown at 12-15% and with markets at 82K, it should reach the target. We believe that the India story is still being played out, and with lower growth expected globally, especially the USA, we should see higher FII participation helping markets grow,"" he said. Santosh Meena, Head of Research at Swastika Investmart, believes it is quite possible for the Sensex to reach the 1,00,000 mark by the end of Prime Minister Modi’s third term, as it is only about 20 percent away from current levels. 'Valuations have become more reasonable now' ""After a year of flat returns, valuations have become more reasonable, creating a comfortable entry point. On the domestic front, growth-supportive factors remain strong, with recent income tax cuts, interest rate reductions, and GST rationalization acting as key catalysts that can drive the next leg of market expansion,"" he added. Morgan Stanley in August had said that it sees Sensex hitting the key 1 lakh mark by June next year in bull case, citing a final trade deal with the US, more capex announcements, acceleration in loans, uniform improvement in high frequency data and improving trade with China as the likely triggers. However, it had also suggested a bear case where Sensex could fall to 70,000 on the back of surging oil prices, slowing growth and more. 'Democratisation of India's capital markets under PM Modi's leadership' Extending wishes to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on his 75th birthday, NSE CEO Ashish Chauhan on September 17 noted how India's capital markets developed under PM Modi’s leadership over the years. ""Under his leadership, India has emerged as the world's fourth-largest economy and the fourth-largest capital market, with the equity market capitalisation of NSE-listed companies rising over 6 times-from about Rs 67 lakh crore in May 2014 to nearly Rs 460 lakh crore today,"" he said. Chauhan said the ""democratisation of capital markets"" reflects the rise of India's middle class, with nearly one in four households now investing in equities, which underscores the growing trust in India's economic future under PM Modi’s leadership.

Click to View More Outlook for September 18 Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets edged higher in a subdued session on Wednesday, reflecting a positive yet cautious undertone. After a firm start, the Nifty index traded in a narrow range throughout the day before settling at 25,330.25 level. Sectoral performance was mixed, with IT, banking, and auto emerging as the top gainers, while metals, FMCG, and pharma witnessed profit-taking. Meanwhile, the broader indices maintained their positive bias, with both midcap and small-cap indices closing in the green. Despite the range-bound move, underlying sentiment remains supported by optimism around policy reforms and robust domestic flows. However, persistent FII selling and caution ahead of the U.S. Fed policy outcome capped the momentum. On the index front, the Nifty is now inching towards the 25,500 mark, aided by renewed strength in banking and rotational buying across sectors. We recommend continuing with a “buy on dips” approach, with support placed around the 25,050–25,150 zone, while keeping position sizes moderate given the likelihood of higher volatility due to global events. Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities Today, the benchmark indices continued their positive momentum. The Nifty ended with a gain of 91 points, while the Sensex was up by 313 points. Among sectors, the PSU Bank Index outperformed, rallying over 2.60 percent, whereas consumer and selective Metal stocks registered intraday profit booking at higher levels. Technically, after a promising opening, the entire day witnessed range-bound activity. However, the short-term market outlook remains positive. We believe that 25,200/82500 and 25,150/82200 are key support zones for trend-following traders. As long as the market trades above these levels, the uptrend is likely to continue. On the higher side, the index could move up to 25,400-25,500/83000-83200. Conversely, below 25,150/82200, traders may consider exiting their long positions Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

This comes as analysts increasingly expect trade talks between India and US to resume, amid cooling tensions between the two countries. Gokaldas Exports shares surged nearly 7 percent to trade at nearly Rs 835 apiece. Welspun Living shares also rallied around 7 percent to trade at Rs 132.50 apiece. Pearl Global Industries and Arvind shares jumped around 4 percent each, while Indo Count Industries and K.P.R. Mill shares gained around 2 percent each. Raymond shares were up 1 percent. Cooling India-US trade tensions: Indo-US relations have seen some improvement in recent days with US President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreeing to resume trade talks. Brendan Lynch, a key US trade negotiator arrived in India yesterday to discuss 'trade issues' between Washington and New Delhi. Trump called Prime Minister Modi a ""dear friend"" and talked optimistically about the trade momentum. PM Modi, in turn, reaffirmed India and US as ""close friends and natural partners"" and expressed confidence that current trade talks would unlock significant potential for both nations. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said he had a ""wonderful call"" with PM Modi. ""I wished him a very Happy Birthday! He is doing a tremendous job. Narendra: Thank you for your support on ending the War between Russia and Ukraine! President DJT,"" he wrote. The Indian Prime Minister then thanked him for his birthday wishes. Easing trade tensions to boost export-oriented textile stocks: The cooling trade tensions between India and US provided much needed boost to the stock markets, as investors earlier remained worried over the impact of Trump's 50 percent tariff on India. All these developments reignited hopes for easing trade tensions between the two countries, which would likely benefit the export-oriented textile stocks. Motilal Oswal Financial Services said the markets are likely to be supported by encouraging developments in the ongoing US-India trade negotiations. ""A recent phone conversation between the US President and Indian Prime Minister on Modi’s birthday signals a willingness to ease tensions between the two major economies, further boosting investor sentiment,"" the domestic brokerage said.

SBI shares were trading at around Rs 857.40 apiece, extending gains for the third consecutive session. Yes Bank shares meanwhile were trading in the red with marginal losses at around Rs 20.94 apiece. About SMBC's deal to buy 20% stake in Yes Bank: Earlier in May this year, SMBC agreed to buy 20 percent stake in Yes Bank, marking one of the largest foreign investments in an Indian private bank. Following this deal, SMBC will emerge as the single-largest shareholder in Yes Bank. It was set to buy the largest chunk of over 13 percent stake from SBI (worth nearly Rs 8,889 crore), and the remaining (around 7 percent) from a group of Indian banks including Axis Bank, Bandhan Bank, Federal Bank, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, IDFC First Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank. These banks had originally invested in Yes Bank at around Rs 10 per share during its reconstruction phase in 2020. 'Largest cross-border investment in the Indian banking sector' ""The partial stake sale by SBI and other shareholder Banks in YBL to SMBC represents the largest cross-border investment in the Indian banking sector. The transaction has received the necessary regulatory and statutory approvals including from the Reserve Bank of India and the Competition Commission of India,"" SBI said in its press release. Following the divestment, SBI will continue to hold 10.8 percent stake in Yes Bank. Here's what SBI Chairman said on Yes Bank stake sale: ""Yes Bank restructuring plan by RBI in 2020 was an innovative, first of its kind public sector – private sector partnership that was fully supported and facilitated by Government of India. We are incredibly proud of the journey we have shared with Yes Bank in supporting their transformation since we came onboard as the major shareholder in 2020,"" said SBI Chairman Challa Sreenivasulu Setty. ""This is perhaps the best example of protecting the customer interests of a large bank by collaborative efforts of SBI and other banks under the guidance of Government of India and RBI. We are excited to welcome SMBC, a marquee financial institution, as a strategic partner through the largest cross-border transaction in India’s banking sector. Their global expertise will be a great complement to Yes Bank’s ongoing progress and future ambitions,"" he added.

Neutral NSDL; target of Rs 1200: Motilal Oswal,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/neutral-nsdl-target-of-rs-1200-motilal-oswal-13553372.html,"Motilal Oswal's research report on NSDL The opportunities for the entire Indian capital market ecosystem over the next decade, with a rising financialization trend but low penetration (demat penetration at 15% vs 60%+ in the US), continue to be immense (highlighted in our capital market thematic report). NSDL – the first depository of the country – is uniquely positioned to benefit from this trend, capturing both the breadth of new retail investors entering the system and the depth of rising custody value from institutional and corporate issuers. NSDL dominates in institutional, custodian, and large corporate accounts, resulting in revenue per active account at ~INR157 in FY25 — nearly 3x that of CDSL. The institutional skew offers more stable revenue pools linked to custody value rather than purely transaction volumes, underpinning resilience across market cycles. NSDL services the widest base of issuers in India, including ~70%+ of unlisted corporates mandated to dematerialize. This not only generates stable, recurring issuer charges but also creates a sticky moat, as issuers rarely migrate once demat systems are embedded. The potential growth for this is large, as the unlisted market in India continues to grow at a healthy pace. Outlook We expect a revenue/EBITDA/PAT CAGR of 5%/14%/15% over FY25-28. Given the duopoly nature of the industry and NSDL’s superior pricing power, depositories deserve premium valuations. However, we believe the stock is fairly valued, and all the positives are priced in at current levels. Hence, we initiate coverage on NSDL with a Neutral rating and a one-year TP of INR1,200 (premised on ~45x FY28E P/E).

"Defence shares extend rally to fourth day: GRSE, Cochin Shipyard, BEL rise up to 7%; here's why",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/defence-shares-extend-rally-to-fourth-day-grse-cochin-shipyard-bel-rise-up-to-7-here-s-why-13552972.html,"Defence shares extended their rally for the fourth straight session on Wednesday, with Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers (GRSE), Cochin Shipyard and Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL) among the major gainers. The Nifty India Defence index rose 2 percent in Wednesday’s trade, with all 18 constituents in positive territory. The index has gained 7.3 percent over the last four sessions. The sharp rally is witnessed on the back of strong investor interest and high trading volumes, following the Defence Ministry’s approval of the new Defence Procurement Manual (DPM) 2025. The revised framework aims to expedite revenue procurement for the armed forces, encourage domestic industry participation and align processes with modern warfare requirements, reported CNBC-TV18. According to the ministry, the manual is designed to ""streamline, simplify, enable and rationalise"" the procurement process, while officials said it would help maintain operational readiness through faster decision-making and timely resource availability. In Wednesday’s trade, shares of GRSE led the rally, rising 7.5 percent to touch an intraday high of Rs 2,624 on the NSE. The stock rebounded after two sessions of decline. A total of 2.7 lakh shares changed hands, generating a turnover of Rs 69.13 crore. The company’s market capitalisation stood at Rs 29,119.12 crore. On the NSE, volumes crossed 30.5 lakh shares by 11:30 am. Cochin Shipyard shares gained 2.5 percent to Rs 1,866 apiece on the NSE, while BEL advanced 2.16 percent to Rs 411.45 around 11:30 am.

"IT stocks gain for 2nd day on hopes of Fed rate cut: Persistent Systems, LTIM, others rise up to 2%",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/it-stocks-gain-for-2nd-day-on-hopes-of-fed-rate-cut-persistent-systems-ltim-others-rise-up-to-2-13553259.html,"The shares of Indian IT companies gained on September 17, as investors eagerly awaited a possible rate cut announcement by US Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell following the FOMC meeting later today. The Nifty IT index rose more than 0.8 percent in the morning, extending gains for the second consecutive session and emerging as one of the top sectoral gainers on the market today. Fed rate cut on the way? US Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell is set to announce the outcome of FOMC meeting which is being held from September 16 to September 17. Analysts estimate that the American central bank will cut rates this time — especially amid weak jobs data and rising pressure from President Donald Trump’s administration. Experts who spoke to Moneycontrol held different opinions regarding the quantum of rate cut that Fed chief Jerome Powell may announce today. Some opine that a 25 bps rate cut should be expected, while others hint at a bumper 50 bps cut. Very few, however, hold the view that the American central bank may keep the rates unchanged. A rate cut in the US is expected to increase the discretionary spending limit, which in turn benefits IT companies which derive a significant portion of their revenue from the North American market. Top IT gainers today: Persistent Systems shares were the top gainer on the index, rising more than 2 percent to trade at Rs 5,605 apiece. Mphasis and LTI Mindtree shares gained more than 1 percent each. Coforge, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Infosys shares rose around 0.8 percent each, while Tech Mahindra, HCL Tech and Wipro shares were up around 0.4 percent each. Notably, Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) has increased its stake in Tech Mahindra by a little over 2 percent, raising its holding from 8.836 percent to 10.84 percent, according to reports.

MCX shares rally 5 percent as Sebi chair Tuhin Kanta talks of steps to revive commodity derivatives,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/commodities/mcx-shares-rally-5-percent-as-sebi-chair-tuhin-kanta-talks-of-steps-to-revive-commodity-derivatives-13553252.html,"Shares of leading commodity derivatives exchange MCX are sharply higher by 5 percent tracking comments by market regulator Sebi's chairman Tuhin Kanta Pandey, who during the MCX Metals Summit 2025 said there are plans to set up a working group on agri and non-agri commodities to address the bottlenecks for the segment's volume growth. Sebi is of the view that enhanced institutional participation into the commodities market can bring in liquidity and make it more attractive as a tool for hedging, and regulations will be developed to ensure 'prudent institutional access', said the chairman. A proposal to allow FPIs to trade in non-cash, non-agricultural commodity derivative segment is also under examination. The chairman said the regulator will engage with the government to consider banks, insurers and pension funds to trade in these markets. This is in line with Sebi's plans to revive derivatives trading in agri-commodities, and the development was previously reported by Moneycontrol in July 2025. ""Strengthening India's commodity market is high on Sebi's regulatory and development agenda. We have already constituted a committee to recommend measures for deepening the agri-commodities segment. We will also constitute a working group for developing the non-agri commodities segment, including metals,"" said Tuhin Kanta Pandey. Citing ongoing supply chain disruption and tariff wars, Sebi chairman said a robust derivatives market provides a ""powerful shield allowing Indian producers and consumers to hedge against global price shocks."" This need is even more pronounced in the context of critical minerals, he added. ""Our approach will be multi-pronged. First, we will continue to strengthen the integrity and safety of the market. Measures like real-time margin collection and continued monitoring are non-negotiable. Second, we will foster market development and innovation. This means encouraging our exchanges to constantly evolve. Third, we aim to deepen and widen participation. Our markets are for large corporations, traders, importers and SMEs. They are also available for institutional investors such as mutual funds and AIFs who are increasingly recognising metals as an asset class that improves risk-adjusted returns for investors,"" Sebi chairman said."

"Tata Consumer targets premiumization of tea portfolio to take on HUL, shares higher by 3 percent",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/tata-consumer-targets-premiumization-of-tea-portfolio-to-take-on-hul-shares-higher-by-3-percent-13552895.html,"FMCG major Tata Consumer Products (TCPL) has plans to pursue premiumization of its tea portfolio to drive growth and unlock value for shareholders, spurring the shares higher by nearly 3 percent in early trade on September 17, with volumes higher than the one-month average of 10 lakh shares. The President of packaged beverages business for India and South Asia, Puneet Das confirmed the plans to seek premiumization of its portfolio to drive growth. TCPL offers packaged beverage products, including tea under different premium and economy brands, in both general trade and e-commerce routes with the offline mode contributing to 80 percent of sales. In the e-commerce channel, Tata Tea has sustained market leadership for three years, outpacing competitors, the company has said. A news report by Informist Media quoted Puneet Das telling reporters in Kolkata that the company will aim to reclaim volume leadership in the segment, which was ceded to Hindustan Unilever in 2017-18. Das added that the difference between TCPL and HUL's sales is less than a percent in terms of volume, and around 4-5 percent in value terms. Tatas are targetting a 6-8 percent total value growth in the tea segment for the fiscal, according to the June quarter earnings call. TCPL recently launched premium offerings in the tea category, including a green tea with L-Carnitine, an amino acid that helps burn fat, as well as brought in Sachin Tendulkar to endorse Organic India, a brand that the Tatas acquired in 2024. Aside of new launches and deeper distribution network, Tata Global said it aims to expand into towns with populations between 50,000 and 100,000 to increase market reach. Going forward, the management believes if the tea prices fall it may result in lower cost for consumers, but TCPL said it is confident of holding on to profit margins of 30 percent range by Q3FY26. ""If the tea prices come off rapidly, the locals will have access to lower tea prices. And therefore, as we see market prices moving, we will -- like I said, 34% to 36%, 37%, is a margin which we are comfortable with. I don't think this category, you can go beyond this and therefore, as -- if prices come down more dramatically, we will have to give up something in terms of consumer price as well. But overall, I would say, by Q3, you should see margins operating in this range. On a YTD basis, Tata Consumer shares are higher by 22 percent, and down 8 percent over last one year."
"Sensex up 313 pts, Nifty above 25,330: Optimism over US trade talks among key factors behind market rise",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sensex-up-300-pts-nifty-above-25-300-optimism-over-us-trade-talks-among-key-factors-behind-market-rise-13552775.html,"Indian benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty extended gains on September 17 on the back of multiple positive factors. Sensex gained around 313 points (nearly 0.4 percent) to close at 82,693.71. Nifty 50, meanwhile, rose 91 points (0.36 percent) to end the session at 25,330.25. PSU Bank stocks led gains, with IT, realty, auto and media stocks were also among the top gainers. FMCG, metal and pharma stocks, however, were trading in the red. Here are the possible key factors pushing the markets into the green: Cooling India-US trade tensions: Indo-US relations have seen some improvement in recent days with US President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreeing to resume trade talks. Brendan Lynch, a key US trade negotiator arrived in India yesterday to discuss 'trade issues' between Washington and New Delhi. Trump called Prime Minister Modi a ""dear friend"" and talked optimistically about the trade momentum. PM Modi, in turn, reaffirmed India and US as ""close friends and natural partners"" and expressed confidence that current trade talks would unlock significant potential for both nations. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said he had a ""wonderful call"" with PM Modi. ""I wished him a very Happy Birthday! He is doing a tremendous job. Narendra: Thank you for your support on ending the War between Russia and Ukraine! President DJT,"" he wrote. The Indian Prime Minister then thanked him for his birthday wishes. The cooling trade tensions between India and US provided much needed boost to the stock markets, as investors earlier remained worried over the impact of Trump's 50 percent tariff on India. Motilal Oswal Financial Services said the markets are likely to be supported by encouraging developments in the ongoing US-India trade negotiations. ""A recent phone conversation between the US President and Indian Prime Minister on Modi’s birthday signals a willingness to ease tensions between the two major economies, further boosting investor sentiment,"" the domestic brokerage said. Likelihood of Fed rate cut: The US Federal Reserve is holding its FOMC meeting from September 16 to September 17. The American central bank's chief Jerome Powell is set to announce the outcome of the meet later today. Analysts estimate that the Fed will cut rates this time — especially amid weak jobs data and rising pressure from President Donald Trump's administration. Rate cut decision by the US Federal Reserve impact the Indian stock market, as it weighs or boosts several rate sensitive stocks. For example, a rate cut in the US is expected to increase the discretionary spending limit, which in turn benefits IT companies which derive a significant portion of their revenue from the North American market. Also, investors expect a rate cut in the US to pave the way for a rate cut in India. The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is set to meet between September 29 and October 1. Any rate cut announcement by the RBI directly impacts the market. Weak US dollar: Rupee recorded its best start in three weeks, opening below the 88-mark on September 17. The currency opened at 87.82 against the dollar after closing the previous session at 88.05. This comes as dollar index remained week as investors awaited Fed’s FOMC meet outcome. ""Expectations of a 25 basis point rate cut by the US Federal Reserve in today's FOMC meeting, coupled with the US Dollar Index dropping to a 3.5-year low below the 96 mark, are likely to support market optimism,"" said Motilal Oswal Financial Services. ""The ongoing rally in the market is being driven by a combination of positive sentiments and fundamentals. The market expects the renewed India-U S trade talks to result in an agreement, culminating in the withdrawal of the 25% penal tariffs imposed on India. If expectations translate into reality, that would be a huge sentiment positive,"" said VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments. ""Fundamentally, the GST reform is expected to trigger an impressive demand spurt led by automobiles. Auto stocks have already rallied, discounting the expectations. White goods, particularly air conditioners, can be beneficiaries. NBFCs financing the purchase of white goods, too, have rallied. Some leading private sector banks like HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank are yet to participate in the rally. These stocks are fairly valued. The Fed is expected to cut rates by 25 bps tonight. More than the rate action the Fed commentary on the evolving economic outlook and the trajectory of future rate action will be closely watched by the market,"" he added.
