Buy Eternal; target of Rs 315: ICICI Securities,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-eternal-target-of-rs-315-icici-securities-13307393.html,"ICICI Securities research report on Eternal Blinkit’s adj. EBITDA margin (% of NOV) improved ~60bps QoQ in Q1FY26 despite adding 243 stores (ISec est.: 220) with steady take rate and contribution margin. We believe this is due to rationalisation of marketing spends as competitive intensity cooled off, something we had highlighted earlier from our channel checks. Management reiterated 2,000 stores target by Q3 and guided for 100bps adj. EBITDA margin expansion from pivoting to an inventory-led model. 70% YoY NOV expansion in Delhi, called out in the shareholder letter, is a key positive which explains Blinkit’s aspirations to reach 3,000 stores in medium term. 13% NOV growth in food delivery, though lower than estimated, can be understood given the management transition. Improving demand outlook in FD is another key positive. Maintain BUY. Outlook We maintain BUY on Eternal with a three-stage DCF-based target price of INR 315. (earlier INR 310). Risks: Slowdown in discretionary spending and negative externalities disrupting business operations.

We believe (1) Havells is likely to benefit via market share gains as smaller/ unorganised players are likely to be more impacted. (2) The company has invested in solar products and it considers solar as one of the major growth drivers in medium-long term. (3) The company has initiated various cost saving initiatives and it augurs well for long term. (4) We note other segments such as stabilizers and cables and wires continue to generate healthy demand. With real estate cycle progressing well, there is potentially strong demand for finishing products such as wires, lighting, switches in H2FY26 and FY27. (5) Havells has materially increased its investments in cables and wires which is also expected to emerge as one of major value drivers. Outlook We cut FY26-27E PAT by 7.3%-9.1% to factor in weak Q1FY26 and impact of high inventory at company and channel levels.

Eternal, which owns the Zomato and Blinkit brands, reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 25 crore for the quarter ended June, aided by strong growth in its quick commerce arm. The stock hit a record high of Rs 311.25 on July 22, rallying nearly 15 percent on the day and emerging as the top gainer on the Nifty 50 index. The sharp uptick in share price lifted the company’s market capitalisation to Rs 3 lakh crore, marking a surge of about Rs 40,000 crore in under two sessions. Brokerages responded positively to the earnings, with at least ten firms raising their price targets and four upgrading their ratings, according to LSEG data. The median 12-month target price rose to Rs 311 from Rs 287.5 a month earlier, reported Reuters. Blinkit, Eternal’s quick-commerce platform, reported a 127 percent year-on-year rise in net order value to Rs 9,203 crore, overtaking the growth of the company’s traditional food delivery business for the first time. Analysts at Nuvama said Blinkit “outshines on growth”, while Jefferies noted improved margins and scaled-back concerns on competitive pressures. Jefferies said it had “overestimated the competitive threat” to Blinkit from other players, including BigBasket, Flipkart, Swiggy and Amazon. Swiggy’s shares rose 5.3 percent, driven by positive sentiment following Blinkit's performance, which signals broader investor confidence in the quick-commerce segment. Shares of Info Edge gained up to 5 percent during the session. The company holds over 13 percent stake in Eternal.

The sharp rise in the share prices pushed the Nifty Capital Markets index up over half a percent to hover around 4,701 in early trade, extending gains for a second consecutive session. In a statement issued on July 21, Sebi said that Jane Street entities have been directed to cease and desist from directly or indirectly engaging in any fraudulent, manipulative or unfair trade practices or undertaking any activity that may be in breach of regulatory norm. Stock Exchanges have been directed to closely monitor any future dealings and positions of Jane Street Group, until Sebi completes its investigation. The market regulator said the exchanges have confirmed compliance with these rules. Angel One and Nuvama Wealth Management shares gained nearly 3 percent each to trade at Rs 2,782 apiece and Rs 7,824 apiece respectively. Notably, Nuvama is Jane Street’s domestic trading partner in India. The shares of Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) gained nearly 2 percent to trade at Rs 2,563 apiece. The shares of the stock exchange tumbled nearly 8 percent in the past one month, after Sebi restrained Jane Street from participating in the Indian stock market. This came after a 33 percent surge in the past six months. UTI AMC and Indian Energy Exchange (IEX) shares gained over 1 percent each, while CDSL, Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) and Motilal Oswal Financial Services rose nearly 1 percent. Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC, Kfin Technologies and other capital market stocks were trading in the green with marginal gains. Also read: Our LIVE on stock market updates Sebi had taken strict actions against Jane Street during the previous month, amid allegations that the firm manipulated Bank Nifty and Nifty, by exploiting specific trading patterns. SEBI conducted an investigation into trades between January 2023 and May 2025. The watchdog alleged that, on some occasions, the Jane Street entities bought heavily in cash and futures in the morning and heavily sold options in the afternoon, thereby creating deception for common traders. Based on the initial investigation, Sebi suspects that the Jane Street entities made an illegal gain of Rs 4,843.5 crore, and subsequently the regulator directed Jane Street entities to deposit the amount in an escrow account, which Jane Street has complied with."
Titan shares gain as firm announces acquisition of majority 67% stake in UAE-based Damas Jewellery,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/titan-shares-gain-as-firm-announces-acquisition-of-a-majority-67pc-stake-in-uae-based-damas-jewellery-13306755.html,"Titan shares gained in July 22 trading session as the country's leading branded jewellery maker company announced to acquire a majority 67 percent stake in UAE-based Damas Jewellery in an all-cash deal. The move will help the Tata group-managed firm to expand business in GCC countries. Shares of Titan Company Ltd. surged nearly 1 percent higher at Rs 3,454.4 per share on the NSE, up 0.62 percent. Titan's wholly-owned subsidiary Titan Holdings International FZCO on Monday signed a definitive agreement with Mannai Corporation for the purchase of its 67 percent shareholding in Damas LLC (UAE), the current holding company for Damas jewellery business in GCC countries. ""The consideration for the proposed transaction is arrived on the basis of the enterprise value of AED 1,038 million (nearly Rs 2,438.56 crore),"" said a joint statement. Damas jewellery's rich brand legacy and strong presence in the GCC region align perfectly with Titan's vision. Damas, headquartered in Dubai, became a subsidiary of Mannai in 2012, and the time has come for investment in the next phase of its expansion in the region, said Grewal. Titan Company is a joint venture between the Tata Group and the Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation (TIDCO). It had commenced its operations in 1987 under the name Titan Watches and later in 1994, Titan diversified into Jewellery (Tanishq) and subsequently into EyeCare. In FY'25, Titan's revenue from operations was at Rs 57,339 crore, in which its jewellery division contributed Rs 46,571 crore, which is over 81 percent.

"Eternal shares hit record high as Blinkit growth outpaces Zomato; should you buy, sell, or hold?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/eternal-shares-eyed-as-blinkit-outpaces-zomato-but-profit-slumps-should-you-buy-sell-or-hold-13306347.html,"Shares of food delivery and quick commerce major Eternal Ltd, formerly known as Zomato, hit a fresh record high in the early session on Tuesday, July 22, after its seven percent jump in the previous session following its earnings report for the April-June period. Eternal posted a steep 90 percent year-on-year decline in net profit for the first quarter of FY26, with earnings falling to Rs 25 crore from Rs 253 crore a year earlier. Despite the profit slump, revenue rose 70 percent year-on-year to Rs 7,167 crore during the same period. At 9.40 a.m., shares of the firm were quoting Rs 311.25, higher by 11 percent on the NSE. Blinkit generated Rs 2,400 crore in revenue in Q1, outpacing Zomato's food delivery revenue, which stood at Rs 2,261 crore. The firm's consolidated EBITDA for the quarter came in at Rs 115 crore, down 35 percent compared to the same period last year. In the previous session, positive commentary from the management lifted Eternal's stock to five-month highs. The firm said that Blinkit's net order value (NOV) overtook that of Zomato for the first time. “Our B2C operations have now reached nearly $10 billion in annualised NOV, with quick commerce accounting for nearly half of it,” said CFO Akshant Goyal. Should you buy, sell, or hold shares of Eternal? Despite the company's net profit cracking 90 percent in trade, a large number of brokerages remained bullish on Eternal's shares. International broking house Jefferies upgraded its outlook on the firm to 'buy', with an increased price target of Rs 400 per share. The brokerage said that while Q1 performance was mixed, the management commentary was notably positive. Growth continues to be strong, and the margin outlook has improved as competitive pressures ease. Although food delivery growth moderated, the management expects a pick-up with short-term margins remaining rangebound. CLSA reiterated its 'high-conviction outperform' tag on Eternal, maintaining its price target of Rs 385 per share, as Blinkit's performance exceeded estimates in terms of GOV and contribution. Bernstein, too, reaffirmed its 'outperform' rating, hiking its target price to Rs 320 per share on the strong beat in the quick-commerce segment. On the flip side, Macquarie was an outlier with an 'underperform' rating and a price target of Rs 150 per share. The brokerage said that food delivery growth lagged, even as quick commerce posted explosive growth. The moderation in quick commerce losses is viewed as a positive. However, competitive intensity is expected to stay high, leading to a prolonged period of losses.

"Three key risks for Indian equities but rest of 2025 likely to be better, says StanC's top investment official",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/three-key-risks-for-indian-equities-but-rest-of-2025-likely-to-be-better-says-stanc-s-top-investment-official-13305781.html,"Global policy uncertainties along with slowing global growth concerns and escalating geopolitical tensions are the key risks for equities in India in the second half of 2025, says Manpreet Gill, Chief Investment Officer - Africa, Middle East & Europe (AMEE), Standard Chartered. He, however, adds that earnings and economic growth in India are expected to revive in the second half with the worst behind us and domestic focused sectors are likely to do well. “I would rank policy uncertainty as the highest risk because that goes with the heart of US trade policy and where do we end up... I would say growth downturn perhaps would come a close second with geopolitical concerns as well,” said Gill in an interaction with Moneycontrol. “A lot of the risks globally and for India ultimately stem from the risk to US inflation. We talk about tariffs, we talk about oil prices, geopolitics, but a channel to financial markets, and how they become a risk for markets is actually because of their impact on inflation,” added Gill. In an India Market Outlook report released earlier this month, Standard Chartered stated that it stays “overweight equities” as “easing financial conditions, improving macro fundamentals and revival in corporate earnings amid a weak USD (US dollar) outlook are supportive of risk assets outperformance”. “We believe both, economic and earnings growth is likely to revive in H2 2025. Easing financial conditions and the fiscal boost via income tax cuts is likely to lift consumption supporting domestic demand and corporate earnings performance. In our view, though the worst for Indian assets maybe behind us, investors need to be selective in risk taking,” added the report. According to the global foreign bank, the first half of 2025 was a textbook lesson in investing through volatility and overall, asset class performance suggests a favourable risk environment with Indian equities, bonds and gold delivering 9%, 5% and 26% returns (local currency) respectively. “We are not expecting to return to the heady days of 25% annualised returns on Nifty but we still think that it is the best place to be in terms of delivering the best returns and we don't think it needs much beyond stabilisation of growth to actually get to that point,” said Gill. The global investment expert is bullish on domestic focussed sectors like financials, healthcare and consumer discretionary while advising investors to be cautious on IT. Meanwhile, the three key lessons for investors, according to Standard Chartered are that market timing is difficult and costly, diversified allocation can help tide through volatility, and geopolitical conflicts tend to have a short-term impact. The foreign bank also expects bond yields to decline modestly over a 12-month horizon. “Frontloaded policy easing and improving banking system liquidity are offset by unattractive yield premiums. We see steepening of domestic bond yield curve and are OW medium-maturity bonds and high-quality (AAA) corporate bonds,’ stated the report. Interestingly, according to Gill, the worst is behind us and investors should stay invested in equities even as there was heightened volatility witnessed in the first half of 2025. “We believe that with Indian equities as well as with global equities, one should expect volatility, but we still think is better off to stay invested,” said Gill.

Zomato-parent Eternal's shares rally over 7% despite 90% plunge in Q1 net profit: Here's why,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/zomato-parent-eternal-s-shares-rally-over-7-despite-90-plunge-in-net-profit-here-s-why-13304098.html,"Online delivery firm Eternal's shares sharply rallied 7.5 percent to close at Rs 276.50 apiece on NSE. This happened after the company released its results for the first quarter of the financial year 2026. Zomato's parent company reported a 90 percent on-year drop in net profit to Rs 25 crore in Q1 FY26. Its revenue from operations however rose 70 percent on-year to Rs 7,167 crore during the quarter under review. However, positive management commentary led to Eternal's shares hit five-month high on July 21. Blinkit beats Zomato in NOV: Eternal said that Q1 marked the first quarter where Blinkit's net order value (NOV) surpassed that of Zomato. ""On an annualized basis, we are now at almost $10 billion of annual NOV across our B2C businesses and quick commerce is now our largest B2C business contributing to almost half of this annualized NOV,"" said Eternal CFO Akshant Goyal. Blinkit added 243 stores during the quarter under review, taking its store count to 1,544 stores by the end of the quarter. ""We are on track to get to 2,000 stores by Dec 2025. We also added 0.4 million sq ft of warehousing space and now operate over 5.6 million sq ft of warehousing space across the country,"" said Blinkit CEO Albinder Dhindsa. Blinkit's revenue surges 154%: The firm reported quick commerce revenue at Rs 2,400 crore for Q1 FY26, marking a surge of nearly 154 percent YoY from Rs 942 crore in Q1 FY25. Revenue generated from food delivery segment rose over 16 percent on-year to Rs 2,261 crore. Zomato's adjusted EBITDA margin rises on-year: Eternal said that its adjusted EBITDA margin for Zomato stood at 5 percent in Q1 FY26, higher than the 3.9 percent reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year. Eternal noted that its food delivery margins have declined sequentially. ""I think the YoY growth is likely to bottom out now as we recover from the demand slowdown we started seeing in late 2024. For FY26, it looks unlikely that the business will deliver a 20%+ NOV growth but we should be north of 15% and hopefully trending towards 20% YoY growth in FY27,"" said Deepinder Goyal. Management on new entrants in food delivery segment: When asked about the possible disruption from the entry of new players in the food delivery segments, Goyal said that it is inevitable. ""New ideas, new entrants and disruption are all inevitable. I think it also makes our business stronger as long as we are able to learn, adapt and out-innovate potential competition. At this point, we do not see any innovation in the space which makes us believe that this business is under any obvious threat,"" he said. This comes amid buzz over cab-hailing platform Rapido's potential entry into the food delivery segment. Eternal announces incorporation of Blinkit Foods: Eternal's board has approved the incorporation of its wholly-owned subsidiary Blinkit Foods with a proposed share capital of Rs 10 lakh. ""Blinkit Foods is proposed to be incorporated as a wholly owned subsidiary and would inter-alia engage in the business of providing food services (including innovation, preparation, sourcing, sale and delivery of food to customers),"" the company said. District generating higher average revenue per order than Zomato, Blinkit: Zomato CFO Akshant Goyal said that the average revenue per order generated by its going out business (District) is more than Rs 160, which is meaningfully higher than our food delivery (Zomato) and quick commerce (Blinkit) businesses. ""If we execute well, this business has the potential to scale to $3 billion in annual topline (NOV) with $150m of Adjusted EBITDA sometime over the next five years,"" he added. Deepinder Goyal meanwhile said that the firm's 'Going-out' segment is now a Rs 8,000-crore annualized NOV business. This already represents nearly 20 percent of the size of Zomato and Blinkit. ""In Q1FY26, we had about 2 million average monthly transacting customers transacting ~2 times a month on an average with a net AOV (NAOV) of INR 1,700+,"" he said.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade ICICI Bank, Varun Beverages, Sonata Software, Bajaj Auto, M&M, UPL, L&T Finance, KEI Industries and others on July 22?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-icici-bank-varun-beverages-sonata-software-bajaj-auto-m-m-upl-l-t-finance-kei-industries-and-others-on-july-22-13305295.html,"Equity benchmark indices gained 0.5 percent on July 21 following a couple of days of correction, but the market breadth was slightly in favour of bears. A total of 1,392 shares declined compared to 1,295 advancing shares on the NSE. The continuation of the northward journey is possible only if the market posts a strong close above the 20-day EMA. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi Hero MotoCorp | CMP: Rs 4,408.2 Hero MotoCorp recently consolidated within a tight range of Rs 4,150–4,375, forming a classic triangle pattern on the charts. On July 15, the stock broke out decisively from this formation, accompanied by a significant rise in volume, confirming the validity of the breakout. This technical strength is further supported by the Camarilla monthly pivot structure, which displayed an inside value relationship — a setup that often precedes sharp directional moves. The confluence of these factors suggests strong bullish potential in the near term. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 4,420–4,380 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 4,800 Stop-Loss: Rs 4,200 Varun Beverages | CMP: Rs 489.3 After undergoing a sharp correction of nearly 22% from its recent high of Rs 570, Varun Beverages has shown signs of a potential reversal. The stock has successfully breached a falling trendline on the daily chart, supported by a noticeable increase in volume — a key indicator of renewed buying interest. Adding to the bullish case, a positive RSI divergence is visible, reinforcing the likelihood of an upward move. Despite a 7% gain in the past week, the technical setup remains favourable, and a fresh long entry is still justified. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 490–485 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 530 Stop-Loss: Rs 465 Sonata Software | CMP: Rs 438 Sonata Software formed back-to-back inside value relationships on monthly Camarilla pivots, signaling consolidation and strong buildup. A breakout on July 8 confirmed the end of this phase. Since then, the stock has entered a healthy pullback, finding strong support above Rs 420 — a key technical level. Holding above this mark suggests buyer strength, and if sustained, Sonata Software may resume its upward trajectory in the coming sessions, with potential for further gains. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 440–430 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 500 Stop-Loss: Rs 405 Jay Thakkar, Vice President & Head of Derivatives and Quant Research at ICICI Securities Bajaj Auto | CMP: Rs 8,438.5 Bajaj Auto has provided a breakout from the falling trendline, and there has been short covering in the stock, which is likely to extend post this breakout. Significant Call unwinding has been observed from the Rs 8,100 to Rs 8,400 strikes, coupled with Put additions at the Rs 8,100 and Rs 8,200 strikes, which is positive in the near term. Therefore, in this series, further short covering is expected, which could help the stock bounce back to the Rs 8,600 to Rs 8,800 levels. Traders may consider buying Bajaj Auto Futures in the range of Rs 8,460 to Rs 8,430. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 8,670, Rs 8,800 Stop-Loss: Rs 8,290 State Bank of India | CMP: Rs 824.2 SBI has provided a breakout from the sideways consolidation and has retested the breakout level. It has been observed that the stock witnessed short additions during the previous fall, but since then, it has bounced back from its March lows due to short covering. Recent data now indicates long additions as well. The Options data shows that the Rs 820 and Rs 830 strikes have the highest Call base, but since the stock is trading well above its maximum pain level, the probability of these resistance levels being overcome is quite high. Traders may consider buying SBI Futures in the range of Rs 825 to Rs 820. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 850, Rs 870 Stop-Loss: Rs 814 Mahindra and Mahindra | CMP: Rs 3,246.7 M&M has been forming a higher base with increasing long buildup, and it has more room for long additions as the price nears lifetime highs. However, the overall long positions are still away from their highs, indicating that the stock is not overbought. Once the lifetime highs are surpassed, it can witness further upward momentum. The stock has witnessed significant Put additions at the Rs 3,100 and Rs 3,200 strikes, as well as Call unwinding at the Rs 3,200 strike, which is a positive sign. Although there is still significant Call writing beyond the Rs 3,200 level, the probability of upward momentum remains high as the futures data indicates that bulls have the upper hand. Hence, a meaningful close above Rs 3,300 will likely lead to further short covering in the Calls. Traders may consider buying M&M Futures in the range of Rs 3,370 to Rs 3,240. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,500, Rs 3,600 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,140 Vidnyan S Sawant, Head of Research at GEPL Capital UPL | CMP: Rs 713.75 UPL has witnessed a breakout on the monthly chart, moving above both its recent consolidation range and a downward-sloping trendline. The breakout, marked by a strong bullish candlestick, indicates positive price development on the higher timeframes. On the weekly chart, the stock continues to form a structure of higher highs and higher lows, while sustaining well above its 12, 26, and 50-week EMAs, highlighting strength in the ongoing trend. On the daily chart, UPL exhibits high relative strength despite broader market weakness, supported by a noticeable volume surge exceeding its 20-day EMA average volume. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 820 Stop-Loss: Rs 675 L&T Finance | CMP: Rs 210.58 L&T Finance recently broke out of a large cup-and-handle pattern on the monthly chart, with the current month showing follow-through positive momentum — reinforcing the bullish setup. On the weekly scale, the stock is well sustained above its key 5, 12, 26, and 50-week EMAs, reflecting strong trend alignment. The MACD indicator is trending higher, indicating accelerating momentum. On the daily chart, LTF has shown a bullish mean reversion from its 26-day EMA, accompanied by a volume surge above its 20-day average, further supporting the positive price action. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 240 Stop-Loss: Rs 200 ICICI Bank | CMP: Rs 1,465.8 ICICI Bank has been forming a consistent pattern of higher tops and higher bottoms across timeframes, highlighting a sustained long-term uptrend. On the weekly chart, the stock is consolidating near its 12-week EMA, indicating healthy digestion of prior gains. On the daily scale, it has formed a double bottom around the 50-day EMA, signaling a bullish price structure. The weekly RSI holding above 60 reflects sustained positive momentum and underlying strength. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,627 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,390 KEI Industries | CMP: Rs 3,972.4 KEI Industries has been in a strong long-term uptrend, consistently forming higher tops and higher bottoms. In April 2025, the stock witnessed a bullish mean reversion from its 50-month EMA, reigniting upward momentum. On the daily chart, a positive hidden divergence signaled renewed strength, with the stock maintaining high relative performance despite broader market volatility. It continues to trade above key moving averages — 12, 26, and 50-week EMAs — highlighting strong trend alignment and resilience.

Sebi announces common compliance reporting mechanism for brokers from August 1,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sebi-announces-common-compliance-reporting-mechanism-for-brokers-from-august-1-13304716.html,"Market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) and exchanges have introduced a common reporting mechanism for stock brokers. Brokers will be able to submit compliance reports to Samuhik Prativedan Manch, or the common reporting portal, at one exchange instead of multiple exchanges. As claimed by Sebi, close to a thousand stock brokers who have multiple memberships with NSE and other stock exchanges would benefit from this initiative. The Samuhik Prativedan Manch will eliminate the requirement to submit compliance reports to multiple exchanges where a stock broker is registered. This is expected to reduce brokers' compliance costs. As per Sebi, the new mechanism will be implemented in a phased manner, with the submission of 40 compliance reports in the first phase being implemented under Samuhik Prativedan Manch from August 1, 2025. As per Sebi, the Samuhik Prativedan Manch for brokers encourages a regulatory framework that is simple, transparent, and cost-effective, resulting in ease of doing business for the intermediaries and, in turn, ease of doing investments for investors. Streamlining and rationalising compliance reporting is a key measure for achieving ease of doing business. Stock brokers who are registered with multiple stock exchanges are currently required to submit compliance reports to all the exchanges with which they are registered. Sebi said that after the first phase from August 1, the later phases will standardise the rest of the document submissions and encompass them in the centralised reporting platform, across the remainder of the brokers, including commodity brokers.

Apollo Hospitals’ spin-off of digital-retail arm to unlock shareholder value; ‘mid-teen’ revenue growth expected from FY27: MD Suneeta Reddy,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/apollo-hospitals-spin-off-of-digital-retail-arm-to-unlock-shareholder-value-mid-teen-revenue-growth-expected-from-fy27-md-suneeta-reddy-13304116.html,"Suneeta Reddy, Managing Director of Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Ltd, said that the primary goal of the proposed spin-off and listing of its pharmacy and digital health businesses into a new entity, Apollo Health Technologies, is to unlock value for its shareholders. Reddy expects Apollo's core hospital services segment, which constitutes a little over half of the group’s revenue, to grow ""mid-teens"" in the next few years as new capacity comes online. She said the market has failed to recognise the value of the fast-growing retail and digital segments within the broader hospital conglomerate. ""If you look at the sum of the parts, we were not getting much value for this,"" Reddy said in an exclusive interview with Moneycontrol. ""We wanted Apollo shareholders to get value from this transaction,"" she added. Apollo earlier this month announced the demerger and listing of Apollo Health Technologies within the next 18 to 24 months. The new entity will consolidate the company's pharmacy business, both online and offline, with its digital health platform Apollo 24/7 and the back-end supply chain of KeyMed. Reddy said the demerged company is on a path to a significant operational turnaround, aiming to nearly double its EBITDA margin from the current 3.5 percent to 7 percent and become a Rs 25,000 crore ($3 billion) revenue business by 2027. A critical element of this strategy is the digital platform, Apollo 24/7, which is expected to stop incurring losses and achieve profitability by the end of this year. “Currently... the combined entity would have Rs 16,000 crore of revenue,"" she noted. ""If you apply 20 percent CAGR, you would get close to 25,000 minimum with a margin of 7 percent,"" by FY27. This margin improvement is expected as Apollo 24/7 turns profitable by the end of this year, and higher-margin private label products grow, she said. Private equity firm Advent holds a 12.1 percent stake, and Reddy confirmed the business is “fully capitalised” with no immediate plans for further fundraising. The new company — Apollo Health Technologies — will include online and offline pharmacies, telehealth, and backend supply chain (KeyMed). Indraprastha Apollo Hospital lease Reddy said the company is awaiting a court judgment regarding a long-standing land lease issue for its flagship Indraprastha Apollo Hospital in Delhi. The matter is currently in the Delhi High Court, with a verdict expected by the next quarter. Reddy expressed confidence in the outcome, stating, ""We've got a pretty good agreement in place. So, very optimistic about what the outcome could be"". The dispute revolves around the terms of the land lease with the Delhi government, a complex issue that has affected other prominent establishments in the city. Apollo is seeking an extension of the lease. Out of 1,202 operating bed capacity for the entire Northern region for the hospital chain, Indraprastha Apollo alone has a bed capacity of 710 beds and contributes a significant revenue share. It is one of the largest private hospitals in India and is regarded as Apollo’s flagship facility. Mumbai expansion Reddy said Apollo is planning to add a third large hospital in Mumbai and will likely announce the location in the next quarter. When asked if this new project would be a greenfield or a takeover, Reddy indicated it would be more of a partnership, citing the high cost of real estate in Mumbai and the difficulty of acquiring existing hospitals, which are often owned by trusts. ""In terms of buying over hospitals, we've really studied that (Mumbai) market. Very difficult to buy over because they're mostly owned by trusts,"" Reddy said. Apollo, which is strong in South and East, has been steadily increasing its presence in the Western region with hospitals in Pune, Nasik, and Ahmedabad. The hospital chain owns a hospital in Navi Mumbai and has acquired land in Worli to build a 500-bed greenfield hospital. M&A and growth The company is targeting mid-teen revenue growth for its core hospital services, driven by both existing facilities and a pipeline of new beds, Reddy said. She anticipates this momentum to build, forecasting ""mid-teens for definitely 15 percent to 16 percent"" year-on-year growth over the next few years as new capacity comes online, along with a focus on high-margin oncology, neurosciences, and cardiac care, which are key drivers and payer mix optimisation. Oncology alone is growing at 15–18 percent annually, supported by Apollo’s early investment in proton therapy and specialised cancer hospitals. Commenting on the profile of patients, she said that Apollo has reduced its revenue dependence on government schemes from 7–8 percent to 3–4 percent due to lower tariffs. Apollo Hospitals reported consolidated revenue of Rs 21,794 crore for FY25, marking a 14 percent year-on-year growth. The company’s consolidated EBITDA stood at Rs 3,021.9 crore, reflecting a 26 percent increase over the previous year, with an EBITDA margin of 13.9 percent. Hospitals segment, which forms the core of Apollo’s business, contributed Rs 11,147.5 crore to the total revenue — accounting for approximately 51 percent of the overall revenue. This segment also delivered EBITDA margin of 24.2 percent. A cornerstone of this growth strategy is the addition of 4,000 new beds, a move Reddy believes will supplement the 13-14 percent growth from existing hospitals. ""With the addition of these 4,000 beds that we're planning... over a three-year period, this should add another 10 percent to our revenue,"" she explained. While committed to organic expansion, Apollo is not averse to acquisitions, provided they meet stringent financial criteria. ""We have to make sure that return on capital employed currently in our older hospitals is 26 percent,"" Reddy said. ""We want to make sure that in a five-year term, it is around 19 percent post the new hospitals coming on the street"". This disciplined approach has led to strategic acquisitions, such as a hospital in Pune and brownfield projects in Kolkata and Gurgaon, Reddy said. On PE driven consolidation On the topic of private equity companies aggressively entering the Indian hospital industry, Reddy said acquiring existing hospitals is not the only way to gain market share. Reddy said Apollo has adopted a differentiated strategy aimed at leveraging synergies across its healthcare ecosystem and move closer to customers through digital platforms, pharmacies, clinics, diagnostics, and hospitals. ""We are looking at different formats of care, like daycare procedures ...the clinics where people can go for outpatient services and, of course, the tertiary portmanteau care hospitals, with our current ALOS (average length of stay) of 3-3.2 days, should mean that a 450-bed hospital is what you require in some of the micro-markets rather than moving to a 1,000-bed hospital,"" Reddy said. ""So, this strategy has given us a market share of over 30 percent in Chennai. And we believe that this is the way forward. We are looking at this in Hyderabad, Bengaluru, and Kolkata,"" Reddy said. Temasek through Manipal Hospitals and Blackstone through Quality Care and Aster DM Hospitals have been actively building large hospital chains through a string of acquisitions. Manipal Hospitals has recently pipped Apollo to become the largest hospital chain in India. Established in 1983 by Dr Prathap C Reddy with a single hospital in Chennai, Apollo Hospitals has grown to become India’s largest integrated healthcare services provider. Today, the company operates 51 hospitals, 267 clinics, and over 6,600 pharmacies, with a growing presence in diagnostics and distribution across India."

The Rs 3,395 crore public offer was priced in the band of Rs 540-570 per share, and received strong investor interest with about 64 times subscription during the offer period from July 14 to 16. Outlook for July 22 Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities After showing weakness in the last couple of sessions, Nifty shifted into a sizable bounce back on Monday and closed the day higher by 122 points. Nifty showed knee jerk action soon after the opening but was managed to display strength on the upside in the mid to later part of the session and closed at highs. A reasonable positive candle was formed on the daily chart with lower shadow. Technically, this market action indicates pullback rally in the market after the downside breakout of immediate support at 25000 levels on Friday. The negative chart pattern like lower highs and lower lows continued on the daily chart and Monday's swing low of 24882 could be considered as a new lower low of the pattern. Hence, any further upside could be a sell on rise opportunity. The short-term trend of Nifty remains weak, but a decisive move above the key overhead resistance of 25250 levels is likely to negate the bearish sentiment in the near term. Any weakness from the lower highs could revisit the recent swing low of 24882 levels. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The Nifty remained volatile during the day as traders awaited more clarity on the US-India deals. During the session, Nifty found support around the 50 EMA on the daily timeframe, leading to an intraday recovery. The RSI continued to show a bearish crossover on the daily chart, indicating weak momentum. Going forward, 24,900 remains a crucial support level for the index; a decisive fall below this level is likely to empower the bears. On the other hand, resistance is placed at 25,200–25,260.

A strong showing in midcaps added to the momentum, even as smallcaps ended flat. At close, the Sensex was up 442.61 points or 0.54 percent at 82,200.34, and the Nifty was up 122.30 points or 0.49 percent at 25,090.70.

A favourable resolution could strengthen the outlook for export-oriented sectors and enhance India’s relative attractiveness among emerging markets. Meanwhile, the continued moderation in inflation has bolstered expectations of an additional rate cut, which, if materialised, would be supportive of market sentiment. Sectoral indices on the NSE were mixed. Banking stocks led the gains, with the Nifty Private Bank index rising 1.05 percent and Nifty Bank up 0.98 percent. Nifty Metal (0.94 percent), Nifty Auto (0.44 percent), and Nifty Midcap 100 (0.46 percent) also posted healthy gains. On the flip side, selling was seen in oil & gas, FMCG, and PSU bank stocks.

Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) slipped in trade on Monday after the diversified conglomerate reported its earnings report for the quarter ended June 30, sparking bullish brokerage commentary. Reliance Industries reported a 77 percent gain in net profit for the June quarter to Rs 30,783 crore, driven by a one-time gain from divesting its stake in Asian Paints.

EBITDA rose sharply by 17% YoY. Margins expanded ~145bp YoY to 15.2%, largely due to tight control over costs (other expenses flat YoY). Store count remained flat YoY as four additions in INTUNE were offset by three closures in Beauty and one in Home Stop. Management indicated that customer footfalls improved in 1QFY26, aided by weddings and lower inflation. However, value retail is facing challenges, resulting in a reduction in INTUNE store addition guidance to 30-40 stores (vs. 40-60 earlier). We believe a profitable scale-up of INTUNE remains the key trigger for SHOP. Outlook We value SHOP at 10x Sep’27E EV/EBITDA (implies ~23x Sep’27E pre-INDAS 116 EBITDA) to arrive at our revised TP of INR510. Reiterate Neutral.

TCOM’s consol. EBITDA came in ~4% below our estimate, as data EBITDA margin contracted further ~30bp QoQ to 17.2% (-250bp YoY, 90bp miss) due to lower net revenue and rising salience of the lower-margin digital business. Management indicated that despite ongoing macroeconomic headwinds and continued pressures across the industry, TCOM’s order book recorded double-digit growth, driven by multiple million-dollar deal wins. Further, it indicated that losses in the digital portfolio have narrowed. However, we believe the improvement will likely be modest, given a 30bp QoQ decline in data EBITDA margins despite slower growth in the lowermargin Incubation segment. Outlook We value TCOM’s data business at 9.5x Sep’27 EV/EBITDA and the voice and other businesses at 5x EV/EBITDA to arrive at our revised TP of INR1,675. We reiterate our Neutral rating.

The decline was primarily driven by lower volumes and low commodity prices, offset by higher prices of silver and by-products and stronger dollar. EBITDA was down 2% YoY/20% QoQ at INR38.6b, primarily due to weak volumes and softened commodity prices. EBITDA margin contracted to 49.7% from 53% in 4QFY25 and 48.5% in 1QFY25. Zinc cost of production (CoP) stood at USD1,010/t, down 9% YoY (+2% QoQ), on account of improved metal grades and increased consumption of domestic coal and renewable energy. APAT stood at INR22.3b (-5% YoY and -26% QoQ) against our est. of INR21.5b in 1QFY26. Mined metal stood at 265kt (flat YoY and -15% QoQ), led by mine preparation activities carried out during the quarter. Refined metal production at 250kt (-5% YoY and -7% QoQ - Refined zinc/lead production of 202kt/48kt), in line with plant availability and on account of maintenance activities. Saleable silver production declined 11% YoY and 16% QoQ to 149kt, majorly due to lower silver input from SK mine and in line with lead production. Outlook At CMP, HZ trades at 7.8x FY27E EV/EBITDA, and we believe the current valuation prices in all the positive factors.

Loan book grew 7.7% YoY/declined 0.8% QoQ to INR9.46t, while deposits grew 3.6% YoY/declined 2.5% QoQ. CD ratio, thus, increased 135bp QoQ to 76.3%.

"India’s IPO market among world’s most-active, but lags US and China on proceeds",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/indias-ipo-market-among-worlds-most-active-but-lags-us-and-china-on-proceeds-13301893.html,"India’s IPO market ranks among the most active globally in terms of the number of listings, however, it lags behind the US and China in terms of total capital raised, according to the latest EY Global IPO Trends report. In the first half of 2025, India accounted for just 8% of global IPO proceeds, compared to 28% for the US and 34% for China. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates In the first six months of 2025, India saw 108 companies list, raising $4.6 billion from capital markets, which may look like a strong show but it is a 30 percent year-on-year decline in the number of IPOs. The fundraise dipped only 2 percent during the same period, suggesting that despite a slowdown in activity, the quality and size of the issues remained intact. Also Read: Tata Capital files updated confidential DRHP for IPO, says report; Tata Investment shares rise 5% This, as per the EY report, reflects a shift in strategy from both sides of the table. Issuers are being more selective about when and how they tap the markets, while investors are leaning toward companies with stronger fundamentals and clearer growth trajectories. In short - fewer, but better-quality issues. This cautious tone comes amid a backdrop of heightened global uncertainty. Geopolitical tensions and choppy macroeconomic conditions have made issuers more wary, with several high-profile companies delaying their listing plans or revise valuation expectations. Even so, the second half of the year could see a pick-up, according to EY, which said a robust pipeline is in place from sectors like technology, fintech and healthcare. Many IPO-bound companies have already received regulatory clearances and are essentially in wait mode, ready to launch as soon as market conditions turn more condusive. Read More: BSE shares rise 3% amid buzz of SEBI allowing Jane Street to resume trading India’s IPO market continues to trade at a relatively high price-to-earnings ratio of around 27x, similar to the levels seen in the US, reflecting investor confidence, but also creating added pressure for companies to justify valuations. A slow start to the year - driven by a mix of global volatility and domestic concerns - meant many deals were pushed forward. Now, signs of recovery in market sentiment are starting to show, with the retail investor interest staying committed to equities, and the regulatory environment largely supportive. With macroeconomic indicators turning more favourable - especially on inflation and liquidity - EY expects a stronger second half for primary market activities. Globally too, the IPO landscape has been a mixed bag. The US saw 109 IPOs - highest first-half count since the 2021 boom – yet raised less money overall. China, on the other hand, saw deal activity surge more than 30 percent, with proceeds rising three-fold on larger offerings and strong investor appetite. In contrast, India’s decline in volume coupled with steady IPO proceeds signal a maturing market where investors are focusing more on quality than quantity.Whether that trend changes will depend on how the rest of 2025 plays out. EY lays out two potential scenarios - in one, improving trade dynamics, easing monetary policy, and geopolitical de-escalation could help set the stage for a broader recovery in global IPO activity. On the other hand, continued macro stress - be it sticky inflation, interest rate uncertainty, or geopolitical flare-ups - could keep the market in a wait-and-watch mode. If that happens, both issuers and investors are likely to stay on the sidelines, delaying listings and ensuring valuations remain in check."

The sharp rise in the share prices pushed the Nifty Metal index up nearly 1 percent to hover around 9,545 in the afternoon. The rise was fuelled by several factors. China's dam project boosted metal prices, with iron ore and steel prices climbing to record highs. Additionally, the project may have boosted hopes for reduced dumping of cheap Chinese metals on the Indian market, which may significantly benefit the Indian players in the industry. Chinese Premier Li Qiang had launched the construction of the hydropower project on the Yarlung Tsangpo river on Saturday. The cost of the project is also four times larger than the $37-billion Three Gorges project that was completed in 2009. According to analysts, the project promises strong economic jolt for sectors like construction, cement and steel. The shares of Chinese metal companies significantly surged after the launch of the dam project. India has however raised concerns over the possibility of reduced water flow into River Brahmaputra as a result of the dam. Notably, Indian metal companies have called for strong anti-dumping duties on cheap Chinese imports for a long time now. The possibility of Chinese metal output being absorbed within the country amid higher demand during the construction of the dam may have boosted the Indian metal stocks, along with the rising metal prices. Jindal Stainless Steel (JSL) shares jumped nearly 4 percent to trade at Rs 702 apiece, while those of National Aluminium Company (NALCO) also gained nearly 4 percent to trade at Rs 195 apiece. Vedanta, Hindustan Zinc and Hindustan Copper shares gained over 2 percent each. APL Apollo Tubes shares rose nearly 2 percent, while Hindalco shares were up over 1 percent. NMDC and Adani Enterprises were up nearly 1 percent, while Steel Authority of India (SAIL), Tata Steel, Welspun Corp and Jindal Steel and Power shares were trading in the green with marginal gains. Bucking the trend, JSW Steel shares were down nearly 1 percent to hover around Rs 1,027 apiece. This comes despite the firm reporting a 155 percent surge in net profit to Rs 2,209 crore for the quarter ending June 30, 2025. Revenue from operations rose marginally on-year to Rs 43,147 crore, but fell sequentially from Rs 44,341 crore reported in the previous quarter (Q4). ""While finished steel imports have moderated, exports have fallen as well and India continues to be a net importer. Low priced imports remain a concern, accentuated by changes in global trade flows due to rising tariff uncertainties. While there has been some reduction in steel production in China in recent months, the elevated Chinese exports continue to be a challenge for the industry,"" JSW Steel said in a release.

(1) stake sale gains of Rs91.3bn on HDB listing (2) buffer provisions of Rs107bn and (2) lower tax rate at 14.7% pursuant to favorable IT order of Rs11.44bn. Buffer provisions stood at 82bps vs 96bps for ICICIB. As LDR has declined to 95% from 103.5% a year ago, focus is back on shoring up loan growth/CASA. Targeted medium term LDR is 87-90%. Bank is confident of achieving guided loan growth given strong domestic demand and upcoming festive season. For FY26/27E, we are factoring loan growth of 11%/12% YoY with an LDR of 92%/90%. PSLC cost remains a key monitorable. Outlook We maintain multiple of 2.4x on core FY27ABV but raise SOTP based TP to Rs2,150 from Rs2,125 due to increase in valuation of subsidiaries. Retain ‘BUY’.

PSLC income opportunity was not available in Q1’26 due to change in gold loan regulations. Hence, we cut fees for FY26/27E by ~10%. With RBI tweaking back gold loan regulations, agri growth may improve supporting fees. Reported NIM declined by 11bps QoQ to 2.76% due to fall in loan yields by 22bps QoQ despite a decline in corporate and increase in retail. As a result, we trim NIM for FY26/27E by 7bps/8bps to 2.53%/2.61%. Asset quality remains a silver lining with lower net slippages resulting in controlled credit costs; we GNPA expect to further improve by 92bps from 3.52% in Q1’26 to 2.6% by FY27E. Outlook With core RoA of 0.9x in FY27, stock is valued at 0.8x on Mar’27 ABV.

We expect the company’s presales to grow to +20% CAGR over FY25-27E, aided by ongoing projects and strong new launches pipeline including the Dubai JV project.

Cons volume grew 9.3% YoY aided by the ramping up of 5mtpa JVML capacity and strong domestic demand. Average cons NSR improved 7% QoQ on higher steel pricing across the regions. Decline in coking coal consumption cost by USD14/t was negated by higher shutdown costs, enabling JSTL to deliver cons EBITDA/t of Rs11,837 (adjusting for forex M2M loss of Rs3.43bn). Adj. std EBITDA/t was at Rs11,270, tad better than PLe of Rs11,087. Steel prices have started correcting since Jun due to monsoon-led weakness in demand and cheaper imports, which would impact EBITDA/t going forward. GoI is watching the imports situation and can increase and extend safeguard duty implemented earlier. We believe a) ramping up of JVML having lower conversion cost, and b) rising proportion of VAP would drive earnings growth over FY25-27E; however, concerns over SC order remains.

Pure cement realization grew by 5.5% QoQ, driven by price hikes taken in the eastern region since Mar’25. Operating costs declined due to lower RM costs (long-term contract for slag) and optimized fuel mix. This led to EBITDA/t increasing by 42% YoY to Rs1,019. The management will continue its efforts to reduce operating costs by Rs50/t in FY26 led by higher WHRS, higher AFR and lower lead distance under its Project Bridge. NUVOCO has 75% of its capacities in the East, where prices have improved in anticipation of increase in demand since Feb’25. Although monsoon-led weakness in demand is expected to hamper pricing till Sep’25, we believe price fall may not be as sharp as last year due to expectation of higher GoI infra capex and improving rural demand. Outlook We raise FY26/27E EBITDA estimates by 9%/7% on higher pricing assumption and expect EBITDA to grow at 24% CAGR on a weak base over FY25-27E.

"Tilaknagar shares rally 8 percent on favourable Bom HC ruling, ahead of board's fund raise decision",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/tilaknagar-industries-shares-rally-nearly-8-percent-ahead-of-board-s-fund-raise-decision-on-july-23-13301616.html,"Shares of Tilaknagar Industries, makers of a diverse brands of Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL), are sharply higher by over 8 percent on July 21 on very high investor interest, after the company announced that the board of the company will consider fund raising on July 23, and the Bombay High Court ruled in favour of the company in a matter relating to Allied Blenders. The fund raise will be carried out via issuance of shares, debentures, warrants, preference shares, bonds, or other instruments, Tilaknagar said, adding that the fund raise may be done in one or more tranches through the permitted routes such as a public offer, rights issue, private placement, preferential allotment, Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP), or a combination of these. On July 18, the Bombay High Court ruled in favour of Tilaknagar Industries, issuing a pan-India restraint order on Allied Blenders & Distillers (ABD) against launching 'Mansion House' and 'Savoy Club' brands, over-turning a single-bench order that had allowed the sale in West Bengal. On a YTD basis, the shares of Tilaknagar Industries are nearly flat, but over the last one month, they are higher by close to 20 percent. Tilaknagar Industries has been looking to raise funds for a potential acquisition of a whisky brand Imperial Blue from French spirit major Pernod Ricard, Moneycontrol had earlier this month, citing sources. Imperial Blue is India's third-largest whiskey brand by sales, valued at about $600-650 million. Imperial Blue was launched in India in 1997. It is Pernod Ricard's second best-selling Indian whisky, behind Royal Stag, having sold 22.8 million nine-litre cases in 2023 according to the Drinks International Millionaires’ Club. ""As of now, Tilaknagar Industries is planning to fund the proposed deal via a combination of debt and equity,"" one of the persons familiar with the development said. If the deal goes through, it will be the largest in India's alcoholic beverage space in over a decade, when Diageo bought United Spirits for $1.9 billion. Tilaknagar said it is the third largest Prestige and Above IMFL player in Karnataka, where over 80% of all IMFL consumed is whisky. ""We expect this trend of market share expansion to continue across all key states given our strong launch pipeline for the quarters ahead,"" Tilaknagar had said in May 2025. Brandy has been the dominant category for Tilaknagar, but the IMFL maker has forayed into semi-premium whisky segment with the relaunch of Mansion House Whisky in East and Northeastern states of India, and South India. ""The initial traction has been encouraging. Our mid-to-long term aim is to expand on a non-brandy portfolio through innovative launches in the growing and profitable prestige and above segment. These launches will fill up gaps in our portfolio and enable us to have a more meaningful play across the country,"" Tilaknagar recently said."

L&T to build India’s maiden green hydrogen plant at IOC's refinery,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/l-t-to-build-india-s-maiden-green-hydrogen-plant-at-ioc-s-refinery-13301389.html,"L&T Energy GreenTech, a subsidiary of Larsen & Toubro will be setting up India’s maiden green hydrogen plant at Indian Oil's Panipat refinery in Haryana on a build-own-operate basis, a company filing said on July 21. The plant will run round-the-clock using renewable energy to supply 10,000 tonnes of green hydrogen annually to IOC for 25 years, a crucial step in India's National Green Hydrogen Mission. This also aligns with IOC’s strategy to decarbonise refining operations and add to India's net-zero ambitions. At the plant, green hydrogen will be produced using high-pressure alkaline electrolysers, made at Hazira-based L&T Electrolysers. The step sets up LTEG to be a key player in the green hydrogen ecosystem, setting a precedent for industrial-scale adoption across refineries, fertilisers, and other sectors. Subramaniam Sarma, Deputy Managing Director & President, L&T said the project ""not only deepens our partnership with IOC but also reinforces our capability to deliver large-scale clean energy solutions."" Green hydrogen is essentially the hydrogen gas produced by splitting water using renewable energy sources. The project marks IOC's entry into the green hydrogen space, with India's largest-ever green hydrogen project to date. The project is slated to be commissioned by December 2027 and the green hydrogen produced here will replace fossil-derived hydrogen in IOC's refinery operations, reducing carbon emissions. Previously, IOC had cancelled two tenders, following very little interest from the industry to develop the project. The tender was first floated on September 2024, and the deadline was pushed twice to January 2025, on participating companies' insistence. ""This project reflects our end-to-end green energy capabilities — from electrolyser manufacturing to execution and operation.

CLSA has given an outperform rating, while Nomura has a buy call. Out of 52 analysts, 49 have a 'Buy' and none have suggested a 'Sell'. Technically, the Nifty remains subdued below its 10-day and 20-day exponential moving averages, both hovering near the 25,200 zone, reinforcing continued supply pressure at higher levels. The short-term structure remains in a downward trajectory. The 25,000–25,200 range has now turned into a formidable supply zone. However, as long as the index holds above the 24,800 mark, there remains a window for near-term support to hold. A decisive close above 25,200 would be required to reverse the short-term bearish tone and shift sentiment in favour of the bulls. Currently, the RSI is trending below the 50 level, underlining a lack of upside momentum and reinforcing the cautious sentiment.

Brokerages rushed to hike their target prices on the bank, expecting stronger growth in the second half of the current fiscal year. HDFC Bank posted a standalone net profit of Rs 18,155 crore for the quarter ended June 2025, marking a 12 percent rise from Rs 16,175 crore in the same period last year. Interest income for the quarter came in at Rs 77,470 crore, reflecting a 6 percent increase over the previous year. Net interest income (NII) for the quarter stood at Rs 31,438 crore, up 5.4 percent year-on-year. The bank’s core net interest margin (NIM) slipped to 3.35 percent from 3.46 percent in the March quarter, as deposit costs rose faster than yields on assets. Total operating expenses grew 4.9 percent year-on-year to Rs 17,434 crore, including Rs 6,158 crore in employee costs and Rs 11,276 crore under other overheads. At 9.16 a.m., shares of the bank were quoting Rs 1,993.2, higher by 1.8 percent on the NSE. Should you buy, sell, or hold shares of HDFC Bank? Given a fortified buffer of provisions, which is a traditional strength of HDFC Bank, likely pickup in growth and stability in NIM in H2, Nuvama Institutional Equities reiterated its 'buy' rating, with an increased target price of Rs 2,270, from Rs 2,195 earlier. Following the list of HDFC Bank's subsidiary HDB Financial Services, the bank registered one-off gains which it prudently utilized to shore-up floating/contingent provision buffer to the tune of Rs 10,700 crore, noted Emkay Global, making its balance sheet much more resilient. ""With liquidity improving, HDFC Bank guides to further accelerate growth in H2FY26, in line with the system, and outpace the system growth in FY27 and thus reduce the growth gap with large peers,"" added the brokerage. It maintained its 'buy' call; hiked the target price to Rs 2,300 per share. HDFC Bank posted a steady quarter with a slight earnings beat due to tax reversals. The NIMs contracted 11 bps QoQ and is expected to moderate further in 2Q due to the rate cut impact, according to Motilal Oswal. ""Business growth aligns with the bank’s strategy to reduce the C/D ratio consistently, though the bank indicated it would improve its credit growth trajectory moving forward,"" added the brokerage, maintaining its Rs 2,300 price target and 'buy' rating.

"Reliance Industries shares slip on reporting highest-ever profit; should you buy, sell, or hold?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/reliance-industries-shares-in-focus-on-reporting-highest-ever-profit-should-you-buy-sell-or-hold-13300606.html,"Shares of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) slipped in trade on Monday after the diversified conglomerate reported its earnings report for the quarter ended June 30, sparking bullish brokerage commentary. Reliance Industries reported a 77 percent gain in net profit for the June quarter to Rs 30,783 crore, driven by a one-time gain from divesting its stake in Asian Paints. Even after excluding the Rs 8,924 crore gain, profit was up 25 percent year-on-year, as against Rs 15,138 crore in the same quarter last year. Further, consolidated revenue rose 6 percent to Rs 2.73 lakh crore, while EBITDA climbed 36 percent to Rs 58,024 crore. Segment-wise performance Jio Platforms posted a 25 percent rise in profit to Rs 7,110 crore, with EBITDA up nearly 24 percent to Rs 18,135 crore. Net subscriber additions remained strong at 9.9 million during the quarter, taking the total to 498.1 million. Reliance Retail’s revenue rose 11.3 percent from a year earlier to Rs 84,171 crore, with EBITDA rising 12.7 percent to Rs 6,381 crore. Consumer brands under the FMCG business reported sales of Rs 11,450 crore in just their second year. The oil-to-chemicals (O2C) business saw revenue dip 1.5 percent to Rs 1.55 lakh crore from a year earlier due to lower crude prices and planned maintenance shutdowns. However, EBITDA rose 11 percent to Rs 14,511 crore due to favourable margins on domestic fuel retail, and improvements in transportation fuel cracks. On the new energy business of RIL, which is focused on building a comprehensive and integrated renewable energy ecosystem, Karan Suri, Senior Vice President, New Energy, noted that the new energy business will become a self-funded platform in a few years through its profitability and monetisation. Should you buy, sell, or hold? Motilal Oswal has maintained a ‘Buy’ rating on Reliance Industries with a target price of Rs 1,700, expecting strong growth across key segments. Reliance Jio is seen as the main driver, with the brokerage expecting a 19 percent EBITDA CAGR over FY25-28, supported by a likely tariff hike, market share gains, and continued expansion. According to the brokerage, Reliance Retail’s growth is also expected to recover, with 14-15 percent CAGR in revenue and EBITDA. A rebound in the oil-to-chemicals segment, aided by better refining margins, is likely to lift overall earnings, with RIL’s consolidated EBITDA and PAT projected to grow at an 11 percent annual average over FY25–27. Morgan Stanley maintained its ‘overweight’ rating with a target price of Rs 1,617. The broking house noted the optimistic guidance from the company, including a plan to double earnings by 2029, despite some near-term misses in retail revenue growth and fuel refining performance. Going ahead, Morgan Stanley believes that the new energy and telecom segments, along with a strong balance sheet, are key positives for RIL. Jefferies has reiterated its ‘buy’ rating on Reliance Industries with a target price of Rs 1,726. While the oil-to-chemicals (O2C) segment was impacted by a refinery shutdown, the brokerage sees a constructive outlook for refining going forward. According to Jefferies, investor focus will shift to the upcoming AGM, with hopes of a Jio listing following a likely tariff hike. The brokerage projected an EBIDTA growth for the full financial year 2026 at 11 percent. Japan-based Nomura also kept its bullish view intact, with a ‘buy’ call on Reliance Industries and a target price of Rs 1,600 per share.

"Sensex, Nifty set for tepid start amid tariff worries; key levels to track on July 21",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sensex-nifty-set-for-tepid-start-amid-tariff-worries-key-levels-to-track-on-july-21-13300591.html,"Benchmark indices Nifty and Sensex are set for a cautious start on July 21, as investor sentiment remains fragile with the August 1 trade tariff deadline looming. Early cues from the GIFT Nifty, down 0.15 percent at 24,994 around 7:45 am, point to a tepid opening. Indian equities ended the session in the red on Friday, concluding the week with losses of nearly 1 percent each, as selling pressure in banking and FMCG stocks dragged the markets lower. The broader market also remained under pressure, while a rise in India VIX reflected growing investor nervousness. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates On July 18, Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) were net buyers to the tune of Rs 374 crore worth of shares in Indian equities, while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) net bought Rs 2,103 crore worth of shares, according to provisional NSE data. Here are the important levels to watch out for in today's session Technically, the Nifty remains subdued below its 10-day and 20-day exponential moving averages, both hovering near the 25,200 zone, reinforcing continued supply pressure at higher levels. The short-term structure remains in a downward trajectory. 25,000–25,200 range has now turned into a formidable supply zone. However, as long as the index holds above the 24,800 mark, there remains a window for near-term support to hold. A decisive close above 25,200 would be required to reverse the short-term bearish tone and shift sentiment in favour of the bulls. Currently, the RSI is trending below the 50 level, underlining a lack of upside momentum and reinforcing the cautious sentiment. ""Nifty Bank is now trading below its 10-day and 20-day exponential moving averages (DEMA), both positioned near the 56,800 level, indicating persistent overhead supply and reinforcing the bearish short-term structure,"" Dhupesh Dhameja of SAMCO Securities said. ""The 56,700–56,500 zone now transitions into a strong resistance area, while immediate downside protection lies near 56,000, where large put writing activity is seen. A convincing close above 56,800 is now essential to restore bullish sentiment and trigger a reversal in structure. The RSI remains subdued below the 50-mark, confirming the absence of upward strength and supporting the current cautious outlook,"" he added. India VIX witnessed a marginal uptick of 1.33 percent, closing at 11.39, still below the psychologically important 13 mark. The persistently low volatility suggests that although bears are steadily active during intraday rallies, there is no sign of panic-driven selling yet. This indicates a controlled, measured consolidation phase rather than a full-blown capitulation. The Put-Call Ratio (PCR) has declined from 0.78 to 0.72, suggesting growing call writing pressure and a shift in option positioning lower, reinforcing the bearish sentiment. Max Pain has slipped down to 56,500, suggesting the expiry could likely gravitate around this level, consistent with the ongoing sideways-to-negative bias.

Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 920 Stop-Loss: Rs 760 SMS Pharmaceuticals | CMP: Rs 251.55 SMS Pharmaceuticals has experienced a gradual resurgence over the last few trading sessions, leading to a strong weekly close. The stock is now positioned above all its short-term EMAs and the 200-day SMA on the daily timeframe after an extended period, indicating inherent strength likely to continue in the near term. The stock has also witnessed a ‘Sloping Trendline’ breakout and is backed by a positive MACD crossover, supporting ongoing bullish momentum. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 275, Rs 285 Stop-Loss: Rs 227 Anshul Jain, Head of Research at Lakshmishree Investment Godfrey Phillips India | CMP: Rs 9,355.5 Godfrey Phillips is on the verge of a bullish breakout from a 46-day Cup and Handle pattern on the daily charts, with the breakout level near Rs 9,400. The base formation shows clear signs of institutional accumulation, supported by strong volume candles. The stock is trading in a tight range, which often precedes a large directional move. Momentum indicators have cooled off and are now well-aligned for a fresh breakout. A sustained move above Rs 9,400 could trigger a sharp uptrend in the short term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 10,300 Stop-Loss: Rs 9,000 Jubilant Pharmova | CMP: Rs 1,232 Jubilant Pharmova has broken out of a 152-day Cup and Handle pattern on the daily chart, also resembling a classic rounding base, with the breakout level at Rs 1,220. Although volumes during the breakout were subdued, the base includes multiple institutional accumulation candles, and the tight consolidation zone lends strength to the breakout structure. The breakout candle is strong and well-formed, reflecting bullish intent. Momentum indicators are catching up, and the weekly MACD has turned bullish, supporting a sustained upmove in the sessions ahead. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,400 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,145 Kellton Tech Solutions | CMP: Rs 140.18 Kellton Tech has broken out of a 24-day bullish Cup and Handle pattern, supported by a sharp volume spike — over 435% of its 50-day EMA — indicating strong institutional activity. The base was short and tight, with over three visible institutional accumulation candles, clearly showing institutional interest. The last two sessions have seen a low-volume, narrow-range pullback, which typically suggests bullish continuation. With the structure, volume, and price action aligned, the stock appears poised for a sustained upmove in the near term.

HDFC Bank aims to improve loan growth after lowering credit-to-deposit ratio,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/hdfc-bank-aims-to-improve-loan-growth-after-lowering-credit-to-deposit-ratio-13298334.html,"After sharply lowering its credit-to-deposit (CD) ratio following the merger, HDFC Bank now aims to enhance balance sheet efficiency more gradually. The management explained that the immediate priority post-merger was to shore up deposit buffers — even at the cost of CASA share — to bring the CD ratio down to more comfortable levels amid tight liquidity. Having achieved this, the bank is now looking to improve deposit quality and support higher loan growth. “We had a compulsion to bring down our CD ratio rather quickly, which we did reasonably well last year. From that low base, momentum is already visible, and we expect sequential improvement over the next three quarters,” the management said in its post-results call. ALSO READ: HDFC Bank sees stable margins ahead as rate cuts flow through gradually The lender also plans to re-energize CASA growth by deepening customer engagement and cross-selling more products, which is expected to improve funding efficiency over time. As of June 30, 2025, HDFC Bank’s gross advances stood at Rs 26.53 lakh crore, marking a 6.7 percent increase year-on-year, while total deposits rose 16.2 percent to Rs 27.64 lakh crore. The CASA ratio, however, declined to 33.9 percent from 38.2 percent in Q1FY25, with savings deposits at Rs 6.39 lakh crore and current account balances at Rs 2.98 lakh crore. Meanwhile, the bank’s capital adequacy ratio (CAR) improved to 19.88 percent from 19.33 percent a year earlier. Asset quality remained broadly stable, with the gross NPA ratio at 1.40 percent and the net NPA ratio at 0.47 percent as of June 30, slightly higher than the year-ago levels. Return on assets held steady at 0.48 percent.

HDFC Bank sees stable margins ahead as rate cuts flow through gradually,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/hdfc-bank-sees-stable-margins-ahead-as-rate-cuts-flow-through-gradually-13298298.html,"HDFC Bank expects its margins to hold steady in the coming quarters, even as the impact of recent rate cuts flows through gradually. According to the management, the repo rate cuts in February and April have already been largely reflected in the loan book, but the 50-basis-point cut in June will take longer to fully play out in earnings. “It takes about one to three months for the EBLR-linked book — which accounts for around 65–67 percent of loans — to fully reprice. Some reset monthly, others quarterly,” the bank said on its post-results analyst call. ALSO READ: HDFC Bank’s consolidated profit dips to Rs 16,258 crore despite Rs 9,128 crore gain from HDB IPO; Provisions jump to Rs 14,442 crore This lag explains why the sequential increase in yield on assets was contained to roughly 20 basis points in Q1, after adjusting for a one-off in the previous quarter. Management reiterated that margins should continue to benefit as lower rates pass through the loan book and deposits reprice over the next few quarters, supported by a mid-term deposit duration of 12–18 months. In Q1FY26, HDFC Bank’s core net interest margin (NIM) fell to 3.35 percent from 3.46 percent in the March quarter — an expected outcome given the central bank’s rate cuts earlier this year. The private lender posted a consolidated net profit of Rs 16,258 crore in the June quarter, down from Rs 16,475 crore a year ago, despite booking a one-time pre-tax gain of Rs 9,128 crore from the IPO of its subsidiary, HDB Financial Services. The subdued bottom line reflected higher provisions, which rose to Rs 14,442 crore for the quarter. These included Rs 9,000 crore in floating provisions and Rs 1,700 crore in contingent buffers, signaling a cautious stance on potential asset quality risks. Following the HDB Financial Services IPO, HDFC Bank’s stake in the subsidiary dropped to 74.19 percent as of June 30, 2025, from 94.32 percent in the prior quarter. Meanwhile, standalone net interest income (NII) grew 5.4 percent year-on-year to Rs 31,438 crore in Q1FY26.

ICICI Bank sees room for loan growth as monetary easing lifts demand sentiment,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/icici-bank-sees-room-for-loan-growth-as-monetary-easing-lifts-demand-sentiment-13298281.html,"ICICI Bank’s domestic loans grew modestly on a sequential basis in the first quarter of FY26 (Q1FY26), as global uncertainties and intense competition in low-yield segments tempered overall growth. Looking ahead, the management remains cautiously optimistic, betting on a pick-up in demand and sustained momentum in business banking and unsecured retail. ""Growth in the first quarter was moderate, reflecting global headwinds and subdued sentiment,"" the management said during its post-results analyst conference call. However, they added, “the monetary easing that began in Q4 and carried through into Q1 may gradually lift demand, and growth prospects can be reassessed after another quarter of data.” Management acknowledged that corporate and home loans — traditionally low-yield segments — continue to face stiff competition, which has weighed on loan book expansion. ALSO READ: ICICI Bank Q1 Results: Net profit jumps 15% on-year to Rs 12,768 crore, beats Street estimate On the corporate side, the bank observed a shift in borrower profile, with a decline in very high-rated (AA–) exposures and an increase in A-rated exposures, driven by pricing dynamics and borrower preferences. Management stated they remain comfortable with this risk profile, noting that the bank maintains strict controls over lower-rated exposures and evaluates corporate relationships holistically. The unsecured retail segment — including personal loans and credit cards — is also expected to contribute more meaningfully in the coming quarters. Management expressed confidence in accelerating growth in these products by ramping up customer acquisition. As of June 30, 2025, ICICI Bank’s total advances stood at Rs 13.64 lakh crore, while deposits grew by 12.8 percent year-on-year to Rs 16.08 lakh crore. The bank’s average CASA (current account and savings account) ratio remained healthy at 38.7 percent, though the capital adequacy ratio under Basel III norms edged down slightly to 16.31 percent, compared to 16.55 percent in the March quarter.

ICICI Bank sees margins to be rangebound as rate cuts impact are yet to play out,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/icici-bank-aims-to-sustain-margins-at-4-5-as-rate-cuts-impact-are-yet-to-play-out-13298141.html,"ICICI Bank's net interest margins stood at 4.3 percent in the April-June quarter (Q1FY26), in-line with the corresponding quarter last year. Going ahead, the management expects that margins would to be rangebound as recent rate cuts are yet to play out. ""The full impact of the recent rate cuts is yet to play out completely — the February and April cuts have largely flowed through the loan book already, while the June cut is expected to reflect more in Q2,"" the management said in its post-results analyst call. The management clarified that the sharp Q3–Q4 margin spike seen last year was an exception, driven partly by methodology differences and seasonal factors, and is unlikely to recur this year. ALSO READ: ICICI Bank Q1 Results: Net profit jumps 15% on-year to Rs 12,768 crore, beats Street estimate ""For Q1 FY25, margins declined as expected, primarily due to the higher number of days in the quarter, and not because of any structural unwinding,"" they added. On the funding side, the reduction in savings deposit rates and runoff of high-cost wholesale deposits have contributed to a lower cost of funds, supporting margins. The bank also highlighted that competition for deposits and loans remains manageable for now, and it will continue to focus on growing its low-cost CASA base by deepening customer relationships. The private lender reported a 15 percent year-on-year increase in net profit to Rs 12,768.21 crore for the fiscal first quarter. Net interest income (NII) — the difference between interest earned and expended — rose 8.4 percent YoY to Rs 21,634.46 crore. Asset quality improved on a yearly basis, with the gross NPA ratio declining to 1.67 percent from 2.15 percent and the net NPA ratio falling to 0.41 percent from 0.43 percent.

Broader indices outperform; these small caps rose 10-22%,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/broader-indices-outperform-these-small-caps-rose-10-22-13297647.html,"The broader indices outperformed the main indices with a gain of 1-1.5 percent amid volatility led by uncertainties in trade agreement with the US, tepid corporate earnings, persistent FII selling, better domestic macro data, and above normal monsoon. Among broader indices, the large-cap index extended the fall in the third consecutive week as it fell 0.5 percent. However, mid and small-cap indices erased previous week losses, gaining 1 percent and 1.5 percent, respectively. For the week, the BSE Sensex index shed 742.74 points or 0.90 percent to close at 81,757.73, and Nifty50 fell 181.45 points or 0.72 percent to close at 24,968.40. However, in this month till now, Sensex and Nifty declined 2 percent each. The Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their selling in the third week, as they sold equities worth Rs 6671.57 crore; however, Domestic Institutional Investors (DII) extended their buying in the 13th week as they purchased equities worth Rs 9,490.54 crore. In this month till now, FII sold equities worth Rs 16,955.75 crore, while DII bought equities worth Rs 21,893.52 crore. On the sectoral level, the BSE Bank index fell 1.3 percent, the BSE Information Technology index shed 1.2 percent, BSE Capital Goods index shed 1 percent. On the other hand, the BSE Realty index added 3.7 percent, BSE Auto index rose 1.7 percent. ""Domestic equity markets continued their protracted correction for the 3rd consecutive week and ended below the psychological level of 25k, weighed down by the broadly tepid start of Q1FY26 earnings, particularly from the IT and financial sectors. The IT sector remained under strain due to muted performance and cautious outlooks amid global demand uncertainty, while financials are also expected to report subdued results due to expected NIM contraction and asset quality concerns. In contrast, FMCG stocks outperformed, supported by encouraging growth guidance that points to a possible revival in urban consumption trends. Improved earnings momentum supported by macroeconomic tailwinds can shift investor preferences towards consumption stocks,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments. ""On the global front, markets are closely monitoring the outcome of the proposed US-India mini trade agreement. A favourable resolution could strengthen the outlook for export-oriented sectors and enhance India’s relative attractiveness among emerging markets. Meanwhile, the continued moderation in inflation has bolstered expectations of an additional rate cut, which, if materialised, would be supportive of market sentiment. As the earnings season progresses, quarterly updates from index heavyweights will be closely monitored. Strong earnings growth is vital to justify India's premium valuations,"" he added. The BSE Small-cap index rose 1.5 percent with LE Travenues Technology (IXIGO), Igarashi Motors, Navkar Corporation, John Cockerill India, Neuland Laboratories, Anand Rathi Wealth, Platinum Industries, Tilaknagar Industries, Sportking India, Allcargo Terminals, Godavari Biorefineries, Ashapura Minechem rising 15-22 percent. Where is Nifty50 headed? Amol Athawale, VP-technical Research, Kotak Securities In the last week, the benchmark indices witnessed profit booking at higher levels. On weekly charts, it has formed a bearish candle, which is largely negative. We believe that the short-term market texture is weak, but a fresh sell-off is possible only after the dismissal of 24,900/81600. Below this level, the market is likely to retest the levels of 24,600–24,500/80700-80400. On the flip side, the 50-day SMA (Simple Moving Average) or 25,050/82100 and 25,100/82300 would act as crucial resistance zones for short-term traders. If the market manages to trade above 25,100/82300, it could bounce back to the 20-day SMA or 25,320/83000. Further upside potential could lift the index up to 25,450–25,500/83400-83600. For Bank Nifty, the 50-day SMA or 56,000 would act as a key support zone, while the 20-day SMA or 56,900 could serve as a crucial resistance area for the bulls. Below 56,900, it could slip to 56,500–56,150, while above 56,900, it could move up to 57,365–57,600. The Nifty remained under selling pressure, falling towards 24,900, where it found initial support. The index stayed above the 50-day exponential moving average (50EMA) and appears poised for a short-term pullback after a sharp correction. However, it remains a ‘sell on rise’ as long as it trades below 25,260. On the downside, selling may intensify if it breaks below 24,900. Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities A reasonable negative candle was formed on the daily chart on Friday, which indicates an attempt of a downside breakout of the immediate support. The bullish chart pattern with higher tops and bottoms seems to have been negated, and we observe the beginning of a bearish chart pattern, with lower tops and bottoms formation on the daily chart. The recent swing high of 25255 could now be considered as a new lower top of the pattern. Nifty on the weekly chart formed a reasonable negative candle this week, which is the third consecutive bearish candle formation in a row. The previous sharp upside breakout of the larger range movement of last month has been negated, and the market slipped below the crucial support zone of the 25000 mark. The underlying trend of Nifty remains weak. A slide below 24900 levels could open more weakness down to 24500 in the coming week. However, any pullback rally from here could find strong overhead resistance around 25250.

SEBI nod for Jane Street’s trading comeback still awaited,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sebi-nod-for-jane-street-s-trading-comeback-still-awaited-13296538.html,"A week after Jane Street deposited Rs 4,843.5 crore in compliance with SEBI’s July 3 order, trading restrictions on the global quant firm remain, as exchanges are yet to receive a formal instruction from SEBI to lift the ban. A SEBI source said the lifting of the trading ban is “only a procedural aspect,” and there is no deliberate effort on part of the regulator to go back on its own directives. “Usually, the process involves checking lien documents on impounded assets. That’s the usual procedure. There is no other reason,” said the source familiar with the development. The July 3 interim order had directed Jane Street to deposit what SEBI termed “unlawful gains” into an escrow account. It had also stated clearly that the various restrictions—including those under Clause 62.2 restraining the firm from trading—would cease upon successful deposit of this amount. Related directives to banks, depositories, custodians, registrars, and transfer agents would also be lifted. However, Clause 62.13 of the same order directed stock exchanges to “closely monitor all future dealings and positions of the Jane Street Group on an ongoing basis” to ensure the entities do not, directly or indirectly, engage in any manipulative activity, including trading using any patterns identified in the order, until SEBI’s investigation and any subsequent proceedings are complete. While SEBI’s directive takes into account the role of stock exchanges as the first line of regulatory oversight, the talk in broking circles is about the feasibility of exchanges detecting and calling out manipulation and the trading patterns illustrated by Sebi in its order. Further guidance from SEBI is likely to be key in resolving this—something traders would expect from the regulator for added comfort. An email seeking SEBI’s comment on the matter remained unanswered. Moneycontrol had first reported on July 14 that Jane Street had deposited the Rs 4,843.5 crore in a separate escrow account, with lien marked in SEBI’s favor. SEBI confirmed the same in a press statement on Monday. Market participants had expected SEBI to issue directions to exchanges and market infrastructure institutions once the funds were deposited. However, SEBI’s press note of July 14 on Jane Street added that “They have further stated that this action has been undertaken by them without prejudice to their rights and remedies which remain available to them in law and equity”. Jane Street has since requested SEBI to lift the “conditional restrictions” imposed under the interim order and to issue appropriate directions. SEBI has said the matter is under examination in accordance with the order. The July 3 order had also directed the firm to “cease and desist” from any fraudulent, manipulative or unfair trade practice—directly or indirectly—that would violate SEBI’s regulations, including use of any patterns cited in the order. SEBI had alleged that Jane Street manipulated the market by taking cash and futures positions in constituent stocks of an index in one direction in the morning, creating an illusion of bullishness, and then taking opposite positions in index derivatives in the afternoon. SEBI described this as “deceptive and manipulative,” though Jane Street has denied the allegations. Also read: Criminal prosecution against Jane Street?

"Rare earth crisis draws PMO's attention, GMDC shares up 13% ahead of stakeholder meeting",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/pmo-likely-to-hold-meeting-on-rare-earth-magnet-crisis-with-key-stakeholders-gmdc-shares-rally-13294480.html,"Shares of PSU mining major Gujarat Mineral Development Corporation (GMDC) were sharply higher by 13 percent on July 18, after reports emerged that PMO is likely to hold a key stakeholder meeting on the rare-earth magnet crisis. Tracking the news, shares of Orissa Minerals Development Company (OMDC) too ended higher by over 8 percent. GMDC has stated intentions of entering the critical mineral space, including rare earth, and the company has been working towards this, through it has not officially disclosed details of its plans yet. The management consider rare earths as a 'value driver', as the material goes into the making permanent magnets, used in the electric vehicle supply chain. The company said in May that it has allocated approximately Rs 3,000-4,000 crore for critical mineral projects, without elaborating on further details. The electronics industry has written to the government, flagging off ‘informal sanctions’ by China on rare earth supplies and equipment, which the players believe could put the export-linked smartphone manufacturing under ‘serious risk’, CNBC-TV18 reported separately. During May and June, few automakers had flagged off risks of production, if the restricted supplies of rare earth magnet from China were not quickly restored. Magnets formed out of rare earth elements (REEs) are crucial for the automotive sector, especially electric vehicles (EVs), as well as for in the renewable energy space. To address automakers' concerns, the Centre is considering a possible relaxation of localisation norms, allowing the import of fully-built motors, newspaper Mint reported on July 18. Acknowledging this, Heavy Industries Minister HD Kumaraswamy had recently said that the Centre is working on addressing the rare earth supply issue. ""We are working on it,"" the minister had said last month. An incentive scheme for rare earth magnets too is likely being considered, in order to subsidise the domestic processing of the minerals, news reports said, quoting government officials. ""A scheme has been circulated for Rs 1,345 crore subsidy for manufacturers of rare earth magnets. It is currently under inter-ministerial consultation. It is proposed that there will be two manufacturers as of now, however this could change by the time the scheme is ready,"" Kumaraswamy had said. In June, NSA Ajit Doval and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi met in Beijing on the sideline of a SCO meeting, and reviewed bilateral relations, underscoring the need to promote an overall development. Commerce Secretary Sunil Barthwal confirmed that India is engaged with China on the issue of rare earth minerals supply, ensuring all efforts to seek uninterrupted imports. In light of China's restricted exports of rare earth elements, GMDC may emerge as a key alternative supplier. Aside of GMDC, among listed players, NMDC, Coal India, Hindustan Zinc, Vedanta, and MOIL are potential leaders in India’s rare earth ambition, and the Centre has auctioned four blocks of strategic minerals this year, though only one is focused entirely on rare earths."

Click to View More Outlook for July 21 Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities After showing minor bounce back from the support of 25K mark in the previous sessions, the Nifty witnessed sharp weakness recently and closed the day lower on Friday. A reasonable negative candle was formed on the daily chart on Friday, which indicates an attempt of downside breakout of the immediate support. The bullish chart pattern like higher tops and bottoms seems to have been negated and we observe beginning of bearish chart pattern like lower tops and bottoms formation on the daily chart. The recent swing high of 25255 could now be considered as a new lower top of the pattern. Nifty on the weekly chart formed a reasonable negative candle this week, which is third consecutive bearish candle formation in the trot. The previous sharp upside breakout of larger range movement of last month has been negated and the market slipped below the crucial support zone of 25000 mark. The underlying trend of Nifty remains weak. A slide below 24900 levels could open more weakness down to 24500 in the coming week. However, any pullback rally from here could find strong overhead resistance around 25250. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The Nifty remained under selling pressure, falling towards 24,900 where it found initial support. The index stayed above the 50-day moving average (50DMA) and appears poised for a short-term pullback after a sharp correction. However, it remains a ‘sell on rise’ as long as it trades below 25,260. On the downside, selling may intensify if it breaks below 24,900.

"Waaree Energies, Premier Energies, SW Solar shares fall up to 4% as US firms request tariffs on imports from India",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/waaree-energies-premier-energies-sw-solar-shares-fall-up-to-4-as-us-firms-request-tariffs-on-imports-from-india-13295119.html,"The shares of Indian solar module manufacturers dropped in trade on July 18, after their US peers filed new trade petitions against India, Indonesia and Laos, seeking more anti-dumping and countervailing duties on the imports to US. The Alliance for American Solar Manufacturing and Trade accused these companies of dumping cheap goods in the market to undercut new American factories. The group includes Tempe, Arizona-based First Solar, Qcells, the solar division of Korea's Hanwha, and private companies Talon PV and Mission Solar. The American firms have accused their foreign rivals of receiving unfair government subsidies and selling their products below the cost of production in US, hampering the home-grown companies there. ""We have always said, vigorous enforcement of our trade laws is critical to the success of this industry,"" Tim Brightbill, lead attorney for the petitioners, said in a statement. Notably, most of the solar panels installed in US are made overseas. Indian solar panel makers derive a major portion of their revenue from US exports. If the petitions are accepted, the margins of these Indian players may be hampered. Waaree Energies shares dropped around 2.5 percent to trade at Rs 3,127 apiece. Premier Energies shares meanwhile fell nearly 1.4 percent to trade at Rs 1,065 apiece. Sterling and Wilson Renewable Energy (SW Solar) shares meanwhile tumbled over 4 percent to trade at Rs 321 apiece. Notably, this comes a day after the company released its results for the first quarter of the financial year 2026. SW Solar had reported a net profit of Rs 31 crore for Q1 FY26, marking a multi fold jump from the Rs 4 crore net profit reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year. Revenue from operations also more than doubled in a year to Rs 1,762 crore.

Highlights: (1) Polycab reported strong double-digit growth across cable and wire and FMEG segments. Growth in cables and wires is led by higher government expenditure, better project execution and superior revenue mix. Cables continued to outpace wires. Additionally, its international business revenues grew 24% YoY. (2) Fans segment saw a muted performance due to unseasonal rainfall; however, solar products’ growth doubled YoY. (3) EBIT margin expansion is supported by a move towards premium products and operating leverage. (4) We model the ongoing infrastructure/ capex cycle to continue to create multiple growth opportunities. Increase in manufacturing of electronics as well as backward integration also creates additional tailwinds. (5) Sustained profitability of FMEG business also augurs well for long term EVA creation.

Axis, in its Q4FY25 call, without quantifying, had mentioned that it has tightened the upgrade and classification criteria (technical impact), which could adversely impact asset quality outcomes. The technical impact on gross slippages (INR 27.1bn), net slippages (INR 18.6bn) and credit costs (INR 8bn) is: 1) higher than our estimates; and more importantly 2) difficult to comprehend, in our view. Gross/net slippages jumped to ~3.1%/2.3% annualised, while credit costs spiked to 1.5%. RoA moderated to 1.5%, cushioned by treasury/fee and muted opex. NIM declined ~17bps QoQ to 3.8% and the bank retains its ‘through the cycle’ guidance of 3.8%. Axis now aims for outpacing the industry on loan growth in FY26 and continued muted opex in the near term. Retain BUY on valuations. Outlook We cut our target multiple to ~1.65x (~1.8x earlier); TP revised to INR 1,370 (INR 1,470 earlier). Maintain BUY on valuations, though we believe that the stock’s returns are likely to be back-ended.

The resilient Q1FY26 performance, which saw demand being impacted by domestic/international geopolitical factors, augurs well for the remainder of FY26. We believe that with industry tailwinds of demand continuing to outpace supply over FY25-29E, the company’s goal of doubling revenue by 2030 assuming high single-digit RevPAR growth is realistic and achievable (I-sec estimate of 8% standalone RevPAR CAGR over FY25-27E). Outlook We retain our BUY rating with a revised SoTP-based TP of INR 941 (earlier: INR 979) owing to a marginal cut in subsidiary level FY26/27E EBITDA of 2–3%, retaining Mar’27E EV/EBITDA multiple of 33x.

Buy HDFC Asset Management Company; target of Rs 5700: Prabhudas Lilladher,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-hdfc-asset-management-company-target-of-rs-5700-prabhudas-lilladher-13294409.html,"Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on HDFC Asset Management Company HDFCAMC saw a strong quarter as core income was 1.8% more than PLe due to revenue being 2.7% higher. Revenue yields were better at 46.7bps (PLe 45.5bps) as (1) equity mix improved QoQ to 60.3% from 59.9% due to equity market bounce back in Q1FY26 (2) commission rationalization and (3) likely more flows in higher yielding older AuM. Strong equity performance in the 3-yr bucket is driving net flows’ market share of 15.0% in Q1FY26. Due to new ESOP scheme of 2.5mn shares, we raise staff cost for FY26/27E by 2%/4%. Although a bit volatile initially, equity markets have delivered strong returns in Q1FY26 while industry equity flows have improved to Rs314bn in Jun’25 from Rs272bn in Mar’25. Outlook Owing to strong MTM impact of 10.1% in Q1FY26 CLAuM and uptick in flows, we raise core EPS for FY26/27E by avg. 4.2%, increase multiple to 42x from 35x and raise TP to Rs5,700 from Rs4,600.

The sharp fall in the share prices pushed the Nifty India Defence index down around 2.2 percent to hover around 8,173 in the afternoon. The defence index has now extended losses to the third consecutive session. It has recorded decline in six out of seven straight sessions. The defence stocks saw significant rally earlier this year, but analysts now flag high valuations. The shares of the companies came in focus on hopes of higher order inflows, after the Indian military conducted targeted strikes against terrorist outfits in Pakistan under the codename 'Operation Sindoor' in May. As the geopolitical tensions between India and Pakistan eased, the escalations in Russia-Ukraine war continued to support the rally in defence stocks. The rise in tensions between Israel and Iran further boosted the stocks. However, as geopolitical tensions around the globe continue to ease, the defence stocks declined. Bharat Dynamics (BDL) and Data Patterns shares were the top losers on the index, falling nearly 5 percent and over 4 percent respectively. BEML and Astra Microwave Products shares fell over 3 percent each. Cochin Shipyard and Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) shares followed, declining over 2 percent each, while Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders, Bharat Electronics (BEL) and Solar Industries shares fell more than 1.5 percent each. Paras Defence and Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers (GRSE) shares fell more than 1 percent each.

Buy Marico; target of Rs 810: Emkay Global Financial,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-marico-target-of-rs-810-emkay-global-financial-2-13294324.html,"Emkay Global Financial' research report on Marico However, the company’s near-term performance is likely to be impacted by the inflationary copra prices in both, India and Indonesia. Amid unprecedented surge in copra prices, Marico’s nearterm margin in India (1/3rd of revenue) and in Bangladesh (3/5th of revenue) is likely to be stressed. However, we expect cyclical pressures to ebb with improvement in market supplies in coming months, in line with management expectations. We uphold our expectations of a margin recovery in 2H, wherein the company is likely to manage growth with better volumes and improved margins; this would lead to double-digit earnings growth. We see risk to our margin and growth assumptions for FY26E, if the copra price inflation persists. Outlook We maintain our long-term positive view on Marico with Jun-26E TP of Rs810 (on 50x P/E), given improved execution.

Buy Axis Bank; target of Rs 1400: Emkay Global Financial,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-axis-bank-target-of-rs-1400-emkay-global-financial-4-13294271.html,"Emkay Global Financial' research report on Axis Bank The in-line NII and higher treasury income notwithstanding, Axis Bank reported a 10% miss on PAT (at Rs58bn) and 1.5% RoA, primarily due to significantly higher provisions as it tweaked its stress recognition policy on cash credit/overdraft (CC/OD) facility and owing to one-time settlement accounts. Adjusted for this technical impact, 1Q PAT is likely log at ~Rs64bn. Though the management had earlier given guidance for this policy change to ensure industry-best prudency, the extent of NPA formation is higher than expected. The management indicated that 1Q bore the impact of the stock plus flow, and so slippages during 9MFY26 should be relatively moderate (albeit elevated), as also the credit cost. Factoring this in, we cut FY26E/FY27E/FY28E earnings by 7%/3%/1%; we expect the RoA to dip to 1.6% in FY26E and gradually recover to 1.7%. The stock has already corrected recently and is trading at cheap valuations of 1.4x FY27E ABV/1.2x FY28E ABV. Outlook Hence, we retain BUY on Axis while maintaining our TP at Rs1,400, rolling forward the standalone bank valuation on 1.6x Jun-27E ABV and subs at Rs125/sh.

Reduce Wipro; target of Rs 280: Emkay Global Financial,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/reduce-wipro-target-of-rs-280-emkay-global-financial-13294104.html,"Emkay Global Financial' research report on Wipro Wipro reported steady operating performance in Q1, though one-off restructuring costs led to a miss on reported EBITM. IT Services revenue declined 0.3% QoQ to USD2.59bn (down 2% CC), in line with our expectations. Overall EBITM declined by 120bps QoQ due to one-off restructuring costs of ~Rs2.5bn in Europe, missing our estimates, while EBITM for IT Services matched our expectations. Deal intake remained strong at ~USD5bn in Q1 (includes large-deal bookings worth ~USD2.7bn), with book-to-bill of 1.9x. The management gave revenue growth guidance of -1% to 1% CC QoQ in Q2, in line with our estimates. While macro and geopolitical uncertainty remains elevated, the management is confident of growth acceleration in H2 on the back of strong deal intake, robust deal pipeline, and improved execution rigor. The management indicated pressure on margins in the near term due to anticipated ramp up of competitively-priced large deals and initial investments in such deals, although it refrained from quantifying the overall impact. We prefer to wait for clarity on the margin trajectory before taking a more constructive view. Outlook We trim FY26-28E EPS by ~1%, factoring in the Q1 performance; retain REDUCE with TP of Rs280 at 20x Jun-27E EPS.

Broader selling was also seen across insurance and NBFC stocks. Shares of Axis Bank slipped as much as 6.36 percent to Rs 1,086 on the NSE after the private lender reported a 3 percent year-on-year drop in its consolidated net profit to Rs 6,243.72 crore for the first quarter of FY26. The decline was attributed to changes in norms related to non-performing assets and loan upgrade policies. Sensex slips 600 pts, Nifty below 24,950: Weak Axis Bank Q1 earnings among key factors behind market decline The stock, which opened lower by 6.02 percent, pared some losses by midday to trade at Rs 1,114.20, down 3.93 percent. Axis Bank shares have now fallen for two straight sessions. ""Axis Bank’s results came below market expectations, leading to pressure on the stock. Its GDR also dropped 4.8 percent to USD 64.30 on Thursday, reflecting concerns over asset quality,"" said Devarsh Vakil, Head of Prime Research, HDFC Securities. Axis Bank Q1 results: Net profit declines 4% to Rs 5,806 crore, NII marginally up The weak earnings triggered broader selling in the banking sector, pulling the Nifty Bank index down over 1 percent in intraday trade—its second consecutive session of losses. Eleven out of the twelve Nifty Bank constituents were in the red, with only IndusInd Bank trading higher, up 1 percent. Among other laggards in the banking space were Kotak Mahindra Bank, State Bank of India, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, and IDFC First Bank, which declined up to 1.5 percent. The weakness also extended to insurance and NBFC stocks. Bajaj Finserv, LIC Housing Finance, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, HDFC Life, Shriram Finance, and SBI Life fell up to 2 percent.

Buy Axis Bank; target of Rs 1375: Prabhudas Lilladher,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-axis-bank-target-of-rs-1375-prabhudas-lilladher-13294073.html,"Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Axis Bank AXSB saw a weak quarter yet again as core PAT missed PLe by 26.6% due to asset quality related technical impact of Rs6.14bn. Adjusting for the same, core PAT missed PLe by 17% owing to lower NIM and fees. Owing to more stringent recognition criteria, gross slippages were more by Rs27.1bn (one-time impact). In our view, this may also reflect the underlying stress. As bank does not intend to further change the recognition policy, upcoming quarters of FY26 and FY27 would see lower credit costs since stress is moderating in PL/CC. Outlook We raise provisions for FY26 by 8bps but reduce it for FY27E by 3bps. For FY26/27E, we cut NIM by 6bps and trim fees by avg. ~2.0%; core PAT is lower by 5.1%/2.6%. Due to 7bps reduction in core RoA for FY26 to 1.4%, we tweak multiple to 1.8x from 1.9x and cut TP to Rs1,375 from Rs1,500. Retain ‘BUY’.

For the June quarter, Clean Science’s revenue rose 8 percent year-on-year to Rs 240 crore, while Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) grew 5 percent over the same period to Rs 100 crore. Margins for the quarter contracted by 100 basis points to 41.7 percent compared to 42.8 percent a year ago, while net profit increased by 6 percent year-on-year. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog Over 25 percent of the company’s revenue during the quarter came from newer product launches, and the management noted that the company also gained market share in this period. However, the company revised its EBITDA growth guidance to 15–18 percent (down from the earlier 18–20 percent) citing softness in the first quarter of FY26 and global headwinds. Management said it expects a stronger ramp-up starting Q3FY26, with revenue acceleration in the second half of FY26 driven by new product launches, improved capacity utilisation, operating leverage, and market expansion. The promoters of Clean Science, who currently hold a 74.97 percent stake in the company, are evaluating the sale of a minority stake as part of their family estate planning and management, the management shared during the earnings call. Motilal Oswal reiterated its ""neutral"" rating on the stock, with a target price of Rs 1,350 per share. The brokerage cut its FY26 and FY27 estimates by 9 percent each, citing higher tax rates, but expects a revenue, EBITDA, and PAT CAGR of 23 percent, 23 percent, and 27 percent, respectively, over FY25–27. Meanwhile, HDFC Securities maintained a ""sell"" rating with a target price of Rs 1,029 per share. The brokerage said it expects the return on equity (RoE) to remain around 20 percent and EPS to grow at an 18 percent CAGR between FY25 and FY29. HDFC Securities noted that valuations remain high at 48x and 41x FY26 and FY27 estimated EPS, respectively. It added that Q1 EBITDA was 8 percent below its estimates, while PAT was 9 percent below expectations due to lower-than-expected revenue.

The sequential dip in topline was due to lower sales of newer products such as DCC and TBHQ. The Pharma & Agro Intermediates segment witnessed the sharpest decline, with revenue down 32% QoQ. Volume for the company’s established products remained strong, supporting a robust standalone EBITDAM of 46%, driven by lower raw material costs. HALS volume stood at 540tn. The management reiterated its guidance of 4,500tn for HALS volume in FY26, with new HALS grades priced at USD11–35/kg expected to be launched over the coming quarters. HALS is likely to break even at the EBITDA level by Q2FY26, with monthly sales expected to reach Rs100mn. The HALS subsidiary reported EBITDA loss of Rs80mn in Q1FY26. On the capex front, water trials at Performance Chemicals 1 are scheduled for Aug’25, with commercialization of the facility targeted for Sep. Performance Chemicals 2 is on track for commercialization in Q4FY26. Looking ahead, these new capacity additions are expected to be key growth drivers. Outlook However, the company’s margin profile may face some pressure, as certain new products such as HALS are expected to yield lower profitability compared to the legacy portfolio. At its current valuation of 41x FY27 EPS, we maintain ‘HOLD’ rating on CLEAN, with target price of Rs1,425 valuing it at 40x FY27 EPS.

The discretionary budgets were tight in Consumer and Manufacturing, especially in Europe, otherwise AI-led transformation and modernization of data witnessed steady recover in Q1. The exceptional large deal TCV (including 2 mega deals) is a mix of both renewals and NN. The large wins are a strategic outcome of securing the existing books while building new offerings on top. However, the nature of the deals is concentrated more on the vendor consolidation and cost optimization side, which ideally comes at a higher tenure and lower margins. The early part of the deals would require investments in right sizing the talent base and setting up stage for deployment, which ultimately leads to take a hit on the margins.

Asian markets are mixed and Japan's shares slip after election leaves Ishiba's future in doubt,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/asian-markets-are-mixed-and-japans-shares-slip-after-election-leaves-ishibas-future-in-doubt-2025-07-21/,"BANGKOK (AP) — Asian shares were mixed on Tuesday after U.S. stock indexes inched to more records at the start of a week of profit updates from big U.S. companies. Japan’s benchmark surged and then fell back as it reopened from a holiday Monday following the ruling coalition's loss of its upper house majority in Sunday's election. The Nikkei 225 shed 0.3% to 39,694.89. Analysts said the market initially climbed as investors were relieved that Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba vowed to stay in office despite the setback. But the election's outcome has added to political uncertainty and left his government without the heft needed to push through legislation. A breakthrough in trade talks with the U.S. might win Ishiba a reprieve, but so far there's been scant sign of progress in negotiating away the threat of higher tariffs on Japan's exports to the U.S. beginning Aug. 1. “Relief may be fleeting. Ishiba’s claim to leadership now rests on political duct tape, and history isn’t on his side. The last three LDP leaders who lost the upper house didn’t last two months,” Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. Elsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.3% to 25,057.11, while the Shanghai Composite index also was up 0.3%, at 3,568.78. South Korea's Kospi sank 1.4% to 3,165.40, with investors concerned over the Aug. 1 deadline for making a deal with U.S. President Donald Trump or facing 25% tariffs on all the country's exports to the U.S. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 was little changed at 8,666.30. India's Sensex gained 0.3%, while the SET in Thailand was up less than 0.1%. Many of Trump’s stiff proposed tariffs are paused after he extended the deadline for talks to allow more time to reach potential trade deals that could lower those rates. Aug. 1 is the next big deadline, at least for now. U.S. stock indexes inched their way to more records on Monday to kick off a week full of profit updates from big U.S. companies. General Motors will report its latest profit results later this week, along with such market heavyweights as Alphabet, Coca-Cola and Tesla. The S&P 500 rose 0.1% to 6,305.60 and squeaked past its prior all-time high set on Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged down less than 0.1% to 44,323.07. The Nasdaq composite added 0.4% to its own record, closing at 20,974.17. Verizon Communications helped lead the way and rose 4%. The telecom giant reported a stronger profit and higher revenue for the latest quarter than expected and raised its forecasts for the full year. That helped offset a 5.4% drop for Sarepta Therapeutics, which continued to fall after the Food and Drug Administration said on Friday that it asked the company to voluntarily stop all shipments of Elevidys, its gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, due to safety concerns. Block, Jack Dorsey’s company behind Square, Cash App and other tech brands climbed 7.6% in its first trading after learning it will join the widely followed and imitated S&P 500 index. It will take the place of Hess, which Chevron bought, before trading begins on Wednesday. Cleveland-Cliffs rallied 12.4% after the steel producer reported a smaller loss for the spring than analysts expected. It shipped a record 4.3 million net tons of steel during the quarter, and CEO Lourenco Goncalves said the company has begun to see “the positive impact that tariffs have on domestic manufacturing” and other things. It’s a major supplier to the auto industry, and Trump’s tariffs steer companies hoping to sell cars in the United States toward steel made in the country. In other dealings early Tuesday, U.S. benchmark crude oil lost 71 cents to $65.24 per barrel, while Brent crude, the international standard, gave up 69 cents to $68.52 per barrel. The U.S. dollar rose to 147.62 Japanese yen from 147.38 yen. The euro slipped to $1.1691 from $1.1696. ___ AP Business Writers Matt Ott and Stan Choe contributed.

Can you ever expect privacy in public? Coldplay kiss camera saga tells us a lot about the answer,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/can-you-ever-expect-privacy-in-public-coldplay-kiss-camera-saga-tells-us-a-lot-about-the-answer-2025-07-21/,"NEW YORK (AP) — When the “KissCam” at a Coldplay concert landed on a couple who tried (but failed) to duck out of the spotlight, the internet immediately got to work. In hours, the clip was just about everywhere. Endless memes, parody videos and photos of the pair's shocked faces filled social media feeds. Online sleuths rushed to identify who was on camera. Artificial intelligence and software company Astronomer eventually confirmed that its CEO and chief people officer were in fact the couple in the video — and announced the CEO's resignation over the weekend. The incident's fallout has, of course, generated conversations about business ethics, corporate accountability and the repercussions that conflicts of interest among leadership can cause. But there are also broader implications at play in our increasingly online world — about the state of potentially being visible everywhere you go or tracked through “social media surveillance."" Experts say it's more and more common for moments that may have been intended to be private, or at least reserved to a single physical venue, to make their way online and even go global today. So in the era of lightning-fast social sharing and when cameras are practically inescapable, does being in public hold any expectation of privacy anymore? Is every experience simply fodder for the world to see? It's no secret that cameras are filming much of our lives these days. From CCTV security systems to Ring doorbells, businesses, schools and neighborhoods use ample video surveillance around the clock. Sporting and concert venues have also filmed fans for years, often projecting playful bits of audience participation to the rest of the crowd. In short, the on-scene viewer becomes part of the product — and the center of attention. And of course, consumers can record just about anything if they have a smartphone in their pocket — and, if it's enticing to other social media users, that footage can quickly spread through cyberspace. Ellis Cashmore, author of the book “Celebrity Culture,” proposes that the rapid fame of last week’s KissCam moment probably answers a question many have been asking for years: “Is the private life still what it was? And the answer is, of course, there’s no such thing as the private life anymore,” he notes. “Certainly not in the traditional sense of the term.” “I’m not sure that we can assume privacy at a concert with hundreds of other people,” adds Mary Angela Bock, an associate professor in the University of Texas at Austin’s School of Journalism and Media. “We can’t assume privacy on the street anymore.” Some version of the KissCam has long been a staple at big events — from timeouts during sports games to romantic songs played by artists at their concerts. It’s easy to miss, but most venues have signs to inform the audience that they could be filmed during the event. What’s been different in more recent years, experts note, is how quickly those moments can travel beyond the physical space where they actually unfold. That isn’t only limited to what shows up on a jumbotron. Sometimes it only takes one person in the crowd to capture any interaction on their phone and post the video online — where it can zip around the world. “It’s not just the camera,"" Bock says. “It’s the distribution system that is wild and new.” Then there's the second ring of exposure — what happens after the video or photos spread. Experts point to growing instances of social media users rushing to publicly identify, or dox, the people captured on camera — much like how quickly the internet committed to finding those involved in the Coldplay moment, for example. The LinkedIn pages belonging both to Astronomer’s now-former CEO and chief people officer remained disabled on Monday, and The Associated Press could not reach either for comment. But it isn't limited to company executives. Beyond someone simply spotting a familiar face and spreading the word, technological advances — including AI — have made it easier and faster overall to find just about anyone in an online post. This can happen with videos and photos shared on social media each day, even if it doesn't go viral, experts warn. “It’s a little bit unsettling how easily we can be identified with biometrics, how our faces are online, how social media can track us — and how the internet has gone from being a place of interaction, to a gigantic surveillance system,"" Bock says. “When you think about it, we are being surveilled by our social media. They’re tracking us in exchange for entertaining us.” And of course, such moments can also impact people who were not actually on camera. As easy as it can be to be identified online today, the internet is notorious for cutting a broad swath or not always getting it right. That sometimes produces harassment of individuals not actually involved. At last week's Coldplay concert, for example, many social media users speculated that a third person seen near the two caught on camera was another Astronomer employee — leading to swarms of posts targeting her. But the company later confirmed that she was not at the event and said no other employees were in the video circulating online. For the now-viral moment, “we can talk about what’s right and wrong, and whether they deserved it,” says Alison Taylor, a clinical associate professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business. Still, it’s a “very frightening thing to get a lot of abuse and harassment online,” Taylor notes. “There are real human beings behind this.” It’s hard to think that that these kind of viral moments will ever go away — and there are few legal restrictions to stop users from sharing clips of interactions recorded from anything from a concert to the street widely online. But on an individual level, Bock says it can be helpful to “think before you share” and question whether something’s really accurate. “Social media has changed so much,” Bock says. “But we really have not, as a society, caught up with the technology in terms of our ethics and our etiquette.” ___ Associated Press journalists Hilary Fox and Kelvin Chan contributed to this report."
Banishing a reporter: Trump escalates battle with Wall Street Journal over Epstein story,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/banishing-a-reporter-trump-escalates-battle-with-wall-street-journal-over-epstein-story-2025-07-21/,"President Donald Trump on Monday followed up his lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal over last week's Jeffrey Epstein story by banishing one of the newspaper's reporters from Air Force One for an upcoming Scotland trip. The moves reflect Trump's aggressiveness toward media who displease him — even a media magnate, Rupert Murdoch, with outlets that have been friendly to him in the past. Trump filed a $10 billion defamation lawsuit against the Journal and Murdoch on Friday because of the newspaper's article about a sexually suggestive letter bearing Trump's name that was included in a 2003 album compiled for alleged sex trafficker Epstein's birthday. The president has denied having anything to do with it. On Monday, the White House said it was removing a Journal reporter from the pool covering the president's trip this weekend to his golf courses in Turnberry and Aberdeen in Scotland. The Journal's Tarini Parti had been scheduled to cover him on the trip. “Due to the Wall Street Journal's fake and defamatory conduct, they will not be one of the thirteen outlets on board,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. The Journal declined comment on the action. It's a tactic the Trump White House has used before. It restricted the access of journalists from The Associated Press to press events when the news outlet would not change its style guidelines to reflect Trump's renaming of the Gulf of Mexico. That launched a legal battle that is wending its way through the courts. The defamation lawsuit is another tool Trump has used against media outlets. He has sued CBS News for its editing of a “60 Minutes” interview with former opponent Kamala Harris; ABC News for a false statement made by George Stephanopoulos in a story regarding a New York writer who had accused Trump of sexual abuse; and Meta after it removed Trump's social media accounts following the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. In each of those cases, Trump won multimillion-dollar settlements. But in those instances, news was only one part of a major corporation's business. In the case of Murdoch and News Corp., news is the chief part of his business. The Journal has vowed to fight. It's also the first time Trump has sued for defamation as a sitting president, and it's not clear whether any president has done that in the past. “There’s nothing inherently wrong with a president bringing a libel suit,” said noted free speech attorney Floyd Abrams. “But this claim certainly seems like nothing more or less than an effort to suppress speech that our president finds discomforting. That’s not why we have libel law. It’s why we have a First Amendment.” It's all part of a broader pattern of trying to intimidate news organizations that report stories Trump does not like, said Jameel Jaffer, executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University. “These are lawsuits that have no hope of actually succeeding as lawsuits, but nevertheless have the potential to chill media organizations from doing what all of us need them to do,” Jaffer said. Not every news organization has bowed down; “60 Minutes,” in fact, did some notably tough stories about the early days of Trump's second administration. But it's impossible to quantify stories that weren't done because of fear of a fight with the White House, he said. The Wall Street Journal leans conservative editorially, but hasn't been afraid to take Trump on in both its opinion and news sections. Other Murdoch outlets — Fox News Channel and the New York Post — are much friendlier to him. Ever since the administration announced that it would not be releasing additional government files from the case against Epstein, factions of Trump's base supporters have turned on him. That has put some normally supportive news outlets in a difficult position. Fox News largely avoided the story after Trump suggested his allies stop wasting time on it. But Fox's Howard Kurtz reported on The Wall Street Journal lawsuit on his “Media Buzz” show Sunday, saying that by doing so, “the president has drawn extra attention to the Journal's reporting.” The president's battle with the press has taken on several dimensions. He has been fighting to take away government support for news organizations like Voice of America, and last week the Republican-controlled Congress voted to take away federal funding from NPR and PBS because the president says their news programming is biased against conservatives. ___ David Bauder writes about the intersection of media and entertainment for the AP.

Looming over two cases threatening Musk's car company is a single question: Can he be trusted?,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/looming-over-two-cases-threatening-musks-car-company-is-a-single-question-can-he-be-trusted-2025-07-21/,"MIAMI (AP) — Elon Musk fought court cases on opposite coasts Monday, raising a question about the billionaire that could either speed his plan to put self-driving Teslas on U.S. roads or throw up a major roadblock: Can this wildly successful man who tends to exaggerate really be trusted? In Miami, a Tesla driver who has admitted he was wrong to reach for a dropped cell phone moments before a deadly accident, spoke of the danger of putting too much faith in Musk's technology — in this case his Autopilot program. “I trusted the technology too much,” said George McGee, who ran off the road and killed a woman out stargazing with her boyfriend. “I believed that if the car saw something in front of it, it would provide a warning and apply the brakes.” In unusual coincidence, regulators arguing an Oakland, California, case tried to pin exaggerated talk about the same Tesla technology at the center of a request to suspend the carmaker from being able to sell vehicles in the state. Musk's tendency to talk big — whether it's his cars, his rockets or his government costing-cutting efforts — have landed him in trouble with investors, regulators and courts before, but rarely at such a delicate moment. After his social media spat with President Donald Trump, Musk can no longer count on a light regulatory touch from Washington. Meanwhile, sales of his electric cars have plunged and so a hit to his safety reputation could threaten his next big project: rolling out driverless robotaxis — hundreds of thousands of them — in several U.S. cities by the end of next year. The Miami case holds other dangers, too. Lawyers for the family of the dead woman, Naibel Benavides Leon, recently convinced the judge overseeing the jury trial to allow them to argue for punitive damages. A car crash lawyer not involved in the case, but closely following it, said that could cost Tesla tens of millions of dollars, or possibly more. “I’ve seen punitive damages go to the hundreds of millions, so that is the floor,” said Miguel Custodio of Los Angeles-based Custodio & Dubey. “It is also a signal to other plaintiffs that they can also ask for punitive damages, and then the payments could start compounding.” That Tesla has allowed the Miami case to proceed to trial is surprising. It has settled at least four deadly accidents involving Autopilot, including payments just last week to a Florida family of a Tesla driver. That said, Tesla was victorious in two other jury cases, both in California, that also sought to lay blame on its technology for crashes. Lawyers for the plaintiffs in the Miami case argue that Tesla’s driver-assistance feature, called Autopilot, should have warned the driver and braked when his Model S sedan blew through flashing lights, a stop sign and a T-intersection at 62 miles-an-hour in an April 2019 crash. Tesla said that drivers are warned not to rely on Autopilot, or its more advanced Full Self-Driving system. It says the fault entirely lies with the ""distracted driver"" just like so many other “accidents since cellphones were invented.” Driver McGee settled a separate suit brought by the family of Benavides and her severely injured boyfriend, Dillon Angulo. McGee was clearly shaken when shown a dashcam video Monday of his car jumping a Key West, Florida, road and hitting a parked Chevrolet Tahoe which then slammed into Benavides and sent her 75 feet through the air to her death. Asked if he had seen those images before, McGee pinched his lips, shook his head, then squeaked out a response, “No.” Tesla's attorney sought to show that McGee was fully to blame, asking if he had ever contacted Tesla for additional instructions about how Autopilot or any other safety features worked. McGee said he had not, though he was heavy user of the features. He said he had driven the same road home from work 30 or 40 times. Under questioning, he also acknowledged he alone was responsible for watching the road and hitting the brakes. Summarizing the testimony, Tesla said in a statement after the court adjourned that McGee had ""stated the simple truth that we all know: If he had just paid attention to the road instead of searching for his dropped cell phone and pressing the accelerator —which he was doing for over a minute before the crash — this tragic accident would never have happened.” But lawyers for the Benavides family had a chance in the courtroom at parrying that line of argument, asking McGee if he would have taken his eyes off the road and reached for his phone had he been driving any car other than a Tesla on Autopilot. McGee responded, “I don’t believe so.” The case is expected to continue for two more weeks. In the California case, the state's Department of Motor Vehicles is arguing before an administrative judge that Tesla has misled drivers by exaggerating the capabilities of its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features. A court filing claims even those feature names are misleading because they offer just partial self-driving Musk has been warned by federal regulators to stop making public comments suggesting Full Self-Driving allows his cars to drive themselves because it could lead to overreliance on the system, resulting in possible crashes and deaths. He also has run into trouble with regulators for Autopilot. In 2023, the company had to recall 2.3 million vehicles for problems with the technology and is now under investigation for saying it fixed the issue though it’s unclear it has, according to regulatory documents. The California case is expected to last another four days. ___ Condon reported from New York."
"Budget office says Trump's tax law will add $3.4 trillion to deficits, leave 10 million uninsured",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/budget-office-says-trumps-tax-law-will-add-34-trillion-to-deficits-leave-10-million-uninsured-2025-07-21/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's tax and spending law will add $3.4 trillion to federal deficits through 2034, the Congressional Budget Office reported Monday, a slight increase in the projection that takes into account the final tweaks that Republicans made before getting the legislation over the finish line. More than 10 million people will be uninsured under the law in 2034 because of the law, CBO found, an improvement from an earlier projection that found 11.8 million people losing coverage over the decade. The release of the CBO analysis Monday comes at the end of a grueling legislative fight, but at the start of a longer political struggle to come as the two parties clash over the law's impact on the economy, healthcare and government programs. Republicans are touting the bill as a tax cut for all Americans, yet a recent AP-NORC poll found about two-thirds of U.S. adults expect the new tax law will help the rich as Democrats attack the legislation. The bill Trump signed into law on July 4 extended current tax rates for individuals that were set to expire at the end of this year and temporarily created new tax deductions for tips, overtime and auto interest loans for new vehicles assembled in the U.S. Republicans also used the bill to cut future spending on Medicaid and food assistance, and to phase out certain clean energy tax credits more quickly. Democrats were quick to highlight the CBO's findings. “Today’s report reminds us of something: facts are stubborn and the facts are clear,” said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. ”The big, ugly betrayal is a loser for the country and will be a loser for the Republicans."" Republicans say the bill was critical to ensure most Americans didn't experience a significant tax increase next year. Trump and Republicans have also insisted that economic growth will exceed the CBO's projections for the next decade, erasing the projected deficits as more revenue comes into the Treasury than anticipated. Nonpartisan fiscal watchdogs also highlighted the CBO's latest projection. Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said there will be a shorter-term “sugar high” as stimulus makes its way through the economy. But modelers from across the ideological spectrum agree that any sustained economic changes are likely to be modestly beneficial, or negative. “And not one serious estimate claims this bill will improve our fiscal situation,” MacGuineas said. “Rather, positive growth effects are likely to be swamped by the effects of higher debt and interest rates.” The CBO said more than $1 trillion in deficit savings is generated through the health portions of the bill, which includes new work requirements for certain Medicaid beneficiaries in states that expanded the program through the Affordable Care Act. Some late changes on Medicaid were made to the bill to win over holdouts. One of those changes added a $50 billion fund for rural hospitals. __ Associated Press writer Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report."
"Parents of man who died in Colorado jail say nurses, deputies ignored his pleas for 15 hours",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/parents-of-man-who-died-in-colorado-jail-say-nurses-deputies-ignored-his-pleas-for-15-hours-2025-07-21/,"DENVER (AP) — The parents of a man who died alone in a Colorado jail cell after an ulcer burned a hole in his digestive tract and left him in what they said was excruciating pain for about 15 hours filed a federal lawsuit Monday, accusing the jail's nurses and sheriff's deputes of ignoring his cries for help. The lawsuit blames them, local government officials and Southern Health Partners for failing to stop the death of Daniel Foard in 2023 by taking him to the hospital. Foard, 32, was a cook at a brewpub and user of fentanyl who was arrested for failing to appear in court. After being segregated and monitored for withdrawal from the synthetic opioid, he began vomiting and complained of stomach pain after being put in a regular jail cell, it said. The lawsuit alleges Southern Health Partners — the Tennessee-based company they contracted with to provide health care at the La Plata County jail — has tried to maximize its profits at the jail by only having one nurse on duty at a time, leaving it to medically untrained deputies to monitor sick inmates. The company holds hundred of contracts at jails around the country and the lawsuit alleges that is has been involved in lawsuits related to the deaths of at least five other jail inmates nationally. The company's lawyer, Shira Crittendon, said she had not seen the lawsuit and declined to comment on it. The sheriff's office referred questions about the the lawsuit to a county spokesperson. In a statement, the county said it had not analyzed the allegations in the lawsuit and does not comment publicly on active litigation. Foard was found dead in the jail on Aug. 17, 2023, six days after he was arrested. An autopsy found Foard died as a result of a hole created by an ulcer in his small intestine, which caused inflammation of the tissue lining his abdomen. Such ulcers can let food and digestive juices leak out of the body's digestive tract. Fentanyl was found in Foard's blood but the autopsy report did not name that as a cause of his death. Dr. Michael Arnall ruled Foard's death was due to natural causes. On Aug. 15, 2023, even though Foard had collapsed several times and had trouble standing, he was moved out of an area where he could be more easily observed for problems with his withdrawal and put into a regular jail cell, staggering as we went, the lawsuit said. The day nurse ignored a deputy's concern that he was very unstable, according to the lawsuit brought by lawyers Dan Weiss, Anna Holland Edwards, John Holland and Erica Grossman. After a deputy delivering breakfast on Aug. 16, 2023 saw that Foard repeatedly fell while trying to get his tray, the jail's day nurse came to check on him, it said. She recorded that Foard reported he had sharp, shooting pain that was a “10” on a scale of one to 10, but she did not call for a doctor or send him to the hospital, it said. The nurse moved Foard to an empty cell where he could be monitored but didn't tell deputies what he was being monitored for and didn't order any follow up care or check on him, it said. He vomited all day and was moved to another cell and then a third because they had all become so messy with vomit, it said. Surveillance video showed him crawling to the final cell, where it said he continuously called out for help and yelled that he needed to go to a hospital, saying he was vomiting blood. The lawsuit claims that no one responded to his pleas but one deputy could be heard on surveillance video telling him to “try to hit that drain” with his vomit to keep the cell from becoming dirty. Another nurse, working the evening shift, only walked by his cell and glanced inside, but did not assess him or provide care as he was pleading for help, the lawsuit said. When she did enter his cell around 10 p.m., Foard was dead, it said. She told state investigators that vomiting was normal for people withdrawing from fentanyl. The day shift nurse later told a state investigator that it was not unusual that Foard would not have had his vital signs checked for 12 hours because of the number of inmates the jail's nurses need to provide care, according to a report from an investigation by the Colorado Bureau of Investigations. She also said she didn't think there was anything different she could have done based on Foard's symptoms. The bureau's findings were forwarded to the 6th District Attorney's Office, which would decide whether any criminal charges were warranted in connection with Foard's death. It's not known whether the office decided to pursue any charges. A telephone message and email sent to District Attorney Sean Murray were not immediately returned. In a statement, Jim Foard and Susan Gizinski said they want everyone to know about their son's ordeal both to hold those they say are responsible for his death accountable and to change how inmates are treated at the jail. “Just basic training in having compassion for others would be a great start. But adding more staff is critical too,” they said."

Federal agents in Miami arrest a prominent Haitian businessman and once presidential hopeful,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/federal-agents-in-miami-arrest-a-prominent-haitian-businessman-and-once-presidential-hopeful-2025-07-21/,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Federal agents in Miami have arrested Pierre Réginald Boulos, a well-known Haitian businessman, doctor and former presidential hopeful. The arrest occurred at Boulos' home in South Florida late last week, a person familiar with the arrest said Monday. Boulos was born in the United States but renounced his citizenship to run for president of Haiti in recent years. He obtained his U.S residency last year under the Biden administration. Boulos, who previously has denied a flurry of corruption allegations, is the most well-known Haitian arrested to date by agents with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. It wasn’t immediately clear why Boulos was arrested. ICE did not return a message seeking details. An attorney for Boulos could not be immediately reached for comment. Boulos was being held at Krome North Service Processing Center in Miami, a detention center that Human Rights Watch said in a recent report is one of three in Florida that are grossly over capacity and “flagrantly violate international human rights standards.” Boulos founded several businesses while in Haiti, where he served as president of the National Chamber of Commerce and Industry. In 2019, he created the Third Way Movement, a political party in contrast to the ""shameless elite and the unscrupulous politicians who are working to bog down the country and increase the suffering of the people,” he said at the time, according to local media. The party promptly stated it would seek ""a historic political compromise that would facilitate the negotiated departure from power of Jovenel Moïse.” Boulos visited Haiti’s central region in August 2019 as he rallied for support. “I am part of the system that must be destroyed,"" he was quoted as saying by Le Nouvelliste newspaper. “I know how to destroy it.” Moïse served as president from 2017 until he was gunned down at his private residence in July 2021. Dozens of suspects were arrested, including seventeen former Colombian soldiers who are still being interrogated by Haitian authorities. Court documents have stated that those involved in the plot included Christian Emmanuel Sanon, a pastor, doctor and failed businessman who envisioned himself as Haiti’s new leader. Elections have not been held since Moïse was killed. Gang violence surged in the political vacuum that ensued, and Boulos soon returned to the U.S. The arrest comes as the Trump administration seeks to end legal protections for hundreds of thousands of Haitians after announcing it would revoke such protections for those who arrived in the U.S. under a humanitarian parole program. Rod Joseph, a Haitian-American running for U.S. Congress, said he has been working with the administration to avoid deporting people “just for the fun of it.” “If the president goes after criminals, no one is against that,” he said over the phone on Monday. “But if you deport someone who doesn’t commit any crime who’s here seeking a better life, this is when we start having issues with the practice.”"
Domino’s Delivers Another Discounted Entry for Income Investors,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/dominos-delivers-another-discounted-entry-for-income-investors/,"Domino’s (NASDAQ DPZ) FQ2 results were weak, underperforming reduced expectations, with growth slowing and earnings in contraction, but that is not what investors should focus on. Those negative details are short-lived headlines that do not offset the increase, profits, improved business leverage, and substantial capital return. Nevertheless, a knee-jerk reaction from the market led to a fall in DPZ share prices—putting it back into attractive territory where buy-and-hold investors are likely to scoop it up. Institutional investor data tracked by MarketBeat suggests the group is likely to buy on the late-July price pullback. The group bought on balance in Q1 and Q2, as well as in the first weeks of July, netting nearly $2 in shares for every one sold, providing solid support for the market. Institutional support is significant as they own nearly 95% of the shares and are expected to continue buying. While Domino’s faces some headwinds in 2025—particularly around input costs and margin compression—it continues to grow its store count and comparable sales, boosting operating leverage. Domino's Q2 revenue was as expected at $1.15 billion, up 4.7% on a constant currency basis, with strength across all segments. Global Retail sales grew by 5.6% on a combination of store count and comp-store growth, in-store and delivery options. Store count improved by nearly 1%, U.S. comps grew by 3.4%, and International comps by 2.4% aided by market share gains. The margin is the sticking point for investors in 2025. The company improved income from operations but net contracted, resulting in a 5.5% decrease in GAAP EPS, driven by increased input costs and insurance expenses. The good news is that the earnings are sufficient to sustain the balance sheet health while investing in growth and returning capital, including dividend distribution and share buybacks. Share buybacks reduced the count by nearly 1% on a year-to-date (YTD) basis and are expected to continue as the year progresses. The dividend yields approximately 1.5%, which is slightly better than the broad market average. It is reliable and accounts for roughly 40% of the earnings forecast reported by MarketBeat. Domino’s executives didn’t provide guidance but offered a favorable outlook, citing best-in-industry unit metrics and an ability to drive long-term value for franchisees and investors. While analyst sentiment in 2025 has moderated slightly, evidenced by some price target reductions, the overall tone remains constructive. The 26 analysts tracked by MarketBeat forecast steady mid-single-digit revenue growth compounded by accelerated and accelerating earnings growth through the middle of the next decade. Earnings growth is forecasted to exceed 10%, with July stock prices valuing the business at a significant discount of only 10 times the 2035 forecast. Analysts have given DPZ stock a Moderate Buy rating and view the stock as fairly valued. A move to the low end of the trading range is possible, but new lows are unlikely without a change to the outlook, which is unexpected. The likely outcome is that DPZ price action will remain range-bound in 2025. The opportunity is to load up on shares when they are low in the range, building a position for when macroeconomic headwinds subside and tailwinds can blow. In this scenario, DPZ shares will continue to pay their dividend while the company reduces the share count and builds store count and brand leverage.

TSLA Earnings Week: Can Tesla Break Through $350?,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/tsla-earnings-week-can-tesla-break-through-350/,"Shares of Tesla Inc NASDAQ: TSLA have been rallying hard since April’s low, gaining more than 50% in that timeframe. A 3% pop last Friday added to the momentum, and the chart is showing signs of an explosive move in the near term. After a multi-month stretch of tightening consolidation, Tesla is now coiled in a bullish pennant formation that looks ready to come to a head as the automotive giant heads into arguably its most important earnings report of the year. The “test” for Tesla isn’t just what gets reported this Wednesday; it’s whether the stock can find the momentum to punch through resistance. With both the bulls and the bears drawing their battle lines, this week’s report could be the catalyst defining the rest of Tesla’s year. The good news for those of us on the sidelines is that Tesla’s chart looks bullish going into the report. Since April, there has been a clear pattern of higher lows, as the bears have been unable to check the upward progress. At the same time, there have been some lower highs, which may be to Tesla’s advantage. The narrowing range they’ve formed has created a textbook pennant formation, and as the company approaches its earnings, the pattern is nearing its apex. A bullish MACD crossover late last week supports the thesis that momentum is building on the bull’s side, and a strong earnings report could be just the ticket to send shares breaking out to the north. If that happens, the $350–$370 zone is very much in play. A move through that level would confirm the uptrend isn’t just intact, it’s gaining strength. Tesla is forecast to report a year-over-year drop in revenue and earnings, with vehicle deliveries already confirmed to be down meaningfully from last year. This is reflected in how many on Wall Street have taken a cautious stance, but it also sets the stock up nicely for an upside surprise. Tesla has missed on earnings more often than not in recent quarters, and most recent EPS revisions have been to the downside. Recent ratings lean more towards Hold or Sell, rather than Buy, which makes Tesla a dangerous stock to bet against. Don’t forget that the company delivered a massive miss on the headline numbers in April’s report, then went on to rally more than 60% almost unchecked. Additional fuel for the rally might come in the form of fresh updates from CEO Elon Musk on Tesla’s AI roadmap, including the integration of its Grok chatbot into the Optimus humanoid robot and potentially even into Tesla vehicles themselves. There’s also been the much-hyped robotaxi launch, and comments around that could easily become the main story, with investors watching for any updates about additional monetization potential or the regulatory progress. If Wednesday’s update were to add clarity to the company’s multiple ambitions, it should be enough to kick off the next leg of the rally. It’s worth noting, though, that Tesla’s P/E ratio sits near 180, frothy by any definition, especially with profit and revenue expected to decline year over year. However, the bulls will argue that Tesla is no longer just an EV company but an AI and energy infrastructure play with massive potential. To sustain that narrative, though, Tesla must prove it can deliver meaningful innovation and execution, especially in a tougher macro and competitive environment. For now, though, the bulls have the momentum, and the chart looks healthy. Last week’s bullish crossover of the MACD might well have been the best signal yet that the tightening pennant will be broken by the stock breaking out to the north. Before you consider Tesla, you'll want to hear this."

"Goldman, Morgan Stanley, & BofA: Diverging Paths After Earnings",https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/goldman-morgan-stanley-and-bofa-diverging-paths-after-earnings/,"Wall Street just wrapped up a big week for earnings in the financial sector, and if there's one clear thing, it's that not all banks are built the same right now. With rising interest rates no longer the tailwind they once were, and margin pressure becoming a theme, investors are quickly drawing lines between the winners and the also-rans. While all three major bank stocks profiled below have rallied strongly since April, their post-earnings setups diverge rapidly. Let's see which ones are worth chasing and which might be best avoided. Of the three, Goldman Sachs Group Inc NYSE: GS is the best performer since April, up more than 60% and now consolidating just below all-time highs. On paper, there's a lot to like. The company has just delivered a solid set of Q2 earnings, beating analyst expectations and showing revenue growth of 15% year-over-year. Valuation-wise, it's also solid with a P/E ratio of around 15, not too hot and not too cold. But there's a sense that much of the good news is already priced in. Despite the headline beat, the stock's reaction was muted. Several analysts called it a Hold in the aftermath of Wednesday's report, with Market Perform and Equal Weight ratings dominating the commentary. While shares are still below many of the refreshed price targets, the lack of urgency suggests the near-term upside might be limited unless Goldman can show another gear. There's no question this has been the hottest bank stock of the past few months, but it's also starting to feel like a lot of the easy gains have already been made. Shares of Morgan Stanley NYSE: MS haven't rallied quite as much as Goldman's, but its post-earnings setup looks more interesting. Interestingly, though, shares did drop sharply after Wednesday's earnings release, falling as much as 4% before recovering and finishing Thursday in the green. However, the fact that the dip was so quickly bought up points to a strong undercurrent of demand for the stock right now. Heading into the year's second half, there's a lot to like about Morgan Stanley. Fundamentally, the company exceeded earnings expectations this week, with revenue up nearly 12% year-over-year. Management has also been stepping up with shareholder-friendly moves, including a dividend increase and a larger buyback program. The analyst reaction has also been more encouraging than Goldman's, with Keefe Bruyette & Woods upgrading the stock to Outperform earlier this month. The stock's chart is solid, the fundamentals are improving, and the Street is starting to warm up. If you're looking for the name with the most near-term upside potential, this is probably it. Bank of America Corp. NYSE: BAC has also had a decent run over the past few months, rallying more than 40% since April. However, unlike its peers, it's still trading below its 2022 all-time high, which says a lot. Furthermore, the bank missed revenue expectations in its Q2 report this week, likely weighing on sentiment for the foreseeable future. Investors have had reason to be skeptical, and for now, at least, their skepticism appears justified. While the broader financial sector has been enjoying a bright spell, Bank of America continues to lag its peers on both technicals and fundamentals. There's no real breakout narrative here, and the market seems to know it. To its credit, Bank of America is the cheapest of the three, trading at a P/E ratio of about 13. If you're a deep-value investor willing to stomach more risk, a long-term case must be made. However, in the near term, there are simply better options.

Build Stability and Income With 3 Overlooked Dividend Leaders,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/build-stability-and-income-with-3-overlooked-dividend-leaders/,"Dividend investing is one of the most popular strategies among retail investors seeking a combination of stability and passive income. A long-term buy-and-hold approach for stalwart dividend players like The Coca-Cola Co. NYSE: KO or Johnson & Johnson NYSE: JNJ rewards patience and a commitment to reinvesting payouts over time. Many investors seek dividend yields in the 2-3% range and dividend payout ratios below about 80%, taking these as indicators of a company's ability to continue paying dividends sustainably for an extended period of time. It's also possible to seek a slightly more aggressive approach to dividend income in companies with higher yields and payout ratios. Of course, higher yields do not necessarily guarantee a sustainable long-term dividend income, and investors should also monitor payout ratios to ensure that any dividend targets retain enough income to maintain and grow their business. Investors might find that the companies below strike an attractive balance of operational stability and high dividend yields. Enterprise Products Partners L.P. NYSE: EPD is a midstream energy services firm with infrastructure that includes roughly 50,000 miles of pipeline. Enterprise has yet to fully recover after a share price dip in early April, alongside the Trump administration's tariff announcements. This makes for a unique buy opportunity on what many investors consider a hold-forever name. Enterprise has about three decades of dividend distribution history to support its position as a prime dividend leader. Although the firm's payout ratio is somewhat high at 80.2%, this solid record of dividend payouts and increases should allay investor concerns. What's more, the company's high dividend yield of 6.82% is only likely to look more attractive when the Fed lowers interest rates. In addition to these factors, analysts see room for capital appreciation. Enterprise is expected to post earnings growth above 5% in the coming year, and nine out of 14 analysts rate EPD shares a Buy. At a consensus price target above $36 per share, Enterprise stock could rise by 15% or more alongside earnings improvement. Like EPD above, shares of logistics and delivery giant United Parcel Service NYSE: UPS have been down in recent months. The stock fell in February and again in April 2025 and remains nearly 20% below its start to the year. However, with improvements to operational efficiency and profit in the first quarter of the year, the company's strategy of pursuing higher-quality deliveries over all-out volume seems to be paying off. Critically for the passive income seeker, UPS has a 16-year history of dividend increases and a high yield of 6.55%. The company's dividend payout ratio of 95.6% is elevated and may scare off some investors. However, those willing to take a risk, or those optimistic about the company's likelihood of continuing to grow its earnings, may be rewarded with substantial dividend payouts. Fortunately, analysts believe that UPS will experience earnings growth (10.3%) in the coming quarters. The company also has upside potential of just under 20%, suggesting that capital growth may also be a factor to consider. ONEOK Inc. NYSE: OKE is also a midstream energy services company. However, while Enterprise's share price has risen somewhat since plunging in early April, ONEOK's stock plateaued during the same period and is thus down more than 21% YTD. However, the company may be able to improve its position thanks to new construction that should expand its infrastructure. OKE shares may appeal to dividend investors because of their 5.1% dividend yield. The company's payout ratio of 80.5% is roughly equivalent to Enterprise's above. Still, the firm has a long history of stability in its dividend disbursements, thanks to its similarly stable cash flow. Analysts are broadly optimistic about ONEOK and predict that the company's earnings could rise by more than 17% in the coming quarters. A price target of over $103 per share would imply nearly 29% in upside potential, despite the fact that only just over half of the 16 analysts rating OKE shares have assigned it a Buy. Like both companies above, ONEOK combines a compelling dividend yield with a potentially high payout ratio and the potential for share price appreciation.

Iran sends a rocket designed to carry satellites into a suborbital test flight,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/iran-sends-a-rocket-designed-to-carry-satellites-into-a-suborbital-test-flight-2025-07-21/,"TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iran tested one of its satellite carrying rockets with a suborbital flight on Monday, state media reported, the first such test since a ceasefire was reached after a 12-day war waged by Israel against Iran in June, which also saw the United States strike nuclear-related facilities in the Islamic Republic. The test was the latest for a program that the West says improves Tehran’s ballistic missiles. A report by the official IRNA news agency said the Ghased satellite carrier test aimed at “assessing some emerging new technologies in the country’s space industry.” It said the test results will help improve the function of Iran's satellites and space systems. The report did not provide any further details on the test flight or from where the rocket was launched. Iran from time to time Iran launches satellite carriers to send its satellites to the space. Last September, Iran launched a satellite into space with a rocket built by the country’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard. The Ghased, a solid and fluid fuel rocket, was first inaugurated in 2020 by the Guard when it put a military satellite in the orbit. The war in June killed nearly 1,100 Iranians, including senior military commanders and nuclear scientist. Retaliatory missile barrages by Iran killed 28 in Israel."
Subway hires former Burger King executive as its new CEO,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/subway-hires-former-burger-king-executive-as-its-new-ceo-2025-07-21/,"Subway has hired a former Burger King executive as its new CEO. The Miami-based sandwich chain said Monday that Jonathan Fitzpatrick will join the company on July 28. Fitzpatrick is the first CEO hired since Subway was bought by the private equity firm Roark Capital in 2024. And Roark didn’t have to look far to find him. Since 2012, Fitzpatrick has been the president and CEO of Driven Brands, which is also owned by Roark. Driven Brands is the parent company of auto service brands like Meineke Car Care Centers and Maaco. Before joining Driven Brands, Fitzpatrick held multiple senior leadership positions at Burger King, including executive vice president. Subway was founded in 1965 and was still owned by its founding families when it was purchased by Roark. It’s one of the world’s largest restaurant chains, with nearly 37,000 outlets in more than 100 countries. But in recent years, Subway has been losing sales to fast-growing rivals like Jersey Mike’s and Firehouse Subs. The company tried to catch up. In 2022, it announced a line of chef-developed sandwiches after finding that customers were tiring of Subway’s traditional model of letting customers build their own subs. When Roark bought Subway, it said it planned to continue to modernize restaurants and expand internationally. It left in place Subway’s CEO John Chidsey, who was the first nonfamily member to lead Subway when he joined the company in 2019. But Chidsey retired late last year. Roark, which is known for its expertise in restaurant management, backs two holding companies that own multiple restaurant chains: Inspire Brands, the parent of Arby’s, Dunkin’, Jimmy John’s, Sonic and Buffalo Wild Wings; and GoTo Foods, which owns Auntie Anne’s, Carvel, Cinnabon and Jamba. In June, Roark bought Dave’s Hot Chicken in a deal valued at $1 billion. Before you consider Buffalo Wild Wings, you'll want to hear this."
Mayor denies wrongdoing in a corruption probe into Milan's building boom,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/mayor-denies-wrongdoing-in-a-corruption-probe-into-milans-building-boom-2025-07-21/,"MILAN (AP) — Milan Mayor Giuseppe Sala on Monday said he would not step down in the face of a sweeping probe into the city’s massive urban development over the last two decades, saying, “My hands are clean.” The city’s top urban development official, however, resigned while denying wrongdoing. Milan prosecutors last week announced a widespread investigation into the real estate boom that has seen skyscrapers transform the city’s skyline and entire neighborhoods rebuilt, including the construction of an Olympic village for the 2026 Milan-Cortina Winter Games. The investigation targets more than 70 people, including Sala, as prosecutors allege corruption that made Italy’s financial and fashion capital “a commodity to be plundered.’’ The probe alleges that developers bribed officials to speed building permits and win approval for projects. Prosecutors are seeking the arrest of six people, including Giancarlo Tancredi, an architect who has been the city’s top urban development official since 2021. Tancredi announced his resignation to focus on his defense but denied any wrongdoing. “My conscience is clear,’’ he said. Sala, a member of the center-left Democratic Party who is serving his second term as mayor, denied any wrongdoing during an address to the city council, saying, “All I have done is in the interest of the city.’’ Sala pledged to continue in his mandate, which expires at the end of 2026, and underlined the necessity of continuing projects that are in the works, including determining the future of Milan’s San Siro stadium, home to soccer clubs AC Milan and Inter Milan. The teams want the city to jointly buy the stadium so they can tear it down and build a new one. The investigation has led to calls by the center-right majority that governs from Rome for Sala to step down. But he has received the support of Lombardy's regional governor, Attilio Fontana, a prominent center-right politician, while Premier Giorgia Meloni urged caution, saying an investigation should not automatically lead to resignation. Milan’s extraordinary development around the 2015 Expo and now the Olympics has sent real estate prices skyrocketing. Many say ordinary workers have been priced out in gentrification. “Do we need to do more to make Milan more fair, healthy and balanced? By definition, we must always do more,’’ Sala said."
What to know about the CEO caught embracing an employee on the jumbotron at a Coldplay concert,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/what-to-know-about-the-ceo-caught-embracing-an-employee-on-the-jumbtron-at-a-coldplay-concert-2025-07-21/,"LONDON (AP) — A routine moment of crowdwork at a Coldplay concert went viral last week when a couple tried to avoid the spotlight after they were caught hugging on the jumbotron. Internet sleuths quickly figured out that they were the CEO and chief people officer of a little-known tech company called Astronomer. The snippet of video set the internet alight, fueling a wave of memes and drawing attention to the erosion of privacy in public spaces. Here are some things to know: During the concert on Wednesday at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, lead singer Chris Martin asked the cameras to scan the crowd for his “Jumbotron Song,” when he sings a few lines about the people the camera lands on. A man wearing a birthday sash was up first. Two people in banana costumes were highlighted. But in between, something unexpected happened. For several seconds, a couple was shown on the big screen. They were cuddling and smiling, his arms wrapped around her, as she leaned back into him. When they saw themselves on the big screen, her jaw dropped, her hands flew to her face and she spun away from the camera. He ducked out of the frame, as did she. “Either they’re having an affair or they’re just very shy,” Martin joked. It didn’t end there. After the video went viral, the internet got to work. Online sleuths rapidly figured out that the man was Andy Byron, chief executive officer, while she was Kristin Cabot, the chief people officer — in other words, the head of human resources. Astronomer, based in New York, provides big companies with a platform that helps them organize their data. The company at first said little about the incident. In response to an initial inquiry from The Associated Press, Astronomer's spokesman said only that a statement attributed to Byron that circulated online immediately after the incident was a “fake from a clearly labeled parody account.” The company later confirmed the identities of the couple in a statement to AP. In the hours after the video went viral, Byron's name was at one point the most searched term on Google. Astronomer eventually addressed the situation, announcing in a LinkedIn post late Friday that Byron had been placed on leave and that the board of directors had launched a formal investigation. The company said a day later that Byron had resigned, and that its cofounder and chief product officer, Pete DeJoy, was tapped as interim CEO while it searches for Byron’s successor. “Astronomer is committed to the values and culture that have guided us since our founding. Our leaders are expected to set the standard in both conduct and accountability, and recently, that standard was not met,” the company said in its post on LinkedIn. DeJoy weighed in on Monday how the company was thrust into the spotlight. “The events of the past few days have received a level of media attention that few companies—let alone startups in our small corner of the data and AI world — ever encounter,” he wrote on Linkedin. ""The spotlight has been unusual and surreal for our team and, while I would never have wished for it to happen like this, Astronomer is now a household name. It’s easy to miss, but most concert venues have signs informing the audience that they could be filmed during the event. Look for them on the walls when you arrive and around the bar areas or toilets. It’s common practice especially when bands like to use performances for music videos or concert films. The venue in this case, Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, also has a privacy policy online which states: “When you visit our location or attend or participate in an event at our location, we may capture your image, voice and/or likeness, including through the use of CCTV cameras and/or when we film or photograph you in a public location.” In the internet age, such videos — or ones taken on someone's smartphone — can quickly zip around the world. This video rocketed around social media, as people speculated about why the couple dodged the camera. Empathy for the pair and their families was mixed with plenty of snarky commentary and countless memes, with the fake statement from the chief executive generating a lot of additional vitriol. And news reports said that Byron's LinkedIn account was disabled after it was flooded by a wave of comments. “It’s a little bit unsettling how easily we can be identified with biometrics, how our faces are online, how social media can track us — and how the internet has gone from being a place of interaction, to a gigantic surveillance system,"" said Mary Angela Bock, an associate professor in the University of Texas at Austin’s School of Journalism and Media. ""We are being surveilled by our social media. They’re tracking us in exchange for entertaining us.” _____ AP Business Writer Wyatte Grantham-Philips contributed to this report from New York."
Kinder Morgan: At the Hotspot of the Natural Gas Revolution,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/kinder-morgan-at-the-hotspot-of-the-natural-gas-revolution/,"Kinder Morgan NYSE: KMI is poised to grow robustly over the coming years, at a steady and reliable pace that income investors can appreciate. Growth will be driven by the combination of its expanding natural gas pipeline network and capacity, compounded by increasing demand for these resources. Demand growth, forecast by KMI at 20% through the decade’s end, is tied to decarbonization and the rapid expansion of natural gas infrastructure, including numerous projects coming online globally this year and next. “With historic growing natural gas demand forecasts, a positive federal regulatory environment, and highly supportive federal permitting agencies, the future for our company is very bright,” said Executive Chairman Richard D. Kinder. The steady and reliable growth pace fuels a steadily improving cash flow, ample profits, and the ability to self-fund expansion while paying its substantial dividend and maintaining a healthy balance sheet. The dividend is a critical factor for this investment, as it pays more than 4.2% as of mid-July, and the distribution is expected to increase over time. Kinder Morgan’s dividend payment is safe and reliable, despite its eye-popping, nearly 100% payout ratio. While a red flag, this company’s business model includes long-term contracts that provide clear revenue and earnings visibility, allowing it to pay dividends from its distributable cash flow, which is superior and sufficient, providing a payout ratio of 65% in FQ2 2025. At the quarter’s end, balance sheet highlights include mildly increased liability offset by steady cash, increased total assets, and rising equity. Leverage also remains low, with long-term debt running at approximately one times the equity, and credit costs declining due to recent improvements in credit ratings. Two of the major rating agencies lifted their outlook to positive, indicating potential for an upgrade, while the other affirmed its BBB rating and stable outlook. Kinder Morgan had a solid Q2 with revenue of $4.04 billion, growing by 13.2% and outpacing MarketBeat’s reported consensus. The outperformance is substantial, topping the consensus forecast by 550 basis points, driven by strength in the natural gas and LNG export segments. Margin news is also favorable, with natural gas margins realigning with long-term trends as projects come online. The only bad news is that analysts had expected a little more; the $0.28 in adjusted earnings is as expected despite the top-line strength. The guidance serves as a catalyst for a long-term increase in share price. It was improved, with management expecting to exceed its forecast by at least the contribution of its recent acquisition. That forecast puts full-year net income growth well above the 8% originally forecasted and is supported by the growing backlog. The company’s project backlog increased to $9.3 billion, a 6% net increase, with new projects outpacing those put into service by nearly 2-to-1 on a dollar basis. The analysts' trends for KMI stock in the early second half of 2023 are positive and provide a lift for the market. Not only is the coverage increasing, but positive price target revisions support the firm's Moderate Buy rating. The consensus in mid-July is for a 10% upside while the trend leads to the high-end range, which tops out at $38. The $38 target represents a 38% upside in addition to the 4.2% dividend yield. The institutional group similarly supports KMI stock. They own more than 60% of the shares, their activity ramped to a multi-year high in 2025, and they are buying on balance, netting nearly $2 in shares for every $1 sold through mid-July. Before you consider Kinder Morgan, you'll want to hear this."
"5 years after Ohio's $60M bribery scandal, critics say more could be done to prevent a repeat",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/5-years-after-ohios-60m-bribery-scandal-critics-say-more-could-be-done-to-prevent-a-repeat-2025-07-21/,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Five years after a $60 million bribery scheme funded by FirstEnergy Corp. came to light in Ohio, expert observers say the resulting prosecutions, lawsuits, penalties and legislation haven't led to enough change and accountability to prevent politicians and corporate executives from cutting similar deals in the future. The scheme — whose prospective $2 billion-plus pricetag to consumers makes it the largest infrastructure scandal in U.S. history — surfaced with the stunning arrests of a powerful Republican state lawmaker and four associates on July 21, 2020. That lawmaker, former House Speaker Larry Householder, is serving 20 years in federal prison for masterminding the racketeering operation at the center of the scandal. Jurors agreed with prosecutors that money that changed hands wasn’t everyday political giving, but an elaborate secret scheme orchestrated by Householder to elect political allies, become the House speaker, pass a $1 billion nuclear bailout law in House Bill 6 and crush a repeal effort. One of the dark money groups Householder used also pleaded guilty to racketeering. Householder and a former lobbyist have unsuccessfully challenged their convictions. Two of the arrested associates pleaded guilty, and the other died by suicide. Any hope that the convictions would have clarified federal law around 501(c)4 nonprofit “dark money” groups or prompted new restrictions on those hasn’t materialized, said former U.S. Attorney David DeVillers, who led the initial investigation. “I think it’s actually worse than it was before,” he said. “Nationally, you have both Democrats and Republicans using these, so there’s no political will to do anything about it.” Indeed, a study released in May by the Brennan Center for Justice found that dark money unleashed by the 2010 Citizens United decision hit a record high of $1.9 billion in 2024 federal races, nearly double the $1 billion spent in 2020. The vast majority of money from undisclosed donors raised into dark money accounts now goes to super PACs, providing them a way to skirt a requirement that they make their donors public, the study found. DeVillers said one positive result of the scandal is that Ohio lawmakers appear genuinely concerned about avoiding quid pro quos, real or perceived, between them and their political contributors. Anti-corruption legislation perennially introduced by Ohio Democrats since the scandal broke has gone nowhere in the GOP-dominated Legislature. Republican legislative leaders have said it is outside their authority to amend federal campaign finance law. The U.S. Attorney’s office declined to discuss the investigation because prosecutions remain ongoing. Two fired FirstEnergy executives have pleaded not guilty on related state and federal charges and await trial. Former Public Utilities Commission of Ohio Chairman Samuel Randazzo, to whom FirstEnergy admitted giving a $4.3 million bribe in exchange for regulatory favors, had faced both federal and state charges. He died by suicide after pleading not guilty. Akron-based FirstEnergy — a $23 billion Fortune 500 company with 6 million customers in five states — admitted using dark money groups to bankroll Householder’s ascendance in exchange for passage of the bailout bill. It agreed to pay $230 million and meet other conditions to avoid prosecution, and faced other sanctions, including a $100 million civil penalty by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. But FirstEnergy hasn't yet faced consequences from the state regulator. “They never actually got penalized by regulators at the PUCO level,” said Ohio Consumers’ Counsel Maureen Willis, the lawyer for Ohio utility customers. Testimony in four PUCO proceedings stemming from the scandal finally began last month after the cases were delayed for nearly two years, in part at the request of the Justice Department. They’re intended to determine whether FirstEnergy used money for bribes that was meant for grid modernization and whether it improperly comingled money from its different corporate entities. FirstEnergy spokeperson Jennifer Young said it invested $4 billion in grid upgrades in 2024 and plans to spend a total of $28 billion through 2029. Young said FirstEnergy has redesigned its organizational structure, established a dedicated ethics and compliance office, overhauled the company’s political activity and lobbying practices and strengthened other corporate governance and oversight practices. “FirstEnergy is a far different company today than it was five years ago,” she said. The PUCO also made changes in response to the scandal. Chair Jenifer French told state lawmakers that ethics training has been enhanced, staff lawyers and the administrative law judges who hear cases now report to different directors to ensure legal independence, and she never takes a meeting alone. Ashley Brown, a retired executive director of the Harvard Electricity Policy Group who previously served as a PUCO commissioner, said the commission is the only state entity with the power to order FirstEnergy to return tainted cash — including the bribe money — to customers. That largely hasn’t happened. He said the Ohio commission had vast power to hold FirstEnergy accountable for its misdeeds but hasn't conducted its own management audit of the energy giant, demanded an overhaul of FirstEnergy’s corporate board or pressed for public release of FirstEnergy’s own internal investigation of the scandal, whose findings remain a mystery. Shareholders won some accountability measures as part of a $180 million settlement in 2022, but they continue to fight in court for release of the investigation. Willis does, too. “How do you allow a utility to operate a vast criminal conspiracy within the utility (with) consumer dollars, and you don’t even look at what went wrong?” Brown said. PUCO spokesperson Matt Schilling reiterated that the commission's probes are ongoing. He said the panel has vowed to take its proceedings “wherever the facts lead.” The portion of HB 6 that bailed out two FirstEnergy-affiliated nuclear plants was repealed in 2021, and $26 million was refunded to customers. The scandal investigation revealed that other power distribution companies got a lucrative payout of their own added to the bill in exchange for their buy-in: subsidies for two unprofitable Cold War-era coal plants. It wasn’t until April that a law was passed repealing those subsidies. Until that takes effect Aug. 14, the charges cost Ohio ratepayers $445,679 a day — and it’s unclear if or when they’ll get that money back. A ticker on Willis’ website puts the total they’ve paid at more than $500 million and counting."
How Robinhood Stock Benefits From New Pro Gambling Tax Changes,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/how-robinhood-stock-benefits-from-new-pro-gambling-tax-changes/,"A tiny passage in President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) Act can potentially massively disrupt the professional sports betting industry in the U.S. Under the new law, professional gamblers won’t get the same lenient tax treatment as stock and options traders, as only 90% of betting losses will be tax-deductible against income, as opposed to the complete 100% under the previous rule. While a 10% tweak may seem minor, it will drastically change the U.S. betting landscape as pros seek ways to minimize their tax burden. One unlikely winner of this whole situation? Robinhood Markets Inc. NASDAQ: HOOD is already soaring to new all-time highs. The life of a professional gambler is far less glamorous than amateur bettors assume. You aren’t sitting in stadium club boxes getting showered in cash and high-fiving celebrities; you’re hunched over your phone at a sports book, poring over the dozens (if not hundreds) of bets you’ve made that week. Professional gamblers are more like day traders, seeking out small gains after small gains, avoiding losses, and hoping to win slightly more than they lose. A win rate of 50% isn’t enough to break even either. To beat the sports book’s house cut, which is often called the vig or juice, you need to win 52.4% of the time. Now, imagine you’re a newbie pro gambler calculating your year-end earnings. Your bankroll for the year was $5 million, and you placed $5,000 wagers on 1000 different bets. If you lose 470 of your 1000 bets, you’ve lost $2.35 million while earning $2.65 million from your 530 winning bets. You’re up $300,000 on the year since your losses cancel out your winnings. Or at least they used to. Thanks to new legislation in the OBBB Act, you can only deduct 90% of your gambling losses on your taxes. So in this scenario, you’d only be able to deduct $2,115,000 of your $2,350,000 in losses. Your net profits are $300,000, but your taxable income is $485,000 (and this hypothetical doesn’t even factor in the betting vig!) An income of $485,000 for a single filer has a 35% federal tax rate in 2025, so your obligation to the IRS would be $169,750 - a nearly $65,000 increase on your tax bill from the previous regulation. While this change will have little effect on weekend warriors betting NFL parlays on DraftKings Inc. NASDAQ: DKNG, professionals will likely seek new jurisdictions or alternative ways to bet on sports. Enter event contracts. Prediction markets have become popular features in the finance sector, especially among crypto adopters. Polymarket and Kalshi are two of the largest platforms operating in the U.S., where gamblers can bet on everything from sports to elections to stock prices to the high temperature in New York City on a given Tuesday. Yes, it gets degenerate fast. Robinhood has also started offering prediction markets through a partnership with Kalshi, with events ranging from Fed funds rates, unemployment rates, gas prices, and (of course) sports. Unlike traditional sports betting, event contract trading is regulated under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which considers them to be Swaps, or notional principal contracts. This distinction is crucial; Swaps are taxed as ordinary income, meaning if your winning swaps earn $200,000 and your losing swaps lose $100,000, you can deduct the full $100,000 in losses against your gains. Regulation under the CFTC also allows Robinhood to bypass state gambling commissions, which have historically shown hostility toward these types of contracts. Prediction markets through Robinhood offer professional sports bettors a new avenue to wager on NFL, NBA, and other pro leagues without the onerous tax obligations. Naturally, Robinhood takes a small commission on each transaction, and event contracts aren’t a ‘gambler vs. the house’ proposition; your counterparty is another trader taking the opposite side of the action. Counterparty risk and liquidity risk aren’t worries for gamblers at a casino, but must be considered when trading on these new and lightly-regulated prediction markets. However, the growth is undeniable as Robinhood reported more than one billion event contracts traded in the first six months of availability, helping fuel the company’s 50% year-over-year (YOY) quarterly revenue growth. The $927 million figure was the second-highest in Robinhood’s history, and analysts have been scrambling to update their price targets to reflect more bullishness. Piper Sandler, Morgan Stanley, and JMP Securities all bumped their price projections this week to $110, $110, and $125, respectively. The stock continues to provide reasons to buy, and analysts and investors alike will be watching intently when the company releases its Q2 2025 earnings on July 30.

Over 5.2 million pools sold across the U.S. and Canada are under recall after reports of nine deaths,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/over-52-million-pools-sold-across-the-us-and-canada-are-under-recall-after-reports-of-nine-deaths-2025-07-21/,"NEW YORK (AP) — More than 5.2 million aboveground swimming pools sold across the U.S. and Canada over the last two decades are being recalled after nine drowning deaths were reported. The recall covers a range of Bestway, Intex Recreation and Polygroup pools that were sold by major retailers as far back as 2002. According to Monday notices published by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and Health Canada, these pools have compression straps running along the outside of the product — which “may create a foothold” for small children and allow them to access the water unattended. That can pose a serious drowning risk, the safety regulatory warn. To date, the CPSC believes nine children across the U.S. have drowned after gaining access to these now-recalled pools in this way. Those deaths occurred between 2007 and 2022, involving children between the ages of 22 months and 3 years old. No additional fatalities have been reported in Canada. Consumers in possession of these pools are urged to immediately contact Bestway, Intex and/or Polygroup to receive a free repair kit — which will consist of a rope to replace the compression strap. Owners of these pools should otherwise ensure that small children cannot access the pool without supervision, regulators note — and could alternatively drain the pool until the repair is made. All of the pools being recalled are 48 inches or taller — and can be identified by brand and model names listed on both the CPSC and Health Canada's recall notices. Sales of the pools ranged by model and location, but date as far back to 2002 and as recently as 2025. About 5 million of these now-recalled pools were sold across the U.S. — including both online and in-stores at major retailers like Walmart, Target, Lowe's, Costco and Amazon. Another 266,000 were sold in Canada."
3 Bullish Biotech Stocks With Explosive Growth Trends,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/3-bullish-biotech-stocks-with-explosive-growth-trends/,"Investing in biotechnology stocks is similar to the drug development process itself. That is, investors frequently experience long periods of nothing much happening, interrupted by periods of sharp movement. This is particularly true of small-cap biotech stocks. In many cases, these are unprofitable companies with little to no revenue. However, these are also the companies that can provide the highest return for risk-tolerant investors. The risk with these stocks is that the company can deliver poor clinical trial results. In some cases, promising medicine never gets through the rigorous Food & Drug Administration (FDA) process. Even if they do, there’s always the risk of competitors getting to market faster. MarketBeat has made it easier for investors to manage the risk in biotech stocks with its new FDA Events tool that allows investors to stay on top of critical catalysts for these stocks. That information, combined with bullish analyst sentiment, can point you to stocks that may be ready for a breakout. Here are three small-cap biotech stocks to consider. UroGen Pharma Ltd. NASDAQ: URGN is a small-cap biotech company focused on treating urologic cancers and diseases. The company’s flagship drugs, Jelymyto and Zusduri, feature UroGen’s proprietary RTGel technology. This allows the drugs to stay in the urinary tract longer, which can improve their efficacy. UroGen stock is up approximately 43% in 2025 as the company has applied to expand the Jelymyto label to include low-grade bladder cancer. This would significantly expand the drug’s addressable market to include the 6th most common cancer in the United States. Phase 3 trial results are due in the second half of 2025. The UroGen analyst forecasts on MarketBeat give URGN stock a $32.86 price target, a gain of over 115% from its closing price on July 18. Investors should note that much of the stock’s aggressive price movement in the last three months is likely due to short covering. Over 42% of the URGN stock float is sold short, which could keep gains in check until a new catalyst exists. Nektar Therapeutics NASDAQ: NKTR is an example of why investing in biotech stocks carries significant risk. Even after a 78% gain in 2025, NKRT stock is still down over 93% in the last five years. The stock slide is largely due to several high-profile clinical trial failures. However, investors are bullish about the company’s latest candidate for treating systemic lupus erythematosus and ulcerative colitis, among other conditions. The company delivered positive Phase 2b clinical trial results, which also resulted in a Fast Track designation from the FDA. The Nektar Therapeutics analyst forecasts on MarketBeat have an $88.33 consensus price target on the stock, a 254% increase from its closing price on July 18. However, a pullback is likely with NKTR stock up over 100% in the last 30 days. Short interest is around 10% and has jumped over 104%. On the other hand, after a series of asset sales and cost reductions, the company has extended its runway to get its drugs through the clinical trial process. Gene editing is one of the most tantalizing fields of study in the biotech sector. Verve Therapeutics NASDAQ: VERV is at the forefront of using gene editing to treat cardiovascular disease. Verve is still a clinical-stage company, so its product revenue is primarily from partnerships and equity offerings. However, the company was approved for a Phase 1b U.S. clinical trial for its lead candidate, VERVE-102, in early 2025. This is a CRISPR-based editing therapy designed for one-time use. The drug targets the PCSK9 gene that drives high cholesterol and atherosclerosis. Unlike the other two stocks on this list, VERV stock has the lowest ceiling. Analysts have a consensus price target of $14.57 on the stock. That's still a 33% upside, but that’s significantly lower than the potential in the other two stocks. Analysts are likely considering the long-term nature of clinical trials. However, it’s worth noting that short interest has dropped over 30%, which is typically a sign that bearish sentiment is waning. Before you consider Verve Therapeutics, you'll want to hear this."
Ford Foundation's outgoing president joins the board of Obama Foundation,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/ford-foundations-outgoing-president-joins-the-board-of-obama-foundation-2025-07-21/,"Darren Walker’s post-Ford Foundation future is starting to take shape, as the outgoing president is now set to join The Obama Foundation’s board of directors. The Obama Foundation, the Chicago-based nonprofit of former President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama focused on encouraging active involvement in democracy through initiatives like the My Brother’s Keeper Alliance and the Obama Youth Jobs Corps, announced Monday that Walker would join the board on Nov. 1. “Darren Walker is an outstanding example of what it means to lead with purpose in philanthropy,” President Obama said in a statement. “Darren’s work to challenge long-held assumptions, stand up to injustice, and build unlikely partnerships aligns perfectly with the mission of the Obama Foundation. His experience and insight will sharpen our thinking and deepen our impact as we help the next generation of leaders change their world for the better.” Walker, 65, who has led the Ford Foundation since 2013 and oversaw major investments in gender equity and disability rights, is one of philanthropy’s best-known leaders. He has been one of Rolling Stone’s “25 People Shaping the Future” and Time’s “100 Most Influential People.” “Joining The Obama Foundation Board feels like coming home to everything I believe about leadership and change,” Walker said in a statement. “I believe deeply in the power of individuals to change the world, and I’m honored to work with President and Mrs. Obama to help empower and support the next generation of changemakers.” In addition to his new role at the Obama Foundation, Walker has already been named president of the National Gallery of Art. In September, “The Idea of America: Reflections on Inequality, Democracy, and the Values We Share,” a collection of his essays, will be published. The Ford Foundation has selected Yale Law School Dean Heather Gerken, a leading expert on constitutional law and democracy, to succeed Darren Walker as its president. Marty Nesbitt, chairman of the Obama Foundation’s board of directors, said Walker will help the nonprofit stick to its mission. “Darren brings a rare combination of visionary thinking and practical know-how that will strengthen our governance and sharpen our impact,” he said. “His deep experience leading through complexity and bringing diverse voices to the table will be an invaluable asset as we guide the foundation into its next chapter and open the Obama Presidential Center next year.” _____ Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

FDA names former pharmaceutical company executive to oversee US drug program,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/fda-names-former-pharmaceutical-company-executive-to-oversee-us-drug-program-2025-07-21/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Food and Drug Administration on Monday named a longtime pharmaceutical executive to run the agency’s drug program, the latest in a string of leadership changes at the agency. FDA Commissioner Marty Makary announced that Dr. George Tidmarsh, a cancer and pediatric specialist, will direct the agency’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, which regulates the safety and effectiveness of all U.S. drugs. His appointment comes a month after the center’s acting director, Dr. Jacqueline Corrigan-Curay, announced her retirement. As the agency's top drug regulator, Tidmarsh will be charged with following through on a number of commitments made by Makary and his boss, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., including reviewing the safety of the abortion pill mifepristone. The FDA is also scrutinizing certain uses of other long-established drugs, including antidepressants and hormone-replacement drugs for menopause. Tidmarsh founded and led several pharmaceutical companies, including Horizon Pharmaceuticals, maker of an anti-inflammatory medication for arthritis. He has also served as an adjunct professor at Stanford University. The FDA's drug center is the agency's largest unit, with nearly 6,000 staffers responsible for reviewing the safety and effectiveness of new drugs and monitoring the use and marketing of older drugs. About 2,000 FDA staffers have been laid off as part of widescale cuts to the federal health workforce overseen by Kennedy. More than 1,000 others have taken buyouts or early retirement, while many others are reportedly searching for new jobs. The departures have threatened basic FDA operations, including the timely review of new drugs. FDA's drug center hasn’t had a permanent director since January, when Dr. Patrizia Cavazzoni stepped down days before President Donald Trump took office. Nearly all of the FDA’s senior leadership positions have turned over in recent months, either due to retirements, resignations or actions by administration officials placing them on administrative leave. FDA center directors typically hold their positions for years or even decades, serving across multiple administrations, whether Republican or Democrat. In May, Makary named Dr. Vinay Prasad, a prominent critic of the FDA’s COVID response, to run the agency’s vaccine center. He was also named to the post of FDA chief medical officer. Prasad joined the agency after his predecessor, longtime vaccine chief Dr. Peter Marks, was forced out in March. The head of FDA’s tobacco center was also forced to step down in April. A permanent replacement has not yet been named. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
