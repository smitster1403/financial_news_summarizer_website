"IT stocks rally for 2nd day: OFSS, Wipro, others rise up to 8% on hopes over US trade talks, Fed rate cut",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/it-stocks-rally-for-2nd-day-ofss-wipro-others-rise-up-to-8-on-hopes-over-us-trade-talks-fed-rate-cuts-13534826.html,"The shares of IT companies sharply gained on September 10, pushing the sectoral index up more than 2 percent in the morning. The Nifty IT index led gains among the major sectoral indices, extending strong gains for the second consecutive session after five-day losing streak. The IT index rose to 36,075.95 in the morning. Here are the possible triggers for today's sharp rise: Trump says India-US trade talks to resume: The sharp rise in the IT stocks today was fuelled after US President Donald Trump said Washington and New Delhi will resume negotiations to resolve the ongoing trade frictions. In a social media post on Truth Social, Trump announced, ""I am pleased to announce that India, and the United States of America, are continuing negotiations to address the Trade Barriers between our two Nations."" ""I look forward to speaking with my very good friend, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in the upcoming weeks. I feel certain that there will be no difficulty in coming to a successful conclusion for both of our Great Countries!"" he further wrote. While the tariffs were not implemented on IT services, the easing trade tensions between India and US will likely benefit the IT companies which derive major portion of their revenue from the American markets. Rising hopes for Fed rate cut: The US Federal Reserve is set to hold its FOMC meeting from September 16 to September 17. Analysts increasingly expect the American central bank to cut its rates this time, amid weakening jobs data and rising pressure from President Donald Trump's administration. The US economy likely created 911,000 fewer jobs in the 12 months through March than previously estimated, according to the latest data from Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics. This further hiked rate cut hopes. A rate cut in the US will likely increase the discretionary spending capacity, which will likely help the IT companies which derive a major portion of their revenue from the American market. The IT stocks had surged yesterday as well, led by Infosys. This came after the company announced that its board will meet on September 11 to consider a proposal for buyback of fully paid-up equity shares. If approved, this will be the first buyback of shares announced by India's second-largest IT firm since 2022, when the company had agreed to a buyback proposal of Rs 9,300 crore with a minimum buyback price of Rs 1,850 per share. Oracle Financial Services Software (OFSS) shares were the top gainer on the Nifty IT index, rising nearly 8 percent. This comes after its parent company and NYSE-listed Oracle Corp issued an ambitious outlook for its cloud business, sending its shares to a record high. The company also announced huge layoffs. Persistent Systems shares jumped nearly 5 percent, while Mphasis shares were up 4 percent. Coforge and LTI Mindtree shares gained more than 3 percent each, while Wipro, HCL Tech and Tech Mahindra shares rose over 2 percent each. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) shares gained nearly 2 percent, while Infosys shares were up more than 1 percent. What lies ahead? ""The dual tailwinds from GST rationalization and anticipation of a U.S. Fed rate reduction are acting as a long-needed support to Indian equities, insulating them from global tariff and demand uncertainties,"" said Siddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director, Vibhavangal Anukulakara Pvt. Ltd. ""Though the IT industry has taken a hit this year, these decisions are evidence of resilience and the industry's core position in India's growth narrative. To investors, it is a reminder that long-term value resides in remaining aligned to structural pillars, even in times of short-term churn,"" the analyst added. Bhavik Joshi, Business Head, INVasset PMS, however advised caution. ""Foreign investors remain cautious, discouraging a sustained rally. While local policy cues and GST relief offer seasonal optimism, the lack of a sharp earnings turnaround or acceleration in contract wins keeps sentiment muted. The buyback announcement from Infosys may provide a short-lived jolt, yet the broader narrative remains one of structural caution rather than exuberance,"" he said. ""In essence, what separates IT from other sectors today is the 'global tether'. The expectation of a U.S. rate cut may lift overall market sentiment, but until global tech spend and deal pipelines visibly recover, IT will lag broader indices. For now, this underperformance reflects prudence—not weakness—and positions IT for a selective comeback once global visibility returns,"" he added. Renewed optimism around capital allocation, coupled with easing rate-cut expectations globally, fueled broad-based gains across the sector, said Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking. ""However, participants shouldn't get carried away with a single day move and should wait for some signs of stability citing the prolonged underperformance,"" he added.

Shares of OFSS rise over 7 percent after parent Oracle's shares rallied on $0.5 trillion cloud outlook,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/shares-of-ofss-rise-over-7-percent-on-parent-oracle-s-stellar-rally-after-0-5-trillion-cloud-business-outlook-13534505.html,"Shares of Oracle Financial soared over 7 percent in early trade on September 10 after the parent company and NYSE-listed Oracle Corp issued an ambitious outlook for its cloud business, sending its shares to a record high. Oracle had said on September 9 that it expects booked revenue for the Cloud Infrastructure business to exceed half a trillion dollars on rising demand for low-cost cloud services. ""Over the next few months, we expect to sign-up several additional multi-billion-dollar customers and RPO is likely to exceed half-a-trillion dollars,"" said CEO Safra Catz. For the September quarter, Oracle sees total revenue to rise to 12-14 percent and sees cloud revenue growth between 32-36 percent. Given the strong demand for AI business tools, Oracle is likely positioning itself to capture the demand, according to some IT analysts. ""We made it very easy for our customers to directly connect all their databases ... to the world's most advanced AI reasoning models — ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, all of which are uniquely available in the Oracle Cloud,"" Oracle CEO Catz said during the earnings call. According to Bloomberg, Oracle Corp's 28 percent rise during post-market trading is the biggest gain for the shares since 1999. If Oracle Corp's market rally sustains during the trading session on September 10, the company would surpass JPMorgan Chase, Walmart, Eli Lilly and Visa in terms of market capitalisation. Riding on an increasing demand for its cloud solutions, OFSS said its license and cloud revenue grew 13 percent over the last fiscal year. ""...The cloud-based solutions help organisations focus on smaller initiatives that deliver tangible and incremental value. Organisations can incrementally optimise their operations, boost efficiency, and thereby significantly reducing the transformation risk,"" Managing Director and the CEO Makarand Padalkar said during the AGM earlier this month. On a YTD basis, shares of Oracle Financial Services are down 28 percent."
"Apex Frozen, Gokaldas Exports, other shrimp & textile stocks rally up to 14% after Trump says trade talks with India to resume",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/apex-frozen-gokaldas-exports-other-shrimp-and-textile-stocks-rally-up-to-14-after-trump-hints-at-trade-talks-with-india-13534426.html,"The shares of export-oriented shrimp feed and textile companies surged in the early trading hours of September 10. This comes after US President Donald Trump said Washington and New Delhi will resume negotiations to resolve the ongoing trade frictions. In a social media post on Truth Social, Trump announced, ""I am pleased to announce that India, and the United States of America, are continuing negotiations to address the Trade Barriers between our two Nations."" ""I look forward to speaking with my very good friend, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in the upcoming weeks. I feel certain that there will be no difficulty in coming to a successful conclusion for both of our Great Countries!"" he further wrote. The shares of these export-oriented companies had significantly declined earlier after the Trump administration increased tariffs on Indian imports to a whopping 50 percent, citing New Delhi's continued purchase of Russian oil. However, Trump's latest comment may have boosted investor sentiment on the possibility of the two countries concluding their long-awaited tariff deal. Additionally, the US Supreme Court has agreed to decide the legality of Donald Trump's sweeping global tariffs. This comes after a lower court ruled that Trump’s tariffs were illegal. Apex Frozen Foods shares rallied nearly 14 percent to trade at Rs 251 apiece. Avanti Feeds surged more than 9 percent, while Coastal Corporation shares jumped over 5 percent. Gokaldas Exports shares surged nearly 7 percent, while KPR Mill shares were up around 3 percent. Raymond Lifestyle gained nearly 2 percent, while Welspun Living shares surged more than 7 percent. Arvind shares were up over 4 percent. ""A major positive for the market today comes from President Trump’s initiative to improve India-U.S. relations and PM Modi’s positive response to the same. However, from past experience the market should judge President Trump by his actions and not words,"" said VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited.

Asian Equities (Gain) Asian stocks advanced Wednesday as technology shares powered gains and on hopes the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates to curb a jobs downturn. US Equities (Up) Wall Street's three main indexes scored record high closes on Tuesday, while UnitedHealth rallied, and a downward payrolls revision supported expectations the Federal Reserve will soon cut interest rates to shore up economic growth. The S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones Industrial Average each ended with fresh all-time highs, extending a rally this year fueled by excitement about artificial intelligence and expectations of lower borrowing costs. The S&P 500 climbed 0.27% to end the session at 6,512.61 points, surpassing its record last Thursday. The Nasdaq gained 0.37% to 21,879.49 points, its second consecutive record high close.

Asian stocks fluctuate as US jobs outlook cools,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/asian-stocks-fluctuate-as-us-jobs-outlook-cools-13533819.html,"Key Asian stock gauges fluctuated Wednesday after the S&P 500 hit a record on hopes the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates to curb a jobs downturn. Shares in South Korea rose in early trading, while those in Japan and Australia were mixed. US equity futures contracts edged higher after Big Tech lifted the index on Tuesday, even as most shares fell and Apple Inc. sank following its iPhone 17 launch. Treasuries edged higher early Wednesday. Oil extended gains after an Israeli attack in Qatar revived fears of an escalation of the Middle East conflict. After fresh signs of a cooling labor market, investors are bracing for inflation reports in the coming days that will help shape next week’s Fed meeting and the path of rate cuts into 2025 — a key test for whether Wall Street can sustain this month’s rally. Money markets are almost fully projecting three Fed cuts this year, with US producer and consumer price index data due this week. “The markets appear to believe will be enough to protect the US economy from a recession, judging by current risk appetite,” said Kyle Rodda, a market analyst at Capital.com in Melbourne. “A spicy inflation print would complicate this situation and force the Fed into potential nasty trade offs between the labor market and price stability.” In Asia, traders will monitor the potential for joint action by the US and the European Union to pressure Russia into Ukraine talks. President Donald Trump said he’s prepared to join the bloc to impose sweeping new tariffs on China and India — key buyers of Russian oil — and also said he plans to discuss trade with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi “in the coming weeks.” Investors are also awaiting China’s August print for factory-gate prices and consumer prices to gauge the economic impact of the government’s anti-involution campaign and the ongoing deflationary pressure. The yen was little changed early Wednesday after gaining Tuesday, following a report that Bank of Japan officials may raise interest rates again this year, regardless of domestic political instability. Fed Meeting Back in the US, the most relevant question now becomes the extent to which the August inflation data will reshape the market’s expectations for the Fed’s decision next week, according to Ian Lyngen and Vail Hartman at BMO Capital Markets. “The Fed is cutting 25 basis points — barring a far more dramatic downshift in the trajectory of realized inflation, in which case a half-point cut could be on the table,” they said. “We’re solidly in the quarter-point camp and view the August inflation update as more meaningful for the conversations about where the Fed cutting cycle ends, not how it begins.” In the run-up to the inflation reports, government data showed US job growth was far less robust in the year through March than previously reported. The number of workers on payrolls will likely be revised down by a record 911,000, or 0.6%, according to the preliminary benchmark revision out Tuesday. The final figures are due early next year. Jamie Dimon said the record revision to US payrolls data is further proof that the US economy is battling a slowdown. “The economy is weakening,” the JPMorgan Chase & Co. chief executive officer said in an interview with CNBC Tuesday. “Whether that is on the way to recession or just weakening, I don’t know.”"
"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Kansai Nerolac Paints, KEC International, Azad Engineering, RITES, Mphasis, SBI Card, and others on September 10?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-kansai-nerolac-paints-kec-international-azad-engineering-rites-mphasis-sbi-card-and-others-on-september-10-13533782.html,"The benchmark indices gained 0.39 percent on September 9, continuing their upward journey for the fifth consecutive session, but the market breadth was slightly negative. About 1,424 shares declined, against 1,350 rising shares on the NSE. The market is expected to consolidate before entering a fresh leg of upmove. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors Kansai Nerolac Paints | CMP: Rs 248.67 In the previous session, Kansai Nerolac Paints gave a breakout of the downward sloping channel. Also, since August 25, prices have protected the prior day’s low on a closing basis, suggesting strength in the ongoing trend. Additionally, prices have broken above the upper Bollinger Bands, suggesting a continuation of positive momentum in the coming sessions. Along with this, the KST (Know Sure Thing) indicator has already turned above the signal line and is now about to cross the zero line, suggesting that further good momentum is likely to build up. The stock is now trading at an important resistance area near Rs 252; a decisive breakout above this level is required for bullish momentum to continue. A break above Rs 252 could push prices higher towards Rs 264, followed by Rs 275. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 264, Rs 275 Stop-Loss: Rs 240 KEC International | CMP: Rs 879.15 At the start of September, KEC International found support on the upward sloping trendline, and we saw a sharp reversal of nearly 10% to the upside. The stock has been consistently outperforming its peers over the past week. In the previous session, prices finally closed above the prior day’s high after four days of consolidation, which is a positive sign. On the daily chart, the 15-day EMA has just crossed the 30 EMA, which is considered a bullish crossover, indicating that the short-term bias has turned positive. With follow-up buying, a move toward the previous important resistance near Rs 950 is expected. For now, a break above Rs 890 could start a fresh upside move toward Rs 950. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 950 Stop-Loss: Rs 850 JSW Infrastructure | CMP: Rs 313 In the previous session, JSW Infrastructure was up nearly 4%, supported by a surge in volumes, the highest since July 2025. On the daily chart, not a single candle has closed below the prior day’s low for the past two trading sessions, which is a positive sign. The stock is trading in a rectangular range of Rs 294–315 since July 2025, indicating accumulation. If prices manage to break above Rs 315, it could result in a bullish breakout from the pattern. Additionally, the MACD has just shown a bullish crossover, and follow-up buying is now required to confirm the same. A break Rs 315 could lead to a trending move toward Rs 332, followed by Rs 350. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 332, Rs 350 Stop-Loss: Rs 298 Nandish Shah, Senior Technical and Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities NLC India | CMP: Rs 239 The short-term trend of NLC India remains positive as it is placed above its 5-, 11-, and 20-day EMAs. The primary trend turned positive as the stock price closed above its 200-day EMA. Accumulation has been seen in the stock over the past few months as volumes on up days have been higher than on down days. Momentum indicators and oscillators are showing strength in the current uptrend. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 251, Rs 260 Stop-Loss: Rs 228 Azad Engineering | CMP: Rs 1,650 Azad Engineering’s price has broken out on the daily chart from a downward sloping trendline connecting the highs of June 2 and September 4. The stock has been forming a bullish higher top–higher bottom pattern on the daily charts. Momentum indicators and oscillators, like RSI and MFI, are in rising mode and are placed above 60, suggesting strength in the current bullish trend. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,740, Rs 1,800 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,570 RITES | CMP: Rs 270 The primary trend turned positive as RITES closed above its 200-day EMA. The stock has broken out on the daily chart from a downward sloping trendline connecting the highs of June 5 and July 2. The price rise is accompanied by a rise in volumes, suggesting strength in the uptrend. Momentum indicators and oscillators, like RSI and MFI, are in rising mode and placed above 60 on the daily chart. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 286, Rs 295 Stop-Loss: Rs 256 Amol Athawale, VP Technical Research at Kotak Securities Mphasis | CMP: Rs 2,853.3 After a sharp uptrend rally, Mphasis witnessed a bit of selling pressure, but eventually, the downward momentum paused, and the stock has found support. On the weekly charts, the stock has formed a cup-and-handle type formation, and a fresh breakout from the resistance zone is very likely in the coming trading sessions. As long as the stock is trading above Rs 2,760, the bullish texture is likely to continue. Above this level, the stock could move up to Rs 3,050. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,050 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,760 SBI Cards and Payment Services | CMP: Rs 819.35 On the daily scale, after a correction from higher levels, SBI Card was trading in a range-bound mode. However, it has now given a range breakout along with good volumes. Additionally, the RSI is indicating further uptrend from current levels, which could boost bullish sentiment. Therefore, the closing above the resistance line indicates that further bullish momentum is likely to continue in the near term. For positional traders, Rs 790 would be the decisive level. Trading above this level, the uptrend formation will likely continue up to Rs 880. However, if it closes below Rs 790, traders may prefer to exit long positions. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 880 Stop-Loss: Rs 790 Reliance Industries | CMP: Rs 1,376.2 Reliance Industries is in an accumulation zone, trading in a range-bound manner on the daily scale. However, recent bullish activity near the breakout zone of the range is indicating good strength. The stock is expected to break out and witness a fresh upmove from current levels, with a favourable risk–reward perspective. Over the next few trading sessions, Rs 1,340 could be the trend-decider level for bulls. If it sustains above Rs 1,340, we can expect a further uptrend toward Rs 1,470. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,470 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,340 Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Markets extend gains on IT surge; Infosys share buyback buzz lifts sentiment,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/markets-extend-gains-on-it-surge-infosys-share-buyback-buzz-lifts-sentiment-13532988.html,"India’s benchmark indices closed higher for the fifth straight session on September 9, led by a rebound in software exporters after Infosys announced it would consider a share buyback. The rally tracked firm global markets, with investors betting on the likelihood of a U.S. Federal Reserve rate cut at its upcoming policy meeting. At close, the Sensex rose 314 points, or 0.39 percent, to 81,101, while the Nifty 50 gained 95.45 points, or 0.39 percent, to settle at 24,868.60. The rupee also strengthened against the U.S. dollar, recovering from record lows touched last week. “Domestic equities edged higher on positive global cues, with IT stocks rallying on Infosys’s buyback announcement despite prevailing headwinds. Auto stocks, however, saw profit-booking after recent gains on GST rationalisation. While sentiment remains range-bound amid global uncertainties, prospects of a Fed rate cut and supportive domestic macros may sustain optimism in the near term,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services. Infosys was the top contributor to the Nifty’s gains, surging 5 percent—its steepest rise since May 12. Tech Mahindra, HCL Tech and TCS advanced between 1 percent and 2 percent, lifting the Nifty IT index 2.7 percent. Pharma and FMCG added 1 percent and 0.6 percent, respectively, while Realty and Oil & Gas slipped 0.2 percent each. On the technical front, Nifty reclaimed its 100-day moving average at 24,820. “Momentum indicators have turned positive, with the RSI crossing above 50, pointing to short-term bullishness. However, the index faces a crucial resistance near the 25,000 mark. A decisive breakout above this zone is required to confirm a fresh upward leg, while immediate support lies at the 21-DMA of 24,720,” said Nilesh Jain, Head – Technical and Derivatives Research, Centrum Broking. Investor focus now shifts to key U.S. inflation prints, with producer price data due Wednesday and consumer price data on Thursday."

On the back of positive global markets, Indian indices opened with a gain and despite intraday profit booking the indices managed to hold on to the gains with Nifty inching closer to 24,900, intraday, before closing near day's high. At close, the Sensex was up 314.02 points or 0.39 percent at 81,101.32, and the Nifty was up 95.45 points or 0.39 percent at 24,868.60. BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices were up 0.2% each.

Click to View More Outlook for September 10 Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities After showing weakness from the highs on Monday, Nifty continued with range bound action with positive bias on Tuesday and closed the day with modest gains of 95 points. After opening with an upside gap of 90 points, the market shifted into a narrow high low range movement that lasted for the whole session. The opening upside gap remains unfilled and Nifty closed at the highs. A small candle was formed on the daily chart with minor upper and lower shadow and with almost identical open and close. This market action indicates a formation of doji type candle pattern. But, having formed this pattern amidst a broader range bound action, the predictive value of this pattern could be less. The underlying trend of Nifty remains positive with choppy movement. Nifty is apparently creating base for decisive upside breakout of important resistance zone of around 24900-25000 levels (down sloping trend line and recent weekly highs). Immediate support is placed at 24750. Vaibhav Vidwani, Research Analyst at Bonanza Today, the Indian stock market closed on a positive note, with both the Nifty 50 and Sensex ending higher buoyed mainly by robust gains in the IT sector, alongside favourable global cues and renewed investor confidence in large cap names. The Nifty 50 settled at 24,868.6, rising 95 points (+0.39%), while the Sensex closed at 81,101.32, up 314 points (+0.39%). The positive close was propelled by strong buying in IT stocks, with the Nifty IT index rallying 2.8%. The rally gained traction after Infosys announced a proposed share buyback, which improved sentiment across the sector. Global equity optimism, on account of expectations for US Federal Reserve interest rate cuts and strong recent performances of US tech indices like Nasdaq, created a tailwind for domestic technology stocks. Additionally, a steady rupee and stable oil prices added to the upbeat market mood. Sectoral rotation saw midcaps remain subdued and profit-booking in autos after Monday’s sharp rally. Broad-based gains in IT, pharma, and FMCG stocks lifted the benchmarks, while realty, auto, and oil & gas sectors saw some selling. Market breadth was mixed, while large caps shone, midcap and smallcap participation was muted. Investors are closely watching upcoming inflation data from India and the US for clues on the Federal Reserve’s rate outlook, which will remain key for short term direction. The proposed second weekly derivatives expiry on Nifty supports current volumes and volatility. With a positive undertone and sectoral rotation fueling resilience in large caps, near term market trajectory is likely to hinge on global monetary signals and domestic macro numbers.

Buy Ujjivan Small Finance Bank; target of Rs 60: Emkay Global Financial,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-ujjivan-small-finance-bank-target-of-rs-60-emkay-global-financial-13531986.html,"Emkay Global Financial' research report on Ujjivan Small Finance Bank Ujjivan SFB hosted an analyst meet to present its long-term strategic plan encompassing ambitious growth over FY26-30E – 3x FY25 GLP at Rs1trn with 65-70% of the portfolio being secured and to still deliver sustained healthy RoA of 1.8-2%, mainly aided by better operational efficiency (C/A ratio less than 5% vs more than 6% now) and credit cost (~1-1.5% from over 2%). The mgmt claims that this strategic plan is Universal-bank-license-agnostic and expects to secure the license by Dec-25. However, we believe scaling up liability is a major challenge (targets 35% by FY30 vs 24% now) as an SFB, which should receive some boost by the ‘Universal Bank’ tag. Near term, the bank remains focused on managing asset quality, which it expects to gradually improve, and aims to be more visible from 2H. We trim our earnings estimate by 5-9%, building in some margin moderation/higher opex in the interim, though we expect Ujjivan to deliver 1.7-2% RoA over FY27-28E (from 1.3% in FY26E) led by MFI recovery. Outlook With the stock trading at 1.1x Sep-27E ABV—well below AU SFB’s 2.1x (which recently secured a Universal Bank license)—we believe it could re-rate as MFI recovery gathers steam, coupled with a Universal Bank license. We retain BUY and TP of Rs60 (rolling forward on 1.5x Sep-27E ABV).

"Nifty IT index rises 3%, snaps five-day losses; Infosys, Wipro lead gains: Here are three reasons",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/nifty-it-index-rises-2-snaps-five-day-losses-infosys-wipro-lead-gains-here-are-three-reasons-13531508.html,"The shares of IT companies surged on September 9, pushing the sectoral index sharply into the green. The Nifty IT index rose nearly 3 percent, snapping a five-day losing streak. The IT index ended the session at 35,255.90. It was the top sectoral gainer on the market today. Infosys shares led the gains, jumping nearly 5 percent to trade at Rs 1,502.40 apiece. Wipro shares followed, surging nearly 3 percent. Tech Mahindra, Persistent Systems and Mphasis shares gained more than 2 percent each, while Coforge, LTI Mindtree and HCL Technologies shares rose nearly 2 percent. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) shares were up more than 1 percent. Here are the possible triggers for the sharp rise: US Fed rate cut expectations: The US Federal Reserve is set to hold its FOMC meeting from September 16 to September 17. Analysts increasingly expect the American central bank to cut its rates this time, amid weakening jobs data and rising pressure from President Donald Trump's administration. Analysts now expect a 50-basis point rate cut at the September FOMC meeting. ""August labor market data has paved the way for a 'catch-up' 50 basis point rate cut at the September FOMC meeting, similar to what occurred at this time last year,"" said Standard Chartered in its latest note, doubling its earlier projection of a 25-bp reduction, following a soft August jobs report. A rate cut in the US will likely increase the discretionary spending capacity, which will likely help the IT companies which derive a major portion of their revenue from the American market. Infosys board to consider share buyback proposal: The shares of Infosys jumped more than 4 percent after the company announced that its board will meet on September 11 to consider a proposal for buyback of fully paid-up equity shares. If approved, this will be the first buyback of shares announced by India's second-largest IT firm since 2022, when the company had agreed to a buyback proposal of Rs 9,300 crore with a minimum buyback price of Rs 1,850 per share. Infosys made the announcement in the post market hours of September 8. The stock jumped more than 4 percent to trade at Rs 1,494 apiece on September 9, snapping a five-session losing streak. It is currently the top gainer on the Nifty IT index, as well as benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty. The sharp rise in heavyweight Infosys was the top contributor to the rise in the Nifty IT index. Value buying: The IT stocks have seen significant correction in recent days, amid tariff uncertainties and global worries. The Nifty IT index dropped nearly 4 percent in just five consecutive sessions. The sharp rise in the sector today may come as investors resort to value buying after significant correction. ""The IT stocks' rise today, especially with Infosys' buyback offer, highlights the speed at which sentiment can shift to positive when there are global and local triggers. The dual tailwinds from GST rationalization and anticipation of a U.S. Fed rate reduction are acting as a long-needed support to Indian equities, insulating them from global tariff and demand uncertainties,"" said Siddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director, Vibhavangal Anukulakara Pvt. Ltd. ""Though the IT industry has taken a hit this year, these decisions are evidence of resilience and the industry's core position in India's growth narrative. To investors, it is a reminder that long-term value resides in remaining aligned to structural pillars, even in times of short-term churn,"" the analyst added. Bhavik Joshi, Business Head, INVasset PMS, however advised caution. ""Foreign investors remain cautious, discouraging a sustained rally. While local policy cues and GST relief offer seasonal optimism, the lack of a sharp earnings turnaround or acceleration in contract wins keeps sentiment muted. The buyback announcement from Infosys may provide a short-lived jolt, yet the broader narrative remains one of structural caution rather than exuberance,"" he said. ""In essence, what separates IT from other sectors today is the 'global tether'. The expectation of a U.S. rate cut may lift overall market sentiment, but until global tech spend and deal pipelines visibly recover, IT will lag broader indices. For now, this underperformance reflects prudence—not weakness—and positions IT for a selective comeback once global visibility returns,"" he added. Renewed optimism around capital allocation, coupled with easing rate-cut expectations globally, fueled broad-based gains across the sector, said Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking. ""However, participants shouldn't get carried away with a single day move and should wait for some signs of stability citing the prolonged underperformance,"" he added.

Earlier this year, Ichnos Glenmark Innovation (IGI) and AbbVie had announced an exclusive Global LicensingAgreement for ISB 2001, which is a Trispecific Antibody for Multiple Myeloma.

Read More: A $2 billion shot in the arm: Why Glenmark’s AbbVie deal could trigger re-rating The exclusive global licensing pact features $700 million as upfront payment and $1.225 billion in milestones, in addition to tiered, double-digit royalties on net sales. In an interview with Moneycontrol on July 14, Glenn Saldanha, Chairman and Managing Director of Glenmark said the deal with AbbVie has 'de-risked' the company and made the R&D unit self-sufficient and self-sustaining for at least 3-4 years. ""Effectively, by partnering, we've passed on the risk and de-risked ourselves. We've taken some money off the table. Crucially, we've retained the rights for emerging markets, including India. So, we've basically de-risked part of the asset by partnering with a big pharma and effectively monetising it,"" Glenn Saldanha said. Glenmark is India’s 11th largest pharma company by market capitalisation and 12th in terms of FY25 revenue."

Asian Equities (Gain) Asian stocks climbed on Tuesday as Wall Street’s upbeat mood ahead of expected Federal Reserve rate cuts flowed into regional trading. US Equities (Gain) The Nasdaq notched a record high close on Monday, lifted by a rally in Broadcom, while the S&P 500 also gained as investors bet the Federal Reserve will soon lower borrowing costs to shore up economic growth. Investors expect multiple interest rate cuts this year after a troubling nonfarm payrolls report on Friday added to concerns about a weakening U.S. job market. The report, which had dragged down Wall Street in the previous session, has stoked fears of a potential slowdown in the world's biggest economy. The S&P 500 climbed 0.21% to end at 6,495.15 points. The Nasdaq gained 0.45% to 21,798.70 points, its highest close ever. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.25% to 45,514.95 points. The S&P 500 is up about 10% so far in 2025, and the Nasdaq has climbed about 13%. US Bond Yield (Flat) The yield on 10-year Treasuries was little changed at 4.04%, while the 10-year Treasury yield was around 3.49% Dollar Index (Flat) The dollar sank to an almost seven-week low on Tuesday as investors braced for U.S. data revisions that could show the job markets in worse shape than initially thought, shoring up the case for even deeper Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. Asian currencies (Up) All the Asian currencies were trading higher in the early Tuesday trade with the Indonesian Rupiah leading the gainers, followed by the Thai Baht, the Taiwan Dollar, the Malaysian Ringgit, the Japanese Yen, the China Renminbi, Singapore Dollar.

Asian stocks rise to track US optimism on Fed cuts,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/asian-stocks-rise-to-track-us-optimism-on-fed-cuts-13530738.html,"Asian stocks climbed on Tuesday as Wall Street’s upbeat mood ahead of expected Federal Reserve rate cuts flowed into regional trading. Equities in Japan and South Korea rose in morning trading while those in Australia declined. The moves followed a surge in bets on rate cuts by the US central bank that pushed stocks near record highs on hopes that easier policy will bolster corporate America. The S&P 500 rebounded Monday after a selloff the prior session due to the weak jobs report. Even as upcoming data is projected to show stalled progress on reducing inflation, traders expect almost three Fed cuts this year, starting this month. Treasuries were steady, with the two-year yield remaining at its lowest since 2022. The dollar fell and gold stayed around record high levels. “After last week’s tepid jobs numbers, it will likely take a major upside surprise from this week’s inflation data to derail a Fed rate cut next week,” said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley. Fed officials have signaled concerns are shifting from the inflation risks posed by tariffs to weakness in the job market. Steady inflation expectations are an indication that tariffs could prove a one-time price shock. That’s even if they take several months to work their way through the economy. Ahead of next week’s Fed meeting, Thursday’s core consumer price index is projected to show a 0.3% increase in August for a second month. Before that, figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Tuesday will likely unveil another US jobs markdown that will set the stage for a rate cut. “While the Sept. 5 report showed job growth had slowed, it doesn’t appear to be signaling a recession,” according to the Invesco Global Market Strategy Office. “Slower growth, anchored inflation expectations, falling yields, and anticipated rate cuts point to an optimistic outlook for stocks.” Elsewhere, Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto abruptly replaced Sri Mulyani Indrawati as finance minister, risking renewed financial turmoil for Southeast Asia’s biggest economy following violent protests in recent weeks against his administration. In Japan, the implications of the nation’s latest political turmoil has spilled into markets. Long-maturity Japanese government bonds slumped Monday as Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba’s decision to step down underscored expectations for looser fiscal policy. China’s export growth slowed to the weakest in six months as a slump in shipments to the US deepened again, although a surge in sales to other markets kept Beijing on track for a record trade surplus. To Megan Horneman at Verdence Capital Advisors, upcoming inflation data probably won’t be enough to change the likelihood of a Fed reduction in September. The biggest question for investors now is how many more rate cuts we will receive. “After this week’s inflation data, we will get a better picture on what the Fed can do with rates,” Horneman said. “However, we are not out of the woods with inflation, and the Fed may deliver a ‘hawkish cut’ while reminding investors of their dual mandate, especially if inflation continues to move further away from their target.” In commodities, oil rose for a second day as investors weighed the the prospect for softening demand after Saudi Arabia cut pricing for most of its grades."

Further, the RSI breakout signals improving momentum, adding conviction to the positive outlook.

After a positive opening, the benchmark indices extended the gains as the day progress with Nifty hitting day's high of 24,885.50, however, the last hour profit booking erased most of the gains to close near day's low.

Click to View More Outlook for September 9 Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities After witnessing a sustainable recovery from the lows on Friday, Nifty encountered hurdle around 24900 levels on Monday and showed profit booking from the highs and closed with the gains of 32 points. A small red candle was formed on the daily chart with long upper shadow. Technically, this market action indicates a consolidation movement in the market with volatility. Though, buying is emerging from the lows, the market is finding stiff resistance of around 24900-25000 levels (down sloping trend line on the daily chart and previous weekly highs). However, Nifty manages to close above the daily 10/20-day EMA around 24730 levels. The underlying trend of Nifty remains positive with choppy movement. Having placed below the crucial overhead resistance around 24900-25000 levels, there is a possibility of some more consolidation or minor weakness in the next 1-2 sessions. Immediate support is placed at 24620. A decisive upside above 25000 is likely to open sharp buying in the market. Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets started the week on a positive note and ended with modest gains amid mixed cues. After opening firm above the 24,800 mark, the Nifty gradually moved higher through the day; however, sharp profit-taking in the final hour trimmed the gains. On the sectoral front, autos,realty and metals were among the performers, while IT and FMCG lagged. Broader markets displayed resilience, with the Nifty Midcap and Smallcap indices closing modestly higher—underlining sustained interest in the wider universe. Investor sentiment was supported by the GST rate cut tailwinds and dovish signals from the US Federal Reserve, which bolstered rate-cut hopes after weak US jobs data. Easing geopolitical risks and optimism around India’s domestic economic outlook also lent support to select sectors. However, persistent foreign institutional selling and speculation over potential restrictions on IT services exports capped the upside. Fund flows reflected a tug-of-war between FII outflows and robust DII buying, a typical feature of markets at an inflection point. On the index front, we expect the prevailing tussle to end only with a decisive breakout above the 25,000 mark on the Nifty, while the 24,400–24,600 zone should act as a cushion. We suggest closely tracking the performance of banking and IT majors for the next directional move in the index. Meanwhile, traders should continue to focus on other sectors that are holding firm and participating on a rotational basis.

This growth builds on the foundation since obtaining its small finance bank license in 2017. The bank's strategy centers on expanding its liability franchise, broadening its asset product range, and streamlining operations for sustained profitability. Ujjivan is actively diversifying its loan portfolio. Secured lending has increased from 16% in FY19 to 46% as of Q1FY26. The lender aims to increase the share of secured loans to approximately 65%-70%, focusing on Affordable Housing, Micro Mortgages, MSME lending, Vehicle Finance, Gold Loans, and Agri Loans. The bank also intends to introduce products for Mid Corporate Lending. Ujjivan has established a granular liability franchise with retail deposits (CASA and retail term deposits) constituting 72% of the total deposit base. As of Q1FY26, the total deposit base stood at ₹38,619 crore. CASA balances were reported at ₹9,381 crore, representing 24.3% of deposits as of Q1FY26. The long-term goal is to increase CASA to 35% of total deposits by FY30. This CASA growth will be supported by an expanded branch network from 752 to approximately 1,150 branches, deeper cross-selling efforts, and a comprehensive suite of products, including IPO-ASBA, insurance, mutual fund distribution, remittances, and co-branded credit cards. Ujjivan reported a CRAR of 22.8% and Tier I at 21.2% as of Q1FY26, indicating a strong capital position. The shift toward secured loans with lower risk weights enhances capital efficiency and provides headroom for long-term growth without requiring immediate capital raising. Sanjeev Nautiyal, Managing Director & CEO of Ujjivan Small Finance Bank, commented, ""Our roadmap to a ₹1 lakh crore gross loan book by FY30 builds on the foundation established since becoming a small finance bank. We have grown our gross loan book from ₹7,560 crore in FY17 to ₹33,287 crore in Q1FY26."" The bank's strategy includes expanding its branch network from 752 to around 1,150, increasing the secured share of the loan book to 65%-70%, raising CASA to 35% of deposits, and doubling branch productivity. Ujjivan expects annual Gross Loan Book growth in the range of 20%-25%, with the objective of achieving RoE of 16%-18% and RoA of 1.8%—2.0% in FY30. The bank serves a diversified customer base of over 97 Lakhs across 26 states & Union Territories. Ujjivan Small Finance Bank Limited operates as a scheduled commercial bank in India, serving approximately 97 lakh customers through 754 branches and 613 ATMs/ACRs across 326 districts and 26 states and union territories. The gross loan book stands at ₹33,287 crore, with a deposit base of ₹38,619 crore as of June 30, 2025. The bank holds a credit rating of AA- (Stable)/A1+ from CARE/CRISIL.

KTAs: 1) The acquisition (not built in) is in line with CEAT’s capital allocation priorities and supports its 3 growth pillars – premiumization, globalization, higher margin OHT. 2) CEAT plans to invest USD171mn in upstream capacities and working capital (part of USD225mn deal value; balance USD44mn payable after 3Y for the brand). 3) FY26 revenue run-rate of USD130-140mnpa (FY23: USD213mn); near term subdued on phased customer transition and margin softness, amid interim sourcing from Michelin; margin to inch up to high teens, to 20% in 4-6Q. 4) Camso’s US/EU exposure: 50/36%, which is competitive despite tariffs (20% in SL; no local US manufacturing). 5) Due to Rs10bn core capex and Michelin payout (USD137mn), a Rs10-12bn debt hit is seen in FY26; consol leverage to be comfortable. Despite Camso’s near-term softness, CEAT poised to disproportionately benefit from demand upturn, on strong consumer facing segment exposure, sustained share-gain across categories, exports/OHT focus with LT benefits from Camso (refer to Voice of the head: Cusp of entering a new league). Outlook We highlight potential ~4-6% near-term earnings risk, on transitory headwinds at Camso (expected at 12-18M on the RM front and much less on the sales front, per management), though likely to lead to ~13% EPS accretion on normalized basis; retain BUY; TP: Rs4,600, at 20x Jun-27E PER.

KTAs: 1) Having outperformed the auto industry 2.5x faster in last 5Y, SAMIL has set its sight on USD108bn revenue (4x vs USD25.7bn in FY25) and 40% ROCE by FY30. 2) SAMIL has strategically seeded several emerging businesses (aerospace, consumer electronics, etc) in the last 5Y, positioning itself to capture global opportunities. 3) SAMIL has prioritized emerging market greenfields in last 5Y (mainly India) and is further sharpening its India emphasis. 4) SAMIL has been hand-picked by one of the largest global consumer electronics brands, entrusting it to develop the electronics ecosystem in India with a multibillion-dollar orderbook and profitable operations from Day 1. 5) SAMIL has built one of India’s fastest growing aerospace businesses (+USD1bn orderbook; only Indian exporter to Japan) despite its recent entry, thus cementing a path for accelerated growth up the value chain, also via strategic M&A (France-based AD Industries for propulsion systems). 6) Graduating from basic components to integrated assemblies, SAMIL aims for full car assembly by FY30. 7) Chinese OEMs are spreading wings globally and SAMIL intends capturing this opportunity by leveraging its dominant global manufacturing presence. 8) The mgmt also hinted at potential independent listing of certain businesses upon maturity. Outlook We believe that over next 5Y, newer businesses (esp consumer electronics) and its India focus would drive a major delta in SAMIL’s growth trajectory. We retain BUY; TP unchanged at Rs120.

The lender added that it does not see any immediate need for raising capital, and aims to ramp up the secured loan book to 65-70 percent with CASA at 35 percent of its term deposits. This growth will be supported by an expansion of the bank's branch network from 752 to nearly 1,150 branches, Ujjivan said, adding that it aims to increase cross-selling to its customer base, including offerings such as IPO-ASBA, insurance, mutual fund distribution, remittances and co-branded credit cards. Sanjeev Nautiyal, Managing Director & CEO, Ujjivan Small Finance Bank said, ""Our roadmap to a Rs 1 lakh crore gross loan book by FY30 builds on the foundation established since becoming a small finance bank. Over this period, we have grown our gross loan book from Rs 7,560 crore in FY17 to Rs 33,287 crore in Q1FY26."" In five years, the SFB sees its average liability per branch to nearly double from Rs 51 crore to around Rs 102 crore. The lender said aims to widen and build its secured loan book portfolio to nearly 65-70 percent. ""Ujjivan has been gradually diversifying its loan portfolio with secured lending increasing from 16 percent in FY19 to 46 percent as on Q1FY26. The bank aims to raise the share of its secured loan book to approximately 65-70 percent, led by growth in Affordable Housing, Micro Mortgages, MSME lending, Vehicle Finance, Gold Loans and Agri Loans,"" the SFB said in a statement. ""The shift in asset book towards secured loans with lower risk weights not only enhances capital efficiency but also provides headroom to support long-term growth without immediate need for raising capital,"" the lender said. Ujjivan said it now has a 'granular liability franchise' with retail deposits (CASA and retail deposits) forming 72 percent of the total deposit base of Rs 38,619 crore as of Q1FY26. The CASA balance stood at Rs 9,381 crore, which is 24.3 percent its total deposits, and the lender said it plan to take this to 35 percent of the total deposits by FY30, with Net Interest Margin (NIM) seen around 6-7 percent by FY30. Additionally, the SFB is targetting to widen its product offering by adding solutions in the mid-corporate lending space, underscoring its reliance on micro banking portfolio of group loans, which is the foundation, with customers graduating to individual loans. With an aim of profitable growth, the bank has committed to focus on optimising its digital stack, right-sizing the employee count and operational expenses. The SFB is hopeful of enhanced productivity and a 'prudent' rollout of branch and physical infrastructure. ""These will enable us to bring our cost to income ratio close to 55%. Combining this with our credit underwriting and collections mechanism will help deliver RoA of 1.8%-2.0% through prudent leverage and RoE of 16-18 percent by FY30,"" Ujjivan SFB said. On a YTD basis, shares of Ujjivan Small Finance Bank are higher by 28 percent. The lender added that it remains comfortably capitalized as of Q1FY26."

SpiceJet shares drop 5% after airline swings into red in Q1 with Rs 234-crore net loss,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/spicejet-shares-drop-5-after-airline-swings-into-red-in-q1-with-rs-234-crore-net-loss-13528785.html,"The shares of SpiceJet dropped more than 5 percent on September 8 after the airline reported a consolidated net loss of Rs 233.85 crore for the first quarter of the financial year 2026, as against a net profit of Rs 158.3 crore in the same period last year. The company released its results for the April-June quarter in the post market hours of September 5. The airline's revenue from operations meanwhile dropped around 34 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,120.2 crore during Q1 FY26. It had reported revenue from operations at Rs 1,708.2 crore in Q1 FY25. Passenger revenue per available seat kilometre (PAX RASK) stood at Rs 4.74 during the quarter. Passenger load factor (PLF) meanwhile was reported at 86 percent. Elara Capital cut its target price for the stock by more than 37 percent to Rs 39 per share after the release of the results, while maintaining its 'Accumulate' rating. The latest target price implies an upside potential of nearly 13 percent over the previous closing price. ""A significant uptick in fleet size is awaited for growth. We trim our FY26E EPS estimates to negative INR 8.1 from INR 10.2 profit previously. We introduce FY27E and FY28E EPS at INR 0.4 and INR 1.4, assuming a decline in CASK to INR 4.7 by FY27E/28E from INR 5.4 in FY26E. We assume RASK during FY26E-28E at INR 5.2-5.4 and 41% passenger CAGR in FY25-28E due to fleet growth to 52 from ~20 currently,” the domestic brokerage said. Speaking about the net loss, SpiceJet said that it was impacted by costs related to grounded aircraft and expenses towards their return to service. It however added that its net worth position strengthened significantly, rising to Rs 446 crore during the quarter under review, as compared to the earlier deficit of Rs 2,398 crore in Q1 FY25. ""The results were significantly impacted by geo‐political situation with a neighbouring country and airspace restrictions in key markets, which led to subdued leisure travel demand,"" SpiceJet said. Ajay Singh, Chairman and Managing Director of SpiceJet, said, ""This quarter’s results reflect the extraordinary challenges faced by the aviation industry, including geopolitical turbulence, restricted air routes, and supply chain disruptions. Despite these headwinds, SpiceJet continues to demonstrate resilience. We are taking decisive steps to enhance fleet reliability, reduce costs, and expand our network. With India’s aviation and tourism sectors among the fastest‐growing globally, we remain confident of a strong recovery trajectory in the coming quarters."" Also read: Our LIVE blog on stock market updates SpiceJet shares later recovered some losses and were trading over 2 percent lower at Rs 33.62 apiece. This came after the company in an exchange filing announced that it has completed the full payment of $24 Million to Credit Suisse, thereby fulfilling in entirety the terms of the settlement agreement signed between the two parties in May 2022. The stock has fallen around 8 percent in the past five days, and around 33 percent in the past six months. The shares of the airline have declined more than 41 percent in the past one year.

"Avanti Feeds, Gokaldas Exports, other shrimp and textile stocks jump up to 5%: Here's why",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/avanti-feeds-gokaldas-exports-other-shrimp-and-textile-stocks-jump-up-to-5-here-s-why-13528556.html,"The shares of export-oriented shrimp feed and textile companies rose on September 8, buoyed by multiple factors. This comes following strong volatility after Donald Trump-led US administration increased tariffs on Indian imports to a whopping 50 percent. Pearl Global Industries shares surged more than 5 percent to trade at Rs 1,268 apiece, while KPR Mill shares gained around 2 percent. Gokaldas Exports shares jumped nearly 4 percent, while Vardhman Textiles shares were up over 1 percent. Avanti Feeds shares jumped more than 2 percent, while Apex Frozen Foods shares were up around 1 percent. Coastal Corp shares gained nearly 3 percent, while Waterbase shares were up more than 2 percent. Here are the likely triggers for the uptick in the share prices. Trump softens stance on India: United States President Donald Trump recently described India-US ties as a ""very special relationship"", adding that he would ""always be friends"" with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. ""I will always be friends with (Narendra) Modi… He is a great prime minister. He is great. But I just don't like what he is doing at this particular moment. But India and the United States have a special relationship. There is nothing to worry about. We just have moments on occasion,"" Trump said in the Oval Office on September 5. Speaking on the massive tariffs imposed on India, Trump said, ""We put a very big tariff on India- 50 per cent, a very high tariff. I get along very well with (PM) Modi, as you know. He was here a couple of months ago, in fact, we went to the Rose Garden and had a press conference."" PM Narendra Modi on September 6 said he deeply appreciated and fully reciprocated US President Donald Trump's positive assessment of India-US ties. Modi stressed that the two countries share a very positive and forward-looking Comprehensive and Global Strategic Partnership. The exchange came days after Modi met Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Tianjin. Following the meet, Trump wrote that the US had ""lost Russia and India to deepest, darkest China"". FM Sitharaman promises support: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the Centre is preparing a relief package to help exporters bear the impact of the steep 50 percent tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump. ""We cannot leave our exporters high and dry saying the situation will change sooner, we will work with them,"" Sitharaman said in in an interview to Network 18 Group Editor-In-Chief Rahul Joshi on September 5. She added that the package, awaiting Cabinet approval, will support industries hit hardest by the duties, as suddenly finding new markets is challenging. Indian exporters to lobby RBI for weaker rupee to offset US tariffs: Several Indian exporters are set to request RBI to allow them to temporarily convert proceeds from their US business at a rupee rate that is 15 percent lower than current levels, Bloomberg reported. This will help cushion some of the impact from the US tariffs. The businesses will make their case to RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra at a meeting next week, the report cited Engineering Export Promotion Council of India Chairman Pankaj Chadha as saying. They are facing a loss of about 30 percent in US-bound shipments because of the higher tariffs, and they want the government to shoulder at least half of the burden, he added.

These gases are integral to essential systems and applications across industries such as steel, pharmaceuticals, healthcare, engineering, defense, energy, and food & beverages, supporting recurring demand and fostering long-term customer relationships.

Its differentiated CPCU (cost per converted user) model directly aligns revenues with advertiser ROI, offering resilience versus impression-led peers. Over the medium term, we believe Affle could sustain ~20% revenue CAGR, supported by rising CPCU realisations, international expansion, and scaling of new verticals such as CTV.

Again, you have to look at it on a YOY basis. We should see upwards of 20% growth, maybe even higher than that,"" Amit Kalyani added."
