Click to View More Outlook for August 18 Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities Nifty witnessed a lackluster trading session, remaining range-bound ahead of the Trump–Putin meeting on Friday. The overall sentiment is likely to favour bullish trades as long as the index holds above 24,337. On the higher side, resistance is placed at 24,660 and 24,850, while a fall below 24,337 could trigger a resumption of the bearish trend. Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets traded lackluster on the weekly expiry day and ended almost unchanged. After a flat start, the Nifty oscillated within a narrow range before finally settling at 24,631.30 level. Meanwhile, a mixed trend across sectors kept participants engaged, with IT, financials, and banking ending in the green, while metal, energy, and realty were among the top losers. However, the recent decline resumed in the broader indices after a short-lived bounce, with both the midcap and smallcap indices losing nearly half a percent each. The prevailing consolidation suggests that markets have largely digested recent negatives and are now awaiting a trigger for recovery. Additionally, oversold positions in heavyweights across sectors are further supporting this possibility. Going forward, a decisive break above 24,800 on the Nifty could spark fresh momentum; otherwise, consolidation may persist. Participants should maintain a stock-specific trading approach with a focus on risk management.

Adjusted for 24x7 losses and ESOPs cost (~Rs1.2bn), EBITDA was Rs9.7bn, up 18% YoY. The recent stake sale in HealthCo to Advent and merger with Keimed are a positive step and will lead to an integrated pharmacy distribution business complemented by the fastgrowing omni-channel digital health business. Scale-up in Apollo HealthCo has been on track with likely breakeven in EBITDA of digital business over the next 3-4 quarters. The management guidance of Rs20bn EBITDA of the merged entity by FY28 provides comfort. Further, mgmt. has also announced the demerger of its Omnichannel Pharmacy business, 24*7, and telehealth business into a newly listed entity (NewCo) with an aim to unlock value by creating a focused, high-growth platform in the pharmacy and digital healthcare space, which is more consumer centric in nature. Outlook Overall, we estimate 27% EBITDA CAGR over FY25-27E. We maintain ‘BUY’ rating with revised TP of Rs9.300/share.

EBITDA of Rs186.6bn (-2% QoQ) was in-line with our estimate of 187.6bn & consensus of Rs182bn. Lower DDA/write-offs of Rs80bn vs Rs111bn in the previous quarter was partially countered by lower other income of Rs12.1bn (Ple Rs26.7bn) vs Rs20.7bn in Q4, but still resulted in PBT rising by 23% QoQ to Rs107.4bn (PLe Rs107bn). PAT stood at Rs80.2bn, +24% QoQ (PLe Rs95.9bn, consensus Rs82.9bn). Going ahead, we build in 4-5% volume growth in oil and gas production in FY26E.

We believe FY26 margins to remain flat amidst higher store addition and investmetn behind growth.

Mutual funds are pushing for non-disclosure of block deals as Sebi reviews framework,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/mutual-funds-are-pushing-for-non-disclosure-of-block-deals-as-sebi-reviews-framework-13456287.html,"Should the names of parties involved in block deals be made public? The question came up during a review of the block deal framework by a Sebi-appointed working group, where mutual fund representatives pushed for change, arguing that the disclosure does not serve any significant purpose, and may even be detrimental for liquidity in that scrip. One fund manager suggested to the working group, “If an investor’s allocation across schemes results in a stake of less than 0.50% of a company’s total issued capital, the requirement to publicly disclose their name in block deal data should be done away with.” Another fund manager said disclosing names in block deals can hurt market liquidity. “Often, once names are disclosed, other market participants follow the trade trend, which impacts both the price and supply of the scrip. In many cases, the intended transaction cannot be completed in a single block deal, and multiple deals are required. But once the news is out, the price moves, derailing the strategy.” One of the fund managers pointed out that institutional investors often have investment timelines and strategies entirely different from retail investors, and said, “These small, scheme-level transactions rarely carry significant influence over the company but still require the same level of disclosure, adding to compliance burdens without much benefit.” Also Read: Inside stock market’s VIP lounge: How Sebi plans to stop the gatecrashers However, some market participants disagree. Arun Kejriwal, Founder of Kejriwal Research and Investment Services said Sebi should not entertain such suggestions. “The block deal disclosure framework has existed for many years, it has worked well, and it should continue for the sake of transparency,” said Arun Kejriwal. The BSE Brokers Forum (BBF), an association part of the working group to review block deal framework also voiced strong reservations. BBF argued that the block deal window comes with privileges – like negotiated pricing and reduced market impact - that justify greater transparency. “The public dissemination of data serves the larger interest of the market,” said one BBF representative, adding, “If participants are uncomfortable with having their names in the public domain, they can always trade in the normal market instead of using the block window.” The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has yet to decide on these suggestions and is reviewing the block deal framework. The working group has proposed several changes, reported earlier by Moneycontrol, including expanding the price band to 5 percent for the morning window and 3 percent for the afternoon window. Another suggestion is to increase the minimum deal size threshold to Rs 25 crore from current Rs 10 crore. The rationale for higher block size is that benchmark indices have grown nearly 2.7 times over the last 10 years, and with the growth in size and depth of the market, it is natural to raise the current limit, which was set in 2017. There is also a view that raising the block size limit would ensure participation from serious institutional investors, and not high-net worth individuals or family offices, who bypass the main market via block deals. Another suggestion to the working group was the need for a unified reference price for both windows. Currently, the morning window’s reference price (8:45–9:00 am) is based on the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) of the last half hour of the previous trading session, while the afternoon window’s reference price (2:05–2:20 pm) is based on the VWAP of trades executed between 1:45 pm and 2:00 pm. Block deals are primarily used by institutional investors such as mutual funds and insurance companies to execute large trades without significantly disturbing market prices. These pre-negotiated deals are executed in specific trading windows under strict rules to prevent price manipulation."

NIM decline was arrested at 10bps QoQ (even lower adjusted for IT refund); SBI expects a healthy pull back in H2FY26. CA growth surged further YoY. Despite subdued growth in Xpress credit, overall RAM growth sustained at ~14% YoY led by SME/home loans at 19%/15% YoY. Fee growth was strong at 10% YoY which, along with treasury gains, led to a healthy RoA print of 1.14%. Net NPA was stable at 47bps. Seasonality drove slippages higher QoQ, but improved YoY. We bake in the recent INR 250bn capital raise. We revise our FY26E/27E EPS upwards by 5-6% each and expect strong RoA of 1% for both years. Outlook Retain BUY; TP revised to INR 970. We argue that treasury gains for SBI appear recurring and less risky. Despite sluggish growth in Xpress credit, SBI has delivered superior growth in overall retail loans suggesting improved execution.

EBITDA margin declined to 9% (vs. 21.4% in Q1FY25 and 23.6% in Q4FY25), primarily attributed to negative EBITDA margin at Trac, which we believe is transient. Going forward, increasing capacities to 6,000+ tonnes by Dec’25/Jan’26, timely ramp-up and backward integration into titanium should drive revenues and margins.

The index has now snapped a three-day gaining streak. The shares had seen a sharp rally over the past three sessions, buoyed by weaker dollar and increased expectations of a rate cut by the US Federal Reserve, along with strong Q1 earnings announcement. NMDC shares were the top loser on the index, dropping more than 3 percent to trade at Rs 69 apiece. This comes a day after the stock jumped up to 3 percent after the release of its results. The company reported a marginal rise in net profit to Rs 1,968 crore and 24.5 percent on-year rise in revenue from operations to Rs 6,739 crore in Q1 FY26. Jindal Steel & Power shares dropped more than 2 percent to trade at Rs 971 apiece.

The company's revenue from operations meanwhile rose 13 percent on-year to Rs 64,232 crore in Q1 FY26 as compared to Rs 57,013 crore in Q1 FY25.

""Being in a growth phase, the company’s high valuation and current losses could lead to short-term volatility in returns.

Buy Varun Beverages; target of Rs 630: Anand Rathi,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-varun-beverages-target-of-rs-630-anand-rathi-13455512.html,"Anand Rathi's research report on Varun Beverages Revenue from operations net of excise and GST stood at the level of Rs. 70,174 million in Q2 CY2025, down 2.5% YoY. For H1 CY25, revenue grew by 9.3% to Rs. 125,843 million. The decline in Q2 was primarily due to a 3% drop in consolidated sales volume, which stood at 389 million cases. In India, volumes were impacted by abnormally high and unseasonal rainfall all through the quarter, resulting in a 7.1% decline in India. However, this was partially offset by healthy growth in international markets where volumes grew 15.1% led by a growth of 16.1% in South Africa. Net realization per case at the consolidated level improved marginally by 0.% supported by a favorable mix in the international markets per case realization recorded a 6.6% increase. CSD accounted for 75% of the total volumes in Q2 CY25 with packaged drinking water contributing 18% and NCB making up the remaining 7%. EBITDA remained flat at Rs. 19,988 million from Rs. 19,912 million in Q2 CY24. EBITDA margin improving by 82 basis points YoY to 28.5% in Q2 CY25, driven by operational efficiencies and a strong currency in international operations. PAT grew by 5% to the level of Rs. 13,255 million as compared to Rs 12,618 million in Q2 CY24, supported by improved operational efficiencies and lower finance costs. Outlook We expect VBL to see strong growth going forward due to many factors such as: 1) Strategic investment in enhancing production capabilities and making new acquisitions which have significantly strengthened their global presence 2) Increasing its presence in the domestic market and looking for exports opportunities. We maintain BUY rating on the stock with a target price of ₹ 630 per share.

Speaking to CNBC-TV18 on August 14 following the June quarter results, George Alexander Muthoot, Managing Director of Muthoot Finance said, ""We had said 15 percent but we will better it. We don't want to change right now, but it will be better than 15 percent. Let us not limit to 20 percent, it could be even better, we will discuss in the next quarter,"" Muthoot said, when asked the view on loan growth guidance. Read More: Muthoot Finance shares hit 10% upper circuit on Q1 beat: Should you buy, sell, or hold? The NBFC cited three key factors behind the strong quarterly show, which are, a healthy demand for gold loans, strong momentum in gold prices, and recent lending guidelines by RBI that were seen as business friendly by the industry. George Alexander Muthoot said the final guidelines gave a boost to the gold loan business, conveying a message that the Finance Ministry and the RBI is keen to support the gold loan business, as it serves the community well. The lender said the worst for the gold loan business may be behind and all players have started lending responsibly. Muthoot Finance added that it is facing no issues in accessing capital from banks. The demand has been healthy as gold loan borrowers have had limited access to unsecured loans, Muthoot added. The NBFC said it will aim to maintain the spread at 9.5 percent, and will pass on the benefits of lower borrowing rates to customers as banks start cutting MCLR. Jefferies has maintained a Buy call on Muthoot Finance, raising target to Rs 2,950 per share. The NBFC's June quarter profit growth was stronger than expected, and credit cost along with NPAs fell compared to March quarter. The note added that strong growth in gold prices and the headroom to further raise its LTV should support healthy loan growth for Muthoot Finance. Morgan Stanley has upgraded the stock to Overweight with a target price of Rs 2,920 per share, backed by strong ROE and EPS growth, along with an negligible asset quality risk, even amid the risk of rising bad loans at the group level, the note added.

Even so, Voltas maintains its leadership in the RAC segment. Takeaways: (1) The company refrained from price cuts/discounting for market share gains. (2) Softer demand for RAC led to lower capacity utilisation at its Chennai plant, impacting margins. (3) Voltas Beko (VoltBek) continued to gain market share aided by operational efficiencies, multi-channel traction and improved retail visibility. (4) The company continues to expand its non-seasonal portfolio to reduce seasonality risk. We believe, the company could benefit from NPD (AI-enabled series in RAC), cost discipline and the upcoming festive demand; however, elevated summer inventory in the channels may cap rest of FY26. We downgrade the stock as we model relatively weaker FY26. Outlook We trim our FY26–27E earnings estimate by 7.0%–14.7% to factor in the weak Q1FY26 results.

The newly-listed stock has now fallen nearly 18 percent from its record high level in just three sessions. After opening flat, NSDL shares dropped nearly 4 percent to hit an intraday low of Rs 1,161 apiece. Yesterday, the stock dropped more than 6 percent to close at Rs 1,206 apiece. This came after the company released its results for the April-June quarter of the financial year 2026. NSDL on August 12 reported a net profit of Rs 89.63 crore for the first quarter of the financial year 2026. This marks a rise of more than 15 percent on-year from the Rs 77.82 crore reported by the newly-listed company for the same quarter last year. While the firm saw a rise in its bottom line, its expenses dropped more than 14 percent on-year to Rs 228 crore in April-June quarter of the ongoing financial year. The firm's revenue from operations however dropped 7.5 percent on-year to Rs 312 crore in Q1 FY26. Its revenue from operations stood at Rs 337 crore in Q1 FY25. Sequentially, it fell more than 14 percent from the Rs 364 crore revenue reported in Q4 FY25. NSDL shares had made a decent stock market debut on August 6, listing at 10 percent premium to IPO price at Rs 880 apiece on BSE. Analysts had advised investors to consider holding the stock for the long term, given NSDL’s strong fundamentals and leadership in the depository segment. The Rs 4,000-crore IPO had turned out to be a multi-bagger for some of India’s top financial institutions. The shares of the company rallied as much as 62 percent from its listing price, and over 78 percent from its IPO price during the sharp rally, to hit an all-time high level of Rs 1,425 per share in just four sessions.

""Post Q1FY26 result, NSDL's stock price experienced a notable correction following an exceptional initial rally after its IPO. Net profit rose 15.1% YoY to ₹90 crore, however, revenue fell 7.5% YoY to ₹312 crore and over 14% sequentially, likely due to softer capital market activity. NSDL trades at a premium PE ratio of around 72, compared to peers like CDSL at about 66, sustaining this premium will depend on consistent revenue growth in the coming quarters. For long-term investors, NSDL’s dominant position, high switching costs, and regulatory tailwinds support the story, but near-term topline softness needs monitoring,"" said Ajit Mishra, SVP, Research, Religare Broking Ltd. ""Long-term investors can take comfort in the fact that India's capital market infrastructure fundamentals remain robust, which indirectly optimizes real estate sentiment as liquidity confidence gets bolstered...Non-allotted investors can consider buying on dips with a horizon of 2–3 years. The listing confirms the wider demand for reliable, regulated market participants – and a welcome boost for allied industries such as housing finance and commercial property,"" said Siddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director, Vibhavangal Anukulakara Private Limited. NSDL’s current P/E ratio currently stands at around 71.5, significantly higher than the 49 P/E ratio recorded during its debut. Its peer CDSL currently has a P/E ratio of around 66. The valuation may appear to be stretched when compared to that of CDSL, investors are clearly willing to pay a premium for NSDL’s scale, technology backbone, and long-standing trust within the ecosystem, said Bhavik Joshi, Business Head at INVasset PMS. ""That said, prospective investors should be mindful of certain structural risks — dependence on transaction volumes, evolving investor participation patterns, and the ever-present cybersecurity and regulatory compliance requirements. In the near term, valuations may moderate if market activity slows, offering potential entry points for those who missed the IPO,” Joshi added. Also read: NSDL shares see volatility after rally; what lies ahead? Nitin Jain, Senior Research Analyst at Bonanza, said it is recommended for short-term and listing-gain-focused investors to book some profits. ""The near-term upside may be capped after such a sharp move, and markets tend to see consolidation post a robust debut. If you are a long-term investor willing to ride out near-term volatility, NSDL remains a high-quality stock supported by rising demat penetration,"" he added. Market expert Ambareesh Baliga told CNBC-TV18 that it will be ideal for IPO investors to book profits at current levels and make a shift back to CDSL. ""At the IPO price, NSDL was definitely cheaper compared to CSDL but now it is expensive after the recent run-up. I think along with long investors shifting from CDSL to NSDL post listing, we have seen huge number of momentum trader getting in, which has pushed the stock higher,"" he said. Sunny Agarwal of SBI Securities also told the news channel that investors focused on short-term gains should book profits after the record rally, while long term investors should consider accumulating more shares using any dip.

Deepak Nitrite shares slide 5% after weak Q1; stock down 28% so far this year,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/deepak-nitrite-shares-slide-5-after-weak-q1-stock-down-28-so-far-this-year-13455135.html,"Shares of Deepak Nitrite fell five percent to Rs 1,785 on August 14 after the company’s June quarter (Q1FY26) earnings fell short of market expectations. The weak performance weighed on sentiment, extending the stock’s downtrend this year. So far this year, this chemical stock has tumbled over 28 percent, underperforming benchmark Nifty 50's 2 percent rise. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog For the quarter ended June 30, 2025, Deepak Nitrite posted a 44.6 percent year-on-year decline in net profit to Rs 112 crore, compared with Rs 202.5 crore in the same period last year. Revenue came in at Rs 1,889.8 crore, down 12.8 percent from Rs 2,166.8 crore in the year-ago quarter, reflecting soft demand and pricing pressure in several product segments. Operating performance took a sharper hit, with EBITDA slipping 38.8 percent year-on-year to Rs 189.3 crore from Rs 309.4 crore in Q1FY25. The EBITDA margin contracted to 10 percent from 14.3 percent last year, as higher input costs and lower realisations eroded profitability. Deepak Nitrite faced pressure across both its core business divisions during the quarter. In the Advanced Intermediates segment, revenue fell 15 percent to Rs 605.33 crore, while EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) tumbled 47 percent to Rs 35.47 crore. In the Phenolics segment, revenue declined 11 percent to Rs 1,303.96 crore, with EBIT sliding 43 percent to Rs 117.90 crore. Despite the current challenges, Deepak Nitrite remains optimistic about its future prospects, saying multiple projects are underway, including capacity expansion, securing stable input supplies, and driving both backward and forward integration.

It expects the delivery segment to outperform in the near term and sees value offerings along with product innovation driving order growth in FY26. Standalone pre-IND AS EBITDA margin is projected at 12–14 percent for FY26–28E. MOSL added that rich valuations support its decision to keep the rating at Neutral. The broader context shows that urban Indian consumers are tightening their belts amid rising living costs, weighing on same-store sales for budget retailers like Trent and quick-service restaurant chains such as Pizza Hut operators Sapphire India and Devyani International. Jubilant FoodWorks, however, has stood out as an exception, delivering double-digit like-for-like sales growth for at least three consecutive quarters. For the quarter ended June, Domino’s India – operated by Jubilant – posted an 11.6 percent growth in like-for-like sales, led by a strong 20.1 percent surge in the delivery segment. In contrast, Sapphire India saw an eight percent drop in Pizza Hut’s same-store sales, while Devyani International reported a 4.2 percent decline.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Mahindra and Mahindra, NMDC Steel, Eternal, MCX India, Indian Hotels, and others on August 14?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-mahindra-and-mahindra-nmdc-steel-eternal-mcx-india-indian-hotels-and-others-on-august-14-13454436.html,"Equity benchmark indices recouped all of their Tuesday's losses, with the Nifty 50 gaining half a percent on August 13, as market breadth turned in favour of the bulls. A total of 1,560 shares advanced compared to 1,149 declining shares on the NSE. Range-bound trading is likely to be seen in the market in the upcoming sessions. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities NMDC Steel | CMP: Rs 43.02 NMDC Steel has given a spectacular breakout from its prolonged downward consolidation, clearly indicating a bullish price reversal after more than halving from Rs 73 to a low of Rs 32. Moreover, the stock has closed above the 200 EMA for the first time since August 2024. The RSI displayed a hidden positive divergence, further adding to the recent positivity around the stock. On the higher side, it may move towards Rs 48–50, while support on the lower side is placed at Rs 40. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 50 Stop-Loss: Rs 40 Eternal | CMP: Rs 312.35 Eternal has given a downward consolidation breakout on the daily chart, indicating increased bullishness. Moreover, it has been sustaining above the critical moving average. Additionally, the RSI is in a bullish crossover. The sentiment is likely to remain positive in the short term, with potential upside towards Rs 333, while a stop-loss is placed at Rs 303. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 333 Stop-Loss: Rs 303 TVS Motor Company | CMP: Rs 3,019.2 TVS Motor Company has given a flag pattern breakout on the daily chart, indicating a resumption of the uptrend following a brief corrective phase. Moreover, it has been sustaining above the critical moving average. Additionally, the RSI is in a bullish crossover. The sentiment is likely to remain positive in the short term, with potential upside towards Rs 3,350, while a stop-loss is placed at Rs 2,900. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,350 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,900 Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical Research and Derivatives at SBI Securities. Mahindra and Mahindra | CMP: Rs 3,282.2 M&M has recently demonstrated notable technical strength by establishing a solid base near its 50-day EMA, a key support level that often acts as a springboard for bullish moves. During this consolidation phase, the stock has formed an Adam & Adam Double Bottom pattern on the daily chart. On Wednesday, the stock decisively broke above the neckline of this pattern, confirming the breakout on a daily scale. All major moving averages are aligned positively, and momentum indicators are echoing strength. The daily RSI has surged past the 60 mark and continues to trend upward, indicating increasing bullish momentum and suggesting that the stock may be entering a fresh leg of rally. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 3,290-3,270 levels. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,510 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,180 Multi Commodity Exchange of India | CMP: Rs 8,339 After registering a high of Rs 9,115 on July 1, MCX entered a phase of healthy correction. The correction was accompanied by below-average volume activity, indicating that the decline was likely a routine correction following a sharp rally, rather than a sign of distribution or weakness. The correction found support near the 50-day EMA, where the stock formed a strong base, suggesting accumulation at lower levels. The stock has formed a strong base near the support zone and witnessed a strong rebound. The reversal from the support zone is confirmed by relatively higher volume. The daily RSI has also rebounded from lower levels and is about to surge above the 60 mark. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 8,350-8,300 levels. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 8,900 Stop-Loss: Rs 8,070 Indian Hotels Company | CMP: Rs 769.8 Indian Hotels is currently poised for a breakout from a Symmetrical Triangle pattern on the daily chart. On Wednesday, the stock witnessed a notable surge in volume. This uptick in volume suggests accumulation and growing investor interest ahead of a potential breakout. Technically, the stock is trading above both its short-term and long-term moving averages. What adds further strength to the setup is the behaviour of the daily RSI, which has climbed above the 60 mark for the first time since April 2025, signaling a revival in bullish momentum. Overall, the combination of pattern formation, volume expansion, and improving momentum indicators points toward a likely breakout, provided the stock sustains above key resistance levels. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 775-765 levels.Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 830 Stop-Loss: Rs 745 Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Click to View More Outlook for August 14 Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The Nifty remained strong throughout the day after initial hours of uncertainty, closing at a multi-day high and signaling improved sentiment amid tariff-related concerns. The daily RSI has recently entered a positive crossover and continues to hold this momentum after several days of indecision. With sentiment showing signs of improvement, the likelihood of the Nifty moving above the 24,700 resistance has increased. A decisive move above this level could trigger a rally towards 25,200 in the short term. On the lower side, support is placed at 24,337, below which the dynamics would once again turn in favor of the bears. Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities After showing weakness from the hurdle of 24700 levels on Tuesday, Nifty shifted into a sustainable upside amidst range bound movement on Wednesday and closed the day higher by 131 points. Nifty opened on a positive note and continued with gradual upside for better part of the session. The overhead resistance of 24700 remains intact and the market closed below it. A small positive candle was formed on the daily chart with upper and lower shadow. Technically, this market action indicates gradual upmove in the market with lack of strong momentum.

Immediate support is placed at 24465 levels. Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities After the volatile activity of the last 4 days, the market took a breather today. Nifty closed 130 points higher, while Sensex gained 300 points. Across sectors, intraday buying was seen in pharma, healthcare and Defense stocks, while select PSU banks and FMCG stocks witnessed profit booking at higher levels. Technically, after an initial intraday corrective trend, the market reached 24660/80700 levels; however, it failed to sustain that level and closed marginally above the opening levels. The activity is indicating indecisiveness; however, the positive thing is that it closed above the 10-day EMA, which could pull the market towards the 20-day SMA, which is at 24800/81200. Support is present at 24500/80300, below which it could gradually decline to 24400/80000 or 24350/79800 levels. It is advised to trade as per the given levels.

However, commissioning has been deferred to Q3 FY26 (from Q1 FY26 earlier) due to monsoon, logistical, and operational challenges. Geopolitical and tariff-related uncertainties could weigh on exports to the parent company. Rising low-cost imports, particularly from China, threaten domestic performance.
