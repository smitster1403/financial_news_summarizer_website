"Voltas shares slump 8% after Q1 results miss Street estimates, brokerages remain cautious",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/voltas-shares-slump-8-after-q1-results-miss-street-estimates-brokerages-remain-cautious-13434384.html,"Shares of Voltas fell 8 percent to Rs 1,202 per share on August 11 after its June-quarter (Q1FY26) results missed Street expectations. So far in 2025, the stock has fallen 33 percent, underperforming the Nifty 50 index’s 2 percent gain. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog CLSA maintained a “hold” rating but cut its target price to Rs 1,170 per share, citing a 20 percent year-on-year drop in revenue and a 400 basis point fall in EBITDA margin. The Unitary Cooling Products (UCP) segment’s revenue fell 25 percent year-on-year, with margins plunging to a 10-year low of 3.6 percent. Market share dropped to 17.8 percent from 19.5 percent. CLSA expects recovery from Q3 onwards but sees flat to a 10 percent decline in full-year industry growth, with high inventories continuing to weigh on utilisation and margins. Nomura retained its “neutral” rating with a target price of Rs 1,317 per share. It said Q1FY26 UCP margins missed sharply and warned that competitive intensity may keep margins under pressure despite recovery hopes. The brokerage cut its FY26 revenue growth forecast for room air conditioners to 5 percent, while keeping FY27 and FY28 estimates at 20 percent and 15 percent respectively. It also lowered UCP revenue growth forecasts to 6 percent for FY26 and 24 percent for FY27. In Q1FY26, Voltas’ net profit slumped 58 percent year-on-year to Rs 140.6 crore from Rs 334 crore in the same quarter last year, as unseasonal weather and muted summer demand hit cooling product sales. Revenue fell 20 percent to Rs 3,938.6 crore, while EBITDA halved to Rs 178.6 crore. Operating margins contracted to 4.5 percent from 8.6 percent a year earlier. Management attributed the weak performance to a delayed summer and early monsoon, which dented air-conditioner sales. A high base from last year—when prolonged heat waves boosted record demand—further amplified the decline.

Manappuram Finance shares fall 3% as brokerages turn cautious on dismal Q1 results,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/manappuram-finance-shares-fall-3-as-brokerages-turn-cautious-on-dismal-q1-results-13433991.html,"Shares of Manappuram Finance fell 3 percent to Rs 251 apiece on August 11 after the company reported weak June quarter (Q1FY26) results. Brokerages stayed in a wait-and-watch mode, with management indicating that the worst phase is over and profitability is expected to return by the fourth quarter of FY26. Jefferies maintained a “hold” call but raised its target price to Rs 275 per share. It said Q1 profit after tax was in line with estimates as weaker net interest income (NII) was offset by lower provisions in the microfinance (MFI) segment. Gold loans grew 12 percent quarter-on-quarter, mainly due to higher prices. However, customer growth was muted despite yield cuts. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog The brokerage noted that lower NIMs, unwinding of non-gold loans, and elevated MFI provisions will weigh on earnings. While valuations appear reasonable, Jefferies said more clarity on the turnaround under the new CEO is crucial for a re-rating. CLSA retained its “outperform” rating with a target price of Rs 260 per share. It said Q1FY26 pre-provision operating profit (PPoP) and net profit missed estimates by 9 percent due to sharper-than-expected declines in yields and spreads. Management has trimmed lending rates across high-ticket loans and plans further cuts to around 18 percent over the next four to six quarters. Loan growth of 13 percent quarter-on-quarter was driven entirely by higher ticket sizes, while the Asirvad MFI business saw a 23 percent sequential decline in its loan book. CLSA echoed management’s view that the worst is behind and profitability should return by Q4FY26. In Q1FY26, Manappuram Finance’s net profit fell 75 percent year-on-year to Rs 138 crore from Rs 555 crore in the same quarter last year. Revenue from operations declined 9 percent to Rs 2,262 crore. The gold loan segment saw a 10 percent year-on-year rise in revenue to Rs 1,904 crore, but the microfinance segment posted a steep 53 percent drop to Rs 361 crore.

On the other hand, UBS adopted a more cautious stance with a “neutral” rating and a target price of Rs 880 per share, noting that business growth was modest and the loan-to-deposit ratio moderated by 70 basis points quarter-on-quarter. Bernstein also maintained a “market perform” rating, with a target price of Rs 800 per share. The brokerage said loan and deposit growth of 12 percent came at the expense of a sharper margin drop, adding that core profitability remains weak, though non-interest income gains and recoveries helped sustain RoA. In Q1, SBI’s net profit rose 12 percent to Rs 19,160 crore from Rs 17,035 crore a year ago, driven by strong treasury gains and retail loan growth. The quarter saw significant gains from the sale of government securities, supported by policy rate cuts totaling 75 basis points, along with higher foreign exchange trading income. The NIM fell to 3.02 percent from 3.35 percent a year earlier, reflecting lower returns on domestic advances while deposit costs stayed high. At the end of FY25, NIM stood at 3.22 percent for the country’s largest lender, which accounts for nearly one-fifth of all outstanding bank credit in India.

"Asian stocks edge up before key data, oil falls",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/asian-stocks-edge-up-before-key-data-oil-falls-13431994.html,"Asian shares posted a modest gain at the open as investors stayed cautious ahead of key economic data this week and a looming deadline for the potential extension of US tariffs on Chinese exports. Stocks rose in Australia while South Korea fluctuated. Oil fell 0.7%, the seventh decline in eight days, ahead of US-Russia talks. There will be no cash trading in Treasuries during Asian hours due to a holiday in Japan. Gold futures in New York steadied as traders awaited clarification from the White House over its tariff policy. Contracts for the S&P 500 edged up 0.1%. Asian lithium stocks rose after Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. suspended production at a major mine in China’s Jiangxi province for at least three months, a move that may ease oversupply concerns. The modest moves came as traders awaited critical US economic releases that could shape interest-rate expectations, while a looming tariff deadline may influence trading sentiment. A key focus will be the US inflation report, expected to offer further insight into the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate path amid concerns the economy is teetering on the edge of stagflation. “Stagflation creates a dilemma for the Federal Reserve as it challenges their dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability,” Joe Unwin, head of portfolio management at Apostle Funds Management, wrote in a note. “This could lead to a scenario where interest rates remain elevated despite weaker economic growth, which would be bearish for almost all traditional asset classes.” Oil fell after its biggest weekly drop since end-June before a meeting between the US and Russian leaders on Friday, which is raising the prospect of an end to the war in Ukraine and more supply. Brent traded near $66 a barrel, after sliding 4.4% last week, while West Texas Intermediate was above $63. Technology stocks will be in focus after Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. agreed to pay 15% of their revenues from chip sales to China to the US government as part of a deal with the Trump administration to secure export licenses. Chinese retail sales and industrial production data due later this week will be parsed after consumer and producer price data at the weekend indicated demand remains fragile. Traders are also waiting for confirmation that the Aug. 12 deadline for talks on US duties on Chinese imports will be extended. “The market has fully subscribed to the high probability of the tariff truce being rolled over for another 90 days,” said Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone Group in Melbourne. Elsewhere, Australia’s central bank is expected to ease policy on Tuesday as inflationary pressures ebb. Still, Governor Michele Bullock is expected to stick with her cautious stance on the monetary policy outlook."
"Nearly 750 stocks crash over 50% from 52-week highs; small caps bear maximum brunt, financials, infra lead losses",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/nearly-750-stocks-crash-over-50-from-52-week-highs-small-caps-bear-maximum-brunt-financials-infra-lead-losses-13431892.html,"Nearly 750 stocks -- 743 to be precise -- led by small caps and financials, have dropped over 50% from their respective 52-week highs even as benchmark indices remain mostly stable, despite global market concerns. Data from Ace Equity shows that small caps make up more than four-fifths of these declines, highlighting sector-wide pressure from muted earnings, tariff concerns and stretched valuations. Of the nearly 4,000 listed companies, data shows that all companies have seen a decline from their highs, out of which 743 are down more than 50 percent. Further, of the 743 companies, more than 82 percent or 614 entities are small caps. Mid-caps account for 95 companies, while 34 large-cap stocks, typically considered safer bets, have also shed more than half their value. Biggest individual losersKesoram Industries recorded the steepest fall, collapsing 97.8% from Rs 235.95 to Rs 5.12 amid debt issues and weakening fundamentals. Spright Agro dropped 95.8% from Rs 44.66 to Rs 1.87, while Vantage Knowledge Academy and AGS Transact Technologies fell 95.7% and 95.6%, respectively. Other companies such as Bharat Global Developers, Mercury Trade Links, Sunshine Capital, Sadhana Nitro Chem, AF Enterprises, Money Masters Leasing & Finance, and K&R Rail Engineering also lost over 90% of their market value. Even some large and well-known names have suffered losses (of less than 10 percent) from the 52-week high. PB Fintech, operator of Policy bazaar, and Gland Pharma have both fallen more than 8%. According to Sunny Agrawal, Head of Fundamental Research at SBI Securities “The Indian equity market, post scaling new life highs in September 2024, witnessed correction due to slower earnings growth from a government capex slowdown, relatively expensive valuations compared to MSCI EM indices, and a globally uncertain environment post the election of Mr Trump. Some madcaps and small caps have seen steep correction due to a combination of weak earnings and froth in valuations.” Financials and infra lead the fallThe financial services sector tops the list with 132 stocks down more than 50%, including AGS Transact, AME Fin trade India and Aretha Finest, which saw declines of 85–95% on regulatory pressures and funding constraints. Industrial and infrastructure names follow closely, with 121 companies in the red. Udayshivakumar Infra, a recent IPO, has plunged over 90%, while VRC Construction and Bharat Global Developers have been dragged down by project delays and weak balance sheets. IT and digital services (79 stocks) have seen post-pandemic valuation corrections. Consumer and retail (64) have been weighed down by weak demand and higher costs, hitting Add-Shop E-Retail, SM Gold and Karim India. Pharma and healthcare (49) have suffered from price erosion and slowing overseas demand, dragging down Gland Pharma, Laurus Labs and Marksans Pharma. Real estate and construction (58) saw DB Realty, Ajmera Realty and Godrej Properties drop 55–70% on high debt and muted launches. Education and training (22) posted some of the steepest losses, with Vantage Knowledge Academy and CL Educate down over 90%. Agriculture and FMCG (39) were hurt by commodity volatility, while 27 media and entertainment stocks also fell more than 50%. Analysts flag multiple pressure pointsShrikant Chouhan, Executive Vice President and Head of Equity Research at Kotak Securities, said the sell-off is driven by “a confluence of weak earnings, trade tensions, and valuation resets.” He pointed to India’s looming 50% tariff risk on exports to the US affecting 70% of outbound shipments and the rupee at 88 as factors hitting sentiment. “With most uncertainties now known, Q2 could show improvement, and our strategy should be bought on dips,” he added. Narendra Solanki, Head of Fundamental Research at Anand Rathi Stock Brokers believes that part of the correction reflects a necessary rebound after post-Covid valuation exuberance. “Many stocks saw significant run-up post-Covid due to high growth and macro tailwinds. Liquidity-driven optimism pushed valuations too high, making them susceptible,” he said, adding that diminished global liquidity and FII outflows are intensifying the downturn. Market watchers are closely tracking ingenious support levels at 23,700 and 24,000, with resistance seen at 25,000–25,500. Analysts believe domestic institutional inflows could help cushion further declines, and that any positive surprises in Q2 earnings or policy announcements might trigger a rebound.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Sanghvi Movers, Kajaria Ceramics, TVS Motor, Tech Mahindra, Medanta, Pidilite Industries, and others on August 11?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-sanghvi-movers-kajaria-ceramics-tvs-motor-tech-mahindra-medanta-pidilite-industries-and-others-on-august-11-13431749.html,"The benchmark saw a nearly 1 percent correction on August 8, after a day of sharp intraday recovery. Bears maintained their dominance over the market breadth, with about 1,808 shares declining compared to 877 rising shares on the NSE. The market may attempt a bounce back after six weeks of consistent losses, but sustainability will be the key to watch. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Rajesh Palviya, Senior Vice President Research (Head Technical Derivatives) at Axis Securities Sanghvi Movers | CMP: Rs 307.7 Sanghvi Movers registered 17.5% gains last week. With this strong buying momentum, the stock has experienced a trend reversal, as it has decisively broken out past a one-and-a-half-year ""down-sloping trendline resistance"" at Rs 292 on a weekly closing basis. Huge volumes on this breakout signify increased participation. The stock is well placed above its 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-day SMAs, which reconfirms a bullish trend. These averages are also inching up along with the price rise, further reinforcing bullish sentiment. The daily, weekly, and monthly strength indicator RSI indicates rising strength. The daily ""Bollinger Bands"" buy signal signifies increased momentum. Investors should consider buying, holding, and accumulating this stock. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 350, Rs 385 Stop-Loss: Rs 280 Kajaria Ceramics | CMP: Rs 1,308.5 Kajaria Ceramics, with the past couple of sessions' up-move, has decisively surpassed the ""multiple resistance"" zone of Rs 1,267 on a closing basis, indicating a strong comeback by bulls. Over the past couple of months, rising volumes have signified increased participation. The stock is well placed above its 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-day SMAs, reaffirming a bullish trend. These averages are also inching up along with the price rise, reinforcing bullish sentiment. The daily, weekly, and monthly strength indicator RSI indicates rising strength. The daily ""Bollinger Bands"" buy signal signifies increased momentum. Investors should consider buying, holding, and accumulating this stock. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,420, Rs 1,500 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,267 TVS Motor Company | CMP: Rs 2,968.9 TVS Motor Company, with last week's price action, has confirmed a ""Cup and Handle"" formation breakout at Rs 2,965 on a closing basis. The past couple of weeks' rising volumes show increased participation. The stock is well placed above its 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-day SMAs, reaffirming a bullish trend. These averages are also inching up along with the price rise, reinforcing bullish sentiment. The daily ""Bollinger Bands"" buy signal signifies increased momentum. Investors should consider buying, holding, and accumulating this stock. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,100, Rs 3,250 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,880 Rajesh Bhosale, Technical Analyst at Angel One Tech Mahindra | CMP: Rs 1,480.4 From the April swing low near Rs 1,180 to the June peak around Rs 1,700, Tech Mahindra saw a strong rally, followed by a month-long price correction. This week, after testing the 50% retracement level of that advance, prices staged a solid rebound, forming a bullish engulfing pattern on the weekly chart. The formation of this pattern at a key support zone signals a potential resumption of the uptrend. Notably, this support aligns with the 89-WEMA, further reinforcing the bullish outlook. On the momentum side, the RSI Smoothened has generated a fresh buy signal from the oversold territory, lending additional confirmation to the positive view. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,600 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,420 Indian Bank | CMP: Rs 650.85 Despite weakness in the broader banking space over the past couple of months, Indian Bank has stood out with notable relative strength, consistently holding above its multi-month bullish breakout zone. This week, while the overall market came under pressure, the stock gained over 4%, breaking out of consolidation and confirming a Flag pattern on the weekly chart — a classic continuation signal in an uptrend. On the momentum front, monthly and weekly RSI readings remain firmly above 80, underscoring strong bullish sentiment, while a pullback in the daily RSI toward 40 offers an attractive buy-on-dips opportunity. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 710 Stop-Loss: Rs 619 Anshul Jain, Head of Research at Lakshmishree Investments Global Health (Medanta) | CMP: Rs 1,423.2 Medanta has broken out of a 282-day-long rounding pattern with a massive volume surge — over 1,334% above the 50-day average — signaling strong institutional participation. The breakout coincides with stellar quarterly results, featuring 50% EPS growth year-on-year and sales rising over 20%. Moving averages and momentum indicators are bullishly aligned, providing additional support for further upside. This blend of powerful price action, extraordinary volumes, and strong fundamentals points to a potential sharp follow-through rally, offering an attractive setup for momentum traders aiming to capitalize on institutional buying and sustained market strength. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,650 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,300 Pidilite Industries | CMP: Rs 3,081.3 Pidilite, after a failed breakdown of its box pattern with boundaries at Rs 2,900–3,110, has rebounded sharply to test the box high. It is now consolidating near this upper boundary, forming an inside bar — a sign of controlled price action before a possible breakout. The reversal from the box low created a bear trap, adding strength to the structure. A decisive move above Rs 3,120 will confirm the breakout and likely accelerate momentum toward the Rs 3,400 zone. The price setup, coupled with the failure of bears to hold breakdown levels, signals strong underlying buying interest and bullish continuation potential. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,400 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,980 Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

OTM butterfly for slow market: Shubham Agarwal,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/expert-columns/otm-butterfly-for-slow-market-shubham-agarwal-13420465.html,"Butterfly is one of the most celebrated strategies after the margin benefits were introduced. Butterfly strategy is a strategy adopted by many option sellers. However, little credit has been given to Butterfly by Option buyers who are more interested in directional moves. Before we go into its use, let us understand what the Butterfly strategy is. Butterfly is a strategy that involves selling 2 options close to the current market price of the stock or index and buying a higher strike price option and a lower strike price option. A butterfly made with all calls is called a Call Butterfly, and with all Puts is called a Put Butterfly. The favourite of option sellers is selling both Call and Put of strike close to the current market price and buying a Higher strike Call and a Lower strike Put. This is called Iron Butterfly. For directional trades, we will restrict ourselves to Call and Put Butterfly, and we will go OTM. OTM or Out of the Money options are higher strike Call options and lower strike Put options. They are called OTM because if the stock had to expire exactly at the current price, these options would not make any money. Now, let us look at the slow-moving market to understand how OTM Butterflies can help. A slow-moving market, especially in the first half of the monthly expiry, is very difficult for a directional option trader. Especially when the premiums are too expensive due to a lot of time-related value in them. The first problem is cost. Second problem with these expensive options early in the expiry is that if it takes 2 weeks for the stock to move, the premium reduction due to passage of time is so severe that there is very little profit left for the trader despite the right call on direction. On the other hand, if we are towards the end of the expiry, the premiums are less expensive, but the loss due to the passage of time is very fast. In either case, the problem still remains of not being able to wait longer in the trade. Both are critical problems to be dealt with. Both of them can be cleared by a Call/Put Butterfly depending on the direction. Example of an OTM Call Butterfly Let us say you are bullish on a stock trading at 1000 with a target of 1040 1010 Call @ 13 1040 Call @ 5 1070 Call @ 2 Now, the choice is to buy 1010 Call at 13 and sit on it. 1040 comes after 20 days, and with 2-3 days to expiry, the Option trades around 30. Profit of 17. Or we create a Butterfly with Buy 1010, Sell 2 1040, and Buy 1070 Call. Ne Premium out is 5. Maximum profit = Diff between Buy and Sell strike (1040-1010 = 30) – Net Premium Paid (5) = 25. Here, if we go wrong, we lose 5 vs losing 13 in the Call bought.

More than 40 small-cap stocks drop 10-24% amid tariff concerns,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/more-than-40-small-cap-stocks-drop-10-24-amid-tariff-concerns-13429906.html,"The broader indices underperformed the main indices and continued the fall in the third consecutive week, led by volatility amid better auto numbers, mixed earnings, and persistent FII selling after the US imposed additional tariffs on India. For the week, BSE Large-cap and Mid-cap indices shed 1 percent each, and the BSE Small-cap index slipped nearly 2 percent. For the week, the BSE Sensex index shed 742.12 points or 0.92 percent to finish at 79,857.79, while Nifty50 shed 202.05 points or 0.82 percent to end at 24,363.30. The Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) extended their selling in their sixth consecutive week, as they sold equities worth Rs 10,652.47 crore, despite remaining buyers in the final day of the week. On the other hand, Domestic Institutional Investors (DII) extended their buying in the 16th week, as they purchased equities worth Rs 33,608.66 crore. In this month on August so far, FII sold equities worth Rs 14,018.87 crore and DII bought equities worth Rs 36,795.52 crore. On the sectoral, Nifty Pharma, Realty, FMCG, Healthcare, lost 2 percent each, while PSU Bank, media, and metal rose 0.5-1.5 percent. ""Since July, the Indian equity market has remained in a phase of consolidation, reflecting weakening investor sentiment due to trade-aligned challenges. Concerns over steep US tariff rates and underwhelming quarterly earnings have dampened market confidence. Persistent selling by FIIs, particularly in pharma stocks with significant US exposure, underscores this cautious outlook. The continued depreciation of the INR has also added to investor anxiety,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments. ""Despite these headwinds, downside risks were partially cushioned by RBI’s reaffirmation of macroeconomic stability, its optimistic stance on domestic growth, and early signs of easing inflation. Looking ahead, market volatility is expected to persist. While risks from US trade tensions and sustained FII outflows remain, potential support from DIIs could offer some relief."" ""Upcoming inflation data from both India and the US will be critical in shaping investor expectations. Market participants are advised to closely track global trade developments and corporate earnings, with a strategic focus on domestic consumption-driven sectors that are better positioned to withstand short-term volatility,"" he added. The BSE Small-cap index slipped nearly 2 percent with PG Electroplast, Kitex Garments, Unichem Laboratories, Morepen Laboratories, Advait Energy Transitions, KR Rail Engineering, Faze Three, and Advanced Enzyme Technologies falling between 15-24 percent. However, Sarda Energy and Minerals, Timex Group India, Sanghvi Movers, Zinka Logistics Solutions, Centum Electronics, KRBL, Baazar Style Retail, Godfrey Phillips India, and Entertainment Network India gained between 12-21 percent. Where is Nifty50 headed? Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Lingering uncertainty over the tariff situation, coupled with continued selling by FIIs, has been weighing on market sentiment. The medium-term moving average—the 100-day EMA—near the 24,600 mark, which earlier acted as support, is now serving as an immediate resistance. A close below 24,450 signals the continuation of the corrective phase, with a potential retest of the long-term moving average—the 200-day EMA—near 24,200. Traders are advised to align their positions accordingly, with greater emphasis on risk management."" Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The Nifty moved southward as it failed to sustain above the 50 EMA on the hourly chart, indicating prevailing selling pressure. Moreover, the index closed below the crucial support level of 24,400, highlighting the strength of the bears. Sentiment was already tilted in favour of the bears, with the index forming a lower-top, lower-bottom pattern. The short-term trend remains weak, with potential downside towards 24,150–24,200. On the higher side, resistance is seen at 24,475–24,500. Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities After witnessing a sustainable bounce back from the lows on Thursday, Nifty witnessed sharp selloff on Friday. A long bear candle was formed on the daily chart that completely negated the bullish sentiment created on Thursday. A long negative candle has been formed on the weekly chart which is for the sixth consecutive week on the trot. The formation of long upper shadows in the last 4-5 weekly candles signals sell on every rise in the market. The underlying trend of Nifty continues to be weak. The next lower levels to be watched around 24200-24000 by next week. However, any pullback up to the hurdle of 24500 could be a sell on rise opportunity.

Management said ICE margins have been under stress for some time, with an additional blow from commodity inflation in the June quarter, driven mainly by higher steel prices, safeguard duty of 12 percent and forex risks.

In contrast, the EV business has been showing a steady improvement in profitability. Tata Motors said EV margins have been rising year-on-year even without battery localisation incentives, helped by significant cost cuts.

Tata Motors races to secure rare earth magnet supply amid global risks,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/tata-motors-races-to-secure-rare-earth-magnet-supply-amid-global-risks-13425916.html,"Tata Motors is taking no chances with its electric vehicle supply chain, as rare earth magnets—vital for EV motors—emerge as a potential global choke point. While production remains unaffected for now, the company is already working on alternatives to secure future supplies. Group CFO P.B. Balaji, speaking on the Q1 FY26 earnings call, said the company is evaluating all options: ""Redesigning, including lighter ones, including different sources, including different substitutes being put in place."" Also read: FPIs have been sanguine about Indian markets: NSE CEO on market reaction to Trump tariffs The push comes amid rising global concern over China’s dominance in rare earth supplies, which could spark shortages or price spikes in the event of geopolitical tension. Tata Motors, along with its UK-based unit Jaguar Land Rover, is preparing to respond with a multi-pronged strategy—ranging from supplier diversification to component redesign. Domestically, the company said it is covered for the next 2-3 months, and it is looking at alternatives outside of China. Balaji pointed out that past experiences have shaped this proactive stance. ""The learnings coming from the semiconductor crisis have meant that we have been off the blocks quite fast. And that has helped us cope with this quite well, both here (at Tata Motors) and in JLR. And that is what we are executing.” For now, there is no change to Tata Motors’ production or launch plans, but the company isn’t waiting for disruptions to materialise. Apart from this, Jaguar Land Rover is staring at a roadblock in China after the government cut the luxury tax threshold from 1.3 million RMB (Chinese yuan) to 900,000 RMB, pulling almost all Range Rover sales into the tax net and adding an extra 10 percent levy in a market where retail finance remains tight.

Recent trade agreements have eased the blow from an initially proposed 1,000 percent hike, but duties will still rise sharply — about 300 percent for vehicles built in the UK and 500 percent for those from Europe. These tariffs directly raise the landed cost of JLR’s cars in the US, potentially squeezing margins and limiting pricing flexibility. A planned 15 percent reduction in these rates is yet to take effect, meaning elevated costs will persist in one of its most important overseas markets.

Losses were broad-based, with autos, metals, IT and pharma leading the decline. At close, the Sensex was down 765.47 points or 0.95 percent at 79,857.79, and the Nifty was down 232.85 points or 0.95 percent at 24,363.30. About 1494 shares advanced, 2380 shares declined, and 137 shares were unchanged. Also read: SBI Q1 results: Net profit rises 12% to Rs 19,160 crore, beats estimates Stretched valuations in Indian equities are prompting persistent selling by foreign investors, who have been net sellers on every trading day so far in August, offloading a total of Rs 15,950 crore in the cash market. Thursday’s sharp 250-point rebound in the Nifty from its intraday low was largely driven by short covering, sparked by strong domestic institutional investor (DII) purchases worth Rs 10,864 crore. With market sentiment weighed down by tariff tensions between India and the US, FIIs are expected to keep trimming their cash market exposure. However, robust DII inflows, backed by steady mutual fund investments, are helping cushion the market and could prevent a deeper sell-off, V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments Ltd, said. Sectoral indices on the NSE were largely in the red, with realty (-1.93%), metal (-1.71%), consumer durables (-1.64%), and midcaps (-1.49%) seeing the sharpest losses. Auto, pharma, infrastructure, private banks, and IT stocks also weighed on sentiment, while PSU banks and media ended only marginally lower. The Nifty Bank fell 0.78 percent, while FMCG and energy slipped 0.72 percent and 0.53 percent, respectively. Oil & gas was the sole gainer, inching up 0.06 percent. Volatility picked up, with India VIX rising 2.05 percent to 11.93. Among individual stocks, Coforge slipped 6 percent to Rs 1,605 in the afternoon on August 8, sinking for the third time in four sessions and wiping over 10 percent in just four days, after key client Sabre Corp plunged 35 percent on the Nasdaq overnight following a lacklustre quarterly report.

With this move, the stock has now risen 67 percent from its IPO price in just three trading sessions. Tata Motors slipped over a percent, marking its third straight day of losses, as investors turned cautious ahead of the automaker’s Q1 results later today, with analysts bracing for a sharp decline in profit and revenue. According to a Moneycontrol poll of six brokerage firms, the Nexon maker is anticipated to record an 8.7 percent year-on-year decrease in revenue, reaching Rs 98,600 crore. Technical View ""Immediate support lies at 24,450, aligning with a previous demand zone. Unless breached decisively, any dip is likely to attract fresh buying interest. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart hovers around 40 but has started showing a positive divergence, hinting at easing bearish momentum. Intraday indicators also signal a reversal from oversold territory. The overall structure remains oversold, suggesting that any pullbacks may offer opportunities to initiate fresh long positions as optimism gradually returns,"" Dhupesh Dhameja of SAMCO Securities said. Titan Company, NTPC, HDFC Life, Dr Reddy's Laboratories, and Coal India were the top gainers on the Nifty. Laggards on the Nifty included Adani Enterprises, Bharti Airtel, Shriram Finance, IndusInd Bank, and Hindalco.

Growth was led by textile & apparel, though garmenting faced headwinds due to uncertainty around the US tariffs. EBITDA grew 29% YoY, though 35% below our estimate as margins got impacted by higher marketing spends and scale deleverage in garmenting. Managementis confident of a margin recovery in 2H. Although the overall demand environment remains challenging, there are signs of improvement, with stronger momentum in order bookings. Post a sharp correction (down 46% YTD), its valuation appears attractive at ~19x FY27E PE or ~1x FY27 EV/sales. However, we believe improvement in execution and sustained growth recovery remain key for re-rating. We cut our FY26-27E EPS by ~11-14% due to weaker margins and the impact of the US tariff-related uncertainty in the garmenting segment. We build in ~9% revenue CAGR over FY25-28E, with margins expanding to 12.3% by FY28. Outlook We value RLL at 22x Sep’27E P/E to arrive at our revised TP of INR1,425.

Biocon gears up to ride weight-loss drug boom to script next growth chapter,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/biocon-gears-up-to-ride-weight-loss-drug-boom-to-script-next-growth-chapter-13423370.html,"Biocon is betting big on GLP-1 therapies and peptides to drive its next wave of growth, as global demand for weight-loss and diabetes treatments accelerates. The company is preparing for a day-one launch of semaglutide in select markets, with filings underway and approvals expected by late 2026 or early 2027, managing director and chief executive officer Siddharth Mittal told Moneycontrol. He was referring to the expiry of semaglutide patent in India and several other countries in 2026, which will pave the way for its generic versions. The Bengaluru-based drugmaker is also looking to fill the void left by multinational players as they pivot away from insulin to GLP-1 therapies, backed by expanded capacity in Malaysia and new approvals in the US, Europe and other markets. “We are the only other large insulin manufacturer with expanded capacity,” Mittal said in an interview. “We think we are very well placed to benefit from this refocus of innovators from insulin to GLP.” Biocon’s insulin manufacturing capacity expansion in Malaysia is expected to come online by the end of this fiscal, he said. The company is doubling the capacity to capture market share in geographies where multinational companies such as Novo Nordisk are exiting the insulin segment, particularly in human insulin. Biocon recently secured USFDA approval for Kirsty, its interchangeable biosimilar insulin aspart, and is preparing for a “meaningful launch” in the fiscal fourth quarter, aligned with contracting cycles. The company also received approval for liraglutide, which is used in treating type 2 diabetes, in India and Europe, with launches underway through commercialisation partners. Peptides and GLP-1s: The next frontier Biocon is building a robust pipeline of peptides targeting weight loss, diabetes, and dermatology. “We were the first company in the world to get generic liraglutide approved in an ICH market (like the UK, Europe and Canada),” Mittal said. Globally, the GLP-1 segment is booming, with liraglutide alone generating over $1.6 billion in annual sales. Biocon’s peptide capabilities are expected to play a pivotal role in capturing this opportunity. Its generics business is seeing traction from launches like lenalidomide, dasatinib in the US and liraglutide in the European Union. The company is also advancing approvals for rivaroxaban and everolimus in the US. “Pricing pressure is stable at 5–7 percent, but product-level dynamics vary,” Mittal said. Rivaroxaban is used to treat deep vein thrombosis. Everolimus is an immunosuppressant used to prevent rejection of organ transplants and also in the treatment of renal cell cancer and other tumours. In biosimilars, Biocon has launched Yesafili in Canada and received European approvals for denosumab. Its oncology portfolio continues to lead in the US, with Fulphila and Ogivri holding 27 percent market share each. Tariff preparedness While pharma remains exempt from US tariffs for now, Biocon is de-risking its supply chain. “We’ve got two facilities in the US, expanded oral solid dosage capacity in New Jersey, and local partnerships like Civica Rx for insulin manufacturing,” Mittal said. “We’re scenario-mapping but there’s a limit to how much we can do.” With a strong start to FY26, Biocon expects double-digit growth across biosimilars, generics, and CRDMO. The company raised Rs 4,500 crore through QIP, which has strengthened its balance sheet. The funds will be used to increase its stake in Biocon Biologics. “We’re aligning our business with shifting global policy and supply chain dynamics,” Mittal said. “The next few years will be about scaling what we’ve built and leading in the segments that matter.”"

Net jewelry store additions stood at 19 in 1Q, bringing the total count to 1,110. Standalone jewelry LFL growth was 11%, and CaratLane posted a robust 39% YoY growth.

This will result in a sequential recovery in margins to 12% by 4QFY26 (normalized levels), fueled by operating leverage and absence of inventory losses.

Weak earnings by some of the key players, profit booking and lack of fresh triggers fuelled the downturn in the sector. The defence index dropped to 7,662, as seen at 2 pm. The index has now extended losses for the third consecutive session. Defence shares came in focus after the Indian military in May conducted targeted strikes against terrorist outfits in Pakistan and Pakistan occupied Kashmir under the codename 'Operation Sindoor'. As the geopolitical tensions between India and Pakistan eased, the escalating wars between Russia-Ukraine and Israel - Iran further boosted the stocks. Additionally, NATO members agreed to a big increase in their defence spending target, which fuelled the bullish sentiment further. The Nifty India Defence index jumped a whopping 42 percent since 2024 closing to hit a record high in June. However, as geopolitical tensions around the globe continue to ease, the defence stocks declined. Analysts flagged elevated valuations, despite the positive sentiment around the stocks. Data Patterns shares dropped nearly 6 percent to trade at Rs 2,426 apiece. The company on August 7 reported a 22 percent YoY and 75 percent QoQ drop in net profit to Rs 25.5 crore for Q1 FY26. Its revenue from operations meanwhile tumbled around 75 percent sequentially to Rs 99 crore during the quarter under review. Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders shares declined nearly 5 percent to trade at Rs 2,657 apiece. The company on July 28 reported a net profit of Rs 452 crore for the first quarter of the financial year 2026. This marks a decline of around 35 percent on-year from the Rs 696 crore net profit reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year. DCX India, Paras Defence and Bharat Dynamics (BDL) shares dropped up to 4 percent each, while Solar Industries, Cochin Shipyard and Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) shares fell more than 2 percent each. Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers (GRSE), BEML and Bharat Electronics (BEL) shares were trading in the red with marginal losses. GRSE on August 8 reported a net profit of Rs 120 crore for Q1 FY26. This marks a 38 percent on-year rise from the Rs 87 crore net profit reported in Q1 FY25. However, net profit nearly halved sequentially from the Rs 244 crore reported in Q4 FY25. ""Indian defence stocks have entered a consolidation phase after a strong rally earlier this year...recent price action suggests a cooling-off period. Some institutional investors have begun booking profits, especially in stocks that had run up sharply. Valuations, in certain cases, had moved well ahead of fundamentals, prompting a tactical pullback...The sector’s trajectory from here is likely to be more measured—balancing near-term volatility with medium-term promise. Selectivity and disciplined entry points will be critical as defence transforms from a thematic play into a core allocation theme over the coming years,"" said Bhavik Joshi, Business Head, INVasset PMS.

"Metal, realty stocks down up to 5 percent as Trump tariffs weigh: Here are the top losers",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/metal-realty-stocks-down-up-to-5-percent-as-trump-tariffs-weigh-here-are-the-top-losers-13422712.html,"The shares of metal and real estate companies were under selling pressure on August 8, tracking the weakness in overall market after US President's tariff decision. The Nifty Metal index was down nearly 2 percent, while Nifty Realty index was down over a percent, extending losses for a fourth session. US President Trump on August 6 doubled tariffs on India to a whopping 50 percent, the highest among its Asian peers. He cited India’s Russian oil imports as a key reason for the tariff hike. While metals have been excluded from the latest tariff hike, the already existing steep duties continue to put pressure on the stocks. Global pricing and demand pressures could further influence the sector's performance. Meanwhile, the Rupee has strengthened against the US dollar, after it opened 15 paise higher on August 8, overlooking Trump’s comments ruling out trade talks with India. As rupee strengthens against dollar, it becomes more expensive for foreign buyers to purchase metal from Indian companies, thus putting further pressure on shares. Real estate companies derive majority of their revenue from domestic market, however, rising metal prices as a result of the tariffs could increase input costs, which in turn may affect their margins. Property stocks have further declined after RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra announced the MPC’s decision to keep repo rate unchanged at 5.5 percent. The repo rate directly influence home loan interest rates, affecting EMIs and loan costs, hence, a rate pause may dampen sentiment. Weak earnings by some of the key players too has put pressure on the shares. Jindal Stainless Steel was the top loser on the Nifty Metal index, dropping nearly 5 percent, Adani Enterprises shares fell more than 3 percent, while JSW Steel and Jindal Steel & Power shares fell nearly 2 percent each. Hindustan Copper and SAIL shares were down over a percent each. Vedanta, National Aluminium Company (NALCO) and Tata Steel shares were down nearly a percent while APL Apollo Tubes, NMDC and Hind Zinc shares were in the red with marginal losses. Sobha and Godrej Properties shares were the top losers on the Nifty Realty index, dropping nearly 3 percent each. Phoenix Mills and Oberoi Realty shares fell nearly 2 percent each, while Prestige Estates, Anant Raj and Raymond shares dropped more than 1 percent each. Macrotech Developers (Lodha), DLF and Brigade Enterprises shares were down up to 1 percent.

Buy Hero MotoCorp; target of Rs 5304: LKP Research,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-hero-motocorp-target-of-rs-5304-lkp-research-13422904.html,"LKP Research's research report on Hero MotoCorp Hero MotoCorp reported muted performance in Q1FY26, with revenue at ₹95.8 bn, declining 5.6% YoY and 3.6% QoQ, primarily impacted by (1) a temporary production pause, (2) seasonality in the Parts, Accessories, and Merchandise segment, which weighed on ASPs, and (3) broader industry headwinds. The company implemented price hikes related to OBD compliance, phased across Q4FY25 and Q1FY26. While commodity costs rose ~0.5% QoQ, management remains confident in offsetting the impact through its ongoing LEAP cost-saving program, which continues to deliver meaningful gains. EBITDA margin stood at 14.4%, largely flat YoY, supported by gross margin expansion driven by a favorable product mix, pricing actions, and disciplined cost management. However, this was partially offset by negative operating leverage due to lower volumes. PBT came in at ₹14.9 bn, stable YoY, with PBT margin improving to 15.5% (up 80bps YoY / 101bps QoQ), aided by higher other income. We expect EBITDA margins to remain in the 14.5%-15% range in FY26E-27E, supported by a favourable product mix and ongoing cost optimization measures, including gains from the LEAP program. Outlook We expect Revenue/EBITDA/PBT to grow at a CAGR of 8.1%/ 10.8%/ 9.7% over FY25–FY27E, with favourable product mix, operating leverage, and EV ramp-up serving as key catalysts. We value company at a P/E of 19x on earnings of FY27E and raise our target to ₹5,304.

Coforge shares slide 6% after major client’s weak quarterly results rattle investors,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/coforge-shares-slide-6-after-major-client-s-weak-quarterly-results-rattle-investors-13422363.html,"Shares of Coforge slipped 6 percent to Rs 1,605 in the afternoon on August 8, sinking for the third time in four sessions and wiping over 10 percent in just four days, after key client Sabre Corp plunged 35 percent on the Nasdaq overnight following a lacklustre quarterly report. Sabre’s revenue and EBITDA for the current quarter came in below earlier projections, prompting the travel technology firm to sharply scale back its full-year outlook. Growth in Air Distribution Volumes is now expected at just 4–10 percent, compared to its previous double-digit forecast. Revenue guidance was cut to flat-to-low single-digit growth from high single digits earlier, while adjusted pro forma EBITDA guidance was lowered to $530–570 million from $630 million. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Under a 13-year agreement, Coforge is a key partner for Sabre, tasked with bolstering product delivery and building AI-powered solutions. The midcap IT firm posted an 8 percent growth in revenue in constant currency terms for the June quarter. The performance also sharply contrasted with Persistent Systems and LTIMindtree, which reported CC growth of 3.3 percent and 0.8 percent, respectively. A key growth driver this quarter was the ramp-up of Coforge’s $1.6 billion contract with Sabre, which powered a 31 percent sequential surge in its travel, transportation, and hospitality vertical. This helped offset weakness in its BFSI segment, where banking revenue slipped 1.1 percent and insurance saw a modest 1 percent uptick in US dollar terms. The company’s rupee revenue rose 8.6 percent sequentially to Rs 3,687 crore. On the margin front, EBITDA improved by 60 basis points to 17.5 percent, while EBIT margin held steady at 13.2 percent. Coforge secured new deals worth $507 million during the quarter. While this is significantly lower than the $2.1 billion haul in the previous quarter, the earlier number included the mega Sabre deal. Importantly, the executable order book for the next 12 months now stands at $1.54 billion—up 3 percent sequentially and a robust 44 percent year-on-year. At about 1:40 am, shares of the company were trading at Rs 1,614, lower by 5.2 percent from the last close on the NSE. Coforge shares are down over 16 percent since the beginning of the year.

EBITDA increased by ~24% YoY/QoQ to INR4.0b (~11% miss), and EBITDA/t increased ~32% YoY to INR966 (est. INR995). PAT increased ~142% YoY to INR860m (~27% below our estimates). The management indicated cement sales volume declined ~7% YoY due to weak demand led by the early monsoon in Kerala and eastern markets. While the construction chemical business posted a strong growth of 79% YoY, albeit on a low base. It reiterated the capacity target of 30mtpa to be achieved by Mar’26 with the commissioning of line-2 and debottlenecking of existing capacity at the Kurnool plant and adding grinding capacities in existing plants with nominal capex. TRCL has monetized INR5.0b so far, through sales of non-core assets out of the targeted INR10.0b. The balance is likely to be monetized before Sep’25 vs. earlier expectations of by Jul’25, a slight delay due to pending approvals. Outlook The stock is currently trading at 17x/15x FY26E/FY27E EV/EBITDA (vs. its long-term average of 15x) and USD140/USD120 EV/t (vs. long-term average of USD130).

SUN TV acquired a 100% stake in Yorkshire-based The Hundred franchise “Northern Superchargers” for GBP100m.

Notably, upcoming introductions such as g-Entresto have the potential to further strengthen growth in the US generics segment. That said, a broader scope of business would be necessary to enhance capacity utilization and, in turn, improve the profitability of the US generics segment.

Continued execution challenges in the Power segment led to 5.6% YoY decline in revenue despite a strong power order book of ~Rs1.6trn.

This came after the company reported a 103 percent on-year surge in net profit to Rs 539 crore for the April-June quarter of the financial year 2026. The stock exchange released its results for Q1 FY26 in the post market hours of August 8. While net profit more than doubled on an annual basis, it grew 9 percent sequentially from the Rs 494 crore reported in the previous quarter. Revenue from operations meanwhile increased 59 percent on-year and 13 percent sequentially to Rs 958 crore in Q1 FY26. BSE's EBITDA rose 105% to Rs 704 crore in Q1FY26 as compared to Rs 344 crore a year ago. Should you buy, sell or hold? Motilal Oswal Financial Services kept a 'neutral' rating on the stock, but increased its target price to Rs 2,600 apiece. This implies an upside potential of nearly 6.5 percent from the stock’s previous closing price of Rs 2,442 apiece. The domestic brokerage said that the firm’s Q1 net profit beat its estimates by 13 percent, driven by lower-than-expected clearing house expenses. Motilal Oswal increased its earnings estimates for BSE by 7 percent each for FY26 and FY27, in order to adjust for lower clearing house costs and income from colocation. It however kept the ‘neutral’ rating, anticipating a market share loss from the shift in expiry from September 2025 and uncertainty over future regulatory actions. ""We expect BSE to lose 300-400bp of premium turnover market share once the weekly expiry shifts to Thursday from Tuesday currently. Any further regulatory moves to curb retail activity in F&O can impact volumes for the exchange,"" it said.

The international brokerage said that the firm’s Q1 profit was in line with estimate, buy revenue growth missed expectations slightly, according to CNBC-TV18. Jefferies trimmed its EPS estimates by 5-6 percent, to account for lower options activity. Goldman Sachs maintained a 'Neutral' rating on the stock, with a price target of Rs 2,550 per share.

VIP IN reported weak set of results with topline declining 12.1% YoY to Rs5,614mn (PLe Rs6,325mn) as volumes were down by 8% amid weak growth in e-com channel. Adjusting for inventory provision of ~Rs150mn and one-off expense of ~Rs110mn, EBITDA margin stood at 9.0% (PLe 9.8%). We believe FY26E will be a year of cost reset and reorganization for VIP IN amid change of guard at top-level.

Tata Motors extends losing streak to third day ahead of Q1 earnings,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/tata-motors-extends-losing-streak-to-third-day-ahead-of-q1-earnings-13421965.html,"Shares of Tata Motors slipped over a percent to Rs 639, marking its third straight day of losses, as investors turned cautious ahead of the automaker’s Q1 results later today, with analysts bracing for a sharp decline in profit and revenue. According to a Moneycontrol poll of six brokerage firms, the Nexon maker is anticipated to record an 8.7 percent year-on-year decrease in revenue, reaching Rs 98,600 crore. Net profit is projected to witness a massive plunge of about 33.5 percent to Rs 3,672 crore from Rs 5,523 crore in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates The domestic revenue is expected to take a hit due to a sharp 6 percent decrease in volumes and a flat average selling price year-on-year. The company sold 85,206 vehicles during the quarter, lower than the 91,209 units sold in the same quarter of the previous year. The company’s British arm, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), is expected to report a 12 percent year-on-year decline in volumes for the first quarter of FY26, excluding the China joint venture. The drop is largely attributed to subdued demand in the US market, where the imposition of Trump-era tariffs has dampened buyer sentiment. Consolidated margins are expected to decline year-on-year by about 390 basis points. This decline will likely be driven by a combination of factors: negative operating leverage due to lower volumes, increased tariff-related costs on US sales, and adverse foreign exchange impact arising from the appreciation of the British pound against the US dollar. Also read: REITs push for bank loan access, cite parity with InvITs but govt split on proposal Investors will watch for updates on JLR’s FY26 guidance, progress on cost-control initiatives, demand and discounting trends in key markets, as well as volume and market-share trajectory. Clarity on the new-model launch schedule and the phase-out plan for Jaguar models will also be key. At about 12:10 pm, shares of the company were trading at Rs 741, lower by 0.75 percent from the last close on the NSE. Tata Motors' share price has slipped nearly 13 percent since the beginning of the year.

Unlisted shares of MSEI plunge as revival optimism fades away; price drops 65% since December,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/unlisted-shares-of-msei-plunge-as-revival-optimism-fades-away-price-drops-65-since-december-13421544.html,"Shares of Metropolitan Stock Exchange of India (MSEI) have seen a huge 65 percent fall in the current calendar year in the unlisted segment as optimism around its revival faded away with stricter rules put in place in the equity derivatives segment. Data from Unlisted Zone shows that the MSEI shares are currently hovering a little below Rs 5, plunging nearly 14 percent in the last 15 days. More importantly, the shares have dropped nearly 65 percent since December – falling from Rs 14 to the current levels. According to experts, the sentiments around MSEI turned bleak after the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) directed that only two days – Tuesday and Thursday – can be fixed as expiry days for the derivative contracts. This was after the regulator said that only one weekly expiry contracts would be allowed per exchange. This assumes significance as there was a lot of traction in the shares of MSEI when new norms were announced for the F&O segment. It was believed that MSEI would be able to launch a weekly expiry contract with an expiry day different from that of NSE or BSE, which would help the exchange attract significant trading volumes. However, the SEBI diktat on only two days permitted for expiry dashed investor sentiments. “The initial rally in MSEI’s share price was driven by investor optimism that the exchange would be allowed to launch weekly F&O contracts with an expiry date different from those of NSE and BSE. However, the recent SEBI regulation restricting this possibility dampened sentiment, leading to a correction in the stock,” says Umesh Paliwal, co-founder, Unlisted Zone. “Subsequently, news emerged about MSEI’s plans to raise additional capital and expand into new segments. While these developments signal growth intentions, the real test lies in the exchange’s ability to successfully roll out competitive products -- such as offerings in the cash market or bond market, and generate meaningful revenue. With the exchange space being intensely competitive, the coming 6–8 months will be crucial for MSEI. These uncertainties have collectively contributed to the recent decline in its share price,” adds Paliwal. Last month, the board of the exchange approved a decision to raise as much as Rs 1,000 crore and further said that the proposed allottees would include Peak XV Venture Partners Investments VII, Share India Securities, Trust Investment Advisors, Marwadi Chandarana Intermediaries Brokers, and Monarch Networth Capital among others. This was following an earlier board meeting in December when the exchange approved raising nearly Rs 240 crore from marquee names like Billionbrains Garage Ventures (promoter entity of Groww), and Rainmatter Investments (Kamath brothers of Zerodha), along with Securicorp Securities India, and Share India Securities. Meanwhile, in an emailed response, MSEI said that there is huge potential in this country for more than two stock exchanges to operate and survive as we are a growing economy. ""We are truly humbled and encouraged by the market’s positive response to our recent initiatives — including two successful rounds of fundraising and the growing interest from market participants.We shall soon be relaunching equity segment followed by other segments. Further, we will continue to introduce new initiatives, along with niche products and services to meet the evolving needs of the market,"" it said."
Buy Jyoti Resins and Adhesives; target of Rs 1764: CD Equisearch,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-jyoti-resins-and-adhesives-target-of-rs-1764-cd-equisearch-13421651.html,"CD Equisearch's research report on Jyoti Resins and Adhesives Jyoti Resins & Adhesives is one of the leading manufacturers of white glue adhesives in the Indian retail market. It operates in the brand name of ‘Euro 7000’ which it launched in 2006 and has currently presence in 14 Indian states. Increasing Government support through projects like ‘Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana’ under the scheme ‘Housing for All’ and projects related to promote smart cities have bolstered demand for woodworking in India in the past few years. Consumers’ inclination towards high quality and appealing wooden aesthetics have also helped accelerate growth in wood adhesives market. Rising demand for both commercial and residential projects (supported by growing urbanization) too has buoyed demand for wood adhesives.

Buy Anant Raj; target of Rs 800: Emkay Global Financial,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-anant-raj-target-of-rs-800-emkay-global-financial-13421648.html,"Emkay Global Financial' research report on Anant Raj We expect operations to start over the next 3-4 months, with annualized occupancy at ~70%, which would improve ahead. This would take the total operational DC capacity to 28MW (including 0.5MW of cloud capacity), from 6MW currently. Over the next two years, we expect DC capacity to increase to 63MW at a capex ~Rs19-20bn, which would largely be met through cash flow generated from the real estate business. The management expects DC business revenue of Rs12bn by FY27 and Rs90bn by FY32, at full occupancy. We have factored in gradual improvement in occupancy and, hence, expect DC business revenue to increase to Rs7bn in FY27E, from Rs455mn in FY25. Overall, we expect ~20% IRR for the DC business by FY45E. Accordingly, despite the delayed fundraising, expansion via internal accruals will keep the net debt low at Rs2.1bn till FY27E (currently Rs1.2bn), in our view. Outlook We reiterate BUY on Anant Raj, with an unchanged TP of Rs800. We visited the company’s new data center facilities in Panchkula (7MW capacity) and Manesar (21MW), in Haryana.

Buy Lupin; target of Rs 2500: Emkay Global Financial,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-lupin-target-of-rs-2500-emkay-global-financial-13421763.html,"Emkay Global Financial' research report on Lupin Lupin delivered yet another quarter of earnings outperformance vs street as well as our estimates, with the beat in 1QFY26 being driven by a higher gross margin. Gross margin as well as EBITDA margin were at multi-quarter highs, with the higher gross margins likely to sustain in 2Q+3Q on the back of exclusivity in gJynarque. 1Q performance reinforces our long-held view that FY26 margins for Lupin will be closer to 26%. We note that our FY27/28 US estimates already factor in incremental competition in gProAir (FY27) and gSpiriva (FY28) and, given Lupin’s/peers’ past as well as recent experiences with inhaler filings, Lupin’s core US profit pool could stay preserved for longer. In addition to the upbeat management commentary (the delay in gDulera launch being a minor negative), our continued positive stance stems from 1) our belief that gJynarque will remain a meaningful contributor to earnings well into FY27, 2) the company being in the middle of a balance sheet strengthening cycle, and 3) Lupin’s sustained R&D investments in complex generics which will continue to feed into its medium-term US pipeline. Besides, the company’s established domestic diabetes franchise benefiting from therapy-specific tailwinds and the likely elimination of margin drag from domestic adjacencies remain potential upside drivers. Outlook We marginally raise our earnings estimates and roll forward to Jun-27E EPS; retain BUY and TP of Rs2,500.

Reduce Britannia Industries; target of Rs 5500: Emkay Global Financial,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/reduce-britannia-industries-target-of-rs-5500-emkay-global-financial-2-13421634.html,"Emkay Global Financial' research report on Britannia Industries Q1 results were in line, adjusting for the Phantom Stock Option Scheme expenses. Under this scheme, employees are being incentivized with a Rs520mn payout, based on 19% stock price return. We believe this arrangement could weigh on near-term performance, as any stock price appreciation from strong execution will be rewarded back to the management, impacting reported financials. The management aims to offset the impact from next year. We find the recent actions to be accretive, ie: a) a sharper focus on health and indulgence through new launches; b) faster growth in Quick Commerce (now 3% of sales; 500bps higher market share), and c) healthy price hikes, along with expected RM stability. Our double-digit earnings growth forecast for FY26E remains intact, even after the 5% earnings cut. As the stock appears to be fairly valued, the employee cost impact from the scheme seems immaterial. Outlook We maintain REDUCE, lowering our Jun-26E TP by 6% to Rs5,500, based on 48x P/E (revised from 50x, now aligned with the 5Y average forward P/E).

Brokerages were quick to turn optimistic. CLSA maintained an “outperform” rating with a target price of Rs 4,394 per share, noting its confidence in management’s jewellery EBIT margin guidance of 11 to 11.5 percent for FY26. Jefferies retained a “buy” rating and lifted its target price to Rs 3,800 per share, citing robust growth in both jewellery and watches, along with healthy margin expansion in the June quarter. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog Prabhudas Lilladher also maintained its “buy” call, setting a target price of Rs 3,901 per share. The brokerage remains upbeat on the company’s long-term outlook, pointing to its efforts to enhance product mix, the strategic shift towards lightweight jewellery, and a strong medium-term growth runway led by innovative designs. Citi, however, struck a more cautious tone, assigning a “neutral” rating with a target price of Rs 3,900 per share. While acknowledging Titan’s near-term growth potential relative to other discretionary categories, the brokerage flagged medium-term margin risks from intense competition, high gold prices, and an unfavourable product mix. In Q1FY26, Titan’s consolidated net profit surged 52.5 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,091 crore, while revenue jumped 24.6 percent to Rs 16,523 crore. Operating profit (EBITDA) rose 46.7 percent to Rs 1,830 crore from Rs 1,247 crore a year earlier. EBITDA margin improved to 11.1 percent from 9.4 percent, surpassing expectations of 10.6 percent. The jewellery division, Titan’s biggest revenue generator, posted a 19 percent year-on-year growth (excluding bullion and digi-gold sales) despite persistently high gold prices. The watches and wearables segment logged one of its best quarters ever, with revenue up 24 percent to Rs 1,273 crore. The EyeCare business grew 13 percent year-on-year to Rs 238 crore, delivering an EBIT of Rs 20 crore with an 8.4 percent margin. Meanwhile, Titan Engineering & Automation reported a 56 percent jump in income to Rs 307 crore. Within this, Automation Solutions grew 82 percent, while Manufacturing Services expanded 16 percent, buoyed by strong demand from the aerospace sector.

Neutral Bajaj Auto; target of Rs 8561: LKP Research,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/neutral-bajaj-auto-target-of-rs-8561-lkp-research-13421305.html,"LKP Research's research report on Bajaj Auto Bajaj Auto (BAL) reported muted Q1FY26 results. Revenue came in at ₹120.8 bn, registering growth of 4.6% YoY and 3.3% QoQ. Domestic performance remained subdued, primarily due to (1) the early and intense onset of the monsoon, (2) elevated inflation in metro cities, (3) purchase deferments by customers, and (4) heightened competitive intensity. However, strong export performance helped offset the domestic weakness, with export volumes witnessing robust growth and premium bike sales reaching an all-time high in international markets. EBITDA margin stood at 19.7% in Q1FY26, down 53 bps YoY and 20 bps QoQ. The decline was driven by an unfavourable currency environment in key export geographies, rising commodity costs, and supply chain disruptions related to rare earth magnets. These challenges impacted production of the Chetak EV and EV 3Ws. The company reported PBT of ₹27.9 bn, with PBT margin improving by 37 bps YoY to 23%, supported by higher other income and lower finance costs. Looking ahead, we expect BAL to face near-term margin pressure due to intensifying competition in the +125cc segment and continued supply constraints stemming from the rare earth magnet shortage. Outlook We estimate revenue/EBITDA/PBT to grow at a CAGR of 9%/9%/8% over FY25–27E and value the stock at 25x FY27E EPS, arriving at a target price of ₹8,561.

Quarterly revenues have grown at a 27% CAGR over the last two years, supported by capacity expansion and global demand. Gross margin declined to 32.6% due to mix change and coffee price volatility, though gross profit still rose 17% YoY. Its EBITDA rose 22% YoY to ₹1.59 bn, but PAT was flat YoY and down 29% QoQ due to peak depreciation and interest costs, both expected to ease from Q3. Branded and domestic businesses remained strong, with 20% YoY growth and improved margins; management reaffirmed 10–20% volume and 15–20% EBITDA growth guidance for FY26. Net debt declined to ₹16.7 bn, with working capital likely to ease as coffee prices stabilize; depreciation and interest burden are expected to gradually reduce. Outlook We revise our rating to ‘NEUTRAL’ with a target price of ₹938, as near-term positives appear priced in; we estimate 22%/19%/22% CAGR in Revenue/EBITDA/PAT over FY24–27.

Kalyan Jewellers sharply lower by over 7 percent on heavy volumes despite strong Q1 earnings,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/kalyan-jewellers-sharply-lower-by-over-7-percent-on-heavy-volumes-despite-strong-q1-earnings-13421276.html,"Shares of Kalyan Jewellers are sharply lower in the trading session on August 8, down over 7 percent with volumes that are nearly three times the one-month average, despite a healthy June quarter result. On August 7, Kalyan reported a net profit of Rs 264 crore for the June quarter, up 49 percent on year, with revenue from operations higher by 31 percent at Rs 7,268.48 crore. The Q1FY26 EBITDA was higher by 38 percent on year at Rs 508 crore. Ramesh Kalyanaraman, ED, Kalyan Jewellers told CNBC-TV18 during an interaction that the Same Store Sales Growth has been 'very strong' in the range of 18 percent, maintaining the double-digit growth trend of past 6-8 quarters, and there are no triggers that would change this drastically. Going forward, the jeweller is hoping to benefit from more number of festive days in the ongoing Q2FY26. The jeweller also said it has reduced bank loans by Rs 500 crore so far. Rising Share of Organised Players The organised retail market share in the jewellery business has been consistently rising from 32 percent in 2020 to 40 percent this year, with high demand and ownership in the rural India. Kalyan said it is sitting with a 7 percent share in the organised pie, and its strong brand and scalable model positions it well to capitalise on the opportunity arising from the shift towards organised jewellery. The jeweller is expanding largely via a capital-light franchise store strategy. Kalayn also said it plans to launch new regional brands offering exclusively localised designs. On a YTD basis, the shares are down nearly 29 percent but are flat over last one year. Another leading company from the same space, Titan Company, has said that it is exploring 14 and 18-carat jewellery options in order to offer more affordable pricing for customers. Street View Motilal Oswal said in a note that with the successful ramp up of the new franchise businesses - which add 40 percent to the revenue - along with continued success in non-Southern markets, Kalyan has emerged as a leading brand, assigning a target price of Rs 1800 per share with a Buy call. Tariff Jitters The gems and jewellery space has also had to contend with the additional levy by US President Trump, which could make US exports unattractive for the sector as a whole. Trade think tank GTRI has said in a note that the India's export segments can be grouped in three categories - very high impact (exports hit of 50-70 percent), high-impact (30-50 percent hit), and low or no impact areas. Among the nine products in the very high impact category, diamonds, gold and jewellery are one of them. Gems and jewellery exporters' association GJEPC has urged the government for policy reforms to support the industry. America is the largest market for Indian gems and jewellery, accounting for over $10 billion in exports, which accounts for nearly 30 percent of the industry's total global trade, Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) chairman Kirit Bhansali has said. In an interaction with Bloomberg TV, TK Ramesh, the ED of Kalyan Jeweller said it plans to expand its Dubai manufacturing unit, potentially a move to offset any tariff-related setback. Impact of High Gold Prices Another leading company from the same space, Titan Company, has said that it is exploring 14 and 18-carat jewellery options in order to offer more affordable pricing for customers. In a separate development, the Financial Times has reported that the US has put tariffs on imports of one-kilogram gold bars, a move that could add volatility to the global bullion market, and is a setback for the precious metals business out of Switzerland, following which gold futures in New York have surged to a record high."

"NSDL rally continues: Shares surge 19% on Day 3, extend post-listing gains to 52%; m-cap rises to Rs 26,000 cr",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/nsdl-rally-continues-shares-surge-16-on-day-3-extend-post-listing-gains-to-48-m-cap-rises-to-rs-25-000-cr-13421289.html,"The shares of National Securities Depository (NSDL) gained nearly 19 percent on August 8, extending massive gains for the third consecutive session since market debut. The shares of the company are now more than 68 percent higher than the IPO price. The shares have now gained nearly 52 percent in the three sessions since their market debut. The market capitalization of the company surged significantly in the first three days to cross Rs 26,000-mark. The shares of NSDL had made a decent stock market debut on August 6, listing at Rs 880 apiece on BSE. This marked a premium of 10 percent over its IPO price at Rs 880 apiece. The listing premium was lower than grey market estimates. Ahead of listing, the unlisted shares of the company were trading with a grey market premium of nearly 16 percent over the IPO price. According to analysts, investors should consider holding the stock for the long term, given NSDL’s strong fundamentals and leadership in the depository segment. NSDL’s P/E ratio currently stands at around 77, higher than that of peer CDSL whose P/E ratio currently stands at around 66. ""NSDL’s post-listing performance has been nothing short of remarkable, with the stock rallying over 48% in just three sessions and market capitalisation crossing ₹25,000 crore. This surge underscores the market’s conviction in NSDL’s entrenched position within India’s capital market infrastructure. As one of only two depositories operating in a near-duopoly alongside CDSL, NSDL enjoys strong pricing power, high entry barriers, and a dominant share in value-based transactions and institutional account holdings,"" said Bhavik Joshi, Business Head, INVasset PMS. He noted that the stock's current P/E multiple of around 77 may appear stretched when compared to CDSL’s 66, but investors are clearly willing to pay a premium for its scale, technology backbone, and long-standing trust within the ecosystem. ""That said, prospective investors should be mindful of certain structural risks — dependence on transaction volumes, evolving investor participation patterns, and the ever-present cybersecurity and regulatory compliance requirements. In the near term, valuations may moderate if market activity slows, offering potential entry points for those who missed the IPO,"" he added. Siddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director of Vibhavangal Anukulakara Private Limited, meanwhile said, ""NSDL's strong post-listing rally...demonstrates strong investor belief in its market infrastructure position. As a core institution in India's financial system, NSDL's strong fundamentals and leadership position are obviously striking a chord with institutional and retail investors alike.""

"Bharti Airtel shares fall over 2 percent on large trade of equity worth over Rs 12,500 crore",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/bharti-airtel-shares-fall-over-2-percent-on-large-trade-of-equity-worth-over-rs-12-500-crore-13421194.html,"Shares of Bharti Airtel are lower by over 2 percent in early trade on August 8, emerging as the top loser on Nifty 50 index following a large trade that saw nearly one percent of the company's equity change hands, worth Rs 12,563 crore. Moneycontrol had reported a day before that Sunil Mittal-led promoter entity is looking at a part stake sale in the telecom major. ""The transaction has been launched at a floor price of Rs 1,862 per share, which is at a 3.15% discount to the last closing price,"" one of the persons familiar with the development had said. Indian Continent Investment, a Sunil Mittal-led promoter group entity that has likely trimmed its stake, holds 2.47% stake in Bharti Airtel. After the June quarter earnings, Morgan Stanley had maintained its 'equal-weight' on Airtel, with a price target of Rs 1,890 per share. CLSA had kept its 'outperform' rating with a target price of Rs 2,035 per share. Macquarie, too, had maintained 'outperform' rating with a price target of Rs 2,050 per share after the Q1FY26 results. Read More Bharti Airtel posted a robust free cashflow of Rs 14,500 crore and managed to trim net debt by Rs 13,000 crore sequentially to Rs 1.26 lakh crore in the June quarter. The telecom company is ramping up its fiber rollout from 1.6 million to 2.5 million home pass-ups per quarter, and is treating both FTTH and FWA under a single WiFi strategy. Airtel's ARPU rose to Rs 250, helped by a better subscriber mix and an extra day in the quarter. Airtel's digital network across India and Africa now serve over 60 crore customers. ""Africa reported solid performance with 6.7% growth in constant currency. India Mobile business recorded a sequential growth of 2.9%, driven by continued focus on portfolio premiumization..."", Gopal Vittal, Vice Chairman and MD of Bharti Airtel had said after the earnings. Over the last five years, Airtel has invested over Rs 1.6 trillion in expanding its digital infrastructure, and the company has said in the past that the capex will trend down in FY26, with a large part of the heavy lifting largely done. The data center capex is part of the overall capex to be incurred by the company and is on track with previous guidance of around Rs 5,000 crore spread over three years."
"Nifty, Sensex to see muted start as tariff pressures weigh; key levels to watch on August 8",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/nifty-sensex-to-see-muted-start-as-tariff-pressures-weigh-key-levels-to-watch-in-august-8-13420017.html,"Equity benchmarks Nifty 50 and Sensex could open mildly in the red on Friday, August 8, as President Donald Trump decision to double tariffs on Indian goods to 50 percent could pressure the bulls. At 7.30 am, the GIFT Nifty index was trading lower by 0.2 percent or 50 points at 24,644. In the previous session, Nifty 50 and Sensex staged a smart recovery in the last hour of trade, erasing sharp intraday losses, to eke out minor gains as possibilities of talks between U.S. and Russia lifted sentiment. Earlier in the session, the market took a sharp fall as U.S. President Donald Trump announced an additional 25 percent tariff on Indian goods, taking the total tariff rate to 50 percent. Trump's move comes in response to New Delhi’s continued purchases of Russian oil and defence equipment. After the order, the total tariff on Indian goods, barring a small exemption list, will be 50 percent. Here are the key levels to watch out for in today's session Yesterday's intraday pullback and strong close indicate possible short-term momentum building up for the sessions ahead, as concerns over tariff impositions failed to dent overall market sentiment. The 24,500 level continues to act as a pivotal support zone, reflecting resilience among buyers. Immediate support lies at 24,450, aligning with a previous demand zone. Unless breached decisively, any dip is likely to attract fresh buying interest. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart hovers around 40 but has started showing a positive divergence, hinting at easing bearish momentum. Intraday indicators also signal a reversal from oversold territory. ""The overall structure remains oversold, suggesting that any pullbacks may offer opportunities to initiate fresh long positions as optimism gradually returns,"" said Dhupesh Dhameja, Derivatives Research Analyst, SAMCO Securities. India VIX edged lower by 2.28 percent, closing at 11.68. Despite global tariff-related developments, implied volatility remains subdued and anchored near neutral territory. The persistent low VIX suggests the broader market is expecting consolidation rather than sharp downside risks, indicating that caution exists without panic.

Asian shares advance ahead of Trump's deadline for imposing higher tariffs on Chinese goods,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/asian-shares-advance-ahead-of-trumps-deadline-for-imposing-higher-tariffs-on-chinese-goods-2025-08-10/,"BANGKOK (AP) — Shares advanced in Asia on Monday, a day ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump’s deadline for imposing higher tariffs on goods imported from China. Markets in Japan and Thailand were closed for holidays. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong edged 0.2% higher to 24,908.37, while the Shanghai Composite index gained 0.5% to 3,653.50. Triple digit tariffs imposed by Trump and Beijing were paused for 90 days in May to allow time for talks. Tuesday is the deadline for extending that truce. The last round of negotiations, held last month in Stockholm, ended without a clear word from Trump on whether the deadline would be extended for another 90 days. Elsewhere in Asia, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.3% to 8,831.40, while the Kospi in South Korea was nearly unchanged, at 3,210.76. On Friday, the S&P 500 rose 0.8% to 6,389.45, just shy of its record high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.5% to 44,175.61, and the Nasdaq rose 1% to finish at 21,450.02. Technology companies, with their hefty stock values, did much of the heavy lifting for the market. Nvidia rose 1.1% and Apple gained 4.2%. Gilead Sciences jumped 8.3% for one of the market's biggest gains after reporting financial results that easily beat analysts' forecasts, while also raising its earnings forecast for the year. Expedia Group rose 4.1% after also reporting encouraging financial results. They are among the final big batch of companies within the S&P 500 to report mostly strong financial results for the second quarter. Still, many have warned that current tariffs could cut into their profits. Elsewhere in the market, entertainment giant Paramount Skydance slid 10.5% a day after the company was created by the closing of an $8 billion merger of Skydance and Paramount. Shares in rival Warner Bros. Discovery sank 8%. Investors will get more insight this week on U.S. inflation at both the consumer and wholesale levels and on retail sales. Trump’s trade war and its potential impact on the U.S. economy and on the Federal Reserve’s interest rate policy are a focus after the U.S. began imposing higher import taxes on dozens of countries last Thursday. The Fed’s last decision to hold interest rates steady included two votes to lower interest rates. Its next meeting is in September, and Wall Street is overwhelmingly betting that the central bank will cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point after signals have pointed to a weaking of the economy. Both are key concerns for the Fed, which has been trying to cool inflation down to its target rate of 2% while also fulfilling its “full employment” mandate. Lower interest rates can give the economy and investment prices a boost, though the downside is that they can also push inflation higher. Concerns about inflation reheating could be overshadowed by worries about a weakening employment market. In other dealings early Monday, U.S. benchmark crude oil shed 38 cents to $63.50 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, declined 31 cents to $66.28 per barrel. The U.S. dollar slipped to 147.46 Japanese yen from 147.62 yen. The euro rose to $1.1673 from $1.1650.

Leaders of Indonesia and Peru hold talks on trade and economic ties,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/leaders-of-indonesia-and-peru-hold-talks-on-trade-and-economic-ties-2025-08-10/,"JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Peruvian President Dina Boluarte met his Indonesian counterpart Prabowo Subianto on Monday during a visit aimed at strengthening economic ties as the two countries for new markets amid geopolitical challenges and rising trade barriers. The signing came just four days after the U.S. President Donald Trump began imposing higher import taxes on dozens of countries on Thursday, including a 19% rate on Indonesia. Imports from Peru are paying the 10% baseline rate Trump set in April. Boluarte arrived in Indonesia’s capital of Jakarta on Sunday afternoon, following an invitation President Prabowo extended when the two leaders met at the APEC Summit in Peru in November 2024. The two-day visit is aimed at deepening Peru’s ties with Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s largest economy, after the two nations concluded negotiations which began in May on a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement or CEPA. Subianto hosted Boluarte with a ceremony at Merdeka palace in Jakarta before the two leaders lead a closed-door bilateral meeting. The two leaders are expected to witness the signing of CEPA that could be a major booster to bilateral trade, said Indonesia’s trade minister Budi Santoso ahead of the visit. “The CEPA deal with Peru is a potential gateway for Indonesian goods and services to enter markets in Central and South America,” Santoso said, “We hope the deal can strengthen Indonesia’s trade presence in the region.” His ministry’s data showed the country’s total trade with Peru went down from $554.2 million in 2022 to $444.4 million the following year, while Indonesia enjoyed a $290.4 million trade surplus in 2023, driven by major exports including vehicles, footwear and biodiesel. Indonesia is currently seeking membership of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, which Peru is part of, to boost export growth."

'Weapons' horror film scores a box office victory,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/weapons-horror-film-scores-a-box-office-victory-2025-08-10/,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — It’s August, and horror and humor came to play. In a month that’s long been known to let edgier movies thrive, Zach Cregger’s highly anticipated horror film “Weapons” did not disappoint, topping the box office during its debut weekend with $42.5 million domestically from 3,202 theaters. It made $70 million internationally. The film’s success also handed its distributor, Warner Bros. Pictures, the seventh No. 1 opening of the year, and became the studio’s sixth film in a row to debut with over $40 million domestically. “Freakier Friday,” Disney’s chaotic sequel to the 2003 classic, “Freaky Friday,” took the second spot during its premiere weekend, earning $29 million in 3,975 North American theaters. Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis return, this time for a double body-swapping between the mother-daughter duo and Lohan’s teen daughter and soon-to-be stepdaughter. Viral marketing tactics, coupled with strong social media word-of-mouth, boded well for both films’ success, said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for the data firm Comscore. “The top two films could not be more different, and that’s what makes this weekend so appealing for moviegoers,” Dergarabedian said. “Both are perfectly tailored for their audiences to react in real time over the weekend to these films and then post on social media.” “Weapons” transports audiences to the small town of Maybrook, where 17 kids up and leave their homes at 2:17 a.m., leaving bewildered parents in their wake. The town is left to navigate the lingering effects of trauma through horror, paranoia and a touch of existential humor. The film is Cregger’s follow-up to his solo directorial debut with the 2022 genre-bending horror, “Barbarian.” That critically-acclaimed film had a slower start and smaller budget, but still topped the charts during its premiere with $10 million domestically and made a splash in the genre. “Weapons” generated a lot of buzz for its strong reviews (95% on Rotten Tomatoes). “The internet’s exploding right now between Friday and today. You just see that people are having a great time with it,” said Jeffrey Goldstein, president of global distribution for Warner Bros. “It starts with an exceptional movie, an exceptional marketing campaign, and the date was exceptional too.” The success of the comedy-horror double premiere meant “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” surrendered its two-week run in the top spot and landed in the third position, bringing in $15.5 million domestically. The superhero movie enjoyed a strong $118 million debut, but stumbled in its second weekend. “The Bad Guys 2,” which got a healthy start at the No. 2 spot during its premiere weekend, came in fourth place, earning $10.4 million domestically. “The Naked Gun” had a similar fate, reaching the fifth position with $8.4 million in North American theaters. “Jurassic World Rebirth,” which came in seventh this week, is expected to hit $800 million globally by Monday, according to NBC Universal, following a successful run in theaters. Warner Bros. started off slow this year, but made a comeback with the box-office hit, “A Minecraft Movie,” which opened with $157 million domestically. Since then, movies like “Sinners,” “Superman” and now, “Weapons,” have found success. The studio set “a blueprint to how to create a perfect summer lineup,” Dergarabedian said. “Weapons ”also joins a stream of successful horror movies this year, its opening numbers coming in just behind “Final Destination: Bloodlines” and “Sinners.” With final domestic figures being released Monday, this list factors in the estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore: 1. “Weapons,” $42.5 million. 2. “Freakier Friday,” $29 million. 3. “The Fantastic Four: First Steps,” $15.5 million. 4. “The Bad Guys 2,” $10.4 million. 5. “The Naked Gun,” $8.4 million. 6. “Superman,” $7.8 million. 7. “Jurassic World Rebirth,” $4.7 million. 8. “F1: The Movie,” $2.9 million. 9. “Together,” $2.6 million. 10. “Sketch,” $2.5 million."
3 Dividend Stocks Raising Payouts—and Backing It Up With Results,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/3-dividend-stocks-raising-payoutsand-backing-it-up-with-results/,"Not all dividends are paid out equally; some companies try to create a “trap” by overpaying on a quarter’s dividend, attracting buyers through a short-term high dividend yield that seems too good to pass up. The realization comes much later, though, that these companies can’t afford these payouts, straining the financial profile altogether and having to decrease or cancel these dividends later. Today’s list of dividend increases focuses on the exact opposite of this situation. These companies and their solid fundamentals demonstrate that they can not only afford today’s increases but also continue to reward shareholders with rising income potential in the coming quarters and years. This should also generate demand and upside for the stock itself during a market filled with macroeconomic uncertainty. This is why considering names like Clorox Co. NYSE: CLX, Wells Fargo & Co. NYSE: WFC, and Sunoco LP NYSE: SUN can be an excellent combination for investors to keep in their dividend income watchlists. This group, which includes financial sector, consumer staples, and energy stocks, provides enough diversification and financial strength to carry portfolios forward. Now that shares of Clorox have fallen to 72% of their 52-week high, their attractive dividend payout has only become more of a target after a recent increase. As stocks in other (hotter) market areas take the bulk of the bullish price action and attention, it makes sense to see a more stable company like Clorox fall behind. However, this is precisely when a competent management team typically lays out further shareholder benefits, rewarding those willing to stick around for the “bad” times in the price performance. Now paying $4.88 per dividend share, Clorox investors can enjoy a 3.94% dividend yield today. Although not the highest and still below the benchmark 10-year treasury bond yields of 4.2%, this dividend provides an added benefit to the upside that can be achieved by buying Clorox stock today. Even though Wall Street analysts rate the stock as a Reduce, recent data may soon change that. The company’s latest quarterly earnings show a net earnings per share (EPS) figure of $2.87, representing a significant beat over the expected $2.24 number from Wall Street, showing analysts that their current valuations and assumptions may have been on the more conservative side, and calling for a revision (likely higher). Now that the market expects the Federal Reserve (the Fed) to lower interest rates in late 2025, sharp investors can directly spot the benefits of investing in a commercial bank like Wells Fargo, since lower rates typically translate to more demand for credit products like mortgages and credit cards. Of course, it should raise the bank’s expected EPS figures, which it has. Wall Street analysts now expect to see a report $1.73 in EPS for the second quarter of 2026, an increase of 12% above today’s $1.54 in reported EPS, which was also a beat over the expected $1.41. Chances are, these forecasts for next year are also conservative, setting Wells Fargo up for another beat. With this confidence in mind, and the right macro backdrop, the bank’s management boosted its dividend payout to $1.8 per share, or an annualized yield of 2.3%. While not the most exciting yield, investors should take this as a sign of stable and strong financials, with some upside added. With a current forward price-to-earnings (P/E) valuation of 12.6x, Wells Fargo stock is well below its longer-term average of 18.0x, giving investors a decent gap to be closed on the upside. As oil prices remain low for an extended period, more investors will likely overlook energy stocks like Sunoco. However, management is aware of the cyclical nature of oil and is already preparing its shareholders for a reality check. After boosting its dividend payout to $3.63 per share, investors can now beat the benchmark and any inflation fears through an annualized yield of 6.68% today. The stock's ability to afford this much of an increase and also trade at 90% of its 52-week high may have given Wall Street analysts something to think about. That thought led to a consensus rating making Sunoco stock a Buy, with Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan Chase & Co. giving a new valuation target slightly above consensus for $67 per share, which also implies an additional 25% upside potential from where the stock trades today, giving investors the best of both income and upside potential benefits.

3 Stocks With Monopoly Power—and Minimal Competition,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/3-stocks-with-monopoly-powerand-minimal-competition/,"The word ""monopoly"" has a negative reputation in the investment and economic communities, as it is often linked to abusive pricing and unfair advantages that many other businesses and investors might not face. However, monopolies (or near-monopolies for that matter) can also mean outsized returns for investors who can spot them. And the truth is that these near-monopolies are everywhere in the market. However, they lie low enough to avoid the inevitably negative media coverage that could come if they were to be identified for what they are. With this in mind, today’s list of near-monopoly stocks can offer investors much-needed upside during an uncertain economic and financial cycle for the United States. Fitting the description, names like Copart Inc. NASDAQ: CPRT, ASML Holding NASDAQ: ASML, and Fair Isaac Corporation NYSE: FICO are examples. These names hold enough market share in their respective spaces, such as the technology sector, and trade at enough of a discount that they just can’t be ignored today. This opportunity is likely a closing window, as big institutions are likely already circling around the buy button for these businesses. Accidents happen; every investor understands this. What they don’t realize is what happens to most vehicles after accidents. Usually, a company like Copart buys the damaged vehicles (considered a total loss) from insurance companies, repairs them at cost, and then sells them at a profit at auctions. This is a quiet area of the economy. Still, it is a hot one, and Copart brings in $4.7 billion in net revenue from it through owning roughly 40% of the entire space. This market share moat, brand penetration, and logistics capability keep Copart as a name that could be considered a near monopoly in its own field. Given that this powerful name now trades at 71% of its 52-week high, investors can assume that the downside risk is largely priced in for Copart, leaving it with little choice but to start heading higher and reflect its true fundamentals. This setup might explain why Motley Fool Asset Management, a known stock picker in the financial community, decided to buy up to $2.4 million worth of Copart stock as of August 2025, providing a vote of confidence in the price recovery that’s pending for this company in the future. The same line of thought can spill over onto ASML stock, considering it is one of the leading lithography technology companies, providing the necessary equipment for the chipmaking and semiconductor stocks that have helped the S&P 500 index run as high as it has today. There is very little competition in this space, since lithography is well-patented and kept as a hidden treasure to ensure ASML’s positioning in the industry is left unchecked, a true near monopoly if there ever was one. Given the industry's recent surge, ASML’s price of only 73% of its 52-week high may have triggered some systemic buying on Wall Street. As of early August 2025, institutional allocators from Envestnet Asset Management decided to kick their quarterly activity up a notch, as they justified buying an additional 0.7% in ASML stock for their current holdings. While this may not seem like much in percentage terms, it did bring their entire position to a high of $347.5 million, making them the largest institutional holder in ASML stock today. Every American knows the importance of having a good credit history, which essentially comes along with a sound credit score. A single entity runs this system across the nation’s banking and lending system: Fair Isaac Corporation. Without credit scores, homes, cars, or credit cards wouldn't be issued at the volumes they are and have been for decades. This unique positioning, along with governmental and regulatory moats, makes the stock a feared opponent for anyone willing to go short into it for the long term. While the bears have enjoyed a recent win now that the stock trades at only 57% of its 52-week high, that run may soon come to an end. Wall Street analysts see the stock’s fair value at $2,163 per share. In their consensus price target, they are shooting for a net rally of 56.4% from the current trading level. This much upside potential, and the fact that there is really no reason for the stock to be trading this low, has driven the market to place a valuation premium of 54.1x price-to-earnings (P/E) on the stock, compared to the services industry average of only 38x today. While some may argue this only makes the stock prone to further declines, seasoned participants know that the market is always willing to put a premium on names that it believes can outperform the peer group and the broader market. Fair Isaac’s positioning may justify that belief. Before you consider ASML, you'll want to hear this."
Commercial fishing in a vast Pacific nature area is halted after a judge blocks a Trump order,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/commercial-fishing-in-a-vast-pacific-nature-area-is-halted-after-a-judge-blocks-a-trump-order-2025-08-09/,"HONOLULU (AP) — Commercial fishing that recently resumed in a vast protected area of the Pacific Ocean must halt once again, after a judge in Hawaii sided this week with environmentalists challenging a Trump administration rollback of federal ocean protections. The remote Pacific Islands Heritage Marine National Monument is home to turtles, marine mammals and seabirds, which environmental groups say will get snagged by longline fishing, an industrial method involving baited hooks from lines 60 miles (about 100 kilometers) or longer. President Donald Trump's executive order to allow this and other types of commercial fishing in part of the monument changed regulations without providing a process for public comment and rulemaking and stripped core protections from the monument, the groups argued in a lawsuit. U.S. District Judge Micah W. J. Smith granted a motion by the environmentalists on Friday. The ruling means boats catching fish for sale will need to immediately cease fishing in waters between 50 and 200 nautical miles (93 kilometers to 370 kilometers) around Johnston Atoll, Jarvis Island and Wake Island, said Earthjustice, an environmental law organization representing the plaintiffs. U.S. Justice Department attorneys representing the government did not immediately return an email message seeking comment on Saturday. Trump has said the U.S. should be “the world’s dominant seafood leader,” and on the same day of his April executive order, he issued another one seeking to boost commercial fishing by peeling back regulations and opening up harvesting in previously protected areas. President George W. Bush created the marine monument in 2009. It consists of about 500,000 square miles (1.3 million square kilometers) in the remote central Pacific Ocean southwest of Hawaii. President Barack Obama expanded it in 2014. Soon after Trump's executive order, the National Marine Fisheries Service sent a letter to fishing permit holders giving them the green light to fish commercially in the monument's boundaries, Earthjustice's lawsuit says. Fishing resumed within days, the group said. Government attorneys say the fisheries service’s letter merely notified commercial fishers of a change that had already taken place through Trump’s authority to remove the prohibition on commercial fishing in certain areas. Earthjustice challenged that letter, and by granting the motion in their favor, the federal judge found the government had chosen not to defend its letter on the merits and forfeited that argument. Smith also ruled against the government's other defenses, that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the letter and that the court lacked jurisdiction over the matter. David Henkin, an Earthjustice attorney, said Smith's ruling requires the government to go through a process to determine what kind of fishing, and under what conditions, can happen in monument waters in a way that wouldn't destroy the area. Members of Hawaii’s longline fishing industry say they have made numerous gear adjustments and changes over the years, such as circle hooks, to avoid that. The lawsuit says allowing commercial fishing in the monument expansion would also harm the “cultural, spiritual, religious, subsistence, educational, recreational, and aesthetic interests” of a group of Native Hawaiian plaintiffs who are connected genealogically to the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific."
Thousands march against plan to build massive bridge linking Sicily to Italy's mainland,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/thousands-march-against-plan-to-build-massive-bridge-linking-sicily-to-italys-mainland-2025-08-09/,"ROME (AP) — Thousands of people marched in the Sicilian city of Messina on Saturday to protest a government plan to build a bridge that would connect the Italian mainland with Sicily in a massive 13.5-billion-euro ($15.5 billion) infrastructure project. Protesters staunchly oppose the Strait of Messina Bridge project over its scale, earthquake threats, environmental impact and the specter of mafia interference. The idea to build a bridge to connect Sicily to the rest of Italy has been debated off and on for decades but always delayed due to these concerns. The project, however, took a major step forward when a government committee overseeing strategic public investments approved the plan this week. Transport Minister Matteo Salvini, the project’s main political backer, called it “the biggest infrastructure project in the West.” Salvini cited studies estimating the project would create up to 120,000 jobs annually and help stimulate economic growth in economically lagging southern Italy, as billions more are invested in surrounding road and infrastructure improvements. Opponents are not convinced by these arguments. They are also angry that about 500 families would have to be expropriated in order for the bridge to be built. “The Strait of Messina can’t be touched,” protesters shouted as they marched in Messina. Many carried banners that said “No Ponte” (No Bridge). Organizers estimated crowd size at 10,000 people. The proposed bridge would span nearly 3.7 kilometers (2.2 miles) with a suspended section of 3.3 kilometers (more than 2 miles). It would surpass Turkey’s Canakkale Bridge by 1,277 meters (4,189 feet) to become the longest suspension bridge in the world. Preliminary work could begin as early as late September or early October, pending approval from Italy’s Court of Audit. Full construction is scheduled to begin in 2026, with completion targeted between 2032 and 2033. Plans for a bridge have been approved and canceled multiple times since the Italian government first solicited proposals for one in 1969. Premier Giorgia Meloni’s administration revived the project in 2023. With three car lanes in each direction flanked by a double-track railway, the bridge would have the capacity to carry 6,000 cars an hour and 200 trains a day — reducing the time to cross the strait by ferry from up to 100 minutes to 10 minutes by car. Trains would save 2/12 hours in transit time, Salvini said. The project could also support Italy’s commitment to raise defense spending to 5% of GDP targeted by NATO, as the government has indicated it would classify the bridge as defense-related. Italy argues that the bridge would form a strategic corridor for rapid troop movements and equipment deployment, qualifying it as “security-enhancing infrastructure.” Environmental groups, however, have lodged complaints with the EU, citing concerns that the project would impact migratory birds. Italy’s president has also insisted that the project remain subject to anti-mafia legislation that applies to all large-scale infrastructure projects. Salvini pledged that keeping organized crime out of the project was a top priority."
"$7K worth of Labubu dolls stolen from Los Angeles store, authorities say",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/7k-worth-of-labubu-dolls-stolen-from-los-angeles-store-authorities-say-2025-08-09/,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — A group of masked thieves stole about $7,000 worth of Labubu dolls from a Los Angeles-area store this week, authorities said. The incident took place early Wednesday morning at a store in La Puente, a city about 18 miles (29 kilometers) east of Los Angeles, the LA County Sheriff's Department said. The department said the suspects used a stolen Toyota Tacoma in the incident, which was recovered shortly afterward. The agency said it was investigating the case and did not have additional information. Labubu dolls, created by Hong Kong-born artist Kasing Lung, have become a popular collectible item a decade after the toothy monsters were first introduced. Toy vendor One Stop Sales said in an Instagram post that the thieves took all of the store's inventory and trashed the establishment. The store posted surveillance footage showing a group of people wearing hoodies and face coverings breaking in. The suspects are seen shuffling through items and carrying boxes out of the shop. “We are still in shock,” the store said in its post, urging people to help find the thieves. ___ This story has been updated to correct the store's name. It is One Stop Sales, not One Stop Shop."
A top Federal Reserve official says dour jobs data backs the case for 3 rate cuts,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/a-top-federal-reserve-official-says-dour-jobs-data-backs-the-case-for-3-rate-cuts-2025-08-09/,"NEW YORK (AP) — A top official at the Federal Reserve said Saturday that this month's stunning, weaker-than-expected report on the U.S. job market is strengthening her belief that interest rates should be lower. Michelle Bowman was one of two Fed officials who voted a week and a half ago in favor of cutting interest rates. Such a move could help boost the economy by making it cheaper for people to borrow money to buy a house or a car, but it could also threaten to push inflation higher. Bowman and a fellow dissenter lost out after nine other Fed officials voted to keep interest rates steady, as the Fed has been doing all year. The Fed's chair, Jerome Powell, has been adamant that he wants to wait for more data about how President Donald Trump's tariffs are affecting inflation before the Fed makes its next move. At a speech during a bankers' conference in Colorado on Saturday, Bowman said that “the latest labor market data reinforce my view” that the Fed should cut interest rates three times this year. The Fed has only three meetings left on the schedule in 2025. The jobs report that arrived last week, only a couple of days after the Fed voted on interest rates, showed that employers hired far fewer workers last month than economists expected. It also said that hiring in prior months was much lower than initially thought. On inflation, meanwhile, Bowman said she is getting more confident that Trump's tariffs “will not present a persistent shock to inflation” and sees it moving closer to the Fed's 2% target. Inflation has come down substantially since hitting a peak above 9% after the pandemic, but it has been stubbornly remaining above 2%. The Fed’s job is to keep the job market strong, while keeping a lid on inflation. Its challenge is that it has one main tool to affect both those areas, and helping one by moving interest rates up or down often means hurting the other. A fear is that Trump's tariffs could box in the Federal Reserve by sticking the economy in a worst-case scenario called “stagflation,” where the economy stagnates but inflation is high. The Fed has no good tool to fix that, and it would likely have to prioritize either the job market or inflation before helping the other. On Wall Street, expectations are that the Fed will have to cut interest rates at its next meeting in September after the U.S. jobs report came in so much below economists' expectations. Trump has been calling angrily for lower interest rates, often personally insulting Powell while doing so. He has the opportunity to add another person to the Fed's board of governors after an appointee of former President Joe Biden stepped down recently."
Rocket Lab Reports Q2 Results: Is the Bull Thesis Still Intact?,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/rocket-lab-reports-q2-results-is-the-bull-thesis-still-intact/,"Rocket Lab USA, Inc. NASDAQ: RKLB has been one of the standout names in the aerospace industry, riding a wave of strong performance and growing investor enthusiasm. The stock has surged in recent months, cementing its position as a leader in small satellite launches and advanced space systems. With its Electron rocket now proven one of the market's most reliable vehicles and the Neutron program making steady progress, the company has built a compelling long-term growth story. The release of its latest earnings was the next major catalyst, with investors watching closely to see if the momentum could continue or if cracks might start to appear. On August 7, Rocket Lab reported Q2 2025 revenue of $144.5 million, up 36% year-over-year (YOY) and 17.9% from Q1. This figure exceeded its guidance range of $130–$140 million. Growth was fueled by increased launch activity, including five Electron missions in the quarter, and continued expansion in satellite manufacturing and components. The company also achieved notable margin gains, with GAAP gross margin rising to 32.1% and non-GAAP gross margin climbing to 36.9%, both significantly improving from last year. Not everything was perfect, though. The company’s net losses widened 59.5% to $66.4 million, marking the fifth consecutive year in the red. For Q2, Rocket Lab reported earnings per share (EPS) of negative 13 cents, missing the consensus estimates of negative seven cents. However, management emphasized that these losses reflect ongoing investment in the Neutron rocket program and strategic expansions to position Rocket Lab for long-term growth. The backlog remains robust at $1 billion, evenly split between launch and space systems, and features a healthy mix of government and commercial contracts. A key highlight from the quarter was the pending acquisition of Geost, a $275 million cash-and-equity deal expected to close soon following antitrust clearance. Geost’s expertise in electro-optical and infrared sensors will bolster Rocket Lab’s capabilities in missile warning, tracking, and space domain awareness, opening new high-value opportunities in national security. Operationally, Rocket Lab reached a significant milestone by proving a rapid launch cadence, completing two missions just two days apart from its New Zealand site. With 69 Electron launches completed to date, the company remains on track for more than 20 launches in 2025. Meanwhile, the Neutron program continues to advance, with Stage 2 successfully cryogenically proofed and en route to Launch Complex 3 in Virginia ahead of its debut launch, targeted before the end of the year. When asked what a successful launch of Neutron might be, during the earnings call, CEO Sir Peter Beck had to say: “You're not going to hear some rubbish about just clearing the pad as success. For us, a successful launch means getting to orbit and ensuring the vehicle is ready to scale."" A response RKLB investors surely would have liked. For Q3 2025, Rocket Lab is guiding for revenue between $145 million and $155 million, with further margin expansion expected. Beyond the near term, management stressed that the Neutron program is shifting from R&D into production, with supply chains, manufacturing infrastructure, and launch facilities already in place to support scalable operations. The long-term thesis for Rocket Lab appears firmly intact. While the company continues to post annual losses, it is steadily expanding its capabilities across launch, spacecraft, and payload integration. This diversification, especially with national security and constellation deployment contracts, gives Rocket Lab a unique position as a one-stop provider. The road ahead will still have its challenges, but for bullish investors, the latest results reinforce the view that Rocket Lab is not just competing in the new space race; it’s helping lead it. Before you consider Rocket Lab, you'll want to hear this."
Trump GLP-1 Pilot Program Could Boost Novo Nordisk & Eli Lilly,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/trump-glp-1-pilot-program-could-boost-novo-nordisk-and-eli-lilly/,"This week, drugmakers had a scare when President Trump threatened to levy tariffs of up to 250% on imported pharmaceuticals. The news jolted the health care sector, which fell by 2.74% over the past five days, compounding its struggles this year, which have resulted in its 5.13% loss—the worst among all 11 sectors in the S&P 500. On an individual level, some Big Pharma companies experienced more pain than others. Novo Nordisk NYSE: NVO, which reported disappointing earnings on Aug. 6, fell 5.79% over the past five days before rebounding on weak trial data from Eli Lilly NYSE: LLY. The latter company’s experimental weight-loss pill fell short of expectations, sending shares down by nearly 11% over the same period while helping Novo Nordisk rebound from subpar earnings and the Trump tariff announcement. But for buy-and-hold investors looking for health care sector exposure, those two stocks—NVO and LLY—are still poised to profit from a long-term tailwind recently introduced by the Trump administration. While the tariff threat is real, long-term investors may want to look past the short-term volatility. A recently announced Trump administration initiative could be a game-changer for both companies. On Aug. 1, reports surfaced that the Trump administration is testing a plan to cover costly weight loss drugs like Mounjaro and Ozempic under Medicare and Medicaid. The program, led by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI)—a branch of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)—is scheduled to launch in April 2026 for Medicaid and January 2027 for Medicare. That plan would vastly expand Americans’ access to anti-obesity drugs, including those who currently cannot afford their price tags. Wegovy and Zepbound, for example, cost roughly $1,000 per month before insurance, which carries strict eligibility criteria. If the plan pans out, it would be an enormous boon to Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. Currently, many health insurance plans, as well Medicare, only cover GLP-1 treatment for diabetes. The use of those drugs for obesity treatment is excluded. Additionally, Medicaid coverage of obesity drugs and treatments varies on a state-by-state basis. But according to the CMS, if the Trump administration’s plan comes to fruition, it would allow Medicare Part D and state Medicaid programs to voluntarily cover Mounjaro, Zepbound, Ozempic, and Wegovy not just for diabetes treatments, but for weight loss management as well. Despite Eli Lilly’s recent woes, when the company reported Q2 earnings on Aug. 7, it was abundantly clear to investors that it has positioned itself alongside Novo Nordisk as the world’s two premier drugmakers for ​​Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) weight loss treatments. The company beat on earnings while also hiking its 2025 guidance and announcing ongoing strong demand for its anti-obesity drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound. Meanwhile, Novo Nordisk just barely missed on revenue, reporting $11.95 billion versus analysts’ expectations of $11.97 billion, while reporting earnings per share of 93 cents versus analysts’ expectations of 95 cents. But lost in those misses was the fact that sales of its diabetes drug Ozempic and its weight loss drug Wegovy saw second-quarter sales increase by 16% from the year-prior period. Together, these companies have formed a duopoly in the GLP-1 space, similar to Coca-Cola NYSE: KO and PepsiCo NASDAQ: PEP in beverages or Home Depot NYSE: HD and Lowe’s NYSE: LOW in home improvement. It is increasingly evident that, despite their recent issues, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly have established themselves as the two principal pillars of the anti-obesity and diabetes drug industry. And thanks to the current administration's proposal to inject GLP-1 into Medicare and Medicaid plans, the two companies are positioned to see more sales gains from their flagship drugs. Zooming out, the anti-obesity industry is already undergoing explosive growth. According to market research and consultancy firm Grand View Research, the global weight loss drug market is forecast to undergo a noteworthy compound annual growth rate of 31.66% from 2024 to 2030. However, that market is dominated by North America, which presently accounts for 37.67% of revenue share. In the United States, the anti-obesity drug market size already stands at $6.62 billion, and it is projected to reach $7.13 billion by 2030. Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk may be down 14.49% and 44.22%, respectively, this year, but if Trump’s Medicare and Medicaid pilot program takes root, it could serve as the impetus to reverse the two Big Pharma drugmakers’ fortunes this year. Value investors looking for a buy-low opportunity in the health care sector would be wise to keep both stocks on their watchlists. Before you consider Eli Lilly and Company, you'll want to hear this."
Whitmer told Trump in private that Michigan auto jobs depend on a tariff change of course,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/whitmer-told-trump-in-private-that-michigan-auto-jobs-depend-on-a-tariff-change-of-course-2025-08-09/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer met privately in the Oval Office with President Donald Trump to make a case he did not want to hear: The automotive industry he said he wants to save was being hurt by his tariffs. The Democrat came with a slide deck to make her points in a visual presentation. Just getting the meeting Tuesday with the Republican president was an achievement for someone viewed as a contender for her party's White House nomination in 2028. Whitmer’s strategy for dealing with Trump highlights the conundrum for her and other Democratic leaders as they try to protect the interests of their states while voicing their opposition to his agenda. It's a dynamic that Whitmer has navigated much differently from many other Democratic governors. The fact that Whitmer had “an opening to make direct appeals” in private to Trump was unique in this political moment, said Matt Grossman, a Michigan State University politics professor. It was her third meeting with Trump at the White House since he took office in January. This one, however, was far less public than the time in April when Whitmer was unwittingly part of an impromptu news conference that embarrassed her so much she covered her face with a folder. On Tuesday, she told the president that the economic damage from the tariffs could be severe in Michigan, a state that helped deliver him the White House in 2024. Whitmer also brought up federal support for recovery efforts after an ice storm and sought to delay changes to Medicaid. Trump offered no specific commitments, according to people familiar with the private conversation who were not authorized to discuss it publicly and spoke only on condition of anonymity to describe it. Whitmer is hardly the only one sounding the warning of the potentially damaging consequences, including factory job losses, lower profits and coming price increases, of the import taxes that Trump has said will be the economic salvation for American manufacturing. White House spokesman Kush Desai said no other president “has taken a greater interest in restoring American auto industry dominance than President Trump."" Trade frameworks negotiated by the administration would open up the Japanese, Korean and European markets for vehicles made on assembly lines in Michigan, Desai said. But the outreach Trump has preferred tends to be splashy presentations by tech CEOs. In the Oval Office on Wednesday, Apple CEO Tim Cook gave the president a customized glass plaque with a gold base as Cook promised $600 billion in investments. Trump claims to have brought in $17 trillion in investment commitments, although none of those numbers has surfaced yet in economic data. Under his series of executive orders and trade frameworks, U.S. automakers face import taxes of 50% on steel and aluminum, 30% on parts from China and a top rate of 25% on goods from Canada and Mexico not covered under an existing 2020 trade agreement. That puts America's automakers and parts suppliers at a disadvantage against German, Japanese and South Korean vehicles that only face a 15% import tax negotiated by Trump last month. On top of that, Trump this past week threatened a 100% tariff on computer chips, which are an integral part of cars and trucks, though he would exclude companies that produce chips domestically from the tax. Whitmer's two earlier meetings with Trump resulted in gains for Michigan. But the tariffs represent a significantly broader request of a president who has imposed them even more aggressively in the face of criticism. Materials in the presentation brought by Whitmer to the meeting and obtained by The Associated Press noted how trade with Canada and Mexico has driven $23.2 billion in investment to Michigan since 2020. General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis operate 50 factories across the state, while more than 4,000 facilities support the auto parts supply chain. Altogether, the sector supports nearly 600,000 manufacturing jobs, forming the backbone of Michigan’s economy. Whitmer outlined the main points of the materials to Trump and left copies with his team. To Grossman, the Michigan State professor, a key question is whether voters who expected to be helped by tariffs would react if Trump’s import taxes failed to deliver the promised economic growth. “Everyone’s aware that Michigan is a critical swing state and the auto industry has outsized influence, not just directly, but symbolically,” Grossman said. AP VoteCast found that Trump won Michigan in 2024 largely because two-thirds of its voters described the economic conditions as being poor or “not so good.” Roughly 70% of the voters in the state who felt negatively about the economy backed the Republican. The state was essentially split over whether tariffs were a positive, with Trump getting 76% of those voters who viewed them favorably. The heads of General Motors, Ford and Stellantis have repeatedly warned the administration that the tariffs would cut company profits and undermine their global competitiveness. Their efforts have resulted in little more than a temporary, monthlong pause intended to give companies time to adjust. The reprieve did little to blunt the financial fallout. In the second quarter alone, Ford reported $800 million in tariff-related costs, while GM said the import taxes cost it $1.1 billion. Those expenses could make it harder to reinvest in new domestic factories, a goal Trump has championed. “We expect tariffs to be a net headwind of about $2 billion this year, and we’ll continue to monitor the developments closely and engage with policymakers to ensure U.S. autoworkers and customers are not disadvantaged by policy change,” Ford CEO Jim Farley said on his company's earning call. Since Trump returned to the White House, Michigan has lost 7,500 manufacturing jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Smaller suppliers have felt the strain, too. Detroit Axle, a family-run auto parts distributor, has been one of the more vocal companies in Michigan about the impact of the tariffs. The company initially announced it might have to shut down a warehouse and lay off more than 100 workers, but later said it would be able to keep the facility open, at least for now. “Right now it's a market of who is able to survive, it's not a matter of who can thrive,” said Mike Musheinesh, owner of Detroit Axle."
Now Is a Great Time to Buy Cheniere Energy: New High Expected,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/now-is-a-great-time-to-buy-cheniere-energy-new-high-expected/,"August and Q3 2025 are great times to buy Cheniere Energy NYSE: LNG. The Q2 results and outlook affirmed the bullish forecasts that have been driving the price action all year. The estimates are based on rising LNG demand supported by new infrastructure, compounded by the need for affordable, efficient, greener energy supplies. The critical takeaway from the release is that business is stronger than expected, profitability is robust, and the guidance improved, news that will likely extend the stock price uptrend to new highs. The new high is a significant factor for investors and traders. LNG stock has been in a strong uptrend, recently formed a triangle consolidation pattern, and looks set to extend its rally. A break to new highs would confirm the triangle as a continuation signal, potentially the halfway point in a larger rally, and lead this market into another substantial rally. Based on the technical setup ahead of the report, the market for LNG stock could rise by $70 to $80 in that scenario within a few quarters and up to another $60 over the long term. The analysts’ sentiment, a gauge of broader market sentiment, was bullish ahead of the release and will likely strengthen in its wake. The data tracked by MarketBeat reveals coverage increasing, sentiment firming to a Buy, and the consensus price target rising compared to July, the prior quarter, and the preceding year. At $260, the consensus is sufficient to put this market at a new high, break it out of the trading range, and set it up for a run toward the high-end range. That puts this market near $288, but higher targets are expected to follow. Cheniere had a solid quarter in Q2, supported by demand, volume, pricing, and the favorable impact of derivative hedging instruments. The net result is a 42.8% increase in net revenue and a significantly wider margin. Revenue outpaced the consensus by more than 800 basis points, while GAAP EPS more than doubled. The critical details are that demand, execution, and margin are expected to remain strong through the year’s end, allowing the company to improve its guidance. The note details include the adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow targets, which were lifted at the low end, tightened in the first case, and lifted and tightened in the second. Distributable cash flow is among the reasons why analysts like this stock and will likely improve their price target forecasts in Q3. The company returns ample capital to its investors, including dividends and share repurchases, and is running with a sub-50% distributable cash flow payout ratio. This allows the company to reinvest in its growth while paying down debt and improving its balance sheet health. The balance sheet highlights at the end of Q2 include reduced cash, but it is offset by increased assets, reduced debt and total liability, low leverage, and increased equity. Equity increased by 11%, the share count fell by nearly 3%, and the dividend annualized to 0.85% as of the end of the reporting period. The Institutional trends also align with LNG’s stock price outlook. They own more than 87% of the stock and have been buying on balance all year. The volume of activity has declined since Q1, but the balance improved sequentially, rising to a ratio of 4:1 regarding dollar buying and selling volume. This trend is not expected to end in Q3 but may strengthen due to the profit outlook and capital return. Before you consider Cheniere Energy, you'll want to hear this."
MarketBeat Week in Review – 08/04 - 08/08,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/marketbeat-week-in-review-08-04-08-08/,"Stocks shook off last Friday’s sell-off with a positive week, but it wasn’t all smooth sailing. Tariff concerns weighed on stocks on Thursday and will continue to be a source of long-term uncertainty. However, for now, the trend is your friend, and that trend is higher. Some of that optimism is based on expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut rates twice in the back half of 2025. However, those expectations may change next week when investors get the latest reading on inflation, the July Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI), released Tuesday and Thursday. Investors will also get the latest data on retail sales. All of this means that August may not be the quiet month that investors have come to expect. But the MarketBeat analysts will keep you on top of the stocks and the stories that are moving the markets. Here are some of our most popular stories from this week. Articles by Thomas Hughes Advanced Micro Devices Inc. NASDAQ: AMD delivered one of the most anticipated earnings reports this week. Thomas Hughes explained why the sell-off after weak guidance is likely due to profit taking, leaving savvy investors with an opportunity to buy the dip in AMD stock. Sticking in the chip sector, Hughes saw a similar pattern in the price action in Onsemi NASDAQ: ON stock as investors initially sold a solid, but not spectacular report. However, Hughes wrote that Onsemi’s bullish guidance will allow its summer rebound to continue. Investors also eagerly awaited the earnings report from Hims & Hers Health Inc. NYSE: HIMS. Hughes explained why weak results temporarily gave short sellers an advantage. However, the long-term outlook for HIMS is favorable, but investors will want to make sure the stock has hit a bottom before buying the dip. Articles by Sam Quirke The performance of Amazon.com Inc. NASDAQ: AMZN stock after its earnings report seems overdone. Sam Quirke explained this week why bearish momentum may be difficult to break after Amazon was such a strong performer heading into earnings. Nevertheless, investors who believe in the company’s long-term growth will likely be rewarded. Despite the company's strong earnings report, Qualcomm Inc. NASDAQ: QCOM stock is down more than 10%. Quirke pointed out old but persistent concerns that could keep pressure on QCOM stock. However, bullish analyst sentiment may reward patient investors. Articles by Chris Markoch Meeting AI's demands will require data centers, and lots of them. This week, Chris Markoch offered investors three companies that will play a key role in the data center buildout wave. These companies help provide the cooling, connectivity, and power that data centers need. It's been a bad month for CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. NASDAQ: CRWD. Markoch pointed out that the company may need a blowout earnings report to reverse the bearish trend. Investors may want to wait for the report before taking a position. Novo Nordisk A/V NYSE: NVO is another stock looking for a bottom. In this case, Markoch pointed investors to the company’s Aug. 6 earnings report as a potential opportunity for NVO to reverse its slide. But even if the company reports solid results, the incoming CEO faces familiar challenges. Articles by Ryan Hasson Growth investors consistently look to the sectors that will drive the market higher in the future, and the companies in a position to capitalize on that growth. This week, Ryan Hasson highlighted five stocks leading the way in sectors like AI, clean energy, and space. Although some of these are household names, Hasson explained why there’s still a long runway for growth-oriented investors. Hasson also looked at three technology stocks that are becoming essential in the buildout of a global AI infrastructure. This sector will play out over the years, giving each of these stocks a long runway for growth. Articles by Gabriel Osorio-Mazilli Hope for the best and plan for the worst is generally good advice. This week, Gabriel Osorio-Mazilli applied that advice to investors in his article on how to invest in this market for the rest of the year. Osorio-Mazilli explained why the trend is for more upside, but there are steps investors can take to hedge against downside risk. Another strategy for investing in volatile markets is to go value hunting. Osorio-Mazilli highlighted three beaten-down stocks that now offer asymmetrical upside potential. One risk of chasing stocks higher was evident in the earnings report from Super Micro Computer Inc. NASDAQ: SMCI. The stock plummeted 17% after a good report that wasn’t good enough for expectations. Osorio-Mazilli broke down the report's elements that should matter to investors and explained why they make this selloff a buyable dip. Articles by Leo Miller Technological shifts create their own language. This week, Leo Miller examined the quiet rivalry between two “hypervisors,” Broadcom Inc. NASDAQ: AVGO and Nutanix Inc. NASDAQ: NTNX. Miller pointed out the key role that VMWare plays in Broadcom’s dominant position and how Nutanix is making inroads that could make NTNX the better long-term play. Meta Platforms Inc. NASDAQ: META continued to push higher a week after its earnings report. Miller highlighted the role of analysts in that move. Multiple upgrades and price target increases signal another 10% upside for META stock. Robinhood Markets Inc. NASDAQ: HOOD has had a rough month. First, the stock was slighted by the S&P 500, and then HOOD stock dipped despite a solid earnings report. Miller explained why investors should be more interested in the recent string of analysts’ upgrades that suggest the dip creates a more attractive upside for the stock. Articles by Nathan Reiff Quantum computing investors know that D-Wave Quantum Inc. NYSE: QBTS is a leader in the annealing technology approach. This week, Nathan Reiff explained D-Wave's push into cryogenic packaging and how it could allow the company to compete with gate-model quantum computing technology, which many tech companies prefer. Timing the market is always tricky. However, there are times when opportunities may be too good to pass up. Reiff explained why that may be the case for three overlooked stocks that are underperforming the S&P 500 but give investors reason to believe in more upside ahead. With so many high-tech themes for investors to track, fund investing makes a lot of sense. This week, Reiff analyzed three exchange-traded funds (ETFs) beating the S&P 500 and giving investors exposure to some of the hottest names in technology, finance, aerospace and defense. Articles by Dan Schmidt Earnings season gives many companies an opportunity to deliver a progress report to investors. Dan Schmidt spotlighted three companies that put up strong numbers this earnings season, which may have investors reconsidering the grade they’ve assigned to the stock. Schmidt also wrote about the ongoing battle between NVIDIA Corp. NASDAQ: NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices. As Schmidt explained, NVIDIA is the clear leader in the GPU market, but the stock looks overvalued. That’s one reason investors are buying AMD stock, which was outperforming NVDA before AMD’s earnings report. Articles by Jeffrey Neal Johnson The emerging electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) sector continues to draw in investors. This week, Jeffrey Neal Johnson wrote about two companies whose stocks were moving higher on bullish news. Industry leader, Joby Aviation Inc. NYSE: JOBY stock soared to an all-time high after the company announced two deals, including its agreement to buy the passenger business of Blade Air Mobility Inc. NASDAQ: BLDE. Johnson also wrote about the new long-term partnership that is taking away a key risk for investors in Vertical Aerospace Ltd. NYSE: EVTL. Specifically, the deal will ensure the company can produce the airframes for its VX4 aircraft at scale. Johnson also explained why, even if you’re not an active trader, you can look at a stock's options activity to find opportunities. That was the case with Applied Digital Corp. NASDAQ: APLD, which had a spike in call options that would have pointed investors to bullish sentiment about the company’s AI pivot. Articles by Jordan Chussler Finance stocks have been strong performers this year. Jordan Chussler pointed out that the sector outperformed the S&P 500 in 2025. That strong performance will continue if and when the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates. Chussler highlighted the Invesco KBW Bank ETF NASDAQ: KBWB. The fund is outperforming the broader sector, making it a strong choice for investors looking for exposure ahead of rate cuts. Before you consider Invesco KBW Bank ETF, you'll want to hear this."

"As electric bills rise, evidence mounts that data centers share blame. States feel pressure to act",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/as-electric-bills-rise-evidence-mounts-that-data-centers-share-blame-states-feel-pressure-to-act-2025-08-08/,"HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Amid rising electric bills, states are under pressure to insulate regular household and business ratepayers from the costs of feeding Big Tech's energy-hungry data centers. It's not clear that any state has a solution and the actual effect of data centers on electricity bills is difficult to pin down. Some critics question whether states have the spine to take a hard line against tech behemoths like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta. But more than a dozen states have begun taking steps as data centers drive a rapid build-out of power plants and transmission lines. That has meant pressuring the nation's biggest power grid operator to clamp down on price increases, studying the effect of data centers on electricity bills or pushing data center owners to pay a larger share of local transmission costs. Rising power bills are “something legislators have been hearing a lot about. It’s something we’ve been hearing a lot about. More people are speaking out at the public utility commission in the past year than I’ve ever seen before,” said Charlotte Shuff of the Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board, a consumer advocacy group. “There’s a massive outcry.” Some data centers could require more electricity than cities the size of Pittsburgh, Cleveland or New Orleans, and make huge factories look tiny by comparison. That's pushing policymakers to rethink a system that, historically, has spread transmission costs among classes of consumers that are proportional to electricity use. “A lot of this infrastructure, billions of dollars of it, is being built just for a few customers and a few facilities and these happen to be the wealthiest companies in the world,” said Ari Peskoe, who directs the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard University. “I think some of the fundamental assumptions behind all this just kind of breaks down.” A fix, Peskoe said, is a “can of worms"" that pits ratepayer classes against one another. Some officials downplay the role of data centers in pushing up electric bills. Tricia Pridemore, who sits on Georgia’s Public Service Commission and is president of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, pointed to an already tightened electricity supply and increasing costs for power lines, utility poles, transformers and generators as utilities replace aging equipment or harden it against extreme weather. The data centers needed to accommodate the artificial intelligence boom are still in the regulatory planning stages, Pridemore said, and the Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech firms and data center developers, has said its members are committed to paying their fair share. But growing evidence suggests that the electricity bills of some Americans are rising to subsidize the massive energy needs of Big Tech as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority. Data and analytics firm Wood Mackenzie published a report in recent weeks that suggested 20 proposed or effective specialized rates for data centers in 16 states it studied aren’t nearly enough to cover the cost of a new natural gas power plant. In other words, unless utilities negotiate higher specialized rates, other ratepayer classes — residential, commercial and industrial — are likely paying for data center power needs. Meanwhile, Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog for the mid-Atlantic grid, produced research in June showing that 70% — or $9.3 billion — of last year's increased electricity cost was the result of data center demand. Last year, five governors led by Pennsylvania's Josh Shapiro began pushing back against power prices set by the mid-Atlantic grid operator, PJM Interconnection, after that amount spiked nearly sevenfold. They warned of customers “paying billions more than is necessary.” PJM has yet to propose ways to guarantee that data centers pay their freight, but Monitoring Analytics is floating the idea that data centers should be required to procure their own power. In a filing last month, it said that would avoid a ""massive wealth transfer” from average people to tech companies. At least a dozen states are eyeing ways to make data centers pay higher local transmission costs. In Oregon, a data center hot spot, lawmakers passed legislation in June ordering state utility regulators to develop new — presumably higher — power rates for data centers. The Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board says there is clear evidence that costs to serve data centers are being spread across all customers — at a time when some electric bills there are up 50% over the past four years and utilities are disconnecting more people than ever. New Jersey’s governor signed legislation last month commissioning state utility regulators to study whether ratepayers are being hit with “unreasonable rate increases” to connect data centers and to develop a specialized rate to charge data centers. In some other states, like Texas and Utah, governors and lawmakers are trying to avoid a supply-and-demand crisis that leaves ratepayers on the hook — or in the dark. In Indiana, state utility regulators approved a settlement between Indiana Michigan Power Co., Amazon, Google, Microsoft and consumer advocates that set parameters for data center payments for service. Kerwin Olsen, of the Citizens Action Council of Indiana, a consumer advocacy group, signed the settlement and called it a “pretty good deal” that contained more consumer protections than what state lawmakers passed. But, he said, state law doesn't force large power users like data centers to publicly reveal their electric usage, so pinning down whether they're paying their fair share of transmission costs ""will be a challenge.” In a March report, the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard University questioned the motivation of utilities and regulators to shield ratepayers from footing the cost of electricity for data centers. Both utilities and states have incentives to attract big customers like data centers, it said. To do it, utilities — which must get their rates approved by regulators — can offer “special deals to favored customers” like a data center and effectively shift the costs of those discounts to regular ratepayers, the authors wrote. Many state laws can shield disclosure of those rates, they said. In Pennsylvania, an emerging data center hot spot, the state utility commission is drafting a model rate structure for utilities to consider adopting. An overarching goal is to get data center developers to put their money where their mouth is. “We’re talking about real transmission upgrades, potentially hundreds of millions of dollars,” commission chairman Stephen DeFrank said. “And that’s what you don’t want the ratepayer to get stuck paying for."" ___ Follow Marc Levy on X at https://x.com/timelywriter.

Retiring and relocating? Take a holistic approach,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/retiring-and-relocating-take-a-holistic-approach-2025-08-08/,"NEW YORK (AP) — Debra Taylor has had a busy year or so: She's going through a divorce while in the process of retiring — and she's moving to Portugal from Southern California with one of her daughters. After deciding her next home would be outside the U.S., she narrowed down her choices based on tax burdens (Spain was out with its wealth taxes), climate (no Costa Rica, too hot) and ease of travel within Europe, one of her favorite parts of the world. She then toured Portugal with a relocation company, Expatsi, and found her new home, Aveiro. It's a striking city on the country's west coast with lovely canals that earned it the nickname the Venice of Portugal. It's all logistics from there. Taylor signed a year lease on an apartment (a requirement for moving forward), hired the company Viv Europe to navigate bureaucracies and paperwork, signed up for the necessary FBI background check and has an appointment in late September to move ahead with visas. Her youngest child gave her the idea to leave the country. “After our current president was elected, my 18-year-old transgender daughter came to me and said, ‘I want to get out of this country ASAP,’” Taylor recalled. “That was just fine with me.” Her oldest daughter, who's 20, will stay in the U.S. to complete college. “None of this means I have to live there forever,” Taylor said. “I’ll use this as my jumping-off point to do more deeper dives, explore the rest of the region. I want to buy a place, but I’m not going to do that until I’m living there and spend more time in different communities.” According to aging and relocation experts, Taylor has made the right decisions. The number of people who relocate upon retirement fluctuates, based on such factors as politics, home affordability and cost-of-living rates. While older adults are less likely to move than younger populations, more than 3 million people age 65 and older relocated within the U.S. in the five years before the coronavirus pandemic, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. As for moving abroad, U.S. politics is now the No. 1 reason cited by people who use Expatsi, the company's co-founder Jen Barnett said. “The one downside is that a lot of countries retirees are interested in don’t want retirees, and that is to say wealthy, English-speaking countries, because they want laborers,” Barnett said. While most U.S. retirees stay put in existing homes and locales, those who want to age in place face mounting challenges, said AARP Vice President Rodney Harrell, who focuses on housing and livable communities. Challenges include rising rents or mortgages, costs for home modifications, and a lack of community support services like adequate health care, reliable utilities and safe environments. “One of the biggest challenges that we have is making sure that we take the future us into account, and not just look at our needs today,"" Harrell said. “Are we driving today? Is our income where it is? Is our spouse and myself healthy right now? How able are we to walk around and use steps, etc.? Things can change.” All of the above is crucial as the U.S. heads into a gray bubble. “We’re going to have more people over 65 than under 18 by 2034. For the first time in U.S. history, we have more older adults than children,” Harrell said. Do you want mountains, an ocean, to be closer to grandkids? Would you like a university town or city, a particular religious institution? Harrell suggests setting clear priorities when planning a relocation. And they should go well beyond those specifications. Taking housing costs into consideration is generally universal, he said, but he urged a more subtle consideration. “What are the neighbors like? Is it an active community, if that’s what you want. Do people keep to themselves more? That social connection is really important, too,” Harrell said. The AARP's livability index scores neighborhoods and communities across the U.S. for the services and amenities that impact older people. It's easily searchable by address, city, state or ZIP code. “Think about all of the things that you might want collectively, and know that there’s no perfect place,” Harrell said. “Once you have those things in mind, you’ll get to the best possible outcome. Every place has trade-offs."" If being close to children and grandchildren is high on the list, set clear expectations about how involved you want to be in such things as child care, said retirement transition planner Elizabeth Zelinka Parsons. Also, chat with adult children before making a move to determine how settled they are themselves. Casey Bowers and her husband, Dave Bowers, recently relocated to Ericeira, northwest of Lisbon on Portugal's beachy Silver Coast. They love it, but it's not all ocean and sun. “We have three adult children and their partners, and one grandbaby with another on the way,” Casey said. “We're very close to our children. Learning the grocery store, getting new cellphones, those are just procedural things, but being away from family — that’s the hardest part.” Sarah Friedell O’Connell, a retirement coach in Boston, looks at relocation this way: “You’re going to get a lot of hours back when you stop your full-time job. What are you going to do with that time?"" As a wealth manager, Chad Harmer has helped dozens of retirees relocate, from Ontario, Canada, to Arizona’s High Desert, from the Boston suburbs to the Carolinas. And he's dealt with some “boomerang” moves back home after grandchildren arrived. “Start with a 'lifestyle audit,' not a tax table,"" he said. “I ask clients to write a perfect Thursday five years from now. Where are they walking? Who are they meeting for coffee? How long is the drive to the grandkids? That exercise surfaces climate preferences, social networks, volunteer hobbies and healthcare priorities long before we argue over property tax millage rates.” He also recommended budgeting for hidden inflators — such as higher insurance premiums in disaster-prone areas and frequent flights to see family — and considering less obvious weather complications, like pollen levels. Parsons, who wrote “Encore: A High Achiever's Guide to Thriving in Retirement,” is a staunch supporter of taking a short-term rental before deciding on a permanent move. “It's tempting to retire where you vacation, but that may not be the greatest idea,” she said. Harmer's rule of thumb: When 80 % of your desired daily routine is achievable in a new location for at least 80 % of the year, you’re in the right ZIP code. “Anything less and you’re probably chasing an Instagram fantasy rather than a retirement reality,” he said."
Acai berry producers are concerned as Trump imposes tariffs on Brazil's exports,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/why-trumps-tariffs-could-be-a-disaster-for-brazils-acai-industry-and-american-consumers-2025-08-08/,"BELEM, Brazil (AP) — When U.S. President Donald Trump imposed tariffs of 50% on Brazilian exports in July, acai producer Ailson Ferreira Moreira felt immediately concerned. After all, who was going to eat all of that Amazon berry, globally famous as a delicious, refreshing and nutritious superfood, if American consumers suddenly could no longer afford it? As the main importer of the Brazilian berry, prices of acai smoothies and bowls look certain to go up in the United States. “The acai that’s all produced here ... If only people here eat it, it’s going to be a lot of acai, right?” Moreira told The Associated Press outside of Belem, an Amazon city of 1.4 million residents that will host this year's U.N. climate summit COP30 climate summit in November. “If there’s too much acai here, people won’t be able to eat it all and the price will drop.” A single full crate of acai sells for around $50 at local markets in Brazil, a price that is now expected to plummet. The U.S. is by far the largest acai importer of a total Brazilian output currently estimated at about 70,000 tons per year. The most vulnerable acai producers in the northern state of Para say they have already been hit by tariffs imposed by the U.S. government, as a surplus of the berry without a clear destination starts to mount only days after the new economic scenario unfolded. More powerful exporters, such as Sao Paulo-state based company Acai Tropicalia Mix, are also feeling the impact. One of its owners, Rogério de Carvalho, told the AP that last year he exported to the U.S. about 270 tons of acai cream — an industrialized version of the berry — ready for consumption. As tariffs started to loom, he said, American importers steered away and clients suspended negotiations. Until the end of July, de Carvalho estimates that his company sold 27 tons to the U.S. “That's 1.5 million Brazilian reais ($280,000) that we lost,” the businessman said. “We are confident there will be a deal between the two countries to allow not only our clients to return, but also getting some new ones.” Trump has linked the higher tariffs on Brazil to the trial of former President Jair Bolsonaro, who is now under house arrest for his alleged role in leading an alleged coup plot to remain in office, despite his election loss to current leftist President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. And despite several Brazilian exports being exempted from the tariffs, acai berries aren't among them. Brazil's industry ministry didn't reply to a request for comment on whether acai berries are among the items that remain on the negotiating table with U.S. trade representatives. Nearly all of the acai consumed in the U.S. originates from Brazil, with the state of Para alone accounting for 90% of the country’s total production. Several communities in the Amazon depend on its harvest. The harvesting of acai is a physically demanding job that requires workers to climb tall trees with minimal safety equipment, and then sliding down branches full of berries to fill baskets and then place them carefully in crates. Analysts say its producers also help protect the rainforest from illegal loggers, miners and cattle ranchers. The night markets of Belem, such as the Ver-o-Peso acai market, are a hub of activity where the freshly harvested berries are brought in by boat and prepared for sale. The Brazilian Association of Fruit and Derivative Producers and Exporters estimates there was an explosive growth of acai exports from Para state, from less than one ton in 1999 to more than 61,000 tons in 2023. Another explosive rise was expected for this year, before the tariffs. On Thursday, Brazil requested consultations at the World Trade Organization over tariffs imposed by the Trump administration against the South American nation that went into effect on Wednesday. That could be took little too late for acai harvester Mikael Silva Trindade, who agrees that the future of the trade is at risk as higher U.S. tariffs can disrupt the delicate balance of supply and demand that holds the industry. “There will be nowhere to market (the excess of acai),” Trindade told the AP as he picked berries in Para state. “The more you export, the more valuable it becomes. But if there’s too much to sell, it will stay here and become cheap.” ___ Mauricio Savarese reported from Sao Paulo. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america"

The company beat on the top and bottom lines with earnings per share (EPS) of $1.03 and revenue of $3.10 billion. Those numbers were year-over-year (YOY) gains of 19% and 12% respectively. But headline numbers show where a company has been, not where it’s going. In the case of Airbnb, the company delivered tepid guidance for the coming quarter. Management’s Q3 revenue guidance of $4.02 to $4.1 billion represents about 8% year-over-year growth, a deceleration from the 12% the company just reported in Q2. It also seems to confirm that the economy may not be as strong as expected and suggests that investors may not want to buy this dip. The July Jobs report released on Aug. 1 challenged the assumption that the U.S. consumer was holding up well. But the performance of consumer discretionary stocks in 2025 has made some investors skeptical of that outlook. A research report from Bank of America (BofA) hints that this may be a time for investors to trust their intuition. In its July Consumer Checkpoint, BofA presented data showing consumer spending on services (including hotels, airfares, and dining) has declined for three straight months. One part of the report noted, “Discretionary services spending, particularly in travel, appears to be contributing negatively to services growth.” Airbnb's chief executive officer (CEO), Brian Chesky, was quick to tell analysts that the company was not satisfied with slow growth, saying, “We want the company to accelerate.” However, it’s fair to say that the call didn’t point to specific initiatives that would make this happen. For example, in discussing the company’s artificial intelligence (AI) investments, Chesky remarked that Airbnb continues “to explore how we can use AI to improve the guest and host experience, but we’re still early in identifying the most impactful use cases.” In discussing the potential opportunity in business travel, the CEO told analysts the company was “looking at ways to make Airbnb more compelling.” There were other examples, but a common theme on the earnings call was one that was non-committal without a product roadmap or a specific strategy outlined. It’s also a reminder that the reason to stay at an Airbnb property is not the same as the decision to buy ABNB stock. Many consumers swear by the home rental model and will never return to a hotel. The model works for many individuals, groups, and families, particularly those for whom the “where” is a key part of their vacation plans. But does that mean ABNB stock is a good investment? Right now, slowing growth shows a mature company finding it tough to innovate. For example, the company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $6 billion, which is generally positive for shareholders. However, at 30x forward earnings, ABNB is valued as a growth stock forecasting high single-digit growth, which makes it appear the company’s best days are behind it. The post-earnings sell-off has given investors the potential for more upside in ABNB stock. The consensus price target of $143.07 provides about 20% upside. However, several analysts have lowered their price targets since earnings. Investors looking to buy the dip may look at a $115 price target, but stronger support is more likely to be around $110 or even $100. But before taking action, investors will want to wait for other signals to confirm. For example, the sharp drop in the stock price pushed the MACD line below the signal line, and the chart shows that momentum is becoming increasingly bearish. The daily volume is more than double the average daily volume, showing that investors are selling first and asking questions later. This means that patience will be required before timing an entry. The 50-day SMA is flattening and starting to curl lower, putting the stock close to a bearish death cross formation that occurs when the 50-day SMA crosses below its 200-day SMA.

Netflix Bulls vs. Bears: Who Wins This Pullback?,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/netflix-bulls-vs-bears-who-wins-this-pullback/,"Shares of streaming giant Netflix Inc NASDAQ: NFLX closed Wednesday just below the $1,180 mark, leaving the stock roughly 15% off its early-July peak. That stumble starkly contrasts with the S&P 500’s nearly 3% gain over the same stretch. The divergence is striking, puzzling, and potentially worrying - all at the same time. It will also be a bitter pill for investors enjoying one of the cleanest multi-year rallies among the big tech names. Still, there are reasons to think we’re looking at a golden entry opportunity. Let’s look at two of the top reasons to be brave and one that says to still be wary. Starting with the fundamentals, last month’s report smashed expectations. Revenue was up nearly 16% yearly, and earnings per share surpassed the consensus. Going further, Netflix’s management shared fresh revenue and EPS guidance that also came in hot - a move that Wall Street usually loves to see. Behind those headline beats were a couple of standout drivers. For example, Netflix’s fledgling advertising segment is scaling faster than many expected, and already appears robust even if it’s still small in the grand scheme of things. The company’s growth across regions was fairly broad, and its dabbling into live streaming appears to be paying off already. These all helped to send the company’s operating margin to a record high of 34%, helped along by solid content cost leverage. It remains one of the world’s most recognizable brands, has proven capable of innovating and pivoting successfully, and is adding subscribers at a considerable clip. For investors who’ve been watching the stock rally for a while and were too cautious to chase an entry, this 15% haircut could be the perfect entry point. Backing up the theory that we could be looking at a golden opportunity is the fact that analyst sentiment remains overwhelmingly bullish. As Bank of America said after the report, “Netflix remains among the best-positioned companies in media and entertainment with sustainable growth drivers that should prove predictable and defensive amid a wide range of macroeconomic scenarios”. And they’re not the only ones. Multiple analysts reiterated positive views after the print, many nudging targets higher to reflect stronger optimism and belief in Netflix’s potential. Robert Baird, for example, reiterated its Outperform rating while upping its price target to $1,500, matching the update from both Needham and Jefferies. Meanwhile, the team at Wells Fargo moved their price target on Netflix up to $1,560—close to a street high. From where the stock closed on Wednesday, that’s not only pointing to a targeted upside of more than 30%, but suggesting Netflix shares could be back cruising through all-time highs very soon. However, it has to be noted that not everyone is convinced that this is a no-brainer. Amidst the gushing analyst support following last month’s report, there was at least one team that raised a big, bright red flag. Phillip Securities downgraded its rating to Strong Sell, arguing that the report wasn’t good enough to justify the rally, and that valuation was becoming a genuine concern. With a pre-earnings report price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of almost 60, compared to the 40 it was around 12 months previously, it’s hard to argue with them. Phillip Securities analyst Helena Wang remains cautious on the company’s long-term growth potential, but feels there’s a much bigger correction needed to get the stock back to a healthy level from which to build again. Her $950 price target is a testament to this, which, even with the 15% drop over the past few weeks, suggests Netflix could easily fall another 20% or so. Wednesday’s 2.7% rise in the stock shows there’s still strong demand, with buyers already stepping in. It looks like an early rejection of the bears’ attempt to push the stock below Tuesday’s low. If Netflix can hold above the $1,150 level through week’s end, expect bearish momentum to fade fast. Before you consider Netflix, you'll want to hear this."

"Trump removes Billy Long as IRS commissioner, giving him the shortest-ever tenure in the role",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-removes-billy-long-as-irs-commisioner-less-than-2-months-after-his-confirmation-2025-08-08/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has removed former U.S. Rep. Billy Long as IRS commissioner less than two months after his confirmation, a White House official said Friday. It was not immediately clear why Long was dismissed. His quick exit makes him the shortest-tenured IRS commissioner confirmed by the Senate since the position was created in 1862. Long said in a social media post that Trump had nominated him for an ambassadorship. “It is a honor to serve my friend President Trump and I am excited to take on my new role as the ambassador to Iceland. I am thrilled to answer his call to service and deeply committed to advancing his bold agenda. Exciting times ahead!” the former Missouri congressman wrote on X. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will serve as acting IRS commissioner, according to the White House official, who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Long’s ouster only compounds the turmoil at the nation’s tax collector, which has been beset by turnover since the beginning of Trump’s second term. The IRS shuffled through four acting leaders before Long was confirmed in June and has lost a quarter of its staff since the Department of Government Efficiency burrowed in in a self-stated mission to reduce waste, fraud and abuse. In a message to IRS employees after he was confirmed, Long talked about his plans for his first few months in office, a milestone he did not reach. ""In my first 90 days I plan to ask you, my employee partners, to help me develop a new culture here,” Long wrote. “I’m big on culture, and I’m anxious to develop one that makes your lives and the taxpayers’ lives better.” In many ways, he was an unusual pick for the role. While in Congress, where he served from 2011 to 2023, Long sponsored legislation to get rid of the IRS. A former auctioneer, Long had no background in tax administration. The Senate confirmed Long on a 53-44 vote despite Democrats’ concerns about the Republican’s past work for a firm that pitched a fraud-ridden coronavirus pandemic-era tax break and about campaign contributions he received after Trump nominated him. After leaving Congress to mount an unsuccessful 2022 bid for the U.S. Senate, Long worked with a firm that distributed the pandemic-era employee retention tax credit. That tax credit program was eventually shut down after then-IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel determined that it was fraudulent. Democrats called for a criminal investigation into Long’s connections to other alleged tax credit loopholes. The lawmakers allege that firms connected to Long duped investors into spending millions of dollars to purchase fake tax credits. The acting Ieaders who preceded Long in the role included one who resigned over a deal between the IRS and the Department of Homeland Security to share immigrants’ tax data with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and another whose appointment led to a fight between former Trump adviser Elon Musk and Bessent. Long's departure comes after the agency underwent a series of DOGE-related job cuts this year. The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration reports that the agency has been cut down from 103,000 workers in January to 77,000 workers in May 2025. Most of the reductions came from DOGE's deferred resignation program. The workforce reductions were part of the Trump administration’s efforts to shrink the size of the federal bureaucracy."

FAFSA application is open for early testing. Here's what to know.,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/fafsa-application-is-open-for-early-testing-heres-what-to-know-2025-08-08/,"NEW YORK (AP) — The Free Application for Federal Student Aid for the 2026-27 school year has opened for a limited number of students as part of a beta test, the Department of Education says. The department is rolling out two beta testing phases before the application is fully available to everyone in October. At first, the FAFSA form will be available for a small number of students and families, chosen via existing partnerships with community organizations and schools. “We're using this time to monitor a limited number of FAFSA submissions to ensure our systems are performing as expected,” the department said on Monday. In September, students will be able to request participation in the second phase of beta testing. Participation will be limited, so not everyone will be accepted, said the Education Department. Here's what you need to know. The FAFSA is a free government application that uses students’ and their families’ financial information to determine whether they can get financial aid from the federal government to pay for college. The application will send a student’s financial information to the schools they are interested in attending. The amount of financial aid a student receives depends on each institution. The application is also used to determine eligibility for other federal student aid programs, like work-study and loans, as well as state and school aid. Sometimes, private, merit-based scholarships also require FAFSA information to determine if a student qualifies. The 2026–27 FAFSA form will be available to everyone by Oct. 1. The deadline to submit the FAFSA form is June 30, 2026. Students can start preparing to fill out the FAFSA now so they can complete it as soon as it’s available. The first step in the process is to create a studentaid.gov account and gather the following documents. —Social Security number —Driver’s license number —Alien registration number, if you are not a U.S. citizen —Federal income tax returns, W-2s and other records of money earned —Bank statements and records of investments —Records of untaxed income Anyone planning to attend college next year should fill out the form. Both first-time college students and returning students can apply for the FAFSA. Students and parents can use the federal student aid estimator to get an early approximation of their financial package. ___ The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

Viasat: Why a Wall of Cash Has Shorts Running for Cover,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/viasat-why-a-wall-of-cash-has-shorts-running-for-cover/,"For months, satellite communications company Viasat NASDAQ: VSAT was a classic battleground stock, attracting a significant number of investors betting against it. A long-standing narrative focused on the company’s heavy debt load and the rising threat of competition. But in a stunning two-day surge, Viasat’s stock price soared over 22% on explosive trading volume, signaling that the tide may be turning. The catalyst was a first-quarter earnings report that not only beat expectations but also challenged the very foundation of the current bearish sentiment. This set off a frantic rally as short-sellers, who had borrowed shares to bet on a price drop, were forced to buy them back. The key question for investors now is whether this was a momentary, technically driven short squeeze or the beginning of a meaningful and sustainable re-rating of a global communications sector powerhouse. The spark that ignited Viasat’s rally was its first-quarter fiscal year 2026 financial report. The company posted a non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $0.17, decisively crushing the Viasat analyst community’s estimates of a $0.15 loss. Revenue also came in strong at $1.17 billion, sailing past forecasts. But the most important number in the report was not about earnings; it was about cash. Viasat generated $60 million in positive free cash flow, a remarkable $210 million improvement year-over-year. Free cash flow, the cash a company produces after accounting for capital expenditures, is a critical indicator of financial health. For a company like Viasat, which operates in a capital-intensive industry and carries substantial debt, this shift is a game-changer. It signals that the period of heavy investment may be cresting, allowing the company to begin harvesting returns, paying down debt, and funding its growth without relying on external financing. This performance was supported by clear evidence of improved capital discipline: This potent combination of growing cash flow and reduced spending directly addresses the primary concern that has weighed on the stock: its $6.7 billion debt load. By demonstrating an ability to generate its funding, Viasat has presented a credible path to deleveraging its balance sheet and achieving greater financial stability. While the market was focused on debt, Viasat’s core business segments were building significant momentum. The recent earnings report has forced investors to recognize the powerful growth engines that form the foundation of the company’s value proposition. The standout performer is Viasat's Defense and Advanced Technologies (DAT) segment. Often described as the company's crown jewel, this division provides secure, high-tech communications for government and military clients. Its latest performance was exceptional: This high-margin defense business offers a stable, expanding revenue base built on long-term government contracts. Its strength is a key reason why activist investors have argued the segment’s actual value is obscured within the larger company. At the same time, Viasat’s commercial aviation business is capitalizing on the global recovery of the travel sector. The in-flight connectivity division saw service revenue grow 14% as more aircraft were equipped with its systems. A new partnership with LATAM Group NYSE: LTM underscores its continued success in securing major, long-term airline contracts, locking in future revenue. With a strong quarter in the books, several key catalysts are on the horizon that could sustain the stock's upward momentum. First is the imminent expansion of its global satellite network. Viasat has confirmed that its ViaSat-3 F2 satellite is expected to ship to the launch site by September 2025. This satellite, covering Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, along with the subsequent Asia-Pacific satellite, will dramatically increase Viasat's available bandwidth. This new capacity will enable it to offer higher speeds and connect more devices simultaneously, opening up new revenue opportunities in its lucrative aviation, maritime, and government markets. Second, the company is nearing the finalization of a settlement with Ligado Networks. Pending court approval, this agreement is expected to provide Viasat with a new, high-margin revenue stream starting with quarterly payments of approximately $16 million. This potential income has not yet been factored into the company's financial guidance, representing a source of future upside. Finally, Viasat has a clear plan to use its financial strength to create a virtuous cycle. Management has stated that its priority is to use its growing free cash flow to pay down debt. This will not only strengthen the balance sheet but also reduce interest expenses, which in turn will free up even more cash for growth and further deleveraging. Viasat's recent rally appears to be more than a temporary, squeeze-driven event. It is rooted in a fundamental improvement in the company's financial trajectory, marked by a decisive turn toward generating, not consuming, cash. Investors are now recognizing the true value of its resilient defense and growing aviation businesses. With major operational catalysts on the horizon and a clear strategy to fortify its balance sheet, the evidence suggests this is the beginning of a durable and positive shift in the Viasat story. Before you consider Viasat, you'll want to hear this."
