With recalibrated growth plans, it has commissioned a 9,000-tonne IHT specialty wire unit, which is likely to achieve 40% utilisation by FY26. It also plans to set-up a 6,000-tonne OHT facility, which is likely to be commercialised by Q3FY27. The company expects Phase-I approval for steel tyre cord from one tyre manufacturer in the next two weeks, while Phase-II field trial is likely to begin soon. This unit is likely to commercialise by mid-FY27 (delay of ~1-2 months due to recent fireincidence at Dadri unit). As major chunk of enhanced capacities is likely to be over in the next two years in phased manner, we have trimmed our EBITDA estimate for FY27/28 by 5.6/8.1% and APAT estimate by 12/14% due to higher depreciation and finance cost. Outlook Considering its presence across steel-wire value chain, focus on high RoCE segments and management’s guidance for surpassing Rs8,000 EBITDA/tonne, we continue to remain positive and retain BUY rating on the stock with a TP of Rs360, valuing it at 1.15x FY28 PEG For all recommendations report, click here Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

Buy JK Cement; target of Rs 7545: Anand Rathi,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-jk-cement-target-of-rs-7545-anand-rathi-13783049.html,"Anand Rathi's research report on JK Cement Notwithstanding weak pricing environment and rising petcoke prices, strong volume growth and cost optimisation measures aided the company’s quarterly performance. While the company is aiming 50m tonne cement capacity by 2030, the announced expansion would take grey cement capacity to 38m tonne by FY28. While net debt is expected to rise due to expansion capex, sales volume is expected to continue to outstrip the industry demand on capacity ramp-up.

"Q3 Results impact: Persistent Systems shares fall 4% despite Q3 net profit rise, SRF tumbles 5% to nine-month low",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/q3-results-impact-persistent-systems-shares-fall-4-despite-q3-net-profit-rise-srf-tumbles-5-to-nine-month-low-13782785.html,"The shares of Persistent Systems dropped more than 4 percent to a near six-week low on January 21 after the company released its results for the October-December quarter of the financial year 2026. Some brokerages remained optimistic and increased their target prices for the stock, while some cited valuation concerns. SRF shares meanwhile tumbled more than 5 percent to trade at a nine-month low of Rs 2,730.10 apiece. Both these companies had released their results in the post-market hours of January 20. Persistent Systems Q3 Results: Persistent Systems reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 439.45 crore for Q3 FY26. This marks an 18 percent year-on-year (YoY) increase from the Rs 372.99 crore net profit reported in Q3 FY25, but 7 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) decline from Rs 471.47 crore reported in Q2 FY26. The net profit reported in the third quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026 however includes 1.8 percent one-time impact due to the new labour codes. The firm’s revenue from operations rose 23 percent YoY to Rs 3,778.2 crore during the quarter under review. “We are also applying Agentic AI within our own operations, as a ‘customer zero’ to improve productivity and speed adoption at scale, an approach further validated by our recognition as a Microsoft Frontier Firm. As we move ahead, our priority remains sustaining growth through consistent execution as demand continues to shift toward larger, more complex engagements,” said Persistent’s CEO Sandeep Kalra. Along with the Q3 results, Persistent Systems announced an interim dividend of Rs 22 per share for the financial year 2026. The record date to determine the eligibility of the shareholders set to receive the payment has been set at January 27. JM Financial on Persistent Systems: JM Financial maintained its ‘Buy’ rating on the stock, and increased its target price to Rs 7,600 per share. This implies an upside potential of nearly 20 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. The domestic brokerage said that the firm reported yet another strong quarter in Q3, with revenue meeting elevated expectations. It added that margins beat expectations materially. “PSYS continues to have a competitive edge and is benefitting from AI-led modernization, adoption and data readiness led demand. Its head start with platforms/tools such as SASVA and iAURA, alongside internal AI-led productivity efforts allows it to present a compelling value proposition on cost and speed of delivery to clients, driving deal momentum in our view,” JM Financial said. Choice Institutional Equities on Persistent Systems: Choice Institutional Equities increased its target price for the stock to Rs 7,000 per share, while maintaining its ‘Add’ rating. This implies an upside potential of more than 10 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. “Despite ongoing macro uncertainty, the company has sustained consistent execution, led by its strengthening product engineering capabilities…enhancing its competitive positioning in enterprise AI,” it said. HSBC on Persistent Systems: HSBC held a ‘Hold’ call for the stock with a target price of Rs 6,560 per share, which implies an upside potential of more than 3 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. The international brokerage reported strong growth in Q3 with further improvement in profitability, the firm said. However, it noted that the market expectations seem to be fully priced in the valuation. Nomura on Persistent Systems: Nomura held a ‘Neutral’ call for the stock, with a target price of Rs 6,100 per share. The international brokerage said that the IT company’s growth was in-line with estimates, and margin beat expectations in Q3 FY26. SRF Q3 Results: SRF reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 432.66 crore for Q3 FY26, marking a 60 percent YoY rise from Rs 271.08 crore reported in Q3 FY25. The firm’s revenue from operations meanwhile gained 6 percent YoY to Rs 3,712.53 crore, missing estimates. Brokerage UBS says SRF's medium‑term growth looks constrained due to elevated refrigerant prices, continued Chinese pricing pressure, ongoing weakness in agri‑chem, and management abandoning its 20 percent specialty‑chem growth target.

The company has consistently seen higher contribution from its own products across regions, which, along with backward integration efforts, has driven faster-than-expected EBITDA margin expansion.

"Asian shares extend selloff, global bond rout stokes fresh anxiety",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/asian-shares-extend-selloff-global-bond-rout-stokes-fresh-anxiety-13782387.html,"Asian stocks extended their losses for a third session on Wednesday, undone by heightened tensions over U.S. threats to acquire Greenland ahead of President Donald Trump's Davos speech, while a global bond rout appeared to slow for now. Fears of offshore selling of U.S. assets - the so-called ""Sell America"" trade that emerged after last year's ""Liberation Day"" tariff announcements in April - gripped markets as Wall Street tumbled over 2% overnight and the U.S. dollar suffered its biggest fall in over a month. That sent investors fleeing to the safety of gold and silver, which both notched record highs. ""The 'sell America' trade was the driving force behind major market moves overnight, as investors looked to reduce exposure to the U.S., seen by many as an unreliable partner pursuing self-defeating policies,"" said Mantas Vanagas, a senior economist at Westpac. Trump, however, doubled down on his rhetoric over Greenland, saying there was ""no going back"" on his goal to control the island, refusing to rule out taking it by force. His threat of tariffs on Europe has also rekindled fears of a global trade war. The European Union will convene an emergency summit in Brussels on Thursday to discuss the matter, with the long-standing U.S.-EU alliance clearly at risk. All eyes are now on the World Economic Forum in Davos where Trump is due to deliver a speech on Wednesday. In early trade, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.3%. Japan's Nikkei slumped 1.2%, down for the fifth straight day. Nasdaq futures and S&P 500 futures advanced 0.2% after Wall Street suffered the biggest daily drop in three months overnight. The S&P 500 lost 2.06% while the Nasdaq Composite tumbled 2.4%. Both EURO STOXX 50 futures and DAX futures fell 0.4%. JAPAN'S BOND ROUT PAUSES FOR NOW The global bond market was still reeling from a brutal selloff, having been caught up in a perfect storm of worries over exposure to U.S. assets and a surge in Japanese government bond yields. Market worries over increased government spending under Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi sent bond yields there skyrocketing to record highs. Investors were trying to catch their breath in early trading. Providing some relief to frayed debt market nerves, the 40-year Japanese government bond yields retreated 6 basis points on Wednesday to 4.145% after surging 26 bps a day earlier to a record high of 4.215%. Liquidity in other tenors remains thin. U.S. Treasury yields were also steady on Wednesday. The benchmark 10-year yield slipped 1 bp to 4.285%, having jumped 7 bp overnight to a five-month high of 4.313% amid the ""Sell America"" fears. Danish pension fund AkademikerPension said on Tuesday it would sell off its holding of U.S. Treasuries, worth some $100 million, by the end of this month, blaming weak U.S. government finances. In the currency markets, the U.S. dollar held steady at 98.56 against its major peers, having dropped 0.5% overnight - the biggest daily fall since early December. The yen was steady at 158.19 per dollar, but lost out on a number of crosses, with the Swiss franc hitting a record high of 200.19 yen. The Bank of Japan meets on Friday and though no rate hike is expected this time, policymakers could flag a tightening as soon as April. Oil prices fell as pressure from geopolitical tensions and an expected build-up in U.S. crude inventories outweighed a temporary halt in output at two large fields in Kazakhstan. West Texas Intermediate crude oil prices for March fell 1.31% to $59.57 a barrel. [O/R] Gold prices rose 0.8% to $4,806 an ounce, a new record high, while silver climbed 0.4% to $95.01, just short of a record top of $95.87 hit on Tuesday."

US Equities (Down) All ​three major Wall Street indexes ended Tuesday with their biggest one-day drops in three months, in a broad selloff triggered by concerns ‌that fresh tariff threats from President Donald Trump against Europe could signal renewed market volatility.

The Dow Jones Industrial ​Average fell 870.74 points, or 1.76%, to 48,488.59. US Bond Yield (Up) Treasuries joined a selloff in global bonds on Tuesday as escalating trade tensions, spurred by proposed US tariffs relating to Greenland, undermined demand for American assets. The yield curve bear steepened as cash trading resumed following a US holiday, with 10- and 30-year yields both climbing three basis points in early Asia trading. Dollar Index (Down) The dollar fell as President Donald Trump continues pushing with his plan on Greenland, sparking risks of a bigger trade rift with Europe. Asian Currencies (Up) Asian Currencies were trading mostly higher in the early trade on Wednesday, with the Thai Baht leading the gainers, followed by Philippines Peso, the South Korean Won, Japanese Won. Crude (Slips) West Texas Intermediate crude oil prices fell on Wednesday as pressure from geopolitical tensions and an expected build-up in U.S. crude inventories outweighed a temporary halt in output at two large fields in Kazakhstan. Gold (Rises) Gold rose to a record high and silver was near an all-time peak as the worsening crisis over Greenland and a meltdown in Japanese government debt supported haven demand. Fund Flow Action Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) continued their selling on January 20, offloading equities worth around Rs 2,938 crore, while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) bought shares worth approximately Rs 3,665 crore.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade HDFC Life Insurance, Mastek, Dalmia Bharat, JK Cement, Lodha Developers, and others on January 21?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-hdfc-life-insurance-mastek-dalmia-bharat-jk-cement-lodha-developers-and-others-on-january-21-13782320.html,"The benchmark indices were caught in a bear trap, with the Nifty 50 falling 1.38 percent on January 20. Market breadth was heavily dominated by bears, with about 2,552 shares declining against 388 rising shares on the NSE. The market may consolidate with a negative bias after decisively breaking below the previous week’s low. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Amol Athawale, VP Technical Research at Kotak Securities Britannia Industries | CMP: Rs 5,884 After the short-term correction in Britannia from higher levels, the downward momentum has stalled and the stock has entered a consolidation phase over the last few sessions. Moreover, the stock is trading near its important demand zone. The structure suggests a revival of the uptrend from current levels in the near future. For traders, Rs 5,660 would be the key support level to watch. Above this level, the uptrend structure could continue towards Rs 6,300. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 6,300 Stop-Loss: Rs 5,660 Oil and Natural Gas Corporation | CMP: Rs 240.39 After the sharp up move over the last couple of sessions, ONGC witnessed profit booking from higher levels. However, closing near the important retracement zone and the short-term moving average suggests a bullish continuation chart structure. Therefore, the stock is likely to resume its uptrend in the coming sessions. For the next few trading sessions, Rs 232 could be the trend-decider level for the bulls. If the stock sustains above this level, a further uptrend towards Rs 257 can be expected. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 257 Stop-Loss: Rs 232 HDFC Life Insurance Company | CMP: Rs 732.1 On the daily timeframe, HDFC Life has been in a downtrend. Therefore, it is currently in oversold territory and is trading near its demand area. The texture of the chart formation and the RSI indicate that the stock is likely to rebound for a new leg of the up move from its demand zone. For positional traders, Rs 705 would be the decisive level. Trading above this level, the uptrend formation may continue towards Rs 785. However, if the stock closes below Rs 705, traders may prefer to exit long positions. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 785 Stop-Loss: Rs 705 Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors Mastek | CMP: Rs 2,223.8 On the daily chart, Mastek has been trending higher for the past one week and has outperformed broader market indices by consistently closing above the previous day’s high over the last three trading sessions, highlighting underlying strength. The stock has already confirmed a breakout from a triangle pattern on the daily chart, which is a positive technical development. Additionally, the Bollinger Bands have begun to expand, indicating an increase in volatility. For now, a sustained move above Rs 2,245 is required for bullish momentum to continue, which could drive prices towards the prior swing high zone of Rs 2,370–2,400, as long as the Rs 2,150 level remains protected on the downside. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,370, Rs 2,400 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,150 Dalmia Bharat | CMP: Rs 2,191.4 Dalmia Bharat has been forming a Cup and Handle pattern since October 2025. In the previous session, the stock gained over 1.5 percent and managed to close near the neckline around the Rs 2,200 level. A sustainable breakout above this zone could pave the way for a fresh rally. The stock continues to form higher highs and higher lows, indicating positive price action. Additionally, the consistent green histogram following a bullish crossover of the MACD provides double confirmation of the bullish outlook. For now, a decisive move above Rs 2,220 may trigger fresh buying interest, which can push prices towards Rs 2,400, the first target as per the length of the handle. On the downside, the Rs 2,110 level is expected to act as key support. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,400 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,110 JK Cement | CMP: Rs 5,891.5 In the previous session, JK Cement gained 1.84 percent, supported by the highest trading volumes seen since September 19, 2025. The stock has consistently held above the prior day’s low for the last five trading sessions, indicating buying from lower levels. Since November 2025, JK Cement has been trading within a rectangular range of Rs 5,361–6,030, suggesting a phase of accumulation. In the previous session, prices attempted a breakout from this range but failed to close above it. The RSI is currently hovering near 55, indicating the absence of a strong trending move. For now, a decisive breakout above Rs 6,030 could trigger fresh upside momentum towards the Rs 6,450 level, with Rs 5,790 acting as an important support. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 6,450 Stop-Loss: Rs 5,790 Aditya Thukral, Founder & Analyst of AT Research & Risk Managers Delhivery | CMP: Rs 384.85 Delhivery exhibited a box pattern, and a breakdown from this pattern was witnessed on January 12, accompanied by rising volumes. The stock is consistently trading below all its major exponential moving averages, namely the 10-day, 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day EMAs, all of which are sloping downwards. An established downtrend is evident, marked by the formation of lower highs and lower lows. Additionally, the stock has recorded its lowest close since July 3, 2025. A continuation of the downtrend is expected following the breakdown from the box pattern. Any minor bounce towards the previous support level of Rs 391 will act as a selling opportunity, as prior supports have turned into resistances. Sell Delhivery Futures on a rise around Rs 391, with a stop-loss at Rs 398, targeting Rs 377 over the next two weeks. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 377 Stop-Loss: Rs 398 Suzlon Energy | CMP: Rs 46.34 Suzlon entered a correction phase after forming a top around the Rs 86 level on September 12, 2024. The stock is consistently trading below all its major exponential moving averages—10-day, 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day EMAs—and has established a clear downtrend with the formation of lower highs and lower lows. Additionally, the stock has closed at its lowest level since June 6, 2024. With prices now moving towards the targets of a bearish flag pattern on the daily chart, and the breakdown occurring with rising volumes, the pace of the downtrend is accelerating due to falling trendlines. This presents a short-selling opportunity in the futures segment. Any minor bounce towards the previous support level of Rs 47.50 should be used as a selling opportunity, as it has now turned into resistance. Sell Suzlon Futures on a rise around Rs 47.50, with a stop-loss at Rs 48.60, targeting Rs 45.20 and Rs 43.50 over the next two weeks. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 45.20, Rs 43.50 Stop-Loss: Rs 48.60 Lodha Developers | CMP: Rs 979.3 Lodha has confirmed a medium-term downtrend with the break of the swing low of Rs 1,035.15, formed during the previous corrective leg. The stock is witnessing another leg of correction after forming a top near Rs 1,530. It is consistently trading below all its major exponential moving averages—10-day, 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day EMAs—all of which are sloping downward. The short-term downtrend has now extended into a medium-term downtrend, marked by lower highs and lower lows. Additionally, the stock has recorded its lowest close since December 29, 2023. The realty sector has remained under pressure and has been one of the biggest losers during the ongoing correction, underperforming for several months. A continuation of the downtrend is expected in this realty stock, given the established medium-term downtrend. Any minor bounce towards the previous support level of Rs 1,003 should be used as a selling opportunity, as prior supports have turned into resistances. Sell Lodha Futures on a rise around Rs 1,003, with a stop-loss at Rs 1,051, targeting Rs 926 over the next three weeks. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 926 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,051"

"Markets at three-month low: Analysts say Bank Nifty may continue to outperform Nifty, cite multiple tailwinds",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/markets-at-three-month-low-analysts-say-bank-nifty-may-continue-to-outperform-nifty-cite-multiple-tailwinds-13781950.html,"The Nifty Bank index has seen some correction in 2026 so far, declining nearly 2 percent after hitting a lifetime high earlier this month. However, the index is still outperforming the broader Nifty 50 index, which dropped more than 4 percent during the same period. Markets experts have highlighted reasons why the sectoral index remains comparatively resilient amid broader downturn in the stock markets, and what lies ahead. The Nifty Bank index fell 0.81 percent to close at 59,404.20 on January 20, extending decline for the second consecutive session. The index had earlier hit a fresh all-time high of 60,437.35 on January 5, before losing stream. Nifty 50 also had hit its lifetime high of 26,373.20 on January 5, before beginning to decline. The index dropped to a three-month low of 25,171.35, before recovering some losses to close at 25,232.50 on Tuesday. Why Bank Nifty shows resilience amid market downturn? Bank Nifty is exhibiting distinct relative outperformance against the broader market, largely driven by the robust momentum in PSU Banks amid strong quarterly earnings and a broad-based positive trend across the sector, said Santosh Meena, Head of Research at Swastika Investmart. Notably, the Nifty PSU Bank index hit a fresh 52-week high of 9,093.65 in the early trading hours of January 20, before erasing all gains and falling more than 1.3 percent. Renewed institutional interest, RBI's support The analyst added that this resilience is further underpinned by renewed institutional interest, as mutual funds identify attractive valuations within the banking space, coupled with the RBI's prudent measures to ensure adequate systemic liquidity. Notably, the Reserve Bank of India delivered four interest rate cuts in 2025, reducing the benchmark repurchase rate by a cumulative 125 basis points. In June last year, the Indian central cut the cash reserve ratio (CRR), which refers to the funds that banks are required to hold, by 100 basis points to 3 percent. ""Given these structural supports, the index is poised to remain range-bound in the near term, likely consolidating within the 58,700–60,400 zone as it digests recent gains and builds a base for the next move,"" according to the analyst. Strong balance sheets The fact that Bank Nifty has been relatively less affected in the face of the market correction is a sign that the banking sector has strong balance sheets, steady credit growth, as well as greater earnings visibility, said Pranav Koomar, Founder and CEO of PlusCash. He however cautioned investors, stating that some correction cannot be ruled out, especially in case the general market slide continues. “Nonetheless, any fall in Bank Nifty will probably be more limited in extent, except in case of a drastic macro or liquidity surprise,” he added. Harshal Dasani, Business Head at INVasset PMS, meanwhile said that the relative resilience of the index so far reflects composition rather than immunity. “Unlike the Nifty 50, which has meaningful exposure to global cyclicals and rate-sensitive pockets, this index is tilted toward businesses with steadier cash flows, lower balance-sheet stress, and more domestic demand visibility. That has helped cushion volatility even as the broader market corrected,” he said. Going ahead, the divergence may narrow, but not necessarily through a sharp drawdown, the analyst said. “If global cues remain mixed and earnings momentum softens, some mean reversion is possible. However, a decline matching the Nifty 50 would typically require either earnings downgrades or a macro shock, neither of which is clearly visible yet. In a sideways or mildly corrective market, such indices tend to consolidate rather than correct aggressively. Resilience may moderate, but a one-to-one fall with the benchmark is not a base-case scenario at this stage,” he added. Technical view on Bank Nifty Bank Nifty is still holding its major support zone near 58,650, while Nifty has already broken its crucial support of 25,350–25,400, turning structurally weak, said Drumil Vithlani, Technical Analyst at Bonanza. He added that Bank Nifty remains in a sideways-to-positive range, whereas Nifty has shifted to a clear short-term downtrend after rejection from all-time highs. Bank Nifty is trading near/above its 20-week EMA, showing demand at lower levels, while Nifty has closed below its key EMA, indicating selling pressure, he added. RSI of Bank Nifty is healthier and holding above neutral, whereas Nifty’s RSI is weakening, confirming relative underperformance, he further said. The analyst concluded that Bank Nifty is consolidating and showing resilience, supported by PSU banks, while Nifty has already broken key supports and looks comparatively weaker. Bank Nifty continues to show relative outperformance, maintaining a bullish structure despite mild resistance near 60,200, said Emkay Global Financial Services. A sustained move above this level may fuel further upside, while the 59,200–58,900 zone is expected to act as a strong support cushion, the brokerage said. Axis Securities meanwhile said that Bank Nifty is centered around the 60,000 level, which is acting as a key pivot for the current expiry. 59,500 is a strong support zone, supported by heavy Put open interest, while 60,000 remains the major resistance, marked by the highest Call open interest, according to the domestic brokerage. ""Bank Nifty exhibited relative resilience near 59,800–60,000, but hesitation around 60,000 underscores indecision in the banking complex. A break above 60,000 could revive short-term bullish sentiment, while a breach of 59,500–59,600 might signal extended consolidation,"" said Choice Broking."
"Q3 Results impact: Havells India shares drop 7% as profit misses estimates; Aarti Surfactants, Tips Music jump up to 20%",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/q3-results-impact-havells-india-shares-drop-7-as-profit-misses-estimates-aarti-surfactants-tips-music-jump-up-to-20-13781861.html,"The shares of Havells India declined in trade sharply on January 20 after the company’s results for the October-December quarter of FY26 missed estimates on some fronts. Aarti Surfactants and Tips Music shares meanwhile surged. The three companies had released their results on January 19. Havells India Q3 Results: Havells India shares declined more than 7 percent to close at Rs 1,344.90 apiece. This comes a day after the company reported a standalone net profit of Rs 301.36 crore for Q3 FY26, marking a nearly 7 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise from Rs 282.81 crore in Q3 FY25 but a 5 percent QoQ decline from Rs 317.48 crore in Q2 FY26. The firm’s revenue from operations meanwhile rose more than 14 percent YoY to Rs 5,573.44 crore during the quarter under review. Along with the Q3 results, Havells India announced an interim dividend of Rs 4 per equity share. The record date to determine the eligibility of the shareholders set to receive the payment has been set on January 23. The dividend will then be paid to the eligible shareholders on or before February 17. Brokerages on Havells: Motilal Oswal reiterated its 'Neutral' rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,590 apiece. This implies an upside potential of nearly 10 percent from the stock’s previous closing price of Rs 1447.1 apiece. The domestic brokerage said that the company’s Q3 results came in below its estimates, as margins remained under pressure across the C&W, Lloyd, and cable segments. “Going forward, the inventory situation of RAC, the implementation of price hikes due to new BEE norms, RM cost inflation, and growth in the C&W segment amid copper price fluctuations will be the key monitorables,” it added. JM Financial said that the firm’s adjusted PAT was a “shade below expectations”, while EBITDA was in-line and revenue was above estimate. “Our FY26E EPS estimate goes up by 3%, primarily on the back of an increase in revenue from C&W, while our FY27/28E EPS estimate is largely unchanged. We maintain BUY with a PT of INR 1,750 (unchanged), valuing Havells at 50x Dec’27E EPS,” the brokerage said. Nomura kept a ‘Buy’ call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 1,798 per share. This implies an upside potential of more than 24 percent from the stock’s previous closing price of Rs 1,447.1 apiece. The international brokerage said that the firm’s Q3 earnings beat Jefferies kept a ‘Hold’ call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 1,555 per share. This implies an upside potential of nearly 7.5 percent over the stock’s previous closing price. The international brokerage said that the firm’s strong cables and wires growth offset weakness in Lloyd & Lighting. Rising copper and aluminium prices may require calibrated price hikes, it added. Aarti Surfactants Q3 Results: Aarti Surfactants shares jumped 20 percent to hit the upper circuit at Rs 459.10 apiece on Tuesday. This comes after the firm’s net profit grew 358 percent YoY to Rs 3.66 crore in Q3 FY26, from Rs 79.75 lakh in Q3 FY25. The firm’s revenue from operations meanwhile grew around 28 percent YoY to Rs 207.79 crore during the quarter under review. Tips Music Q3 Results: Tips Music shares rose more than 3 percent to close at Rs 536.10 apiece after the company. This came after the company’s net profit rose nearly 37 percent YoY to Rs 58.66 crore in Q3 FY26, from Rs 44.23 crore in Q3 FY25. The firm’s revenue from operations meanwhile rose over 21 percent YoY to Rs 94.29 crore during the quarter under review."

Click to View More Outlook for January 21 Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities Bears resumed control as bulls were increasingly marginalised amid ongoing transatlantic trade tensions. Supports looked fragile as the Nifty kept breaking them on the back of strong institutional selling. Indicators remained in a bearish crossover and are approaching the oversold zone. On the daily chart, the index appears to be drifting towards the 200-DMA. Immediate support is seen around 25,100–25,150. If this level holds, a decent pullback can be expected. Rajesh Bhosale, Equity Technical Analyst, Angel One On the weekly expiry day, Nifty began on a negative note and as prices broke below key support levels, a cascading sell-off ensued, leading to sharp declines through the session. Eventually, Nifty ended the day with a loss of 1.38%, closing tad above the 25200 mark. Over the last 15 days, Nifty has erased more than 1,100 points and in the process has broken multiple key support levels, indicating that weakness may persist in the near term. On the daily chart, prices have slipped below the November swing low and also closed below the golden retracement level (61.8%) of the entire upmove from the September swing low near 24600. On the indicators front, the RSI Smoothened has entered the oversold zone below 25 for the first time since August; however, considering the broad-based nature of the sell-off, attempting to catch the bottom may be premature. From a levels perspective, prices are now at a knocking distance of the long-term 200-DSMA, with 25100–25000 emerging as a crucial support zone for the coming sessions. On the flip side, given the sharpness of the recent decline, identifying a precise resistance zone is challenging; nevertheless, the 25500–25600 region is likely to act as a stiff hurdle. While oscillators are deeply oversold and prices have approached long-term support levels ahead of the key Budget session, we would prefer to remain cautious and not rush to call a bottom until clear reversal signals or a base formation emerge.

"Broader markets extend losses, fall up to 3%: Nifty Midcap 100 goes below 100-DMA; Ola, Oberoi Realty among top losers",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/broader-markets-extend-losses-fall-up-to-1-7-nifty-midcap-100-goes-below-100-dma-ola-oberoi-realty-among-top-losers-13780937.html,"The broader markets extended their losses in Tuesday’s session, mirroring the decline in the benchmark indices, Sensex and Nifty. The Nifty Midcap 100 and Nifty Smallcap 100 underperformed the frontline indices, falling by up to 3 percent, while the benchmark Sensex and Nifty also traded lower. The Nifty Midcap 100 slipped below its 100-day moving average (DMA) to 57,898.65 during intraday trade, with Oberoi Realty and UPL emerging as the biggest laggards. Shares of real estate companies declined sharply on Monday, led by losses in Oberoi Realty, as investor sentiment turned weak following the company’s Q3 earnings. Oberoi Realty reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 622.64 crore for the October–December quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026. This represented a marginal year-on-year increase of 0.69 percent from Rs 618.38 crore reported in Q3 FY25, but an 18 percent quarter-on-quarter decline from Rs 760.26 crore recorded in the previous quarter (Q2 FY26). The Nifty Smallcap 100 index extended its losing streak for a third consecutive session, falling over 4 percent during the period. Newgen Software Technologies, Data Patterns (India), Ola Electric Mobility and Aditya Birla Real Estate emerged as major laggards in the index, with their shares declining by as much as 12 percent. Shares of Ola Electric Mobility slipped 5.5 percent to Rs 33.7, hitting their lowest level in nearly a month, after the electric vehicle maker announced the resignation of its Chief Financial Officer Harish Abichandani due to personal reasons. The company said Deepak Rastogi has been appointed as the new CFO with effect from January 20. The stock marked its tenth consecutive session of decline and has fallen 57.7 percent so far in 2025. N ArunaGiri, CEO of TrustLine Holdings, said ""It has been a one-way fall for the small-cap index since the start of November last year. At the index level, small caps are down over 11.5% since then. That alone looks painful, but the reality beneath the surface is far worse. Even in the current month, from January 1st, the small-cap index has fallen by about 7.5%. And this is only the aggregate picture. When we go deeper, the stock-specific carnage is severe. A large number of stocks are down 40–50%. In fact, one could argue that nearly half the market, particularly across the small-cap spectrum, has seen drawdowns of this magnitude."" ""The pain in mid caps is equally intense. Given the extent of the fall and the brutality of the correction, the obvious question arises: Has this become a buy-on-dips market? Unfortunately, the answer is no. Valuations remain meaningfully above historical averages. Before this correction, the small-cap index was trading at around 28–30x trailing earnings. Post the fall, valuations have moderated to about 25–26x, but this is still a huge premium to long-term averages. So at a broader market level, small and mid caps continue to look expensive, and it would be naïve to rule out more pain in the space. Does that mean investors should simply sit on the fence and wait for much lower levels? That approach is equally not prudent. At the stock-specific level, for truly bottom-up and selective investors, many compelling opportunities are emerging across small and mid caps, provided one is extremely choosy. In that sense, this is not a universal buy-on-dips market, nor is it a market to completely stay out of. It is a market that rewards selective bottom-up stock-specific approach. That, in essence, is the story emerging from the current small- and mid-cap carnage. Time to be choosy, selective and bottom-up,"" he added. Extending its previous day's decline, the Sensex tumbled 1,065.71 points, or 1.28 percent to settle at 82,180.47. During the day, it dropped 1,235.6 points, or 1.48 percent to 82,010.58. The Nifty tanked 353 points, or 1.38 percent to end at 25,232.50, marking its steepest single day decline since April 7, 2025. The sharp fall dragged the index to its lowest closing level since October 15, 2025.

A sustained move above this level may fuel further upside, while the 59,200–58,900 zone is expected to act as a strong support cushion, the brokerage said. Axis Securities meanwhile said that Bank Nifty is centered around the 60,000 level, which is acting as a key pivot for the current expiry. 59,500 is a strong support zone, supported by heavy Put open interest, while 60,000 remains the major resistance, marked by the highest Call open interest, according to the domestic brokerage. ""Bank Nifty exhibited relative resilience near 59,800–60,000, but hesitation around 60,000 underscores indecision in the banking complex. A break above 60,000 could revive short-term bullish sentiment, while a breach of 59,500–59,600 might signal extended consolidation,"" said Choice Broking.

Buy Nuvoco Vistas Corporation; target of Rs 443: Prabhudas Lilladher,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-nuvoco-vistas-corporation-target-of-rs-443-prabhudas-lilladher-13781092.html,"Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Nuvoco Vistas Corporation Nuvoco Vistas (NUVOCO) reported an inline operating performance in Q3FY26, supported by decent volume growth of 7% YoY. Pure cement realizations declined 5.3% QoQ mainly due to weak prices in the eastern region. Raw material costs remained elevated despite access to better-priced slag under long-term contracts, while power and fuel costs declined 9% YoY, aided by higher share of domestic coal in the mix. Consequently, EBITDA/t increased 39% YoY to Rs763 (vs. PLe of Rs775). While the recent uptick in pet coke prices poses a risk to margins in Q4FY26, management expects overall fuel costs to remain largely stable, aided by higher domestic coal usage, while cement price hikes implemented in January are holding so far amid improving demand. The Vadraj acquisition remains on track, with commissioning expected by Q1FY28, taking Nuvoco’s total cement capacity to ~35mtpa. Outlook We raise our EBITDA estimates by 2% on slightly higher volumes and expect it to deliver EBITDA CAGR of 19% over FY25-28E. The stock is trading at EV of 8.2x/6.8x FY27E/FY28E EBITDA.

Domestic W&C business grew by 59% YoY, Wires grew by ~70% and cables grew by ~50%. Wires grew on account of low base, channel restocking amid elevated copper prices and market share gains. The company's international business grew by 5% YoY in Q3FY26 and contributed 6.0% to the total revenue. W&C capacity utilization stood at early 80% in Q3FY26. EBITA margin was temporarily affected due to high A&P expense and one-off on account of gratuity provisioning on implementation of the new labor code.

Overall cargo volume growth was supported by strong throughput at South West Port and Dharamtar, along with interim operations at Tuticorin and the JNPA liquid terminal, partly negated by lower iron ore and coal volumes at Paradip. Port EBITDA/t moderated as a higher share of volumes came from terminals having lower pricing.

Despite having negative seasonality in Capco, the organic growth (0.6% QoQ CC) was positive and multi-faceted across business units, including Fin. Services. However, the organic growth momentum is less likely to sustain in Q4 due to execution deferment in one of the large deals, especially the NN component. The softness in business is also baked into Q4 organic guidance of -1.5 to +0.5 QoQ CC (our assumption), which translates to twomonth inorganic contribution of +1.5% QoQ. Again, the organic guidance comes at the back of improving Capco seasonality in Q4, which is little discouraging. Although 9MFY26 large deals (+77% YoY) and bookings (+25% YoY) have improved, the execution remains a challenge. On the margins front, we expect the full integration of Harman will dilute Service margins in FY27 before it sees integration benefits achieved in FY28E. Outlook We are baking in revenue growth of -1.3%/+3.8/4.4% YoY CC, while keeping our Adj. IT Service margin estimates at 17.4%/17.1%/17.5% for FY26E/FY27E/FY28E, respectively.

The organic Service business grew 1.0% QoQ CC, while organic Auto business de-grew ~4-5% QoQ CC (our assumption). The engagement within Aerospace is progressing well and moving upstream to complex engineering activities, it now anticipates Aerospace to become USD40m revenue in FY26. The management was confident of reversing Q3 weakness and deliver double-digit growth in Q4 on the back of stabilizing operations of its Anchor account along with a ramp up in Auto programs (signed in Q3). The continued momentum in Aerospace & IHM, securing large program on full-vehicle development, and early signs of spending recovery in auto OEMs give confidence to the management to drive double-digit organic growth in FY27. However, we believe the high base in Q4 and the lumpiness in Tech Solutions pose incremental risks to achieving doubledigit growth, especially as the auto recovery remains in limbo. The BMW JV is progressing well and deployed 1000+ employees, adding further visibility for next year. Our organic growth for FY27/FY28 revised to 8.5%/11.9% (earlier 7.5%/12.9%) YoY CC.

BHEL delivered a revenue growth of 16.4% YoY with EBITDA margin expanding by 225bps YoY aided by lower other expenses (vs higher base in Q3FY25) partially offset by decrease in GM. Execution in the Power segment remained slower, translating into ~13% YoY revenue growth despite a healthy Rs1.7trn order backlog, supported by recent Rs66.5bn EPC package win (1×800MW) from NTPC, reinforcing BHEL’s positioning in the thermal space. In contrast, the industry segment continued to deliver strong execution with revenue up 27.4% YoY, driven by accelerating traction across transmission, transportation, oil & gas and defense verticals; however, order inflows in Industry moderated sharply to Rs16.3bn (vs. ~Rs57bn in Q3FY25 on a high base).

Beyond selective pockets the growth was muted, especially BFSI and CMT verticals. The deal signing activities remain strong in these verticals, it will take few more quarters to achieve the normalized revenue run-rate for top marquee accounts. Although top 5/10 accounts de-grew 2.9%/1.1% TTM (vs decline of 5.2%/2.2% LQ), the pace of deceleration has reduced sequentially, implies recovery post productivity benefits. The management was confident of executing even better and aspired to achieve near to double-digit YoY growth in Q4. The company’s participation in vendor consolidation deals along with continued momentum in NN wins translate to a better growth visibility. The recent Indialed NN deal (CBDT) would itself contribute ~80-90bps to the topline in FY27.

Real estate stocks see worst day in six months; Oberoi Realty falls 9% over weak Q3 results: What lies ahead?,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/oberoi-realty-stock-falls-7-over-weak-q3-results-real-estate-index-falls-12-in-10-sessions-what-lies-ahead-13780917.html,"The shares of real estate companies declined in trade sharply on January 20, led by losses in Oberoi Realty as sentiment turned sour after the company’s Q3 results. The sharp fall in the share prices pushed the Nifty Realty index down more than 4 percent to 798.90, as seen at 1.50 pm, to emerge as the top sectoral loser today and recording decline for the third consecutive session. The sectoral index has now fallen for nine out of 10 sessions, dropping more than 13 percent during the period. The sectoral index is set to record the sharpest single-day plunge since July 2025. Oberoi Realty Q3 Results: Oberoi Realty on Monday reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 622.64 crore for the October-December quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026. This marked a marginal rise of 0.69 percent from the Rs 618.38 crore net profit reported in Q3 FY25, but an 18 percent QoQ fall from the Rs 760.26 crore net profit reported in the previous quarter (Q2 FY26). The firm’s revenue from operations meanwhile rose 6 percent YoY but fell more than 16 percent QoQ to Rs 1,492.64 crore during the quarter under review. Along with the Q3 results, Oberoi Realty announced a third interim dividend of Rs 2 per equity share for the financial year 2025-2026. The record date to determine the eligibility of the shareholders set to receive the payment has been set at January 23. The dividend will be paid to the eligible shareholders on or before February 5. ""In 2026, we will continue to actively pursue attractive land opportunities, and we remain optimistic about the year ahead, supported by a strong development pipeline, prudent capital management, and our unwavering focus on creating future ready projects aligned with long-term market demand,"" said Vikas Oberoi, Chairman & Managing Director of Oberoi Realty. JP Morgan remains 'Overweight' on the stock, with a target price of Rs 2,050 apiece which implies an upside potential of nearly 24 percent from the stock's previous closing price. The international brokerage said that the numbers are relatively weak. If pre-sales numbers continue to disappoint, the stock's outperformance could narrow, the firm added. Top realty losers today: Oberoi Realty shares were the top loser on the index, dropping around 9 percent to trade at Rs 1,510.90 apiece. Sobha, Prestige Estates and Macrotech Developers (Lodha) shares meanwhile fell around 6 percent each. Heavyweight Godrej Properties and DLF shares dropped around 5 percent and 3 percent, respectively. Anant Raj and Phoenix Mills shares fell around 3 percent each. Brigade Enterprises and Signature Global shares were trading in the red with marginal losses. What lies ahead? Indian IT sector has seen mass layoffs last year, which have now spilled over to this year. According to analysts, the IT layoffs have impacted housing demand in key areas, thereby impacting the stocks. IT layoffs are likely to be the major reason for the low demand in the luxury segment of urban centers like Bangalore and Hyderabad as they will be discouraging the high-income buyers, said Shashank Gupta, Director, RPS Group. He added that mid-to-premium housing sales, which have already dropped 15 percent year-on-year, will continue to be affected negatively as the professionals will not be willing to upgrade, opting instead to rent amid such job uncertainties. ""The market has whispered to the executives with Nifty Realty down by 20% from the peaks and talking about the disruption posed by the AI, which also indicates that 30% of the IT jobs that are luxury demand would get stifled due to the automation by 2027. The stock corrections that are expected to be around 5-7% are dependent on the RBI rate cuts and policy revamps that could fuel the market by the second quarter of 2026,"" the analyst said. Keshav Mangla, GM Business Development at Forteasia Realty, cited Anarock data to explain that financial tech layoffs of more than 1 lakh since 2024 have already resulted in a 12 percent drop in the demand for Tier-1 cities, thus resulting in developers' difficulties in managing cash flows and having to sell off their inventory.

The growth was broad-based across verticals, except BFSI (down 6.3%) on account of passing productivity benefits. Although Comviva seasonality contributed notably in Q3, the growth beyond Comms was encouraging (+1.2% QoQ), reported third consecutive quarter of growth. Management was confident of sustaining momentum within Comms in FY27, backed by NN 5-year strategic win (USD500m) with a European Telco that itself will contribute ~1% to the topline. The 9MFY26 deal TCV looks encouraging at USD2.7b (+44% YoY), which is coming over and above 42% YoY TCV growth delivered in FY25. The quarterly TCV run-rate of USD800m-USD1b is likely to be sustained, which is sufficient to achieve its aspiration of outpacing the peer average topline growth. We believe the restructuring exercise has largely calibrated margins to a comfort band, now it requires paddling more on the orchestrated large wins.

PAT stood at INR 31,450 mn, down 3.6% QoQ and 6.6% YoY, below our estimate of INR 31,976 mn (–1.6% miss), impacted by weaker operating performance and higher effective tax outgo; PAT declined sequentially despite stable other income. PAT margin came at 13.2%, down 106 bps QoQ and 179 bps YoY, below our estimate of 14.1%, reflecting operating margin pressure and elevated cost structure.

Buy LTIMindtree; target of Rs 7375: Anand Rathi,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-ltimindtree-target-of-rs-7375-anand-rathi-13780724.html,"Anand Rathi's research report on LTIMindtree Despite furloughs, LTIMindtree (LTIM) delivered a solid performance in Q3FY26, with CC revenue rising by 2.4% q/q to $1.21bn and EBIT margin expanding by 20bps q/q to 16.1% LTIM saw a one-time labourcode impact of Rs5.9bn. LTM TCV came in at $1.69bn (up 0.6% y/y) with a book-to-bill of 1.4x, while the LTM TCV stood at $6.5bn (up 12% y/y), driven by multi-year wins across managed services, modernisation, cyber, data, AI and AI-agent deployments, as the clients consolidate spend into fewer strategic partners and fund ‘run + modernize’ programs alongside targeted AI-led transformation. Whilst the growth was broadbased, it was skewed to Manufacturing & Resources (up 9.4% q/q) and Healthcare & Public Services (up 9.9%), with Europe (up 3.4%) and RoW (up 14.1%), driven by execution and wallet share gain in select pockets. Top 5 client headwinds are largely a productivity-cycle issue that should bottom out by Q4FY26, setting up a more growth-oriented mix. Outlook Thus, once that drag fades, vendor consolidation becomes a walletshare opportunity rather than a risk.

Buy JK Cement; target of Rs 7200: Choice Institutional Equities,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-jk-cement-target-of-rs-7200-choice-institutional-equities-13780624.html,"Choice Institutional Equities's report on JK Cement We maintain our BUY rating on JKCE, with a target price of INR 7,200. Key pillars of our investment thesis are: 1) Cement sector tailwinds, such as better demand and healthy pricing heading into Q4 and FY27, 2) Capacity expansion plan is on track with a potential to reach ~36+ Mnt by FY27 end (~28.7 Mnt as of December 2025 ), 3) Commitment to costefficiency through increasing adoption of green power, targeting 75% by FY30, 4) Disciplined leverage strategy, with net debt to EBITDA well below 2x and 5) ROCE expansion of ~495 bps over FY25–28E under reasonable operational assumptions. We employ a robust EV to CE (Enterprise Value to Capital Employed) based valuation framework, which allows us a rational basis to assign a valuation multiple which captures improving fundamentals. Outlook We arrive at a 1-year forward TP of INR 7,200/share for JKCE. We assign an EV/CE multiple of 3.7x/3.7x for FY27E/FY28E, which we believe is conservative, given expansion in ROCE from 11.2% in FY25 to 16.1% in FY28E. We did a sanity check of our EV/CE TP using implied EV/EBITDA, P/BV and P/E multiple. On our TP of INR 7,200 FY28E implied EV/EBITDA/PB/PE multiple is 17.3x/5.5x/31.2x.

"LTIMindtree shares crash 6% after Q3 results; brokerages flag margin risks, near-term earnings concerns",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/ltimindtree-shares-crash-6-after-q3-results-brokerages-flag-margin-risks-near-term-earnings-visibility-13780450.html,"Shares of LTIMindtree Ltd fell sharply in early trade on Tuesday, slipping over 6 percent, as investors reacted to mostly cautious brokerage reviews following the company’s Q3 FY26 results. Analysts flagged concerns around margins and near-term earnings visibility despite largely in-line performance. The stock was trading at Rs 6,012.5 in morning deals, down 6.2 percent on the day. Over the past one year, LTIMindtree shares have gained just over 3 percent, significantly underperforming the benchmark Nifty 50, which is up about 9 percent over the same period. Brokerages said that LTIMindtree delivered an in-line quarter, but diverged on the outlook and valuation comfort. CLSA reiterated its ‘Outperform’ rating with a target price of Rs 7,067 per share, implying an upside of over 17 percent. The brokerage expressed confidence in the company’s guidance for a return to double-digit revenue growth by Q4 FY26. CLSA pointed out strong large deal wins across BFSI, public markets, and consumer and media segments, noting that deal ramp-ups should offset productivity gains from AI adoption. However, it flagged limited scope for near-term re-rating, arguing that future upside will be driven primarily by EPS growth rather than valuation expansion. Morgan Stanley maintained an ‘Equal-weight’ stance with a target price of Rs 6,300, citing positives such as growth in a top hi-tech client and signs of BFSI bottoming out. At the same time, it cautioned that near-term margin pressure remains a concern, resulting in a balanced risk-reward at current valuations. More cautious views came from Nomura and Citi. Nomura retained a ‘Neutral’ rating with a target price of Rs 5,900, pointing to a Q3 performance ranging from in-line to a modest miss, with EBIT margin at 16.1 percent coming in below estimates. It also flagged the one-time labour law provision of Rs 590 crore as a key drag. Citi, which has a ‘Sell’ call and a target price of Rs 5,415, said revenue was aided by seasonal pass-throughs and margins benefited from lower SG&A expenses, but warned that upcoming wage hikes could dent margins by around 100 basis points over Q4 and Q1. LTIMindtree on Monday reported a 12 percent year-on-year decline in net profit to Rs 960 crore for the December quarter, largely due to a one-time labour code-related charge of Rs 590.3 crore. Sequentially, profit fell over 30 percent. Revenue rose 11 percent year-on-year to Rs 10,781 crore, while operating margin improved 20 basis points sequentially to 16.1 percent. Excluding the labour code impact, net profit would have grown 29 percent year-on-year, the company said. Management commentary remained constructive, with CEO and MD Venu Lambu highlighting strong deal momentum, AI-led strategy execution, and a third consecutive quarter of over 2 percent sequential growth.

"Hindustan Zinc shares jump 5% as soaring silver prices boost Q3 results: Should you buy, sell or hold?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/hindustan-zinc-shares-jump-2-as-soaring-silver-prices-boost-q3-results-should-you-buy-sell-or-hold-13780404.html,"The shares of Hindustan Zinc rose more than 5 percent to fresh record high on January 20 as brokerages issued positive notes for the Vedanta Group company after it released results for the third quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026. The shares of the company hit a new 52-week high of Rs 696.90 apiece in the morning trading hours of Tuesday. Hindustan Zinc Q3 results: Hindustan Zinc on January 19 reported a standalone net profit of Rs 3,879 crore for the October-December quarter of FY26. This marked a 46.5 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise from the Rs 2,647 crore net profit reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year. Revenue from operations meanwhile rose 27.5 percent YoY to Rs 10,922 crore during the quarter under review, as against a revenue of Rs 8,556 crore in the year-ago period. EBITDA increased 34.7 percent YoY to Rs 6,055 crore, while EBITDA margin expanded to 55 percent from 52 percent a year ago, supported by lower zinc cost of production and improved operating leverage. According to the company, Q3 marked its highest-ever quarterly revenue and profit, driven by higher metal production, stronger zinc and silver prices, and a sharp reduction in costs. Soaring silver prices: Silver prices hit fresh lifetime highs today, as tensions between US and EU simmered over President Donald Trump’s constant threats to annex Greenland. Silver futures with March expiry gained around 3 percent to hit a fresh all time high of Rs 3,18,729 per kilogram. The future contracts with May and July expiries meanwhile rose more than 3 percent to hit fresh lifetime highs of Rs 3,28,854 per kilogram and Rs 3,35,885 per kilogram, respectively. Hindustan Zinc is the largest producer of silver in India, and produces refined silver with a minimum 99.9 percent purity. HSBC on Hindustan Zinc: HSBC kept a ‘Buy’ call on the shares of Hindustan Zinc, with a target price of Rs 750 per share. This implies an upside potential of nearly 14 percent from the stock’s previous closing price of Rs 660.4 apiece. The company’s Q3 earnings beat estimates due to higher volumes and lower costs, HSBC said. It added that strong silver prices should further lift earnings. The firm expects Q4 results to be even stronger due to higher volumes and sharply higher silver prices. Jefferies on Hindustan Zinc: Jefferies raised its target price for the stock to Rs 750 per share, while maintaining its ‘Buy’ rating. The latest target price implies an upside potential of nearly 14 percent from the previous closing price. The international brokerage said that the firm benefitted from rising silver and zinc prices. It raised FY26-28 EPS estimates by 3–10 percent, as costs remain under control. It expects the company to post 47 percent YoY EPS Growth in FY27, followed by 6 percent In FY28. Jefferies further said that Hindustan Zinc’s valuation at 9.4x FY27 EV/EBITDA as against a long-term average of 7.3x is justified by rising silver share in EBIT. Citi on Hindustan Zinc: Citi however kept its ‘Sell’ call on the stock with a target price of Rs 585 per share, which implies a downside potential of more than 11 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. The firm said that Hindustan Zinc’s Q3 EBITDA rose 35 percent YoY driven by better silver prices, lower costs & higher volumes. The company is targeting 2 percent refined volume growth in FY26 & CoP of $1,000. Nuvama on Hindustan Zinc: Nuvama kept a ‘Reduce’ call on Hindustan Zinc shares, with a target price of Rs 591 apiece. This implies a downside potential of more than 10.5 percent over the stock’s previous closing price. The international brokerage said that the firm’s Q3 EBITDA was in-line with its estimates. Silver EBIT surged 56 percent QoQ, and accounted for 44 percent of EBIT. Nuvama lifted its EBITDA estimates by 28 percent for FY27 and 21 percent for FY28, assuming that the average zinc and silver prices of $3,000 and $60 for FY27, and $2,900 and $55 for FY28, respectively. The firm however said that Hindustan Zinc’s valuation is expensive at 11.1x FY28 EV/EBITDA. Follow all LIVE updates from the stock markets here."
LTIMindtree Q3 FY26 – Is the price already discounting the strong quarter?,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/moneycontrol-research/ltimindtree-q3-fy26-is-the-price-already-discounting-the-strong-quarter-13780264.html,"Highlights LTIMindtree (LTIM, CMP: Rs 6407, Market Cap: Rs 189,960 crore, Rating: Overweight) reported a good Q3 FY26 with a strong sequential surge in revenue despite the seasonality, uptick in margin, and steady deal flow. The management remains optimistic about clocking close to double-digit YoY growth in revenue in Q4 and maintaining the momentum in FY27. The stock has been an out-performer in the IT pack and has performed in line with the Nifty in the past year. While the headline valuation isn’t cheap, the growth journey makes us constructive. Strong surge in revenue Revenue for the last reported quarter Q3 FY26 at $1208 million represented a sequential growth of 2.4 percent in reported currency and in Constant Currency (CC). The reporting quarter (Q3FY26) saw strong performance from Healthcare, Life Sciences & Public Services, followed by Manufacturing & Resources. The Consumer business had a positive sequential growth. Weakness was seen in BFSI (banking financial service and insurance) and Technology, Media & Communication because of a combination of furloughs and productivity passthrough in some top accounts. All the three key markets of North America, Europe, and the Rest of the World (RoW) had a positive sequential growth. The PAN deal from India had a positive rub-off on RoW. Weakness in top accounts transitory Unlike the strength in the overall business, the top 5 accounts (which include the top hitech and BFSI account) de-grew YoY 8.7 percent and a sequential 2.9 percent in Q3 FY26. The temporary impact has been on account of recalibration as LTIM has passed on AI-driven productivity gains to customers. The top hi-tech account has started growing sequentially and the BFSI segment and the top account is likely to bottom out in Q4. The impact of the AI-led productivity gains is more meaningful in large engagements and the management expects growth momentum from these large accounts to resume from FY27. Guiding to margin stability LTIM’s EBIT margin expanded 20 basis points QoQ in Q3 FY26 to 16.1 percent. Tailwinds from the Fit-for-Future efficiency gains programme and forex were partially offset by furloughs and lower working days. The management remains confident of sustaining margin improvement supported by levers, including AI-driven productivity gains, pyramid optimisation through fresher hiring, and continued cost discipline. It has started a new programme called New Horizon for steady focus on cost and margin. The likely wage hike in Q4 to be spread over two quarters is likely to cause 1 percent margin headwind each quarter. LTIM reported a net headcount addition of 1,511 employees in Q3FY26, including 1736 freshers, taking the total workforce to 87,958. This further bolsters confidence on future execution. Gaining the AI edge The key initiatives from LTIM are launching ""Blueverse Studios"" in Mumbai and London as AI collaboration hubs for clients. The company has completed the GenAI Foundation training programme for 80,000 employees and has won multiple AI-specific deals, including developing agentic solutions and GenAI-based platforms for global clients. Bookings steady The Q3FY26 order book TCV (total contract value) stood at $1.69 billion, flat YoY but up by over 6 percent sequentially. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter with TCV above $ 1.5 billion. The management remains optimistic about achieving close to double-digit USD revenue growth in Q4 and maintaining the momentum, supported by robust deal wins, strong execution, continued operational efficiencies and opportunities arising from AI. Thanks to the outperformance, the stock isn’t cheap, but the growth trajectory warrants attention of long-term investors.

The yield curve bear steepened as cash trading resumed following a US holiday, with 10- and 30-year yields both climbing three basis points in early Asia trading. Dollar Index (Slips) The dollar retreated to its lowest level in a week in early trading on Monday after threats from the White House towards the European Union over the future of Greenland triggered a broad selloff across U.S. stocks and government bonds. Asian Currencies (Mixed) The won slips as South Korea’s stock benchmark looks set to end a 12 day rally, with fading risk appetite from US Europe tensions and firm dollar demand underpinning the exchange rate.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Tata Elxsi, Colgate Palmolive, Shriram Finance, Canara Bank, CCL Products, and others on January 20?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-tata-elxsi-colgate-palmolive-shriram-finance-canara-bank-ccl-products-and-others-on-january-20-13779904.html,"Equity benchmarks declined four-tenths of a percent on January 19, with market breadth consistently favouring bears. About 2,190 shares were under pressure against 728 shares that advanced on the NSE. The market is expected to consolidate and trade within the previous week’s range. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi Bajaj Auto | CMP: Rs 9,429.5 Bajaj Auto has entered a healthy pullback phase after breaking out above its long-term falling trendline, as visible on the chart. Such pullbacks are often considered constructive, as they allow prices to consolidate and attract fresh buying interest without damaging the overall trend structure. From an indicator perspective, the Directional Movement Index (DMI) shows the positive line clearly in control, suggesting that buying strength remains dominant. The Average Directional Index (ADX) is holding above the 20 level, indicating that the trend is gaining stability and strength rather than weakening. Meanwhile, the MACD remains above the zero line, reflecting positive momentum and supporting the continuation of the bullish trend. Based on this technical combination, the pullback is viewed as an opportunity rather than a sign of weakness. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 9,450–9,400 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 10,200 Stop-Loss: Rs 9,000 Balkrishna Industries | CMP: Rs 2,431.6 Balkrishna Industries has shown a strong improvement in its technical structure, supported by multiple bullish signals. The 9- and 26-DEMA have delivered a bullish crossover, indicating a shift in short-term momentum in favour of the bulls. In addition, the stock has confirmed a breakout above its falling trendline, suggesting a change in the medium-term trend. Momentum indicators further strengthen the positive outlook. The DMI has recorded a bullish crossover, reflecting increasing buying pressure, while the MACD has moved above the zero line, highlighting a transition into positive momentum territory. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 2,410–2,400 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,600 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,300 Tata Elxsi | CMP: Rs 5,563 Tata Elxsi has successfully retested its breakout zone, as highlighted on the chart, confirming the strength and sustainability of the recent breakout. Notably, volumes are picking up near lower levels, indicating strong accumulation interest and reinforcing the positive price structure. The breakout above the falling trendline further supports a shift in the medium-term trend from bearish to bullish. On the momentum front, the MACD is positioned above the zero line, signalling positive momentum, while the DMI continues to reflect bullish dominance. Additionally, the ADX is holding above the 25 level, suggesting that the emerging trend is gaining strength and reliability. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 5,600–5,500 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 6,250 Stop-Loss: Rs 5,200 Jay Thakkar, Vice President & Head of Derivatives and Quant Research at ICICI Securities Colgate Palmolive India | CMP: Rs 2,178 Colgate Palmolive has provided a breakout from the falling trendline, accompanied by a decrease in open interest, indicating short covering. There had been heavy short positions in the stock, and it had declined nearly 50 percent from its all-time high. Significant positive divergence is visible on both daily and weekly charts, indicating a higher probability of continued short covering. The risk-to-reward ratio is clearly in favour of the bulls; hence, one may initiate long positions in this series. Options data indicates that the Rs 2,200 strike has the highest Call base, and a close above this level could lead to further upward momentum. Buy Colgate Palmolive futures in the range of Rs 2,170–2,190. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,250, Rs 2,300 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,120 Mankind Pharma | CMP: Rs 2,117.2 Mankind Pharma has been forming lower tops and lower bottoms, with an increase in open interest clearly indicating short build-up in the near term. Hence, the short-term trend remains negative. A bounce witnessed a few weeks ago was largely due to short covering, and once that move ended, the stock resumed its primary downtrend, with fresh additions on the short side. There is a huge Call base at the Rs 2,200 strike, and the stock has closed significantly below this level. The maximum pain is also at the Rs 2,200 level. Until this level is decisively crossed, the short-term trend is likely to remain weak. Any bounce should be utilised as a selling opportunity. Sell Mankind Pharma futures in the range of Rs 2,120–2,140. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 2,060, Rs 2,020 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,180 HCL Technologies | CMP: Rs 1,716.8 HCL Tech has been moving higher following its Q3 results, indicating a bullish short-term trend. There has been a decrease in open interest along with a rise in price, suggesting short covering. Large-cap IT stocks have largely witnessed short build-up, with heavyweights such as Wipro, TCS, and Infosys still carrying substantial short positions. Meanwhile, midcap IT stocks have been outperforming large caps. Despite this, HCL Tech has emerged as an outperformer within the large-cap IT space and has been gradually forming higher tops and higher bottoms. As per options data, once the stock closes above the Rs 1,720 level, which has the highest Call base, it is likely to move towards the Rs 1,800 level. Buy HCL Tech futures in the range of Rs 1,700–1,720. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,760, Rs 1,800 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,645 Vidnyan S Sawant, Head of Research at GEPL Capital Shriram Finance | CMP: Rs 1,010.35 Shriram Finance continues to exhibit a robust structural uptrend across timeframes, characterised by a classical higher-top and higher-bottom price formation. On the weekly timeframe, the stock is firmly placed above its key 12- and 26-week EMAs, underscoring strong trend strength. The MACD momentum indicator is trending higher, reflecting acceleration in upside momentum and reinforcing the bullish bias. On the daily chart, the stock has displayed a bullish mean reversion from the 12-day DEMA, further validating the positive outlook and suggesting continuation of the prevailing uptrend. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,081 Stop-Loss: Rs 970 Canara Bank | CMP: Rs 156.86 Canara Bank has recently displayed strong positive structural developments on the higher timeframe. During the October series, the stock witnessed a decisive breakout above its multi-year swing highs of 2010 and 2024, marking a transition into uncharted territory. The stock is firmly sustaining above its 12-, 26-, and 50-period DEMA, while continuing to form higher tops and higher bottoms, highlighting strong relative strength amid prevailing market volatility. Momentum indicators further validate this strength, with the MACD remaining in buy mode, reinforcing that the ongoing uptrend is well supported by positive momentum. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 172 Stop-Loss: Rs 150 Bharat Electronics | CMP: Rs 412.8 BEL has been in a robust long-term uptrend since 2020, consistently demonstrating resilience on the monthly timeframe. On the weekly chart, the stock continues to form higher bottoms and is currently consolidating around its 26-week EMA, indicating healthy price digestion within an ongoing uptrend. On the daily timeframe, BEL maintains a higher-top and higher-bottom structure. Notably, during recent pullbacks, the stock has displayed a repetitive price behaviour wherein corrections tend to remain contained at around 4 percent, after which the stock resumes its upward trajectory. This recurring pattern reinforces the strength of the prevailing trend. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 447 Stop-Loss: Rs 400 CCL Products India | CMP: Rs 983.75 CCL Products has been on a sustained upward trajectory since 2020, forming a sequence of higher tops and higher bottoms on the monthly timeframe, a classic indication of a long-term bullish trend. On the weekly chart, the stock has exhibited a bullish mean reversion from the 26-week EMA, while the Stochastic oscillator remains in buy mode, reinforcing the positive outlook.

"India’s healthcare deals top Rs 10,000 crore in Q2FY26 as hospitals, diagnostics lead expansion: EY",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/india-s-healthcare-deals-top-rs-10-000-crore-in-q2fy26-as-hospitals-diagnostics-lead-expansion-ey-13779668.html,"Indian healthcare sector delivered one of its strongest quarters in recent years, clocking over Rs 10,000 crore in M&A transactions in Q2 FY26, underpinned by rising demand for high‑acuity care, rapid diagnostics expansion and aggressive capacity additions by leading hospital chains, EY‑Parthenon said in its quarterly sector update. Deal activity remained broad‑based across hospitals, diagnostics and specialty care, comprising buyouts, minority investments and cross‑border acquisitions. Private equity and strategic investors continued to chase scalable regional platforms with strong clinical depth and technology‑enabled models, EY said. Hospitals to add 18,000 Beds High‑end clinical specialties—oncology, cardiology, neurology and gastroenterology—drove a sharp pickup in patient volumes and pricing power across the sector. Average revenue per occupied bed rose 10–16% year‑on‑year among large chains, aided by higher case complexity and tighter pricing discipline. India’s biggest networks are in the middle of their most ambitious expansion cycle yet, with plans to add over 18,000 beds in the next three to five years. Apollo Hospitals, Max, Aster, NH, KIMS and several mid‑market chains reported double‑digit revenue growth, stable to rising occupancy and stronger international patient flows. Digital and home‑care‑led revenues contributed as much as 25–30 percent for some operators. Diagnostics leads growth Diagnostics chains again outperformed, recording 10–22 percent revenue growth. Several players posted EBITDA margins in the 25–35 percent range, benefiting from scale efficiencies and an accelerated shift toward genomics, molecular testing and oncology diagnostics. Preventive and wellness packages contributed up to 26% of quarterly revenue for select chains, reflecting rising out‑of‑pocket spending and deeper penetration into Tier‑3 and Tier‑4 cities. Industry consolidation continued, with integration of recent acquisitions—Core Diagnostics, DAPIC, Scientific Pathology—progressing across networks. Franchise‑led expansion in smaller towns remained a significant growth lever. Specialty hospitals, med‑tech see sustained momentum Single‑specialty chains, including oncology and mother‑and‑child operators, reported steady improvement in occupancy, driven by clinician additions and capacity expansion in fast‑growing clusters. Medical device companies delivered healthy revenue growth backed by capacity commissioning and global acquisitions in cardiology and orthopedics. Investor appetite strong despite valuation premiums Healthcare assets continued to command premium valuations, with listed-company EV/EBITDA multiples ranging from the mid‑teens to above 30x, EY said. Investors increasingly favored integrated platforms and tech‑enabled offerings, while also pushing portfolio companies to expand into Tier‑2 and Tier‑3 markets. “Q2 FY26 reinforces the structural strength of India’s healthcare sector,” said Kaivaan Movdawalla, National Healthcare Leader at EY‑Parthenon. “The clear shift toward high‑acuity care and the rapid rise of advanced diagnostics reflect a sector poised for long‑term, durable growth.” Outlook EY expects momentum to remain firm through FY26, supported by rising consumption, expanding insurance penetration and newly commissioned hospital capacity coming on stream. While margin pressure may persist for new assets, medium‑term fundamentals remain robust, the firm said. “Investor interest is set to remain strong as strategic and financial buyers build long‑term exposure to the sector,” said Amit Gupta, Partner – Healthcare & Life Sciences Investment Banking at EY. “Scalable platforms with strong unit economics and clear expansion pathways will command sustained premiums.” Some important deals in recent times Manipal Hospitals completed a full buyout of Sahyadri Hospitals from OTPP for Rs 5300 crore as part of its ongoing multi‑specialty expansion strategy, while Baby Memorial Hospital acquired a majority stake in Meitra Hospital for Rs 1000-Rs 1200 crore, adding a premium tertiary‑care platform to its portfolio. Fortis Healthcare strengthened its North India cluster with the Rs 470‑crore acquisition of Shrimann Hospitals in Punjab, even as Narayana Hrudayalaya made its first major overseas move with a £183‑million acquisition of Practice Plus Group Hospitals in the UK, marking its entry into that market. Yatharth Hospital also expanded its regional presence through a Rs 260‑crore purchase of a 150‑bed hospital in Agra from the local promoter group, further consolidating its footprint in North India."

Greenleaf Envirotech was also in focus, falling 3.64 percent to Rs 147, which was near the lower Bollinger bands, and extending downtrend for third consecutive session.

The report said the deal would give India’s largest pharmaceutical company by market value a stronger commercial base in the US—its largest market—and expand its presence in women’s health and the fast‑growing biosimilars segment. Organon, spun off from Merck in 2021 with a sizeable debt load, has been divesting assets to streamline its balance sheet and refocus on core biopharma operations. Its market value has more than halved over the past year, prompting renewed buyer interest, the newspaper reported. Sun Pharma has hired a European bank to help structure financing for the potential acquisition, ET said. While discussions have picked up as Organon’s share price weakened, there is no certainty the talks will result in a transaction. The buyer may consider an all‑cash bid or a combination of stock and cash, ET reported, adding that rival interest could still emerge. For Sun, the deal would represent its boldest global move since its purchase of Ranbaxy Laboratories in 2014. The potential acquisition of Organon would allow the drugmaker to significantly expand its US scale in specialty and branded medicines, while also broadening its women’s health footprint—a category where Organon has long‑established leadership. The deal would further strengthen Sun’s position in the consolidated global biosimilars market, giving it access to Organon’s portfolio developed with Samsung Bioepis, and diversify its US operations beyond dermatology and ophthalmology into higher‑margin therapeutic areas. Absorbing Organon could also help Sun accelerate its shift toward higher‑margin branded and specialty products in the US market, where it has launched several innovative therapies over the past few years. Investor anticipation around a potential sale has already driven Organon’s shares up 28% over the past month, reversing part of the steep losses the stock suffered earlier. Organon generated $6.4 billion in revenue in FY24, while its biosimilar portfolio, developed with Samsung Bioepis, contributed around $660 million last year. The US drugmaker inherited $9.5 billion in debt at its 2021 spin‑off and still carried $8.9 billion in borrowings by Q2 2025. It has been actively selling assets to cut leverage. It recently sold its postpartum hemorrhage device to Laborie Medical—to pivot more aggressively toward women’s health biopharma and biosimilars."

The Nifty ends 109 points lower, while the Sensex was down by 324 points. Among sectors, the Reality Index lost the most, shed over 2 percent, whereas despite weak market sentiment, some buying interest was seen in selective FMCG stocks. Technically, after an early morning intraday selloff, the market took support near 25,500/82900 and trimmed some losses. However, the short-term market texture remains weak. On daily charts, it has formed a bearish candle, and on intraday charts, it is holding a weak formation, which is largely negative. We are of the view that the current market texture is weak, but a fresh selloff is possible only if 25,500/82900 is dismissed. Below this level, the market could slip to 25,400-25,350/82600-82500. On the flip side, above 25,650/83500, a pullback move could extend till 25,750-25,800/83800-84000. The intraday market texture is volatile and non-directional; hence, level-based trading would be the ideal strategy for day traders. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The Nifty remained under bearish control, with the index sustaining below the 20 EMA throughout the session. Intraday volatility persisted, and every rise was sold into. The RSI continued in a bearish crossover and trended lower as the index closed at a multi-day low. Market fear remained elevated, as reflected by a spike in India VIX. In the near term, the index may continue to drift lower, with a potential downside target around 25,200, while resistance is placed near 25,700.

Antique Stockbroking, in its note, said Lenskart is scaling up at a fast pace with improving profitability in a favourable industry environment. It pointed out that only about 24 percent of India’s eyewear market is organised, while other markets also offer significant growth opportunities. The brokerage highlighted the company’s technology-led approach and centralised supply chain, which it said enable higher operational efficiency and more consistent product quality. It added that there is sufficient headroom for around 25 percent compound annual revenue growth in the medium term, but noted that current valuations largely factor in the growth outlook. Lenskart had made a weak stock market debut in November 2025, listing at a discount of around 3 percent to its issue price.

The stock climbed 4.15 percent to an intraday high of Rs 7,417 on the NSE, marking one of its strongest single-day gains in the past month. Shares of the company had ended nearly 3 percent lower on Friday. The wires and cables maker reported a 36 percent year-on-year rise in consolidated profit for the third quarter, while revenue jumped 46 percent. According to brokerage firm Jefferies, the company posted strong December-quarter volume growth of around 40 percent year-on-year in the cables and wires segment, driven by market share gains, private capital expenditure, housing demand and restocking. The brokerage, however, noted that margins were impacted during the quarter as the company did not fully pass on the rise in commodity prices in order to protect demand. Jefferies estimates a compound annual growth rate of 25 percent in profit after tax over FY25–FY28, led by volume growth and improvement in margins in the fast-moving electrical goods segment.

"Yes Bank shares fall 3% today after Q3 results; brokerages bearish on growth, returns",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/yes-bank-ltd-shares-fall-3-today-after-q3-results-brokerages-bearish-on-growth-returns-13778914.html,"Shares of Yes Bank fell nearly 3 percent in early trade on Monday despite the lender reporting a sharp jump in fiscal third quarter net profit, as brokerages flagged concerns over weak credit growth, sub-par returns and valuation comfort, and largely maintained their bearish stance on the stock. Yes Bank stock was trading at Rs 22.78 in the afternoon session, down 2.9 percent, even as the private sector lender posted a 55 percent year-on-year rise in standalone net profit for Q3 FY26, aided by a sharp reduction in provisions. Over the past one year, Yes Bank shares are still up over 20 percent, outperforming the benchmark Nifty 50’s roughly 10 percent gain. Profit jump fails to reassure Street Yes Bank’s Q3 profit growth was driven largely by a steep 91 percent year-on-year fall in provisions, helping lift return on assets to around 0.9 percent. However, several brokerages said that the improvement was not backed by a meaningful acceleration in core growth or sustainable returns. Anand Rathi said retail stress remains visible and return on equity continues to be sub-par, adding that the profit uptick was largely a function of lower provisioning rather than a structural improvement in earnings quality. Emkay Global maintained its ‘Sell’ rating with a target price of Rs 20, citing anemic credit growth of around 5 percent year-on-year, dragged by the retail segment. The brokerage said the bank remains dependent on recoveries from non-performing assets to drive profitability, while growth and return metrics continue to lag peers. Emkay also flagged elevated valuations, noting that the stock trades at about 1.4 times FY27 estimated adjusted book value, which it considers demanding given the weak growth profile and modest return outlook. While management commentary suggests that corporate portfolio consolidation may be largely behind and growth could improve, Emkay said it remains cautious, pointing to the possibility of another round of portfolio clean-up following potential top management changes. Citi adds to caution; analyst ratings show bearishness Citi, which also has a ‘Sell’ stance on the stock, acknowledged the bank’s efforts to reconstruct stressed assets and improve net interest margins. However, the brokerage said it is closely monitoring the Supreme Court hearing related to the AT-1 bonds case, which remains an overhang. According to LSEG data cited by Reuters, the stock is currently rated ‘Sell’ on average by 11 analysts, with a median target price of Rs 18, implying downside from current levels. While brokerages broadly agree that Yes Bank has made progress on asset quality and balance-sheet clean-up since its reconstruction, they remain unconvinced about the sustainability of earnings improvement without a sharper pickup in loan growth and a clearer path to higher returns.

NIM was weaker due to utilization of investments over cash towards lending, following CRR cut and incremental credit growth being led by corporate and mortgages. Fees were lesser due to weak unsecured growth and competitive pressure on loan related fees. Provisions were a drag due to one-time Rs12.8bn impact related to PSL non-compliance of Rs200- 250bn loans following RBI annual review. Two key concerns were dragging stock performance (1) lower loan growth and (2) extension of MD&CEO, Mr. Bakshi’s term. Loan growth has picked-up; bank expects this momentum to continue.

Chairman Dr Habil Khorakiwala has told Moneycontrol that Wockhardt has five to six new drugs slated for launch over the next four to five years and has more in early stages of development. ""So, we will have every two years, three years, a new drug coming out for the next 10 to 15 years. I have another two or three drugs which we have not even announced, which are in early stages,"" he said on the sidelines of an industry event in Mumbai recently. The portfolio, internally referred to as the “next wave of pipeline assets”, stays firmly anchored in antibiotics, an area big pharma has abandoned due to low commercial returns. Wockhardt chose a “white‑space strategy” in anti‑infectives, where global players have pulled back and resistance levels are rising sharply, creating both medical need and market opportunity, Khorakiwala said. “Why would we give up a lead we already have?” he said, adding Wockhardt plans to remain exclusively focused on antibiotics for the next 10–20 years. Wockhardt's antibiotic pipeline is focused heavily on multi-drug resistant (MDR) infections, with novel agents such as Zaynich (Zidebactam/Cefepime) currently seeking USFDA approval. WCK 6777 (Odrate), a once-daily outpatient treatment for complex infections such as those of the urinary tract and intra-abdominal, has received USFDA Fast Track designation. The company also has early-stage candidates such as WCK 771 and WCK 2349, and the recently launched Indian respiratory antibiotic Miqnaf (Nafithromycin), all targeting critical unmet needs for severe bacterial infections. The company also has WCK 4282, branded as Foviscu, undergoing clinical trials. Zaynich’s review status Khorakiwala said Zaynich’s new drug application (NDA) is under a six–to eight–month Fast Track USFDA review, with expected approval by mid‑2026, and he is “very confident of a positive outcome” for the drug aimed at life-threatening multi-drug resistant “superbugs”. Khorakiwala said the company is evaluating various strategies to take its pipeline global: building its own commercial footprint in markets such as the US for injectable hospital antibiotics, and selectively pursuing partnerships or licensing deals if the economics justify it. Wockhardt has appointed a merchant banker and is holding discussions with potential partners, though Khorakiwala insists the company will commercialise products independently if valuations do not reflect the scientific value created. Developing a commercial organisation is “far easier” than building a research engine, particularly since the company’s new drugs are aimed at tertiary-care, high-end hospitals that require focused sales teams of “50–100 people” in the US market, Khorakiwala said. He also positioned Wockhardt’s antibiotic research as a strategic national asset, saying India could become a global leader if the government directs funding and regulatory reforms toward organisations with demonstrated innovation capability. The company has called for streamlining Phase 3 approvals, which take nearly two years in India compared to five to six months in the US and Europe."

Wipro shares crash 7% as weak Q3 guidance outweighs steady operations; brokerages split on stock outlook,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/wipro-shares-crash-7-as-weak-q3-guidance-outweighs-steady-operations-brokerages-split-on-stock-outlook-13778256.html,"Wipro Ltd shares tumbled nearly 7 percent in Monday’s morning trade to around Rs 249, extending their recent underperformance, as investors reacted to weaker-than-expected near-term guidance issued alongside the company’s Q3 results late Friday. The selloff reflects investor concerns despite relatively steady operational performance in the fiscal third quarter. Today's fall adds to Wipro’s weak longer-term showing. The stock is down about 17.3 percent over the past year, sharply lagging the Nifty 50’s roughly 10 percent gain over the same period. For the quarter ended December 31, 2025, Wipro reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 3,119 crore, down 4 percent quarter-on-quarter and 7 percent year-on-year. IT services revenue stood at Rs 23,378 crore, missing Street estimates but rising 3.3 percent sequentially. Operating performance was mixed, with the company highlighting margin discipline and strong cash generation. However, at the heart of investor concern seems to be Wipro’s guidance for the March quarter, which came in below Street expectations, even as the company reported sequential revenue growth and maintained margins. Wipro guided for IT services revenue of $2.635 billion to $2.688 billion for the March quarter. This implies sequential growth of 0 percent to 2 percent in constant currency terms. Post-results brokerage commentary points to a clear divide. While some analysts see value support and operational discipline, others argue that weak deal momentum and execution risks justify caution -- views that appear to be driving Monday’s sell-off. Nomura: Buy, but flags guidance disappointment Nomura reiterated a Buy rating on Wipro with a target price of Rs 290 per share, arguing that Q3 operational performance was ahead of expectations. The brokerage acknowledged that Q4 guidance was weaker than anticipated, but noted that deal wins remained steady and margin discipline was intact. While Nomura cut its EPS estimates for FY27–FY28, it believes valuation comfort and dividend yield provide downside support to the stock. Jefferies: Underperform on growth and margin risks Jefferies struck a more cautious tone, maintaining an Underperform rating with a target price of Rs 220 per share. The brokerage said Q3 adjusted results were largely in line with expectations, but flagged weak deal bookings and delays in ramping new contracts as key risks to growth guidance. Jefferies also warned that margins could come under pressure from deal ramp-ups and acquisitions, and said low EPS CAGR and limited dividend appeal make the stock’s risk-reward unattractive.

HDFC Bank shares slip today post Q3 results despite bullish brokerage calls,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/hdfc-bank-shares-slip-today-post-q3-results-despite-bullish-brokerage-calls-13778129.html,"HDFC Bank shares slipped in early trade on Monday as investors reacted to the lender’s Q3 FY26 results, even as brokerage commentary on the quarter remained largely constructive over the bank's medium-term outlook. The stock was trading at Rs 926.65 in the opening minutes, down 0.48 percent. Ahead of the quarterly results, HDFC Bank shares had risen 0.55 percent on Friday to close at Rs 930.55 on the NSE. The stock has gained 13.7 percent over the past one year, outperforming the benchmark Nifty 50, which has returned less than 11 percent over the same period. Over the weekend, HDFC Bank reported an 11.5 percent year-on-year rise in standalone net profit to Rs 18,650 crore for the December quarter, supported by steady core earnings, margin expansion and lower credit costs. Net interest income grew 6.4 percent, while asset quality remained stable, with gross NPAs unchanged sequentially at 1.24 percent. Brokerage reactions to the results were largely constructive. CLSA and Bernstein reiterated Outperform ratings with target prices of Rs 1,200 per share, citing a modest earnings beat, improving margins and disciplined cost control. Jefferies maintained a Buy call with a higher target price of Rs 1,240, while Kotak Institutional Equities retained an Add rating with a target of Rs 1,050. While analysts broadly praised the bank’s margin improvement and consistent earnings delivery, several brokerages flagged moderating deposit growth as the key near-term monitor, noting that a pickup in deposits would be important for reducing the loan-to-deposit ratio and supporting further upside in the stock.

"ICICI Bank shares crash 3% today even as brokerages bullish on Q3 results, view CEO extension a key relief",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/icici-bank-stock-outlook-brokerages-largely-positive-even-after-q3-profit-miss-ceo-extension-a-key-relief-13778084.html,"ICICI Bank share price fell as much as 3 percent in the opening trade on Monday after its Q3 FY26 results, even as the brokerages gave bullish calls on the stock. The stock fell to Rs 1,367 on NSE, down 3.1 percent from the previous close. Brokerages largely retained their positive stance on ICICI Bank stock after the lender’s fiscal third quarter results, looking past a profit miss driven by one-off provisions, while pointing to steady operating trends, stable margins and an improving deposit trajectory. The extension of CEO Sandeep Bakhshi’s tenure also emerged as a key positive, removing a lingering overhang on the stock. ICICI Bank reported a 4 percent year-on-year decline in standalone net profit to Rs 11,318 crore in Q3 FY26, as higher one-off provisions weighed on earnings. Net interest income rose 7.7 percent year-on-year, supported by stable margins of 4.3 percent, while loan growth remained healthy, led by the corporate segment. Asset quality improved during the quarter, with the gross NPA ratio easing to 1.53 percent, though elevated provisions tempered overall profitability. Ahead of the quarterly results, ICICI Bank share price fell 0.4 percent on Friday to end at Rs 1,413 on NSE. The stock has gained over 15 percent in the last one year, outperforming benchmark Nifty 50, which has returned less than 11 percent during the same period. ICICI Bank stock call: Brokerages bullish on growth Brokerages also pointed to loan growth led by the corporate and mortgage segments, improving deposit traction with a stable CASA ratio. CLSA reiterated its Outperform rating on ICICI Bank with a target price of Rs 1,700 per share, implying an upside of over 20 percent. CLSA said the Q3 profit before tax missed estimates by about 7 percent due to a one-time provision. Excluding this impact, the brokerage said the bank’s adjusted performance was largely in line with expectations. CLSA highlighted 4 percent quarter-on-quarter and 12 percent year-on-year loan growth, led by the corporate segment, while noting that margins remained stable at 4.3 percent. Deposit growth improved to 9 percent year-on-year, with the CASA ratio holding steady, and asset quality trends remained strong with improved slippage ratios. Also read | HDFC Bank stock outlook: Brokerages bullish after Q3 profit beat Jefferies maintained its Buy rating and raised its target price to Rs 1,730 per share, attributing the Q3 earnings miss to higher agricultural provisions and the impact of labour law-related costs. The brokerage said loan growth improved to 12 percent, driven by corporate and mortgage loans, while unsecured retail lending remained soft. Asset quality stayed stable, Jefferies said, adding that the two-year extension granted to CEO Sandeep Bakhshi until October 2028 provides continuity and clarity at the top. Bernstein, which has a more cautious stance, retained its Market Perform rating with a target price of Rs 1,550 per share. The brokerage acknowledged that the CEO’s re-appointment meaningfully reduces an overhang on the stock; but it flagged a weaker quarterly performance. Bernstein said loan and deposit growth trailed broader system trends, margins were flat quarter-on-quarter compared with improvements seen at peers, and a one-time spike in credit costs hurt profitability. It also noted that earnings per share declined on a year-on-year basis. Kotak Institutional Equities reiterated its Add rating and raised its target price to Rs 1,800 per share, noting that Q3 FY26 earnings declined around 4 percent year-on-year due to higher one-off provisions. Kotak said the extension of the CEO’s tenure until October 2028 removes uncertainty, while loan growth of about 10 percent year-on-year and deposit growth of around 8 percent year-on-year point to steady underlying momentum. The brokerage described operating profit growth as muted at about 3 percent year-on-year but said asset quality remained stable and the bank’s strong liability franchise continues to support its long-term outlook.

"HDFC Bank stock outlook: Brokerages bullish after Q3 profit beat, flag deposit growth as key monitor",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/hdfc-bank-stock-outlook-brokerages-bullish-after-q3-profit-beat-flag-deposit-growth-as-key-monitor-13778041.html,"Brokerages largely retained their bullish stance on HDFC Bank stock after its Q3 FY26 results, citing a modest earnings beat, improving margins and controlled costs, while continuing to flag deposit growth as the key near-term concern for the lender. Over the weekend, HDFC Bank reported an 11.5 percent year-on-year rise in standalone net profit to Rs 18,650 crore in Q3 FY26, aided by steady core earnings, margin expansion and lower credit costs. Net interest income grew 6.4 percent, while asset quality remained stable, with gross NPAs unchanged sequentially at 1.24 percent. Ahead of the quarterly results, HDFC Bank shares had risen 0.55 percent on Friday to end at Rs 930.55 on the NSE. The stock has gained 13.7 percent in the last one year, outperforming benchmark Nifty 50, which has returned less than 11 percent during the same period. HDFC Bank stock call: Brokerages say 'buy' Brokerages stayed constructive on the stock even as they flagged moderating deposit growth and the need for stronger mobilisation to support a re-rating. CLSA reiterated its Outperform rating on HDFC Bank stock with a target price of Rs 1,200 per share, implying an upside of about 29 percent. The brokerage noted that the bank’s Q3 FY26 profit before tax was 5 percent ahead of estimates, aided by in-line pre-provision operating profit and lower-than-expected credit costs. Core operating profit came in 2 percent above expectations, driven by better net interest margins and cost control. CLSA highlighted an 8 basis point sequential expansion in margins, supported by lower deposit costs and the benefit of the CRR cut, even as loan growth at 2.7 percent quarter-on-quarter lagged its estimate. Deposit growth moderated to 12 percent year-on-year due to curtailment of wholesale deposits, though average CASA growth improved during the quarter. Also read | ICICI Bank stock outlook: Brokerages largely positive even after Q3 profit miss; CEO extension a key relief Bernstein also maintained an Outperform rating with a Rs 1,200 target, pointing to consistent earnings delivery. The brokerage noted that Q3 earnings per share growth improved to 11 percent year-on-year from 10 percent in the previous quarter, supported by steady net interest income, marginal increase in the loan-to-deposit ratio, release of provision buffers, cost discipline and healthy fee income. Return on assets remained stable, it said. Jefferies reiterated its Buy call and raised a slightly higher target price of Rs 1,240 per share, after the bank reported profit ahead of estimates. While core profit was largely in line after adjusting for provision releases and one-offs, Jefferies said deposit growth of around 12 percent remains a concern. The brokerage noted management’s clarification that the bank exited costlier deposits to improve margins, adding that a pickup in deposit growth would be critical for reducing the loan-to-deposit ratio and supporting a re-rating of the stock. Asset quality remained stable, it added. Kotak Institutional Equities maintained an Add rating with a target price of Rs 1,050 per share, highlighting a 12 percent year-on-year growth in Q3 FY26 earnings. Operating profit rose 8 percent, while provisions declined 10 percent year-on-year. Loan growth stood at 12 percent, and net interest margins improved 10 basis points sequentially to 3.3 percent. Kotak said the bank’s guidance for above-industry growth in FY27 reflects the need for stronger deposit mobilisation going ahead.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade UPL, IDBI Bank, Mishra Dhatu Nigam, Tech Mahindra, HCL Technologies, and others on January 19?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-upl-idbi-bank-mishra-dhatu-nigam-tech-mahindra-hcl-technologies-and-others-on-january-19-13777775.html,"The benchmark indices saw pressure at higher levels in the later part of the session and closed flat with a positive bias on January 16, with weak market breadth. A total of 1,675 shares declined against 1,233 advancing shares on the NSE. Consolidation with rangebound trading may continue for a few more sessions. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Rajesh Palviya, Senior Vice President Research (Head Technical Derivatives) at Axis Securities Punjab National Bank | CMP: Rs 132.36 On the weekly chart, Punjab National Bank is trending higher, forming a series of higher tops and bottoms, indicating bullish sentiment. It has also surpassed the multiple resistance zone of Rs 126 levels on a closing basis, along with huge volumes, indicating increased participation. The stock is well placed above its 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-day SMA, which reconfirms the bullish trend. The daily, weekly, and monthly strength RSI is in positive territory, which signals rising strength. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 142, Rs 155 Stop-Loss: Rs 128 JK Cement | CMP: Rs 5,885 With a weekly closing, JK Cement has confirmed a past 6–7 weeks’ down-sloping trendline breakout at Rs 5,750 levels on a closing basis, indicating a short-term trend reversal. A bullish crossover of the 20- and 50-day SMAs reconfirms the short-term bullish trend. The daily and weekly strength RSI is in positive territory, which signals rising strength. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 6,200, Rs 6,450 Stop-Loss: Rs 5,650 UPL | CMP: Rs 790.15 For the past couple of years, UPL has been trending higher, forming a series of higher tops and bottoms, indicating a sustained uptrend. With the current close, the stock is approaching the “multiple resistance zone” breakout of Rs 820–830 levels. Any sustainable move above the same may trigger fresh upside momentum toward Rs 900–950 levels. The stock is well placed above its 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-day SMA, and these averages are also inching up along with rising prices, which reconfirms a bullish trend. The daily and monthly strength RSI is in positive territory, which signals rising strength. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 830, Rs 900 Stop-Loss: Rs 760 Osho Krishan, Chief Manager - Technical & Derivative Research at Angel One IDBI Bank | CMP: Rs 104.55 IDBI Bank has experienced profit booking post the breakout over a multi-week resistance and has retested the neckline in the previous week. The technical structure remains robust, with the cycle of higher highs intact in the counter and the stock comfortably placed near the 20 DEMA. Additionally, the SuperTrend parameter indicates a bullish outlook, and the recent correction provides an opportunity to reiterate bullish positions from a short- to medium-term perspective. Hence, we recommend buying the stock around Rs 102–100. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 118, Rs 122 Stop-Loss: Rs 92 Inox Green Energy Services | CMP: Rs 189.38 Inox Green Energy has undergone a corrective phase of nearly 30 percent from its lifetime high post the formation of an ‘Inverted H&S’ on daily charts, and with the recent plunge, the counter has retested the neckline. Simultaneously, there has been a ‘bullish divergence’ between the RSI and price action, that too at the neckline and the 200 DSMA, suggesting the initiation of a counter-trend in the stock price in the near period. Hence, we recommend buying the stock around Rs 185–180. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 220, Rs 240 Stop-Loss: Rs 160 Mishra Dhatu Nigam | CMP: Rs 357.85 Mishra Dhatu Nigam has demonstrated substantial consolidation near its significant EMAs in the last couple of weeks. Additionally, the counter is in a ‘symmetrical triangle’ formation on the broader timeframe and witnessed a volume spurt near the lower band, which has pushed the counter to a higher zone in the recent period. Also, the technical indicators are strongly aligned with the price momentum, indicating a bullish outlook for the near term. Hence, we recommend buying the stock around Rs 350. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 385, Rs 400 Stop-Loss: Rs 320 Anshul Jain, Head of Research at Lakshmishree Investments Tech Mahindra | CMP: Rs 1,670.5 Backed by strong earnings, Tech Mahindra has broken out of a 46-week bullish VCP (volatility contraction pattern) structure near Rs 1,633, signaling a clear shift in trend strength. The stock closed right at the key resistance of Rs 1,684, highlighting this level as the immediate trigger zone. Volume expansion through the base and breakout confirms institutional participation, while rising daily and weekly moving averages underline improving momentum alignment. A sustained move above Rs 1,684 would unlock a sharper upmove toward the prior all-time high of Rs 1,756.85, which now looks more like a minor pause than a ceiling. Beyond that, the broader VCP pattern projects an extended upside toward the Rs 1,900 zone. Risk–reward remains favourable as long as the price holds above the breakout base, with pullbacks likely to be shallow and absorbed. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,900 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,600 HCL Technologies | CMP: Rs 1,698 HCL Technologies has confirmed a decisive breakout from a 29-week bullish cup-and-handle pattern near Rs 1,695, marking a clear trend acceleration. The standout feature is the right side of the pattern forming a tight flag, adding momentum fuel for bulls. The handle also represented the first controlled pullback into rising 10-, 20-, and 50-week moving averages, which are now acting as a strong launchpad. Breakout volumes have expanded sharply, signaling institutional participation and conviction. The price structure across timeframes remains constructive, with risk–reward favourably skewed higher. As long as the stock holds above the breakout zone, follow-through momentum can drive an initial move toward the Rs 1,825–1,938 band. Failure to sustain above the moving average cluster would be the key invalidation. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,825, Rs 1,938 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,640 Force Motors | CMP: Rs 20,565 Force Motors has delivered a clean breakout from a 20-week rectangle formation near Rs 20,500, signaling a resumption of its primary uptrend. The consolidation was constructive, with the price resting firmly on rising 10-, 20-, and 50-week moving averages, which have now aligned to form a strong launchpad. The breakout structure reflects absorption rather than distribution, keeping trend strength intact across timeframes. Volume behaviour remains supportive, indicating steady participation rather than speculative excess. As long as the stock sustains above the breakout zone, momentum is likely to extend further. The immediate upside projection points toward the Rs 22,500 zone, where partial resistance may emerge. Risk–reward remains favourable while the price holds above the rectangle base, with any pullback toward rising averages expected to attract demand rather than trigger supply. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 22,500 Stop-Loss: Rs 19,500"
Broader indices underperform but these 27 small-cap stocks gain up to 62%,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/broader-indices-underperform-but-these-27-small-cap-stocks-gain-up-to-62-13776730.html,"Broader indices lagged the benchmarks during the week, with mid- and small-cap indices extending losses for a second straight week, declining up to 0.4 percent. For the week, BSE Sensex index fell 5.89 points at 83570.35, while Nifty50 index rose 11.05 points or 0.04 percent at 25694.35. Sectorally, Nifty Consumer Durables, Realty, Pharma, Healthcare shed 2 percent each, Nifty Auto index slipped 1.75 percent and Nifty Media index down 1 percent during the week. On the other hand, Nifty PSU Bank, Metal added 4.5% each and Nifty IT index rose 2.8%. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) extended their selling in this week also as they offloaded equities worth Rs 14,265.58 crore. In contrast, Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) provided support to the market, purchasing equities worth RS 16,173.69 crore. ""The Indian equity markets experienced a range-bound trading week, with the benchmark index oscillating within the confines of its 50 and 100-day EMAs. Despite heightened intraday volatility and sharp swings in both directions, the Nifty50 concluded the truncated week on a subdued note, settling a tad below the 25700 mark and registering a marginal weekly gain of 0.04%,"" said Osho Krishan, Chief Manager -Technical and Derivative research at Angel One. ""The shortened trading week was eventful, influenced by a mix of global and domestic developments. Persistent concerns around trade tariffs and escalating geopolitical tensions continued to weigh on investor sentiment, fostering a cautious market environment. At the same time, ongoing quarterly earnings announcements and key macroeconomic data provided selective opportunities across sectors. Despite these headwinds, the market exhibited notable resilience. The Nifty50 index managed to contain downside risks, holding near the key EMA on the daily charts, underscoring the underlying strength and consolidation phase in the broader market structure."" ""Going forward, it remains crucial to closely monitor global developments, particularly those related to trade tariffs and geopolitical tensions, as these factors are likely to act as significant catalysts in shaping near-term market trends. Additionally, several heavyweight constituents of the Nifty are scheduled to announce their earnings over the weekend, the impact of which is expected to be reflected in market action in the forthcoming sessions. In this backdrop, a prudent and disciplined approach is recommended, with market participants aligning their strategies around the aforementioned technical levels,"" he added. The BSE Small-cap index declined nearly 0.5 percent during the week. Stocks such as Genesys International Corporation, Nectar Lifesciences, GTPL Hathway, Universal Cables, Tejas Networks, InfoBeans Technologies, Lotus Chocolate Company, United Foodbrands, Amal, Igarashi Motors, Cohance Lifesciences, Globus Spirits and Jindal Poly Films fell between 10–18 percent. Meanwhile, Wardwizard Innovations and Mobility, JTL Industries, Antelopus Selan Energy, IFCI, Baazar Style Retail, Angel One, Dredging Corporation India, 3B BlackBio Dx, Neogen Chemicals and Antony Waste Handling Cell gained between 15–62 percent. Where is Nifty50 headed? Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities Nifty on the weekly chart formed a small bull candle with upper and lower shadow. Technically, this market action signal formation of high wave type candle pattern after a sharp weakness of previous week. This reflects ongoing volatility in the market. The underlying trend of Nifty remains choppy. A sustainable move above 25900 could open further upside for the next week. However, a slide below the support of 25500 could trigger more downside in the market ahead. Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking The ongoing tussle around the medium-term moving average, the 100 DEMA near the 25,600 zone, is keeping participants cautious. The market is likely to take cues from the earnings announcements of key heavyweights such as Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank in early trade on Monday, which could determine the next directional move. Until then, participants are advised to maintain a selective, stock-specific approach, focusing on sectors showing relative strength such as IT, financials and metals, while adhering to disciplined risk management in the prevailing volatile environment. Amol Athawale, VP Technical Research, Kotak Securities We are of the view that the current market formation is volatile and non-directional, and the short-term activity indicating a non-directional trend is likely to continue in the near future. On the downside, 25,500/83000 and 25,400/82700 would act as key support zones, while the daily SMA (Simple Moving Average) at 25,950/84600 and the 20-day SMA at 26,000/84800 would be crucial resistance levels for the bulls. For Bank Nifty, as long as it is trading above the 20-day SMA at 59,500, the uptrend is likely to continue. On the higher side, it could move up to 60,500. Further upside potential may lift the index up to 60,800. Conversely, if it falls below the 20-day SMA at 59,500, the uptrend would become vulnerable.

Wall Street ends little changed before long weekend,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/wall-street-ends-little-changed-before-long-weekend-13776717.html,"US stocks ended nearly flat on Friday in a choppy session ahead of the long weekend, and all three major indexes ​posted losses for the week as fourth-quarter earnings season kicked off. Healthcare fell 0.8% and led declines for the day among S&P ‌500 sectors. Shares of chipmakers rose, with an index of semiconductors gaining 1.2% and extending gains from Thursday. Big U.S. banks posted mostly solid results this week as the S&P 500 reporting period got under way. Still, shares of banks and other financial institutions have been pressured by worries over U.S. President Donald Trump's proposed one-year cap on credit card interest rates at 10%. The S&P 500 financial sector ended up 0.1% on Friday but posted its biggest weekly percentage decline since October. Investors also ‌digested news that Trump said he may want to keep economic adviser Kevin Hassett in his current role, lowering ​market bets that Hassett would succeed Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. ""To finish the week around flat with the S&P 500 still within spitting distance of 7,000 - most investors will take that as a win two weeks into the year,"" said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial. ""One of ‍the other reasons markets have been flat-lining is we're at the start of the earnings season,"" he said. ""Bank earnings are showing a generally favorable economic and business backdrop. Now we're going to start seeing other companies tied to other sectors, and that's going to give us a better take on fundamental conditions."" The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 83.11 points, ⁠or 0.17%, to 49,359.33, the S&P 500 lost 4.46 points, or 0.06%, to 6,940.01 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 14.63 points, or 0.06%, to ‍23,515.39. For the week, the S&P 500 was down 0.38%, the Nasdaq declined 0.66% and the Dow fell 0.29%. The earnings season ramps up next week with reports from heavyweights ‌including Netflix, ‌Johnson & Johnson and Intel. Investors were also cautious of making big bets ahead of the long weekend, with the stock market shut on Monday for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. While stocks have largely traded in a relatively tight range in recent sessions, some options market participants expect more choppy price action in coming days following Friday's monthly options expiration. ""Historically the middle part of January tends to be pretty choppy,"" said Bruce Zaro, managing director at Granite Wealth ⁠Management in Plymouth, Massachusetts. ""Once we work our ⁠way through that, then we ​are likely to see a little bit better performance out to the end of the month. Hopefully, we'll find the month positive,"" which could suggest positive performance for the year, Zaro said. The week also saw money shifting out of some heavyweight tech names into more undervalued areas, with mid- and small-cap stocks outperforming the benchmark S&P 500. The small-cap ‍Russell 2000 (.RUT), opens new tab reached another record closing high on Friday and gained 2.04% for the week. Most of the major S&P 500 sector also ended with gains for the week, with real estate, consumer staples and industrials leading in weekly increases. Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 1.19-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. There were 423 new highs and 64 new lows on ​the NYSE. On the Nasdaq, 2,034 stocks rose and 2,719 fell as declining issues outnumbered ‍advancers by a 1.34-to-1 ratio.

Can IT sector see market re-rating amid positive AI commentary by Infosys after TCS? Analysts say 'evidence of monetisation' needed,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/can-it-sector-see-market-re-rating-amid-positive-ai-commentary-by-infosys-after-tcs-analysts-say-evidence-of-monetisation-needed-13776099.html,"IT stocks saw significant surge on December 16, buoyed by the positive October-December quarter results and management commentary on artificial intelligence (AI) progress by heavyweight Infosys. Analysts have commented on whether the sharp rebound in IT stocks can lead to a market re-rating and take them to fresh highs. Infosys shares closed around 6 percent higher, leading gains on the Nifty IT index which rose more than 3 percent to a three-week high of 39,086.65. Notably, the IT index was the worst performing sector in 2025, falling around 15 percent during the year overall. Infosys Q3 Results: Infosys reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 6,654 crore for Q3 FY26, marking a 2.2 percent year-on-year (YoY) fall from the Rs 6,806 crore net profit reported in Q3 FY25. This however included Rs 1,289-crore one-time cost on account of new labour codes. The IT major’s revenue from operations meanwhile rose 9 percent YoY to Rs 45,479 crore. The company revised its fiscal ending 2026 revenue growth forecast upwards to 3-3.5 percent, from an earlier estimate of 2-3 percent. AI commentary: Infosys said it now has over 500 AI agents and is doing AI work with more than 90 percent of its top 200 clients, as it pitches itself as an ""AI partner of choice"" for large enterprises. ""They are using agents in several of our service lines to help enhance either growth or productivity,"" CEO and managing director Salil Parekh said during the company's post-earnings press conference on January 14. Infosys is well placed to benefit from enterprise-wide AI spending, given its discretionary heavy mix, said Motilal Oswal Financial Services, which retained its 'Buy' call on the stock. At the current valuations, upside risks meaningfully outweigh downside risks, it added, while keeping a target price of Rs 2,200 per share for the stock, which implies a 37 percent upside potential from the previous closing price. Infosys's push for vendor consolidation is boosting growth prospects, while its AI library is strengthening its position as clients expand account sizes during renewals, Morningstar said.""Infosys is in a better competitive position compared with other Indian IT consulting firms due to its comprehensive AI offerings,"" the brokerage added. Infosys, which won AI-led deals with Adobe and Siemens AG in 2025, did not disclose revenue from AI projects. Last month, Accenture beat first-quarter revenue estimates on strong demand for AI-driven IT services. Tata Consultancy Services' annualised AI revenue jumped 17.3 percent sequentially to $1.8 billion, outpacing its December quarter growth of 1.96 percent. ""The growth momentum we witnessed in Q2 FY26 continued in Q3 FY26. We remain steadfast in our ambition to become the world’s largest AI-led technology services company, guided by a comprehensive five-pillar strategy,"" CEO and managing director K Krithivasan said. HCLTech said its AI revenue came in at $146 million, up from $100 million in the previous quarter. Revenue from the company's banking and technology verticals rose by 8.1 percent and 14.4 percent respectively, while that from life sciences fell 2 percent during the quarter. Earlier this week, Motilal Oswal said it expects AI-related deal conversion to begin to show up in revenue in H2 FY27. This is also when AI-linked productivity deflation begins to be offset by new AI services work. The firm sees large-cap revenue growth rates starting to improve toward the 6-7 percent range, and AI services moving into the full deployment mode by FY28. Industry revenue growth rates materially will likely accelerate to 8-9 percent (as against today's 3–4 percent) as AI modernisation, data workloads, and enterprise integration scale up, the domestic brokerage said, adding that this supports a sector-wide rerating as growth visibility improves. HDFC Securities meanwhile said that AI will remain a dominant factor shaping economic and market conditions going forward, and AI-led recovery will likely accelerate in H2 2026 after a muted H1 for the Indian IT sector. According to a new research survey by Capgemini Research, after an era of 'AI hype', business leaders are now increasingly realistic and pragmatic about their AI strategies, and have started using it in their decision-making. Can IT rebound lead to markets re-rating? IT stocks carry a significant share in benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty, and are closely tracked by investors globally. Strong earnings from Infosys could act as a short-term sentiment booster for the broader market as a positive earnings outcome and a better outlook help signal that demand conditions in key overseas markets may be stabilising, which supports overall risk appetite, said Ravi Singh, Chief Research Officer at Master Capital Services. As confidence builds, this could lead to short-term momentum not only in IT but also in other industries, the analyst said. However, for this to result in long-term market strength, comparable earnings traction must also be seen in other heavyweight sectors, according to Singh. ""If not, the effects of optimism driven by IT are probably going to be more tactical than systemic,"" he added. ""Although the long-term growth is reinforced by companies like Infosys and TCS's increased focus on AI, it is unlikely to lead to a broad-based valuation re-rating in a short time. Before allocating higher multiples, markets typically wait for stronger evidence of profit, margin growth and steady earnings contribution from AI-led deals,"" Singh said. 'Markets need to see consistent performance in AI space': For a rerating, markets need to see consistent quarter performance in the AI space, including tangible deals and acquisitions, said Shravan Shetty, Managing Director at Primus Partners, who added that the earnings commentary and forward guidance would need to point towards this. Narendra Solanki, Head Fundamental Research - Investment Services at Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers, however noted that with Infosys results, there has been a visible shift in the sentiments in the IT space and markets are expecting similar momentum from other companies. ""IT sector has decent weights in frontline indices and definitely may lead the indices in near term. However, scaling towards fresh highs alone on back if IT sector is possible but difficult at this juncture and need participation from other heavy weights as well,"" he added. Will strong results trigger re-rating for IT stocks? Speaking on whether the strong results will drive a re-rating for IT stocks, Harshal Dasani, Business Head at INVasset PMS, said that AI commentary is directionally constructive, but a full rerating needs evidence of monetisation, not just intent. ""In the near term, AI is more likely to drive a ‘selective rerating’ within IT rather than a blanket multiple expansion. Companies with higher exposure to short-cycle, ROI-led AI work and strong platform partnerships may see faster earnings revisions, while others may remain range-bound. The rerating trigger for the sector will be consistent: rising AI contribution to deal wins, expanding wallet share in core verticals like BFSI, and confirmation that GenAI is incremental rather than cannibalising legacy work. So yes, AI can change the slope of the cycle—but it is still early, and the market will demand proof through numbers over the next 2–3 quarters,"" Dasani said. Axis Securities remained 'cautiously optimistic' for the Indian IT sector. It noted that Infosys’ sequential growth trajectory suggests a stable environment rather than an improving one."
"Realty stocks snap 7-day losing streak on Godrej Properties, Prestige's strong Q3 biz updates: What lies ahead?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/realty-stocks-snap-7-session-losing-streak-on-strong-q3-business-updates-what-lies-ahead-13775926.html,"The shares of real estate companies rose in trade on January 16, pushing the Nifty Realty index into the green after a seven-session losing streak. The Nifty Realty index gained more than 2 percent to hit intraday high of 867.65 on Friday, before paring some gains. The index closed 0.35 percent higher at 853. Top realty gainers: Prestige Estates were the top gainer on the index, rising nearly 2 percent to trade at Rs 1,524.10 apiece. This comes after the company announced that it has recorded pre-sales worth Rs 4,183.6 crore during the October-December quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026, marking a 30 percent YoY growth. For the April-December period, the company’s pre-sales surged 122 percent YoY to Rs 22,327.3 crore, marking the highest sales ever achieved by the company and surpassing its previous full-year peak sales. The firm also announced the launch of Evergreen at Prestige Raintree Park in Whitefield, Bengaluru. Macrotech Developers (Lodha), Oberoi Realty and Godrej Properties shares followed, rising around 1 percent each. Godrej Properties on January 15 announced that it has emerged as the largest listed residential real estate developer in India in 2025 for the second consecutive year, based on key operating metrics of booking value and cash collections. The firm sold 16,428 homes with a total saleable area of 27.26 million sq. ft. in 2025, supported by 41 successful project launches across India. Its booking value grew 19 percent YoY to Rs 34,171 crore with a CAGR of nearly 44 percent between 2022 and 2025. Bucking the trend, Anant Raj, DLF, Brigade Enterprises and Phoenix Mills shares were trading in the red with marginal losses. Sobha shares however fell more than 1 percent. Are IT layoffs behind the recent downturn? Indian IT sector has seen mass layoffs last year, which have now spilled over to this year. According to analysts, the IT layoffs have impacted housing demand in key areas, thereby impacting the stocks. IT layoffs are likely to be the major reason for the low demand in the luxury segment of urban centers like Bangalore and Hyderabad as they will be discouraging the high-income buyers, said Shashank Gupta, Director, RPS Group. He added that mid-to-premium housing sales, which have already dropped 15 percent year-on-year, will continue to be affected negatively as the professionals will not be willing to upgrade, opting instead to rent amid such job uncertainties. ""The market has whispered to the executives with Nifty Realty down by 20% from the peaks and talking about the disruption posed by the AI, which also indicates that 30% of the IT jobs that are luxury demand would get stifled due to the automation by 2027. The stock corrections that are expected to be around 5-7% are dependent on the RBI rate cuts and policy revamps that could fuel the market by the second quarter of 2026,"" the analyst said. Keshav Mangla, GM Business Development at Forteasia Realty, cited Anarock data to explain that financial tech layoffs of more than 1 lakh since 2024 have already resulted in a 12 percent drop in the demand for Tier-1 cities, thus resulting in developers' difficulties in managing cash flows and having to sell off their inventory.

"BEL, Mazagon Dock, other defence shares decline up to 2% on easing geopolitical concerns",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/bel-mazagon-dock-other-defence-shares-decline-up-to-2-on-easing-geopolitical-concerns-13775640.html,"Shares of defence firms such as Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL) and Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders fell up to 2 percent on Friday amid easing geopolitical concerns, triggering profit booking in the sector. The selling pressure pulled down the Nifty Defence index by up to 1 percent, snapping its previous session’s gains. Out of the 18 stocks in the index, only four were trading in the green. Market participants attributed the decline to profit taking after a short-term, news-driven reaction. Sunny Agrawal, Head of Fundamental Research at SBI Securities, said ""Defence stocks have corrected due to easing geopolitical concerns; however, this is largely a short-term, news-driven reaction. From a long-term perspective, the ability of defence companies to deliver healthy earnings growth remains intact. I do not believe that any easing of geopolitical tensions will lead to a reduction in India’s defence budget. While there may be a temporary sentimental impact due to improved geopolitical conditions, the long-term growth potential continues to remain very strong. Any dip should be viewed as a buying opportunity in quality defence stocks for long-term investors."" Trump said he had been informed that killings during Iran’s crackdown on protests were easing and that there was no current plan for large-scale executions. He adopted a wait-and-see approach after earlier threatening intervention. Antigovernment protests across Tehran have eased since Monday, when hundreds of thousands of people attended pro-government demonstrations. Iran has also reopened its airspace after a nearly five-hour closure that had disrupted flights across the region amid concerns over possible military action. According to people inside Iran contacted by Reuters on Wednesday and Thursday, protests appeared to have abated since Monday. On the stock-specific front, Astra Microwave Products emerged as the biggest laggard in the Nifty Defence index, sliding up to 3 percent. BEL and Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders declined by up to 2.4 percent and 2 percent, respectively. Cochin Shipyard, Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd, Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers and Data Patterns (India) also slipped up to 2 percent.

"HPCL, BPCL, IOC shares jump up to 4% over oil price decline as US-Iran tensions ease",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/hpcl-bpcl-ioc-shares-jump-up-to-4-as-oil-prices-decline-after-trump-assures-iran-of-no-us-strike-13775703.html,"The shares of oil marketing companies (OMC) jumped in trade on January 16 as oil prices extended decline. This came as concerns around supply risks eased amid lower expectations of a US strike on Iran. Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) shares surged nearly 4 percent to trade at Rs 456.50 apiece, snapping a two-session losing streak. Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) shares meanwhile rose over 3 percent to Rs 367.75 apiece, and Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) shares gained around 2 percent to Rs 162.15 apiece. Why are oil prices falling? Oil prices have extended losses after US President Donald Trump signaled that he may hold off on attacking Iran for now. He said that he has been assured that Iran would stop killing protesters, reducing the likelihood of an immediate US military response to the demonstrations against the government of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and of disruptions to Iranian production and key shipping lanes. ""Despite the steady drumbeat of geopolitical risks and macro speculation, the underlying balance still points to ample supply ... unless we see a genuine revival in Chinese demand or a meaningful bottleneck in physical barrel flows, oil looks range-bound, with Brent broadly hovering between $57 and $67,” Reuters quoted Phillip Nova senior market analyst Priyanka Sachdeva as saying. Brent crude fell more than 4 cents to $63.72. Analysts however have advised caution, highlighting the volatility still remains high. ""While (Iranian supply) risks have eased somewhat, they remain significant, keeping the market nervous in the short term,"" IG analysts said in a client note, cited by Reuters. How will OMCs perform in Q3? The state-run OMCs are likely to register strong Q3 results on the back of healthy refining margins, according to analysts. In the Oct-December quarter of FY26, average oil prices declined by 6 percent on a sequential basis and 10 percent from the same period last year, while retail prices were unchanged. “Due to elevated product cracks, refining margins will be sharply higher and implied marketing earnings weaker,” Kotak Institutional Equities said in its report. Motilal Oswal expects the standalone EBITDA for Hindustan Petroleum, Bharat Petroleum, and Indian Oil to increase 9-18 percent on a sequential basis, due to strong refining margins and receipt of LPG compensation.

"IT stocks surge up to 6% on strong Infosys Q3 results, Nifty IT index hits three-week high",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/it-stocks-surge-up-to-6-on-strong-infosys-q3-results-nifty-it-index-hits-three-week-high-13775632.html,"The shares of IT companies jumped in trade on January 16 as strong Q3 earnings of Infosys boosted investor sentiment. The Nifty IT index jumped more than 3 percent to 39,099.95, emerging as the top sectoral gainer on the market today. The index which was the worst performing sector in 2025, has now recorded the sharpest gains in three weeks. Infosys Q3 Results: Infosys shares led gains, jumping nearly 6 percent to trade at Rs 1,693 apiece. This comes after Infosys reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 6,654 crore for Q3 FY26, marking a 2.2 percent year-on-year (YoY) fall from the Rs 6,806 crore net profit reported in Q3 FY25. This however included Rs 1,289-crore one-time cost on account of new labour codes. The IT major’s revenue from operations meanwhile rose 9 percent YoY to Rs 45,479 crore. The company revised its fiscal ending 2026 revenue growth forecast upwards to 3-3.5 percent, from an earlier estimate of 2-3 percent. Other IT gainers today: Oracle Financial Services Software and LTIMindtree shares gained more than 5 percent each. Notably, LTIMindtree said it has been awarded the Insight 2.0 project by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) to build an AI-powered programme for the modernisation of India’s national tax analytics platform. The project, which is expected to be completed within seven years, is valued at around Rs 3,000 crore. Tech Mahindra and Mphasis shares gained around 5 percent each, while Wipro shares were up more than 3 percent. Tech Mahindra and Wipro are set to release their results for the October-December quarter of the ongoing FY26 later today. Persistent Systems and Coforge shares gained around 3 percent, while Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and HCLTech shares rose over 2 percent each. What lies ahead for IT sector? Axis Securities remained ‘cautiously optimistic’ for the Indian IT sector. It noted that Infosys’ sequential growth trajectory suggests a stable environment rather than an improving one. “From a near-term perspective, global uncertainties will keep overall growth muted. However, the company’s core efficiencies, investments, and deal momentum across regions will support the overall business over the next couple of quarters,” the domestic brokerage said. Infosys’ latest print matters because it is less about a one-quarter beat and more about a demand inflection signal, said Harshal Dasani Business Head INVasset PMS. The analyst said that the company raising its guidance and positive management commentary came at time when the market was questioning the durability of the IT cycle. That helped lift the Nifty IT index meaningfully in today’s session and provided a sentiment tailwind to the broader market. “The setup is encouraging because IT valuations had become more reasonable after underperformance, and even modest upgrades can trigger short-covering. However, a sustained index breakout needs earnings breadth beyond IT—financials, consumption, and industrial capex must also deliver. So, Infosys can be a catalyst for confidence, but new highs are ultimately a function of aggregate earnings visibility and global liquidity,” he added. A positive earnings outcome and a better outlook help signal that demand conditions in key overseas markets may be stabilizing, which supports overall risk appetite, said Ravi Singh, Chief Research Officer at Master Capital Services. He added that as confidence builds, this could lead to short-term momentum not only in IT but also in other industries. Follow all LIVE updates from the stock markets here."

Focus on expanding hotels (segmental GTV up ~16.6% y/y in H1FY26 vs. overall ~7.2% y/y GTV growth), international market presence (added 23 countries in the last 18 months), signs of stabilisation in India business (expecting high-single-to-early-double-digit y/y growth in Q3 and thereafter vs. flat-to-declining y/y trajectory in last 3-5 quarters), increased contribution from new travel agents (~6.9% of GTV in H1FY26 vs. ~4.3% in H1FY25) would be key enablers. We also expect EBITDA margin to expand from Q4 onwards, as investment in key account managers taper off with operating leverage kicking in amid y/y slowdown in SG&A growth. Outlook Thus, incorporating Classic Vacations from H2FY26 (contributing ~10% to consol. GTV), we retain BUY rating on TBO Tek with an upwardly revised TP of Rs2,000 (from Rs1,725 earlier), valuing it at ~41x FY28e EPS (vs ~46x Sep’27e EPS earlier). Premium multiple is justified due to its focus on the high margin premium travel sector & asset light model with negative working capital cycle.

MF yield improved slightly QoQ to 47.6bps despite equity growth while share of non-MF revenue was stable at ~9.0%. Led by strong equity performance in 1/3-yr buckets, market share in net equity flows remains highest at 18.2% in 9MFY26 (15.2% in FY25). Hence stock market share in equity increased by 28bps QoQ to 13.9%. ICICIAMC could better navigate the impact of 5bps TER reduction due to lower commission payout and lesser ND share in equity distribution. Conservatively, we have factored a 2.0-3.0bps decline in equity yields over FY26-28E (vs no fall in FY26). Re-appointment of Mr. Sankaran Naren as the Executive Director for a term of 2 years, w.e.f. 1st Jul’26 to 30th Jun’28 mitigates the KMP risk.

CRR cut/better liquidity management drove rise in reported NIM by 9bps QoQ to 2.76%. However, due to repo cut and catch up in deposit growth, NIM may fall and bottom out in Q4FY26E. Gross slippage ratio was lower at 84bps (PLe 1.1%) while recovery was healthier resulting in negative net slippage that led to lower standard asset and loan loss provisions. Transition impact of ECL is estimated at Rs42-43bn and bank does not expect material effect as bank has enough PCR buffer while 95% of corporate book is rated BBB & above.

Led by strong equity performance in 1/3-yr buckets, market share in net equity flows remains healthy and is second highest at 15.4% in 9MFY26 (12.9% in FY25). Hence stock market share in equity increased by 10bps QoQ to 12.93%. Due to strong pedigree and superior 3-yr performance HDFCAMC could benefit from increased flows.

Additionally, the growing client interest in embedding AI into business functions and processes partially supporting the overall topline growth. The large deal TCV was encouraging at USD4.8b (+60% QoQ) in Q3, even excluding the NHS deal (~USD1.6b), it exceeded Q2 wins that translates 9MFY26 deal TCV growth of 30% YoY. The management was hinting a positive outlook for FY27, where it expects BFSI and ER&U to contribute substantially to the topline on the back of notable wins and pick up in discretionary spends. The encouraging deal TCV, green shoots in discretionary and growing traction around advanced AI are setting up strong foundation for better revenue growth in FY27E/FY28E. On margins, we are keeping a tight band due to having higher appetite for investments in S&M, hiring/re-skilling AI talents and incremental cost of Labour Code, which partly get offset by project Maximus.

The index gained around 1 percent to 60,160.85 in the morning trading hours of Friday. This marks the first time the index has crossed the key psychological mark of 60,000 in five sessions. Federal Bank shares were the top gainers on the index today, jumping around 6 percent to trade at Rs 261.35 apiece. The lender is set to release its results for the October-December quarter of FY26 today. AU Small Finance Bank shares gained more than 3 percent, while Yes Bank, Punjab National Bank (PNB) and Canara Bank shares gained over 2 percent each.

Technical view on Bank Nifty: Aakash Shah, Technical Research Analyst at Choice Equity Broking said that 59,900–60,000 is now a crucial resistance cluster, adding that a sustained move above this could revive short-term bullishness. Notably, the crucial mark has already been broken by the index, On the downside, the analyst believes that 59,300–59,400 is key support, and a break below may trigger further consolidation. Axis Securities meanwhile said that the trend-deciding level for the day is 59,567. “If Bank Nifty trades above this level, it may rally up to 59810-60039-60282 levels. However, if it trades below 59567 levels, we may witness profit booking in the market, and the index may correct up to 59337-59095-58865 levels,” the brokerage said. Dhupesh Dhameja, Derivatives Research Analyst at SAMCO Securities, had also suggested that 60,000 was the key resistance level, which is a key breakout level. “From a technical perspective, the index continues to witness buying interest on declines, particularly around the psychologically important 59,500 zone. However, the broader price structure remains range-bound. Nifty Bank is currently oscillating within a wide band of 58,800–60,000, and a decisive move beyond either end of this range is likely to determine the next directional trend,” he added.

As a part of the restructuring exercise, 1,563 operating rooms of Lemon Tree will be transferred to Fleur.

We believe the fee income business has a potential to command higher multiple as it will be asset-light, debt free, capital efficient and margin lucrative (flowthrough to EBITDA is 70%+). On the other hand, the asset heavy business will witness a fund infusion up to Rs9.6bn from Warburg Pincus that can act as a growth capital.

Management anticipates F&O market share to expand going ahead led by normalisation in customer wallet share. Management anticipates earnings momentum to improve going ahead driven by increased FII and retail participation after a tepid market. Operating profit margin are expected to revive to 40%-45% range by the exit of 4QFY26."" Broking orders during the quarter grew 6 percent quarter-on-quarter to 380 million, while revenue per broking order increased 5 percent to Rs 16. EBITDA margin stood at 39 percent, supporting broking revenues, JM Financial said in a note. While the period-end client funding book remained flat, the average client funding book grew 11 percent quarter-on-quarter, leading to strong interest income, the brokerage added. Angel One maintained its sequential growth momentum during the quarter, with a recovery in futures and options activity and a sharp rise in commodity trading offsetting the impact of market volatility on retail cash activity, according to Motilal Oswal Financial Services Limited (MOFSL). Meanwhile, shares of Billionbrains Garage Ventures, the parent company of stockbroking platform Groww, rose as much as 9.4 percent to an intraday high of Rs 179.78. The stock has gained for the past two sessions and is up nearly 10 percent over the period. MOFSL said it has raised its FY27 and FY28 earnings per share estimates by 2 percent each, citing strong expansion in the margin trading facility book and a better-than-expected launch of the commodities segment. The brokerage maintained its ‘Buy’ rating on the stock with a revised target price of Rs 190. On a sequential basis, profit after tax grew 16 percent from Rs 471 crore reported in the September quarter. The year-on-year decline was largely due to a one-time post-tax gain of Rs 315 crore recorded in the year-ago period. Excluding this exceptional item, operating profit after tax rose 24 percent year-on-year to Rs 442 crore. The global brokerage Jefferies recommended a ""Buy"" rating to the stock, increasing the price target to Rs 195 from Rs 190. It said that the new ventures are ramping up faster than expected. The adjusted PAT and revenue beat was led by higher-than expected commodity & margin trading facility revenues, it added. Meanwhile, brokerage Citi also gave a 'Buy' rating to the stock, with Rs 195 as the price target as the company delivered solid Q3.

"LTIMindtree shares jump over 4% today after Rs 3,000-crore CBDT order win for AI-powered tax programme",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/ltimindtree-shares-jump-over-4-today-after-rs-3-000-crore-cbdt-order-win-for-ai-powered-tax-programme-13775251.html,"Shares of LTIMindtree rallied sharply on Friday, climbing more than 4 percent to hit the day’s high after the IT services company announced a large, long-tenure government order linked to India’s tax administration modernisation programme. LTIMindtree stock surged to a high of around Rs 6,290 in late-morning deals, up about 4.3 percent for the day. The rally pushed the stock to its session high and came amid strong volumes in the IT pack. At current levels, LTIMindtree commands a market capitalisation of about Rs 1.86 lakh crore. Even after Friday’s surge, the stock is up just under 5 percent over the past one year. It has underperforming the Nifty 50, which has gained around 11 percent over the same period. In a press release filed with the stock exchanges, the company said it has been awarded the Insight 2.0 project by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) to build an AI-powered programme for the modernisation of India’s national tax analytics platform. The mandate is valued at around Rs 3,000 crore and spans seven years, providing long-term revenue visibility. The project will focus on deploying advanced digital architecture and data analytics. Investors appeared to react positively to both the size and duration of the deal, with the order reinforcing LTIMindtree’s credentials in the public sector. The long contract tenor was also seen as supportive for medium-term earnings visibility. Friday’s move in LTIMindtree also played out against a stronger backdrop for IT stocks more broadly. Buying interest picked up across the sector after Infosys stock surged more than 5 percent, its biggest single-day gain in about four months, following its Q3 FY26 results and an upward revision in revenue growth guidance. The improved sentiment triggered both fresh buying and short-covering in several IT names, lending additional support to LTIMindtree’s rally. From a valuation standpoint, LTIMindtree trades at a TTM price-to-earnings multiple of about 38.2, with a dividend yield of roughly 1 percent, metrics that have kept the stock in focus for investors assessing risk-reward after a period of relative underperformance versus the broader market.

"Larsen & Toubro shares rise 1% today as company wins large hydrocarbon order worth Rs 2,500-5,000 crore",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/larsen-toubro-shares-rise-1-today-as-company-wins-large-hydrocarbon-order-worth-rs-2-500-5-000-crore-13775141.html,"Shares of Larsen & Toubro Ltd (L&T) rose as much as 1 percent on Friday after the engineering and construction major announced a ‘large’ order win for its hydrocarbon onshore business, helping steady sentiment following recent volatility around overseas project-related headlines. L&T stock was trading 1.02 percent higher at Rs 3,905.4 in morning trade on NSE. At current levels, the stock is up about 11.3 percent over the past one year, broadly in line with the Nifty 50’s gains. The company commands a market capitalisation of around Rs 5.36 lakh crore. L&T stock trades at a price-to-earnings multiple of about 32.7 times. In an exchange filing on Friday, L&T said its hydrocarbon onshore business vertical has secured a large order from Petronet LNG, a joint venture promoted by ONGC, Indian Oil, GAIL and BPCL. The project will be executed on a lump-sum turnkey basis and involves engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning of LNG/ethane and propane double-wall storage tanks at the Dahej petrochemical complex in Gujarat. The scope of work includes a 170,000 cubic metre LNG/ethane storage tank and a 140,000 cubic metre propane storage tank, along with ethane and propane handling and despatch facilities to support the downstream propane dehydrogenation and polypropylene plant. L&T classified the contract as a ‘large’ order, implying a value in the range of Rs 2,500 crore to Rs 5,000 crore. The project forms part of India’s first petrochemical complex integrating cold energy utilisation from an LNG terminal and is aimed at strengthening domestic petrochemical manufacturing capacity. Friday’s order announcement comes after L&T earlier this week sought to reassure investors over reports related to possible cancellation of oil project tenders in Kuwait. The company had clarified that the projects referred to in those media reports were not part of its order book, following which the stock had pared intraday losses. L&T has also remained in focus in recent sessions after announcing another ‘large’ order earlier this week for its heavy civil infrastructure business, involving the construction of India’s largest pumped storage project in Maharashtra.

"Cipla stock crashes over 3% as brokerages cut targets on Lanreotide disruption, FY27 risks",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/cipla-stock-crashes-over-3-as-brokerages-cut-targets-on-lanreotide-disruption-fy27-risks-13775001.html,"Shares of Cipla Ltd fell sharply on Friday and extended recent weakness, after a series of cautious brokerage notes flagged earnings risks from supply disruptions in its key US product Lanreotide and intensifying competition in other generics. Cipla stock dropped 3.48 percent to Rs 1,384.6 in early trade. The stock is now down about 4 percent over the past one year, sharply underperforming the Nifty 50, which has risen over 10 percent during the same period. The decline comes after Cipla disclosed that manufacturing of Lanreotide has been temporarily paused to support USFDA remediation at its European contract manufacturing partner. Lanreotide is among Cipla’s top three products in the US and accounts for about $150 million in annual revenue, with the company holding a 22 percent market share in the product. Morgan Stanley maintained its Underweight stance on the stock and cut its target price to Rs 1,292 per share. The brokerage warned that the phase-out of gRevlimid and supply disruptions in Lanreotide are likely to weigh on performance, particularly in Q4 FY26. It trimmed earnings estimates by 2 percent for FY26 and 1 percent for FY27, cautioning that any prolonged disruption could result in market share loss and downside risk to FY27 and FY28 earnings. Nuvama also turned more cautious, downgrading Cipla to Reduce and lowering its target price to Rs 1,360 per share. Nuvama said the expiry of gRevlimid exclusivity, uncertainty around Lanreotide supplies, and rising competition for Cipla’s proposed generic Advair following a recent approval for Lannett pose an earnings challenge for FY27. The brokerage noted that Cipla’s European contract manufacturer Pharmathen has temporarily paused production for remediation, with manufacturing expected to restart only in the first half of FY27, adding near-term uncertainty. Cipla has said that the Lanreotide manufacturing halt is linked to remediation efforts following a US Food and Drug Administration inspection at Pharmathen’s Rodopi facility in Greece, which resulted in nine observations. The company has indicated that resupply of Lanreotide is expected to resume in the first half of FY27 and that it is closely monitoring supply levels. Not all brokerages are bearish. Nomura believes the potential loss of Lanreotide sales has largely been priced in, noting that the stock is already down about 6.5 percent since the issue first came to light earlier this month. Nomura has maintained a Buy rating with a target price of Rs 1,770. However, the dominant tone around Cipla remains cautious.

"Infosys shares jump over 5% after Q3 results; brokerages upbeat on guidance hike, deal wins",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/infosys-shares-jump-over-4-after-q3-results-brokerages-upbeat-on-guidance-hike-deal-wins-13774937.html,"Shares of Infosys Ltd rallied sharply on Friday, rising over 5 percent, as investors reacted positively to the IT major’s Q3 FY26 results, a raised revenue growth outlook, and upbeat brokerage commentary following a strong rally in its US-listed ADRs. Infosys stock climbed 5.14 percent to a high or Rs 1,682.1 in early trade, marking a firm rebound after the company’s earnings announcement earlier this week. The stock had ended the previous session at Rs 1,608.9 on the NSE. The buying interest comes despite Infosys reporting a 2.2 percent year-on-year decline in consolidated net profit for the fiscal third quarter, which was weighed down by a one-time labour code-related charge. Investors appeared to look past the headline profit miss, focusing instead on steady constant-currency revenue growth, resilient adjusted margins, and robust large-deal momentum. Infosys raised its FY26 revenue growth guidance to 3-3.5 percent in constant currency terms, citing improving demand visibility and strong execution, while maintaining its operating margin outlook. Large deal wins stood at $4.8 billion during the quarter, including two mega deals, supporting medium-term revenue visibility. Sentiment was also supported by a sharp rally in Infosys’ American Depository Receipts, which jumped about 8 percent over two US trading sessions following the results, signalling a positive offshore investor response. Brokerages reiterated bullish views on the stock after the earnings announcement. CLSA maintained an ‘Outperform’ rating on Infosys with a target price of Rs 1,779 per share, while HSBC reiterated its ‘Buy’ call with a higher target price of Rs 1,870 per share, citing improving demand commentary, greater clarity on AI-led spending, and stabilising US corporate sentiment. Despite Friday’s sharp rebound, Infosys shares remain down about 13 percent over the past one year, underperforming the Nifty 50, which has risen more than 10 percent over the same period. Brokerages say that this has kept the stock firmly on investors' radar for a potential re-rating.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Hindustan Zinc, Punjab National Bank, Tata Steel, MCX India, Laurus Labs, and others on January 16?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-hindustan-zinc-punjab-national-bank-tata-steel-mcx-inida-laurus-labs-and-others-on-january-16-13774581.html,"Equity benchmarks recorded a one-third percent loss, continuing the downtrend for the second consecutive session on January 14, with moderately weakening market breadth. A total of 1,498 shares saw selling pressure compared to 1,385 shares that gained on the NSE. The market may remain range-bound until it decisively breaks the current week’s high–low range. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Nilesh Jain, Head – Technical and Derivatives Research Analyst (Equity Research) at Centrum Broking Hindustan Zinc | CMP: Rs 654.2 Hindustan Zinc continues to remain in a strong uptrend, consistently forming higher tops and higher bottoms. It is trading well above both short-term and long-term moving averages, indicating sustained strength. After witnessing consolidation over the past couple of weeks, the stock has now delivered a fresh breakout, which is supported by higher-than-average volumes, reinforcing the bullish outlook. From a derivatives perspective, the addition of fresh long positions further strengthens the positive bias. Considering the overall technical setup, the stock appears well-positioned to move towards the Rs 700 level in the near term, while crucial support is placed at Rs 621. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 700 Stop-Loss: Rs 621 Punjab National Bank | CMP: Rs 128.68 Punjab National Bank gave a fresh breakout from an ascending triangle pattern on the daily chart. It surpassed double-top resistance and ended at 52-week highs. The sharp price up-move is backed by significantly higher volumes, which validates the bullish setup. Momentum indicators are also supportive, with the RSI moving above the 65 mark and the MACD generating a bullish crossover, indicating improving upward momentum. Overall, the technical structure suggests the stock is well placed to move towards the Rs 140 level in the near term, while immediate support is seen near Rs 123. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 140 Stop-Loss: Rs 123 Polycab India | CMP: Rs 7,323.5 Polycab India earlier formed a double-top pattern and has since been making lower highs and lower lows, indicating a weakening price structure. It has also slipped below all its key short-term moving averages, reinforcing the bearish bias. Currently, the stock is on the verge of breaking down from its rising trendline, with immediate support placed near Rs 7,250. A decisive breach below this level could accelerate selling pressure and drag the stock towards the Rs 6,800 zone. The bearish outlook would be invalidated only if the stock manages to sustain a move above Rs 7,560 on the upside. From a derivatives perspective, the presence of fresh short build-up further supports the negative view. Considering the overall technical setup, the stock appears poised for a breakdown and is likely to drift towards the Rs 6,800 level in the near term. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 6,800 Stop-Loss: Rs 7,560 Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical and Derivatives Research at SBI Securities Tata Steel | CMP: Rs 189.25 The Nifty Metal index has been outperforming the frontline indices for the past few sessions, driven by strong buying interest in metal stocks. Tata Steel has delivered a significant technical breakout, forming a Cup and Handle pattern on the daily chart, which is considered a bullish continuation signal.

"Vishal Sikka warns of AI valuation gap, urges Indian IT to evolve",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/vishal-sikka-warns-of-ai-valuation-gap-urges-indian-it-to-evolve-alpha-article-13773914.html,"The current valuations in the artificial intelligence sector do not add up, creating a significant gap between capital expenditure and revenue generation, according to Vishal Sikka, founder and CEO of Vianai Systems. In an interview with CNBC TV18, Sikka -- former CEO of Infosys -- warned of a hype cycle, noting that the economics of the massive spending on AI infrastructure are not currently supported by revenues. Sikka explained the discrepancy by breaking down the numbers. He pointed out that while a company like Nvidia generates approximately $250 billion annually from its GPU sales, the total ecosystem spending, including CPUs, memory, and networking, swells this figure to about $750-$800 billion a year. To justify this expenditure over a four-year amortisation period, the industry would need to generate around $200 billion in new revenue. ""Where is the 200 billion? There is no 200 billion. OpenAI's revenue is 15 billion, something like that. And so there is a huge gap,"" Sikka stated. He questioned how long this gap would be funded, acknowledging that while one could call it a bubble, the current reality is that the economics ""don't add up to what has been spent."" Addressing the impact on India's information technology services sector, Sikka asserted that AI is already capable of effectively automating well-defined, structured activities such as software development, maintenance, and business process execution. This means a much smaller team equipped with AI can perform the work previously done by a larger group. He urged Indian IT companies to embrace this transformation, even if it leads to lower short-term economic gains. The key to navigating this shift, he advised, is for these firms to become software companies in addition to being services companies. ""It has to be your own software,"" he emphasized. By developing proprietary AI platforms, IT firms can retain value even as the number of billable hours for projects decreases. This necessitates a business model adjustment away from purely people-based pricing towards fixed-fee, outcome-based approaches that account for the value of the software itself. Looking at India's position in the global AI race, Sikka expressed strong optimism, citing the nation's ""demographic dividend."" He described AI as a powerful tool, much like others invented throughout human history, that can empower India's large, young, and educated population. ""The great mandate for us is how do we make all our people able to use these tools to build amazing things for themselves, for our country, but also for the world,"" he said. Sikka believes that if India can successfully equip its billion-strong population to use AI effectively, the country will thrive. Furthermore, Sikka called for greater participation in building foundational AI technologies within India. Dismissing the notion that the country has missed its opportunity, he compared the current stage of AI development to being in the ""first over of a T20 match."" He expressed a desire to see a great foundation model built in India and highlighted immense opportunities for innovation. Future advancements, according to Sikka, lie in creating vertical foundation models for specific industries like healthcare, models trained on India's diverse local languages, and sophisticated ""world models"" that can understand the physical world and activities specific to the Indian context, such as traffic patterns and infrastructure."
"India must build its own AI foundational models, says Vishal Sikka",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/india-must-build-its-own-ai-foundational-models-says-vishal-sikka-alpha-article-13773915.html,"Vishal Sikka, founder & CEO of Vianai Systems, has called for India to urgently develop its own foundational artificial intelligence models to avoid becoming a passive consumer of technology built elsewhere. In an interview with CNBC TV18, Sikka -- former CEO of Infosys -- emphasised that India is too large and the stakes too high for the nation to be absent from any layer of the AI ecosystem. ""We have to be central to AI ... at every layer, in every aspect of AI,"" Sikka stated, ahead of the India AI impact summit scheduled for next month. He argued that India possesses the capability to use and deliver AI at scale and should showcase its innovation and entrepreneurial spirit to the world. He said India must build its own foundation models, develop tools and applications on top, and enable hundreds of millions to deploy them, which are the core underpinning for platforms like ChatGPT. The former Infosys CEO highlighted a critical skill gap as a major challenge, describing the current global situation as a ""tale of two cities."" He noted that out of eight billion people worldwide, only about two million can build AI applications. The number shrinks dramatically to a few hundred thousand who can deploy AI in production, and fewer than 25,000 people on the entire planet possess the skills to create a frontier-level foundational model. ""These are not skills that are pre-ordained by God for a chosen few people… we have to really make these skills much more pervasive,"" he said. To address this, Sikka, who is on the board of Stanford's AI center, revealed that the upcoming summit will feature faculty from the university who will teach attendees how to build their own foundational models, aiming to proliferate the skill of building foundation models, which he argued can be learned. Sikka outlined a twofold concern regarding India's AI readiness. The first is the urgency to expand the skill base of people who understand AI's capabilities and limitations. The second is the imminent disruptive effect on key industries, particularly the IT services sector. He pointed out that Large Language Models (LLMs) are ""unreasonably effective at writing software,"" posing a direct challenge to traditional software development and maintenance roles. ""We have a short window of time in which to transform from the previous way of doing things to an AI-led way of doing things,"" Sikka warned, framing it as the most important equation for the times ahead. He stressed that the disruption is not a future event but is already happening. To illustrate the magnitude of the shift, he shared an anecdote of a complex system that took 15 experts nine months to build being replicated by a single person in just 14 days using modern AI tools. ""It is not a matter of when is it coming. It is here already,"" he asserted. Reflecting on his early decision to back OpenAI with a donation in 2015, he recalled that allocating resources to high-reward, unconventional ideas like these often seem ‘crazy’ at first. He urged a focus on the future, questioning what current opportunities might be missed today that will seem obvious in 2035. For him, the most significant imminent transformation lies in the complete overhaul of the IT landscape driven by AI."

Going forward, the mgmt guides to accelerate credit growth, led by the RAM segment. UNBK strategically shed bulk deposits, leading to lower CoF and thus 9bps QoQ margin improvement, but we believe core deposit growth remains a challenge for the bank (up ~0.5% YoY) and thus could keep margins in check amid another repo rate cut expected in 4Q. Overall NPA ratios are trending down, given contained fresh slippages and continued recovery in the corporate pool, but we believe the bank needs to accelerate ECL provisions.

"Chartist Talk: Ashish Kyal shares outlook for Vedanta, Union Bank, NALCO, MCX, Hindustan Copper, IndusInd Bank after sharp rally",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/chartist-talk-ashish-kyal-shares-outlook-for-vedanta-union-bank-nalco-mcx-hindustan-copper-indusind-bank-after-sharp-rally-13773715.html,"According to Ashish Kyal, the CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors, Hindustan Copper is currently approaching prior swing high of Rs 575 after taking a short breather. “Break above Rs 575 can extend the rally further towards Rs 600-650 levels,” he said in an interview to Moneycontrol. On NALCO, which gained 4.5% in last session, he is of view that as long as the stock does not see a close below prior day’s low, upside momentum is expected to continue with the upside targets of Rs 400 level or higher. He also shared his technical outlook on Union Ban of India, Vedanta, IndusInd Bank and MCX India after their strong rally in the recent session. On the Nifty 50, he feels Friday closing will decide trend for coming week and key levels to watch out for are 25,470 – 25,850 levels. Do you expect the Nifty 50 to break out of the 25,600–25,900 range of the past four days on the upside? Nifty since past 7 days has been failing to give a positive close above prior day’s high. Prices are witnessing selling pressure on upside and not able to cross above 25,850 on closing basis which is also high volume profile area. It will be important to see a close above this level by end of day on Friday which is next working day for upside breakout. On downside, any close below 25,470 by day-end will be sign of concern. Friday closing will decide trend for coming week and key levels to watch out for are 25,470 – 25,850 levels. The Bank Nifty has hovered around short-term moving averages over the last few days. Do you see the possibility of the banking index moving toward record highs rather than witnessing sharp selling pressure? Bank Nifty is holding 50 period EMA (Exponential moving average) and index is currently consolidating near the EMA support in between a range of 58,800-59,800. Consistent rally in PSU banks have limited downside movement in the Index. A break above 59,800 level can open doors for the targets of 60,400 followed by 61,000 levels. While a close below 58,800 can suggest that short term top has formed. Do you expect the record-high rally to continue in Vedanta, Union Bank of India, and MCX India? Vedanta has hit record highs on strong rise in commodity prices. However, after a 13% rally since January 2026, RSI is overbought, so dips can be used to buy as long as there is no close below the prior day’s low, with upside targets of Rs 730 or higher over the coming months. PSU banks continued to outperform. In the previous session, Union Bank of India surged nearly 8% post good quarterly results, forming a strong bullish candle for the first time in months. As long as the stock holds above Rs 165 level, the bias remains positive for upside targets of Rs 190 level or higher. Since September, Multi Commodity Exchange of India (MCX India) has been protecting prior week’s low on closing basis keeping bigger trend on sides of bulls. So, as long as key support of Rs 2,180 level remains protected on the downside one can use every decline to buy with the upside target of Rs 2,600 followed by Rs 2,800 level. Are you super bullish on Hindustan Copper and NALCO? Global uncertainties have caused huge rally in commodities such as gold, silver, aluminium, and copper to reach all-time high levels. Hindustan copper and NALCO which are directly linked to these metals, so both companies are directly benefitting from this rally. Hindustan Copper is currently approaching prior swing high of Rs 575 after taking a short breather and now a break above the same can extend the rally further towards Rs 600-650 levels with Rs 540 followed Rs 520 as immediate support levels. While NALCO is currently trading at the uncharted territory and has shown a sharp rally of nearly 13% within past one week. For now, as long as we do not see a close below prior day’s low, upside momentum is expected to continue with the upside targets of Rs 400 level or higher. On the downside, Rs 350 can act as an immediate support. Any break below it can result into short term profit booking. Do you think the Nifty Auto index is done with its correction and is expected to resume its upward journey soon? Nifty Auto index has lost most of its gains from recent rally and continued to drift lower by protecting prior day’s high on closing basis. The sector is currently standing at 50 EMA support of 27,700 level. A close below the same can accelerate further selling pressure towards 27,480 followed by 27,180 level. On the upside, a break above 28,180 can trigger short covering. Do you see a cup-and-handle pattern breakout in IndusInd Bank? If yes, does it indicate that the rally will continue? Yes, on the daily chart, IndusInd Bank has confirmed a breakout from a cup-and-handle pattern, followed by a successful retest, and has also moved above its prior swing high. Notably, volumes have picked up sharply for the first time since November 12, 2025, indicating strong participation and conviction in the ongoing move. As long as Rs 890 level remains protected on the downside, the rally is likely to extend further towards Rs 1,000 or higher. Do you expect the record-high rally to continue in the Nifty PSU Bank index? Since past one year, PSU Bank index has shown a clear outperformance as compared to Private Bank as it has surged by 30% in one year and continued to trade in a uncharted territory. This strong relative momentum suggests that the outperformance trend is likely to persist. On the upside, the index has the potential to move towards 9,000, followed by 9,200 levels, while 8,650 level remains a crucial support to watch."

Click to View More Outlook for January 16 Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities Today, the benchmark indices witnessed range-bound activity. The Nifty ended 67 points lower, while the Sensex was down by 245 points. Among sectors, Metal and PSU Bank indices rallied over 2 percent, whereas the IT index lost the most, shedding over 1 percent. Technically, after a muted open, the market registered narrow-range activity. On the lower side, it found support near 25,600/83200, while intraday profit booking was seen near 25,800/83800. We are of the view that the intraday market texture is non-directional; perhaps traders are waiting for either side to breakout. On the higher side, above 25,800/83800, the market could move up to 25,880-25,900/84000-84200. On the flip side, below 25,600/83200, selling pressure is likely to accelerate. If it falls below this level, it could retest the levels of 25,500-25,450/83000-82800. Gaurav Garg, Lemonn Markets Desk The benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty witnessed sharp intraday volatility on Wednesday as caution prevailed amid sustained foreign fund outflows and global tariff-related concerns. After slipping to early lows, domestic markets pared most of their losses on the back of selective value buying and traded largely flat by mid-afternoon. The Sensex fell to a low of 83,185.20 before recovering nearly 350 points to trade at 83,505.56, down 0.15 percent, while the Nifty hovered near the 25,700 level at 25,692.30, lower by 0.16 percent. Buying interest emerged in pockets such as metals, oil and gas, and consumer durables, helping limit the downside after recent corrections. Market sentiment remains fragile, with both indices having declined in six of the last seven sessions amid concerns over US tariff measures, geopolitical tensions and persistent foreign portfolio outflows. FPIs have sold nearly ₹16,600 crore worth of equities so far in January, following heavy outflows in 2025. Additional volatility was driven by the advancement of the weekly derivatives expiry to Wednesday, while positive cues from Asian markets provided some support. From a technical perspective, the Nifty managed to hold above the 25,620–25,715 support zone. A sustained move above 25,715 could trigger a recovery towards 26,020, while a break below 25,600 may open the downside towards 25,300.

L&T shares extend fall as JM Financial trims firm's order inflow forecast on $8.7-bn Kuwait tender uncertainty,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/l-t-shares-extend-fall-as-jm-financial-trims-firm-s-order-inflow-forecast-on-8-7-bn-kuwait-tender-uncertainty-13772675.html,"JM Financial issued a cautious note for Larsen & Toubro (L&T), stating that the uncertainty around Kuwait reportedly cancelling a few tenders can cloud order inflow visibility for the engineering major. The shares of the company extended decline for the fifth consecutive session on January 14. Kuwait mulls cancellation of oil project tenders worth $8.7 bn, says report: Kuwait is discussing plans to cancel oil project tenders worth $8.7 billion, media company MEED reported citing people familiar with the matter. It added that Kuwait's discussions come after bids for several contracts came in well above the budget, raising concerns over cost efficiency and fiscal impact. According to analysts quoted by CNBC-TV18, L&T was the lowest bidder in tenders worth more than $4.5 billion. Moneycontrol couldn't independently verify the report. L&T clarifies: The company clarified that the said that the projects referred to in the media reports were not part of the company’s order book. ""Further, the Company can’t comment on the status of tenders or commercial decisions of its Clients,"" it added. JM Financial on L&T: In its note, JM Financial said it has noted earlier that L&T is well-placed in $5-billion worth of tenders in Kuwait. Thus, any potential delay or cancellation of these bids may adversely impact its order inflows, the domestic brokerage said. It still expects L&T to meet its FY26 order inflow growth guidance of 10 percent YoY due to the firm’s April-December order inflows of Rs 3.2 trillion and strong prospects for Q4 FY26. However, it cut its core order inflow estimates by 5-6 percent for FY26-28 to account for possible delay/cancellation in the Kuwait tenders. “This leads to ~3% cut in our core FY28E EBITDA; thus, a 3% fall in the stock price on 13th Jan’26 largely factors in such a deferral,” the brokerage said. Notably, the stock fell as much as 4.5 percent on November 13, before recovering some losses. JM Financial maintained its ‘Buy’ rating for the stock with a target price of Rs 4,500 per share, implying an upside potential of nearly 16 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. L&T share price: L&T shares fell 0.6 percent to trade at Rs 3,863.90 apiece, as seen at 1.20 pm. The stock has fallen around 7 percent in the past five days, and nearly 6 percent in the past one month. It however increased 11 percent in the past six months, and 12 percent in the past one year. The stock currently has a P/E ratio of 27.93, and a market capitalization of nearly Rs 5.32 lakh crore. Follow all LIVE updates from the stock markets here."

Real estate stocks fall for 7th straight day: Analysts say D-Street is factoring in a likely slump due to IT layoffs,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/real-estate-stocks-fall-for-7th-straight-day-analysts-say-d-street-is-factoring-in-a-slump-due-to-it-layoffs-13772416.html,"The shares of real estate companies dropped in trade on January 14, recording a decline for the seventh consecutive session. Analysts have collectively highlighted how sustained IT layoffs may continue to impact the sector, and what lies ahead. The sharp fall in the share prices pushed the Nifty Realty index down around 1.7 percent to hit a near nine-month low of 843.60 in the morning trading hours of Wednesday. The sectoral index fell a combined 8% in the last seven trading sessions. Top realty losers today: Signatureglobal (India) shares dropped over 2 percent, while Prestige Estates shares fell around 2 percent. Macrotech Developers (Lodha), Brigade Enterprises and Phoenix Mills shares fell more than 1 percent each on January 14. Anant Raj and Godrej Properties shares fell around 1 percent each, while Sobha shares were down in the red with marginal losses. Bucking the trend, Oberoi Realty and DLF shares were trading in the green with marginal gains. Are IT layoffs behind the downturn? Indian IT sector has seen mass layoffs last year, which have now spilled over to this year. In July last year, Moneycontrol exclusively reported that the IT behemoth Tata Consultancy Services will be letting go of 2 percent of its workforce, or roughly over 12,000 employees, over 2026, in a bid to become more agile and future-ready amid rapid disruptions in technology. India’s largest IT services company on January 12 said that it has released 6,000 employees in Q2, and around 1,800 employees in December quarter. HCLTech, which also released its Q3 results on January 12, reported a net reduction of 261 employees during the quarter, taking its total employee base to 2,26,379 at the end of the December. However, the company didn't mention how many of these employees voluntarily exited and how many were laid off. According to analysts, the IT layoffs have impacted housing demand in key areas, thereby impacting the stocks. IT layoffs are likely to be the major reason for the low demand in the luxury segment of urban centers like Bangalore and Hyderabad as they will be discouraging the high-income buyers, said Shashank Gupta, Director, RPS Group. He added that mid-to-premium housing sales, which have already dropped 15 percent year-on-year, will continue to be affected negatively as the professionals will not be willing to upgrade, opting instead to rent amid such job uncertainties. ""The market has whispered to the executives with Nifty Realty down by 20% from the peaks and talking about the disruption posed by the AI, which also indicates that 30% of the IT jobs that are luxury demand would get stifled due to the automation by 2027. The stock corrections that are expected to be around 5-7% are dependent on the RBI rate cuts and policy revamps that could fuel the market by the second quarter of 2026,"" the analyst said. Keshav Mangla, GM Business Development at Forteasia Realty, cited Anarock data to explain that financial tech layoffs of more than 1 lakh since 2024 have already resulted in a 12 percent drop in the demand for Tier-1 cities, thus resulting in developers' difficulties in managing cash flows and having to sell off their inventory. 'A double-edged sword for real estate stocks': ""The stock market does not seem to be giving enough attention to the AI threat; the tools for generative AI are expected to take away 20-25% of the coding jobs which can bring down the HNI investments that are responsible for 30% of luxury property launches,"" Mangla said. The continuous IT layoffs, which are expected to reach 2,00,000 by FY27, are a double-edged sword for real estate stocks which are currently at multi-month lows, said Anurag Goel, Director, Goel Ganga Developments. He explained that this was because the IT layoffs will cause a further reduction in purchasing power in the markets relying mostly on IT where 35 percent of home loans are taken out. What is in store for the future? ""The lowest ever prices for Brigade and Sobha indicate the investors' fears about the prolonged sales stagnation, as the number of launches in Q3 2025 has declined by 18%. The stock market is taking into account the AI risks only to a certain extent since companies like Infosys that are hyperscalers are moving towards automating and thus, displacing the mid-level talent and consequently, the demand for flats costing Rs 10 lakh-Rs 30 lakh is being affected,"" Goel said. ""A slight hopefulness,"" said Goel while speaking about what lies ahead. However, he expects the real estate stocks to decline by another 8 to 10 percent more in the absence of a stimulus. Is there a silver lining? While headlines around IT layoffs and AI-led efficiency gains have raised concerns, the market is already discounting a slowdown in incremental office demand rather than a collapse, said Harshal Dasani, Business Head, INVasset PMS. ""AI is more a productivity lever than a demand destroyer at this stage. It may change how space is used, but it does not eliminate the need for physical offices, especially in collaborative and client-facing roles,"" Dasani explained. He added that residential demand remains supported by stable employment outside pure tech, improving balance sheets, and low speculative supply. ""Near-term consolidation is possible, but structurally, the sector is adjusting—not breaking,"" the analyst said. Follow all LIVE updates from the stock markets here."

Q3 VNB margin improved to 24.4% driven by an increase in retail protection volume.

The sharp uptick in Transportation is a combination of ramp up in anchor account along with a spending recovery in strategic top accounts, ex-top 10 accounts declined 7.5% in USD. The OEMs’ participation is inclined towards costs savings instead of focusing on the innovation and growth areas. The M&C and H&L performance was discouraging and reported third consecutive quarters of decline. We believe the underlying spending pattern within M&C and H&L is sporadic, attributed to the structural issues, and would require couple of more quarters to achieve a steady state. The management was confident of reviving growth within these two verticals on the back of new logo additions and few closures that concluded in Q3. On margin, it exceeded our estimate by 140bps QoQ. At the current margin, the utilization stood at ~75%, it aspires to achieve 85% utilization with a combination of deploying automation and AI. Additionally, we believe the decoupling of revenue growth and talent hiring would provide incremental margins levers.

Did Kotak Mahindra Bank stock really crash 80 percent today? Here’s why investors must not worry,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/did-kotak-mahindra-bank-stock-really-crash-80-percent-today-here-s-why-investors-must-not-worry-13772245.html,"Shares of Kotak Mahindra Bank appeared to plunge more than 80 percent on Wednesday, January 14. However, the dramatic fall is entirely optical and linked to the bank’s 5:1 stock split, which came into effect today. Kotak Mahindra Bank shares are trading ex-split today, with the face value reduced to Re 1 per share from Rs 5. As part of the corporate action, one existing equity share has been sub-divided into five equity shares, with the stock price adjusting proportionately. Why Kotak Mahindra Bank stock shows 80 percent fall, and where it really stands On platforms that do not automatically adjust historical prices for the split, the stock appears to be down nearly 80 percent. This is simply the mathematical adjustment from the pre-split price to the post-split price, not a sell-off. Once adjusted for the split, Kotak Mahindra Bank stock was trading around Rs 419-420, down about 1.6 percent on the day. On a split-adjusted basis, Kotak Mahindra Bank shares are trading comfortably within their recent range, with a 52-week low of about Rs 346 and a high near Rs 460. The bank’s market capitalisation, adjusted for the split, is around Rs 83,500 crore, and the stock is up over 9 percent over the past one year. What happens to investors’ shares in their demat accounts For shareholders, the split does not change the value of their investment. Instead, it changes the number of shares held and the price per share. If an investor held 1 share of Kotak Mahindra Bank before the split, that holding automatically becomes 5 shares in the demat account after the record date. Correspondingly, the share price adjusts to roughly one-fifth of the earlier level. The total investment value remains the same, barring normal market fluctuations. No action is required from investors. The additional shares are credited automatically to demat accounts, and the revised quantity becomes visible once the corporate action is fully processed by the depositories. The split is primarily aimed at improving liquidity and affordability, making the stock more accessible to a wider set of retail investors without altering fundamentals. Kotak Mahindra Bank’s stock split history This is not the first time the lender has split its shares: January 14, 2026: Face value reduced from Rs 5 to Re 1 (5:1 split)September 13, 2010: Face value reduced from Rs 10 to Rs 5 (2:1 split) In both instances, the objective was to enhance trading liquidity and broaden investor participation, without impacting the underlying valuation. Kotak Mahindra Bank stock call: ‘Buy’ Separately, brokerage commentary on Kotak Mahindra Bank shares continues to be driven by medium-term fundamentals rather than today’s corporate action. An HDFC Securities institutional research report this week maintained a constructive view on the lender’s stock. The report pointed to steady growth prospects, improving deposit quality, and resilient profitability, even as the bank navigates trade-offs between growth, margins, and asset quality. The brokerage reiterated a ‘Buy’ stance with a sum-of-the-parts target price of Rs 2,500 (pre-split), reflecting confidence in the franchise despite sector-wide challenges.

"Asian shares post small gain, Yen weakens past 159",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/asian-shares-post-small-gain-yen-weakens-past-159-13771713.html,"Asian shares posted a modest gain at the open, while Japanese equities extended their record-breaking run fueled by a weaker yen. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average advanced 0.9%, with the Japanese currency slipping past the 159-per-dollar level to the weakest since July 2024. Stocks in the country have jumped and the currency fallen amid reports of a snap election. Shares in South Korea edged up, having posted a gain on every trading day of 2026. In Tuesday’s US session, the S&P 500 fell from an all-time high, as JPMorgan Chase & Co. led a slide in lenders after its investment-banking fees missed guidance. US benchmarks dropped after December inflation data did little to dent expectations that the Federal Reserve will pause interest-rate cuts. Traders are going into Wednesday awaiting a possible US Supreme Court ruling on President Donald Trump’s global tariffs that were announced in April. Meanwhile, the cooler-than-expected US consumer price index reading reinforced bond traders’ expectations that the Fed will wait until mid-year to cut rates. Even after Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his board lowered the benchmark three times last year, money markets have continued to project the next reduction only in mid-2026. “The initial excitement sparked by a cooler-than-anticipated core CPI was short-lived,” said Jose Torres at Interactive Brokers. “The reversal was influenced, in part, by the report’s failure to pull forward the next expected rate reduction from June to April, as fixed-income watchers project Powell’s December cut will be his last at the helm.” Following JPMorgan’s results Tuesday, earnings from megabank rivals Bank of America Corp., Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley are slated for Wednesday and Thursday. The group is expected to post its second-highest annual profit ever, boosted by Trump’s policy changes. Traders also are mindful of the potential for a US Supreme Court ruling Wednesday on tariffs the White House has been enforcing. An adverse ruling could draw a negative market reaction, even as the administration has alternative legal avenues for most of the levies. Elsewhere, Brent crude notched its biggest four-day gain since June as Trump ramped up rhetoric on Iran, while silver also extended its recent rally to cap its best three-day streak on record. Attention in Asia will once again be on Japan, where Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s reported plan for a snap election fueled a rally in stocks while pushing down bonds and driving the yen deeper into the intervention-risk zone. Japanese five-year yields rose to 1.615%, the highest since the tenor’s 2000 debut. Success at the polls for Takaichi, who ascended to the premiership in October, would provide a mandate for her to continue hawkish diplomacy and pro-stimulus policies. Back to the US inflation data, the December core CPI, excluding the often volatile food and energy categories, increased 0.2% from November. On an annual basis, it advanced 2.6%, matching a four-year low. The reading is perhaps a more convincing sign that inflation is on a downward path, since a number of caveats in November’s report contributed to a significant pullback in the annual core CPI. “Given the quirks of November’s dual-month report, it’s surprising not to see more numerous large month-over-month readjustments,” said Stephen Kates at Bankrate. “Consumers can breathe a sigh of relief that we didn’t snap back to the 3% annual inflation rate. Although today’s reading doesn’t demonstrate additional progress for inflation, it doesn’t take a step backwards either.”"
"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade TVS Motor, Union Bank of India, Dredging Corporation, Tech Mahindra, ICICI Bank, and others on January 14?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-tvs-motor-union-bank-of-india-dredging-corporation-tech-mahindra-icici-bank-and-others-on-january-14-13771690.html,"The benchmark indices gave up some of the previous day’s gains, with the Nifty 50 declining 0.22 percent on January 13. Market breadth was moderately weak, with about 1,491 shares declining against 1,370 advancing shares on the NSE. The market may see consolidation as long as it trades below the midline of the Bollinger Bands. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Amol Athawale, VP Technical Research at Kotak Securities TVS Motor Company | CMP: Rs 3,755.4 After declining from higher levels, TVS Motor rebounded from its retracement zone and witnessed a robust recovery. Additionally, on the intraday charts, the stock has given a breakout from its sloping trendline. The upward move in the stock suggests a new leg of a bullish trend from current levels. For the next few trading sessions, Rs 3,620 could be the trend-decider level for bulls. If the stock sustains above this level, a further uptrend towards Rs 4,010 can be expected. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 4,010 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,620 Jindal Steel | CMP: Rs 1,010.8 After a remarkable up move on the daily chart, Jindal Steel witnessed profit booking at higher levels. Following the recent sell-off, the downward momentum in the stock has stalled. Moreover, the stock has found support near its demand zone. This formation suggests a revival of the uptrend from current levels in the near future. For positional traders, Rs 980 would be the decisive level. If the stock trades above this level, the uptrend is likely to continue towards Rs 1,080. However, if it closes below Rs 980, traders may prefer to exit long positions. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,080 Stop-Loss: Rs 980 Union Bank of India | CMP: Rs 166.19 Following its strong up move and a brief consolidation over the last few sessions, Union Bank of India is gaining further traction for a fresh up move. The chart structure indicates a bullish continuation pattern, which is likely to persist in the near term. As long as the stock trades above Rs 161, the bullish bias is likely to continue, with an upside target of Rs 178. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 178 Stop-Loss: Rs 161 Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO at Waves Strategy Advisors Dredging Corporation of India | CMP: Rs 1,105 On the daily chart, Dredging Corporation of India has been trading in a broad consolidation range of Rs 892–1,071 over the past few weeks, indicating an accumulation phase. In the previous session, the stock finally gave a range breakout and managed to close above the range at Rs 1,105. This move was supported by a strong rise in volumes, adding credibility to the breakout. Additionally, the MACD has witnessed a bullish crossover for the first time since December 2025, which is a positive sign. For now, any dips towards Rs 1,070–1,075 can be considered a buying opportunity for an upside move towards Rs 1,150. On the downside, the Rs 1,020 level is expected to act as a crucial support. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,150 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,020 Tech Mahindra | CMP: 1,614.8 On the daily chart, Tech Mahindra has been moving within a larger triangle pattern since the beginning of December 2024 and is now trading close to the trendline resistance. At the start of this week, the stock found support at the 50-day EMA (Exponential Moving Average) and witnessed a sharp rebound, forming higher highs and higher lows, which signals an improving price structure. For now, a break above Rs 1,635 can confirm a breakout from the triangle pattern, potentially resulting in a fresh rally towards Rs 1,750–1,800, as long as the EMA support near Rs 1,558 remains protected on the downside. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,750, Rs 1,800 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,558 ICICI Bank | CMP: Rs 1,437 At the start of the month, ICICI Bank confirmed a breakout from a double-bottom pattern and has successfully retested the breakout zone. The stock is now trading near its prior swing high of Rs 1,442, indicating sustained strength. Over the past two sessions, prices have consistently protected the previous day’s low on a closing basis, which is a positive sign. Additionally, the Know Sure Thing (KST) indicator has already given a bullish crossover and is now trading above the zero line, suggesting that positive momentum is likely to continue. A decisive break above the Rs 1,442 level is required for bullish momentum to extend, which could push prices higher towards Rs 1,540, while Rs 1,390 is expected to act as the nearest support. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,540 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,390"

Zydus Lifesciences' unit Sentynl wins USFDA nod for rare pediatric disease therapy,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/zydus-lifesciences-unit-sentynl-wins-usfda-nod-for-rare-pediatric-menkes-disease-therapy-13771070.html,"Sentynl Therapeutics, a U.S.-based subsidiary of Zydus Lifesciences, has secured USFDA approval for ZYCUBO (copper histidinate), the first and only treatment for Menkes disease in the United States. The rare, fatal genetic disorder affects copper absorption and transport, leaving patients with severe neurological symptoms and a life expectancy of less than three years without treatment. The approval marks a milestone for Zydus Lifesciences, positioning the group in the rare disease space with a therapy that addresses a critical unmet need. “For the first time, patients have access to an approved therapy, offering hope where no options existed,” said Dr. Sharvil Patel, Managing Director of Zydus Lifesciences. ZYCUBO, a subcutaneous injectable formulation, restores copper homeostasis in pediatric patients. Clinical trials showed early treatment reduced the risk of death by nearly 80 percent compared to untreated controls, with median overall survival reaching 177 months versus 17.6 months for untreated patients. The USFDA granted ZYCUBO multiple designations, including breakthrough therapy, Fast Track, and Orphan Drug status. Sentynl acquired the asset from Cyprium Therapeutics in 2023 and advanced it through pivotal studies. The therapy also holds Orphan Designation in Europe. What is Menkes disease? Menkes disease, an X-linked recessive disorder caused by ATP7A gene mutations, has an estimated birth prevalence as high as 1 in 8,664 live male births. Untreated patients typically die by age three. ZYCUBO is not indicated for Occipital Horn Syndrome. The approval underscores Zydus Lifesciences’ push into innovation-led therapies beyond its generics base. The company employs 29,000 globally and aims to expand its rare disease portfolio through Sentynl’s U.S. platform."
'President Trump doesn’t impact my investing cycle': Raamdeo Agrawal explains why,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/president-trump-doesn-t-impact-my-investing-cycle-raamdeo-agrawal-explains-why-13771306.html,"As Donald Trump's incessant tariff flipflops continue to impact markets globally, ace market expert and Motilal Oswal Group Chairman Raamdeo Agrawal said that the US President's decisions don't impact his investments. While speaking at CNBC TV18 Market Forum event ""The Alpha Generators for 2026"", Agrawal acknowledged that Trump's decisions do have an impact on the world because the world has become very interdependent due to the multi-lateral globalisation. ""On one side Trump is happening, and on the other side, AI is happening. I don't know how to figure out which one will impact how much. So, I am very happy that I am in India. I do things that I understand, and you need to have a view on four-five things and find ideas out of it,"" he said. Entrepreneurs or magicians? On being asked if such macro uncertainties can pose a threat to valuation, Agrawal said equity is a very ""exotic"" asset class. ""Equity has a huge power to take in a lot of uncertainty, and yet, there are few entrepreneurs who can act like a magician and navigate all kinds of risks. We have to find them, who can navigate such hard times and deliver earnings,"" the market analyst added. Agrawal further said that AI may have reduced the terminal value of Indian IT sector from what it was five year back. However, the analyst took the example of Yoga to explain the fast adoption of AI in India. “Yoga was discovered in India. However, people in US and other countries practice it more than us now. Similarly, AI was established in US or China, but we are the fastest and biggest adopter of AI,” he said, adding that Indian IT services companies will deliver the highest number of AI agents. How will markets perform in 2026? After nearly muted returns in 2025, the market expert expects 2026 to see better performance from the markets as the earnings cycle is turning after a brief lull over the past four-five quarters. He noted that the government is also trying its best to support the economy through various measures, including GST rationalization. Agrawal sees GDP recovery over the next 12 months, which in turn will boost earnings and subsequently markets. Which sectors will outperform? ""Large caps have better chances to perform well in the markets, than midcaps and smallcaps. PSUs still have lot of steam. They are much more reasonably valued than the private sector, and earnings growth is almost 2x higher than the private sector,"" the analyst said. He was also very optimistic about the auto sector, and said investors should buy auto ETFs. Also read: Will markets see a pre-Budget rally? Don't expect broad-based buying, say analysts"
"Budget 2026: Will markets see a pre-Budget rally? Don't expect broad-based buying, say analysts",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/budget-2026-will-markets-see-pre-budget-rally-don-t-expect-broad-based-buying-say-analysts-13771172.html,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will be presenting Union Budget 2026 on February 1. Investors are looking forward to a rally ahead of the Budget presentation, though markets remain in red at present. Sensex dropped more than 250 points (0.3 percent) to close at 83,627.69 on January 13. Nifty 50 fell around 58 points (0.22 percent) to end the session at 25,732.30. How did markets react ahead of the previous Budget? Markets remained more or less flat with no major surprises ahead of Budget 2025. After closing 2024 at 23,644.80, Nifty 50 hit the month's high at 23,689.50 on January 9, 2025, marking only a marginal increase from December 31, 2024 closing level. Overall, the index ended January 2025 with slight losses before Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented Union Budget 2025 on February 1. Sensex too more or less mirrored Nifty’s performance during the month, falling 0.8 percent in January 2025 before the Budget presentation. ""Historical trends indicate that the Indian market typically underperforms in January preceding a budget, with the Nifty falling in four of the last five years due to profit-booking and policy uncertainty. Current indicators reinforce this cautious outlook,” said Santosh Meena, Head of Research at Swastika Investmart. Will markets rally ahead of Budget 2026? The pre-Budget periods are characterised by higher levels of market volatility and not the usual straight-line move to the higher side, as the market tries to price in its views on fiscal spending, said Siddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director, Vibhavangal Anukulakara. Swapnil Aggarwal, Director at VSRK Capital, also said that investors can expect some degree of pre-Budget positioning in the markets, though it is likely to be selective rather than a broad-based rally. However, Maurya said there could be bouts of buying in selected sectors, identified with the focus area of the Government, such as infrastructure, manufacturing, and consumption. He added that one cannot expect a broad-based move purely on expectation. ""The market shall have to await the Budget measures to ensure that concerns on growth are dealt with and fiscal discipline is seen,"" he concluded. Aggarwal meanwhile said that the sentiment typically improves on expectations of growth-supportive measures, especially around capital expenditure, infrastructure push, and incentives for emerging sectors as the Union Budget approaches. Cautious optimism: ""Recent market action suggests cautious optimism, with participants closely tracking macro signals, global cues, and fiscal discipline. While volatility may persist in the near term, incremental buying could emerge in pockets where policy continuity and earnings visibility are expected,"" the analyst said. That said, markets are unlikely to price in aggressive outcomes ahead of the Budget, and any upside may remain measured until there is clarity on actual announcements, Aggarwal said, adding that the near-term trend points towards consolidation with intermittent rallies, as investors balance Budget optimism with valuation concerns and global uncertainties. Which sectors will likely benefit? Ahead of the Union Budget 2026, the market focus is sharpening on sectors likely to benefit from a government push for economic growth, particularly through capital expenditure and rural revival, said Santosh Meena, Head of Research at Swastika Investmart. Infrastructire and defence: According to Meena, investors should look closely at infrastructure and defence, where expectations for sustained high allocation remain strong to support 'Make in India' initiatives. In the infrastructure space, companies like HG Infra Engineering and Larsen & Toubro (L&T) are top picks due to strong order books, while the defence sector offers opportunities in Bharat Electronics (BEL), Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL), and Mazagon Dock as they benefit from localization policies. Renewables and critical minerals: Additionally, renewables and critical minerals are gaining traction, with stocks like National Aluminium Company (NALCO), Tata Power and GMDC in focus due to the global shift toward green energy and energy security. Consumption and agriculture: The consumption and agriculture sectors are critical themes this year, driven by expectations of fiscal stimulus to address rural distress, Meena said. “The market anticipates measures such as enhanced subsidies or tax relief to boost disposable income, which would directly benefit the rural economy. Consequently, agricultural inputs are a key area to watch, with stocks like UPL, Dhanuka Agritech, Fertilisers And Chemicals Travancore (FACT) and Coromandel International positioned to gain from farm support schemes,” according to the analyst. This rural recovery narrative extends to broader consumption plays - FMCG giants like Hindustan Unilever (HUL) and ITC are defensive bets, while Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) serves as a strong proxy for both auto and rural demand. Banks: Financials, particularly State Bank of India (SBI) and HDFC Bank, remain foundational holdings to play the overall credit growth story, according to Meena. ""While a sharp, broad-based rally ahead of the Budget appears unlikely, selective upside cannot be ruled out in budget-sensitive sectors. Any pre-Budget rally is likely to be narrow, stock-specific and driven by expectations around capex, defence spending and rural support rather than a sustained market-wide move,"" the analyst concluded. Investors may thus see pockets of rally, particularly in sectors linked to capital expenditure, infrastructure, manufacturing, defence, and rural consumption, as traders position themselves ahead of favourable policy cues, said Karthik Narayan, Vice President – Title, Tax & Transition, Stellar Innovations. However, a broad-based and sustained rally will depend upon how far the Budget can balance growth stimulus with fiscal discipline, the analyst said. What should investors do? Narender Agarwal, Founder & CEO at Wealth1, also noted that any rally ahead of the Budget is likely to be measured rather than euphoric, and investors should avoid aggressive positioning purely on expectations, focusing instead on fundamentally strong businesses. “For investors, the Budget should be seen as an opportunity to align portfolios with India’s long-term growth themes rather than focus solely on short-term volatility. A growth-oriented Budget, backed by strong economic momentum, can support broader market participation and set the stage for sustained returns beyond the Budget event,” said Tushar Badjate, Director of Badjate Stock & Shares."
"Taking Stock: Nifty below 25,750, Sensex down 250 pts; pharma, realty down, PSU Banks gain",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/taking-stock-nifty-below-25-750-sensex-down-250-pts-pharma-realty-down-psu-banks-gain-13770713.html,"In another volatile session, the Indian equity market ended lower on January 13, with the Nifty slipping below 25,750 amid selling pressure in auto, consumer durables, pharma and realty stocks. Amid positive global cues, domestic indices opened on a strong note, extending the previous session’s sharp recovery. However, the benchmarks failed to sustain early gains and remained largely rangebound through the day, eventually closing with modest losses. At close, the Sensex was down 250.48 points or 0.30 percent at 83,627.69, and the Nifty was down 57.95 points or 0.22 percent at 25,732.30.

Click to View More Outlook for January 14 Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets remained volatile on the weekly expiry day and ended marginally lower amid mixed cues. After an initial uptick, the Nifty 50 drifted lower for most of the session, though a rebound in the final hour trimmed some losses and helped it settle at 25,732.30. Sectoral trends were mixed, keeping participants engaged, with IT and metal stocks among the gainers, while realty and pharma remained subdued and closed in the red. The midcap and smallcap segments witnessed selective participation, with smallcaps showing modest resilience even as overall market breadth stayed moderate. Market action reflects the interplay between earnings-related reactions and global uncertainty. Early optimism was supported by encouraging IT earnings and signs of progress in India–U.S. trade discussions, which lifted sentiment in the first half. However, the lack of follow-through and fresh selling in heavyweights across sectors capped the upside. Ongoing geopolitical and global trade concerns also continued to weigh on risk appetite, keeping trading largely stock-specific. We maintain a cautious view on the Nifty and suggest continuing with a sell-on-rise approach until the index decisively reclaims the 26,000 level. A decisive breach of medium-term 100-day EMA, placed near 25,600, could accelerate the decline toward the 25,400 zone. Given the earnings season and fluctuating global cues, it is prudent to stay light and wait for clearer confirmation of the next directional move. Participants should focus on stock-specific opportunities and prefer a hedged approach amid the prevailing choppiness. Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities After witnessing an excellent upside recovery from the lows on Monday, Nifty slipped into weakness from the highs on Tuesday and closed the day's lower amidst recovery note. After opening on an upside gap, Nifty failed to sustain the highs and slipped into weakness in the early-mid part of the session. Smart recovery has emerged from near the lows of 25600 and Nifty finally closed off the lows. The opening upside gap has been filled completely. A long bear candle was formed on the daily chart with long lower shadow. Technically, this market action indicates presence of crucial overhead resistance around 25900-26000 levels. But the buying has started to emerge from near the lower supports. This is positive signal and hints at the possibility of eventual breakout in the short term. The underlying short-term trend of Nifty remains positive. The formation of higher bottom reversal pattern on intraday chart (60 min) indicates that the market could move up from here and surpass the hurdle of 25900-26000 levels in the next few sessions. Immediate support is placed at 25600 levels. Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Citi called the development a ""marginal negative"" for Cipla. The shares of the pharma major dropped to a nine-month low of Rs 1,436.60 apiece, before recovering some losses to close at Rs 1,448 apiece. US FDA approves Lannett's generic Advair inhaler version: Respirent Pharmaceuticals and Lannett have received final approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a generic version of Advair Diskus, which is a key respiratory drug used to treat patients suffering from asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Notably, Aurobindo Pharma in July last year had announced the acquisition of Lannett for $250 million. Citi Research said that the generic version will likely add $30 million to $40 million to the company's annual US revenues. Cipla has been awaiting FDA's approval for its own generic version of Advair. While noting that FDA's approval to Lannett was a ""marginal negative"" for Cipla, the international firm sees the pharma major getting the approval in near-term.

It has revised the tag-line from ""10,000+ products delivered in 10 minutes"" to ""30,000+ products delivered at your doorstep"". This comes after Union Labour Minister Mansukh Mandaviya held meetings over the past month with major quick commerce and delivery platforms, including Blinkit, Zepto, Zomato and Swiggy, to discontinue the marketing and branding of 10-minute delivery services. Other quick commerce platforms, such as Swiggy and Zepto, may also follow suit after the intervention by the Union Ministry of Labour, which was concerned about the welfare of the delivery workers trying to meet such tight deadlines. The promise of 10-minute delivery led to gig workers holding a nationwide strike on New Year's Eve in 2025, drawing attention to workers' health, safety and income.

"Ixigo shares jump 9% on JM Financial's double upgrade, says correction is 'overdone'",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/ixigo-shares-jump-9-on-jm-financial-s-double-upgrade-says-correction-is-overdone-13770625.html,"The shares of Ixigo-parent Le Travenues Technology jumped more than 9 percent on January 13 after JM Financial upgraded its rating on the stock to 'Buy' from 'Reduce', citing multiples reasons. The shares of the company rose to Rs 232.55 apiece, snapping a four-session losing streak. JM Financial on Ixigo: JM Financial noted that Ixigo shares have corrected approximately 20 percent since the end of November 2025 due to expectation of relatively slower growth in the flights business in Q3 and Q4 FY26 after recent disruptions in the industry and an unfavourable base (Kumbh Mela benefit last year), and uncertainty around margin due to ramp-up in its tech, supply-side and promotional investments towards hotels’ OTA. However, the domestic brokerage believes that the current phase represents a temporary earnings and sentiment overhang, which shall ease over the next few quarters. “From a medium-to-long-term perspective, Ixigo remains well positioned to grow faster than peers owing to its effective cross-sell of services across various apps, sharp focus on superior customer experience and robust traction for its differentiated value-added services,” it added. JM Financial however lowered its target price for the stock to Rs 275 per share from Rs 300 per share, based on a cut in FY26–28E earnings by 4–8 percent and target P/E to 60x (from 65x). The latest target price implies an upside potential of more than 29 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. The domestic brokerage noted that the recent correction has materially improved the risk-reward, prompting the double upgrade.

The brokerage played down investor concerns around deposit growth and the elevated loan-to-deposit ratio. HDFC Bank stock was last seen at Rs 936.5 in afternoon trade, little changed on the day, after touching an intraday high of Rs 947.7 in the morning, when it was up about 1.1 percent. The stock remains up around 15 percent over the past year, outperforming the Nifty 50’s roughly 11 percent gain over the same period. Broader market was trading weak on Tuesday, with benchmark indices BSE Sensex and Nifty 50 shedding about 0.5 percent each, amid a volatile session. Banking index Bank Nifty lost 0.1 percent in the afternoon after staying in green through the day. In a note, CLSA reiterated its ‘Outperform’ rating on HDFC Bank with a target price of Rs 1,200 per share. The brokerage noted that the stock has corrected 6-7 percent since the Q3 FY26 operational update. It described that this correction comes amid a growing frustration among investors over moderating deposit growth and a rise in the loan-to-deposit ratio to about 99 percent. Also read | Cash segment margin likely to reduce, SEBI panel endorses margin rationalisation proposal However, CLSA argued that most of these concerns are either misconceived or temporary.

The brokerage also highlighted valuation comfort, noting that after the recent correction, HDFC Bank is trading at a 10-12 percent price-to-book discount to ICICI Bank, and said it is an opportunity for investors to look past near-term noise and focus on the franchise’s longer-term strengths. HDFC Bank, India’s largest private sector lender by market capitalisation at about Rs 14.4 lakh crore, is currently valued at around 19.9 times earnings, with a dividend yield of roughly 1.18 percent.

Will Trump's 25% tariff on countries doing business with Iran be a negative for Indian markets? Here's what analysts say,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/will-trump-s-25-tariff-on-countries-doing-business-with-iran-be-a-negative-for-indian-markets-here-s-what-analysts-say-13770512.html,"US President Donald Trump has announced that any country engaging in business with Iran will face 25 percent tariff on any trade with US. Analysts have suggested what this can mean for Indian stock markets. Indian benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty have seen some pressure last year amid Trump’s tariff flipflops. The almost muted annual returns in 2025 came as Trump increased tariffs on Indian exports to US to 50 percent, citing New Delhi’s continued purchase of Russian oil. Amid Iran's biggest anti-government protests in years, Trump took to Truth Social to announce his new round of tariffs. ""Effective immediately, any Country doing business with the Islamic Republic of Iran will pay a Tariff of 25% on any and all business being done with the United States of America,"" he wrote. ""This Order is final and conclusive,"" Trump said without providing any further detail. No official documentation from the White House on the new round of tariffs has yet been released. Iran, a member of the OPEC oil producing group, has been heavily sanctioned by Washington for years. It exports much of its oil to China, with Turkey, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates and India among its other top trading partners. Sensex dropped more than 545 points (0.65 percent) to 83,328, while Nifty 50 fell 157 points (0.61 percent) to 25,632.90, as seen at 1 pm on Tuesday. Fresh pressure on India? Trump’s decision to impose a 25 percent tariff on countries trading with Iran adds fresh pressure on India, which is already facing tariffs of up to 50 percent on several exports to the US. Together, this creates a potential tariff burden of as much as 75 percent on certain Indian goods. India–Iran trade stood at $1.68 billion in FY25, and mainly comprised exports of rice, food products, medicines, tea, and spices to Iran, while imports include chemicals and dry fruits, said Abhinav Tiwari, Research Analyst at Bonanza. He noted that while the trade size is modest, the concern is that the US tariff applies broadly to countries doing business with Iran, not just to Iran related goods. “A key strategic risk is the Chabahar Port project in Iran, which is vital for India’s access to Central Asia. While the project currently has a US sanctions waiver valid until April 2026, there is uncertainty over whether it will remain protected,” the analyst further said. 'A key macro overhang for Indian markets, but...' The renewed threat of a 25 percent tariff by former US President Donald Trump has resurfaced as a key macro overhang for Indian markets, but its actual economic impact needs to be viewed with perspective rather than panic, said Harshal Dasani, Business Head at INVasset PMS. He noted that while headlines suggest a broad-based disruption, India's direct export exposure to the US remains concentrated in select segments such as textiles, gems and jewellery, leather goods and certain engineering products. Impact on Rupee? A potential 25 percent tariff threat on exports to the US is already being felt as it adds to trade tensions, which affect rupee weakness, especially in sectors that are more sensitive to exports, said Siddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director at Vibhavangal Anukulakara. “Although the Indian economy is more domestically oriented, stock markets related to exports can suffer short-term turbulence in stock markets due to the potential growth impact from tariffs. Investors will watch to what level of diversification can happen to avoid the negative impact due to tariffs,” he said. “For markets, the immediate reaction has been driven more by sentiment than fundamentals. Export-linked stocks may witness near-term volatility, but India’s broader market construct today is far more domestically anchored than in previous tariff cycles. Consumption, financials, infrastructure and services continue to be driven by internal demand rather than US trade flows,” Dasani said, adding that this phase will let investors distinguish headline risk from earnings reality. In the near term, the impact should be manageable due to low Iran trade exposure and ongoing India–US negotiations, and over the medium term, a negotiated settlement remains the most likely outcome, which would limit market damage and reduce long term risks, said Tiwari from Bonanza.

"Jefferies says new labour codes may add to margin pressures for IT companies, sees lower wage hikes at senior level",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/jefferies-says-new-labour-codes-may-add-to-margin-pressures-for-it-companies-sees-lower-wage-hikes-at-senior-level-13770233.html,"Global brokerage firm Jefferies on Monday said India’s new labour codes are likely to add to margin pressures for information technology (IT) firms and could lead to lower wage hikes, particularly at the senior level. The labour codes, which came into effect in November, mandate that employee wages must be at least 50 percent of cost to company (CTC), with benefits such as provident fund and gratuity to be calculated on wages. This is expected to raise recurring employee costs for IT companies and also result in a large one-time financial impact. ""New labour codes will add to the margin pressures from slower revenue growth, AI-led business mix change and potentially higher onsite wage hikes in FY27 and FY28 due to changes in H-1B visa norms,"" Jefferies said in a note. It added that a 2 percent increase in Indian employee costs could reduce FY27 earnings estimates by 2-4 percent for IT companies. Firms are likely to offset part of the impact through lower wage hikes, especially at senior levels. IT services firm HCLTech reported an 11.2 percent decline in consolidated net profit to Rs 4,076 crore for the October-December quarter of FY26, mainly due to a one-time provision of Rs 719 crore linked to the implementation of the new labour codes. The Noida-based company had posted a net profit of Rs 4,591 crore in the same quarter last year. Excluding the one-time impact, HCLTech said net profit would have stood at Rs 4,795 crore. Regulatory filings showed that the impact on earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) was Rs 956 crore. HCLTech said the one-time impact under the labour code amounted to about Rs 900 crore, and that this would not affect its hiring plans. Chief People Officer Ram Sundararajan said the company has factored in all required provisions in the current quarter’s pay changes and does not expect any further significant incremental costs related to the new rules. Country’s largest IT services exporter Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) also reported a 13.91 percent decline in profit for the December quarter at Rs 10,657 crore, largely due to the one-time impact of the labour codes. The company said the implementation of the new labour codes during the quarter led to a statutory impact of Rs 2,128 crore. Excluding this, profit would have grown 8.5 percent to Rs 13,438 crore.

"Auto stocks decline for fifth straight session: Analysts say overall outlook is positive, cite multiple tailwinds",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/auto-stocks-decline-for-fifth-straight-session-analysts-say-overall-outlook-is-positive-cite-multiple-tailwinds-13770407.html,"The shares of automakers and auto-parts makers dropped in trade on January 13, extending losses for the fifth consecutive session. Analysts have however expressed optimism, and what investment strategy investors should take after the consolidation. The fall in the share prices pushed the Nifty Auto index down around 0.7 percent to 27,817, as seen at 12.15 pm on Tuesday. The index has fallen more than 3 percent in the past five days. Top auto losers today: Tube Investments of India shares were the top loser on the index, falling around 2 percent to trade at Rs 2,367 apiece. Exide Industries, Uno Minda, Maruti Suzuki, Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) and TVS Motor Company shares meanwhile fell more than 1 percent each. Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles and Hero MotoCorp shares fell nearly 1 percent each, while Ashok Leyland and Eicher Motors shares were trading in the red with marginal losses. Bucking the trend, Sona BLW Precision Forgings, Bosch, Bajaj Auto, Bharat Forge and Samvardhana Motherson International shares were trading in the green with marginal gains. Here's what analysts say: The recent fall in the auto stocks reflects near-term profit booking and demand concerns, rather than a structural breakdown of the sector, said Siddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director at Vibhavangal Anukulakara. Harshal Dasani, Business Head at INVasset PMS, also said that the recent correction in Nifty Auto should be viewed more as a phase of consolidation than a breakdown in the sector’s fundamentals. ""Auto stocks have delivered strong returns over the last year, and some near-term profit booking was inevitable, especially amid broader market volatility. Importantly, the medium-term outlook for the auto sector remains constructive, supported by multiple policy and demand tailwinds,"" he said. From the March 2025 low of 19,300, the Nifty Auto index has rallied nearly 40 percent to 27,555, indicating that a lot of optimism is already priced in, said Tushar Badjate, Director of Badjate Stock & Shares. He noted that the recent correction reflects valuation rationalisation rather than demand stress. What lies ahead? Going forward, a rebound in demand indicators, stability in macros, and clarity in policies might help the auto names stabilize, Maurya said. However, he cautioned that till the time clear triggers on consumer demand or sector-specific catalysts emerge, volatility and range-bound action are likely to persist in the near term. Dasani noted that the potential GST rationalisation on automobiles, expectations of interest rate cuts, and income tax relief aimed at boosting disposable income can meaningfully support vehicle demand across segments. Lower financing costs tend to have a direct and visible impact on auto sales, particularly in passenger vehicles and two-wheelers. In addition, government focus on manufacturing, EV adoption, and infrastructure continues to support long-term volume growth, the analyst said. Will Trump's 500% tariff threat impact auto stocks? Concerns around the proposed 500 percent US tariff should not materially alter the outlook for Indian auto manufacturers, as India’s direct auto exports to the US are limited, Dasani highlighted. The impact, if any, is more likely to be felt by select auto ancillary players supplying components to global OEMs, rather than domestic auto makers themselves. Is this correction a buying opportunity? ""Overall, the recent correction offers an opportunity to recalibrate positions in a sector where structural drivers remain firmly intact and visibility on demand recovery continues to improve,"" Dasani concluded. Badjate said that going ahead, growth is likely to be more selective—led by OEMs with strong product pipelines, export visibility and rising EV penetration, which is gradually emerging as a structural growth driver for the sector. ""While near-term volatility may persist amid the ongoing Q3 earnings season, the broader structural outlook for the sector remains intact. The current correction could offer a buying opportunity for long-term investors, supported by healthy fundamentals and the Government’s continued focus on incentives for electric vehicles and hybrid mobility. Investors should maintain a selective approach, with a preference for sector leaders that have strong EV exposure,"" said Vishnu Kant Upadhyay, AVP -Research & Advisory at Master Capital Services. Ajit Mishra, SVP of Research at Religare Broking, said that with the earnings season underway, volatility is likely to persist, driven by stock-specific results. ""While most stocks in the sector are participating in the move, Bajaj Auto, Eicher Motors, TVS Motor, M&M, and Maruti are displaying relative strength and can be considered for accumulation on declines,"" he said.

"TCS, HCL Tech shares swing into green by noon after early losses, as investors factor in Q3 results weakness",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/tcs-hcl-tech-shares-swing-into-green-by-noon-after-early-losses-as-investors-factor-in-q3-results-weakness-13770306.html,"Shares of Tata Consultancy Services and HCL Technologies recovered from early losses to trade modestly higher by noon on Tuesday, as investors reassessed Q3 FY26 earnings and absorbed the initial wave of cautious brokerage commentary. The recovery in the IT majors' shares also followed a reversal in broader markets, with BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty erasing morning losses to edge into the green. TCS stock was trading at Rs 3,258.1 around noon, up 0.6 percent, reversing losses seen in early trade amid concerns around limited growth visibility. The recovery followed a firm 1.1 percent rise in the previous session ahead of the earnings announcement -- this suggests that some investors may have used early weakness to selectively add positions. Also read | TCS stock outlook cautious after Q3 results; brokerages flag weak growth visibility HCL Technologies shares also clawed back losses to trade 0.15 percent higher at Rs 1,670.1 by midday. The stock had fallen more than 2 percent in the morning trade after its Q3 results, despite a strong operational performance and a guidance upgrade, as brokerages flagged constraints on near-term upside. The intraday rebound in both stocks points to stabilising sentiment after initial post-results selling. In both cases, analysts broadly acknowledged steady execution, healthy deal pipelines, and resilient margins. However, enthusiasm remained tempered by broader concerns around growth sustainability and near-term earnings momentum. Also read | HCL Tech Q3 results review: Fundamentals improve, but brokerages cautious on near-term stock outlook For TCS, brokerages highlighted muted international business trends, modest forward indicators, and limited clarity on a sharp growth acceleration, keeping most houses in neutral or cautious territory despite operational stability. For HCL Tech, analysts pointed to seasonality risks -- especially in the products business -- along with valuation comfort and historical post-results performance patterns as factors restraining near-term optimism. Despite the midday recovery, both stocks remain under pressure on a longer-term basis. TCS is still down over 24 percent over the past year, while HCL Tech has fallen more than 16 percent over the same period. The investor focus remains firmly on whether deal execution, demand momentum, and AI-led initiatives can translate into a more durable growth recovery.

"Capital One, Amex shares sink on Trump's credit-card threat",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/capital-one-amex-shares-sink-on-trump-s-credit-card-threat-13770303.html,"Shares of Capital One Financial Corp., American Express Co. and other US banks sank after President Donald Trump called on credit-card companies to cap interest rates at 10% for a year, a move that could wipe out billions in profits for one of the banking industry’s biggest businesses. Capital One, the largest US card issuer, tumbled 6.4% in New York, the biggest decline in nine months, after the president surprised the industry with a move he said could go into effect next week. American Express dropped 4.3% and JPMorgan Chase & Co., No. 2 in the card rankings, slid 1.4%. Card interest rates, which have been hovering above 20% in recent years, have been a target of US lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, with bills popping up proposing similar caps and meeting stiff resistance from the industry. Trump, speaking Sunday to reporters, set a Jan. 20 deadline for companies to comply or risk being “in violation of the law.” The cap proposed by the president “could wipe out earnings from cards for a year,” Mike Mayo, an analyst at Wells Fargo & Co., said in a note. The idea “would ruin card economics (eliminate most of card earnings today) and incentives would be to stop lending,” Mayo said. Citigroup Inc. dropped 3%, while Wells Fargo slipped 1% and Synchrony Financial lost 8.4% on Monday. Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. also fell. While those companies aren’t issuers of credit cards, they rely on fees generated when consumers use their products. Despite the political appeal of Trump’s proposal, several analysts questioned whether approval of a rate cap was likely, given the strength of the banking industry’s pull in Congress and limited legislative momentum. “Given how severe it is, it is hard to imagine it moving forward,” Brian Foran, an analyst at Truist Financial Corp., wrote in a note. In response to Trump’s call, industry groups including the Bank Policy Institute and Consumer Bankers Association struck a measured tone. “We share the president’s goal of helping Americans access more affordable credit,” the groups said in a joint statement late Friday. “At the same time, evidence shows that a 10% interest rate cap would reduce credit availability and be devastating for millions of American families and small-business owners who rely on and value their credit cards, the very consumers this proposal intends to help.” Should the idea take effect, fallout would probably affect lower-income consumers the most as banks restrict their access to loans, according to several analysts. “As credit availability is curtailed, consumers will have to rely on alternate sources of consumer lending,” KBW Inc. analyst Sanjay Sakhrani wrote in a note, adding that those alternatives are “significantly more expensive” for borrowers. Barclays Plc, the British lender that relies on credit cards as a key part of its US consumer banking business, slumped 2.4% in London, the firm’s biggest loss since Nov. 18. What Bloomberg Intelligence Says: Any US cap or restriction on credit card rates would hit Barclays hardest among European banks. The lender’s US consumer bank is expected to generate £3.6 billion revenue in 2025 (12% of group total), but 5% of pretax profit, with credit cards a key element. Though President Donald Trump’s demand that credit card interest rates are capped at 10% might not be enforced in full given the strength of US bank lobby groups. — Phil Richards, BI banking analyst There could be a few winners as well. Wells Fargo’s Mayo said that if general availability of traditional credit card loans is reduced due to rate caps, the attractiveness of buy-now, pay-later firms such as Klarna Group Plc and Affirm Holdings Inc. could increase. Shares of Klarna fell 2.7% and Affirm lost 6.6%. Airlines, which generate substantial profits from credit-card partnerships, also took a hit on Monday. Delta Air Lines Inc. shares fell 1.8%, United Airlines Holdings Inc. dropped 1.7% and Southwest Airlines Co. slipped 1.5%. Retailers with substantive credit-card portfolios also took a hit. Macy’s Inc. fell 5.4% on Monday and Kohl’s Corp. shares were down 3.9%. Follow all LIVE updates from the stock markets here."

It has a diversified product mix, with ULIP/NonPar/Par/Protection contributing 50%/34%/8%/8% in 1HFY26. The business is primarily led by the bancassurance channel, with Canara Bank/HSBC contributing 70%/15% in 1HFY26.

Resultantly, its market share has increased by 90bp/110bp during the period within the industry/private segment. We believe the industry is well positioned to deliver strong growth traction, aided by 1) increasing penetration (India’s penetration at 2.8% vs. global 2.9%), 2) GST exemption tailwind, 3) narrowing protection gap in the country (83% in India, highest among peers), and 4) expected favorable regulations such as riskbased solvency, composite license etc. Outlook We value the company at 1.7x FY28E P/EV to arrive at a TP of INR180.

The VSF business is entering a margin recovery phase in 2HFY26, supported by a modest rebound in China pricing, stable pulp costs, and consistently high utilization levels (>90%). These should drive an expansion in EBITDA/kg and margins over FY27–28E. In chemicals, GRASIM’s leadership in chlor-alkali and epoxy resins, coupled with ongoing investments to raise chlorine integration to ~70%, underpins steady revenue and EBITDA growth despite a correction in caustic soda price due to overcapacity. Outlook The paints business (Birla Opus), while currently in an investment-led phase, provides a scalable growth optionality in a large and under-penetrated market, with rapid distribution expansion and brand investments positioning the business for medium-term operating leverage once scale is achieved.

The service business growth was majorly led by ER&D segment that reported another quarter of strong growth (+3.1% QoQ CC vs 2.2% QoQ CC LQ). The service-led growth was largely aided by extop 20 accounts (+2.3% QoQ), which implies the decision making and execution cycle remains strong at the lower-end of the pyramid.
