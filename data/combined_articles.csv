"Broader indices gain in second week, these smallcaps give double digit return",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/broader-indices-gain-in-second-week-these-smallcaps-give-double-digit-return-13544144.html,"The broader indices performed inline with main indices, posting strong gains in the second consecutive week post GST rationalizations, positive global markets, hopes of ease on US-India trade tension, and DII supports. For the week, Nifty50 added 373 points or 1.50 percent to end at 25,114, while the BSE Sensex index added 1193.94 points or 1.47 percent to end at 81,904.70. BSE Largecap, Midcap and Smallcap indices rose 1.5 percent each. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) extended their selling in the 11th straight week, as they offload equities worth Rs 3,577.37 crore. On the other hand, Domestic Institutional Investors (DII) continued their buying in 22nd week, as they purchased equities worth Rs 13,703.23crore. Among sectors, except Nifty Consumer Durables (down 1 percent), all other indices ended in the green with Nifty Defence index rose 7 percent, Nifty IT index jumped over 4 percent, Nifty PSU Bank index added 3 percent, while Nifty Auto, Metal, Pharma jumped 2 percent each. ""Indian markets ended the week on a strong footing, with the Nifty closing above the 25,000 level and broader indices outperforming the benchmark. The upturn was supported by optimism over the anticipation of stronger H2FY26 earnings, driven by GST rationalisation and the benefits of monetary easing, which also provide resilience to valuations. Sentiment was further lifted by reports that the EU may reject U.S. tariff proposals on India’s Russian oil imports,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments. ""Continued foreign outflows weighed on the rupee, while gold reached fresh highs on strong safe-haven demand amid global trade tensions. The market, however, found support in improving prospects for India–US trade negotiations, suggesting tariff-related risks may prove short-lived. Although global bond yields have risen to new peaks, investors currently do not view them as a major threat."" ""The IT index exhibited its rally, driven by renewed hopes of a Fed rate cut, Infosys’ buyback announcement, and optimism over a revival in technology spending. Consumer-centric sectors, particularly Auto, displayed steady resilience, supported by expectations of GST-driven demand recovery and festive season tailwinds. Domestic CPI inflation registered a slight uptick; however, ongoing tax reforms are expected to help ease pressures in the period ahead,"" he added The BSE Small-cap index rose 1.5 percent with Sigachi Industries, Faze Three, Precision Camshafts, SMS Pharmaceuticals, Themis Medicare, Indo Count Industries, MTAR Technologies, IOL Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals, Prime Focus, New Delhi Television, India Tourism Development Corporation, Swelect Energy Systems, Greenpanel Industries, Dilip Buildcon, Garware Hi-Tech Films, JBM Auto, Ramco Industries, Salasar Techno Engineering rising 15-36 percent. On the other hand, KR Rail Enginerring, Paradeep Phosphates, Good Luck India, Reliance Infrastructure, Vimta Labs, Rishabh Instruments, CarTrade Tech fell between 10-16 percent. Where is Nifty50 headed? Osho Krishan, Sr. Analyst – Technical & Derivatives, Angel One On the levels front, the intermediate support level is anticipated to reside within the 25000-24900 range, which is expected to provide a buffer against potential declines. Furthermore, the positive crossover of the 20 and 50 DEMA around 24800 is regarded as a critical support zone from a positional perspective. At the higher end, intermediate resistance levels are identified around 25250, followed by a bearish gap located in the 25340 zone. Nevertheless, given the current technical configuration, the range of 25500 to 25600 appears to be attainable in the near term. Amol Athawale, VP Technical Research, Kotak Securities We believe that as long as the market is trading above 25,000/81800, the bullish sentiment is likely to continue. On the higher side, 25,150–25,200/82200-82400 would act as immediate resistance zones for the bulls. A successful breakout above 25,200/82400 could push the market up toward 25,500–25,550/83300-83500. On the flip side, below 25,000/81800, the uptrend could become vulnerable. Traders may consider exiting their long positions if the market falls below this level. For Bank Nifty, the 20-day SMA and the level of 54,300 could act as key support zones. Above these levels, the pullback move could continue toward 55,300–55,500 or the 50-day SMA. Conversely, if the index falls below 54,300, it could retest levels around 54,000–53,700. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities Nifty managed to stay in the green as put writers provided support around the 25,000 mark. The index appears to be consolidating its recent gains, gradually forming a base. As long as it sustains above 24,850, the undertone remains constructive. A decisive move beyond 25,150 may set the stage for a rally towards 25,500 in the near term. Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities The crucial hurdle of down sloping trend line and previous two weeks high has been surpassed quietly around 25000 mark and the market closed higher. Nifty closed above the weekly close of the last eight weeks at 25100 levels, which is signaling positive outlook for coming week. The underlying trend of Nifty continues to be positive. Having sustained above the key overhead resistance of 25000–25100 levels, Nifty is likely to move towards the next overhead resistance of 25350-25400 by next week. Immediate support is placed at 24900 levels. Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

India's leading miner has planned a capital expenditure of around Rs 2,000 crore over the next 5-6 years and will continue to add to the budget for exploration of copper ore reserves, the company said in an investor presentation, shared a day prior. Hindustan Copper's shares are sharply higher by over 10 percent with combined volumes that are 12x the one-month average on September 12, helped by a slew of factors including the ambitious expansion plan and capex details. The company reaffirmed its plans to acquire new copper deposits in India and abroad, including a collaboration with Chilean company CODELCO for capacity building and knowledge sharing. The company has MoU with PSUs such as RITES, IOC, Coal India and GAIL to expand its mining portfolio. The company is expanding the mining capacity at several locations including Malanjkhand Copper Project (MCP), Khetri Copper Complex (KCC), Indian Copper Complex (ICC), Kendadih and Rakha mines. Hindustan Copper, India’s sole miner of the mineral, is looking to boost its reserves and expand capacity at a time when global demand is rising. An increased budget of exploration had already led to 123 MT worth of additional reserves and resources in last two years, the miner said. Government's developmental initiatives such Make in India, PLI Schemes, EV push, Smart City Project, Aatmanirbhar in Defence, ambitious renewable energy target and other such initiatives are expected to further increase growth of copper consuming industries in India, the company has said. Another factor pushing up international copper prices is the suspension of operations at the Indonesia mine of Freeport-McMoRan, one of the major producers, following a mishap. Copper prices are also upbeat on hopes of a rate cut by the US Federal Reserve interest rate cut next week, which may boost economic activity, supporting copper demand."

"Market is held by price agnostic retail flows, will have to wait for 3-4 years if the mood changes: Manish Chokhani",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/market-is-held-by-price-agnostic-retail-flows-will-have-to-wait-3-4-years-if-the-mood-changes-manish-chokhani-13542312.html,"Market expert Manish Chokhani believes that the market is overall very optimistic, but it is held by ""price agnostic retail flows"" despite the exit of several foreign and PE investors. If the mood of the retail investors change even a bit, then markets may take another three-four years to return to similar optimism, he said while speaking to CNBC-TV18. ""As long as you are holding a stock with a time horizon of four-five years, and your return expectations are the normative 15 percent-type for this market, you will be okay,"" he said. ""But if you are thinking what we made over the last four years can continue, you will be in for disappointment,"" the Enam Holdings Director added during his conversation with the business news channel. Chokhani said India should identify the sectors that it intrinsically has a right to make. This includes Ayurveda and wellness, Indian design and fashion, and more. The market expert added that the souring trade relations between India and US was a surprise to everyone. ""In a larger context, India and US have been the two best performing markets, the two best democracies and the two best places for capitalism to thrive,"" he said, adding that the spat will likely be resolved. The market, which is being driven by the ""price agnostic retail flows"" shrugged off the tariff jitters, he said. Chokhani said US President Donald Trump's tariffs didn't include several sectors like pharma and electronics parts. Only textiles was one sector that could have been impacted. According to Chokhani, that too didn’t see a significant drop in share prices as investors assumed some conclusion to the trade worries will be reached in the next eight-nine months. ""The larger issue remains that India as an emerging third largest economy of the world is still not a player in global trade. We don’t seem to have the stuff that the world misses. We clearly need to step up our act to become a little more important in the world,"" he said. Chokhani expects Trump's tariffs on India to reduce to as much as 20 percent.

MC Explains: Can you invest in an IPO in GIFT City? Here's all you need to know about GIFT City IPOs,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/mc-explains-can-you-invest-in-an-ipo-in-gift-city-here-s-all-you-need-to-know-about-gift-city-ipos-13542289.html,"GIFT City, India’s first and only International Financial Services Centre (IFSC), is set to mark a milestone next month with the first-ever equity initial public offering (IPO). The debut issue by XED Executive Development Ltd., an executive education firm, will raise $12 million and list on NSE IFSC and India INX in mid-October. While modest in size, the deal carries outsized significance. It tests the International Financial Services Authority’s (IFSCA) Listing Regulations, 2024, which were designed to give India’s offshore hub a competitive playbook against Singapore or Dubai. Given the nature of GIFT City, an IPO in the special financial zone is unlike any public issue on BSE or NSE. The dynamics and the parameters are much different. Here's all you need to know about IPOs in GIFT City. How the process works Unlike domestic markets, companies listing in GIFT City need to meet just one of three thresholds — $20 million in revenue, $1 million in pre-tax profit, or a $25 million post-issue market capitalisation. Offer documents are required, but issues under $50 million enjoy a lighter-touch filing regime. An IFSCA official explained that “the framework is meant to encourage startups and mid-sized companies without diluting investor safeguards. Disclosures are IFRS-aligned, pricing can be fixed or book-built, and a 10 percent float is sufficient compared with 25 percent in the domestic market.” Promoter shares face a 180-day lock-up, while anchor investors get a 90-day lock. Investor incentives The rulebook is paired with a suite of tax breaks. Issuers enjoy a 10-year income tax holiday and no STT, CTT, GST or stamp duty. For investors, non-residents are exempt from capital gains tax, and debt investments carry a concessional 9 percent withholding tax. “Structurally, the idea is to make GIFT City attractive for foreign capital that might otherwise list in Singapore or Nasdaq,” said a market participant familiar with the policy intent. Further, trading hours extend up to 22 hours a day, opening access to global flows. However, direct participation by Indian retail investors is barred, except via mutual funds or through the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS). Opportunities and limits For issuers, the promise lies in tapping foreign portfolio investors, NRIs and global institutions without leaving Indian jurisdiction. For India’s policymakers, successful listings would showcase GIFT City as more than a derivatives and debt hub. But hurdles remain. Liquidity in GIFT City's equity market is thin, and the pool of investors is still narrow. “Unless larger companies come forward, the market risks being symbolic rather than substantive,” cautioned a person tracking the development. The XED test case XED’s $12 million raise may be small, but it offers a live experiment. With 95 percent of revenue from India and Singapore, and partnerships with Cornell and other global universities, the firm is targeting a 10 percent float under the new regime. Analysts say the implied valuation of 2-3x sales is moderate compared with mainboard edtech peers. The risk is that limited retail access and edtech’s shifting fortunes could dampen subscription. On the flip side, being the first mover could give XED a “halo effect” that later issuers may build on. Why it matters If XED lists smoothly, it may embolden more startups and mid-sized companies to consider GIFT City as a stepping stone before a larger domestic or overseas float. Policymakers see it as a way to position India’s own international centre in the capital-market map, instead of letting high-growth firms head straight to Nasdaq or SGX. As one official summed it up: “The IPO is less about XED itself, and more about proving that GIFT City can host equity capital formation. That credibility is what we are really testing.”"

Hold JSW Steel; target of Rs 1064: Prabhudas Lilladher,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/hold-jsw-steel-target-of-rs-1064-prabhudas-lilladher-13542279.html,"Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on JSW Steel We recently met the management of JSW Steel to gain insights into domestic steel demand and the company’s initiatives to improve margins. Newly commissioned 5mtpa at JVML has been ramping up well over the last few months. Brownfield Phase III 5mtpa expansion at Dolvi is on track to be commissioned by Sep’27, while in the near term, BF#3 at Vijayanagar is expected to undergo planned 6-month shutdown to upgrade capacity by 1.5mtpa by end of FY26. With another 0.5mtpa debottlenecking, JSTL would reach 36.4mtpa by FY26E. We expect JSTL to continue to capture market share as domestic demand improves aided by GST rationalization. JSTL remains India’s fastest growing steel producer with its superior execution capabilities. Over the last 5 years, its VASP volumes improved from 7.2mt to 15.4mt while its India crude steel capacity grew at 14% CAGR to 34.2mtpa – highest amongst peers. Outlook We expect JSTL to deliver strong 26% EBITDA CAGR over FY25-28E on a low base. At CMP, the stock is trading at 8x/7.4x EV on FY27/28E EBITDA. We maintain ‘HOLD’ rating with revised TP of Rs1,064 (Rs1,068 earlier), valuing the company at 7.5x EV/Sep’27E EBITDA (rolling forward from Mar’27).

While the footprint remains small compared to incumbents’ – ~100 dark stores versus 1,544 for Blinkit and 1,062 for Swiggy, Amazon has the capital as well as the ambition to scale it up. However, we believe that incumbents are better placed – creating almost an entirely new supply chain for its QCom business will be a challenge for Amazon, given that incumbents have an advantage of being top-of-the mind recall apps for a large pool of customers. More competition is a feature of the land grab phase, in which adjacent players enter the market which drives market expansion and growth. While excessive competition will weigh on profitability, we expect consumer stickiness to help incumbents retain customers. Outlook Once industry growth slows down, we expect a consolidation phase to follow, which will result in sub-scale players folding operations and driving profitability. Blinkit is executing well in the QCom space. We retain BUY on Eternal with a target price of Rs330.

Overall, the mgmt has a well-thought-out and credit-cycle-tested business strategy and resources to deliver profitable growth with lower volatility and higher predictability.

Given the GST reduction and improving outlook on value-format Walkway, we build in better LTL trends and higher expansion across formats. We also factor in margin gains, helped by operating leverage on Metro’s recent tech/team investments and the margin turnaround in FILA (150-250bps impact in FY24/FY25). The recent Metro Crossover (all-day shoes) launch is a perfect match for evolving consumer preferences; new format ‘Shoe Depot’ should also help cater to the discount-seeking consumer better. Metro’s healthy balance sheet (~40% cash) makes it a go-to-partner for incoming global brands, and further portfolio augmentation remains a potential upside. Outlook We reiterate BUY on Metro, while revising up our TP by ~14% to Rs1,475 (60x Sep-27E pre-IndAS EPS).

Takeaways: 1) Havells’ capex in cables and white goods augurs well. 2) Retailer network has expanded to 260,000 in FY25, from ~100,000 in FY16 – at a CAGR of 11.6%. The electrician network has expanded from 150,000 in FY16 to 301,000 in FY25. 3) Havells has invested INR 6,244mn towards brand-building activities. Given its investments in BTL activities, we believe Havells has probably a higher share-of-voice than most peers. 4) With operating leverage, cost-saving initiatives and investments in market share gains, Lloyd has turned profitable in FY25, having posted losses over FY22-24. Outlook We remain positive on Havells given its strong competitive advantages such as wide product portfolio, strong distribution network and established brand portfolio. We maintain BUY with a DCF-based TP of INR 1,800, implying target P/E of 53x FY27E.

Buy Karur Vysya Bank; target of Rs 267 : ICICI Securities,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-karur-vysya-bank-target-of-rs-267-icici-securities-13541952.html,"ICICI Securities research report on Karur Vysya Bank For Karur Vysya Bank (KVB), recovery from technical written-off (RTWO) contributed ~57bps to RoA (pre-tax) of ~2.3% for FY25. We note that disclosures and accounting for RTWO vary across banks; yet, KVB appears to exhibit the highest contribution from RTWO. While investors are justified in considering RTWO as non-core, we argue that for KVB it can be recurring (though moderating) in the near term. KVB’s RTWO rate (~14% of O/s pool) is comparable vs. peers. Importantly, there is a massive difference in the quantum (~2–10x of the peers as proportion of loans / GNPA) and quality (new vintage, secured and with some recourse) of the pool. We model an unchanged mild moderating RTWO trajectory, but believe that RTWO should sustain healthy contribution at ~0.4%/0.3% for FY26E/FY27E. Maintain BUY with unchanged PAT/target multiple. Target price is revised to reflect the bonus share adjustment. Outlook There is no change in our estimates. We maintain BUY on KVB with an unchanged target multiple of ~1.65x on FY27E ABV. Our target price, is, however, adjusted to INR 267 (vs. INR 320 earlier), due to the 1:5 bonus share adjustment.

The impact of the hike was still visible in 1QFY26, with volume dipping 13% YoY to 0.93m tons, while realization improved 17% YoY to INR7,852/tons. Though volumes declined due to this restructuring, EBITDA grew 74% YoY to INR1.5b, with margins at 20.4%, aided by better realizations, lower fuel costs, reduced lorry hire charges, and improved procurement efficiency (refinery sourcing at 41.5% vs. 33% YoY). Realizations are expected to remain stable, and no more pricing action is planned unless cost dynamics shift. FY26 volume growth is likely to remain flattish YoY, but FY27 is poised for 7-8% growth. Outlook We expect VRLL to clock flat volumes and a revenue/EBITDA/PAT CAGR of 6%/10%/19% over FY25- 27. Reiterate BUY with a TP of INR350 (based on 24x FY27 EPS).

"Auto stocks snap three-day losses as Citi cites trifecta of macro tailwinds; Maruti, Hyundai rise up to 1.5%",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/auto-stocks-snap-three-day-losses-as-citi-cites-trifecta-of-macro-tailwinds-maruti-hyundai-lead-gains-13541563.html,"Auto shares rebounded on Friday after three straight sessions of losses, with Maruti Suzuki India and Hyundai Motor India leading the gains, as brokerage firm Citi highlighted multiple macro triggers supportive of the sector. The Nifty Auto index rose nearly 1 percent in early trade, emerging among the top sectoral gainers. The rebound came after profit-booking in the previous three sessions, which followed four consecutive days of gains spurred by the GST Council’s decision to cut taxes on several categories of vehicles. Citi, in its note, said a combination of income tax restructuring, interest rate cuts and the recent GST rate revisions are expected to provide a favourable environment for the automobile industry, reported CNBC-TV18. The brokerage raised its price targets on key auto companies — Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd and Hyundai Motor India Ltd. It reiterated a ""buy"" rating on all three counters, projecting Maruti at Rs 17,500, M&M at Rs 4,170 and Hyundai at Rs 2,900. Maruti Suzuki remains Citi’s top pick in the sector. At around 10:45 am, shares of Maruti Suzuki were up 1.53 percent at Rs 15,326, Hyundai Motor India rose 1.33 percent to Rs 2,541.10, while Mahindra & Mahindra advanced 0.5 percent to Rs 3,612. The three stocks have gained between 10 percent and 20 percent over the past month. Citi noted that the combination of lower interest rates, tax changes and GST cuts could drive industry growth beyond its earlier projections.

Luggage makers VIP and Safari are a bet on travel surge and premiumisation as MOSL initiates with Buy calls,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/luggage-makers-vip-and-safari-are-a-bet-on-travel-surge-and-premiumisation-as-mosl-initiates-with-buy-calls-13541475.html,"Domestic luggage makers VIP and Safari are now on Motilal Oswal's coverage list after the brokerage initiated with Buy recommendations on September 12, backing the post-pandemic demand surge to continue, with premiumisation and e-commerce driving the expansion. The note said India's luggage industry is poised to reach Rs 26,700 crore turnover by CY28 at a CAGR of 12% between CY23-28, with established players driving the growth. ""Branded players, holding a 52% market share in CY23, are expected to outpace overall industry growth, propelled by rising disposable incomes, rapid urbanization, and resurgence in both domestic and international travel,"" said MOSL. The shift from unbranded to branded will be driven by innovation, premiumization and e-commerce, said Motilal, spurring both volume and value growth in the organized segment. MOSL cited industry observers who believe that luggage is now increasingly being seen as A 'status symbol', helped by social trends. The leading brands in India - VIP, Samsonite and Safari - together command around 33% of the market share. Motilal Oswal said it is initiating coverage on VIP and Safari Industries with Buy ratings and targets of Rs 530 per share and Rs 2,700 per share respectively. Over the last six months, shares of VIP Industries are higher by 54 percent, while those of Safari Industries are higher by 13 percent. The mass market of sub-Rs 4,000 luggage makes up the bulk of first-time buyers of brands at around 60 percent of the market, said MOSL, which translates into Rs 10,200 crore of turnover. This category is driven by brands like Safari, Aristocrat and Kamiliant with aggressive pricing and strong distribution network. The mid-market segment is dominated by VIP (21% share via VIP and Skybags) and American Tourister (around 17% shares), which have 'strong brand recall and omnichannel presence'. These players are targeting 'upwardly mobile, value-conscious consumers', with smart designs, seasonal launches, and curated retail formats, said MOSL. The premium segment, which is about 10% of the market, is dominated by legacy brands like Samsonite and Carlton - commanding 20 percent and 8 percent market share - that are maintaining leadership in the business and international travel segments. ""...premium luggage is evolving into a lifestyle accessory — blending status, style, and self-expression — fuelled by rising incomes, social aspirations, and the growing influence of digital culture,"" said Motilal Oswal. The segment is seeing new D2C entrants like Mokobara and Uppercase leveraging a digital-first strategy and influencer marketing to resonate with millennial and Gen Z consumers.

"Silver futures cross Rs 1.3-lakh mark; MCX, Hindustan Zinc shares rise up to 3%",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/silver-futures-cross-rs-1-3-lakh-mark-mcx-hindustan-zinc-shares-rise-up-to-2-13541492.html,"Silver prices jumped on September 12, outperforming gold. Future contracts of the precious-industrial metal hit fresh record highs, pushing the shares of MCX and Hindustan Zinc higher into the green. Silver futures with December expiry hit a fresh all time high of Rs 1,28,612 per kilogram on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) today. Silver contracts with March expiry rose nearly Rs 1,600 (over 1 percent) to hit Rs 1.3 lakh per kilogram for the first time ever. In the domestic market, the price of silver jumped Rs 2,100 per kilogram in a single day to Rs 1.32 lakh per kg, according to data on Investorgain. Gold futures on MCX with October expiry meanwhile rose around Rs 575 per 10 grams to trade at Rs 1,09,656. They are currently close to their all-time high level of Rs 1,09,840 per 10 grams. The US Federal Reserve is set to hold its FOMC meeting from September 16 to September 17. Analysts increasingly expect the American central bank to cut its rates this time, amid weakening jobs data and rising pressure from President Donald Trump's administration. The US economy likely created 911,000 fewer jobs in the 12 months through March than previously estimated, according to the latest data from Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics. This further hiked rate cut hopes, which in turn boosted precious metals. Firm industrial demand from China also boosted silver prices. MCX shares jumped more than 2 percent to trade at Rs 7,735 apiece. The stock has so far fallen more than 5 percent in the past one month, but gained nearly 62 percent in the past six months. The stock is up nearly 23 percent in 2025 so far. The shares of Hindustan Zinc rose more than 3.5 percent to close at Rs 462.05 apiece on the back of a notable surge in silver prices in India. Hindustan Zinc is the largest producer of silver in India, and produces refined silver with a minimum 99.9 percent purity. The sharp rise in the bullion's prices is expected to further boost the stock.

Apollo Micro Systems shares extend rise as unit secures deal in US,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/apollo-micro-systems-shares-extend-rise-as-unit-secures-deal-in-us-13541476.html,"Shares of Apollo Micro Systems Ltd extended gains for the third straight session on Friday, rising 9 percent over the period, after its step-down subsidiary secured a defence technology agreement in the United States. The company said Apollo Strategic Technologies Pvt Ltd (ASTPL), a subsidiary of Apollo Defence Industries Pvt Ltd (ADIPL), has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Dynamic Engineering and Design Inc, USA. The pact covers technology transfer, co-development and potential licensed production of rocket motors for BM-21 Grad ER and non-ER rockets. The agreement was signed at the DSEI exhibition in London on September 10, 2025. Apollo Micro Systems said the MoU marks a step towards indigenising propulsion technologies for multi-barrel rocket systems and advancing self-reliance in defence manufacturing under the government’s Make in India initiative. The group has already developed a 122mm rocket warhead in-house and plans to begin trials shortly, with full-scale production targeted by mid-2026. The collaboration will enable integration of indigenous warheads with domestically produced rocket motors, the company added. The BM-21 Grad rockets are among the most widely used unguided rockets globally. With this initiative, Apollo Micro Systems said it will become one of the few private Indian firms to offer a fully in-house developed rocket system, strengthening India’s position in the global defence supply chain.

Electric bus maker JBM Auto's shares soar 15 percent on IFC's largest e-mobility investment worth $100 million,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/electric-bus-maker-jbm-auto-s-shares-soar-7-percent-on-ifc-s-largest-e-mobility-investment-worth-100-million-13541438.html,"Auto ancillary player and maker of electric buses, JBM Auto has bagged $100 million of long-term capital from International Financial Corporation (IFC) to finance the deployment of e-buses across Maharashtra, Assam and Gujarat, sending the shares higher by nearly 15 percent on September 12. This is the largest ever e-bus deployment project undertaken by IFC, which is a World Bank Group entity, underscoring a rising interest to fund sustainable urban mobility projects. ""It marks IFC’s first capital investment in the e-bus sector in Asia and its largest globally, strengthening urban transport resilience across Indian cities,"" said JBM Auto. The investment is expected to speed up e-bus deployment and enhance JBM’s edge in delivering sustainable mobility solutions, the auto OEM player said. JBM Auto has been deploying zero-emission public mobility solutions across cities in India and globally across Europe, Middle East, and the APAC region. Company's Vice Chairman and MD, Nishant Arya said the funding will help JBM Auto seek more such associations in the future. ""With over 11,000 buses deployed and under execution, we are proud to have clocked 200+ Mn e-kms and served over 1 Bn passengers till date. With trusted partners like IFC, this initiative serves as a strategic beginning to many more upcoming associations towards augmenting e-bus deployment with enhanced agility and scale,"" Nishant Arya said. JBM Auto has an orderbook of Rs 12,900 crore as of August 2025, including 2,411 buses under PM e-Bus Sewa. Central government schemes such as PM e-Bus Sewa and PM E-DRIVE are aimign to deploy of over 52,000 e-buses across India by 2030, with a long-term plan for 1 lakh e-buses under the Bharat Urban Megabus Mission. ""E-mobility is the future — and we are making it real through investments in leaders like JBM,"" Makhtar Diop, Managing Director, International Finance Corporation said, adding, ""India’s leadership is accelerating its own transition while shaping how cities worldwide finance the next generation of mobility."" In India, buses make up for 70-75% of public transport journeys via 20 lakh buses in operation, which JBM Auto said is a 'major opportunity' for electrification. India's e-bus market is growing rapidly and funding for such projects will be key to realise the target of 40% EV penetration by FY30. Industry estimates have pegged India's auto component market to reach $200 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 16% from 2024. Exports are seen as a primary engine for this growth, seen rising as an annual rate of 30% to touch as much as $100 billion. This growth could surpass India's domestic OEM consumption, projected to rise to $89 billion by 2030."
"Infosys shares jump 2% on higher-than-expected share buyback of Rs 18,000 crore",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/infosys-shares-jump-2-after-it-firm-approves-rs-18-000-crore-share-buyback-13541407.html,"The shares of Infosys jumped more than 2 percent on September 12 after the board of India's second largest IT company approved a share buyback proposal worth Rs 18,000 crore, its largest ever. The shares were trading at Rs 1,539.90 apiece in the early hours of the session, as investors cheered higher than expected share buyback announcement. In an exchange filing released in the post market hours of September 11, Infosys announced that the share buyback program does not exceed 25 percent of the aggregate paid-up capital and accounts for 2.41 percent of the company. The buyback price has been set at Rs 1,800 per share. This is the first buyback of shares announced by Infosys since 2022, when the company had agreed to a buyback proposal of Rs 9,300 crore. The record date for the latest buyback programme is yet to be announced. A share buyback is a programme where a company buys back some of its shares from the existing shareholders. The buyback price of Rs 1,800 apiece is more than 19 percent higher than the stock's previous closing price of Rs 1,509.70 apiece. In an exchange filing released on September 12, Infosys said that it will receive some exemptive relief from the US SEC as a result of the share buyback due to ""conflicting regulatory requirements between Indian and U.S. laws for tender offer buybacks"". The Bengaluru-based IT major had cash and cash equivalents of over Rs 42,000 crore and free cash flow of over Rs 20,000 crore in FY25, giving it ample headroom for shareholder payouts. The buyback will be funded from its free reserves, in line with its capital allocation policy of returning 85 percent of free cash flow over five years through dividends and repurchases. Infosys shares gained more than 6 percent in the past five days, and over 8 percent in the past one month. The stock has fallen nearly 3 percent in the past six months, and is down more than 18 percent in 2025 so far. Should you buy, sell or hold? CLSA kept an 'Outperform' call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 1,861 apiece. This implies an upside potential of more than 23 percent from the stock's previous closing price. The buyback is expected to support stock price during the weak second half of FY26, it said. Nomura kept a 'Buy' call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 1,880 per share. This implies an upside potential of over 24 percent from the stock's previous closing price. The international brokerage expects the firm's CC revenue to grow 3.8 percent on-year in FY26. Morgan Stanley kept an 'Equal-weight' call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 1,700 per share. This implies an upside potential of nearly 13 percent from the stock's previous closing price. The international brokerage said that the firm's buyback size was higher than the Rs 10,000–14,000 crore size initially estimated. Amid macro uncertainty around Trump tariffs, Morgan Stanley sees the buyback as a vote of confidence in stability of FY26 guidance. In the first quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026, Infosys reported an 8.7 percent year-on-year rise in consolidated net profit to Rs 6,921 crore, beating expectations. Revenue for the quarter grew 7.5 percent on-year to Rs 42,279 crore. Infosys said it expects revenue growth of 1–3 percent in constant currency terms for FY26, revised up from 0-3 percent earlier. The firm maintained its operating margin guidance at 20–22 percent.

Asia joins global equity rally after US inflation,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/asia-joins-global-equity-rally-after-us-inflation-13540684.html,"Asia joined a global equity rally after relatively tame US inflation data and cooling jobs numbers clinched a path for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates next week. MSCI’s gauge of Asian shares rose for a seventh day and neared a fresh record, after the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indexes both climbed to fresh closing highs in New York. A gauge of global stocks also hit a new record. Contracts for US equities were little changed Friday. Microsoft Corp. shares climbed in post-market trading after the tech giant and OpenAI said they had reached an agreement, while Adobe Inc. shares also advanced in extended trading after it gave a strong quarterly revenue outlook. Elsewhere, Hyundai Motor Co. said a battery plant that was raided by US immigration authorities is being delayed as the companies faced labor shortages. US consumer price index data showed core prices that strip out food and energy rose 0.3% in August and 3.1% from a year earlier, in line with economists forecasts. Alongside that report came jobless-claims figures, which jumped to the highest in almost four years, emboldening bets policymakers will lower rates at its Sept. 16-17 meeting in an effort to counter a rapid slowdown in the labor market. “Inflation is relatively calm, which gives the Fed the flexibility to focus more on stemming ongoing weakness in the labor market,” said Skyler Weinand at Regan Capital. “We expect the Fed to cut 25 basis points next week and to follow through with another two 25 basis-point cuts this year.” Treasuries broadly held on to gains made on Thursday when the US 10-year yield fell two basis points. Australian and New Zealand yields fell Friday, echoing the move. Bloomberg’s index of the dollar was steady. Gold stabilized after a small Thursday decline after eclipsing its inflation-adjusted peak set in 1980. In Asia, data on the docket for release includes industrial production for Japan and inflation for India. Money supply and new loans data for China may be released any time through Sept. 15. In China, investors will be closely watching the Hong Kong-listed shares in Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd. after the company’s US-listed depositary receipts rallied 8% Thursday. Elsewhere, oil fell for a second day as a worsening market outlook undercut concerns about potential geopolitical disruptions to supplies. US Rate Cuts A slowing US jobs market has prompted markets to price a more aggressive trajectory of policy easing. Swaps pricing indicates traders anticipate the equivalent of between two or three 25 basis point cuts through year-end. “Right now, inflation is a key subplot, but the labor market is still the main story,” said Ellen Zentner at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. Thursday’s “CPI may appear to offset yesterday’s PPI, but it wasn’t hot enough to distract the Fed from the softening jobs picture. That translates into a rate cut next week — and, likely, more to come.” While there may be some murmurs within the Fed about the need for a 50 basis-point cut, an emergency-sized reduction is not required, said Seema Shah at Principal Asset Management. Jobless claims are still quite low compared to 2021 levels, while the broader economic activity data and earnings reports do not signal the US is approaching a recessionary tipping point."

About 1,406 shares declined against 1,360 advancing shares on the NSE. The market is expected to extend its bullish bias, given favourable technical and momentum indicators. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Hardik Matalia, Derivative Analyst at Choice Broking Berger Paints | CMP: Rs 551.35 Berger Paints saw a breakout from its prolonged consolidation range on the daily chart, supported by a noticeable surge in volumes. This breakout, coupled with a strong close, indicates fresh buying interest and suggests the possibility of a trend reversal. The stock has also crossed above its 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day EMAs, which further confirms a shift in its market structure towards a bullish bias. Momentum indicators align with this view as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 54.17, showing early signs of a positive crossover and strengthening momentum. Additionally, the stock has managed to close above its previous swing high, highlighting improving sentiment and increased participation from buyers at current levels. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 600 Stop-Loss: Rs 527 M&M Financial Services | CMP: Rs 271.5 M&M Financial Services consolidated in a wide range for the past few months and is now forming a Symmetrical Triangle pattern on the daily timeframe.

The momentum setup also supports this view, as the RSI stands at 60.74 and is showing an upward curve, suggesting strengthening momentum. Additionally, the stock is managing to hold above all its key moving averages, which further underlines the strength in its overall structure and supports the possibility of a bullish continuation if the breakout confirms. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 300 Stop-Loss: Rs 256 Cholamandalam Financial Holdings | CMP: Rs 1,881.1 Cholamandalam Financial Holdings witnessed a healthy retracement from its peak towards a key demand zone and is now showing signs of a potential reversal.

Both the RSI and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) are in positive territory, confirming the bullish momentum. While the Average Directional Index (ADX) at 17 suggests that the trend’s momentum is not yet very strong, the positive Directional Movement Index (+DMI) is dominating the negative Directional Movement Index (-DMI), indicating that bullish pressure is significantly increasing compared to bearish pressure.

The RSI is also trading in positive territory, and a bullish crossover in MACD and the signal line has occurred in a recent trading session, reinforcing the positive momentum building up. The trend indicators suggest that the previous negative trend is fading, and a new bullish trend may be about to begin. The positive Directional Movement Index (+DMI) has crossed above the negative Directional Movement Index (-DMI), which is a signal of increasing bullish strength and a potential trend reversal.

With RSI on daily timeframe charts being around 72, the stock is indicating strong momentum conditions. With the price taking off above its multi-year highs, we believe that the stock can move higher towards potential targets of Rs 80 and above.

Click to View More Outlook for September 12 Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets traded in a subdued manner on Thursday and ended marginally higher, taking a breather after the recent surge. After a positive start, the Nifty moved in a narrow range throughout the session and finally settled at 25,005.5 level. Sectoral performance was mixed, with energy and pharma emerging as top gainers, while IT and auto witnessed profit booking. Meanwhile, the broader indices remained largely flat, underperforming the large-cap space. It appears that markets have absorbed the initial reaction to favorable developments such as GST reforms and optimism around US–India trade talks, and may now witness a brief pause. However, rotational buying across key sectors and early signs of a reversal in themes like defense and railways are likely to keep the undertone positive. Amid this backdrop, we continue to advocate a “buy on dips” strategy in the index and suggest focusing on accumulating quality names across sectors and themes that are moving in line with the benchmark. Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities The upmove with range bound action continued in the market on Thursday and Nifty closed the day with modest gains of 30 points. After opening on a negative note, the market recovered initially but later shifted into a usual small range movement and that continued till the end. A small positive candle was formed on the daily chart with minor upper shadow. Technically this action signals a range bound action in the market. Though, Nifty placed at the crucial hurdle of 25000 mark (down sloping trend line and previous two weeks highs) but not showing any strength to witness a decisive break out of the hurdle. The recent opening upside gap of 9th and 10th Sept remains unfilled. The underlying trend of Nifty remains positive with choppy movement. Any failure to move sharply above the important resistance of 25000-25100 levels in the next 1-2 sessions could open short term weakness in the market. Immediate support is at 24800.

"PSU bank stocks gain for 2nd day on consolidation buzz; PNB, Canara Bank, others rise up to 2%",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/psu-bank-stocks-gain-for-2nd-day-on-consolidation-buzz-pnb-canara-bank-others-rise-up-to-2-13539109.html,"The shares of several public sector banks (PSB) rose on September 11, pushing the Nifty PSU Bank index higher into the green in the afternoon. This comes as reports on further consolidation of these lenders boosted investor sentiment. The Nifty PSU Bank index rose nearly 1 percent to 7,089, extending gains for the second consecutive session. The government is expected to revisit the consolidation plans of these PSBs in an effort to create larger and more globally competitive lenders, The Economic Times reported on September 10, citing sources. The issue will be taken up at the upcoming PSB Manthan which is scheduled to begin tomorrow, it added. The last major round of restructuring in 2019-2020 had brought down the number of state-run lenders from 27 to 12. A senior official told ET that while there is a recognized need for Indian banks to scale up globally, any new round of consolidation will depend on synergies and consultations with the lenders themselves. The aim would be to form at least three to four very large banks, it added. ET further reported that the two-day summit will also include discussions between PSBs and key infrastructure financing entities such as the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID) and India Infrastructure Finance Company (IIFCL). Moneycontrol couldn't independently verify the report. Punjab National Bank (PNB) and Canara Bank shares were the top gainers on the index, rising nearly 2 percent each. UCO Bank, Punjab & Sind Bank (PSB), Bank of Maharashtra and Bank of India shares rose more than 1 percent each. Union Bank of India, Central Bank of India and State Bank of India (SBI) shares rose nearly 1 percent each, while Indian Bank, Bank of Baroda and Indian Overseas Bank shares were hovering in the green with marginal gains. As of the June quarter, four public sector banks, which are UCO Bank, Indian Overseas Bank, Punjab & Sind Bank, and Central Bank of India, had government shareholding levels exceeding 90 percent. In 2019, the government initiated a large-scale consolidation drive in the PSU banking space, merging 10 public sector lenders into four larger entities.

Buy Coal India; target of Rs 450: Motilal Oswal,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-coal-india-target-of-rs-450-motilal-oswal-13538851.html,"Motilal Oswal's research report on Coal India India’s total installed power capacity reached ~490GW as of Jul’25, grew at 7.8% CAGR over the past 15 years. Renewable energy (~237 GW, 49% share) has surpassed thermal capacity (~220 GW, 44% share), where RE and thermal grew at 10.9% and 6.5% CAGR, respectively, over the past 15 years. Despite decarbonization efforts, coal remains a critical source for India’s power demand, contributing ~65-75% of power generation. Therefore, with rising industrial/household activity, coal demand is expected to remain firm. Coal India (COAL) accounts for over ~70% of the total coal production in India (including captives/others), of which over 80% is supplied to the power sector, positioning it as a dominant player in the coal mining space. COAL’s earnings are expected to remain under pressure in FY26, driven by a lack of volume growth amid muted power demand as well as the rising share of captive/merchant mining during Apr-Jul’25. Moreover, subdued global coal prices will continue to cap COAL’s e-auction prices/demand. Outlook At CMP, the stock is trading at 4x on FY27E EV/EBITDA at its 10-year historical average. We reiterate our BUY rating with a TP of INR450/share, valuing the stock at 4.5x FY27E EV/EBITDA.

This comes as investors may have resorted to profit booking, a day after the stocks recorded massive gains. The stocks had seen significant surge on September 10 (Wednesday) after US President Donald Trump said Washington and New Delhi will resume negotiations to resolve the ongoing trade frictions. Apex Frozen Foods shares dropped over 4 percent to trade at Rs 246.28 apiece in the morning, while those of Avanti Feeds plunged 4 percent to trade at Rs 728.60 apiece. The two stocks had rallied 17 percent and 15 percent respectively yesterday. Among the textile stocks, Welspun Living shares dropped over 2 percent to trade at Rs 122.50 apiece. Raymond Lifestyle shares meanwhile fell nearly 2 percent to trade at Rs 1,286 apiece. The stocks had jumped 10 percent and 2 percent respectively the previous day. In a social media post on Truth Social, Trump announced, ""I am pleased to announce that India, and the United States of America, are continuing negotiations to address the Trade Barriers between our two Nations."" ""I look forward to speaking with my very good friend, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in the upcoming weeks. I feel certain that there will be no difficulty in coming to a successful conclusion for both of our Great Countries!"" he further wrote. The shares of these export-oriented companies had significantly declined earlier after the Trump administration increased tariffs on Indian imports to a whopping 50 percent, citing New Delhi's continued purchase of Russian oil. However, Trump's latest comment may have boosted investor sentiment on the possibility of the two countries concluding their long-awaited tariff deal. Additionally, the US Supreme Court has agreed to decide the legality of Donald Trump's sweeping global tariffs. This comes after a lower court ruled that Trump’s tariffs were illegal.

Nomura sees 30 percent upside for Gail India on one-time boost from tariff hike and petchem recovery,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/nomura-sees-30-percent-upside-for-gail-india-on-one-time-boost-from-tariff-hike-and-petchem-recovery-13538349.html,"Shares of Gail India are higher by over 2.5 percent to be the top F&O gainer in the trading session on September 11, after brokerage Nomura issued a Buy call with a target of Rs 225 per share, which is nearly 30 percent higher than the last closing price, projecting that the company will get a one-time benefit from the proposed tariff hikes. Nomura said a tariff hike could provide a one-time boost to Gail India, with an integrated tariff increase of over 20 percent could potentially surprise investors on the upside. The note also said that Gail's petchem segment is expected to start seeing a recovery from FY27e onwards, contributing to the high investor interest in the stock. Gail India has already seen volumes of 55 lakh shares, at more than half of its one-month and one-week average. On a YTD basis, shares of Gail India are lower by 6.7 percent, and over the last one year, the shares are down 18 percent. However, over the last three years, Gail India shares are higher by 93 percent. The month of September has traditionally been positive for the stock, with the company delivering positive returns in 13 out of last 17 years during the month. The company has submitted a request to Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) for a 33 percent increase in gas tariff to Rs 78/mmbtu, citing rising cost of substitute gas used by compressors in pipeline operations, since gas allocation under Administered Price Mechanism (APM) has been cut to zero. Also, the capacity determination by PNGRB for GAIL’s integrated pipeline has come out to be lower than previously expected. Gail's revenue from operations from natural gas transmission in FY25 rose by 7 percent on year to Rs 11,068 crore due to increase in transmission volume and upward revision in tariffs. The company has a near 65 percent share in India's natural gas transmission. Nomura said it expects tariffs to be revised to around Rs 70/mmbtu with effect from April 2026, which is an increase of 19.5 percent. According to the note, this should translate into a 42 percent on year rise in gas transmission EBIT during FY27e, and the consolidated group EBIT is expected to rise by 24 percent. Gail is India's largest state-run natural gas processing and distribution company, with interests in domestic and overseas oil and gas assets, renewable energy and City Gas Distribution as well as Compressed Biogas. The regulator is in the process of finalising the integrated tariff of Gail India, which is an integral part of the 'Unified Tariff'.

After gaining up to 5.5 percent in the past two sessions on hopes of a US Federal Reserve rate cut, the Nifty IT index slipped nearly 1 percent, making it one of the top sectoral losers. Nine out of 10 constituents traded in the red. Persistent Systems led the fall, declining up to 2 percent to Rs 5,326 apiece on the NSE. Infosys dropped 1.38 percent as investors tracked for updates from the board of IT major which convenes today to consider a proposal for share buyback, which will be the first one in three years, and fifth in last eight years. Decision on Infosys buyback closely watched as board considers first proposal in three years LTIMindtree shed 1.66 percent. Wipro, HCL Technologies, Tech Mahindra and Mphasis also traded lower, slipping up to 1.3 percent. Tata Consultancy Services was the sole gainer, edging up 0.14 percent. The recent rally in IT shares was fuelled by expectations of a Fed rate cut and easing trade concerns after US President Donald Trump said Washington and New Delhi would resume talks to resolve trade differences. Indian IT firms derive a significant share of their revenue from the US market. However, sentiment turned cautious as investors awaited US consumer price index (CPI) data, due later in the day, following weaker-than-expected producer price numbers. A Reuters poll projected CPI to rise 0.3 percent month-on-month in August, after a 0.2 percent increase in July. On a year-on-year basis, CPI was seen at 2.9 percent versus 2.7 percent in July.

The stock was actually trading in the red with marginal losses at Rs 596 apiece. Patanjali Foods' board of directors during a meeting in July had approved the issue of bonus shares in the ratio of 2:1. The record date to determine the eligibility of the shareholders set to receive the bonus equity shares was set on September 11. A company announces bonus issue of shares to reward its existing shareholders with an investment opportunity, which is perceived to be attractive. While the issue of bonus shares increases the total number of shares issued and owned, it does not change the market capitalization of the company. This increases the overall liquidity of the stock, and makes it more affordable for other investors to add to their portfolio, creating strong upside potential for the stock. As a result, Patanjali Foods shares appeared to have crashed 67 percent in one session, while in reality, they simply adjusted to the bonus issue. After the issuance of bonus shares, the company's market capitalization stands at around Rs 64,856 crore and the stock's P/E ratio nears 18. The issuance of bonus shares will likely increase investors' confidence for the stock, as it reflects on the firm's strong financials and growth potential. Bonus issue essentially are free shares offered by a company from its reserves. Investors must own shares of the company as on the record date to be eligible for the bonus issue.

Decision on Infosys buyback closely watched as board considers first proposal in three years,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/decision-on-infosys-buyback-closely-watched-as-board-considers-first-proposal-in-three-years-13538243.html,"Investors will closely track for updates as the board of IT major Infosys convenes today to consider a proposal for share buyback, which will be the first one in three years, and fifth in last eight years. Shares of the company opened quiet on September 11 but slipped nearly a percent lower to be the top loser on Nifty 50. The shares have gained 2.6 percent in last one week and 6.6 percent over last one month, while on a YTD basis, shares of Infosys are lower by 19 percent. Market participants will be closely watching for the size of the buyback and how much of its cash reserves will the company deploy to purchases shares from investors. Also on radar will be the premium that the company will offer in order to buy back the shares. The timing of the buyback is also interesting, coming at a time for ongoing tariffs by US President Trump on Indian exports, and when the US economy has been facing risks of a slowdown, and amid calls of curb on US H1-B visas among Trump's supporters. In a recent note, Morgan Stanley has said that it sees a buyback of around Rs 10,000-14,000 crore by Infosys, coming in at around 18-25 percent premium to the current price. As of June 2025, Infosys was sitting on cash on books worth Rs 24,500 crore. Infosys has a high cash-generating business with access to global capital. The company's primary source of funds is cash from operations and income from short and long-term investments, among others. ""Our strong performance on the back of meticulous execution over the years, as reflected in the combination of high growth, strong cash generation and profitability, has led to building a strong, debt-free, and liquid Balance Sheet,"" the company had said in its annual report for FY25. The company has returned nearly Rs 88,400 crore, or 85% of the cumulative free cash flow between FY20-24 through dividends and buybacks, as part of its capital allocation policy. During the year ended March 31, 2025, Infosys paid an interim dividend of Rs 21 per share and announced a final dividend of Rs 22 per share. In the last five years preceding FY25, Infosys had purchased and extinguished a total of 11.62 crore fully paid-up equity shares from stock exchanges. The company has only one class of equity shares and even ADR holders are eligible for the buyback. Motilal Oswal has a Neutral call on Infosys with a target price of Rs 1750, and Prabhudas Lilladher has an Accumulate call with the same target. The IT space has not seen a buyback from the top-tier names in the last two years, and both Wipro and TCS are eligible to come out with their own, thus Infosys' board decision a closely watched by market participants. Both TCS and Wipro have conducted five buybacks each between 2016-2023, whereas Infosys has carried out four buybacks since 2017. The IT services major had revised its full-year revenue growth guidance for FY26 to 1-3 percent growth in constant currency (CC), increasing the lower end of the range.

Track the latest updates on GIFT Nifty right here on Moneycontrol. Indian benchmark indices extended the previous session gains with Nifty crossing 25,000 intraday on September 10, led by IT, financial, realty names. However, profit booking in auto and media stocks erased some of the intraday gains. At close, the Sensex was up 323.83 points or 0.40 percent at 81,425.15, and the Nifty was up 104.5 points or 0.42 percent at 24,973.10. BSE midcap and smallcap indices rose 0.7% each. Here is how financial markets across the globe fared overnight: GIFT Nifty (Up) The GIFT Nifty is trading marginally higher at around 25,089.50, indicating a muted start for the day. Asian Equities (Gain) Asian equities were mixed Thursday after a rally on Wall Street drove stocks and bonds higher, as a drop in producer prices supported bets the Federal Reserve will resume cutting interest rates next week. US Equities (Mixed) The S&P 500 and Nasdaq notched record-high closes on Wednesday, as Oracle surged and cooler-than-expected inflation data supported expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next week. Oracle soared 36% in its biggest one-day percentage gain since 1992 after the tech company pointed to a demand surge from AI firms for its cloud services. The S&P 500 climbed 0.30% to end the session at 6,532.04 points, closing with a record high for the second straight day. The Nasdaq gained 0.03% to 21,886.06 points for its third consecutive record-high close. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.48% to 45,490.92 points US Bond Yield (Mixed) The yield on 10-year Treasuries were up marginally while 2-year Treasuries were down marginally in the early trade on Thursday. Dollar Index (Flat) The dollar stabilised in early Asian trading hours on Thursday after an unexpected drop in U.S. factory-gate prices bolstered expectations the Federal Reserve will cut rates next week and traders awaited U.S. consumer price data due later in the day. Asian currencies (Gain) Asian currencies were trading lower in the early Thursday trade with Taiwan Dollar leading the gainers. However, year-to-date basis, except Indonesian Rupiah, all other currencies were trading higher. Crude (Flat) Oil steadied after a three-day gain as investors weighed Donald Trump’s latest comments regardingRussia and whether the US president will follow through with measures to punish Moscow for the Ukraine war. Gold (Up) Gold steadied just below a record after a surprise drop in US producer prices supported the case for the Federal Reserve to ease policy. Fund Flow Action The Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) sold equities worth Rs 115 crore on September 10, while Domestic institutional investors (DIIs) purchased equities worth Rs 5004 crore on the same day.

Asian shares steady as US stocks climb into CPI,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/asian-shares-steady-as-us-stocks-climb-into-cpi-13537347.html,"Asian equities were mixed Thursday after a rally on Wall Street drove stocks and bonds higher, as a drop in producer prices supported bets the Federal Reserve will resume cutting interest rates next week. Shares in Australia fell while those in Japan swung between gains and losses in early trading. US futures edged higher after the S&P 500 rose 0.3% to a new record Wednesday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 ended the session fractionally higher. Treasuries were steady after a rally across the curve Wednesday, while Australian and New Zealand government bonds rose Thursday. An index of the dollar was little changed while the yen strengthened against the greenback early Thursday. The Wednesday moves in the US reflected fresh optimism that the Fed will cut rates next week after producer prices unexpectedly declined for the first time in four months. The data soothed worries that elevated inflation would create a challenge for policymakers trying prevent a jobs downturn ahead of US inflation figures due later Thursday. “Investors are now contemplating the extent to which August’s payrolls, the benchmark revisions, and PPI should drive a conversation about a 50 basis-point cut next week,” said Ian Lyngen and Vail Hartman at BMO Capital Markets. “We are still in the 25 basis-point cut camp. For a half-point to be a real possibility, tomorrow’s core-CPI move will need to underwhelm.” Monthly US producer prices excluding food and energy declined 0.1% in August from the prior month, falling short of consensus estimates of a 0.3% increase, while July’s figure was also revised down. The data may indicate firms are trying to stay competitive to maintain market-share, said Neil Dutta at Renaissance Macro Research. “The Fed should cut 50 basis points next week — but I don’t think they will,” Dutta said. “The doves on the FOMC have a very strong case to make. The hawks will argue that the unemployment rate is still low, financial conditions are loose, and that there is still upward inflation pressure in front of us due to tariffs.” In Asia, data set for release Thursday includes inflation expectations in Australia and industrial production in Malaysia. Later Thursday, the European Central Bank is expected to keep interest rates unchanged. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is seeking to raise $3.17 billion in an offering of zero-coupon convertible notes that’s set to be the year’s biggest, according to terms of the deal seen by Bloomberg News. The company’s ADRs fell 2.2% in New York trading Wednesday. Elsewhere, US President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged to talk and resume trade negotiations, signaling a possible thaw after weeks of a blistering fight over tariffs and Russian oil purchases. US Inflation Core CPI, a measure of underlying inflation excluding food and fuel, probably rose 0.3% for a second month, according to the Bloomberg survey median estimate. A weaker-than-expected reading may prompt further speculation for a 50 basis point Fed cut next week. The combination of a moderation in jobs growth and still-manageable inflation should keep the Fed on track to cut rates, with a 25-basis-point cut expected in September to be followed by three additional consecutive cuts of the same size by January 2026, according to Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi at UBS Global Wealth Management. “Tomorrow’s CPI will carry more weight, but today’s PPI print essentially rolled out the red carpet for a Fed rate cut next week,” said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley. “After last week’s jobs report, though, the market was already expecting the Fed to begin an easing cycle, so it remains to be seen how much of a near-term impact this will have on sentiment.” In commodities, gold rose early Thursday after gains in the prior session and oil rose for a fourth day as investors weighed Trump’s next moves to pressure Russia, raising concerns over crude supplies. Meanwhile, Mexico is looking to apply tariffs of as much as 50% on cars, auto parts, steel and textiles from China and other countries with which it does not have a trade agreement, according to Economy Minister Marcelo Ebrard."

The stock is also sustaining above its 20-EMA and 50-EMA, which underpins a constructive bias.
