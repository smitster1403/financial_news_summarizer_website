"Rakesh Gangwal family set to offload 3.1 percent stake in IndiGo via block deals worth Rs 7,020 crore",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/rakesh-gangwal-family-set-to-offload-3-1-percent-stake-in-indigo-via-block-deals-worth-rs-7-020-crore-13492181.html,"The Rakesh Gangwal family is set to offload as much as 3.1 percent of their stake in InterGlobe Aviation through block deals worth approximately Rs 7,020 crore, CNBC Awaaz reported citing sources familiar with the development. The floor price of the block is pegged at Rs 5,808 per share, which will be a 4% discount to last traded price, and is likely to be executed on August 28. The transaction reflects a continued and gradual exit by the Gangwal family from IndiGo, after Rakesh Gangwal stepped down from the airline's board in February 2022. In 2025 alone, the Gangwal family has offloaded as much as 9 percent stake. As recently as May, a block deal was executed in IndiGo shares worth around Rs 11,900 crore. Shares of Interglobe Aviation are higher by 31 percent so far this year, and over the last five years, they are higher by 400 percent. As recently as last week, IndiGo was announced to be included in the benchmark Nifty 50 index, as a part of the semi-annual index reshuffle. For the June quarter, the low-cost airline posted a profit of Rs 2,161 crore, down 21 percent as compared to a year ago. Revenue from operations for IndiGo rose 5 percent to Rs 20,496 crore from a year-ago period. In a recent note, Kotak Securities has noted IndiGo’s capacity cuts were likely occurring at a slightly faster pace than its key competitor, however, the brokerage clarified that it was not a sign of weakening demand. Unlike its earlier approach of adding capacity in Q2 ahead of strong Q3 and Q4 demand, IndiGo is now focusing on measures to support yield growth during the festive season, Kotak note said."
"Chartist Talk: Bet on these 2 stocks with worst over for HUL, Maruti Suzuki looks overbought after 18% rally, says Centrum’s Nilesh Jain",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/chartist-talk-bet-on-these-2-stocks-with-worst-over-for-hul-maruti-suzuki-looks-overbought-after-18-rally-says-centrum-s-nilesh-jain-13491903.html,"According to Nilesh Jain, the Head - Equity Technical & Derivative Research at Centrum Broking, considering the stock has already rallied nearly 18 percent this month and the RSI is in overbought territory, the risk–reward does not appear favourable for fresh entries at current levels in Maruti Suzuki. The recent price momentum in HUL indicates that the worst may be behind, he said in an interview to Moneycontrol, adding the stock looks poised to scale new record highs beyond Rs 3,000 in the near term. He bets on Olectra Greentech, FSN E-Commerce Ventures Nykaa. ""Olectra is trading comfortably above all key moving averages, and has also witnessed a golden crossover, while Nykaa, on the weekly charts, has formed a strong base along with a Cup & Handle pattern, which is typically considered a trend reversal formation. Do you think the worst is over, though the charts are looking weak, or do you see the Nifty bears closing bullish gap? The Nifty index opened last week with a sharp gap-up and completed its 61.8% retracement of the decline from 25,669 to 24,338 at 25,160. However, the index soon faced sharp profit-taking, slipping below its 50-DMA at 25,010, which now acts as immediate resistance. The bullish gap has almost been filled, suggesting the possibility of near-term consolidation. On the downside, the 100-DMA at 24,660 remains a crucial support. A decisive break below this level could trigger a retest of the August low at 24,340. Unless this support zone is breached, the index is likely to oscillate in the broader range of 24,400–25,000. From a positioning standpoint, the FII long-short ratio has fallen to an extreme low of 10:90, highlighting aggressive bearish positioning, whereas DIIs have continued to remain net buyers through the August series. Overall, the technical setup appears weak, but with the monthly August expiry approaching, any positive trigger could spark a strong short-covering rally in the index. Do you see the strong possibility of more correction in Bank Nifty, or will it rebound from here on, though it saw a new August low? The Bank Nifty remains the key drag on the broader markets, weighing heavily on overall sentiment. The index is currently trading well below all its short-term moving averages and has witnessed a structural breakdown. It has already attempted to fill the gap created on May 12 near the 54,000 mark, and a complete fill looks increasingly likely. For any meaningful recovery, it is crucial for the index to reclaim the 21-DMA and 100-DMA, both placed around the 55,500 level. Until then, the technical setup remains weak. On the downside, immediate support is seen at 53,500, while the 200-DMA at 52,900 will act as a critical level to watch. Momentum indicators and oscillators on the weekly chart have triggered a sell crossover, reinforcing a sell-on-rise bias in the short term for the Bank Nifty. Do you see the uptrend continuing in Britannia Industries and Eicher Motors? The consumption space is back in focus, with defensives once again attracting attention amid prevailing market uncertainty. Britannia has been steadily inching higher, crossing above all its key short-term and long-term moving averages. A bullish crossover on the MACD, along with the RSI moving above 55, indicates strength and supports the likelihood of a continued uptrend. The stock has potential to move towards Rs 6,200, while immediate support is placed at Rs 5,530. Eicher Motors remains in a secular uptrend, now trading in uncharted territory. The recent breakout, supported by higher-than-average volumes, suggests strong momentum is intact. In the near term, the stock is poised to move towards Rs 6,500, while immediate support is placed at Rs 5,850. What are your top 2 bets? Olectra Greentech The stock is forming a large rounding bottom pattern and is gradually moving higher. It is trading comfortably above all key short-term and long-term moving averages, and has also witnessed a golden crossover, with the 50-DMA crossing above the 200-DMA, signalling strong momentum in the near term. Based on this setup, the stock is expected to move towards Rs 1,770, while a stop loss can be placed near its 21-DMA support at Rs 1,465. FSN E-Commerce Ventures Nykaa On the weekly charts, the stock has formed a strong base along with a Cup & Handle pattern, which is typically considered a trend reversal formation. A decisive breakout above Rs 232 would provide bullish confirmation, opening the way for an upside target near Rs 280 as per the pattern projection. Momentum indicators and oscillators are firmly in buy mode on both the daily and weekly timeframes, further supporting the positive outlook. On the downside, the 100-DMA at Rs 203 serves as a crucial support. Hence, the stock can be considered for addition post a breakout above Rs 232, with an upside potential towards Rs 280 and a stop-loss placed at Rs 203. Are you super bullish on Maruti and HUL, considering the charts? Maruti Suzuki has given a breakout from a triangle pattern near Rs 13,400, supported by a breakaway gap. The conservative target of this breakout is placed around Rs 15,500, while the aggressive target stands at Rs 16,500. However, considering the stock has already rallied nearly 18% this month and the RSI is in overbought territory, the risk–reward does not appear favourable for fresh entries at current levels. Instead, the stock can be accumulated in a staggered manner as a positional buy, with key support placed at Rs 13,400. Hindustan Unilever (HUL) has emerged from a four-year consolidation phase, and the recent price momentum indicates that the worst may be behind. The stock looks poised to scale new record highs beyond Rs 3,000 in the near term, with immediate support at Rs 2,520. What is the likelihood of the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices breaking their August lows? The broader markets have witnessed deeper cuts compared to the benchmark indices in the August series. Both the Nifty Midcap and Nifty Smallcap indices are currently trading below their respective short-term moving averages, signaling a weak near-term structure. The Nifty Smallcap index appears precariously positioned, hovering close to a breakdown from its long-term 200-DMA at 17,500. A breach below this level would further dent sentiment and intensify selling pressure. Meanwhile, the Nifty Midcap index continues to face stiff resistance near its 50-DMA at 58,000, where persistent supply has been observed. Although the index earlier managed to defend its 100-DMA, the same level is now being retested, highlighting vulnerability. Overall, the broader structure of both indices remains weak, with a high probability of breaking their August lows in the immediate term.

Asian shares post modest drop with focus on Nvidia,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/asian-shares-post-modest-drop-with-focus-on-nvidia-13491919.html,"Asian equities struggled for direction at the open Wednesday as investors awaited Nvidia Corp.’s earnings for guidance on where the markets head next after a strong rally since April. Shares edged up in Australia while gauges in Japan and South Korea were flat. Chips and the electronics sector were in focus with Nikon Corp. shares jumping 20% in Japan while Chinese artificial intelligence linchpin Cambricon Technologies Corp. swung to a record profit. US shares gained Tuesday, led by Nvidia before the tech giant’s hotly-anticipated earnings that are scheduled to report after the bell on Wednesday. A gauge of the dollar and longer-dated Treasuries steadied in Asia after they declined Tuesday following President Donald Trump’s push to oust Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. The gap between five and 30-year yields is at its steepest since 2021. While political meddling in monetary policy after Trump’s move drew much of the market’s focus, traders face key risks this week with Nvidia’s earnings and Friday’s inflation report. Even with tariff and geopolitical headlines flaring, investors remain anchored to a bullish market script: a likely September rate cut, resilient economic growth, and corporate earnings strong enough to keep equity sentiment afloat. “Equity markets will be looking squarely at Nvidia’s upcoming earnings report for cues as to whether the current bull run continues or stalls out,” wrote Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at KCM Trade. Nvidia’s earnings report is expected to give an update on the artificial intelligence spending boom — and how the US-China rivalry is limiting growth. Analysts estimate that the biggest buyers of AI hardware are still investing heavily in new gear, with the company’s sales set to grow at a pace of more than 50% this year. Dimming the excitement is confusion over how much business Nvidia will be able to do in China. “Nvidia’s results transcend the company, becoming a barometer of macroeconomic activity, a talisman for the artificial intelligence trade, and a critical pressure point for global geopolitics,” wrote Kyle Rodda, a senior market analyst at Capital.com in Melbourne. Meanwhile, Trump said he was prepared for a legal fight while the Fed, weighing in for the first time this week, said it would abide by any court decision in Cook’s legal challenge of her dismissal. The Fed’s perceived independence from government whims is a bedrock assumption of US markets, and any change to that perception could weigh on US credit ratings. “Trump’s push to fire Cook has exacerbated concerns about the Fed’s independence,” said Ian Lyngen at BMO Capital Markets. “While the price action in US rates has been largely contained to the recent range, many of the go-to hedges against an erosion of Fed independence outperformed on the news of Cook’s firing.” Separately, economic data Tuesday showed US orders for business equipment increased in July by more than projected, suggesting companies are moving forward on investment plans as uncertainty around trade and tax policy gradually diminishes. Also, consumer confidence fell slightly in August as Americans worried more about their prospects of finding a job. On the trade front, the US will slap a crushing 50% tariff on some Indian goods starting Wednesday — the highest in Asia — as Trump presses ahead with the levies to punish New Delhi for buying Russian oil."

Trading in derivatives, equities, SLBs, currency derivatives, and interest rate derivatives will remain shut for the day. The commodity derivatives segment will also remain closed in the morning session between 9:00 am to 5:00 pm, while it will remain open for the evening session between 5:00 pm to 11:55 pm. Trading on the NSE and the BSE will resume on August 28 (Thursday). On August 26, Indian equity indices ended on a weak note with Nifty around 24,700. At close, the Sensex was down 849.37 points or 1.04 percent at 80,786.54, and the Nifty was down 255.70 points or 1.02 percent at 24,712.05. Biggest Nifty losers were Shriram Finance, Sun Pharma, Tata Steel, Bajaj Finance, Trent, while gainers included Eicher Motors, HUL, Maruti Suzuki, Nestle India, ITC.

Among sectors, Capital Market, Defense, and Real Estate shed over 2 percent, whereas despite weak market sentiment, the FMCG index outperformed and rallied nearly 1 percent,"" said Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities. ""Technically, after a gap-down open, the market breached the crucial support zone of 24,850/81300, and post-breakdown, selling pressure intensified. Additionally, it also formed a long bearish candle on the daily charts and is holding a lower top formation on intraday charts, which is largely negative."" ""We believe that the intraday market texture is weak, but a fresh selloff is possible only after the dismissal of the 24650/80500. Below this level, the index could retest the level of 24,550-24500/80200-80000. On the flip side, above 20 day SMA or 24750/81000, a pullback move is likely to continue up to 24850-24900/81300-81500,"" Chouhan added. Indian rupee ended 10 paise lower at 87.68 per dollar on Tuesday versus Monday’s close of 87.58. ""The bias for the rupee still weak amid imbalance between dollar demand and supply. The local rupee got support from MSCI rebalance inflows in today’s session. Looking at the current market conditions, the rupee’s new low is looking imminent, while a move to 86.50 appears distant,"" said Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities. ""The short term traders will be eyeing on the trade tariff and GST rate rejig announcement. The spot USDINR has near term support at 87.25 and resistance at 87.90, he added.

The market regulator had conducted an inspection of KFin Technologies between February 19-23, 2024, for the period from February 1 to November 30, 2023. The inspection report alleged that the company failed to exercise due diligence while processing requests for dematerialisation of shares and did not mark over 17.9 lakh folios without PAN details and 17.7 lakh folios without bank account details for enhanced due diligence as required under Sebi’s circulars and master circular. Also read: Sebi panel recommends open offer process may be faster with quicker payout to investors Following the issuance of a show-cause notice in July 2024, KFin Tech filed a settlement application in August 2024, seeking to resolve the matter without prolonged litigation. The internal committee of Sebi initially recommended an indicative amount of Rs 87.75 lakh under the settlement framework, which was later agreed upon by the company. “The High-Powered Advisory Committee, in its meeting held on June 5, 2025, recommended that the case may be settled upon payment of Rs 87,75,000 (Rupees eighty-seven lakh seventy-five thousand only) as the settlement amount,” the order stated. The recommendations were approved by Sebi’s panel of Whole Time Members on August 8, 2025, and the company confirmed payment on August 25, 2025. Consequently, the adjudication proceedings were disposed of by Sebi. Under the settlement proceedings parties settle case with Sebi, without admitting or denying the guilt. However, Sebi retains the right to reopen the case if representations made during the settlement process are found to be incorrect. Moneycontrol had reported that number of settlement applications and amount of settlement has drastically gone up in financial year ended March 31st, 2025."

The Nifty ends 256 points lower, while the Sensex was down by 849 points. Among sectors, Capital Market, Defense, and Real Estate shed over 2 percent, whereas despite weak market sentiment, the FMCG index outperformed and rallied nearly 1 percent. Technically, after a gap-down open, the market breached the crucial support zone of 24,850/81300, and post-breakdown, selling pressure intensified. Additionally, it also formed a long bearish candle on the daily charts and is holding a lower top formation on intraday charts, which is largely negative. We believe that the intraday market texture is weak, but a fresh selloff is possible only after the dismissal of the 24650/80500. Below this level, the index could retest the level of 24,550-24500/80200-80000. On the flip side, above 20 day SMA or 24750/81000, a pullback move is likely to continue up to 24850-24900/81300-81500. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The Nifty fell sharply, breaking below the support level of 24,800. Today’s decline was severe, pushing the index under the critical 50-day EMA. The RSI has entered a bearish crossover, indicating weakening price momentum. In the short term, the index is likely to remain under selling pressure as long as it trades below 24,850. On the downside, the correction could extend towards 24,150 or lower.

Derivatives traders unwind positions ahead of holiday-shortened expiry week,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/derivatives-traders-unwind-positions-ahead-of-holiday-shortened-expiry-week-13488692.html,"Derivative equity markets saw cautious action on August 26 as traders trimmed positions ahead of Wednesday’s market holiday and the monthly expiry slated for Thursday, with impending Trump tariffs weighing on investors. US President Trump’s additional 25 percent tariffs on India are set to come into effect from August 27, keeping the sentiment weak as stocks tumbled sharply in late session on Tuesday. More Bets Against Upside The sentiment has likely shifted in the options setup, said Ajit Mishra, SVP at Religare Broking, adding that until Monday, put writers were active with 24,800 strike acting as a key support, implying a bet on stable markets. However, Tuesday’s market fall has been followed by call writers - those betting against further upside - turning aggressive at the same strike price of 24,800, effectively capping any meaningful upside. Why This Matters The open interest at 24,800 has now risen to nearly 1.4 crore contracts from 1.2 crore earlier. Below this, the 24,600 level is likely to act as a strong base, coinciding with the gap created on August 18 after PM Modi’s announcement of GST reforms, Mishra added. In simpler terms, traders who were earlier betting on 24,800 holding up as a ‘floor’ for the Nifty have now turned cautious, and fresh bets are building up on the downside. Sahaj Agarwal, Head of Derivatives Research at Kotak Securities said that while some downside is possible from current levels, the broader trend still indicates markets may remain sideways. “The weekly setup was corrective and the new developments on the tariff front have pushed the market downwards. Upside remains limited for sure, while on the downside a sustained move below 24,750 could invite further selling pressure,” he said. Premium Decay Rajesh Palviya, Senior Vice President – Technical and Derivatives Research at Axis Securities agreed with this narrow-band assessment. With Wednesday being a trading holiday, option writers could enjoy a one-day premium decay advantage. A premium decay advantage refers to the benefit that option sellers gain from the fall in an option's premium as it nears expiry. Driven by the erosion of time value, this decay allows sellers to profit from the natural loss of value in an option. “Unless there is a big move on expiry day, (option) writers will stay in control. Based on the current setup, expiry is likely to remain within the 24,800-25,000 band. Only a decisive move beyond this range could hurt writers, but till then, they remain in the comfort zone,” Rajesh Palviya said. Dhupesh Dhameja of SAMCO Securities said call writers have taken control, particularly at the 25,000 strike, where open interest has jumped to 1.57 crore contracts. This heavy writing signals that traders see 25,000 as a strong resistance zone and are betting against the index breaking past it in the near term. On the flip side, the 24,900 strike has emerged as a key support with nearly 96.82 lakh put contracts - the second-highest open interest on the put side. He added that the Put-Call Ratio (PCR) has improved from 0.61 to 0.77, indicating a gradual shift of put writers to slightly higher strikes. But call writers continue to dominate, keeping the upside in check. Kotak’s Sahaj Agarwal said the volatility could stay high, there is no structural weakness showing up in market data. What makes the positioning more relevant this week is the calendar. With a trading holiday on Wednesday and expiry on Thursday, market participants appear unwilling to carry aggressive bets. As a result, positions are being unwound or adjusted, and the 24,800-25,000 range has become the focus of action. The compressed window leaves little room for risk-taking, making expiry week volatile but range bound. Bank Nifty Meanwhile, Laxmikant Shukla, Sr. Technical Analyst of equities at YES Securities highlights that bank nifty remains a laggard. ""It has underperformed the benchmark index with sustenance below the recent low, and calls writing has shifted its range even lower. Therefore, the undertone is likely to remain negative as long as banknifty remains beneath 55k,"" he said. Sahaj Agarwal has pegged the support for Bank Nifty at 54,000, and sees the index relatively weaker compared to the broader market. SAMCO’s Dhupesh Dhameja said traders are turning defensive, with heavy call writing at the 55,500 strike and open interest rising to 22.49 lakh contracts, traders are viewing this level as a strong resistance. At the same time, the 55,000 strike holds the highest put open interest at 14.37 lakh contracts, making it an important support. However, put writers unwinding positions and shifting to lower strikes alongside call writers increasing bets at higher levels shows traders are less confidence of a sharp rally. The open interest in Bank Nifty has fallen by 5.02 percent while the price has dipped slightly by 0.06 percent. Falling OI, with a marginal price decline suggests long unwinding, as traders are closing out existing long positions fearing less chance of further gains.

The drop comes after a draft notice revealed US President Donald Trump’s plan to slap 50 percent tariffs on Indian goods. Markets will remain shut on August 27 on account of Ganesh Chaturthi. At close, the Sensex was down 849.37 points or 1.04 percent at 80,786.54, and the Nifty was down 255.70 points or 1.02 percent at 24,712.05.

Midcaps and Energy also slipped over a percent each, while Metals, Infra, Oil & Gas, and Private Banks declined in tandem. Among gainers, FMCG stood out with gains of over 1 percent, while Auto succumbed to selling pressure and ended in the red. Volatility edged higher, with India VIX rising more than 3 percent. Among individual stocks, India's leading auto major, Maruti Suzuki, closed 2 percent higher after Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the first of the two major projects at the Suzuki Motor Plant in Hansalpur, Gujarat. This includes the flag off of the first unit of the Maruti Suzuki e-Vitara to be rolled off the production line. It will be followed by the inauguration of the first plant to produce hybrid battery electrodes. The shares of pharma companies dropped in trade on August 26 after US President Donald Trump said that he would reduce drug prices in the US by a whopping ""1,400-1,500 percent"". He also reiterated his threat to slap higher tariffs on pharma imports. The index has now snapped a three-session gaining streak. Trump had earlier sent letters to major drug makers, demanding they lower drug prices in the US and bring them in line with what other nations are paying for new medicines. Shares of Vodafone Idea Ltd., declined as much as 9 percent on August 26, after having gained as much as 20 percent in the last six trading sessions, of which they gained in five. The fall came after Minister of State for Communications Chandra S Pemmasani ruled out any further relief to the debt-laden telecom operator.

Technical View Unless the index decisively clears 25,150, upward momentum is likely to remain capped. On the downside, sustaining above 24,800 is critical to prevent deeper corrections. For now, a “sell on rise” approach appears prudent, with traders awaiting a clear breakout above 25,100 or a breakdown below 24,800 for the next directional move. Ahead of the key tariff announcement on the 27th, the market is likely to witness sideways-to-volatile sessions. ""On the daily chart, the Nifty Bank index remains below all key moving averages except the 200-day moving average, highlighting that recovery attempts are being capped at higher levels. The index continues to hover close to the recent swing low of 54,905, which is acting as immediate support. A breakdown below this zone could drag the index further toward 54,600, which coincides with the 127.8 percent Fibonacci extension,"" Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities said. ""The broader trend remains fragile as long as the index stays below its short-term averages. Support is placed at 54,900, followed by 54,600, while resistance stays firm at 55,500–55,600. Until the index crosses above these hurdles, short-term moves may remain choppy with risks tilted toward the downside,"" he added. Eicher Motors, HUL, Maruti Suzuki, ITC, Nestle India, and TCS were the top gainers on the Nifty. Laggards on the index included Shriram Finance, Sun Pharma, Tata Steel, Bajaj Finance, and Trent.

"Raymond Lifestyle, KPR Mills, Avanti Feeds, other textile and shrimp stocks decline up to 5% on US tariff worries",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/raymond-lifestyle-kpr-mills-avanti-feeds-other-textile-and-shrimp-stocks-decline-up-to-5-on-us-tariff-worries-13489660.html,"Textile and shrimp stocks fell up to 5 percent on Tuesday after the United States issued a draft order to impose an additional 25 percent tariff on Indian imports, effective August 27. According to a notice from the US Department of Homeland Security, the tariffs will apply to Indian products “that are entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 am Eastern Daylight Time on August 27, 2025”. The move triggered concerns in the textile and shrimp sectors, with exporters fearing order cancellations and potential losses. Shrimp exporters, who send more than half their output to the US, expressed worry over the sharp increase in duty. There are fears that the textile and apparel orders could shift to rival exporters such as Bangladesh, China and Vietnam, which face lower tariffs. Sunny Agrawal, Head - Fundamental Research at SBI Securities, noted that the imposition of a 50% US tariff, effective from August 27, 2025, has raised concerns for Indian exporters, particularly in sectors like textiles and shrimp. Companies such as Gokaldas and Avanti Feeds have substantial exposure to the US market, and the steep tariff is expected to impact their sales volumes and margins. ""Going forward, these companies may trade with negative bias, depending on the duration and scope of the imposed tariffs. Export-dependent companies will need to reassess their pricing strategies and explore alternative markets to mitigate risks. Stocks have also already corrected materially post first announcement of likely 25% incremental tariff in the first week of August and to that extent most of the negatives are already priced in,"" he added. On the National Stock Exchange, Raymond Lifestyle declined nearly 3 percent to Rs 1,145 per share, while KPR Mill fell 4.6 percent to Rs 973.6. Trident and Gokaldas Exports slipped up to 3 percent each, and Garware Technical Fibres and Welspun Living were down up to 2 percent. Shrimp stocks also saw selling pressure. Avanti Feeds dropped 0.4 percent, while Apex Frozen Foods and Waterbase Ltd slipped up to 1 percent. Trade between the US and India is valued at over $190 billion. The higher duties come as part of Washington’s response to India’s continued oil trade with Russia, and mark one of the steepest tariff actions against a trading partner.

HDFC Bank shares adjust to bonus issue: Did the stock actually plunge 50% in one day?,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/hdfc-bank-shares-adjust-to-bonus-issue-did-the-stock-actually-plunge-50-in-one-day-13490156.html,"The shares of HDFC Bank closed at around Rs 972 apiece on August 26, which is around 50 percent lower than the previous closing price of Rs 1,964 apiece. This comes as the shares of India's largest private lender adjusted to a 1:1 bonus issue. HDFC Bank on July 19 had announced its first ever bonus issue of shares in the ratio of 1:1. The Mumbai-based private lender set August 27 (tomorrow) as the record date to determine the eligibility of the shareholders set to receive the bonus shares. Eligible shareholders will receive one bonus share for every single share of the company they own, as on record date. As stock markets will remain closed tomorrow on account of Ganesh Chaturthi, the stock adjustment may have taken effect today. While the issue of bonus shares increases the total number of shares issued and owned, it does not change the market capitalization of the company. This increases the overall liquidity of the stock. That is why, the price of HDFC Bank shares appears to have halved after the adjustment. Bonus issue essentially are free shares offered by a company from its reserves. Such issue is perceived to reflect on a firm's strong financials and growth potential. In actual terms, HDFC Bank shares dropped nearly 1 percent on August 26. The stock currently has a P/E ratio of over 41. Along with the bonus issue, the private lender had also announced a special interim dividend of Rs 5 per share, in its results for the first quarter of financial year 2026. HDFC Bank, on July 19, reported a decline in consolidated net profit to Rs 16,258 crore in Q1 FY26, down from Rs 16,475 crore a year ago, despite a one-time pre-tax gain of Rs 9,128 crore from the IPO of its subsidiary, HDB Financial Services. The bank's standalone net interest income (NII) expanded 5.4 percent to Rs 31,438 crore in Q1 FY26.

Sebi panel recommends open offer process may be faster with quicker payout to investors,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sebi-panel-recommends-open-offer-process-may-be-faster-with-quicker-payout-to-investors-13489945.html,"Companies may be able to process the open offer quicker and in efficient manner, as a regulatory panel has suggested tighter timelines for various processes. As per the sources, in its draft submitted to Sebi, the Takeover Review Panel has suggested reduction in various timelines related to the open offer. Currently, the overall timeline for completing an open offer is 62 working days. Suggestions if implemented can reduce open offer process to 42 working days, ensuring faster completion and quicker pay-outs to shareholders. Moneycontrol had previously reported the other regulatory changes proposed by the Takeover Review Panel of Sebi. The panel has also recommended reduction of timelines for various processes. The timelines suggested by Takeover Regulations Review panel for each activity have been recommended to be reduced. Faster Publication and Filing Process From the date of public announcement, the Detailed Public Statement (DPS) must be published within 3 working days against the current 5 working days. Similarly, Draft Letter of Offer (DLOF) must be filed with Sebi within 5 working days from the DPS against the 10 working days’ time, currently. Linking escrow deposit to the filing of the DLOF instead of the DPS, allowing the deposit to be made 2 working days before the DLOF filing. The rationale is key details such as offer size, price, and acquirer information are already available in the public announcement. Since additional disclosures in DPS and DLOF are incremental, timelines can be compressed without compromising investor interests. Dispatch of Offer Letters to be quickerCurrently, the Letter of Offer (LOF) must be dispatched to eligible shareholders within 7 working days of Sebi’s comments on the DLOF. Sebi panel proposes reducing this timeline to 5 working days, leveraging advancements in electronic communication. Panel is of the view that, with most shares now held in demat form, LOFs can be sent through email, eliminating logistical delays. A shorter Tendering PeriodThe tendering period for shareholders to submit their shares currently stands at 10 working days. Panel analysed the data and found over 91 percent of shares in open offers and 92 percent in buy-backs are tendered during the last 5 days of the period. Hence, panel proposed reducing the tendering period to 5 working days. A pre-offer advertisement, issued a day before the tendering starts, will continue to keep investors informed about offer price revisions. Faster Payments to investors Under the existing framework, acquirers have 10 working days after the tendering period to pay shareholders who have accepted the offer. Sebi panel now recommends reducing this to 5 working days, citing technological advancements such as T+1 settlement and the streamlined process. Since shares remain blocked in the shareholder’s demat account until settlement, risks are minimized. Quicker Post-Offer Public Announcements Post-offer advertisements, currently due within 5 working days of the offer closing, will now need to be published within 2 working days, as all necessary data is available immediately after closure. How the proposal will help If accepted and implemented by Sebi, these measures will reduce the overall open offer timeline by 20 working days. The revised structure aims to align open offer processes with delisting timelines. Speed up shareholder pay-outs. Enhance market efficiency. With retail investor participation at record highs, these changes are expected to instill greater confidence and convenience in corporate actions such as acquisitions and buy-backs. Sebi’s takeover panel proposal marks a significant shift toward digitisation and operational efficiency in capital markets. By cutting down redundant delays and leveraging technology for faster communication and settlement, the regulator seeks to make tender offers more transparent, swift, and investor-centric. It’s a draft report and the Sebi has not yet made the report public for consultation. As a process of regulation making Sebi seeks public feedback before final implementation."

"Sensex sheds over 550 pts, Nifty below 24,800 as tariff deadline looms; broader markets lag",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sensex-sheds-over-550-pts-nifty-below-24-800-as-tariff-deadline-looms-broader-markets-lag-13489030.html,"Indian benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty extended their decline in the afternoon session on August 26, coinciding with the BSE contracts expiry and just ahead of the looming 25 percent additional tariff deadline. The broader market mood was largely negative as most sectors traded in the red, with metals, pharma, and realty bearing the brunt of the selloff. Around noon, the Sensex had dropped 558.59 points, or 0.68 percent, to 81,077.32, while the Nifty slipped 169.35 points, or 0.68 percent, to 24,798.40. Market breadth remained weak, with 1,081 shares advancing, 2,453 shares declining, and 126 shares unchanged. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog The broader markets continued to underperform for the second straight day this week, as both the midcap and smallcap indices slid by about 1 percent each. Meanwhile, India VIX edged higher by 2 percent, reflecting elevated volatility during this monthly expiry week. From a sectoral perspective, Nifty FMCG grabbed attention amid renewed optimism around GST rationalisation, which is expected to revive consumption by streamlining taxes into two slab rates. The Nifty Auto index traded with a flat to mildly positive bias, which was evident in the Nifty’s top gainers’ list, dominated by Hindustan Unilever, Nestlé, Eicher Motors, Maruti Suzuki, and Tata Consumer Products. In contrast, Sun Pharma dragged the index lower, emerging as the top Nifty laggard after Bernstein downgraded the stock on account of risks to consensus earnings and stretched valuations. The brokerage issued an ‘underperform’ rating with a revised target price of Rs 1,570 per share, marking a 9 percent cut from its earlier estimate. Looking ahead, analysts at ICICI Securities observed that the market is attempting to digest multiple headwinds, including tariff uncertainties, geopolitical concerns, and persistent foreign institutional investor (FII) outflows. Analysts pointed out that the Nifty has consistently held the 24,500 mark on weekly closing basis for over three months, signaling a strong higher base formation that could support the next leg of the upmove. Meanwhile, Vaishali Parekh, Vice President - Technical Research at PL Capital, noted that Nifty’s immediate support is placed at 24,800, while resistance lies around 25,200 levels for the day.

Buy Petronet LNG; target of Rs 410: Motilal Oswal,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-petronet-lng-target-of-rs-410-motilal-oswal-3-13489011.html,"Motilal Oswal's research report on Petronet LNG We recently upgraded PLNG to BUY (Tide is turning, slowly) on inexpensive valuations and strong upcoming capacity growth. In this short note, we reiterate our BUY rating on PLNG and highlight: 1) PLNG’s market share in India’s LNG imports, which slipped to 69% of total imports in FY25 (FY15: 78%), could start to rise as new Dahej capacity starts operations; 2) Assuming a modest 4.5% CAGR in India’s natural gas (NG) consumption over FY25-30 and a 2% CAGR in domestic NG production, India’s LNG imports need to grow at a robust 6% CAGR (~32mmscmd increase in LNG imports over FY25-30), and this should benefit PLNG’s new expanded capacity; 3) Our current assumptions imply that PLNG secures only ~41% share of incremental import growth (69% of total imports in FY25); 4) Global liquefaction capacity is set to rise by 10%/11% YoY in CY26/27 (historical LNG demand growth: 5%-6%), likely ushering in an era of lower-for-longer LNG prices; 5) While brownfield expansion from existing terminals is a risk, we believe this is unlikely to play out given the lackluster utilization at existing facilities. Outlook As per our DCF analysis (WACC: 10.5%), at CMP, PLNG is pricing in an unrealistic scenario of a 20% decline in tariffs at the Dahej and Kochi terminals in FY28, with no tariff hike thereafter and 0% terminal growth. At 8.9x FY27E P/E and a ~4.3% dividend yield, we believe valuations are at the rock bottom. Reiterate BUY with a DCF-based TP of INR410.

Buy Star Health; target of Rs 520: Motilal Oswal,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-star-health-target-of-rs-520-motilal-oswal-2-13488938.html,"Motilal Oswal's research report on Star Health Star Health (STARHEAL) has reported lower growth than its SAHI peers, which has led to market share loss for the company in the health segment to 11.4% (YTDFY26) vs. 15.7% in FY21. However, we believe that a pickup in fresh premium growth recently should help the company sustain its market share. Its retail health performance has been lower than the industry level due to lower retention after price hikes and intensifying competition, which led to market share erosion. Its exit from group health accounts has lowered the diversification opportunities for the company. Multiple rounds of repricing done last year, along with annual price hikes expected this year, will help in managing the claims ratio. However, the company’s aging back book will keep the claims ratio elevated. STARHEAL’s expense ratios have improved consistently (30.8% in FY25 from 30.2% in FY24), despite strong new business growth. While the commission ratios will remain elevated due to rising share of fresh business (15% in FY26/FY27), operational efficiency will aid improvement in opex ratio (15.4%/14.6% in FY26/FY27). Outlook We expect a CAGR of 14%/8% in IGAAP GWP/PAT over FY25-27E, with the combined ratio improving to 98.6% in FY27E. We maintain BUY rating on the stock with a TP of INR520 (valuing the company at 29x FY27E P/E).

Pharma stocks fall up to 3% after Trump promises to significantly cut drug prices in US,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/pharma-stocks-fall-up-to-3-after-trump-promises-to-significantly-cut-drug-prices-in-us-13488561.html,"The shares of pharma companies dropped in trade on August 26 after US President Donald Trump said that he will reduce drug prices in US by a whopping ""1,400-1,500 percent"". He also reiterated his threat to slap higher tariffs on pharma imports. The Nifty Pharma index dropped more than 1.2 percent to hover around 22,082, as seen at around 11.22 am. The index has now snapped a three-session gaining streak. Trump had earlier sent letters to major drug makers, demanding them to lower drug prices in US and bring them in-line with what other nations are paying for new medicines. The letters were sent to Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer and others, demanding that Most Favored Nation (MFN) pricing be implemented by September 29. In the letter, Trump issued a 60-day ultimatum to companies to voluntarily comply to the new pricing diktat, failing which US will deploy 'every tool in our arsenal' in order to protect Americans from 'continued abusive drug pricing' practices. Companies will also have to offer certain medicines directly to patients at prices at which they are offered to third-party insurers, Trump's letters said. A 1,500 percent reduction in drug prices will make exports practically impossible to US. Pharma stocks tumbled after Trump's fresh threats. Zydus Life shares were the top loser on the index, dropping more than 3.5 percent to trade at Rs 987 apiece. Sun Pharma and Lupin shares dropped more than 2 percent each. Notably, BofA Securities has downgraded Sun Pharma shares to 'underperform' from its earlier 'neutral' rating, and cut its target price for the stock to Rs 1,570 apiece, CNBC-TV18 reported. This implies a downside potential of more than 5 percent from the previous closing price of Rs 1,656.70 apiece. The international brokerage cited potential risk to Sun Pharma's consensus earnings and its premium valuations are key reasons for the downgrade, as per the report. Aurobindo Pharma, IPCA Labs, Natco Pharma, Dr Reddy's Laboratories, Torrent Pharma and Ajanta Pharma shares fell over 1 percent each, while Cipla, Divi's Laboratories, Mankind Pharma, Laurus Labs and Glenmark Pharma were down up to 1 percent each. Bucking the trend, Granules and Abbott India shares were up 2 percent and 1 percent respectively.

"Auto, metal, real estate stocks drop up to 2% on Trump tariff worries",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/auto-metal-realty-stocks-drop-up-to-2-after-us-issues-notice-to-impose-extra-25-tariff-on-india-from-tomorrow-13488281.html,"The shares of auto, metal and real estate companies dropped in trade on August 26, after Donald Trump-led US administration issued a draft order over the implementation of additional 25 percent tariff on Indian imports, effectively from August 27 (Wednesday). The sharp drop in the share prices pushed the sectoral indices, as well as the overall market, down. Nifty Metal and Nifty Realty indices fell more than 1.2 percent and nearly 1.6 percent to hover around 9,319 and 902 respectively. Nifty Auto meanwhile was down over 0.6 percent in the morning. According to a draft notice released by US Department of Homeland Security, the additional tariffs will cover Indian products ""that are entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on August 27, 2025"". The notice cited ""threats to the United States by the Government of the Russian Federation"" as the reason for President Donald Trump's executive order dated August 6. The ties between New Delhi and Washington soured after Trump announced that he will hike the tariffs on Indian goods to 50 percent, allegedly in response to New Delhi's continued purchases of Russian oil and defence equipment. Top losers on metal index: Several metal companies have strong export exposure to the US, and will likely be impacted by Trump's tariffs. On the metal index, Adani Enterprises shares were the top loser, dropping more than 2 percent to trade at Rs 2,253 apiece. Welspun Corp, Steel Authority of India (SAIL) and Tata Steel shares fell nearly 2 percent each. Hindalco Industries, National Aluminium Company (NALCO), Hindustan Copper, NMDC and JSW Steel shares fell more than 1 percent each, while Vedanta and Hindustan Zinc shares were down nearly 1 percent. Jindal Stainless Steel shares were trading in the red with marginal losses. Top losers on realty index: While real estate companies are mostly domestic market-oriented, Trump tariffs can inflate the cost of raw materials associated with the industry, which in turn may put pressure on the margins of these companies. On the realty index, heavyweight DLF was the top loser, dropping more than 2 percent to trade at Rs 755 apiece. Macrotech Developers (Lodha), Godrej Properties, Sobha and Oberoi Realty shares fell nearly 2 percent each. Prestige Estates, Raymond, Anant Raj, Phoenix and Brigade Enterprises shares fell around 1 percent each. Top losers on auto index: Several automakers and auto-parts makers derive major portion of their revenue from exports to US. While some auto and auto parts exports are exempt from the latest tariff change, the overall impact on the industry and uncertain trade rules may have pushed the stocks down. Samvardhana Motherson and Bharat Forge shares dropped more than 2 percent, leading losses on the auto index. Balkrishna Industries, MRF and Tube Investments of India shares fell around 1.5 percent each. TVS Motor, Ashok Leyland, Bosch and Maruti Suzuki shares were down up to 1 percent.

Vodafone Idea shares slumps 9% after govt clarifies no fresh discussion on AGR relief,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/vodafone-idea-shares-slumps-6-percent-after-government-clarifies-no-fresh-discussion-on-adr-relief-13488132.html,"Shares of Vodafone Idea is witnessing a serious bout of profit booking, down over 9 percent in early trade on August 26, taking Indus Towers' shares along with it, as investors likely offloaded positions after clarification from the Telecom Ministry on the company's AGR dues. Minister of State for Communications Pemmasani Chandra Sekhar had told Moneycontrol on August 25 that there is no plan under consideration to extend further relief other than what has been already extended. “...we have recently converted a lot of their debt into equity. Government has done whatever we thought we could do and at this time we don’t have any discussion or plan to change other than what we have done,” the minister said. Any additional relief for Vodafone Idea (Vi) on its adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues will be decided collectively by the Union Cabinet, involving the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), Finance Ministry, Telecom Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia and the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), the minister added. Shares of Indus Tower are down 3.5 percent in early trade on August 26, but are flat on a YTD basis. Shares of Vodafone Idea are down over 15 percent on a YTD basis. Last week, a news report had suggested that the DoT has proposed “multiple relief options” to the PMO, including a fresh two-year moratorium on AGR payments, smaller annual instalments, and waivers on penalties and interest. Asked if the PMO had received a proposal from DoT on extending relief to the operator, Sekhar replied: “not that we know of.” On the question of survival, the minister responded, “That is not up to me to decide… every company, all the companies, are continuously reaching out for various reasons, they will also be continuously reaching. But at this time, the discussion — there is nothing that we have planned.” Vi had previously urged DoT to treat the Rs 17,213 crore (principal calculated till FY19) as final, and waive off the entire interest and penalty on AGR dues. Akshaya Moondra, the CEO of Vodafone Idea had told analysts during an investor call earlier this month that the company is entirely focusing on investing in the business. ""...whatever capital is available to the Company, the focus is not in trying to do anything with the government holding. The focus will be in using any funding and cash generation for investments, which will give the best returns for the business."" The telecom player is engaged with banks for funding, which have started moving forward. The banks are currently looking for some clarity on the AGR front, Voda Idea has said, hence the company is engaged with the government. ""In the past, we have always seen that government has been supportive. You look at 2019 deferment of spectrum instalments, 2021 Reforms Package, 2023 conversion of government dues to equity, 2025 again, conversion of government dues to equity. Generally, these actions have happened. Generally, they happen closer to the time when it is essentially needed. Our request to the government has been that let us resolve this earlier than before the deadline of March, so thatbanks get clarity and we can proceed with bank funding,"" Akshaya Moondra had told investors during the June quarter earnings call."

Bank, metal and pharma stocks were major laggards while the mid and smallcaps also mirrored weak trends in early trade. At 10:40 am, the Sensex was down 612.85 points or 0.75 percent at 81,023.06, and the Nifty was down 182.50 points or 0.73 percent at 24,785.25. About 1,028 shares advanced, 2,344 shares declined, and 133 shares were unchanged. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Earlier this month, Trump said the US would raise tariffs on Indian goods to 50 percent from 25 percent, citing New Delhi’s purchases of Russian oil. The move is intended to curb India’s energy trade with Moscow and increase pressure on Russia to halt its war in Ukraine. ""Despite muted earnings growth and challenges such as high tariffs, Indian equities have held firm, making the market the most expensive globally. While foreign investors have remained steady sellers, strong domestic institutional inflows have more than offset the outflows, keeping sentiment buoyant. With liquidity emerging as the key driver of this resilience—and flows expected to stay strong—analysts believe a sharp correction is unlikely, and elevated valuations could persist,"" V K Vijayakumar of Geojit Investments Ltd said. Among individual stocks, Sai Life Sciences slipped as much as 4 percent after private equity firm TPG Asia offloaded its entire 15.2 percent holding in the Hyderabad-based CRDMO through block deals, CNBC TV-18 reported. The sale, estimated at nearly Rs 2,810 crore, involves about 3.16 crore shares and carries a floor price of Rs 874 per share, roughly at a 3.5 percent discount from the previous close of Rs 906 per share. Titan shares slipped due to a weak market mood even as Bernstein initiated coverage with an “outperform” rating and a target price of Rs 4,200, citing the company’s strong positioning to benefit from rising formalisation and evolving consumer preferences in India. The brokerage highlighted Titan’s track record of delivering a 23 percent EPS CAGR over the past two decades and noted that the stock is trading at a five-year low valuation. Reliance Industries shares were in focus after UBS resumed coverage on the stock with a “buy” call and a price target of Rs 1,750, implying a 24 percent upside from Monday’s close. The brokerage said RIL is well placed for a re-rating on the back of its value-unlocking prospects and described the conglomerate as a key player shaping India’s digital and new energy future. Technical View With Nifty failing to display directional strength, the index now clings to its crucial support at 24,800. The broader setup between the swing high of 25,150 and swing low of 24,850 indicates limited upside and a prolonged consolidation phase. Renewed call writing at higher strikes, coupled with sustained put additions at similar levels, further validates the sideways structure. Unless the index decisively clears 25,150, upward momentum is likely to remain capped. On the downside, sustaining above 24,800 is critical to prevent deeper corrections. For now, a “sell on rise” approach appears prudent, with traders awaiting a clear breakout above 25,100 or a breakdown below 24,800 for the next directional move. Ahead of the key tariff announcement on the 27th, the market is likely to witness sideways-to-volatile sessions. HUL, Bajaj Auto, TCS and Infosys were the top gainers on the Nifty. Laggards on the index included Tata Steel, Dr Reddy's, ICICI Bank, Bharat Electronics, and Hindalco.

"Sensex, Nifty set for a weak start as Trump signals 50% tariffs; key levels to track on August 26",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sensex-nifty-set-for-a-weak-start-as-trump-signals-50-tariffs-key-levels-to-track-on-august-26-13487667.html,"Indian equities are set for a cautious start on Tuesday, August 26, after a draft notice revealed US President Donald Trump’s plan to slap 50 percent tariffs on Indian goods. At 8:15 am, the Gift Nifty was quoting at 24,916, down 71 points or 0.31 percent, signalling a weak open for the Sensex and Nifty. Earlier this month, Trump said the US would raise tariffs on Indian goods to 50 percent from 25 percent, citing New Delhi’s purchases of Russian oil. The move is intended to curb India’s energy trade with Moscow and increase pressure on Russia to halt its war in Ukraine. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Equity benchmarks Nifty 50 and Sensex recorded some gains, kicking off the holiday-truncated trading week on a positive note on Monday, August 25. Dovish signals from the U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell raised hopes of a rate cut, fuelling investor optimism across the globe. Here are the important levels to watch out for in today's session With Nifty failing to display directional strength, the index now clings to its crucial support at 24,800. The broader setup between the swing high of 25,150 and swing low of 24,850 indicates limited upside and a prolonged consolidation phase. Renewed call writing at higher strikes, coupled with sustained put additions at similar levels, further validates the sideways structure. Unless the index decisively clears 25,150, upward momentum is likely to remain capped. On the downside, sustaining above 24,800 is critical to prevent deeper corrections. For now, a “sell on rise” approach appears prudent, with traders awaiting a clear breakout above 25,100 or a breakdown below 24,800 for the next directional move. Ahead of the key tariff announcement on the 27th, the market is likely to witness sideways-to-volatile sessions. ""On the daily chart, the Nifty Bank index remains below all key moving averages except the 200-day moving average, highlighting that recovery attempts are being capped at higher levels. The index continues to hover close to the recent swing low of 54,905, which is acting as immediate support. A breakdown below this zone could drag the index further toward 54,600, which coincides with the 127.8 percent Fibonacci extension,"" Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities said. ""The broader trend remains fragile as long as the index stays below its short-term averages. Support is placed at 54,900, followed by 54,600, while resistance stays firm at 55,500–55,600. Until the index crosses above these hurdles, short-term moves may remain choppy with risks tilted toward the downside,"" he added. The India VIX settled at 11.76; however, crossing above 12.50 could lead to higher volatility in the coming sessions. The Put-Call Ratio (PCR) dipped further from 0.52 to 0.50, highlighting call-side dominance and supply pressure. At the same time, the oversold PCR also leaves room for a short-term relief pullback. The increasing PCR, or being higher than 0.7 or surpassing 1, means traders are selling more Put options than Call options, which generally indicates the firming up of a bullish sentiment in the market.

"GSK re-enters India’s oncology market with Jemperli and Zejula, unveils tiered pricing and patient support program",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/gsk-re-enters-india-s-oncology-market-with-jemperli-and-zejula-unveils-tiered-pricing-and-patient-support-program-13485879.html,"GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) has re-entered India’s oncology market with the launch of two precision therapies—Jemperli (dostarlimab) and Zejula (niraparib)—targeting advanced endometrial and ovarian cancers, respectively. The move marks GSK’s return to the cancer care segment nearly a decade after divesting its global oncology portfolio to Novartis. Speaking at a media interaction in Mumbai, Bhushan Akshikar, Managing Director of GSK India, said the company is committed to making these therapies accessible through a tiered pricing strategy and a comprehensive patient support program branded Phoenix. The tiered pricing refers to different prices for the same drug in different markets, based on factors like a country's economic status or a patient's ability to pay. “We’ve always kept the Indian patient at the core of our pricing decisions. These therapies will be comparatively priced and supported by fewer treatment cycles, which reduces overall cost burden,” Akshikar said. Akshikar declined to provide pricing details of the drugs, especially Jemperli, but said they are ""competitively"" priced compared to existing therapy. Jemperli, India’s first approved PD-1 immunotherapy for second-line treatment of mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR) advanced endometrial cancer, requires 11 infusion cycles—significantly fewer than competing immunotherapies, which typically require 17–18 cycles. PD-1 drugs are immunotherapies that help the body fight cancer by blocking the PD-1 protein, which normally prevents immune cells from attacking tumors. Jemperli competes against other PD-1s, including top sellers like Merck’s Keytruda and BMS’s Opdivo known for their broad use across many cancers and proven survival benefits. Zejula, a once-daily oral PARP inhibitor, is approved as first-line maintenance therapy for advanced ovarian cancer, regardless of biomarker status. Expanding access To further improve affordability and access, GSK’s patient support programme called Phoenix will offer financial assistance, diagnostic support, and counseling services. The company is also evaluating EMI-based payment options and biomarker testing coupons to help patients navigate the high cost of precision therapies. “This is not just about pricing—it’s about building a 360-degree support ecosystem for cancer patients,” said Dr. Shalini Menon, EVP – Medical Affairs, GSK India. “We’re addressing diagnostic gaps and ensuring timely access to treatment.” The launches are backed by global clinical data from the GARNET (Jemperli) and PRIMA (Zejula) trials, and approvals across 40+ countries. GSK is also conducting trials in India to expand indications for dostarlimab to lung, colorectal, and head-and-neck cancers. GSK’s oncology strategy is part of a broader transformation to build a specialty and super-specialty portfolio in India. “We’re starting from zero in oncology, but the potential is significant,” Akshikar said. ""I think if you open up indications one by one, each of these indications would be worth 700 crores in terms of the sheer number of patients that we have in this country."" The company has built a specialized oncology team with over 300 years of cumulative experience and is investing in clinical trials and real-world evidence generation to accelerate future launches. Rising gynaecological cancers Endometrial cancer is a malignancy arising out of the endometrium, the inner lining of the uterus. Nearly a fourth of endometrial cancer patients in India are at an advanced stage. At this stage, chemotherapy remains a standard treatment but it is often associated with toxicity and poor long-term outcomes. According to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) – National Cancer Registry Programme (NCRP), the estimated annual incidence in India is around 19,000 to 20,000 new cases per year for Endometrial cancer and 48,000 new cases annually for ovarian cancer. Endometrial and ovarian cancers are among the top three gynaecological cancers in India. By 2045, the incidence of endometrial and ovarian cancer in India is projected to increase by 78% and 69% respectively."

The index pulled back from the highs of the day, and at close, the Sensex closed up 329.06 points or 0.40 percent at 81,635.91, while the Nifty 50 was up 97.65 points or 0.39 percent at 24,967.75.

Click to View More Outlook for August 26 Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets started the week on a positive note, gaining nearly half a percent on the back of favorable global cues. After an initial uptick, the Nifty slipped in early trade but recovered as strong buying in IT majors and resilience in heavyweights across other sectors lifted the index higher. As a result, the Nifty 50 ended near 24,967.75, up around 0.4%. In contrast, the broader markets remained subdued, closing almost flat, reflecting a cautious undertone. Investor sentiment was buoyed by easing global rate concerns, with comments from the U.S. Federal Reserve hinting at a possible rate cut next month, boosting risk appetite across emerging markets. On the domestic front, steady institutional inflows and softening crude oil prices provided additional support. From a technical perspective, the Nifty faces immediate resistance at the 25,150 level; a breakout above this could open the door for further gains. Traders should closely track IT, metals, and realty stocks, while financials are likely to set the tone for the next session. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The Indian equities remained strong, tracking global cues, as the dovish speech by Fed Chair Jerome Powell boosted risk-on sentiment. However, the Nifty fell short of the 25,000 mark, closing slightly below it. The sentiment remains positive as long as the index holds above 24,800. In the near term, particularly on Tuesday, the Indian market may trade sideways as traders await the final verdict on Trump’s additional 25% tariff decision on 27th August. The Nifty is expected to remain within the range of 24,800–25,150 before any decisive directional move. Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities After showing sharp weakness on Friday, Nifty bounced back smartly on Monday and closed the day with decent gains of 97 points. After opening with a positive note, the market continued to surge higher gradually for better part of the session. There was a consolidation movement towards the end and Nifty closed the day off the highs. A small positive candle was formed on the daily chart with minor upper and lower shadow (Inside day type candle pattern). This market action indicates an absence of follow-through selling in the market after a sharp weakness of Friday. This is positive indication. The opening upside gap of 18th Aug remains unfilled after six sessions of its formation. This bullish breakaway gap indicates more upside for the Nifty in the near term. Hence, the next upside target to be watched around 25200-25300 in the near term. Immediate support is placed at 24800.

IndusInd Bank shares jump 2% after CRISIL reaffirms AA+ rating on lender's long-term debt instruments,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/indusind-bank-shares-jump-2-after-crisil-reaffirms-aa-rating-on-lender-s-long-term-debt-instruments-13485858.html,"The shares of IndusInd Bank jumped nearly 2 percent on August 25 after CRISIL Ratings reaffirmed its 'AA+' rating on the private lender's long term debt instruments. The rise in the share price comes despite the stock being scheduled to exit the Nifty 50 index as part of the latest rejig. In a note dated August 23, CRISIL Ratings reaffirmed the 'AA+' rating on the long term debt instruments, while assigning a 'Negative' outlook. It removed its rating on the long-term debt instruments of IndusInd Bank from 'Rating Watch with Negative Implications'. CRISIL also reaffirmed its 'A1+' rating on the short-term debt instruments of the company. The ratings agency had placed the long term rating of IndusInd's debt instruments on 'Watch Negative' on May 7, after ""the resignation of top two managerial personnel as well as disclosure of a review being conducted on the bank’s microfinance business by an internal audit department to examine few concerns, brought to attention during finalisation of accounts"", it said. The then CEO Sumant Kathpalia and deputy CEO Arun Khurana resigned from their respective roles in April due to discrepancies in the bank's derivatives portfolio. IndusInd Bank had earlier announced that there were certain accounting lapses in the derivative portfolio which could have a negative impact of 2.35 percent of the bank’s net worth, as of December 2024. Earlier in August, IndusInd Bank announced the appointment of Rajiv Anand as its new Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer. In a press release, the lender announced today that Anand has taken charge at the helm of the company effectively from today. ""The watch resolution takes into account clarity with respect to the appointment of the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and the expectation of no further negative impact in the financial statements on account of lapses in internal financial controls,"" CRISIL said. ""The 'Negative' outlook reflects the modest overall profitability of the bank. The return on assets (RoA) is likely to remain modest over the next few quarters amidst asset quality challenges particularly in the micro loan segment on account of industry wide stress. Improvement in the profitability metrics by the end of fiscal 2026 and sustenance of the same will be critical,"" CRISIL added, while noting that the ratings reflect healthy capitalisation of the bank, with a high core equity ratio and adequate pre-provisioning profitability. The National Stock Exchange (NSE) on August 22 announced changes to its benchmark Nifty 50 index. As part of the semi-annual reshuffle, IndusInd Bank and Hero MotoCorp will be dropped, while Max Healthcare Institute and InterGlobe Aviation, the parent company of IndiGo, will be added to the benchmark index from September 30 onwards, the exchange said. The NSE reviews the composition of the Nifty 50 twice a year, based on the average free-float market capitalisation of stocks during the six months ending January 31 and July 31. The changes take effect in March and September. IndusInd Bank in July reported a 68 percent decline in standalone net profit at Rs 684 crore for the first quarter of FY26, hurt by a decline in loans and a rise in provisions for potential bad loans. On a consolidated basis, net profit fell 72 percent year-over-year to Rs 604 crore. The lender's net interest income fell 14 percent year-on-year to Rs 4,640 crore in Q1FY26. According to Moneycontrol's poll, IndusInd Bank's net interest income (NII) was seen at Rs 4,279 crore in Q1FY26 and profit was pegged at Rs 559 crore in Q1FY26. IndusInd Bank shares closed at Rs 772 apiece on August 25. The stock has fallen more than 6 percent in the past one month, and over 25 percent in the past six months. It currently has a P/E ratio of 58.70. Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Vodafone Idea shares jump up to 16% in two sessions after report says PMO to take call on AGR relief,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/vodafone-idea-shares-jump-16-in-two-sessions-after-report-says-pmo-to-take-call-on-agr-relief-13485251.html,"The shares of Vodafone Idea (Vi) jumped nearly 7.5 percent to day's high on August 25, extending significant gains for the second consecutive session after a report by Mint said that the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) is set to take a call on a relief proposal for the telecom major. The shares of the company gained 16 percent in the two consecutive trading sessions to hit an intraday high of Rs 7.60 apiece on Monday. The stock later pared some gains to close at Rs 7.40 apiece, marking a rise of nearly 5 percent from the previous closing price. PMO had received an informal note from the Department of Telecommunication (DoT), proposing multiple relief options for the debt-ridden telecom company, Mint reported last week citing people familiar with the matter. These options include another two-year pause on paying the statutory dues under moratorium currently. The PMO will take the decision on whether these relief measures are to be extended, said the Mint report cited a source as saying. DoT has also proposed to give Vodafone Idea more time to repay dues, smaller annual payouts, and a waiver on penalties and interest penalties on AGR payment, the report added. Moneycontrol couldn't independently verify the report. Vodafone Idea has been struggling with dues, owing about Rs 83,400 crore in adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues, with annual payments of nearly Rs 18,000 crore scheduled from March 2025. Its overall dues to the government stand at around Rs 2 trillion including penalty and interest, Mint said. The debt-laden operator has repeatedly warned it cannot survive without funding support, as banks remain wary of lending given its financial stress. Vi employs over 18,000 people and has nearly 198 million subscribers. Telecom service provider Vodafone Idea (Vi) is exploring non-bank avenues to fund its capital expenditure plans, as negotiations with lenders remain stalled due to uncertainty over adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues, outgoing CEO Akshaya Moondra said on August 18 during the June quarter earnings call. Vi has also formally urged the government to settle the AGR matter ahead of the March 2026 deadline, which Moondra said would help reassure banks and unlock financing support. ""Given the fact that we are keen on maintaining a continuity of our capex, which has been going on since last year, we are looking at non-banking sources of funding, also not the full amount of Rs 25,000 crore that we have talked about, but a lesser amount so that we can continue with the capex cycle,"" Moondra said. Should you buy, sell or hold? Motilal Oswal recommended a 'Sell' rating for the stock, with a target price of Rs 6 per share. This implies a downside potential of more than 8 percent from the previous closing price of Rs 6.55 per share. “We cut our FY27-28E revenue and EBITDA estimates by ~4-5% each, driven by higher subscriber declines. We reiterate our SELL rating on Vi with a revised TP of INR6, based on DCF implied ~12.5x Sep’27E EV/EBITDA,” the domestic brokerage said. ICICI Securities kept a 'Hold' rating for the stock, with a target price of Rs 7 per share. This implies an upside potential of nearly 7 percent from the previous closing price. ""VIL has funding to incur elevated capex only till Q2FY26; its future capex is dependent on closing the funding arrangement which has been in the process for a while. VIL is also hopeful of a resolution on AGR matter before its first EMI due in Mar’26, remains critical for establishing its going concern status,"" the brokerage noted.

Ola Electric Mobility shares surge 5% on buzz over Niti Aayog meet to push EV adoption,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/ola-electric-mobility-shares-surge-5-on-buzz-over-niti-aayog-meet-to-push-ev-adoption-13484997.html,"Shares of Ola Electric Mobility gained 5 percent on Monday, touching an intraday high of Rs 49.40 after reports that the government’s policy think-tank Niti Aayog has convened a meeting with leading two-wheeler makers to fast-track the electrification of motorcycles. Executives from Hero MotoCorp, Bajaj Auto, TVS Motor, Ola Electric, Ather Energy and Revolt are expected to join the deliberations, a Hindu Businessline report stated. The discussions will focus on measures to drive adoption of electric motorcycles, a segment that makes up two-thirds of India’s two-wheeler sales. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Government estimates suggest electric scooters could account for as much as 80 percent of sales by 2030, but motorcycles may still only reach 10 percent, dragging overall two-wheeler electrification to around 36 percent—well short of policy ambitions. Officials are expected to explore strategies such as scaling up production, reducing upfront costs, battery-swapping models and innovative financing options to make EV motorcycles more affordable and competitive, the report added. The meeting comes at a time when Ola Electric founder Bhavish Aggarwal has reiterated the company’s aim of cornering 25–30 percent share of the domestic two-wheeler EV market, backed by vertical integration and new launches. “Our mojo is still there,” Aggarwal said last week, adding that profitability would remain high as volumes scale. Investor sentiment has also been supported in recent sessions by expectations of a possible GST cut on entry-level two-wheelers, compact cars and hybrids. At about 1:15 pm, shares of the company were up at Rs 48.35, higher by 2.5 percent from the last close on the NSE. Ola Electric Mobility shares are up nearly 20 percent over the last week.

Shreeji Shipping shares to make market debut tomorrow: GMP signals decent listing; what to expect?,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/shreeji-shipping-shares-to-make-market-debut-tomorrow-gmp-signals-decent-listing-what-to-expect-13484908.html,"The shares of Shreeji Shipping Global are set to make their market debut tomorrow (August 26). The Rs 411-crore IPO saw strong investor interest during its three days of public bidding, being subscribed over 58 times between August 19 and August 21. The maiden public issue of the Gujarat-based shipping and logistic solution company entirely comprised a fresh issue of shares at a price band of Rs 240-252 per share. Investors could bid for a minimum of 58 shares, requiring an investment of Rs 14,616 at the upper price band, and in multiples thereafter. Shreeji Shipping Global IPO GMP: Ahead of listing, the unlisted shares of the company were trading with a grey market premium (GMP) of nearly 13.5 percent over the IPO price at Rs 286 apiece, according to data on Investorgain. This is higher than the 12 percent GMP cited by the site on the day of allotments. However, it is lower than the 15 percent cited on its last day of public bidding. According to IPO Watch, the unlisted shares of the company were trading with 11.11 percent GMP over the IPO price in the grey market. Shreeji Shipping Global IPO: What to expect? The strong subscription numbers for Shreeji Shipping Global IPO reflects overwhelming investor appetite, said Harshal Dasani, Business Head, INVasset PMS. ""This enthusiasm came despite a moderation in topline performance, as revenue declined from Rs 736 crore in FY24 to Rs 610 crore in FY25. Profitability, however, showed resilience with a 13 percent year-on-year rise in net profit to Rs 141 crore, aided by tighter cost controls and improved operational efficiency. The company's return ratios remain enviable, with return on equity near 44 percent and return on capital employed above 32 percent, although valuation multiples—around 29 times earnings and over five times book—sit well above sector norms,"" he added. Dasani noted that the dry-bulk segment remains highly exposed to global trade volatility and freight cycles, with concentration risk in customer exposure. ""The fundamentals suggest a well-run company with strong profitability metrics, but the stretched valuations mean near-term listing gains could be offset by future earnings execution. For investors, the stock may be better suited as a tactical play on listing momentum, while long-term exposure requires careful monitoring of industry cycles,"" he further said. Narendra Solanki, Head of Fundamental Research, Investment Services, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers, advised investors to 'hold' the issue for the long term, according to their risk appetite. ""At the upper price band company is valuing at P/E of 28.5x to its FY25 earnings, with EV/EBITDA of 21.4x and market cap of ₹ 41,055 million post issue of equity shares,"" he said.

Accumulate PI Industries; target of Rs 4330: Deven Choksey,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/accumulate-pi-industries-target-of-rs-4330-deven-choksey-13484752.html,"Deven Choksey's research report on PI Industries Consolidated revenue for the quarter came in at INR 19,005 Mn. down 8.1% YoY (+6.3% QoQ), stood sharply below our estimates, due to subdued growth in the exports segment, partially offset by mid-single digit growth in the domestic segment. EBITDA stood at INR 5,191 Mn., down 11.0% YoY (+13.9% QoQ), stood sharply below our estimates, led by a sharp miss in revenue and higher-than-expected employee expense. Adjusted net profit declined by 10.9% YoY (+21.0% QoQ) to INR 4,000 Mn., sharply below our estimates, led by poor operational performance. Gross Profit margin expanded by 565bps YoY (+236bps QoQ) to 57.4%, led by a favorable shift in product mix towards higher-margin molecules, coupled with cost optimization efforts and stronger momentum in margin-accretive segments. EBITDA margin contracted by 88bps YoY (+182bps QoQ) to 27.3%, driven by higher development spend observed in pharma segment, incremental overheads from growth initiatives, and negative operating leverage, partially offset by improvement witnessed in gross margins. Outlook We have rolled forward our valuation to Jun’27 estimates. We value PI Industries at 32.0x Jun’27 EPS (near to its 10-year Avg. NTM P/E), implying a target price of INR 4,330. PI Industries is currently trading at 34.0x/29.3x of our FY26E/FY27E EPS estimates. We reiterate our “ACCUMULATE” rating on the stock as we see near-term pressures as transient, with H2FY26E recovery led by exports and new launches.

"Duty-free cotton offers breather to textile stocks, but US tariff cloud continues to loom",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/duty-free-cotton-offers-breather-to-textile-stocks-but-us-tariff-cloud-continues-to-loom-13484442.html,"Stocks such as Vardhman Textiles, Ambika Cotton Mills, Gokaldas Exports and Indo Count Industries enjoyed a short-lived buzz as India removed duties on raw cotton imports till September 30 in a signal to the US. While analysts believe that the temporary relief could bring respite to their tight margins over the near term as the government aims to cool domestic prices, the medium-term trajectory hinges on how these companies navigate the uncertainty arising from the tariffs levied by the US, and diversify into newer markets. From August 27, India will face 50 percent tariffs from the US administration. A planned visit by US trade negotiators to New Delhi from August 25-29 has been called off, delaying talks on a proposed bilateral trade agreement and dampening hopes of relief from an additional 25 percent US levy starting August 27. Sentiment positive but gaps remain Independent analyst Ambareesh Baliga agreed that the move is sentimentally positive for cotton stocks that have been wealth destroyers this year. Lower input costs will make the supply chain more competitive, benefiting the entire textile value chain, including yarn, fabric, garments and made-ups, he said. However, Baliga warned that for US-bound exports of apparel and home textiles, the gap would remain significant compared to competing countries such as Bangladesh and Vietnam unless tariffs are reduced to 25 percent. Market expert Ajay Bagga agreed, saying that while the 11 percent duty waiver on raw cotton is a helpful short-term relief for the textile industry, it’s not enough on its own. He believes that the government should roll out a broader support package that includes easier loan access, export incentives and measures to reduce raw material costs. Such steps would give the entire textile value chain, from yarn to garments, the strength to handle challenges like high US tariffs and intense global competition. Indian exports previously faced duties of 0-5 percent, with some textiles taxed at between 9 and 13 percent before tariffs were raised under the Trump administration. Now, the 50 percent tariff is not a standalone levy, it is in addition to the standard US import duty. Reports suggested total duties on Indian textiles and apparel exports to the US will now hit alarming levels across various categories: carpets at 52.9 percent, knitted garments at 63.9 percent, woven garments at 60.3 percent, and textiles and made-ups at 59 percent. This underscores how uncompetitive Indian products will become under the new regime, effectively pricing them out of the US market. Competing nations have the edge Moreover, it makes Indian garment exporters uncompetitive against rivals in Bangladesh and Vietnam, where US duties are around 20 percent, and China, at 30 percent. Most of these companies are heavily dependent on the US. Gokaldas Exports derives around 70 percent of its revenue from the North American country. Welspun Living earns about 65 percent of its revenue from the US, where it is a leading exporter of towels and bed linen. Indo Count Industries also derives nearly 70 percent of its sales from exports, with the US as its dominant market. Unless these players diversify beyond the US, maintaining profitability in the coming quarters will be challenging, experts warned. Diversification and margin play On its earnings call, Gokaldas Exports said the second half of the fiscal looks even more challenging as US brands have begun raising end-retail prices, which could hit demand and drive tougher negotiations on pricing. The company, however, plans to diversify its business geographically to reduce dependence on a single market. Notably, exports to the EU rose to 13.4 percent in Q1FY26 from 11.6 percent in Q4FY25. Vardhman Textiles, on the other hand, expects margins to improve as duty-free cotton imports kick in. The company has avoided absorbing any US tariff impact in its yarn business so far, and since 30-35 percent of its exports go to Bangladesh, no significant business disruption has been seen. So far this year, shares of Vardhman Textiles, Ambika Cotton Mills, Gokaldas Exports and Indo Count Industries have dropped up to 30 percent. According to Baliga, much of the tariff impact is already priced in, but the sector’s fortunes now hinge on whether the US administration rolls back the duties imposed on India, something that could ease margin stress for these textile players.

KPIT among top engineering R&D plays as Motilal initiates coverage: Check out the rationale,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/kpit-among-top-engineering-r-d-plays-as-motilal-initiates-coverage-check-out-the-rationale-13484757.html,"Despite a recent slowdown in capex by western car makers, the long-term outlook remains robust, Motilal Oswal said in a note, as global mobility is accelerating the role of software in vehicles prompting it to initiate coverage on automotive engineering R&D (ER&D) players KPIT Tech, Tata Technologies and Tata Elxsi. The note said ER&D specialists with 'domain depth, co-development, and global delivery' are well-poised to benefit from the tailwinds. ""Despite the recent moderation in capex cycles among Western OEMs, the long-term outlook remains robust. Asian OEMs are pivoting toward hybrids and localized strategies, while global players are recognizing software as the key competitive frontier,"" the note said. Motilal Oswal added that several Asian OEMs are 'pivoting' toward hybrids and more localised strategies, and global players are betting on software as the next 'competitive frontier'. All this, MOSL said, makes specialized engineering service players an attract longer term bets. MOSL note said the shift is mobility has been towards CASE (connected, autonomous, shared, electric), which is accelerating the role of software in vehicles. As a result, OEMs are moving towards a centralized domain and preparing for software-defined vehicles (SDVs). Also, regulations world over are nudging automakers towards greener mobility, leading to electric powertrains. For MOSL, KPIT Technologies is a Buy with a target of Rs 1,600 per share, valued at 40x FY27E EPS, reflecting its strength in SDV and 'middleware' capabilities. ""The company’s core strengths lie in embedded software development, E/E (Electrical/Electronic) architecture, and middleware consulting, accounting for over 80% of its revenue,"" Motilal Oswal said. The note also initiated coverage on Tata Tech and Tata Elexi, though with a Sell rating. For Tata Elxsi, there is a near-term growth headwind in Europe, along with a less favourable risk–reward at current valuation, said MOSL. Tata Tech is at a discount to KPIT owing to its lower margin profile due to 'higher mechanical exposure, client concentration risks, and modest growth visibility.'

"JK Paper, TNPL, other paper stocks rise up to 17% as Centre sets minimum price on import of packaging material",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/jk-paper-tnpl-other-paper-stocks-rise-up-to-17-as-centre-sets-minimum-price-on-import-of-packaging-material-13484163.html,"Shares of paper companies surged up to 17 percent in early trade on August 25 after the government imposed a Minimum Import Price (MIP) on Virgin Multi-layer Paper Board (VMPB), a move aimed at curbing cheaper imports. Tamilnadu Newsprint and Papers Ltd (TNPL) led the rally, building on early gains to climb by 17 percent to an intraday high of Rs 179.90 on the NSE after two consecutive sessions of decline. JK Paper also advanced sharply, rising 15 percent after four days of losses. West Coast Paper Mills jumped 13.71 percent, while Orient Paper and Industries rose 8.16 percent. Malu Paper Mills and Andhra Paper also gained up to 12 percent in early trade. The Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), in a notification, had said that the MIP will remain in force till March 31, 2026. By fixing a floor price for imports, Centre has effectively made cheap foreign supplies costlier, providing relief to domestic producers. Paper companies in India have long complained of competition from low-priced imports, particularly from Indonesia and China. The Indian Paper Manufacturers Association had in June sought an anti-dumping probe against imports of VMPB from Indonesia. Virgin Multi-layer Paper Board is widely used in packaging for pharmaceuticals, FMCG, food and beverages, electronics, cosmetics, liquor, and also in publishing. By fixing a minimum import price, the government has made cheap imports costlier. This protects local companies, as importers either have to pay more for imported paper board or buy from Indian producers. As a result, domestic demand is expected to shift towards Indian paper companies.

Nazara Technologies shares tumbled over 11 percent to trade at Rs 1,026.70 apiece in the morning. Notably, this is the lowest level seen by the stock in over three months. The gaming stock has so far fallen over 26 percent in the past five days, and currently has a P/E ratio of nearly 95. Delta Corp shares meanwhile dropped around 2 percent to trade at Rs 86.29 apiece. The stock has dropped nearly 6 percent in the past six months, and is down around 23 percent in 2025 so far. The new law prohibits online money games where a user makes a deposit, directly or indirectly, with the expectation of earning winnings on that deposit. Analysts expect that the immediate fallout of the new law would be job losses, the collapse of start-ups, and a sharp drop in foreign and domestic investment. The move threatens to wipe out around 2 lakh jobs, Rs 25,000 crore in foreign direct investment, and Rs 20,000 crore in tax revenues, they say. The move is set to give a blow to the country's $3.8 billion gaming industry that has drawn the attention of global investors and fostered fantasy sports apps like Dream11, Games24X7 and Mobile Premier League. The law includes an imprisonment of up to three years and/or a fine of up to Rs 1 crore. It also includes a provision where repeated offences could attract 3-5 years imprisonment and fines up to Rs 2 crore. The proposed legislation also recommends a regulator for e-sports, educational platforms, and social games. Minister for Electronics and Information Technology Ashwini Vaishnaw while tabling the bill in Rajya Sabha termed online money games as a 'public health risk"". ""There are addiction and withdrawal symptoms. Many families have been destroyed,"" Vaishnaw said. The minister also said that around 45 crore people have been affected, and around Rs 20,000 crore have been lost because of online money games. Nazara Tech said on August 22 its associate firm, Moonshine Technologies, which operates PokerBaazi and other card-based platforms, has ceased offering online games played with money. Ananay Jain, Partner, Grant Thornton Bharat said that the blanket restrictions on certain real-money games may stifle segments of the gaming market that were previously generating significant revenue, particularly in mobile gaming and tournament-based platforms. ""Smaller start-ups and emerging developers may face compliance burdens and financial strain due to penalties and regulatory requirements."" Several real-money gaming (RMG) companies are likely to file writ petitions, as early as possible this week, in 2-3 high courts of the country against the contentious online-gaming Act passed by the Parliament on Thursday, three people directly aware of the matter told Moneycontrol. Sources say, the companies are having consultations currently to decide whether to file petitions individually or through federations, in order to seek a stay on the implementation of the 'Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Bill, 2025'.
