Hold Tata Elxsi; target of Rs 5500: Prabhudas Lilladher,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/hold-tata-elxsi-target-of-rs-5500-prabhudas-lilladher-13772327.html,"Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Tata Elxsi The revenue performance (+3.2% QoQ CC) exceeded our estimates (+2.5% QoQ CC), aided by robust growth in Transportation vertical (+7.3% QoQ CC). The sharp uptick in Transportation is a combination of ramp up in anchor account along with a spending recovery in strategic top accounts, ex-top 10 accounts declined 7.5% in USD. The OEMs’ participation is inclined towards costs savings instead of focusing on the innovation and growth areas. The M&C and H&L performance was discouraging and reported third consecutive quarters of decline. We believe the underlying spending pattern within M&C and H&L is sporadic, attributed to the structural issues, and would require couple of more quarters to achieve a steady state. The management was confident of reviving growth within these two verticals on the back of new logo additions and few closures that concluded in Q3. On margin, it exceeded our estimate by 140bps QoQ. At the current margin, the utilization stood at ~75%, it aspires to achieve 85% utilization with a combination of deploying automation and AI. Additionally, we believe the decoupling of revenue growth and talent hiring would provide incremental margins levers. We are revising our margins up by 70bps/40bps/20bps for FY26E/FY27E/FY28E due to beat in Q3. Outlook We expect CC revenue to decline by 4.8% (-5.1% QoQ earlier) in FY26E and grow by 9.8%/11.6% YoY in FY27E/FY28E. We are assigning 33x PE to FY28 EPS, translating a TP of 5,500.

Buy Just Dial; target of Rs 968: ICICI Direct,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-just-dial-target-of-rs-968-icici-direct-13772267.html,"ICICI Direct's research report on Just Dial Just Dial reported 6.4% YoY revenue growth in Q3FY26, with EBITDA margin expanding 102bps YoY driven by lower employee costs following Q2FY26’s headcount reductions. Paid campaign net additions rebounded to 1.6mn (up 22.6% YoY), likely reflecting the impact of ad spends in Q3. Web segment traffic fell 6.7% QoQ/3.5% YoY. Sustained traction in net additions in the next 2–3 quarters and its eventual translation into collections may be a key monitorable. Q3 collections were INR 3bn (up 8% YoY), suggesting improvement while cash balance grew to INR 57bn. However, the key question on the stock – cash distribution to shareholders – remains unanswered. Outlook Despite no visibility on cash redistribution to shareholders, we think the stock’s recent price correction provides a good opportunity to enter. Upgrade to BUY; TP unchanged at INR 968 (6x FY27E EV/EBITDA /implied 5x FY28E EV/EBITDA).

Did Kotak Mahindra Bank stock really crash 80 percent today? Here’s why investors must not worry,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/did-kotak-mahindra-bank-stock-really-crash-80-percent-today-here-s-why-investors-must-not-worry-13772245.html,"Shares of Kotak Mahindra Bank appeared to plunge more than 80 percent on Wednesday, January 14. However, the dramatic fall is entirely optical and linked to the bank’s 5:1 stock split, which came into effect today. Kotak Mahindra Bank shares are trading ex-split today, with the face value reduced to Re 1 per share from Rs 5. As part of the corporate action, one existing equity share has been sub-divided into five equity shares, with the stock price adjusting proportionately. Why Kotak Mahindra Bank stock shows 80 percent fall, and where it really stands On platforms that do not automatically adjust historical prices for the split, the stock appears to be down nearly 80 percent. This is simply the mathematical adjustment from the pre-split price to the post-split price, not a sell-off. Once adjusted for the split, Kotak Mahindra Bank stock was trading around Rs 419-420, down about 1.6 percent on the day. On a split-adjusted basis, Kotak Mahindra Bank shares are trading comfortably within their recent range, with a 52-week low of about Rs 346 and a high near Rs 460. The bank’s market capitalisation, adjusted for the split, is around Rs 83,500 crore, and the stock is up over 9 percent over the past one year. What happens to investors’ shares in their demat accounts For shareholders, the split does not change the value of their investment. Instead, it changes the number of shares held and the price per share. If an investor held 1 share of Kotak Mahindra Bank before the split, that holding automatically becomes 5 shares in the demat account after the record date. Correspondingly, the share price adjusts to roughly one-fifth of the earlier level. The total investment value remains the same, barring normal market fluctuations. No action is required from investors. The additional shares are credited automatically to demat accounts, and the revised quantity becomes visible once the corporate action is fully processed by the depositories. The split is primarily aimed at improving liquidity and affordability, making the stock more accessible to a wider set of retail investors without altering fundamentals. Kotak Mahindra Bank’s stock split history This is not the first time the lender has split its shares: January 14, 2026: Face value reduced from Rs 5 to Re 1 (5:1 split)September 13, 2010: Face value reduced from Rs 10 to Rs 5 (2:1 split) In both instances, the objective was to enhance trading liquidity and broaden investor participation, without impacting the underlying valuation. Kotak Mahindra Bank stock call: ‘Buy’ Separately, brokerage commentary on Kotak Mahindra Bank shares continues to be driven by medium-term fundamentals rather than today’s corporate action. An HDFC Securities institutional research report this week maintained a constructive view on the lender’s stock. The report pointed to steady growth prospects, improving deposit quality, and resilient profitability, even as the bank navigates trade-offs between growth, margins, and asset quality. The brokerage reiterated a ‘Buy’ stance with a sum-of-the-parts target price of Rs 2,500 (pre-split), reflecting confidence in the franchise despite sector-wide challenges.

"Asian shares post small gain, Yen weakens past 159",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/asian-shares-post-small-gain-yen-weakens-past-159-13771713.html,"Asian shares posted a modest gain at the open, while Japanese equities extended their record-breaking run fueled by a weaker yen. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average advanced 0.9%, with the Japanese currency slipping past the 159-per-dollar level to the weakest since July 2024. Stocks in the country have jumped and the currency fallen amid reports of a snap election. Shares in South Korea edged up, having posted a gain on every trading day of 2026. In Tuesday’s US session, the S&P 500 fell from an all-time high, as JPMorgan Chase & Co. led a slide in lenders after its investment-banking fees missed guidance. US benchmarks dropped after December inflation data did little to dent expectations that the Federal Reserve will pause interest-rate cuts. Traders are going into Wednesday awaiting a possible US Supreme Court ruling on President Donald Trump’s global tariffs that were announced in April. Meanwhile, the cooler-than-expected US consumer price index reading reinforced bond traders’ expectations that the Fed will wait until mid-year to cut rates. Even after Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his board lowered the benchmark three times last year, money markets have continued to project the next reduction only in mid-2026. “The initial excitement sparked by a cooler-than-anticipated core CPI was short-lived,” said Jose Torres at Interactive Brokers. “The reversal was influenced, in part, by the report’s failure to pull forward the next expected rate reduction from June to April, as fixed-income watchers project Powell’s December cut will be his last at the helm.” Following JPMorgan’s results Tuesday, earnings from megabank rivals Bank of America Corp., Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley are slated for Wednesday and Thursday. The group is expected to post its second-highest annual profit ever, boosted by Trump’s policy changes. Traders also are mindful of the potential for a US Supreme Court ruling Wednesday on tariffs the White House has been enforcing. An adverse ruling could draw a negative market reaction, even as the administration has alternative legal avenues for most of the levies. Elsewhere, Brent crude notched its biggest four-day gain since June as Trump ramped up rhetoric on Iran, while silver also extended its recent rally to cap its best three-day streak on record. Attention in Asia will once again be on Japan, where Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s reported plan for a snap election fueled a rally in stocks while pushing down bonds and driving the yen deeper into the intervention-risk zone. Japanese five-year yields rose to 1.615%, the highest since the tenor’s 2000 debut. Success at the polls for Takaichi, who ascended to the premiership in October, would provide a mandate for her to continue hawkish diplomacy and pro-stimulus policies. Back to the US inflation data, the December core CPI, excluding the often volatile food and energy categories, increased 0.2% from November. On an annual basis, it advanced 2.6%, matching a four-year low. The reading is perhaps a more convincing sign that inflation is on a downward path, since a number of caveats in November’s report contributed to a significant pullback in the annual core CPI. “Given the quirks of November’s dual-month report, it’s surprising not to see more numerous large month-over-month readjustments,” said Stephen Kates at Bankrate. “Consumers can breathe a sigh of relief that we didn’t snap back to the 3% annual inflation rate. Although today’s reading doesn’t demonstrate additional progress for inflation, it doesn’t take a step backwards either.”"
"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade TVS Motor, Union Bank of India, Dredging Corporation, Tech Mahindra, ICICI Bank, and others on January 14?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-tvs-motor-union-bank-of-india-dredging-corporation-tech-mahindra-icici-bank-and-others-on-january-14-13771690.html,"The benchmark indices gave up some of the previous day’s gains, with the Nifty 50 declining 0.22 percent on January 13. Market breadth was moderately weak, with about 1,491 shares declining against 1,370 advancing shares on the NSE. The market may see consolidation as long as it trades below the midline of the Bollinger Bands. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Amol Athawale, VP Technical Research at Kotak Securities TVS Motor Company | CMP: Rs 3,755.4 After declining from higher levels, TVS Motor rebounded from its retracement zone and witnessed a robust recovery. Additionally, on the intraday charts, the stock has given a breakout from its sloping trendline. The upward move in the stock suggests a new leg of a bullish trend from current levels. For the next few trading sessions, Rs 3,620 could be the trend-decider level for bulls. If the stock sustains above this level, a further uptrend towards Rs 4,010 can be expected. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 4,010 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,620 Jindal Steel | CMP: Rs 1,010.8 After a remarkable up move on the daily chart, Jindal Steel witnessed profit booking at higher levels. Following the recent sell-off, the downward momentum in the stock has stalled. Moreover, the stock has found support near its demand zone. This formation suggests a revival of the uptrend from current levels in the near future. For positional traders, Rs 980 would be the decisive level. If the stock trades above this level, the uptrend is likely to continue towards Rs 1,080. However, if it closes below Rs 980, traders may prefer to exit long positions. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,080 Stop-Loss: Rs 980 Union Bank of India | CMP: Rs 166.19 Following its strong up move and a brief consolidation over the last few sessions, Union Bank of India is gaining further traction for a fresh up move. The chart structure indicates a bullish continuation pattern, which is likely to persist in the near term. As long as the stock trades above Rs 161, the bullish bias is likely to continue, with an upside target of Rs 178. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 178 Stop-Loss: Rs 161 Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO at Waves Strategy Advisors Dredging Corporation of India | CMP: Rs 1,105 On the daily chart, Dredging Corporation of India has been trading in a broad consolidation range of Rs 892–1,071 over the past few weeks, indicating an accumulation phase. In the previous session, the stock finally gave a range breakout and managed to close above the range at Rs 1,105. This move was supported by a strong rise in volumes, adding credibility to the breakout. Additionally, the MACD has witnessed a bullish crossover for the first time since December 2025, which is a positive sign. For now, any dips towards Rs 1,070–1,075 can be considered a buying opportunity for an upside move towards Rs 1,150. On the downside, the Rs 1,020 level is expected to act as a crucial support. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,150 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,020 Tech Mahindra | CMP: 1,614.8 On the daily chart, Tech Mahindra has been moving within a larger triangle pattern since the beginning of December 2024 and is now trading close to the trendline resistance. At the start of this week, the stock found support at the 50-day EMA (Exponential Moving Average) and witnessed a sharp rebound, forming higher highs and higher lows, which signals an improving price structure. For now, a break above Rs 1,635 can confirm a breakout from the triangle pattern, potentially resulting in a fresh rally towards Rs 1,750–1,800, as long as the EMA support near Rs 1,558 remains protected on the downside. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,750, Rs 1,800 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,558 ICICI Bank | CMP: Rs 1,437 At the start of the month, ICICI Bank confirmed a breakout from a double-bottom pattern and has successfully retested the breakout zone. The stock is now trading near its prior swing high of Rs 1,442, indicating sustained strength. Over the past two sessions, prices have consistently protected the previous day’s low on a closing basis, which is a positive sign. Additionally, the Know Sure Thing (KST) indicator has already given a bullish crossover and is now trading above the zero line, suggesting that positive momentum is likely to continue. A decisive break above the Rs 1,442 level is required for bullish momentum to extend, which could push prices higher towards Rs 1,540, while Rs 1,390 is expected to act as the nearest support. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,540 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,390"

Zydus Lifesciences' unit Sentynl wins USFDA nod for rare pediatric disease therapy,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/zydus-lifesciences-unit-sentynl-wins-usfda-nod-for-rare-pediatric-menkes-disease-therapy-13771070.html,"Sentynl Therapeutics, a U.S.-based subsidiary of Zydus Lifesciences, has secured USFDA approval for ZYCUBO (copper histidinate), the first and only treatment for Menkes disease in the United States. The rare, fatal genetic disorder affects copper absorption and transport, leaving patients with severe neurological symptoms and a life expectancy of less than three years without treatment. The approval marks a milestone for Zydus Lifesciences, positioning the group in the rare disease space with a therapy that addresses a critical unmet need. “For the first time, patients have access to an approved therapy, offering hope where no options existed,” said Dr. Sharvil Patel, Managing Director of Zydus Lifesciences. ZYCUBO, a subcutaneous injectable formulation, restores copper homeostasis in pediatric patients. Clinical trials showed early treatment reduced the risk of death by nearly 80 percent compared to untreated controls, with median overall survival reaching 177 months versus 17.6 months for untreated patients. The USFDA granted ZYCUBO multiple designations, including breakthrough therapy, Fast Track, and Orphan Drug status. Sentynl acquired the asset from Cyprium Therapeutics in 2023 and advanced it through pivotal studies. The therapy also holds Orphan Designation in Europe. What is Menkes disease? Menkes disease, an X-linked recessive disorder caused by ATP7A gene mutations, has an estimated birth prevalence as high as 1 in 8,664 live male births. Untreated patients typically die by age three. ZYCUBO is not indicated for Occipital Horn Syndrome. The approval underscores Zydus Lifesciences’ push into innovation-led therapies beyond its generics base. The company employs 29,000 globally and aims to expand its rare disease portfolio through Sentynl’s U.S. platform."
'President Trump doesn’t impact my investing cycle': Raamdeo Agrawal explains why,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/president-trump-doesn-t-impact-my-investing-cycle-raamdeo-agrawal-explains-why-13771306.html,"As Donald Trump's incessant tariff flipflops continue to impact markets globally, ace market expert and Motilal Oswal Group Chairman Raamdeo Agrawal said that the US President's decisions don't impact his investments. While speaking at CNBC TV18 Market Forum event ""The Alpha Generators for 2026"", Agrawal acknowledged that Trump's decisions do have an impact on the world because the world has become very interdependent due to the multi-lateral globalisation. ""On one side Trump is happening, and on the other side, AI is happening. I don't know how to figure out which one will impact how much. So, I am very happy that I am in India. I do things that I understand, and you need to have a view on four-five things and find ideas out of it,"" he said. Entrepreneurs or magicians? On being asked if such macro uncertainties can pose a threat to valuation, Agrawal said equity is a very ""exotic"" asset class. ""Equity has a huge power to take in a lot of uncertainty, and yet, there are few entrepreneurs who can act like a magician and navigate all kinds of risks. We have to find them, who can navigate such hard times and deliver earnings,"" the market analyst added. Agrawal further said that AI may have reduced the terminal value of Indian IT sector from what it was five year back. However, the analyst took the example of Yoga to explain the fast adoption of AI in India. “Yoga was discovered in India. However, people in US and other countries practice it more than us now. Similarly, AI was established in US or China, but we are the fastest and biggest adopter of AI,” he said, adding that Indian IT services companies will deliver the highest number of AI agents. How will markets perform in 2026? After nearly muted returns in 2025, the market expert expects 2026 to see better performance from the markets as the earnings cycle is turning after a brief lull over the past four-five quarters. He noted that the government is also trying its best to support the economy through various measures, including GST rationalization. Agrawal sees GDP recovery over the next 12 months, which in turn will boost earnings and subsequently markets. Which sectors will outperform? ""Large caps have better chances to perform well in the markets, than midcaps and smallcaps. PSUs still have lot of steam. They are much more reasonably valued than the private sector, and earnings growth is almost 2x higher than the private sector,"" the analyst said. He was also very optimistic about the auto sector, and said investors should buy auto ETFs. Also read: Will markets see a pre-Budget rally? Don't expect broad-based buying, say analysts"
"Budget 2026: Will markets see a pre-Budget rally? Don't expect broad-based buying, say analysts",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/budget-2026-will-markets-see-pre-budget-rally-don-t-expect-broad-based-buying-say-analysts-13771172.html,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will be presenting Union Budget 2026 on February 1. Investors are looking forward to a rally ahead of the Budget presentation, though markets remain in red at present. Sensex dropped more than 250 points (0.3 percent) to close at 83,627.69 on January 13. Nifty 50 fell around 58 points (0.22 percent) to end the session at 25,732.30. How did markets react ahead of the previous Budget? Markets remained more or less flat with no major surprises ahead of Budget 2025. After closing 2024 at 23,644.80, Nifty 50 hit the month's high at 23,689.50 on January 9, 2025, marking only a marginal increase from December 31, 2024 closing level. Overall, the index ended January 2025 with slight losses before Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented Union Budget 2025 on February 1. Sensex too more or less mirrored Nifty’s performance during the month, falling 0.8 percent in January 2025 before the Budget presentation. ""Historical trends indicate that the Indian market typically underperforms in January preceding a budget, with the Nifty falling in four of the last five years due to profit-booking and policy uncertainty. Current indicators reinforce this cautious outlook,” said Santosh Meena, Head of Research at Swastika Investmart. Will markets rally ahead of Budget 2026? The pre-Budget periods are characterised by higher levels of market volatility and not the usual straight-line move to the higher side, as the market tries to price in its views on fiscal spending, said Siddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director, Vibhavangal Anukulakara. Swapnil Aggarwal, Director at VSRK Capital, also said that investors can expect some degree of pre-Budget positioning in the markets, though it is likely to be selective rather than a broad-based rally. However, Maurya said there could be bouts of buying in selected sectors, identified with the focus area of the Government, such as infrastructure, manufacturing, and consumption. He added that one cannot expect a broad-based move purely on expectation. ""The market shall have to await the Budget measures to ensure that concerns on growth are dealt with and fiscal discipline is seen,"" he concluded. Aggarwal meanwhile said that the sentiment typically improves on expectations of growth-supportive measures, especially around capital expenditure, infrastructure push, and incentives for emerging sectors as the Union Budget approaches. Cautious optimism: ""Recent market action suggests cautious optimism, with participants closely tracking macro signals, global cues, and fiscal discipline. While volatility may persist in the near term, incremental buying could emerge in pockets where policy continuity and earnings visibility are expected,"" the analyst said. That said, markets are unlikely to price in aggressive outcomes ahead of the Budget, and any upside may remain measured until there is clarity on actual announcements, Aggarwal said, adding that the near-term trend points towards consolidation with intermittent rallies, as investors balance Budget optimism with valuation concerns and global uncertainties. Which sectors will likely benefit? Ahead of the Union Budget 2026, the market focus is sharpening on sectors likely to benefit from a government push for economic growth, particularly through capital expenditure and rural revival, said Santosh Meena, Head of Research at Swastika Investmart. Infrastructire and defence: According to Meena, investors should look closely at infrastructure and defence, where expectations for sustained high allocation remain strong to support 'Make in India' initiatives. In the infrastructure space, companies like HG Infra Engineering and Larsen & Toubro (L&T) are top picks due to strong order books, while the defence sector offers opportunities in Bharat Electronics (BEL), Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL), and Mazagon Dock as they benefit from localization policies. Renewables and critical minerals: Additionally, renewables and critical minerals are gaining traction, with stocks like National Aluminium Company (NALCO), Tata Power and GMDC in focus due to the global shift toward green energy and energy security. Consumption and agriculture: The consumption and agriculture sectors are critical themes this year, driven by expectations of fiscal stimulus to address rural distress, Meena said. “The market anticipates measures such as enhanced subsidies or tax relief to boost disposable income, which would directly benefit the rural economy. Consequently, agricultural inputs are a key area to watch, with stocks like UPL, Dhanuka Agritech, Fertilisers And Chemicals Travancore (FACT) and Coromandel International positioned to gain from farm support schemes,” according to the analyst. This rural recovery narrative extends to broader consumption plays - FMCG giants like Hindustan Unilever (HUL) and ITC are defensive bets, while Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) serves as a strong proxy for both auto and rural demand. Banks: Financials, particularly State Bank of India (SBI) and HDFC Bank, remain foundational holdings to play the overall credit growth story, according to Meena. ""While a sharp, broad-based rally ahead of the Budget appears unlikely, selective upside cannot be ruled out in budget-sensitive sectors. Any pre-Budget rally is likely to be narrow, stock-specific and driven by expectations around capex, defence spending and rural support rather than a sustained market-wide move,"" the analyst concluded. Investors may thus see pockets of rally, particularly in sectors linked to capital expenditure, infrastructure, manufacturing, defence, and rural consumption, as traders position themselves ahead of favourable policy cues, said Karthik Narayan, Vice President – Title, Tax & Transition, Stellar Innovations. However, a broad-based and sustained rally will depend upon how far the Budget can balance growth stimulus with fiscal discipline, the analyst said. What should investors do? Narender Agarwal, Founder & CEO at Wealth1, also noted that any rally ahead of the Budget is likely to be measured rather than euphoric, and investors should avoid aggressive positioning purely on expectations, focusing instead on fundamentally strong businesses. “For investors, the Budget should be seen as an opportunity to align portfolios with India’s long-term growth themes rather than focus solely on short-term volatility. A growth-oriented Budget, backed by strong economic momentum, can support broader market participation and set the stage for sustained returns beyond the Budget event,” said Tushar Badjate, Director of Badjate Stock & Shares."

Amid positive global cues, domestic indices opened on a strong note, extending the previous session’s sharp recovery. However, the benchmarks failed to sustain early gains and remained largely rangebound through the day, eventually closing with modest losses. At close, the Sensex was down 250.48 points or 0.30 percent at 83,627.69, and the Nifty was down 57.95 points or 0.22 percent at 25,732.30.

Click to View More Outlook for January 14 Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets remained volatile on the weekly expiry day and ended marginally lower amid mixed cues. After an initial uptick, the Nifty 50 drifted lower for most of the session, though a rebound in the final hour trimmed some losses and helped it settle at 25,732.30. Sectoral trends were mixed, keeping participants engaged, with IT and metal stocks among the gainers, while realty and pharma remained subdued and closed in the red. The midcap and smallcap segments witnessed selective participation, with smallcaps showing modest resilience even as overall market breadth stayed moderate. Market action reflects the interplay between earnings-related reactions and global uncertainty. Early optimism was supported by encouraging IT earnings and signs of progress in India–U.S. trade discussions, which lifted sentiment in the first half. However, the lack of follow-through and fresh selling in heavyweights across sectors capped the upside. Ongoing geopolitical and global trade concerns also continued to weigh on risk appetite, keeping trading largely stock-specific. We maintain a cautious view on the Nifty and suggest continuing with a sell-on-rise approach until the index decisively reclaims the 26,000 level. A decisive breach of medium-term 100-day EMA, placed near 25,600, could accelerate the decline toward the 25,400 zone. Given the earnings season and fluctuating global cues, it is prudent to stay light and wait for clearer confirmation of the next directional move. Participants should focus on stock-specific opportunities and prefer a hedged approach amid the prevailing choppiness. Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities After witnessing an excellent upside recovery from the lows on Monday, Nifty slipped into weakness from the highs on Tuesday and closed the day's lower amidst recovery note. After opening on an upside gap, Nifty failed to sustain the highs and slipped into weakness in the early-mid part of the session. Smart recovery has emerged from near the lows of 25600 and Nifty finally closed off the lows. The opening upside gap has been filled completely. A long bear candle was formed on the daily chart with long lower shadow. Technically, this market action indicates presence of crucial overhead resistance around 25900-26000 levels. But the buying has started to emerge from near the lower supports. This is positive signal and hints at the possibility of eventual breakout in the short term. The underlying short-term trend of Nifty remains positive. The formation of higher bottom reversal pattern on intraday chart (60 min) indicates that the market could move up from here and surpass the hurdle of 25900-26000 levels in the next few sessions. Immediate support is placed at 25600 levels. Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

The shares of the pharma major dropped to a nine-month low of Rs 1,436.60 apiece, before recovering some losses to close at Rs 1,448 apiece.

Citi Research said that the generic version will likely add $30 million to $40 million to the company's annual US revenues. Cipla has been awaiting FDA's approval for its own generic version of Advair.

It has revised the tag-line from ""10,000+ products delivered in 10 minutes"" to ""30,000+ products delivered at your doorstep"". This comes after Union Labour Minister Mansukh Mandaviya held meetings over the past month with major quick commerce and delivery platforms, including Blinkit, Zepto, Zomato and Swiggy, to discontinue the marketing and branding of 10-minute delivery services. Other quick commerce platforms, such as Swiggy and Zepto, may also follow suit after the intervention by the Union Ministry of Labour, which was concerned about the welfare of the delivery workers trying to meet such tight deadlines.

The shares of the company rose to Rs 232.55 apiece, snapping a four-session losing streak. JM Financial on Ixigo: JM Financial noted that Ixigo shares have corrected approximately 20 percent since the end of November 2025 due to expectation of relatively slower growth in the flights business in Q3 and Q4 FY26 after recent disruptions in the industry and an unfavourable base (Kumbh Mela benefit last year), and uncertainty around margin due to ramp-up in its tech, supply-side and promotional investments towards hotels’ OTA. However, the domestic brokerage believes that the current phase represents a temporary earnings and sentiment overhang, which shall ease over the next few quarters. “From a medium-to-long-term perspective, Ixigo remains well positioned to grow faster than peers owing to its effective cross-sell of services across various apps, sharp focus on superior customer experience and robust traction for its differentiated value-added services,” it added. JM Financial however lowered its target price for the stock to Rs 275 per share from Rs 300 per share, based on a cut in FY26–28E earnings by 4–8 percent and target P/E to 60x (from 65x). The latest target price implies an upside potential of more than 29 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. The domestic brokerage noted that the recent correction has materially improved the risk-reward, prompting the double upgrade. Ixigo share price: Ixigo shares have fallen more than 3 percent in the past five days, and over 8 percent in the past one month.

The brokerage played down investor concerns around deposit growth and the elevated loan-to-deposit ratio. HDFC Bank stock was last seen at Rs 936.5 in afternoon trade, little changed on the day, after touching an intraday high of Rs 947.7 in the morning, when it was up about 1.1 percent. The stock remains up around 15 percent over the past year, outperforming the Nifty 50’s roughly 11 percent gain over the same period. Broader market was trading weak on Tuesday, with benchmark indices BSE Sensex and Nifty 50 shedding about 0.5 percent each, amid a volatile session. Banking index Bank Nifty lost 0.1 percent in the afternoon after staying in green through the day. In a note, CLSA reiterated its ‘Outperform’ rating on HDFC Bank with a target price of Rs 1,200 per share. The brokerage noted that the stock has corrected 6-7 percent since the Q3 FY26 operational update. It described that this correction comes amid a growing frustration among investors over moderating deposit growth and a rise in the loan-to-deposit ratio to about 99 percent. Also read | Cash segment margin likely to reduce, SEBI panel endorses margin rationalisation proposal However, CLSA argued that most of these concerns are either misconceived or temporary.

The brokerage also highlighted valuation comfort, noting that after the recent correction, HDFC Bank is trading at a 10-12 percent price-to-book discount to ICICI Bank, and said it is an opportunity for investors to look past near-term noise and focus on the franchise’s longer-term strengths. HDFC Bank, India’s largest private sector lender by market capitalisation at about Rs 14.4 lakh crore, is currently valued at around 19.9 times earnings, with a dividend yield of roughly 1.18 percent.

Analysts have suggested what this can mean for Indian stock markets. Indian benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty have seen some pressure last year amid Trump’s tariff flipflops. The almost muted annual returns in 2025 came as Trump increased tariffs on Indian exports to US to 50 percent, citing New Delhi’s continued purchase of Russian oil. Amid Iran's biggest anti-government protests in years, Trump took to Truth Social to announce his new round of tariffs. ""Effective immediately, any Country doing business with the Islamic Republic of Iran will pay a Tariff of 25% on any and all business being done with the United States of America,"" he wrote. ""This Order is final and conclusive,"" Trump said without providing any further detail. No official documentation from the White House on the new round of tariffs has yet been released. Iran, a member of the OPEC oil producing group, has been heavily sanctioned by Washington for years. It exports much of its oil to China, with Turkey, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates and India among its other top trading partners. Sensex dropped more than 545 points (0.65 percent) to 83,328, while Nifty 50 fell 157 points (0.61 percent) to 25,632.90, as seen at 1 pm on Tuesday. Fresh pressure on India? Trump’s decision to impose a 25 percent tariff on countries trading with Iran adds fresh pressure on India, which is already facing tariffs of up to 50 percent on several exports to the US. Together, this creates a potential tariff burden of as much as 75 percent on certain Indian goods. India–Iran trade stood at $1.68 billion in FY25, and mainly comprised exports of rice, food products, medicines, tea, and spices to Iran, while imports include chemicals and dry fruits, said Abhinav Tiwari, Research Analyst at Bonanza. He noted that while the trade size is modest, the concern is that the US tariff applies broadly to countries doing business with Iran, not just to Iran related goods. “A key strategic risk is the Chabahar Port project in Iran, which is vital for India’s access to Central Asia. While the project currently has a US sanctions waiver valid until April 2026, there is uncertainty over whether it will remain protected,” the analyst further said. 'A key macro overhang for Indian markets, but...' The renewed threat of a 25 percent tariff by former US President Donald Trump has resurfaced as a key macro overhang for Indian markets, but its actual economic impact needs to be viewed with perspective rather than panic, said Harshal Dasani, Business Head at INVasset PMS. He noted that while headlines suggest a broad-based disruption, India's direct export exposure to the US remains concentrated in select segments such as textiles, gems and jewellery, leather goods and certain engineering products. Impact on Rupee? A potential 25 percent tariff threat on exports to the US is already being felt as it adds to trade tensions, which affect rupee weakness, especially in sectors that are more sensitive to exports, said Siddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director at Vibhavangal Anukulakara. “Although the Indian economy is more domestically oriented, stock markets related to exports can suffer short-term turbulence in stock markets due to the potential growth impact from tariffs. Investors will watch to what level of diversification can happen to avoid the negative impact due to tariffs,” he said. “For markets, the immediate reaction has been driven more by sentiment than fundamentals. Export-linked stocks may witness near-term volatility, but India’s broader market construct today is far more domestically anchored than in previous tariff cycles. Consumption, financials, infrastructure and services continue to be driven by internal demand rather than US trade flows,” Dasani said, adding that this phase will let investors distinguish headline risk from earnings reality. In the near term, the impact should be manageable due to low Iran trade exposure and ongoing India–US negotiations, and over the medium term, a negotiated settlement remains the most likely outcome, which would limit market damage and reduce long term risks, said Tiwari from Bonanza.

"Jefferies says new labour codes may add to margin pressures for IT companies, sees lower wage hikes at senior level",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/jefferies-says-new-labour-codes-may-add-to-margin-pressures-for-it-companies-sees-lower-wage-hikes-at-senior-level-13770233.html,"Global brokerage firm Jefferies on Monday said India’s new labour codes are likely to add to margin pressures for information technology (IT) firms and could lead to lower wage hikes, particularly at the senior level. The labour codes, which came into effect in November, mandate that employee wages must be at least 50 percent of cost to company (CTC), with benefits such as provident fund and gratuity to be calculated on wages. This is expected to raise recurring employee costs for IT companies and also result in a large one-time financial impact. ""New labour codes will add to the margin pressures from slower revenue growth, AI-led business mix change and potentially higher onsite wage hikes in FY27 and FY28 due to changes in H-1B visa norms,"" Jefferies said in a note. It added that a 2 percent increase in Indian employee costs could reduce FY27 earnings estimates by 2-4 percent for IT companies. Firms are likely to offset part of the impact through lower wage hikes, especially at senior levels. IT services firm HCLTech reported an 11.2 percent decline in consolidated net profit to Rs 4,076 crore for the October-December quarter of FY26, mainly due to a one-time provision of Rs 719 crore linked to the implementation of the new labour codes. The Noida-based company had posted a net profit of Rs 4,591 crore in the same quarter last year. Excluding the one-time impact, HCLTech said net profit would have stood at Rs 4,795 crore. Regulatory filings showed that the impact on earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) was Rs 956 crore. HCLTech said the one-time impact under the labour code amounted to about Rs 900 crore, and that this would not affect its hiring plans. Chief People Officer Ram Sundararajan said the company has factored in all required provisions in the current quarter’s pay changes and does not expect any further significant incremental costs related to the new rules. Country’s largest IT services exporter Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) also reported a 13.91 percent decline in profit for the December quarter at Rs 10,657 crore, largely due to the one-time impact of the labour codes. The company said the implementation of the new labour codes during the quarter led to a statutory impact of Rs 2,128 crore. Excluding this, profit would have grown 8.5 percent to Rs 13,438 crore.

"Auto stocks decline for fifth straight session: Analysts say overall outlook is positive, cite multiple tailwinds",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/auto-stocks-decline-for-fifth-straight-session-analysts-say-overall-outlook-is-positive-cite-multiple-tailwinds-13770407.html,"The shares of automakers and auto-parts makers dropped in trade on January 13, extending losses for the fifth consecutive session. Analysts have however expressed optimism, and what investment strategy investors should take after the consolidation. The fall in the share prices pushed the Nifty Auto index down around 0.7 percent to 27,817, as seen at 12.15 pm on Tuesday. The index has fallen more than 3 percent in the past five days. Top auto losers today: Tube Investments of India shares were the top loser on the index, falling around 2 percent to trade at Rs 2,367 apiece. Exide Industries, Uno Minda, Maruti Suzuki, Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) and TVS Motor Company shares meanwhile fell more than 1 percent each. Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles and Hero MotoCorp shares fell nearly 1 percent each, while Ashok Leyland and Eicher Motors shares were trading in the red with marginal losses. Bucking the trend, Sona BLW Precision Forgings, Bosch, Bajaj Auto, Bharat Forge and Samvardhana Motherson International shares were trading in the green with marginal gains. Here's what analysts say: The recent fall in the auto stocks reflects near-term profit booking and demand concerns, rather than a structural breakdown of the sector, said Siddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director at Vibhavangal Anukulakara. Harshal Dasani, Business Head at INVasset PMS, also said that the recent correction in Nifty Auto should be viewed more as a phase of consolidation than a breakdown in the sector’s fundamentals. ""Auto stocks have delivered strong returns over the last year, and some near-term profit booking was inevitable, especially amid broader market volatility. Importantly, the medium-term outlook for the auto sector remains constructive, supported by multiple policy and demand tailwinds,"" he said. From the March 2025 low of 19,300, the Nifty Auto index has rallied nearly 40 percent to 27,555, indicating that a lot of optimism is already priced in, said Tushar Badjate, Director of Badjate Stock & Shares. He noted that the recent correction reflects valuation rationalisation rather than demand stress. What lies ahead? Going forward, a rebound in demand indicators, stability in macros, and clarity in policies might help the auto names stabilize, Maurya said. However, he cautioned that till the time clear triggers on consumer demand or sector-specific catalysts emerge, volatility and range-bound action are likely to persist in the near term. Dasani noted that the potential GST rationalisation on automobiles, expectations of interest rate cuts, and income tax relief aimed at boosting disposable income can meaningfully support vehicle demand across segments. Lower financing costs tend to have a direct and visible impact on auto sales, particularly in passenger vehicles and two-wheelers. In addition, government focus on manufacturing, EV adoption, and infrastructure continues to support long-term volume growth, the analyst said. Will Trump's 500% tariff threat impact auto stocks? Concerns around the proposed 500 percent US tariff should not materially alter the outlook for Indian auto manufacturers, as India’s direct auto exports to the US are limited, Dasani highlighted. The impact, if any, is more likely to be felt by select auto ancillary players supplying components to global OEMs, rather than domestic auto makers themselves. Is this correction a buying opportunity? ""Overall, the recent correction offers an opportunity to recalibrate positions in a sector where structural drivers remain firmly intact and visibility on demand recovery continues to improve,"" Dasani concluded. Badjate said that going ahead, growth is likely to be more selective—led by OEMs with strong product pipelines, export visibility and rising EV penetration, which is gradually emerging as a structural growth driver for the sector. ""While near-term volatility may persist amid the ongoing Q3 earnings season, the broader structural outlook for the sector remains intact. The current correction could offer a buying opportunity for long-term investors, supported by healthy fundamentals and the Government’s continued focus on incentives for electric vehicles and hybrid mobility. Investors should maintain a selective approach, with a preference for sector leaders that have strong EV exposure,"" said Vishnu Kant Upadhyay, AVP -Research & Advisory at Master Capital Services. Ajit Mishra, SVP of Research at Religare Broking, said that with the earnings season underway, volatility is likely to persist, driven by stock-specific results. ""While most stocks in the sector are participating in the move, Bajaj Auto, Eicher Motors, TVS Motor, M&M, and Maruti are displaying relative strength and can be considered for accumulation on declines,"" he said.

"TCS, HCL Tech shares swing into green by noon after early losses, as investors factor in Q3 results weakness",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/tcs-hcl-tech-shares-swing-into-green-by-noon-after-early-losses-as-investors-factor-in-q3-results-weakness-13770306.html,"Shares of Tata Consultancy Services and HCL Technologies recovered from early losses to trade modestly higher by noon on Tuesday, as investors reassessed Q3 FY26 earnings and absorbed the initial wave of cautious brokerage commentary. The recovery in the IT majors' shares also followed a reversal in broader markets, with BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty erasing morning losses to edge into the green. TCS stock was trading at Rs 3,258.1 around noon, up 0.6 percent, reversing losses seen in early trade amid concerns around limited growth visibility. The recovery followed a firm 1.1 percent rise in the previous session ahead of the earnings announcement -- this suggests that some investors may have used early weakness to selectively add positions. Also read | TCS stock outlook cautious after Q3 results; brokerages flag weak growth visibility HCL Technologies shares also clawed back losses to trade 0.15 percent higher at Rs 1,670.1 by midday. The stock had fallen more than 2 percent in the morning trade after its Q3 results, despite a strong operational performance and a guidance upgrade, as brokerages flagged constraints on near-term upside. The intraday rebound in both stocks points to stabilising sentiment after initial post-results selling. In both cases, analysts broadly acknowledged steady execution, healthy deal pipelines, and resilient margins. However, enthusiasm remained tempered by broader concerns around growth sustainability and near-term earnings momentum. Also read | HCL Tech Q3 results review: Fundamentals improve, but brokerages cautious on near-term stock outlook For TCS, brokerages highlighted muted international business trends, modest forward indicators, and limited clarity on a sharp growth acceleration, keeping most houses in neutral or cautious territory despite operational stability. For HCL Tech, analysts pointed to seasonality risks -- especially in the products business -- along with valuation comfort and historical post-results performance patterns as factors restraining near-term optimism. Despite the midday recovery, both stocks remain under pressure on a longer-term basis. TCS is still down over 24 percent over the past year, while HCL Tech has fallen more than 16 percent over the same period. The investor focus remains firmly on whether deal execution, demand momentum, and AI-led initiatives can translate into a more durable growth recovery.

"Capital One, Amex shares sink on Trump's credit-card threat",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/capital-one-amex-shares-sink-on-trump-s-credit-card-threat-13770303.html,"Shares of Capital One Financial Corp., American Express Co. and other US banks sank after President Donald Trump called on credit-card companies to cap interest rates at 10% for a year, a move that could wipe out billions in profits for one of the banking industry’s biggest businesses. Capital One, the largest US card issuer, tumbled 6.4% in New York, the biggest decline in nine months, after the president surprised the industry with a move he said could go into effect next week. American Express dropped 4.3% and JPMorgan Chase & Co., No. 2 in the card rankings, slid 1.4%. Card interest rates, which have been hovering above 20% in recent years, have been a target of US lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, with bills popping up proposing similar caps and meeting stiff resistance from the industry. Trump, speaking Sunday to reporters, set a Jan. 20 deadline for companies to comply or risk being “in violation of the law.” The cap proposed by the president “could wipe out earnings from cards for a year,” Mike Mayo, an analyst at Wells Fargo & Co., said in a note. The idea “would ruin card economics (eliminate most of card earnings today) and incentives would be to stop lending,” Mayo said. Citigroup Inc. dropped 3%, while Wells Fargo slipped 1% and Synchrony Financial lost 8.4% on Monday. Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. also fell. While those companies aren’t issuers of credit cards, they rely on fees generated when consumers use their products. Despite the political appeal of Trump’s proposal, several analysts questioned whether approval of a rate cap was likely, given the strength of the banking industry’s pull in Congress and limited legislative momentum. “Given how severe it is, it is hard to imagine it moving forward,” Brian Foran, an analyst at Truist Financial Corp., wrote in a note. In response to Trump’s call, industry groups including the Bank Policy Institute and Consumer Bankers Association struck a measured tone. “We share the president’s goal of helping Americans access more affordable credit,” the groups said in a joint statement late Friday. “At the same time, evidence shows that a 10% interest rate cap would reduce credit availability and be devastating for millions of American families and small-business owners who rely on and value their credit cards, the very consumers this proposal intends to help.” Should the idea take effect, fallout would probably affect lower-income consumers the most as banks restrict their access to loans, according to several analysts. “As credit availability is curtailed, consumers will have to rely on alternate sources of consumer lending,” KBW Inc. analyst Sanjay Sakhrani wrote in a note, adding that those alternatives are “significantly more expensive” for borrowers. Barclays Plc, the British lender that relies on credit cards as a key part of its US consumer banking business, slumped 2.4% in London, the firm’s biggest loss since Nov. 18. What Bloomberg Intelligence Says: Any US cap or restriction on credit card rates would hit Barclays hardest among European banks. The lender’s US consumer bank is expected to generate £3.6 billion revenue in 2025 (12% of group total), but 5% of pretax profit, with credit cards a key element. Though President Donald Trump’s demand that credit card interest rates are capped at 10% might not be enforced in full given the strength of US bank lobby groups. — Phil Richards, BI banking analyst There could be a few winners as well. Wells Fargo’s Mayo said that if general availability of traditional credit card loans is reduced due to rate caps, the attractiveness of buy-now, pay-later firms such as Klarna Group Plc and Affirm Holdings Inc. could increase. Shares of Klarna fell 2.7% and Affirm lost 6.6%. Airlines, which generate substantial profits from credit-card partnerships, also took a hit on Monday. Delta Air Lines Inc. shares fell 1.8%, United Airlines Holdings Inc. dropped 1.7% and Southwest Airlines Co. slipped 1.5%. Retailers with substantive credit-card portfolios also took a hit. Macy’s Inc. fell 5.4% on Monday and Kohl’s Corp. shares were down 3.9%. Follow all LIVE updates from the stock markets here."

The VSF business is entering a margin recovery phase in 2HFY26, supported by a modest rebound in China pricing, stable pulp costs, and consistently high utilization levels (>90%). These should drive an expansion in EBITDA/kg and margins over FY27–28E. In chemicals, GRASIM’s leadership in chlor-alkali and epoxy resins, coupled with ongoing investments to raise chlorine integration to ~70%, underpins steady revenue and EBITDA growth despite a correction in caustic soda price due to overcapacity. Outlook The paints business (Birla Opus), while currently in an investment-led phase, provides a scalable growth optionality in a large and under-penetrated market, with rapid distribution expansion and brand investments positioning the business for medium-term operating leverage once scale is achieved.

The service business growth was majorly led by ER&D segment that reported another quarter of strong growth (+3.1% QoQ CC vs 2.2% QoQ CC LQ). The service-led growth was largely aided by extop 20 accounts (+2.3% QoQ), which implies the decision making and execution cycle remains strong at the lower-end of the pyramid. Again, the advanced AI revenue growth (19.9% QoQ CC) is largely a component of short-burst deals that further validates the velocity of smaller deal remains strong. The new deal TCV reported at USD3.0b, which includes one of the mega deals (USD473m) of five-year strategic engagement. We believe the service-led growth should continue its momentum in FY27/FY28 on the back of strong order wins and growing AI revenue stream. Hence, we are revising the topline CC growth upward by 30bps/20bps to 7.0% and 7.7% for FY27E/FY28E. Despite the beat on margins in Q3, we expect Q4 will see some normalization, while additional new labour code would also keep the margin in check. Outlook The stock is currently trading at 22x and 19x FY27E/FY28E EPS. We assign 22x to FY28 EPS to arrive at a TP of 1,910.

Eternal shares jump 4% on increased hopes for higher MSCI weightage,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/eternal-shares-jump-4-on-increased-hopes-for-higher-msci-weightage-13769992.html,"The shares of Zomato-parent Eternal jumped more than 4 percent on January 13 after the company’s latest shareholding pattern showed an increase in the foreign headroom for the stock. This may have triggered hopes for an increase in MSCI weightage for the stock, which sharply rose to a near one month-high of Rs 297.30 apiece in the early trading hours of Tuesday. Eternal shareholding pattern: Eternal’s foreign headroom has now increased to above 25 percent, CNBC-TV18 quoted Eternal’s latest shareholding pattern as at the end of the October-December quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026. The stock currently carries half weight in the MSCI index due to low foreign headroom, CNBC-TV18 quoted an analyst sales note as saying. It added that the latest hike in foreign headroom can make the stock eligible for the full MSCI weightage. The analyst note quoted by the business channel further said that any such change can possibly be reflected in the February MSCI review and potentially result in passive inflows worth $390 million. Moneycontrol couldn't independently verify the report. Eternal share price: Eternal shares have seen some correction recently, falling around 2 percent in the past one month. However, the stock gained more than 4 percent in the past five days, and over 8 percent in the past one month. The stock currently has a P/E ratio of 1,464, and a market capitalization of around Rs 2.83 lakh crore. It is now the top gainer on benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty.

Buy Tata Consultancy Services; target of Rs 4040: Prabhudas Lilladher,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-tata-consultancy-services-target-of-rs-4040-prabhudas-lilladher-13769997.html,"Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Tata Consultancy Services The revenue performance (+0.8% QoQ CC) exceeded our estimates (+0.5% QoQ CC), aided by broad-based growth, international business was up 0.4% QoQ CC. Beyond furloughs, the growth momentum within BFS was steady and should rejoin the positive growth trajectory from Q4. The pockets of weakness is visible in certain sub-segments of Retail and Manufacturing, while essential and non-Automotive delivered healthy performance. The slowdown in legacy offerings is partly compensated against strong uptick in AI revenue stream, which reported annualized revenue run-rate of USD1.8bn (+17.3% QoQ CC). The management was confident of sustaining international revenue growth in the coming year on the back improving visibility in North America and continued momentum within key pockets. Given the low base of revenue in FY26 and steady recovery within international business, we expect 5.4% USD revenue CAGR over FY26-28E. Outlook On the margins, the compensation revision is behind, while we also anticipate the residual headcount trimming exercise to be executed in Q4. Hence, we are revising FY26E/FY27E/FY28E, adjusting operating margin up by 10bps/20bps/10bps respectively. We assign 23x to FY28E EPS that translates a TP of 4,040. Maintain BUY.

"HCL Tech stock extends losses, falls over 2% after Q3 results as brokerages flag limited near-term upside",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/hcl-tech-slips-in-early-trade-after-q3-results-brokerages-flag-limited-near-term-upside-13769863.html,"Shares of HCL Technologies deepened losses in late morning trade on Tuesday, slipping more than 2 percent as investors reacted to a largely cautious set of brokerage views following its Q3 FY26 results. HCL Tech stock was trading 2.37 percent lower at Rs 1,628 around 10 am, hovering near the day’s low, underperforming a firmer broader market. The stock has now given up its pre-results gains and remains over 16 percent lower over the past year. That was also a key factor tempering sentiment even after a strong operational quarter. Broader market sentiment was positive, with benchmark indices NSE Nifty and BSE Sensex seeing moderate gains. Brokerages broadly acknowledged HCL Tech’s strong Q3 delivery, marked by robust deal wins, stable margins, and a guidance upgrade that places the company at the top end of the peer growth range. However, most analysts stopped short of turning bullish on the stock, flagging seasonality risks, valuation comfort, and historical return patterns as constraints on near-term performance. Citi maintained a Neutral rating with a target price of Rs 1,700, noting that while HCL Tech’s forward indicators and deal pipeline are stronger than peers, the current valuation leaves little room for sharp upside. HSBC and CLSA reiterated Hold calls, with CLSA highlighting that Q4 growth could turn sequentially negative due to seasonal weakness in the products business, a phase during which the stock has historically underperformed. Among the brokerages, Nomura stood out with a Buy rating and a target of Rs 1,810, citing confidence in HCL Tech’s AI-led, services-driven growth strategy and expectations of margin normalisation in FY27.

TCS shares slip in early trade as cautious brokerage views weigh after Q3 results,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/tcs-shares-slip-in-early-trade-as-cautious-brokerage-views-weigh-after-q3-results-13769817.html,"Shares of Tata Consultancy Services edged lower in early trade on Tuesday, as investors weighed the company’s Q3 FY26 results against a largely cautious brokerage outlook that flagged limited visibility on a sustained growth recovery. TCS stock slipped to Rs 3,220.4 in the opening minutes, down 0.6 percent, reversing part of the 1.1 percent rise in the previous session ahead of the earnings announcement. Broader market sentiment was marginally positive, with benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty trading slightly higher in early deals. The early weakness reflects subdued investor sentiment following the results, despite analysts broadly agreeing that TCS delivered an in-line operational quarter excluding exceptional items and maintained stable margins. However, the absence of a clear acceleration in demand has kept expectations in check, particularly for the company’s international business, which remains a key driver of overall growth. Most brokerages stopped short of turning positive on the stock, citing muted international growth trends, modest deal momentum, and limited evidence of growth leadership returning in the near term. Forward indicators such as deal conversion and headcount trends were also seen as offering little immediate comfort. Several brokerages retained ‘neutral’ or ‘hold’ ratings, signalling a cautious stance on near-term prospects. Citi remained bearish on the stock, while CLSA stood out as the only brokerage with a clearly constructive view, pointing to stable margins, a sharp rise in AI-led revenue, and management’s confidence in stronger growth in CY26. TCS had reported a 14 percent year-on-year decline in reported Q3 net profit, largely due to hefty exceptional charges linked to restructuring, statutory impacts, and a legal provision. Excluding these one-offs, profit rose 8.5 percent, highlighting operational stability. The company also announced a Rs 57 per share dividend, including a special payout. With the stock now down over 24 percent over the past year, investors remain focused on whether demand momentum and deal activity can improve meaningfully in the coming quarters to support a sustained re-rating.

"HCL Tech Q3 results review: Fundamentals improve, but brokerages cautious on near-term stock outlook",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/hcl-tech-q3-results-review-fundamentals-improve-but-brokerages-cautious-on-near-term-stock-outlook-13769773.html,"HCL Technologies’ Q3 FY26 results have strengthened confidence in its operational momentum and deal pipeline, but brokerages are not uniformly bullish on the stock, signalling only a limited near-term upside despite improved earnings visibility. Shares of HCL Tech closed marginally higher at Rs 1,667 on Monday, up 0.34 percent, ahead of the results. The stock remains down over 16 percent over the past year, underperforming the broader market. That is also a key reason brokerages are tempering enthusiasm even after a strong quarter. Brokerage commentary broadly agreed that the business is executing well, but valuations and seasonal risks cap upside, advising against aggressive buying at current levels. What worked: Deal wins, guidance upgrade, margins HCL Tech delivered a strong operational quarter, marked by a 43 percent year-on-year jump in trailing twelve-month deal TCV, improved margins, and a guidance upgrade. Services revenue growth guidance for FY26 was raised to 4.75-5.25 percent in constant currency, placing HCL Tech at the upper end of the peer group. Citi issued a Neutral rating with a target price of Rs 1,700, noting that HCL Tech’s forward indicators are better than peers, aided by rising headcount and management focus on identifying new spend areas. Citi also raised FY27-FY28 earnings estimates by 2 percent. HSBC gave a Hold call with a target of Rs 1,815, highlighting that HCL Tech has sustained Q2 momentum into Q3 and now sits at the top end of the peer growth range. HSBC sees operating margins trending towards 18-19 percent in FY27, with a 5-6 percent medium-term revenue CAGR appearing achievable. Why caution persists despite a strong quarter Despite the upbeat fundamentals, brokerages remain wary of near-term performance of HCL Tech shares, citing seasonality, valuation comfort, and historical return patterns. CLSA kept a Hold rating with a target of Rs 1,661, pointing out that even at the upper end of guidance, Q4 implies negative sequential growth in constant currency, largely due to seasonal weakness in the products business. CLSA also flagged that historically, HCL Tech stock has delivered weak returns between Q4 and Q2, compared with strong gains in the Q2-Q3 period. The bullish pocket: AI-led services strategy The one clear positive differentiator is HCL Tech’s AI-focused, services-led growth strategy, which is gaining traction. Nomura stood out with a Buy rating and a target price of Rs 1,810, implying an upside of nearly 9 percent. It cited a clear earnings beat, guidance lift, and margin resilience. Nomura views the company’s asset-light, services-centric AI push as structurally positive, while expecting margins to normalise favourably in FY27.

TCS stock outlook cautious after Q3 results; brokerages flag weak growth visibility,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/tcs-stock-outlook-cautious-after-q3-results-brokerages-flag-weak-growth-visibility-13769723.html,"The outlook for Tata Consultancy Services stock has turned cautious to mixed following its Q3 FY26 results. Most brokerages stopped short of a bullish stance and flagged limited growth visibility, muted international momentum, and constrained margin upside despite an in-line operational quarter. TCS shares had risen a firm 1.1 percent on Monday to close at Rs 3,243 on the NSE ahead of the earnings announcement. Even so, the stock remains down more than 24 percent over the past year, with investors watching whether growth momentum can revive in CY26. Citi struck a bearish note with a ‘Sell’ call on TCS stock and a target price of Rs 3,020 per share. While it acknowledged that Q3 performance was in line excluding exceptional items, Citi flagged weak forward indicators -- that includes just a 1.5 percent year-on-year growth in trailing twelve-month total contract value, and a 4 percent YoY decline in headcount. The brokerage warned that muted international business growth could disappoint. It noted that nearly half of the quarter-on-quarter revenue growth was driven by equipment and software, rather than core services. Nomura maintained a ‘Neutral’ rating with a target price of Rs 3,300, describing the quarter as a modest beat on revenue and margins. However, it said visibility on TCS’ growth leadership remains limited. While management expects CY26 to outperform CY25, Nomura cautioned that meaningful margin expansion in FY27 appears unlikely without a stronger and broader-based growth recovery. HSBC also remained cautious, retaining a ‘Hold’ rating and a target price of Rs 3,450. The brokerage said Q3 reflected a largely status quo quarter, with no material change in growth trends. While margins were solid and demand commentary was positive, HSBC said the stock’s risk-reward appears balanced at current levels. CLSA offered a clearly positive stance, with an ‘Outperform’ call and a target price of Rs 3,593, implying an upside of about 11 percent on TCS share price. CLSA highlighted TCS’ 0.8 percent constant-currency sequential revenue growth in Q3 FY26 and management’s confidence in stronger CY26 growth. It also pointed to the sharp rise in annualised AI revenue to $1.8 billion, up 17.3 percent quarter-on-quarter, as a key positive. However, it noted that the order book declined 7 percent sequentially to $9.3 billion. EBIT margin stood at 25.2 percent, up 70 basis points year-on-year despite wage hikes. TCS had reported a 14 percent year-on-year fall in reported Q3 net profit due to large exceptional charges, even as profit excluding one-offs rose 8.5 percent. The company also announced a Rs 57 per share dividend, including a special payout.

"MidCap, SmallCap inflows in 2025 hit record high despite scheme delivers muted returns",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/mutual-funds/midcap-smallcap-inflows-in-2025-hit-record-high-despite-scheme-delivers-muted-returns-13769363.html,"Inflows into mid-cap and small-cap mutual fund schemes touched record levels in 2025 despite sharp volatility in broader markets, the absence of foreign investors from these segments, stretched valuations, and muted earnings. AMFI data showed that mid-cap schemes received Rs 49,939 crore during the year, up 46 percent from a year earlier, while small-cap schemes attracted Rs 52,321 crore, an increase of 53 percent. Market performance remained mixed during the period. The BSE MidCap index rose 1.1 percent in 2025, while the BSE SmallCap index declined 6.6 percent. In comparison, the Sensex and Nifty gained nearly 9 percent and 10.5 percent, respectively. Axis Securities’ Rajesh Palviya said the inflows were supported by steady SIP investments and investors continuing to add to their mutual fund holdings, based on the strong three-year and five-year outperformance of mid-cap and small-cap stocks over large-cap shares. Market breadth stayed weak. Of the 140 stocks in the BSE MidCap index, 86 ended the year with negative returns, while in the BSE SmallCap index, 871 of the 1,186 stocks were in the red. In the BSE100 index, 61 stocks posted gains and 39 recorded losses. Palviya said investors have been using market declines to average their investments, as SIP inflows into mid-cap and small-cap schemes continue on a regular basis. Domestic investors have been the main source of net inflows over the past two years and have preferred mid-cap and small-cap schemes over large-cap funds. Foreign investors have largely stayed away from these segments and have mainly been selling large-cap stocks, which has further concentrated domestic flows into mid-cap and small-cap schemes. The share of mid-cap and small-cap schemes in total equity inflows also increased during the year. Mid-cap funds accounted for a record 14.26 percent of total equity inflows, up from 8.7 percent in 2024 and 14.18 percent in 2023. Small-cap funds also saw their share rise to a two-year high of 14.26 percent, compared with 8.68 percent in 2024 and 25.4 percent in 2023. Total equity inflows for the year stood at Rs 3.51 lakh crore, down 11.19 percent from Rs 3.94 lakh crore in 2024 and Rs 1.62 lakh crore in 2023. Analysts said the absence of outflows despite nearly 16 months of muted returns indicates continued investor commitment. They said many investors remain focused on a three- to four-year horizon, even as near-term returns have been weak, while investment in assets such as gold and silver at current elevated prices is harder to justify for long-term allocations. Independent research analyst Ambreesh Baliga said inflows into mutual funds are likely to continue going ahead as mid-cap and small-cap funds have delivered better results than individual portfolios. While many individual portfolios are down 20 percent to 30 percent or more, he said even the worst-performing mid-cap and small-cap funds were down only about 5 percent to 6 percent as of the end of December. Baliga said investor interest remains as long as losses are limited. He added that when losses become large, investors stop averaging, liquidity in the secondary market declines, selling pressure rises, and stocks can fall further, sometimes leading to margin calls."
"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade JSW Energy, SJVN, Alkem Labs, BSE, State Bank of India, and others on January 13?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-jsw-energy-sjvn-alkem-labs-bse-state-bank-of-india-and-others-on-january-13-13769531.html,"Equity benchmarks bounced back with 0.4 percent gains on January 12, but market breadth remained weak, with 1,866 shares declining against 1,044 advancing shares on the NSE. The market may extend its upward journey, but sustainability remains the key factor to watch. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi SJVN | CMP: Rs 80.53 SJVN registered a decisive breakout on January 2 above the Rs 76.5 level, supported by a strong surge in volumes, confirming the strength of the move. Over the last 2–3 sessions, the stock witnessed a healthy pullback towards the breakout zone, accompanied by declining volumes, indicating a classic low-volume retest. Currently, price action has reversed from this support area, suggesting renewed buying interest. On the hourly chart, the DMI has generated a bullish crossover, while the ADX is placed well above the threshold of 20, currently around 32.5, highlighting strong trend momentum. This combination of price, volume, and momentum signals strengthens the bullish outlook. Hence, SJVN is expected to witness a fresh bullish move in the coming few sessions, with the breakout zone now acting as a strong support base. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 81–79 zone, with a target of Rs 86. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 86 Stop-Loss: Rs 76 JSW Energy | CMP: Rs 498.8 JSW Energy has recently confirmed a bullish breakout from an inverse Head and Shoulder pattern, supported by a strong surge in volumes, which validates the reliability of the formation. This breakout indicates a clear shift from a corrective phase to a potential trend reversal on the upside. The stock is currently reversing after witnessing a mild pullback, but the decline is accompanied by relatively low volumes, suggesting that selling pressure is weak and the move is more of a healthy retest rather than a breakdown. Importantly, the weekly pivot support is closely aligned with the neckline of the pattern, strengthening the support zone. This confluence enhances the probability of a fresh upward move from current levels. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 500–490 zone, with a target of Rs 550. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 550 Stop-Loss: Rs 475 Rail Vikas Nigam | CMP: Rs 331.65 RVNL has witnessed a sharp correction after a strong up-move and is now approaching a crucial support zone in the Rs 330–320 range. This zone coincides with prior consolidation and visible demand on the chart, indicating that accumulation interest is likely to emerge at lower levels. On the daily timeframe, the stock has slipped back into the Ichimoku cloud after facing rejection near the upper band. This suggests a transition from a strong bullish phase to a corrective or consolidation phase. However, as long as Rs 303 is protected on a closing basis, the broader price structure remains intact and supportive of a potential trend resumption. Momentum indicators also reflect a healthy reset. The RSI has cooled off from overbought levels and is currently hovering near 45, indicating normalization rather than weakness. Overall, the setup favours a pullback-led rebound once stability is established near the support zone. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 333–327 zone, with a target of Rs 364. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 364 Stop-Loss: Rs 303 Jay Thakkar, Vice President & Head of Derivatives and Quant Research at ICICI Securities Alkem Laboratories | CMP: Rs 5,867 Alkem Labs has witnessed some long additions amid its recent uptrend, and the stock has also provided a breakout from the falling trendline. During the recent market correction, the stock did not correct and instead consolidated within a range of Rs 5,600–5,800, and now appears ready for an upside breakout. The stock has the highest Call open interest at Rs 6,000 and faces no major resistance ahead. Hence, the short-term target is Rs 6,000, and beyond that Rs 6,100, while immediate support is seen at Rs 5,750 levels. Buy Alkem Labs Futures in the range of Rs 5,850–5,970. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 6,000, Rs 6,100 Stop-Loss: Rs 5,750 Hindustan Zinc | CMP: Rs 628.25 Hindustan Zinc has corrected in the short term; however, this was mainly on account of profit booking. Hence, dips should be utilised as a buying opportunity. The stock appears to have consolidated within a short-term range of Rs 650–590 and now has significant support in the Rs 590–600 zone, while on the upside, Rs 660 is the minimum target. Although there is huge Call open interest at higher levels, there was significant Call unwinding in the last trading session, indicating that as long as the stock is trading well above its maximum pain level of Rs 620, the short-term trend remains positive. Buy Hindustan Zinc Futures in the range of Rs 625–630. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 650, Rs 660 Stop-Loss: Rs 615 Info Edge India | CMP: Rs 1,312.9 Info Edge had been consolidating within a range of Rs 1,400–1,300 for quite some time, and the breakdown below this range, along with an increase in open interest, indicates short build-up. Earlier, the stock had fallen due to long unwinding; however, it now appears that short positions are being added, which is a negative sign for the stock going ahead. There have been significant Call additions in the Rs 1,320–1,400 strikes, which is a negative indicator. However, the Rs 1,260–1,280 strikes have seen good Put additions as well, so a break below those levels could lead to a major sell-off. Until then, the stock may consolidate for some time, but eventually it looks relatively weak. The stock is now trading below its maximum pain as well as VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price), both of which will act as crucial resistances in the near term. Sell Info Edge Futures in the range of Rs 1,320–1,300. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 1,250, Rs 1,200 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,365 Vidnyan S Sawant, Head of Research at GEPL Capital Ramco Cements | CMP: Rs 1,083.5 Ramco Cements is showing a positive multi-timeframe setup. On the monthly chart, the stock has posted three consecutive bullish mean reversions from the 12-month EMA and is holding above the previous month’s high, indicating strengthening momentum. On the weekly scale, it is building a base near the 50% Fibonacci retracement and the 50-week EMA, supported by a pickup in volumes above the 20-week average. A bullish MACD crossover further reinforces the constructive outlook and signals potential continuation of the uptrend. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,170 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,040 BSE | CMP: Rs 2,790.6 BSE continues to exhibit strong relative strength on the weekly chart, trading in a tight range around the 12-week EMA despite heightened market volatility. On the daily timeframe, volumes have expanded above the 20-day average while the stock sustains above the 26-DEMA, indicating active participation and trend support. The weekly RSI near 60 further confirms sustained bullish momentum.

"Metropolitan Stock Exchange: BSE, NSE to soon have a new rival, reports CNBC-Awaaz",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/metropolitan-stock-exchange-bse-nse-to-soon-have-a-new-rival-reports-cnbc-awaaz-13768818.html,"After BSE and NSE, India is all set to see another stock exchange being added to the markets. The Metropolitan Stock Exchange (MSE) is set to begin its operations and trading is expected to begin on the new exchange within the next two weeks, CNBC-Awaaz reported citing sources. As liquidity remains a concern around a new stock exchange, MSE has planned a comprehensive liquidity enhancement scheme under which it will appoint market makers to provide liquidity support for approximately 130 stocks, the channel added. MSE has raised Rs 1,240 crore in two tranches in December 2024 and August 2025, which saw participation from major brokerage houses Groww and Zerodha. However, analysts said that breaking the NSE-BSE duopoly may not be easy as they hold strong market shares, the channel added. According to data cited by the report, NSE holds approximately 90-92 percent share, while BSE holds 8-10 percent share in the cash segment. In stock futures and options (F&O), NSE holds around 95 percent share, while BSE holds around 5 percent share. In index F&O, NSE holds nearly 80 percent share, and BSE holds approximately 20 percent share. Moneycontrol couldn't independently verify the report. Notably, market regulator SEBI in 2025 introduced new rules to allow only two weekly equity derivatives expiries in any segment during the week. Currently, NSE has Nifty 50 expiry on Tuesdays, while BSE has Sensex expiry on Thursdays. A new stock exchange on the market may face competition and the risk of low liquidity as a result of this. Earlier, MSE had introduced a Liquidity Enhancement Scheme (LES) in its Equity and Equity Derivatives segments. Then known as MCX Stock Exchange, it had introduced the scheme in 2013 in order to encourage participation in these segments. ""The MCX-SX Liquidity Enhancement Scheme will appoint 3 market makers for futures contract in 50 liquid scrips. These market makers are incentivized to ensure that quotes and depth is available. For other stock futures, options and equity cash, all participants are incentivized to maintain passive orders which will help in building depth,"" it had said."

Click to View More Outlook for January 13 Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities After showing sharp weakness in the last few sessions, Nifty witnessed an excellent bounce back from the lows on Monday and closed the day with decent gains of around 106 points. After opening on a weak note, Nifty slipped into weakness in the early part of the session. A sharp recovery has emerged from the lows of 25473 levels and the market sustained the gains till the end. A long bull candle has been formed on the daily chart with long lower shadow. Technically, this market action is indicating significant turnaround in the market for the short term. This is positive indication one may expect further upside in the short term. The underlying trend of Nifty seems to have turned up post sharp weakness of last week. Having recovered from the key lower levels decisively, Nifty could advance towards the next hurdle of 26000-26100 levels in the next few sessions. Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities Today, the benchmark indices witnessed a sharp recovery from the lower levels. The Nifty ended 107 points higher, while the Sensex was up by 302 points. Among sectors, the Metal Index outperformed today, rallying over 2 percent, whereas the Realty and Media indices shed over 1 percent. Technically, after an early morning intraday sharp selloff, the market took support near 25,500/82,700 and bounced back sharply. From the day's lowest point, the market bounced back over 300/1,200 points, which is largely positive. We are of the view that the intraday market texture is positive, but buy on dips and sell on rallies would be the ideal strategy for day traders. On the downside, 25,650/83,500 and 25,600/83,300 would act as key support zones, while 25,900-25,950/84,300-84,500 could serve as immediate resistance areas for the bulls. However, below 25,600/83,300, sentiment could change. If that happens, traders may consider exiting their long positions.

Nifty Midcap 100 index, which fell more around 1 earlier, was down 0.42 percent. What did the US Ambassador say? The partial recovery was seen in the markets after US Ambassador Sergio Gors said there is ""no partner more essential than India"" to the President Donald Trump-led country. He further added that both the countries continue to engage actively, and the next call on the much-awaited trade deal will take place tomorrow. ""President TRUMP will be visiting India in next 1-2 years hopefully,"" he added.

This came after the firm reported a consolidated net loss of Rs 196.55 crore for Q3 FY26, as against a net profit of Rs 165.67 crore reported in Q3 FY25. Sequentially however, the net loss narrowed from the Rs 307.13 crore reported in Q2 FY26.

US Ambassador to India Sergio Gor said there is ""no partner more essential than India"" to the President Donald Trump-led country, boosting markets.

""Real friends can disagree, but resolve the difference,"" Gor said, framing current trade negotiations as part of a broader, resilient partnership. Notably, India-US trade deal has seen significant delays, putting pressure on markets for most of 2025 on the back of rising Trump tariffs. Analysts had noted that markets may see some rally in case of any positive news around this front. Sergio also referred to strategic initiatives like Pax Silica, calling it a US-led framework with India as a key partner. “Both sides continue to actively engage. Not an easy to cross the finish line, but determined,” he said, underscoring the challenges and commitment in ongoing talks. Senator Marco Rubio added, “This year will be a year of reciprocity,” highlighting the mutual intent to enhance cooperation across trade and strategic sectors. ""Positive statement by U.S. ambassador on continuation of talks on India-U.S. trade deal and reiteration of the importance of India as a trade partner have led to short covering during the day,"" said Sunny Agrawal, head of fundamental equity research at SBICAPS Securities. Technical view on Bank Nifty: Axis Direct had said that the trend-deciding level for Bank Nifty today is 59,382. Notably, the index has now crossed this level. “If Bank Nifty trades above this level, it may rally up to 59609-59967-60195 levels. However, if it trades below 59382 evels, we may witness profit booking in the market, and the index may correct up to 59024-58796-58439 levels,” it said. For Bank Nifty, the 20-day SMA at 59,500 would act as a key level for traders, said Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities. He added that below this mark, the correction wave is likely to continue until 58,800–58,500. Conversely, above 59,500, it could bounce back up to 59,800–59,000, the analyst added. Choice Broking meanwhile saw immediate support near 59,000, and said that a breakdown could open the door toward 58,900–58,800. On the upside, 59,500–59,600 remains a strong resistance band, and only a decisive move above this zone would revive bullish sentiment, it added. Top bank gainers today: IndusInd Bank shares were the top gainer on the index today, rising more than 2 percent each. ICICI Bank shares followed, rising more than 1 percent. State Bank of India (SBI), AU Small Finance Bank, Yes Bank and Union Bank of India shares gained nearly 1 percent each.

Neutral Vodafone Idea; target of Rs 11: Motilal Oswal,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/neutral-vodafone-idea-target-of-rs-11-motilal-oswal-13768450.html,"Motilal Oswal's research report on Vodafone Idea We believe the relief measures indicate GoI’s steadfast commitment to maintaining a 3+1 market structure in the Indian telecom industry. The relief measures are a significant positive for Vi, with the NPV of AGR dues cut by ~73% to ~INR240b, on our estimates, with potential for further relief on the base AGR dues. This should enable Vi’s long-pending debt raise and increase capex over the medium term. However, Vi still owes ~INR1.23t to GoI toward deferred spectrum liabilities, with large ~INR62b/INR166b/INR270b annual repayments over FY27/FY28/FY29-32, and obtaining a similar relief (interest waiver, further deadline extensions) on the same would not be straightforward. Further, despite a potential increase in capex, regaining/retaining market share would remain a tall ask, given Vi’s competitors’ superior offerings and FCF generation. Outlook We reiterate Neutral on Vi with an unchanged TP of INR11/share, premised on 14x FY28 reported EV/EBITDA (implies ~22x FY28 pre-INDAS EV/EBITDA), a significant premium to larger peers.

Buy JSW Energy; target of Rs 657: Motilal Oswal,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-jsw-energy-target-of-rs-657-motilal-oswal-13768387.html,"Motilal Oswal's research report on JSW Energy We attended JSW Energy’s (JSWE) plant visit at Vijaynagar on 7-8th Jan’26, in which the company showcased its green hydrogen and floating solar plants. The 5,000 m3 /hour green hydrogen plant was commissioned in Nov’25 for captive consumption of JSW Group’s steel plant, which is located at an adjacent site. Green hydrogen’s economics remain challenging vs. conventional fuels, and current costs continue to hover around USD3.5-4/Kg vs. the USD 2-2.5/Kg level required to achieve mass-scale commercialization. The floating solar plant with a capacity of 20 MW was commissioned in Sep’25 and is a novel concept, which eliminates land acquisition requirement, provides natural cooling (thus boosting generation by slowing down module degradation), though IRRs are broadly similar to ground-mounted solar plants. JSWE has nearly doubled its operational installed capacity from 7.2GW in FY24 end to 13.2GW as of 2QFY26, underscoring strong execution capabilities. The reduction in merchant exposure to ~5% of the installed base significantly enhances its cash flow stability. With a project pipeline of 17.2GW, of which ~74% is already secured under longterm PPAs, the company remains on track to achieve its targeted generation capacity of 30GW by FY30. The company also has a 29.4 GWh of locked-in energy storage capacity with the aim of reaching 40 GWh of energy storage capacity by FY30. Outlook Driven by a strong, PPA-backed renewable pipeline, we build in EBITDA and PAT CAGR of 49% and 31%, respectively, over FY25-28E. We have a BUY rating on JSWE with a TP of INR657 (34% upside).

This comes after the stocks declined sharply last week after US President Donald Trump threatened 500 percent tariffs on countries that continue to engage in business with Russia, including India. What did the US Ambassador say? US Ambassador to India Sergio Gor assumed charge in New Delhi on Monday, and said that both the countries continue to engage actively, and the next call on the much-awaited trade deal will take place tomorrow. ""President TRUMP will be visiting India in next 1-2 years hopefully,"" he added. He added that Trump had conveyed his best wishes to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, referring to the relationship between the two leaders as genuine. ""Real friends can disagree, but resolve the difference,"" Gor said, framing current trade negotiations as part of a broader, resilient partnership. Textile and shrimp stocks: Avanti Feeds shares rose over 2 percent to close at Rs 820.90 apiece, marking a 5 percent intraday jump from its day's low. Apex Frozen Foods jumped 8 percent intraday to Rs 272 apiece. Costal Corp shares gained around 2 percent. Gokaldas Exports shares also rose 7 percent intraday to its day’s high at Rs 648.5 apiece, before paring some gains.

Tejas Networks shares meanwhile tumbled 13 percent to a record low level. IREDA shares rose to Rs 142.3 apiece on Monday, snapping a two-session losing streak. Tejas Networks shares meanwhile dropped around 13 percent to hit a fresh 52-week low of Rs 364.25 apiece. IREDA Q3 Results: IREDA on January 9 reported a standalone net profit of Rs 584.91 crore for the October-December quarter of FY26. This marks a 37.5 percent year-on-year (YoY) increase from the Rs 425.38 crore net profit reported in the same period of the previous financial year. The firm’s revenue from operations meanwhile rose more than 25 percent YoY to Rs 2,129.87 crore during the quarter under review, from Rs 1,698.45 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year. IREDA’s outstanding loan book increased 28 percent YoY to Rs 87,975 crore, while net worth rose 38 percent YoY to Rs 13,537 crore. Asset quality however deteriorated, with net non-performing assets (NPA) margin rising from 1.5 percent to 1.68 percent. The company’s strong December quarter performance was driven by healthy sanctions and robust disbursements across solar, state utilities, and ethanol segment, ICICI Direct Research said. Meanwhile, net interest income grew nearly 40 percent on year, supported by balance sheet expansion and the company saw an improvement with its interest spread at 2.63 percent, according to the brokerage. ICICI Direct Research said that despite temporary stress in Q1, IREDA’s Q3 performance confirms normalisation in margins, asset quality and earnings. It added that long-term structural growth story for renewable financing remains intact, supported by balance sheet growth, stable margins and sustained asset quality. “IREDA reported strong Q3 FY26 results with significant profit growth and improved asset quality sequentially. The renewable energy financier saw robust loan book expansion amid rising disbursements. Outlook remains positive, supported by renewable energy sector momentum,” said Khushi Mistry, Research Analyst at Bonanza. Tejas Networks Q3 Results: Tejas Networks on January 9 reported a consolidated net loss of Rs 196.55 crore for Q3 FY26, as against a net profit of Rs 165.67 crore reported in Q3 FY25.

The firm’s revenue from operations meanwhile tumbled more than 88 percent to Rs 306.79 crore in the December-October quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026. The Tata Group company said that it ended Q3 FY26 with an order book of Rs 1,329 crore. “Our net debt was Rs 3,349 crore compared to Rs 3,738 crore in Q2 FY26 mainly due to lower working capital, partly offset by capex, gross debt of Rs 3,885 crore and cash of Rs 537 crore,” said Tejas Networks CFO Sumit Dhingra.

Buy Avenue Supermarts; target of Rs 4600: Motilal Oswal,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-avenue-supermarts-target-of-rs-4600-motilal-oswal-13768091.html,"Motilal Oswal's research report on Avenue Supermarts Avenue Supermarts (DMART) delivered a strong beat on profitability in 3QFY26, driven primarily by gross margin (GM) expansion. GM expanded 50bp YoY to 14.6% (~60bp beat) in 3Q, likely driven by GST reduction benefits (lower discounting) and a favorable category mix (higher GM&A and FMCG share at the expense of the lower-margin Food category). Further, after several quarters of elevated cost of retailing (CoR), DMART reported a stable CoR per sqft in 3Q, driving 50bp EBITDA margin expansion to 8.4% (~80bp beat) and a 20% YoY standalone EBITDA growth (11% beat). While margin performance was encouraging, revenue growth moderated to ~13% YoY, largely driven by ~14% store area addition, as like-for-like (LFL) growth moderated to 5.6% (vs. 6.8% in 2Q and 8.3% YoY). DMART added 10 stores in 3QFY26 (~27 in 9MFY26 vs. 22 YoY). The acceleration in the pace of store additions remains the primary growth driver for DMART. We continue to build in 60 store additions in FY26. Outlook We assign a ~43x FY28 EV/EBITDA multiple (implying ~79x FY28 P/E) to arrive at our revised TP of INR4,600. We reiterate our BUY on DMART.

Margins delivered a positive surprise, with EBITDA margin at 8.4%, driven by execution discipline and cost control despite an unfavourable mix. However, growth momentum remains capped, with L2L moderating to 5.6% in Q3FY26 (vs ~8.3% in Q3FY25; ~6.8% in Q2FY26), alongside store productivity still below pre-Covid levels. The staples-led mix and calibrated DMart ReADY expansion support earnings visibility and downside protection, but limit ticket expansion and operating leverage amid rising competition and urban basket fragmentation. A meaningful re-rating would require a sustained recovery in discretionary-led L2L growth and store-level productivity, rather than further margin support alone. Earnings growth is therefore likely to remain steady rather than sharp. Maintain HOLD. Outlook We cut our revenue estimates by ~2% / ~4% for FY26E/27E and increase our earnings estimates by ~4% for FY26E, modelling revenue/ EBITDA/PAT CAGR of 16%/17%/17% over FY25-28E.

D’Mart’s Q3FY26 results beat our estimates at the EBITDA/PAT level by 9.2%/10.2%, led by lower overheads and healthy gross margins, despite 11bps YoY increase in cost of retailing and 36bps QoQ decline in GM&A contribution. Operating parameters continue to remain weak with sales/store down 1.1%, sales/ft down 0.3%, bills cuts/store/day decline of 2.1% YoY (flat in last 2 years) and flattish average bill value YoY. Interest burden also increased from Rs505mn to Rs1011bn in 9mFY26, in line with our expectations, which makes D’Mart an ideal candidate for equity dilution. The company added 10 stores in Q3FY26; we expect store additions to accelerate in Q4, with total openings of 57/65/70 in FY26/FY27/FY28. For Q4FY26, we forecast GM/EBITDA margins of 14.2%/7.1% on a low base, translating into healthy double-digit PAT growth. Outlook However, intensifying competition from quick commerce across FMCG/nonFMCG, deteriorating mix and volatile store economics raise concerns over the long-term sustainability of these margins.

DMart stock climbed 2.4 percent to Rs 3,892.6, after touching an intra-day high of Rs 3,918.6 (up 3.1 percent). At current levels, Avenue Supermarts commands a market capitalisation of about Rs 2.53 lakh crore and is up around 11 percent over the past year. The buying interest follows a margin-led earnings beat in the October-December quarter. Avenue Supermarts, which operates the DMart retail chain, reported a 17 percent year-on-year rise in net profit to Rs 856 crore, while revenue grew 13.3 percent to Rs 18,101 crore. EBITDA rose over 20 percent, with margins expanding to 8.1 percent, aided by lower discounting after GST changes and favourable category mix. The rally in DMart stock has played out ahead of brokerage comfort. Post-quarterly results notes from Citi, Jefferies and Nuvama flagged muted same-store (LFL) growth of 5.6 percent and raised concerns around the sustainability of margin gains, particularly amid intensifying competition from quick-commerce platforms. Citi has a ‘Sell’ call on the stock, while Jefferies and Nuvama are at ‘Hold’. In contrast, Motilal Oswal has reiterated a ‘Buy’ rating with a target price of Rs 4,600, implying about 21 percent upside from current levels. The brokerage cited the profitability beat and gross-margin recovery, while also flagging pricing competition from quick commerce as a key near-term risk. Brokerages have also pointed to subdued like-for-like growth trends and the upcoming CEO transition as factors that could keep sentiment guarded despite the recent stock move.

Lemon Tree Hotels shares jump today on Warburg-led restructuring; brokerages see value unlocking,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/lemon-tree-hotels-shares-jump-today-on-warburg-led-restructuring-brokerages-see-value-unlocking-13767843.html,"Shares of Lemon Tree Hotels Ltd rose nearly 2 percent on Monday, extending recent gains. Investors reacted positively to the company’s sweeping restructuring plan, the entry of private equity major Warburg Pincus, and bullish brokerage commentary pointing to value unlocking and balance-sheet deleveraging. Lemon Tree Hotels stock was trading at Rs 152.8 at about 9:50 am, up 2 percent, after hitting an intraday high of Rs 155.99. Lemon Tree shares are up 11.6 percent over the past one year, valuing the company at under Rs 12,100 crore. The proposed scheme of arrangement will split the group into two focused platforms -- an asset-light hotel management and brand entity under Lemon Tree Hotels; and an asset-heavy ownership and development platform under Fleur Hotels. As part of the transaction, Warburg Pincus will acquire APG’s entire 41.09 percent stake in Fleur Hotels and has committed to invest Rs 960 crore in Fleur in tranches to support future expansion. Post-restructuring, Lemon Tree Hotels shareholders will directly own 32.96 percent of Fleur Hotels, with Lemon Tree itself holding 41.03 percent and Warburg Pincus owning the remaining 26.01 percent. Fleur Hotels will own 41 hotels with 5,813 keys, while Lemon Tree Hotels will manage 89 hotels with 6,011 keys under an asset-light model. Brokerages remain constructive on the stock, citing sharper business focus, improved capital structure and clearer valuation discovery. Nuvama has issued a ‘Buy’ rating on Lemon Tree Hotels with a target price of Rs 178 per share. The brokerage said the composite reorganisation and Warburg’s entry as a strategic investor in Fleur Hotels meaningfully strengthens the group’s long-term profile. Nuvama added that Warburg’s buyout of APG’s stake effectively reintroduces the global private equity firm to the capital table and de-risks future large-scale capital expenditure at Fleur. Investec, which has a ‘Buy’ rating and a higher target price of Rs 187, said the long-awaited Fleur demerger should unlock value in Lemon Tree’s high-growth, high return on capital employed, asset-light business. The brokerage expects Lemon Tree to emerge as a zero-debt platform, free from a leveraged ownership structure, while Warburg’s Rs 960 crore committed infusion is seen as a key driver of Fleur’s growth. Investec also said that management’s reaffirmation of its growth strategy adds comfort for shareholders. Lemon Tree Hotels' management has indicated that Fleur Hotels will be listed as a separate entity within the next 12 to 15 months, and that Lemon Tree will announce a dividend distribution policy after the scheme is completed.

Hindustan Zinc shares jump 3% as silver futures hit fresh record high of nearly Rs 2.64 lakh/kg; silver ETFs rise 4%,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/hindustan-zinc-shares-jump-3-as-silver-futures-hit-fresh-record-high-of-nearly-rs-2-64-lakh-kg-silver-etfs-rise-4-13767830.html,"The shares of Hindustan Zinc jumped more than 3 percent on January 12 as silver prices rebounded after a sharp plunge earlier last week. Silver ETFs also mirrored the sharp rise in silver prices, jumping around 3 percent each. Hindustan Zinc shares rose to Rs 625 apiece in the early trading hours of Monday. The company is the largest producer of silver in India, and produces refined silver with a minimum 99.9 percent purity. Silver prices hit fresh lifetime highs: Silver futures with March expiry on the Multi Commodity Exchange of India (MCX) jumped around 5 percent to a fresh lifetime high of Rs 2,63,996 per kilogram. This marks a jump of Rs 11,271 per kg in just one session. The future contracts with May expiry jumped more than 4 percent to an all-time high of Rs 2,70,054 per kg, while those with July expiry rose nearly 4 percent to a lifetime high of Rs 2,77,924 per kg. Spot silver meanwhile soared to a fresh lifetime high of $83.96 per ounce. Fresh geopolitical tensions, tariff threats and a criminal probe into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell may have boosted the appeal of the safe-haven assets like precious metals. Unrest in Iran has killed more than 500 people, a rights group said on Sunday, as Tehran threatened to target US military bases if President Donald Trump carries out his renewed threats to strike the country on behalf of protesters. Fed Chair Powell meanwhile said on Sunday that the Trump administration had threatened him with a criminal indictment over Congressional testimony, an action Powell called a ""pretext"" aimed at putting further pressure on the central bank to lower rates. Investors currently expect at least two Fed rate cuts this year. Non-yielding assets tend to do well in a low-interest-rate environment and during geopolitical or economic uncertainties. Silver ETFs: Silver exchange traded funds (ETFs) mirrored the rise in silver prices. Zerodha Silver ETF jumped more than 4 percent, while UTI Silver ETF, DSP Silver ETF, Axis Silver ETF, ICICI Pru Silver ETF, Nippon Silver ETF, Motilal Oswal Silver ETF, SBI Silver ETF, Mirae Asset Silver ETF, Tata Silver ETF, HDFC Silver ETF, and others gained nearly 4 percent each. These ETFs have delivered returns of up to 176 percent over the past one year as silver prices skyrocketed in 2025. Hindustan Zinc share price: Hindustan Zinc shares fell more than 3 percent in the past five days as silver prices saw some profit booking last week. The stock is however up around 10 percent in the past one month, and over 41 percent in the past six months. The stock has jumped over 125 percent in the past five years. Its P/E ratio currently stands at more than 24. The company has a market capitalization of Rs 2,60,871 crore. What lies ahead? US President Donald Trump is considering imposing steep tariffs, potentially as high as 500 percent, on countries that continue to buy Russian oil. Senator Lindsey Graham said the sanctions would give Trump leverage over major buyers such as China, India, and Brazil, pressuring them to halt purchases of discounted Russian crude that helps finance the war in Ukraine. Given the potential impact on key Russian energy customers, the move could escalate US–China trade tensions, supporting safe-haven demand for gold and silver, said Kaynat Chainwala, AVP Commodity Research, Kotak Securities. Ross Maxwell, Global Strategy Operations Lead at VT Markets however advised caution. ""Industrial demand, especially from green technologies, underpins long-term fundamentals in silver’s high pricing. Short-term rallies often attract rapid inflows that can reverse quickly, leading to sharp pullbacks. If bullish speculative sentiment fades or macro risk appetite returns, silver could correct significantly. A period of volatility is likely, with sharp swings possible. Whilst a prolonged crash isn’t inevitable, we would need to see broader market sentiment turn decisively risk-on,"" he said. Follow all LIVE updates from the stock markets here."

DMart stock ended Friday at Rs 3,807, up 0.45 percent ahead of results, valuing the company at about Rs 2.48 lakh crore. Over the past year, the shares have gained around 8.5 percent. Q3 snapshot: margins lift earnings, growth stays muted For the October-December quarter, DMart reported 17 percent year-on-year growth in net profit to Rs 856 crore and 13.3 percent revenue growth to Rs 18,101 crore. EBITDA rose 20.2 percent to Rs 1,463 crore, with margins improving to 8.1 percent from 7.7 percent a year ago. However, same-store (LFL) growth slowed to 5.6 percent, a key concern across brokerages. Citi: ‘Sell’ on growth slowdown and margin risk Citi has a ‘Sell’ rating on DMart with a target price of Rs 3,150 per share. It said same-store growth slowed to 5.6 percent, driving 13 percent year-on-year revenue growth that came in below its estimates, with staples deflation partly weighing on revenue growth. While it acknowledged that EBITDA and profit rose 20 percent and 18 percent year-on-year and slightly beat estimates, Citi cautioned that margin sustainability remains a risk. It argued that gross margin expansion could be a one-off, linked to FMCG discounts or lower discounting post GST changes. Citi also pointed to a pattern where profit growth lagged revenue growth in 10 of the last 12 quarters, attributing pressure to quick commerce competition and cost inflation. Jefferies, Nuvama: ‘Hold’ calls reflect caution, not comfort Jefferies maintained a ‘Hold’ rating with a target of Rs 4,050, acknowledging the margin-led earnings surprise but underlining moderating revenue growth and subdued LFL trends. It also pointed to execution risks around store additions and the upcoming CEO transition. Nuvama retained a Hold with a target of Rs 4,351, saying profit growth was largely margin-driven, helped by reduced discounting. While it flagged a revival in DMart Ready growth, it tweaked FY26-27 estimates to reflect slower growth and a sharper margin focus.

"Asian stocks open higher after US gains, oil rises",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/asian-stocks-open-higher-after-us-gains-oil-rises-13767436.html,"The dollar fell on concern about the independence of the Federal Reserve after Chair Jerome Powell said threats of a criminal indictment were a consequence of its interest-rate policies. Bloomberg’s gauge of the US currency dropped as much as 0.2% as Powell said the central bank had been served grand jury subpoenas from the Justice Department threatening a criminal indictment over renovations of the Fed’s headquarters. Gold gained as much as 2%, while the Swiss franc, seen as a haven, rose as much as 0.5%. US equity futures fell. “This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions — or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation,” Powell said in a statement. Asian equities rose after US jobs data helped push stocks to new highs on Friday. Shares in Australia and South Korea and equity index futures for Hong Kong all gained, taking their guide from the S&P 500, which climbed 0.6% on Friday to close at an all-time high. Japanese financial markets are shut Monday for a holiday, which means there will be no trading of cash US Treasuries in Asia. The rally in US equities Friday followed largely benign employment data that showed slightly fewer workers were added to the economy than economists forecast, while the jobless rate edged down to 4.4%. Separately, the US Supreme Court failed to weigh in on President Donald Trump’s tariffs, pushing into the future one risk hanging over markets. Gains for stocks in recent days underscore a fragile calm across global markets despite geopolitical uncertainty from Caracas to Tehran, lingering questions over Washington’s tariffs, and signs the dominance of US mega-cap tech stocks may be waning. Oil held its biggest two-day gain since October, as escalating protests in Iran threatened supply from OPEC’s fourth-biggest producer The unrest in Iran has raised the possibility the Islamic Republic may be overthrown, a development that would transform global geopolitics and energy markets. Trump has threatened repercussions if demonstrators were targeted, while Tehran has warned the US and Israel against any intervention. “The situation in Iran seems to be taking the country to the brink. The level of uncertainty in so many geopolitical hotspots is reaching levels not seen since the late 1930s,” Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co., wrote in a client note. “It’s amazing how much complacency exists in the global stock markets right now.” Asian tech shares may get a boost after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported revenue late last week that topped estimates, offering fresh support for the AI trade in the region. Elsewhere, Group-of-Seven finance ministers meet in Washington to discuss rare earths Monday, while New York Fed President John Williams and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic are set to speak. Australian bonds rose with 10-year yields dropping two basis points. The US 10-year yield ended little changed in Friday’s session, with the jobs data leaving expectations for additional Fed interest-rate cuts intact, although the pace of reductions remains in question. Morgan Stanley, Barclays and Citigroup all pushed back their forecasts for Fed rate cuts later in 2026 after Friday’s jobs data."

Track the latest updates on GIFT Nifty right here on Moneycontrol. Indian equity benchmarks extended their losing streak for a fifth straight session on January 9, 2026, primarily due to uncertainty surrounding the US Supreme Court's verdict on the legality of Trump tariffs, which was expected later that day. At close, the Sensex was down 604.72 points or 0.72 percent at 83,576.24, and the Nifty was down 193.55 points or 0.75 percent at 25,683.30. For the week, BSE Sensex and Nifty lost 2.5 percent each.

US Equities (Up) The S&P 500 rallied to a record high close on Friday, lifted by Broadcom and other chipmakers, while a weaker-than-expected jobs report did little to alter expectations of interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve this year.

Crude (Gains) Oil prices extended gains on Monday on growing concerns that intensifying protests in Iran could disrupt supply from the OPEC producer, although efforts to quickly resume oil exports from Venezuela are limiting price gains. Gold (Rises) Gold rose to a record high after US jobs data left expectations for additional US interest-rate cuts intact, while intensifying protests in Iran kept geopolitical tensions elevated.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Ipca Labs, MTAR Technologies, Equitas Small Finance Bank, Lupin, IDFC First Bank, and others on January 12?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-ipca-labs-mtar-technologies-equitas-small-finance-bank-lupin-idfc-first-bank-and-others-on-january-12-13767369.html,"The benchmark indices fell more than seven-tenths of a percent on January 9, with further weakness seen in market breadth. A total of 2,317 shares were under pressure against 569 advancing shares on the NSE. The consolidation is likely to continue following a 2.5 percent loss last week. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Rajesh Palviya, Senior Vice President Research (Head Technical Derivatives) at Axis Securities Ipca Laboratories | CMP: Rs 1,575 On the weekly chart, Ipca Laboratories has experienced a trend reversal by confirming a “triangular” breakout at the Rs 1,519 level on a closing basis. This breakout has been accompanied by huge volumes, signalling increased participation. The daily and weekly Bollinger Band signals indicate increased price movement. The stock is well placed above its 20-, 50-, 100- and 200-day SMAs, which reconfirms the bullish trend. The daily, weekly and monthly strength RSI is in positive territory, signalling rising strength. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,700, Rs 1,825 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,519 MTAR Technologies | CMP: Rs 2,689.7 MTAR Technologies is trending higher, forming a series of higher tops and bottoms, indicating a strong uptrend. Over the past 3–5 months, rising volumes indicate increased participation. The daily Bollinger Band signals indicate increased price movement. The stock is well placed above its 20-, 50-, 100- and 200-day SMAs, and these averages are also inching up along with rising prices, which reconfirms a bullish trend. The daily, weekly and monthly strength RSI is in positive territory, signalling rising strength. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,900, Rs 3,000 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,500 HDFC AMC | CMP: Rs 2,523.4 On the daily and weekly charts, HDFC AMC is trending lower, forming lower tops and bottoms, indicating a negative bias. In addition, the stock is sustaining below its 20-, 50-, 100- and 200-day SMAs, which reconfirms a short- and medium-term downtrend. The daily, weekly and monthly strength RSI is in negative territory, signalling a loss of strength. Short-term traders should consider exiting long positions and selling January futures. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 2,460, Rs 2,360 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,600 Osho Krishan, Chief Manager - Technical & Derivative Research at Angel One Fortis Healthcare | CMP: Rs 903 Fortis Healthcare has experienced a strong resurgence over the past few weeks, followed by a breather that has retraced nearly 50 percent of the rally. Technically, the counter has formed a higher-highs pattern accompanied by a ‘Cup & Handle’ breakout, and sustainability above the 200 DEMA represents a potential trend-reversal scenario from a short- to medium-term perspective. Additionally, the SuperTrend parameter indicates a bullish outlook after an extended period of correction, signalling a turnaround and adding to the bullish case. Hence, we recommend buying Fortis Healthcare around Rs 900–890. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 960 Stop-Loss: Rs 870 Equitas Small Finance Bank | CMP: Rs 66.87 Equitas Small Finance Bank has shown significant buying momentum from the cluster of EMAs around the 60 sub-zone and has surpassed the sloping trendline, indicating the onset of a bullish trend. From a technical perspective, the MACD histogram has demonstrated buying momentum, moving above the signal line and creating a positive crossover. Furthermore, the EMAs are approaching positive crossovers, suggesting that this upward momentum is likely to continue in the near future. Hence, we recommend buying Equitas Small Finance Bank around Rs 64. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 74, Rs 80 Stop-Loss: Rs 57 Kalyan Jewellers India | CMP: Rs 506.9 Kalyan Jewellers has demonstrated substantial consolidation near its significant EMAs. Additionally, the counter has showcased a ‘Symmetrical Triangle’ breakout, backed by increased trading volumes, suggesting growth potential in the forthcoming period. The technical indicators are also strongly aligned with price momentum, indicating a bullish outlook for the near term. Hence, we recommend buying Kalyan Jewellers around Rs 500–495, with a stop-loss at Rs 470, targeting Rs 545–560. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 545, Rs 560 Stop-Loss: Rs 470 Anshul Jain, Head of Research at Lakshmishree Investments Asian Paints | CMP: Rs 2,825.5 Asian Paints, after delivering a 52-week breakout and a sharp 14 percent follow-through move, is now undergoing a healthy retest of its rising 10-week moving average. The consolidation has taken the shape of a tight four-week box near the Rs 2,800 zone, indicating controlled price action rather than distribution. Volumes have picked up over the past two weeks, highlighting relative strength even as the broader market weakens. This behaviour suggests strong hands are defending the trend. The broader structure remains intact, with moving averages aligning as a potential launchpad. A sustained move above the Rs 2,800–2,850 zone can reignite momentum and open an immediate upside toward Rs 3,200, while a decisive break below the 10-week average would be the key invalidation. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,200 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,750. Lupin | CMP: Rs 2,182.2 Lupin has delivered a decisive breakout after nearly 491 weeks and has since spent 58 weeks building a strong base-on-base structure, signalling long-term trend renewal. The consolidation phase has been marked by steady institutional accumulation, indicating conviction rather than speculative churn. Weekly moving averages are now fanning out positively, reflecting rising momentum and improving trend strength across timeframes. The final overhead hurdle sits near Rs 2,200, and a clean breach above this level would unlock a larger pattern target toward Rs 3,000. In the near term, Rs 2,500 remains an intermediate resistance where some supply may emerge. Risk–reward remains favourable as long as the price holds above the upper base, keeping the primary bullish structure intact. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,500, Rs 3,000 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,000 IDFC First Bank | CMP: Rs 86 IDFC First Bank has delivered a decisive breakout from a massive 756-week cup-and-handle formation, clearing the key pivot near Rs 83 and confirming strength above the long-standing Rs 84.5 resistance. The breakout was supported by above-average institutional volumes, signalling conviction rather than short covering. Moving averages across timeframes have fanned out cleanly, reinforcing trend alignment, while the first retest post-breakout has been successfully absorbed, validating the structure. A sustained hold above Rs 84.5 keeps the bullish thesis intact and opens the door to fresh all-time highs beyond Rs 100.37. From a pattern perspective, a 10 percent extension toward the Rs 108–110 zone appears highly probable if momentum continues. Any dip toward the breakout zone is likely to find strong demand unless the stock slips back below Rs 83, which would act as the key invalidation level. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 100 Stop-Loss: Rs 83"

Global AI race shows Asia leading as stocks start 2026 with a bang,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/global-ai-race-shows-asia-leading-as-stocks-start-2026-with-a-bang-13766862.html,"Asia’s technology stocks began 2026 on a tear, with investors betting their momentum and outperformance against US peers will last through the year. Strategists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are overweight and expect further gains driven partly by surging artificial intelligence-related demand and reasonable valuations. Citigroup Inc. says global long-term investors are accumulating Asia’s tech stocks given their importance in the semiconductor supply chain and the potential for earnings upside. A key Asia tech gauge has jumped about 6% so far this year, beating a 2% gain in the Nasdaq 100, as investors rotate toward the region at the core of the global semiconductor supply chain. The shift reflects growing skepticism that US tech can sustain its AI-driven rally after years of outsized gains. Strong fundamentals are reinforcing the move. Samsung Electronics Co. last week posted preliminary operating profit that more than tripled to a record and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s revenue exceeded estimates. Stellar stock market debuts of Chinese AI firms are also adding to the optimism. “This really comes down to a shift in where investors see the best risk-reward right now,” said Dilin Wu, a research strategist at Pepperstone Group Ltd. in Australia. “US tech is like a mature gold mine — already rich in value. Asian tech, on the other hand, is like an under-explored mine — still undervalued but fundamentally strong, ready to reward those who notice it.” The MSCI Asia Pacific Information Technology Index is trading at a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 16.3 times, compared with about 25 times for the Nasdaq 100 Index and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index. That’s even as the Asian gauge has outperformed the Nasdaq by 33 percentage points since the end of 2024, and the Philadelphia measure by about two percentage points. A variety of money managers are investing in Asia tech as they set their portfolios for 2026. George Molina, head of trading at Templeton Global Investments, notes a mix of hedge‑fund, long‑only and passive demand into the cohort, notably in Korea and Hong Kong. In Japan, he sees investors who trimmed AI exposure into year-end adding back. The flows are boosting share prices. TSMC, Samsung and its South Korean peer SK Hynix Inc. — three of Asia’s biggest tech stocks — have already surged between 8% and 16% this year. In Hong Kong, shares of chipmaker Hua Hong Semiconductor Ltd. are up more than 20%. Earnings Potential Another major reason behind the bullishness is higher earnings growth potential. Aggregate earnings-per-share for companies part of the equity benchmarks in South Korea and Taiwan — Asia’s two tech-heavy markets — are seen climbing 79% and 36%, respectively, over the next 12 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s versus a forecast of 28% growth for Nasdaq firms. With Samsung’s preliminary results — boosted by higher memory prices — out of the way, attention now turns to TSMC’s full-year earnings this week. Expectations of improving profitability have already seen about half a dozen brokerages raise their price targets for the stock since the start of the year. Amid all this positive sentiment, Vey-Sern Ling, managing director at Union Bancaire Privee in Singapore, says the main risks for Asian chipmakers are a pulllback in AI spending and geopolitics, especially for Taiwan. Concerns have been mounting over the hundreds of billions of dollars Big Tech has pledged to spend on AI infrastructure. Capital expenditures from Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. are expected to rise 34% to roughly $440 billion over the next year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. China Tech Meanwhile, China is another key element of investing in Asia tech. Enthusiasm over the nation’s tech prowess has only grown in the new year, buoyed by DeepSeek’s paper outlining a more efficient approach to developing AI, the rising global popularity of Kuaishou Technology’s video editing AI model and Beijing’s self-sufficiency drive. Earnings growth for a gauge of China’s tech megacaps is poised for a major inflection point in 2026 when it’s expected to overtake Magnificent 7 for the first time since 2022, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Also underpinning the buoyant sentiment is a growing pipeline of AI-related companies looking to list in Hong Kong and mainland China. Last week alone saw listings by two firms that are seen as challengers to global sector leaders including OpenAI. “AI is a multi-year global growth driver, and North Asia’s technology ecosystem spanning hardware, software, and infrastructure positions the region at the forefront of this trend,” said Gary Tan, a portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments in Singapore."
90 smallcaps sink in double digits as index underperforms,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/90-smallcaps-sink-in-double-digits-as-index-underperforms-13766799.html,"Broader market indices remained under pressure during the week, with mid- and large-cap indices declining around 2.5 percent each, while the small-cap index fell nearly 4 percent, significantly underperforming the benchmark indices. The markets posted their worst weekly performance in over three months, weighed down by rising geopolitical tensions, persistent FII selling, and concerns over potential US tariffs. BSE Sensex index slipped 2,185.77 points or 2.54 percent at 83,576.24, while Nifty50 index shed 193.55 points or 2.45 percent at 25,683.30. Sectorally, Nifty Oil & Gas, Nifty Energy, and Nifty Infra indices declined 4–5 percent during the week. Nifty Metal, Realty, Media, and Auto indices also remained under pressure, each slipping more than 2 percent. In contrast, the Nifty Defence index gained 1.3 percent, while the Nifty Consumer Durables index rose 1 percent. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued to remain net sellers during the week, offloading equities worth Rs 9,209.90 crore. In contrast, Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) provided support to the market, purchasing equities worth Rs 17,594.58 crore. ""Indian equities navigated the first full week of 2026 with caution, reflecting a corrective undertone. The week began on a muted note as expectations of higher government borrowing drove bond yields upward, though strong GST collections and healthy bank credit growth provided some support. Market sentiment, however, weakened amid global headwinds, including the Venezuela–US standoff, concerns over Russian oil imports, China’s restrictions on rare earth exports, and continued FII outflows,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments. ""Profit-booking in autos, metals, and oil & gas weighed on indices, while selective buying in consumer durables, on hopes of a demand revival, offered brief respite. The week ended on a cautious tone ahead of U.S. Supreme Court rulings on tariffs, with fears of additional levies under Russian sanctions overshadowing optimism around earnings recovery."" ""Looking ahead, clarity on global trade dynamics and Q3 earnings will shape market direction. Volatility is likely to persist in the near term, particularly in US exposed companies and sectors such as metals and oil & gas. However, strong domestic fundamentals, resilient GDP growth and robust credit trends, could underpin selective buying where earnings prospects remain favourable."" ""FII flows and currency movements will act as key monitorable, while any positive outcome from India–US trade discussions or easing tariff concerns could spark a short-term rebound. Overall, markets are expected to stay range-bound with a mixed bias, looking forth a balance between external risks and domestic fundamentals,"" he said further. The BSE Small-cap index declined nearly 4 percent during the week, with heavy selling seen across several stocks. Shares of Systematix Corporate Services, Balu Forge Industries, Worth Investment & Trading, VTM, Kiri Industries, Sai Silks Kalamandir, Indian Metals & Ferro Alloys, Transformers and Rectifiers India, Stallion India Fluorochemicals, Wardwizard Innovations and Mobility, Baazar Style Retail, Elecon Engineering Company, Kitex Garments, Faze Three, and Sandur Manganese and Iron Ores tumbled between 15 and 23 percent. Where is Nifty50 headed? Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The Nifty has slipped further, moving lower from the 50 EMA, indicating increasing weakness. Bouts of selling pressure dragged the index to close at a several-day low. Market sentiment appears decisively negative. In the short term, the trend might remain weak, with potential downside towards 25,550–25,500. On the higher end, resistance is placed at 25,850. Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities Nifty continued to slide down on Friday and closed the day lower by 193 points. After opening on a weak note, the market slipped into further weakness that continued for better part of the session. Minor recovery was seen towards the end and Nifty closed near the lows. A long bear candle was formed on the daily chart with minor lower shadow. Technically, this market action indicates a sharp down trended movement in the market. A long bear candle was formed on the weekly chart that signals sharp reversal in the market after the consolidation movement of few weeks. This is not a good sign and indicates more weakness in the coming week. The underlying trend of Nifty continues to be weak. A slide below the support of 25700 could open more decline down to 25400 in the coming week. Immediate resistance is placed at 25900. Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Market sentiment stayed subdued amid elevated geopolitical and global trade-related concerns, particularly renewed uncertainty around potential U.S. tariff actions and related Supreme Court developments. Persistent foreign institutional selling and weakness across broader risk assets further compounded the negative bias, while heavyweights also added to the downside pressure. From a technical perspective, the decline has disrupted the short-term up move in the Nifty, with the index now retesting its medium-term support zone near the 100 DEMA around the 25,600 level. A decisive break below this could invite further pressure towards the 25,450 and 25,300 levels. On the upside, reclaiming the short-term moving average, i.e., the 20 DEMA around 26,000, may prove challenging. In the current environment, a selective approach with controlled position sizing and balanced exposure on both sides is advisable.

Wall Street’s risk-on fever shows no signs of abating in new year,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/wall-street-s-risk-on-fever-shows-no-signs-of-abating-in-new-year-13766424.html,"Wall Street’s risk complex is booming anew. In the first full week of 2026, a synchronized cross-asset rally — from meme stocks and high-yield bonds to small-company shares — shows no sign of slowing. US stocks closed at all-time highs, marking a heady start to the year, fueled by signs of fresh economic momentum, productivity gains and a benign inflation outlook. That backdrop has powered advances in cyclical sectors, commodities and speculative assets alike. No single event triggered the move. But a run of stronger-than-expected data has helped shape a growing sense that economic conditions are improving. It’s a view echoed by strategists at the likes of Nomura Securities International, who cite resilient employment, rising shipping rates and firm auto demand, among other factors, as drivers of the shift. Investors are moving out of last year’s safe bets and tech giants into riskier parts of the market that typically lead in early economic upswings. Even without firm signals on major policy questions — from Trump-era tariffs to the Federal Reserve’s next move — markets rallied sharply on the week. Shares tied to industrial growth jumped. Metal prices climbed. And demand for semiconductors — used in cars, appliances and factory equipment — remains strong, suggesting broad economic vigor. The rally has also been fueled by Washington. President Donald Trump unveiled new support for the housing market, giving fresh momentum to already-strong credit and property sectors. “It really doesn’t work to be overly defensive,” said Julie Biel, portfolio manager at Kayne Anderson Rudnick. “There’s too much sugar coming into the economy.” Still, buoyant speculative spirits — three years into a bull market in which the S&P 500 has nearly doubled — strike some as oddly timed. The good cheer seems wishful, said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading. “You have Intel up 10% and registering new highs because the CEO met with the president,” said O’Rourke, who also pointed to Friday’s run-up in mortgage originators following Trump’s plan to bolster credit markets. “On a daily basis stocks are rising 10% to 20% on tertiary news developments or the recycling of themes that have been playing out for months.” Investors’ hunger for risk has been visible across the board. The S&P 500 gained 1.6% this week and the Russell 2000 jumped 4.6%. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) attracted $10 billion in just a few days — a blistering pace for a passive fund. A meme-stock ETF soared nearly 15% while a basket of the most-shorted companies advanced 7%. Credit markets joined in. Junk bond spreads narrowed by 10 basis points, juicing fresh corporate borrowings. Even some memecoins — long seen as a bellwether for speculative excess — are rebounding after last year’s collapse. “The broadening is justified given the better economic data, especially with respect to more sectors and countries across the world performing well,” said Sameer Samana, head of global equities and real assets at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. “We are still a little skeptical on going too far down the market-cap stack.” Rather than confining themselves to a handful of all-weather tech megacaps, investors are betting on real economic strength. Industrial production is picking up. Car sales beat expectations in December, even as dealership inventory shrank and automakers offered fewer discounts — a sign of firm demand. US services activity expanded in December at the fastest pace in more than a year, defying gloomier readings elsewhere. Labor productivity rose at the fastest rate in two years, helping to contain employment costs. And in semiconductors, long a proxy for industrial demand, Microchip Technology raised its forecast, citing stronger-than-expected sales of chips that power the physical economy. “Accommodative monetary policy along with robust fiscal support continues to provide a favorable backdrop,” said Nathan Thooft, chief investment officer at Manulife Investment Management, which oversees $160 billion. “We are expecting economic activity to improve in the second quarter and beyond in 2026 driven by the previously mentioned drivers, the lag effect of monetary stimulus, and tax refunds benefiting the lower income cohort.” While Friday’s employment report spurred another bout of buying in stocks, the data was soggy enough to keep some market observers from declaring a full-blown revival in growth. Nonfarm payrolls rose by just 50,000 last month, missing forecasts, after the prior two months were revised lower, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. The unemployment rate edged down to 4.4%, settling back after the record-long government shutdown. “I don’t think I would go as far as to say ‘re-acceleration’ in the economy, since hiring trends are still weak,” said Priya Misra, a portfolio manager at JPMorgan Asset Management. “However, GDP of 2-3% and a stable unemployment rate this year should be cheered by markets.”"
How smart money trades before the Budget: Shubham Agarwal,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/expert-columns/how-smart-money-trades-before-the-budget-shubham-agarwal-13765221.html,"January stands apart as the most intriguing month for traders. Two forces shape the market during this period: quarterly results and the Union Budget tabled on February 1. After New Year, Foreign Institutional Investors start positioning themselves ahead of the budget. Traders at every level begin placing their bets on policy decisions, armed with whatever knowledge or information they possess. The timing of these positions varies wildly. It depends on your experience and how well you read participant behavior before budget season. During January, market trends blur. Indices and stocks throw fake breakouts. Whispers of budget policies create optimism about various sectors, triggering strong sector rotation. Money flows from one sector to another, creating sharp rallies in stocks but weak follow-throughs. Most of the time, the market remains range-bound. The question becomes: how do you trade this chaos? In January, option prices turn expensive. Consider this example. On January 1st, 2025, weekly ATM options (both Call and Put) with 9 days to expiry traded at Rs 200-220. Near budget time, January 28th, 2025, similar weekly ATM options with 9 days to expiry jumped to Rs 350-360. This expensive nature stems from higher expected volatility. Market participants anticipate larger moves due to budget policy decisions. Retail traders buy both Calls and Puts, creating huge demand. As demand rises, options become costlier than normal. So what should you do? Price movements turn erratic before the budget. But one thing stays clear: option prices become expensive (Volatility increases). You can benefit from this by going long straddle, buying an ATM Call and Put. This works in your favor if options become expensive (volatility rises) or if the market makes a bigger directional move. What's the risk? You cannot predict exactly when options will become expensive. You need to analyze past data to figure out the probable timing. The biggest risk is daily option price decay, also known as theta decay. The longer you stay in the trade, the more premium erodes. If you don't get the volatility rise within 3 days, take the loss and exit, or keep a suitable stop loss. For directional traders, stick to short-term trades. Book profits whenever they appear. Don't expect big positional moves. What not to do? Avoid pure short straddles and strangles in January. These strategies carry unlimited risk potential, especially when options are expensive. The second rookie mistake: buying an ATM Call and Put 1 or 2 days before the budget, hoping for a huge move on budget day. By that time, options have already peaked in price or sit near peak levels. Straddle buying at this stage produces negative outcomes most of the time. Here's the key insight: smart money doesn't try to forecast the market or predict policy decisions during budget time. Instead, they observe patterns. They watch how retail traders behave, how positioning builds up, and how volatility evolves through the month. From these observations, they build consistent, repeatable strategies. They don't gamble on outcomes. They bet on behavior.

"SPARC targets $10 million cost savings, consolidates R&D ops in Vadodara site",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/sparc-targets-10-million-cost-savings-consolidates-r-d-ops-in-vadodara-site-13765996.html,"Sun Pharma Advanced Research Company (SPARC) is cutting costs and optimizing R&D amid a portfolio pivot to high-value oncology and immunology assets, targeting $10 million in annual savings while managing $46 million in debt, according to company's recent investor call. The company is consolidating its operations in Vadodara, with US headcount slashed by over 80 percent, labs reduced from four to two sites, and overall workforce dropping 40 percent to around 246 by FY27 from 409 in FY24, driving R&D spend down to $14.3 million in FY25 from $20.4 million previously. SPARC, which focused on drug discovery and development, is backed by Dilip Shanghvi and his family and has synergies with parent Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, while also relying on revenue from out-licensed products. The long R&D cycles require significant investment and occasional borrowing or cost optimization. This hybrid captive-outsourced model extends the cash runway through FY27-28 via promoter-backed debt and internal accruals against a $125 million debt limit, while deprioritizing Vodobatinib in a competitive Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) landscape to free resources for modular platforms. CML is a slow-growing blood cancer of the bone marrow ​ SPARC's R&D optimization emphasizes business model flexibility, including NewCo Tiller Therapeutics for SCO-155 SMDC (potential 55% equity stake) and early licensing for seven assets, narrowing from a post-PROSEEK focus to 10 prioritized programs leveraging cost-effective Indian trial infrastructure.

"Gokaldas, Avanti Feeds, other export-oriented shares in focus ahead of US Supreme Court ruling on Trump's tariffs",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/gokaldas-avanti-feeds-other-export-oriented-shares-in-focus-ahead-of-us-supreme-court-ruling-on-trump-s-tariffs-13765153.html,"Shares of Gokaldas Exports, Avanti Feeds, Pearl Global Industries among other export-oriented firms were in focus in Friday’s trade ahead of a key ruling by the US Supreme Court on President Donald Trump’s use of emergency powers to impose tariffs. The case will decide whether Trump can invoke the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to levy tariffs without congressional approval. During arguments in November, the justices indicated scepticism over Trump’s authority to impose such duties. Analysts said export-linked stocks could see a rally if the court strikes down the tariffs, though they cautioned that alternative policy measures could limit the upside. Ajit Mishra, senior vice-president (research) at Religare Broking, said export-oriented stocks had seen a recent rebound on expectations of relief from the US Supreme Court. ""However, we believe market participants should temper their expectations, as the US government has planned other legislative measures to maintain or even raise tariffs in the event of an adverse ruling. Moreover, the recent weakness in broader markets further underscores the need for caution at current levels,"" Mishra added. Trump Tariffs Supreme Court Hearing Date Today Over 900 lawsuits had been filed in the US Supreme Court on behalf of businesses seeking tariff refunds, according to a tally compiled by Bloomberg. Company executives, customs brokers and trade lawyers are now bracing for the ruling, which can open up the possibility of obtaining perhaps $150 billion in refunds from the US government for duties already paid by importers in case Trump loses. Why $150 billion refunds are at stake Shares of Gokaldas Exports rose nearly 3 percent to Rs 642.5 on the NSE. More than 60 percent of the company’s revenue comes from the US market. According to BSE Analytics data, the stock is down nearly 41 percent over the past one year. KPR Mill shares fell 3 percent to Rs 826.7, while Pearl Global Industries gained about 2 percent to Rs 1,522. Avanti Feeds shares declined more than 2 percent, and Apex Frozen Foods fell nearly 6 percent to Rs 260.25. Sunny Agrawal, Head of Fundamental Research at SBI Securities, said ""The overhang of Trump’s tariffs is likely to continue on export-related businesses such as Gokaldas, Avanti Feeds, among others."" ""Today’s U.S. Supreme Court hearing can have multiple takeaways. In the first scenario, the U.S. Supreme Court strikes down Trump’s tariffs. In that case, the U.S. President can challenge the ruling, and the tariffs may continue for a longer period, so the overhang remains. In the second scenario, there is no clear ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court; in that case, too, the tariffs continue on all such businesses. In the third scenario, the U.S. Supreme Court gives a decision in favour of Trump’s tariffs; in that case as well, tariffs may continue on all export-led Indian businesses. I think that in all three scenarios, the overhang will continue until India and the U.S. formally come together to roll back the extra tariffs that the U.S. has imposed on India for importing Russian crude oil."" These stocks have seen sharp volatility in recent months as they derive a large portion of their revenues from the US market. The pressure intensified after Trump raised tariffs on Indian imports to 50 percent, citing India’s purchase of Russian oil. Shares also reacted to Trump’s approval to move forward with a bipartisan sanctions bill proposing a 500 percent tariff on countries continuing to do business with Russia, including India, China and Brazil.

"Trump's new tariff threat isn't a market killer, but OMCs could be vulnerable, say experts",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trump-s-new-tariff-threat-isn-t-a-market-killer-but-omcs-could-be-vulnerable-say-experts-13765267.html,"Indian equities, which had started calendar year 2026 on a cautious but stable note, suffered a sharp setback on January 8, triggered by concerns over potential US trade action linked to Russia-related sanctions, According to market participants, the sell-off erased an estimated Rs 8 lakh crore off investor wealth in a single session, marking the sharpest single-day drop in nearly four months. Nifty 50 dosed at 25,876.85, down 1.01% while Sensex fell 0.92% to 84,180.96. in broader markets, Nifty Midcap 100 declined 1.98% while India VIX spiked, signaling rising near-term volatility. Analysts are, therefore, factoring in about 2% of fall in markets because of this knee jerk reactions, while suggesting investors to buy this dip. Sectoral impact Public sector units (PSUs) and metal stocks led the decline. BHEL was down 8.78%, Hindalco declined 3.78% while ONGC fell over 3%. Among IT stocks, Wipro was down 3.3%. Selective gainers included ICICI Bank and Dixon Technologies, showing buying interest in high-quality domestic-consumption stocks, persistent with 2025's market sentiments including the milestone GST cut. Markets reacted to reports that US President Donald Trump had backed the Sanctioning Russia Act, a bipartisan bill proposing tariffs of up to 500% on countries continuing to import Russian oil or uraniurn. India, as the world's second-largest buyer of discounted Russian crude, was explicitly highlighted. Who takes the first hit ""If tariffs are imposed, which is still a low-probability outcome, the first balance sheet impact will fall on PSU oil marketing companies. Their costs would rise as they are forced to buy non-Russian crude at higher prices. They cannot pass on the full increase to consumers, resulting in margin compression and under-recoveries,"" said one of the analysts on an off-record basis. With Russian crude accounting for over 35% of imports, India's next step would be to shift onto costlier alternatives, such as from Brazil, and West Asia. Regarding crude economics, ""Indian refiners are already diversifying, but when discounts are around $5 to 6 per barrel, the economics of the deal dominate. Based on shipping flow data, a fall below roughly $4, will weaken the risk-reward ratio materially."" He goes on to add, ""Structurally, Indian refiners are positioned to handle bad-quality crude, so logistics and supply chain issues are not a concern."" Analysts also believe that at the moment, the market is pricing risk exposure, not an operational breakdown. ""The setback is not an oil supply shock, India has enough refining capacity and can process diverse crude grades. The only disadvantage is the loss of arbitrage from discounted Russian oil. Structurally, Indian refiners are positioned to handle bad-quality crude, so logistics and supply chain issues are not a concern,"" said Shailendra Kumar, CIO and co-founder of Nanolia He doesn't expect immediate impacts on broad macro indicators or the trade deficit. ""Brent crude price could rise modestly, say $60 to $75 per barrel, but this is not calamitous. The market may overprice the risk in the short term,"" he added. Analysts point out the real risk drivers Secondary points of friction are shipping insurance, trade finance, and dollar settlement channels. The sectors they are exposed to are PSUs, metal stocks, energy-linked names. Valuation gaps: Mid-cap and small-cap segments remain vulnerable into 2026, while large-cap indices have already absorbed prior corrections. ""The first quarter could see front loaded volatility. Mid-and small-cap stocks may correct 6 to 7% before stabilising. By April, once earnings and trade clarity emerge, markets could recover to 15 to 16% year-on-year gains,"" Kumar said. Analysts find it likely that if push comes to shove and Russian crude has to be reduced further, discounted Venezuelan crude could enter India's sourcing mix in limited volumes, provided sanctions are lifted. Buffering factors While sentiments might extrapolate on US playing a significant role as an export destination for India, it accounts for 18% of India's exports. Given India's strong macro fundamentals, domestic consumption-led sectors (FMCG, banks, infrastructure) remain largely insulated. Further, factoring in the possible risks will also open doors to diversification opportunities across Middle East, ASEAN, and Europe. Thus, acting as shock absorbers. ""Markets are currently more sensitive to headlines than fundamentals, Long term, India's economy od corporate earnings growth are healthy, Short-term volatility is a risk pricing exercise, not a structural breakdown, highlighted another industry analyst. ""Long-term fundamentals are intact. Short-term volatility is front-loaded; markets may reboutid once clarity on sanctions and trade treaties emerges,"" remains Kumar's stance. Upcoming events to monitor US Supreme Court / Senate hearings on the Sanctioning Russia Act (expected in February). Arrival of new US ambassador to India (January 12), expected to clarify the US stance. India-European trade treaty developments (possible February signing), which could reduce perceived geopolitical risk.

Eternal shares rise 3% after Goldman Sachs says 'we disagree over extent of bearishness',https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/eternal-shares-rise-3-after-goldman-sachs-says-we-disagree-over-extent-of-bearishness-13765065.html,"Eternal shaers rose more than 3 percent in intraday trade on Friday after global brokerage Goldman Sachs reiterated its “buy” rating on the stock. On the National Stock Exchange (NSE), the stock climbed 3.3 percent to an intraday high of Rs 292.90 per share. This marked the third straight session of gains for the stock. The rally followed Goldman Sachs reiterating its positive stance on Eternal, saying it disagreed with the extent of bearishness being priced into the online food-delivery firm’s stock. Eternal has declined about 17 percent over the past three months, compared with a 3 percent rise in the benchmark indices. Goldman Sachs maintained its “buy” rating on the company but trimmed its price target to Rs 375 from Rs 390 earlier. Eternal is the parent company of food delivery platform Zomato and quick-commerce firm Blinkit. The brokerage said the recent 14.6 percent sell-off in the stock during the October–December period, compared with a 6.2 percent gain in the Nifty 50, reflected concerns over heightened competition and expectations of a slowdown in quick commerce. ""We disagree with the extent of bearishness being priced into ETEA,"" Goldman Sachs said.

The XUV7XO comes with multiple feature upgrades, including best-in-class suspensions, a threescreen display layout, ambient lighting options, enhanced ADAS and electronics and computing system, Dolby Vision with Dolby Atmos, a 16-speaker Harman Kardon setup, and superior seating. We believe this model can add about 2-3k incremental units to the monthly run-rate of XUV700. For XE9S, while most of the interiors for this model are similar to the ICE variant, it features semi-active suspension and an AR Heads-up Display. Beyond these models, the company plans to launch two more ICE variants in FY27, alongside an EV in the same fiscal. This healthy launch pipeline is expected to help sustain strong demand momentum going forward. Outlook We expect Mahindra and Mahindra (MM) to deliver a 14% UV volume CAGR over FY25-28E.

Despite persistent softness in the industry, APAT registered 11% YoY volume growth in 9MFY26 and maintains FY26 volume growth guidance of 10-15%, supported by capacity expansion in the high-growth region (Dubai), new strategy of launching a sub-premium brand ‘SG Premium’ and healthy private-sector demand across infrastructure, solar, and manufacturing.

BHEL shares rebound over 3 percent today in early trade after sharp sell-off; order win helps stock,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/bhel-shares-rebound-over-3-percent-today-in-early-trade-after-sharp-sell-off-order-win-helps-stock-13764674.html,"Shares of Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (BHEL) recovered sharply in early trade on Friday, rising over 3 percent, as the stock rebounded a day after a sharp selloff triggered by policy-related concerns. The stock was trading at Rs 280.75, up 3.31 percent in early deals. The recovery follows Thursday’s nearly 9 percent decline, when BHEL had hit the lower circuit intraday after reports suggested India may ease curbs on Chinese firms bidding for government contracts -- sparking a broad sell-off across capital-goods stocks. Buying interest returned on Friday after UBS initiated a ‘Buy’ call on BHEL with a target price of Rs 375 per share, implying over 35 percent upside from Thursday’s closing levels. The brokerage cited strong order momentum and improving execution visibility as key reasons for its positive stance. UBS highlighted BHEL’s Rs 5,400-crore coal gasification and raw syngas cleaning plant order from BCGCL, a joint venture between Coal India and BHEL. The project, for a coal-to-ammonium-nitrate plant, marks the first commercial deployment of BHEL’s proprietary Pressurised Fluidised Bed Gasification (PFBG) technology, with a 42-month execution period and 60-month operations and maintenance tenure. Also read | Volatile markets slow sovereign funds, global central banks investments in India during 2025 Friday’s rebound also reflects selective buying in beaten-down capital-goods stocks after Thursday’s sharp correction, which had weighed on peers such as Siemens, ABB India and L&T. Despite the recent volatility, BHEL shares remain up about 28 percent over the past one year, significantly outperforming the Nifty 50’s roughly 10 percent gain. The company had a market capitalisation of about Rs 94,700 crore at the previous close.

"Buy or Sell NHPC stock? CLSA’s ‘high-conviction outperform’ call hinges on FY26 capacity jump, earnings",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-or-sell-nhpc-stock-clsa-s-high-conviction-outperform-call-hinges-on-fy26-capacity-jump-earnings-13764628.html,"Shares of NHPC Ltd are likely to remain on investors’ radar after CLSA issued a ‘high-conviction outperform’ call on the stock, citing a sharp step-up in capacity and a decisive improvement in earnings visibility from FY26. The brokerage has set a target price of Rs 117 per share, implying an upside of over 42 percent from Thursday’s closing level of Rs 82. NHPC stock call: CLSA says capacity expansion to aid jump in profit At the heart of CLSA’s bullish view is its expectation that FY26 will mark an inflection point for NHPC’s scale and growth trajectory. The brokerage believes the company’s installed capacity could rise by as much as 64 percent year-on-year in FY26, setting the stage for a stronger earnings profile over the medium term. CLSA expects this expansion phase to translate into a sharp improvement in profitability. The brokerage projects nearly 90 percent growth in earnings per share over FY25-27. The brokerage added that FY26 should solidify NHPC’s decadal growth story as long-pending projects begin contributing meaningfully. Recent corporate actions have also added to investor interest in the stock. NHPC’s board has approved fund-raising of up to Rs 2,000 crore through the issuance of non-convertible, non-cumulative AH-Series bonds in one or more tranches via private placement, as part of its FY26 borrowing plan. The move is seen as strengthening the company’s financial flexibility ahead of a heavy execution phase and has been one of the triggers behind recent activity in the stock. Also read | Indian Gold ETFs see $1.25 billion inflows in December, highest ever A key operational catalyst highlighted by CLSA is the full commissioning of the Subansiri Lower Hydro Project -- NHPC’s second-largest project -- by the fourth quarter of FY26. Beyond this, the brokerage expects the award of four hydropower projects and one pumped storage project during 2026, which could further strengthen visibility on long-term growth. NHPC’s recent stock performance has been relatively muted -- up about 5 percent over the past year compared with a roughly 10 percent rise in the Nifty 50. However, CLSA sees NHPC as a scale-up and execution-led opportunity.

What to do with BHEL stock today after a sharp selloff? UBS says ‘buy’ on major order win; check target price,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/what-to-do-with-bhel-stock-today-after-a-sharp-selloff-ubs-says-buy-on-major-order-win-check-target-price-13764551.html,"Shares of Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (BHEL) will be in focus in Friday’s trade after UBS issued a ‘Buy’ call with a target price of Rs 375 per share, following a sharp selloff triggered by policy-related concerns. UBS’ target price implies over 35 percent upside from Thursday’s closing level. The brokerage’s positive stance comes on the back of strong recent order wins and improving execution visibility, UBS said. BHEL shares had crashed nearly 9 percent on Thursday, hitting a 10 percent lower circuit intraday, after a Reuters report said India is considering scrapping five-year-old restrictions on Chinese companies participating in government tenders. The stock closed at Rs 276.9, wiping out a part of recent gains. However, it remains up about 28 percent over the past one year, well ahead of the Nifty 50’s roughly 10 percent rise. BHEL stock call: Brokerage view positive after recent correction UBS said the recent correction offers a positive read-through for the stock, citing robust order momentum. The brokerage highlighted that BHEL has secured a Rs 5,400-crore coal gasification and raw syngas cleaning plant order, taking its FY26 order inflows to around 60 percent of full-year expectations. The order has been awarded by BCGCL, a joint venture between Coal India and BHEL, for a coal-to-ammonium-nitrate project, marking the first commercial deployment of BHEL’s proprietary Pressurised Fluidised Bed Gasification (PFBG) technology. UBS noted that this represents a shift for the company from R&D to large-scale execution, with a 42-month execution period and 60-month operations and maintenance tenure, strengthening long-term revenue visibility. Also read | Indian Gold ETFs see $1.25 billion inflows in December, highest ever The brokerage’s note comes against the backdrop of heightened investor activity after reports that easing restrictions on Chinese bidders could intensify competition in large government contracts, particularly in power and railways. These concerns had triggered a broad sell-off across capital-goods stocks on Thursday, dragging down peers such as Siemens, ABB India and L&T. However, looking past near-term policy uncertainty, UBS said that BHEL’s improving order book, technology differentiation and execution pipeline place it in a stronger position after the recent decline. BHEL had a market capitalisation of about Rs 94,700 crore at the previous close.

About 2,470 shares declined compared to 439 shares that gained on the NSE. The market is expected to consolidate with range-bound trading after the sharp correction. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Aakash Shah, Research Analyst at Choice Broking Alkem Laboratories | CMP: Rs 5,793 On the daily chart, price action in Alkem Laboratories has formed a descending channel, indicating a corrective move within a broader uptrend rather than a trend reversal. The recent strong bullish candle has broken above the upper trendline of the channel, signalling a resumption of bullish momentum. The stock is trading above the 20 EMA and 50 EMA, both of which are sloping upward, reflecting strengthening short-term and medium-term momentum. The price is also comfortably placed above the 100 EMA and 200 EMA, confirming that the broader trend remains bullish and structurally intact. Volume has expanded on the breakout, supporting the validity of the move, while volumes were relatively muted during the consolidation phase — a classic sign of healthy price digestion before continuation. From a momentum perspective, the RSI is trending above 60, indicating bullish strength without entering extreme overbought territory, leaving room for further upside. Structurally, the Rs 5,550–5,600 zone now acts as a key support area, aligning with the breakout level and short-term moving averages. As long as Alkem holds above this zone, the bullish breakout remains valid and favours continuation toward the Rs 5,900–6,050 resistance zone in the near term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 6,050 Stop-Loss: Rs 5,550 Supriya Lifescience | CMP: Rs 765 On the daily chart, price action in Supriya Lifescience is forming a rising channel, indicating higher lows and sustained buying interest after the prior impulse move. The recent bounce from the lower boundary of the channel near Rs 720–730 reflects demand absorption and signals continuation potential. The stock is trading above the 20 EMA and 50 EMA, both of which are gradually turning upward, reflecting improving short-term momentum. The price is also holding above the 100 EMA and 200 EMA, confirming that the broader trend remains positive and structurally strong. Volume expanded during the earlier breakout toward the Rs 800 zone, while the current consolidation phase is accompanied by relatively lower volumes, highlighting healthy price digestion rather than distribution. Momentum indicators remain neutral to positive, with the RSI holding above 50, suggesting a bullish bias with scope for further upside as momentum builds. Structurally, the Rs 730 zone acts as a key demand and support area, aligning with the rising trendline and short-term moving averages. As long as Supriya holds above this zone, the bullish structure remains intact and favours continuation toward the Rs 800–830 resistance zone in the near term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 830 Stop-Loss: Rs 730 Emcure Pharmaceuticals | CMP: Rs 1,521.8 On the daily chart, Emcure is indicating a sequence of higher lows and steady accumulation after a breakout from its consolidation phase. The recent breakout above the upper range of consolidation near Rs 1,470–1,500 reflects renewed buying interest and strengthens the continuation outlook. The stock is trading comfortably above its key EMAs, all of which are positively aligned and sloping upward. This EMA structure confirms strong short-term momentum as well as a healthy medium-to-long-term trend, suggesting sustained bullish strength. Volume activity expanded during the recent upside breakout, while prior consolidation phases were marked by relatively muted volumes, indicating healthy price digestion rather than distribution. From a momentum perspective, the RSI is trending above 65, indicating bullish strength without entering extreme overbought territory, leaving room for further upside. From a structural perspective, the Rs 1,430–1,450 zone acts as an important support area, aligning with the short-term EMAs and the prior breakout level. As long as Emcure holds above this support band, the bullish structure remains intact and favours further upside toward the Rs 1,580–1,650 resistance zone in the near term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,650 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,430 Om Mehra, Technical Research Analyst at Samco Securities Indus Towers | CMP: Rs 430.85 Indus Towers continues to trade in an upward sequence, forming higher highs and higher lows on the daily chart. The stock is holding comfortably above its key moving averages and remains aligned with the rising Supertrend zone, which continues to act as a reliable support. Recent candles near the Rs 425 area are providing a cushion for the short-term correction. The daily RSI is placed near 61, remaining in the higher zone and indicating sustained strength without any signs of exhaustion. The rate of change indicator also remains in positive territory, supporting the continuation of the ongoing trend. Volumes have remained steady and strong during the advance, suggesting healthy participation. The broader outlook remains favourable. A sustained move above Rs 435 could open the path for further upside toward higher levels. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 458 Stop-Loss: Rs 414 Ramco Cements | CMP: Rs 1,082.5 Ramco Cements has gradually improved its short-term trend and is now holding above its rising 20-day moving average, while the 50-day average near the Rs 1,040 zone continues to act as a strong base. The stock has been forming higher lows over the past few weeks and is consolidating just below the Rs 1,080–1,090 resistance band. The daily RSI is placed near 64, indicating sustained strength. The MACD continues to move higher and is in positive territory, supporting the ongoing recovery phase. Volumes have remained steady, suggesting measured participation. As long as the stock holds above Rs 1,055, the near-term outlook remains positive. A sustained move above Rs 1,090 could open the path for further upside. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,160 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,040 Endurance Technologies | CMP: Rs 2,611.2 Endurance Technologies is inching higher after a prolonged corrective phase and is now attempting to build a base above the Rs 2,550–2,580 zone. The stock is trading close to its short-term moving average and has started forming higher lows on the daily chart. The long-term 200-day moving average remains near the Rs 2,450 area, providing a broader support base. The daily RSI, currently around 42, has moved higher from lower levels, pointing to a gradual improvement in momentum. The MACD remains below the zero line but is flattening, suggesting that downside pressure is easing. Volumes have remained slightly muted but may pick up in the coming sessions.

The Nifty slipped near the 25,850 mark intraday, weighed down by broad-based selling across sectors, persistent foreign institutional investor (FII) outflows, concerns over potential US tariffs, and rising geopolitical tensions. Tracking weak global cues, domestic markets opened on a subdued note, with the Nifty hovering around 26,100. However, sustained profit booking through the session dragged the index to intraday low at 25,858.45. At close, the Sensex was down 780.18 points or 0.92 percent at 84,180.96, and the Nifty was down 263.90 points or 1.01 percent at 25,876.85.

Click to View More Outlook for January 9 Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The Nifty has slipped below its rising trendline, clearly indicating a sudden increase in bearish bets. Additionally, the index has moved below 26,000, which had been acting as a psychological support. More importantly, the Nifty has closed below the 50 EMA for the first time in three months, signifying a bearish shift in the trend. A rising India VIX is also pointing to increased panic among market participants. Overall, the setup looks uncomfortable for the bulls. Selling pressure is likely to persist in the near term unless the Nifty moves back above 26,000. On the downside, the index might fall down towards 25,700 and 25,550. Rajesh Bhosale, Equity Technical Analyst, Angel One Once again, the market opened on a negative note, and unlike the previous few sessions, the sell-off intensified as the day progressed. Nifty eventually ended with a sharp cut of around 1%, closing tad below the 25900 mark. Nifty slipped for the fourth consecutive session, thereby erasing all the gains made in the previous week. The bullish Symmetrical Triangle breakout witnessed last Friday now stands negated, as prices slipped below last week’s low. Additionally, the index has seen a bearish breakdown from the rising trendline connecting the higher bottoms of November and December, along with a close below the 50-DEMA, which had acted as a strong support over the past couple of months. The coming session will be crucial, as sustained trading below the 25900 level could open the door for further downside in the week ahead. The next key support is placed around 25700, which marks the December swing low and coincides with the 89-DEMA, followed by 25500, a key retracement level. On the upside, the 26000–26100 zone, coinciding with the 20-DEMA, is seen as immediate resistance, and unless the index regains this zone, the market may continue to remain under pressure. Amid ongoing geopolitical tensions and fresh tariff-related concerns, a broad-based sell-off was witnessed in the midcap space, which had earlier marked its highest close on Wednesday and was showing strong momentum until then. Volatility is likely to remain elevated in the near term, and traders are advised to avoid aggressive positions until there is better stability and clarity on global cues.

BHEL hits 10% lower circuit as report says India may ease curbs on Chinese firms bidding for govt contracts,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/bhel-hits-10-lower-circuit-as-report-says-india-plans-to-scrap-curbs-on-chinese-firms-bidding-for-govt-contracts-13763636.html,"BHEL shares hit 10 percent lower circuit limit in January 8 trade after a report said that India plans to scrap curbs on Chinese firms bidding for government contracts. Consequently, shares of Bharat Heavy Electricals hit 10 percent lower circuit to quote at Rs 273.20 apiece. The shares settled at Rs 276.90 per share, down 8.78 percent. The sharp decline was witnessed after a Reuters report that the finance ministry plans to scrap five-year-old restrictions on Chinese firms bidding for government contracts as New Delhi seeks to revive commercial ties in an environment of eased diplomatic and border tensions. BHEL builds, commissions, and supplies equipment for numerous thermal power plants across India, including large supercritical projects (800 MW+), playing a key role in India's energy security by manufacturing turbines, generators, and boilers for state-owned entities like NTPC and private players like Adani Power. Meanwhile, Siemens shares fell over 4% as China's CRRC is also competitor to them in Railway contracts, which could be now allowed to participate in Rail contracts if recommendations of committee are approved as the article suggests. The restrictions had a significant impact wherein months after they were unveiled, China's state-owned CRRC was disqualified from bidding for a $216-million train-manufacturing contract. The curbs, imposed in 2020 after a clash between the countries' troops, required Chinese bidders to register with an Indian government committee and obtain political and security clearances. Other capital goods stocks like Hitachi Energy, ABB India fell 4-4.5%. Shares of blue chip firm L&T fell nearly 3%. The measures effectively barred Chinese firms from competing for Indian government contracts that were estimated to be worth $700 billion to $750 billion. ""Officials are working to remove the registration requirement for bidders from bordering nations,"" one government source told Reuters, declining to be named as they were not authorised to speak publicly. The Ministry of Finance's plan to ease curbs followed requests from other government departments that are facing shortages and project delays due to the 2020 restrictions. ""Several ministries have requested exemptions to overcome the constraints that could derail projects in their sectors,"" a second government source told Reuters. Curbs on imports from China of equipment for the power sector have hindered India's plans to raise its thermal power capacity to about 307 GW over the next decade. A high-level committee headed by a former cabinet secretary, Rajiv Gauba, has also recommended easing the restrictions. Gauba is now a member of a top government think tank.

The stock declined 3.85 percent to an intraday low of Rs 820.85 per share on the National Stock Exchange. In a notice, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) accused a Bank of America (BofA) unit of violating insider trading norms and breaching internal information barriers, commonly known as ""Chinese walls"", in connection with a March 2024 share sale of Aditya Birla Sun Life Asset Management. The notice followed Sebi’s investigation into the conduct of the bank’s domestic securities unit in managing the transaction. According to the regulator, the bank’s deal team, while in possession of unpublished price-sensitive information related to the share sale, contacted potential investors directly or indirectly. At the request of the deal team, the bank’s broking arm, research team and Asia-Pacific syndicate team reached out to investors and shared valuation reports and other confidential information, the October 30-dated notice said. “The conduct highlights the failure of the deal team to maintain Chinese walls with broking and research arms, impacting safekeeping of confidential information and internal controls,” Sebi said. The regulator further alleged that the bank suppressed material facts and made false statements during the course of the investigation.

"LG Electronics shares fall 4% after 3-month lock-in expiry, down 18% since listing: What lies ahead",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/lg-electronics-shares-fall-4-after-3-month-lock-in-expiry-down-18-since-listing-what-lies-ahead-13763313.html,"The shares of LG Electronics India fell more than 4 percent on January 8 after the three-month shareholder lock-in period came to an end. The shares of the electronics major fell to Rs 1,393.20 apiece, the lowest level seen by the stock since listing. LG Electronics' three-month lock-in period expires: Around 1.52 crore shares, or approximately 2 percent of the company's outstanding equity, have become eligible for trading after the expiry of the lock-in period, CNBC-TV18 quoted Nuvama Alternative and Quantitative Research as saying. The said number of shares will be cumulatively worth around Rs 2,214 crore based on the stock’s previous closing price of Rs 1,456.40 per share. However, this does not imply that all these shares will be offloaded in the market immediately. The expiry of the lock-in period simply means that these shares can now be traded. LG Electronics bumper market debut: The stock had made a strong market debut on December 10, listing at Rs 1,710.10 apiece on NSE. This marked a premium of 50 percent from the IPO price of Rs 1,140 per share. This came after the Rs 11,607-crore IPO of the company was subscribed more than 54 times. The stock is currently around 18 percent lower than its listing price. What lies ahead? LG Electronics India is investable in the long term owing to sound fundamentals, said Nitant Darekar Research Analyst at Bonanza. The company is a prominent player in the market for products, like washing machines in which it has 33.4 percent of the market share and in refrigerators it has 29.9 percent of the market share. ""The Rs 5,000 crore Sri City investment over 4-5 years signals conviction in capacity expansion and export optionality under the Global South strategy. While Q2 FY26 EBITDA margins compressed to 8.9% from 12.4% due to GST transition disruptions, commodity inflation, and promotional investments, management expects recovery through localization (targeting 70% from current 55.8%), premiumization, AMC recurring revenue, and B2B expansion,"" he explained. With the GST cut digested, healthy Rs 4,280 crore liquidity and strong brand momentum entering festive season, the long-term outlook supports sustained market share gains and margin normalization, though near-term volatility warrants patience, the analyst said. However, LG Electronics may see near-term volatility with the three-month lock-in period ending today, said Dr. Ravi Singh, Chief Research Officer at Master Capital Services. In Q2 FY26, the company reported a 27 percent YoY decline in net profit, despite a 1 percent increase in revenue. The analyst however explained that from a long-term market perspective, the outlook remains constructive. The stock’s strong IPO response and premium listing highlighted investor confidence in LG’s brand strength, market leadership, and India-focused strategy, he said. ""Because of premiumization, growing appliance penetration and export opportunities, management has consistently positioned India as an important growth market. Importantly, LG is gradually expanding beyond pure hardware by building non-hardware revenue streams such as subscriptions, digital platforms, and webOS-based services, which can structurally improve margins and earnings over time. Therefore, LG Electronics continues to be a strong long-term investment option supported by structural demand factors despite short-term volatility,"" Singh said.

"TCS, TechM, other IT shares fall up to 3% ahead of Q3 results; brokerages expect another tepid quarter",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/tcs-techm-other-it-shares-fall-up-to-3-ahead-of-q3-results-brokerages-expect-another-tepid-quarter-13762835.html,"Shares of major information technology firms fell up to 3 percent in intraday trade on Thursday amid broad-based selling in the sector ahead of the December quarter earnings season. Tata Consultancy Services led the decline, slipping as much as 3 percent, while Oracle Financial Services Software dropped up to 2 percent. Wipro and Tech Mahindra fell 2.14 percent and 2.07 percent, respectively. Coforge, Mphasis, LTIMindtree and Persistent Systems were also trading lower, declining up to 2 percent. Nine out of the 10 constituents of the Nifty IT index were in the red. The profit booking comes ahead of the start of the third quarter earnings season on January 12, when Tata Consultancy Services and HCLTech are scheduled to announce their results. Brokerages expect another muted quarter for Indian IT firms as weak demand in the United States and holiday-period client shutdowns continue to weigh on technology spending. On average, the top six IT firms by revenue are expected to report about 4 percent year-on-year revenue growth and a 5 percent rise in profit for the December quarter, compared with revenue growth of 6.5 percent in the September quarter, according to nine brokerages. Indian software exporters last reported double-digit revenue growth in the March quarter of 2023, when demand for digital transformation, cloud adoption and remote working surged in the post-pandemic period. The $283-billion Indian IT industry continues to face macroeconomic headwinds, including uncertainty over US tariffs, concerns over proposed visa fees and subdued client spending amid worries about economic growth in the United States. The US remains a key market for Indian IT firms, accounting for a significant share of their revenue. Sector bellwether Accenture recently beat Wall Street expectations on AI-led demand, but maintained its growth outlook, indicating a cautious near-term environment. Although India does not have pure-play AI companies, IT firms are shaping AI strategies through acquisitions and partnerships. Brokerages expect AI-related momentum to build over the next six months, with demand improving into 2026. Foreign investors pulled out a record USD 8.5 billion from IT stocks in 2025 due to tariff uncertainty, visa concerns and weak spending, accounting for nearly half of total foreign outflows from Indian equities. The Nifty IT index fell 12.6 percent in 2025, making it the worst-performing sector as Indian markets underperformed Asian and emerging market peers. Tata Consultancy Services is expected to report about 4.2 percent year-on-year revenue growth for the December quarter, slower than the 5.6 percent growth reported in the same period last year. Infosys and HCLTech are forecast to post revenue growth of about 8.1 percent and 4.6 percent, respectively, compared with 7.6 percent and 5.1 percent a year ago. Most brokerages do not expect HCLTech to revise its fiscal 2026 revenue growth guidance of 2–3 percent, or Infosys to raise its forecast of 3–5 percent.

The shares of these export-oriented stocks have seen significant volatility recently, since Trump took office and hiked tariffs on Indian imports to 50 percent, citing New Delhi's purchase of Russia oil. Textile and shrimp stocks: Gokaldas Exports shares crashed nearly 13 percent to trade at Rs 596.65 apiece. The stock later recovered some losses to close 8 percent lower in the red. Revenue from U.S. accounts for more 60 percent of the overall revenue for the company, whose shares fell more than 34 percent in 2025 amid Trump's tariff flipflops. K.P.R. Mill shares fell more than 4 percent. Pearl Global Industries shares meanwhile dropped around 8 percent. Apex Frozen Foods shares fell nearly 8 percent, while Avanti Feeds shares dropped nearly 9 percent. The shares of these export-oriented companies significantly declined as they derive a significant portion of their revenue from the American market. 500% US tariff on India? Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said that the bill would give US an added leverage over countries ""fueling Putin’s war machine"" by purchasing Russian oil. ""This bill would give President Trump tremendous leverage against countries like China, India, and Brazil to incentivise them to stop buying the cheap Russian oil that provides the financing for Putin's bloodbath against Ukraine,"" Aljazeera quoted Lindsey Graham, a senator for the US state of South Carolina as saying. He added that the legislation, cleared by Trump, could be taken up for a bipartisan vote as early as next week, as diplomatic efforts to end the war in Ukraine continue. US Congress website shows that the proposed legislation, titled the Sanctioning of Russia Act 2025, would also impose penalties on individuals and entities, and sharply increase duties on all goods and services imported from Russia into US to a minimum of 500 percent, signalling a significant escalation in economic pressure. According to Graham, the bill would give the US president broader authority to penalise countries purchasing discounted Russian oil, which Washington argues is helping finance Moscow’s war in Ukraine. “This bill will allow President Trump to punish those countries that buy cheap Russian oil, fueling Putin’s war machine,” he said, naming China, India, and Brazil as potential targets. After a very productive meeting today with President Trump on a variety of issues, he greenlit the bipartisan Russia sanctions bill that I have been working on for months with Senator Blumenthal and many others. This will be well-timed, as Ukraine is making concessions for peace… — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) January 7, 2026 This comes as the much-awaited trade deal between India and US still remain elusive, despite several efforts and meetings between officials from both sides. ""I have a very good relationship with PM Modi, but he is not happy with me as India is paying high tariffs. But now they have reduced it very substantially, buying oil from Russia,"" Trump said recently. India has rejected claims that Prime Minister Narendra Modi promised to stop buying Russian oil, maintaining that its energy purchases are guided by national interest and energy security.

The Nifty Metal index fell nearly 3 percent to a one-week low of 11,215 in the morning trading hours of Thursday, recording the worst single-day percentage drop since April 2025 Why are metal stocks declining? The sharp fall in the metal stocks may have been driven by profit booking in base metals. Copper, aluminium, gold and silver saw a massive surge recently, before beginning to decline as investors may have resorted to profit booking at elevated levels. Silver futures on MCX declined up to Rs 4,000 per kilogram, while gold, aluminium and copper futures fell around 1 percent each. “Precious metals faced profit-taking ahead of commodity index rebalancing,” said Devarsh Vakil, Head of Prime Research at HDFC Securities. Citi said that based on combined Bloomberg Commodity Index and S&P GSCI data, along with its proprietary estimates for index assets under management, gold is likely to see outflows of about $6.8 billion, while silver could witness outflows of roughly $6.8 billion as well during the annual rebalancing exercise, CNBC-TV18 reported. Stocks in this sector were seeing profit-booking after a recent rally, Anshul Jain, technical analyst at Laxmi Shri Securities, said. Metal stocks: Hindustan Zinc shares were the top loser on the index, falling more than 5 percent as silver prices extended decline. National Aluminium Company (NALCO) tumbled around 5 percent. Jindal Stainless Steel, Jindal Steel & Power, Vedanta and Hindustan Copper shares fell around 4 percent each, while Hindalco Industries, NMDC, Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL), JSW Steel and Tata Steel shares fell more than 2 percent each. Notably, Tata Steel on Wednesday said its India operations manufactured a record high quantity of crude steel in the December quarter, at 6.34 million tonnes, up over 11 percent from 5.69 million tonnes produced in the year-ago quarter. The production growth was attributed to higher output at Tata Steel's Jamshedpur and Kalinganagar factories. APL Apollo Tubes, Adani Enterprises and Welspun Corp shares fell more than 1 percent each. Prior to the decline in the current session and yesterday, the Nifty Metal index had risen for six consecutive days, during which it gained almost 5 percent. The index ended flat on Wednesday. It has surged over 11 percent in the last 30 days, but has seen a muted performance in seven prior trading sessions. Follow all LIVE updates from the stock markets here."
"Hindustan Zinc shares tumble 5% as silver price drops below Rs 2.5 lakh/kg, silver ETFs fall 3%",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/hindustan-zinc-shares-tumble-5-as-silver-price-drops-below-rs-2-5-lakh-kg-silver-etfs-fall-3-13762716.html,"The shares of Hindustan Zinc tumbled on January 7 as silver prices extended decline, falling up to Rs 4,000 per kilogram within an hour. Silver ETFs also dropped, mirroring the fall in the precious and industrial metal. Hindustan Zinc shares dropped nearly 5 percent to a near three-week low of Rs 599.25 apiece, extending decline for the second consecutive session. The company is the largest producer of silver in India, and produces refined silver with a minimum 99.9 percent purity. Silver prices tumble: Silver futures with March expiry on the Multi Commodity Exchange of India (MCX) fell more than Rs 3,000 to Rs 2,47,529 per kilogram. This comes after the contracts hit fresh lifetime high of Rs 2,59,692 per kg earlier yesterday. Futures with May expiry fell more than Rs 3,300 to Rs 2,54,876 per kilogram. The future contracts with July expiry meanwhile fell over Rs 4,000 to Rs 2,62,399 per kilogram. The sharp fall may have been driven by profit booking, while a stronger dollar weighed on sentiment across precious metals ahead of key U.S. jobs data due this week. Silver ETFs: Silver exchange traded funds (ETFs) mirrored the fall in silver prices. Edelweiss Silver ETF, HDFC Silver ETF, UTI Silver ETF, Axis Silver ETF, Zerodha Silver ETF, Groww Silver ETF, Tata Silver ETF, SBI Silver ETF, DSP Silver ETF, Aditya Birla Silver ETF, Mirae Asset Silver ETF, Nippon Silver ETF and ICICI Prudential Silver ETF were down more than 3 percent each. Kotak Silver ETD, Motilal Oswal Silver ETF and 360 ONE Silver ETF meanwhile fell nearly 3 percent each, extending sharp decline for the second consecutive session. Hindustan Zinc share price: Hindustan Zinc shares fell more than 3 percent in the past five days, but gained 22 percent in the past one month. The stock jumped 37 percent in the past six months. What should investors do? Silver shows higher volatility than gold showing a bubble-like behavior, Aggarwal from VSRK Capital said. ""Strategy entry can be planned when prices stabilise near support zones with market sentiment improving but consider that metals tend to remain choppy for years after a strong rally,"" he added. Looking ahead to 2026, the medium-term outlook remains constructive, especially for silver, Harshal Dasani, Business Head, INVasset PMS said, adding that the structural industrial demand linked to electronics, solar and electrification remains strong, while supply constraints have persisted for several years, keeping the market in deficit. ""Silver, in particular, had become a momentum trade in 2025, rising sharply over the year, which made it vulnerable to profit-booking and leveraged unwinds once sentiment turned. Gold, too, delivered outsized gains over the past year, so even routine corrections appear severe when they follow such a strong run,"" Dasani said. In the near term, price direction will continue to be influenced by the US dollar and real interest rates—any repricing toward higher yields tends to pressure non-yielding assets like gold and silver, while softer yields and risk aversion restore their appeal, according to the analyst.

"Meesho shares fall 5% for 2nd day after lock-in expiry, Rs 40,000 crore wiped off from m-cap since Dec high",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/meesho-shares-fall-5-after-gm-business-resigns-rs-40-000-crore-wiped-off-from-m-cap-since-dec-high-13762618.html,"The shares of Meesho dropped another 5 percent on January 7 to near its listing price, extending losses to the second day after the firm's one-month shareholder lock-in period expired. The shares of the company dropped to Rs 164.90 apiece on Thursday, extending losses for the third consecutive session. The stock has now fallen more than 35 percent from its December high of Rs 254.40 apiece, wiping off more than Rs 40,000 crore from the newly-listed company’s market capitalization. In an exchange filing, Meesho announced that Megha Agarwal, General Manager – Business and a Senior Management Personnel of Meesho, on January 7 has tendered her resignation. Subsequently, Milan Partani, General Manager - User Growth and Content Commerce and Senior Management Personnel, will assume the role of General Manager – Commerce Platform. Lock-in expiry: Earlier yesterday, the stock hit the 5 percent lower circuit after the one-month shareholder lock-in period came to an end. Around 10.99 crore shares, or approximately 2 percent of the company's outstanding equity, have become eligible for trading after the expiry of the lock-in period, CNBC-TV18 quoted Nuvama Alternative and Quantitative Research as saying. The said number of shares will be cumulatively worth around Rs 2,002.82 crore based on the stock’s previous closing price of Rs 182.24 per share. However, this does not imply that all these shares will be offloaded in the market immediately. The expiry of the lock-in period simply means that these shares can now be traded. Meesho's bumper market debut: The stock had made a strong market debut on December 10, listing at Rs 162.50 apiece on NSE. This marked a premium of more than 46 percent from the IPO price of Rs 111 per share. This came after the Rs 5,421-crore IPO of the e-commerce platform was subscribed 79 times. The stock is currently around 32 percent higher than its listing price. How have Meesho shares performed since listing? After listing, the stock sharply jumped 65 percent to hit a high of Rs 254.40 apiece on December 18, before losing steam. The stock has so far declined 35 percent since then, and is nearing its listing price. What lies ahead? Meesho has significantly improved its logistics efficiency over the last few years, said Abhinav Tiwari, Research Analyst at Bonanza, who noted that the e-commerce platform's cost per order reduced from Rs 55 in FY23 to Rs 46 in FY25. ""This improvement came from building its own logistics platform called Valmo and improving delivery density. At the same time, cash on delivery orders have reduced from more than 90% earlier to about 61% in the first half of FY 2026, which further helps reduce delivery failures and costs. Valmo has also increased delivery reliability in smaller towns, which supported the reduction of failed and repeat deliveries. By improving logistics without heavy subsidies, Valmo lowered operating risk and strengthened cash flows, making the business more capital efficient and closer to profitability,"" he said. Despite these operational improvements, the stock has been under pressure recently. The key reason today is the expiry of the IPO lock in period, which has increased the supply of shares in the market and led to selling by early investors and pre-IPO shareholders. ""In addition, the stock had been trading at elevated valuation multiples compared to other consumer internet and retail peers, prompting profit taking. This lock in related supply, combined with broader risk off sentiment toward high valuation new age stocks, has resulted in valuation de rating, even as the underlying business performance remains largely intact,"" Tiwari said.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Varun Beverages, Kalyan Jewellers, Persistent, Birlasoft, BSE, and others on January 8?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-varun-beverages-kalyan-jewellers-persistent-birlasoft-bse-and-others-on-january-8-13762292.html,"Equity benchmarks remained under pressure for three consecutive sessions, with the Nifty 50 falling 38 points on January 7 amid neutral market breadth. About 1,465 shares advanced compared to 1,402 declining shares on the NSE. The market is likely to consolidate further with a negative bias. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Nilesh Jain, Head – Technical and Derivatives Research Analyst (Equity Research) at Centrum Broking Varun Beverages | CMP: Rs 509.7 Varun Beverages has recently witnessed a breakout from a symmetrical triangle pattern on the daily chart and has also moved above its 200-DMA, placed near Rs 485, which is now expected to act as immediate support. The breakout is supported by higher-than-average volumes, reinforcing the bullish outlook. Additionally, the stock is trading comfortably above both its short-term and long-term moving averages, indicating strong underlying momentum. From a derivatives perspective, the build-up of fresh long positions further strengthens the positive bias. Considering the overall technical setup, the stock appears well-positioned to move towards the Rs 555 level in the near term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 555 Stop-Loss: Rs 485 Kalyan Jewellers India | CMP: 520.75 Kalyan Jewellers is forming a strong base and has recently witnessed a breakout from a multi-month falling trendline. The sharp price up-move is backed by significantly higher volumes, which validates the bullish setup. Additionally, the stock has reclaimed its long-term 200-DMA, placed around Rs 518, further strengthening the positive structure. Momentum indicators are also supportive, with the RSI moving above the 60 mark and the MACD generating a bullish crossover, indicating improving upward momentum. Overall, the technical structure suggests the stock is well-placed to move towards the Rs 580 level in the near term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 580 Stop-Loss: Rs 490 Jio Financial Services | CMP: Rs 303.5 Jio Financial Services has formed a strong base after taking support at its 200-DMA, currently placed near the Rs 295 level. It has also formed a bullish engulfing candlestick pattern on the daily chart, signalling a potential bullish reversal. The recent price action is supported by higher-than-average volumes, which further strengthens the positive outlook. Additionally, a fresh bullish crossover on the MACD indicates improving momentum. On the downside, immediate support from the rising trendline is placed around the Rs 290 level. With these technical factors in place, the stock appears well-positioned to break out of the triangle pattern and move towards the Rs 330 level in the near term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 330 Stop-Loss: Rs 290 Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical and Derivatives Research at SBI Securities Persistent Systems | CMP: Rs 6,513.5 Persistent Systems has formed a strong bullish candle on the daily chart, highlighting a resurgence in buying momentum. The 50-day EMA continues to act as a reliable dynamic support, with the stock repeatedly testing and holding this zone since December. The Persistent/Nifty IT ratio chart has delivered a consolidation breakout, indicating potential outperformance versus its sector. Momentum indicators remain supportive, with the RSI settling slightly above 60 and DI+ crossing above DI– on the ADX. With prices approaching a key resistance zone, the overall setup suggests a breakout could be imminent. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 6,520–6,470 with a stop-loss of Rs 6,290. On the upside, it is likely to test the Rs 6,970 level in the short term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 6,970 Stop-Loss: Rs 6,290 Manappuram Finance | CMP: Rs 319.9 Following a decisive breakout above its downward-sloping trendline on December 19, Manappuram Finance witnessed a strong follow-through rally over the next three sessions. The stock then consolidated in a tight Rs 319–305 range and formed a Bullish Flag pattern. On Wednesday, the stock delivered a flag breakout, reflecting renewed buying interest. A rising ADX signals strengthening bullish momentum, while prices remain comfortably above key moving averages. Given the constructive consolidation and improving momentum, the stock appears well-placed to extend its ongoing up-move in the near term. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 320–317 with a stop-loss of Rs 308. On the upside, it is likely to test the Rs 340 level in the short term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 340 Stop-Loss: Rs 308 Birlasoft | CMP: Rs 443.4 Birlasoft broke out of its downward-sloping trendline on December 2 and witnessed a strong follow-through move, rallying above its 200-day EMA and advancing towards the Rs 459 level. Subsequently, profit-booking pulled the stock back to the 200-day EMA, a key long-term trend indicator that often acts as a strong demand zone. A sharp rebound on Wednesday, with the stock closing over 5.25 percent higher, signals fresh buying interest. The DI+ crossover above DI– on the ADX reflects strengthening bullish momentum, while a close above the Bollinger Band midline further reinforces the positive near-term outlook. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 445–440 with a stop-loss of Rs 430. On the upside, it is likely to test the Rs 475 level in the short term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 475 Stop-Loss: Rs Rs 430 Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities BSE | CMP: Rs 2,744.9 BSE has broken out of a downward consolidation on the daily chart, signalling a shift in momentum. The price continues to hold above the 21 EMA, and both the 21 EMA and 50 EMA are in a bullish crossover. Additionally, the RSI is in a bullish crossover and trending higher. In the short term, the stock may continue to remain strong, with upside potential towards Rs 2,900. Support is placed at Rs 2,684, below which a correction cannot be ruled out. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,900 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,684 Bharat Petroleum Corporation | CMP: Rs 368.2 BPCL has slipped from its recent rising consolidation, pointing towards emerging weakness. The decline has been accompanied by healthy volumes, indicating active selling pressure. The RSI has also broken down from consolidation, reinforcing the bearish view.

The sharp rise in the share prices pushed the Nifty India Defence index up 0.65 percent to 7,973.95. US planning to acquire Greenland? The White House on January 6 announced that US President Donald Trump is discussing options to acquire Greenland, including potential use of the US military. Trump sees Greenland’s acquisition as a US national security priority which is needed to ""deter our adversaries in the Arctic region,"" the White House said in a statement. ""The president and his team are discussing a range of options to pursue this important foreign policy goal, and of course, utilizing the U.S. military is always an option at the commander-in-chief's disposal,"" the White House said. Greenland has repeatedly said that it does not wish to be part of the United States.

IIFL Capital shares rise amid buzz of US PE firm TPG Capital picking up to 20% stake,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/iifl-capital-shares-rise-amid-buzz-of-us-pe-firm-tpg-capital-picking-up-to-20-stake-13761473.html,"IIFL Capital Services shares settled nearly 1 percent higher on Wednesday amid market buzz that US private equity firm TPG is in talks to acquire up to a 20 percent stake in the company.

The stock has gained around 5 percent over the last three sessions. The buying interest was driven by reports that TPG is looking to enter India’s capital markets and wealth management space through an investment in IIFL Capital. “Various modalities of a possible deal are being worked out,” said a person familiar with the matter. According to a Moneycontrol report, TPG is currently carrying out due diligence on IIFL Capital. It is understood that TPG is in talks to acquire some or all of the stake held by Fairfax, which owns about 27 percent of IIFL Capital through FIH Mauritius Investments. The discussions also include a possible infusion of fresh capital into the company. The transaction, if concluded, could result in TPG acquiring a minimum stake of around 20 percent in IIFL Capital.

Weight-loss injection launch: The recent surge in the stock price comes on weight-loss injection boost. Earlier in November, Emcure announced that it has become the first Indian company with exclusive rights to distribute and commercialise Poviztra, semaglutide injection 2.4 mg, for weight loss in India. This comes as it entered into a strategic partnership with Novo Nordisk India. Later in December, Emcure announced the commercial launch of the weight-loss injection. 'Strong bullish breakout from consolidation phase' Emcure Pharmaceuticals has witnessed a strong bullish breakout from its consolidation phase, supported by a clear surge in volumes, indicating fresh buying interest and improving market participation, said Drumil Vithlani, Technical Research Analyst at Bonanza. He added that the stock is now comfortably trading above all key moving averages, reflecting a positive shift in trend and strength after decisively breaching the earlier resistance zone of Rs 1,500. According to the analyst, this will likely act as the immediate support in case of any pullback from the recent rise. 'Outlook remains positive': “Momentum indicators remain supportive, with RSI hovering in the bullish zone without showing signs of exhaustion. Overall, the outlook remains positive, and the stock is well placed for a buy-on-dips approach near the ₹1,480– 1,500 zone, with near-term upside potential towards ₹1,580–1,620, while the broader trend stays intact as long as prices hold above ₹1,450,” Vithlani said.

Click to View More Outlook for January 8 Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The Nifty remained volatile during the session, though the real range stayed relatively small. On the lower end, it found support at the 21 EMA before closing higher. In the near term, the trend is likely to remain sluggish, with the range placed between 26000 and 26300. Any decisive fall below 26000 may trigger further weakness. On the other hand, a decisive move above 26300 would require for a directional upmove in the Nifty. Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical and Derivatives Research at SBI Securities Nifty began the session on a weak note and attempted a recovery but faced strong resistance twice near the 26,180–26,190 zone, leading to a gradual decline. The index staged a steady recovery in the second half from the day’s low of 26,069 but eventually ended the day 0.14% lower at 26,140. Since hitting an all-time high of 26,373 on 5th January, Nifty has posted consecutive doji candles on the daily chart. However, despite intraday choppiness, Index managed to close above its 20-day EMA, indicating underlying support remains intact. Going ahead, for Nifty, the 50-day EMA zone of 25,950-25,900 will act as an immediate support. Any sustained move below the 25,900 level could lead to Index extending its weakness further down towards the 25,800 level, followed by 25,700. On the upside, the zone of 26,200-26,250 will act as an as immediate resistance and move above 26,250 could lead to continuation of up move in the Index.

He explained that this suggest a weak trend for the stock in the short-term. “The stock has formed a lower top and a lower bottom in the chart. This suggests strong sale pressure on the stock.

"2026 will see improvement in earnings growth; IT, consumption, materials are 'dark horses':  ABSL AMC's Harish Krishnan",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/2026-will-see-improvement-in-earnings-growth-it-consumption-materials-are-dark-horses-absl-amc-s-harish-krishnan-13761305.html,"Indian equity markets are entering a phase of “reboot, refresh and reclaim”, with opportunities shifting decisively from crowded themes to selective, company-specific bets, said Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC co-CIO and head of equities Harish Krishnan. He also cautioned against over-owned small caps and pointed to an earnings-led cycle beginning in 2026. Speaking at the fund house’s annual market outlook presentation, Krishnan said the easy gains of the post-pandemic rally are behind the market. “In 2023 and 2024, it was a rising tide that lifted all boats. Luck was getting rewarded, and many people thought it was skill,” he said. Large Caps in focus: Krishnan also noted that while the profit pool share of India’s top 100 companies has returned close to long-term highs, ownership has shifted aggressively toward mid- and small-cap stocks. “Close to 30–35% of mutual fund houses today have higher exposure to mid and small caps than to large caps,” he said. “There has been a significant amount of money chasing small caps over the last three to four years. That bus does look overcrowded,"" he added. While earnings may continue to grow in smaller companies, he warned that elevated ownership and stretched valuations limit upside. “That is why we continue to believe there is far greater opportunity in the larger companies than going small and micro,” Krishnan said. He added that opportunities are becoming selective rather than broad-based. “Good companies are scarce today compared to the previous cycle, which is why valuations have got mainstreamed. Opportunities are not everywhere, but there are pockets where one can still make reasonably good money.” Earnings Recovery: On earnings, Krishnan said 2025 has been a difficult year marked by single-digit growth, but conditions are in place for improvement. “We do think CY26 will be better than CY25,” he said, clarifying that the key driver will be an acceleration in earnings rather than mere upgrades. He pointed to three tailwinds: monetary easing, fiscal support to consumers, and currency trends. Krishnan highlighted that nearly 55–60% of India’s corporate revenue pool is dollar-linked. “Think about IT services, pharma, auto ancillaries, metals, energy. These are very large revenue pools,” he said adding that a rupee depreciation actually lifts the revenue base for a lot of companies. However, he cautioned that foreign investors only turn constructive once the currency stabilises. “It is not the slide in the rupee that helps; it is when the rupee stops sliding that earnings start reflecting in a meaningful way,” he said. IPO Supply: Krishnan flagged the surge in equity supply as a key factor capping market returns. “If you include IPOs, OFS, QIPs, promoter sales and private equity exits, supply is annualising at close to 2% of market capitalisation,” he said. These numbers, he noted are very difficult for the market to digest. He added that IPO performance has deteriorated even as issuance volumes surged. “The weighted average return of IPOs has been coming down,” Krishnan said, noting that Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC has significantly reduced participation in new listings. “In the last 12 months, our IPO participation rate is about 22%. That means we have invested in roughly one out of every five IPOs,” he said. “Where there has been too much froth, we have consciously stayed away,"" he added. Sector View: IT, Consumption, Materials as ‘Dark Horses’ Using the fund house’s proprietary sector framework, Krishnan identified IT, consumption, and materials as “dark horse” segments where pessimism and low ownership could create alpha. “IT is one such space where everyone believes AI will dismantle the industry,” he said. “We agree the threat is real, but a lot of that fear is already priced in.” Consumption is another area where the firm is turning constructive after being underweight for nearly three years. “We are now moving into consumption as a theme,” Krishnan said, pointing to fiscal measures, tax cuts, and potential pay commission effects. Materials, including chemicals, building materials and consumer durables, form the third opportunity bucket. On the other hand, Krishnan said the fund house has been booking profits or staying underweight in industrials, capital goods, real estate and PSU-linked financials. “Capital goods was a space where we made a lot of money in 2023 and 2024. In the second half of 2025, we moved out,” he said. Follow all LIVE updates form the stock markets here."

DIL has been able to negotiate a favorable agreement with Yum!, in terms of significant cost waivers in PH, phased transition of key business functions like tech/supplychain management (SCM) for PH/KFC, and additional marketing/innovation rights for PH. Some of these new functions, though, will require new tech/team capabilities; DIL has already started investing in leadership gaps and shortlisted a global tech partner. Encouragingly, the expected synergy benefits of Rs2.10-2.25bn are net of these investments; 60% of the savings should likely accrue in FY28E itself, with the complete benefit expected in FY29E. With relaxed store targets in the new agreement along with cost waivers, DIL expects revival of the PH brand and return of double-digit brand contribution for the format (vs largely having achieved breakeven currently). Factoring in a sluggish demand environment, we cut our near-term earnings by 7-9%. Outlook However, rollover to Dec-27E earnings keeps the TP intact at Rs 190 (33x Dec27E EBITDA); we reiterate BUY on Devyani.

As many as 1.84 crore shares of HDFC Bank changed hands at an average price of around Rs 950 per share. The stock was trading at Rs 948.35, down 1.44 percent in intraday trade, adding to sharp losses over the past two sessions. HDFC Bank shares had fallen 1.6 percent on Tuesday and 2.4 percent on Monday, taking the cumulative price decline over the last two days to nearly 3.9 percent, before today’s fall. The recent weakness in the stock follows the lender’s Q3 FY26 business update, after which HDFC Bank emerged as one of the top drags on the benchmark indices. The stock slipped to its lowest level in more than three months earlier this week, reflecting investor caution despite steady headline growth numbers. Also read | TPG said to be in talks with IIFL Capital for stake acquisition In its provisional update, HDFC Bank reported a 9 percent year-on-year rise in average advances under management to Rs 28.64 lakh crore in the December quarter, compared with Rs 26.28 lakh crore a year ago. Period-end advances under management rose 9.8 percent year-on-year to Rs 29.46 lakh crore, while gross advances grew 11.9 percent year-on-year to Rs 25.43 lakh crore. However, brokerages flagged concerns around the pace of deposit accretion. While Motilal Oswal Financial Services retained a ‘Buy’ rating on the stock, citing healthy momentum in advances growth, analysts at Nomura pointed to slower deposit growth, noting that the credit-deposit ratio climbed close to 100 percent during the quarter. According to Nomura, stronger deposit inflows would be required for HDFC Bank to meaningfully accelerate loan growth in coming quarters. Despite the recent correction, HDFC Bank’s stock is up about 10.7 percent over the past year, marginally outperforming the Nifty 50. The bank’s market capitalisation currently stands at around Rs 14.58 lakh crore.

The shares of the company dropped to a near two-month low of Rs 703.30 apiece in the morning trading hours of Wednesday. Morgan Stanley on IHCL: Morgan Stanley has downgraded the shares of IHCL to 'equal-weight' from its earlier 'overweight' rating, and cut its target price to Rs 780 per share from Rs 811 apiece. The latest target price implies a upside potential of more than 7 percent from the stock's previous closing price of Rs 726.40 apiece. By leveraging the Taj brand, IHCL has created a hospitality ecosystem that delivers industry-leading return ratios and free cash flow, CNBC-TV18 quoted Morgan Stanley as saying. It added that while the industry revenue per available room cycle is strong, it may see limited upside surprises. The brokerage sees domestic hotel RevPAR growth of 9-10 percent in Q3 FY26; EBITDA up approximately 10 percent YOY. However, it cut FY26-28 EPS outlook by 2-3 percent due to slightly lower RevPAR estimates and margins. The international brokerage added that the enterprise value (EV)/earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of 27.5x for FY27, properly captures the risk-reward. IHCL Q2 Results: The Indian Hotels Company (IHCL) on November 4 reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 285 crore for the July-September quarter of the financial year 2026. This marks a 49 percent YoY decrease from the Rs 554.58 crore net profit reported in the same period last year, including a one-time gain.

"Meesho hits 5% lower circuit after lock-in expiry to trade near listing price, down 32% from Dec high",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/meesho-hits-5-lower-circuit-after-lock-in-expiry-to-trade-near-listing-price-down-32-from-dec-high-13760875.html,"The shares of Meesho dropped 5 percent to hit the lower circuit on January 7 after the one-month shareholder lock-in period came to an end. The shares of the ecommerce platform fell to Rs 173.13 apiece, extending losses for the second consecutive session to trade near its listing price of Rs 162.50 apiece. Meesho's one-month lock-in period expires: Around 10.99 crore shares, or approximately 2 percent of the company's outstanding equity, have become eligible for trading after the expiry of the lock-in period, CNBC-TV18 quoted Nuvama Alternative and Quantitative Research as saying. The said number of shares will be cumulatively worth around Rs 2,002.82 crore based on the stock’s previous closing price of Rs 182.24 per share. However, this does not imply that all these shares will be offloaded in the market immediately. The expiry of the lock-in period simply means that these shares can now be traded. Meesho's bumper market debut: The stock had made a strong market debut on December 10, listing at Rs 162.50 apiece on NSE. This marked a premium of more than 46 percent from the IPO price of Rs 111 per share. This came after the Rs 5,421-crore IPO of the e-commerce platform was subscribed 79 times. The stock is currently around 32 percent higher than its listing price. How have Meesho shares performed since listing? After listing, the stock sharply jumped 65 percent to hit a high of Rs 254.40 apiece on December 18, before losing steam. The stock has so far declined 32 percent since then, and is nearing its listing price. The company currently has a market capitalization of Rs 78,136 crore. What lies ahead? Meesho has significantly improved its logistics efficiency over the last few years, said Abhinav Tiwari, Research Analyst at Bonanza, who noted that the e-commerce platform's cost per order reduced from Rs 55 in FY23 to Rs 46 in FY25. ""This improvement came from building its own logistics platform called Valmo and improving delivery density. At the same time, cash on delivery orders have reduced from more than 90% earlier to about 61% in the first half of FY 2026, which further helps reduce delivery failures and costs. Valmo has also increased delivery reliability in smaller towns, which supported the reduction of failed and repeat deliveries. By improving logistics without heavy subsidies, Valmo lowered operating risk and strengthened cash flows, making the business more capital efficient and closer to profitability,"" he said. Despite these operational improvements, the stock has been under pressure recently. The key reason today is the expiry of the IPO lock in period, which has increased the supply of shares in the market and led to selling by early investors and pre-IPO shareholders. ""In addition, the stock had been trading at elevated valuation multiples compared to other consumer internet and retail peers, prompting profit taking. This lock in related supply, combined with broader risk off sentiment toward high valuation new age stocks, has resulted in valuation de rating, even as the underlying business performance remains largely intact,"" Tiwari said.

"Senco Gold, Kalyan Jewellers shares jump up to 14% after strong Q3 business updates",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/senco-gold-kalyan-jewellers-shares-jump-up-to-14-after-strong-q3-business-updates-13760766.html,"The shares of Senco Gold and Kalyan Jewellers India jumped in trade on January 7 after the companies released strong business updates for the third quarter of the financial year 2026. Senco Gold shares rallied 14 percent to Rs 368.4 apiece, while Kalyan Jewellers India shares jumped 7 percent to Rs 535 apiece. Senco Gold Q3 update: Senco Gold released its Q3 business update in the post market hours of January 6. The company recorded a 51 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in the October-December quarter of the ongoing FY26. This takes the total growth to 31 percent in the first nine months of FY26 (April-December), after 6.5 percent growth in Q2 and 28 percent in Q1. “Our TTM revenue has already reached ~₹8000 crore, reflecting consistent YoY growth, loyal customer base and brand positioning. The Q3 YoY growth includes retail business growth of ~49% and SSSG of ~39% growth. The 9-month topline growth of 31% includes SSSG of ~21% growth. This uplift was led by targeted festive campaigns, new design launches and intensive customer engagement during Dhanteras & Diwali, wedding buying and shift of demand of Q2 to the festive season. Diamond jewellery sales continued to maintain strong growth momentum in Q3 to ~36% YoY growth and 9-month growth of ~34%,” the firm said. During the quarter under review, Senco Gold launched 4 new franchise showrooms, taking the total showroom network to 196 (inclusive of 8 Sennes and 2 international showrooms). “We have successfully navigated the peak festive demand of Q3 and continue to optimise our inventory more towards a Lightweight and budget-friendly product range due to rising gold prices. We are prepared for the upcoming Q4 wedding season, Valentine's Day and International Women's Day, and other local festivals and targeting growth in the studded category through curated collections with 18%~20% growth,” it added. The company said that it is on course to achieve its annual target of 20 new showroom openings for FY26, and expects another 3 to 4 showrooms under the COCO and FOCO models to achieve the milestone of 200 showrooms and have a robust pipeline for H1 next year. Senco Gold is confident of achieving more than 25 percent YoY growth for FY26. Kalyan Jewellers Q3 business update: Kalyan Jewellers reported a consolidated revenue growth of approximately 42 percent YoY during Q3 FY26. The firm’s India operations witnessed revenue growth of nearly 42 percent during Q3 FY26 as against Q3 FY25, driven primarily by strong festive demand. “Demand during the period after Diwali also continued to remain robust despite volatility in gold prices. Growth was broad-based across plain gold and studded categories. The quarter recorded healthy same-store-sales-growth of approximately 27%,” the company said. Kalyan's international operations recorded revenue growth of approximately 36 percent for the recently concluded quarter when compared to the same period during the previous financial year. “Within the Middle East specifically, we witnessed revenue growth of approximately 28% for Q3 FY2026 as compared to Q3 FY2025 driven majorly by same-store-sales-growth. International markets contributed approximately 11% to our consolidated revenue for the recently concluded quarter,” the firm added. Spot gold prices rose nearly 12 percent during the quarter, to close out a calendar year in which the precious metal clocked its steepest rise since 1979, driven by geopolitical uncertainties, rate cuts and robust central bank buying. ""Higher prices did have an impact on volumes, but not on (overall) spending,"" said Dharmesh Kant, head of equity research at Cholamandalam Securities. Kant added that jewellery companies also benefitted from higher cash in the hands of people as a result of fiscal policies like GST cuts and income tax relief, as well as low inflation.

Why Wall Street’s surge isn’t good news for India anymore,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/why-wall-street-s-surge-isn-t-good-news-for-india-anymore-13760406.html,"US stocks have kicked off the year on a record high, powered by a renewed surge in technology and AI names, as investors bet that geopolitics may ultimately ease -- not tighten -- financial conditions. Wall Street’s rally gathered momentum after the US capture of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro was read by markets as reducing concerns around energy and geopolitics, reinforcing expectations that the Federal Reserve will have room to cut rates later this year. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq have both hit fresh all-time highs, with gains overwhelmingly concentrated in mega-cap technology, AI infrastructure and semiconductor stocks, extending a rally that has now run for nearly three years. That strength, however, is only accentuated a growing global divergence. And India sits firmly on the wrong side of it. The divide is at multiple levels: between AI and non AI markets, and then, between markets with weakening and stronger currencies, as US President Donald Trump has reset trade terms, and the dollar has turned decisively weak. This already played over the past year with India emerging as one of the weakest relative-return markets in the world. While US equities have delivered high-teens returns over the last 12 months, Indian benchmarks have struggled to keep pace, with gains stuck in single digits for the frontline indices, and several broader indices ending up flat to negative on a relative basis. India has also underperformed Japan and parts of emerging Asia, reversing the leadership position from earlier years when it was seen as a structural growth outlier. What does all this mean? Jefferies’ Asia strategy describes India as the clearest example of the “reverse AI trade” — a market that has remained largely disconnected from the global AI capex boom while continuing to trade at a premium to peers. Unlike the US, where AI-linked capex has directly lifted earnings visibility and market concentration, India has seen little direct earnings spillover from the theme. The result is an uncomfortable mix of elevated valuations, modest earnings growth, and declining foreign flows, just as global investors are once again being pulled back into US technology leaders. Foreign portfolio investor activity reflects that shift. As US tech stocks regain momentum, India has struggled to attract sustained incremental flows, relying increasingly on domestic institutions to stabilise markets. This is a model that works in drawdowns, as Indian investors so far have had a steadfast ‘buy-on-dips’ approach, but offers limited upside during global risk-on phases. This means that for Indian equities, the list of potential catalysts is narrow — and conditional. According to several global analysts, the most important trigger would be a clear pivot toward monetary easing in the US. A dovish Fed would weaken the dollar, loosen global liquidity and reopen the relative-value case for emerging markets, including India. Without that shift, India will find it difficult to compete with the earnings momentum and thematic clarity driving US stocks. The second lever is a visible improvement in earnings growth, led by domestic demand. A pickup in consumption, credit growth and private capex would help justify valuations that currently leave little margin for disappointment. If those conditions fall into place, select pockets of the Indian market could respond quickly. Rate-sensitive sectors such as banks, non-bank lenders, real estate and consumption-linked stocks would be the most immediate beneficiaries of a global and domestic easing cycle. Financials, in particular, will benefit from lower funding costs and improved loan growth, while discretionary consumption would benefit from easing inflation and stronger household demand. Until then, India may remain caught in a global market structure dominated by US technology and AI, and waiting for rate cuts, stronger demand, or both, to reclaim its leadership in global portfolios."
"Domestic institutions ramp up MF, insurance, AIF and pension investments in 2025; FIIs lag",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/mutual-funds-insurance-pension-assets-surge-in-2025-foreign-investors-trail-13760300.html,"India’s top domestic institutional investors reported a rise in assets during 2025, underscoring continued local support for equity and debt markets even as foreign investor assets grew at a slower pace. Mutual funds recorded the strongest increase, with equity assets rising 20.6 percent during the year to Rs 52.25 lakh crore from Rs 43.34 lakh crore a year earlier. Their combined equity and debt assets climbed 23.34 percent to Rs 73.21 lakh crore, compared with Rs 59.35 lakh crore last year. MF bought Indian equities worth around Rs 4.88 lakh crore during the year compared to Rs 4.3 lakh crore a year ago. Industry experts attributed the expansion to rising retail participation and sustained optimism in equities. They said growing financial awareness — amplified by social media and digital investment platforms — has made market participation more accessible. Insurance companies and local pension funds also expanded their allocations. Equity assets for insurers and domestic pension funds rose 12.6 percent and 66 percent year on year to Rs 26.81 lakh crore and Rs 4.38 lakh crore, respectively. Both insurance and national pension funds saw buying Indian equities worth over Rs 1.4 lakh crore during the year. Their combined equity and debt assets increased 12 percent and 20 percent to Rs 45.89 lakh crore and Rs 16.32 lakh crore. The rise was supported by continued investments and regulatory flexibility that has allowed higher equity exposure. In recent years, the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority has permitted pension managers to invest up to 75 percent of Tier-I assets and 100 percent of Tier-II assets in equities, widening the scope to participate in market growth. The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India has also allowed insurers to allocate part of their corpus to equities within prudential limits, while keeping substantial exposure in government and approved securities. Alternate investment funds and banks saw equity assets grow 37 percent and 33 percent, while their combined equity and debt assets rose 23 percent and 25 percent, respectively. Experts said rising allocations to AIFs reflect a preference among high-net-worth investors and family offices for focused, rules-based strategies aimed at generating outperformance. By contrast, foreign portfolio investor equity assets rose just 4.3 percent during the year to Rs 74.26 lakh crore, while their combined equity and debt exposure increased 4.8 percent to Rs 81.4 lakh crore. FIIs sold a net Rs 1.66 lakh crore in 2025 amid stretched valuations, subdued earnings, geopolitical worries, and concerns over steep tariffs on Indian exports. Equity assets for FDI investment, however, recorded a sharper rise, climbing 31.2 percent during the year to Rs 40.86 lakh crore. Combined equity and debt assets under FDI increased 30.6 percent to Rs 43.38 lakh crore."

Buffett vs real estate: The 5-second stock deal that explains why he still bets on equities,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/buffett-vs-real-estate-the-5-second-stock-deal-that-explains-why-he-still-bets-on-equities-13760251.html,"Warren Buffett has once again made the case for equities over property, saying real estate investing is slower, more complex, and less efficient than buying stocks, especially at scale. The comments come from a resurfaced video of Buffett speaking at the 2025 annual meeting of Berkshire Hathaway, months after he stepped down as the firm’s chief executive on December 31, ending a three-decade run at the helm. Speed and simplicity over negotiation Buffett said real estate deals demand prolonged negotiations, extensive documentation, and the coordination of multiple parties, making them fundamentally different from equity investments. “In real estate, every sentence matters,” Buffett said, referring to contracts and deal structures. By contrast, stock transactions can be executed almost instantly if the price is right. He pointed to Berkshire’s own experience, noting that while the company did pursue real estate opportunities during the 2008–09 financial crisis, the time and effort involved were disproportionate to the potential returns compared with securities. Liquidity as the deciding factor Buffett highlighted liquidity as a decisive advantage. Large equity transactions can be completed in seconds, while real estate deals can take weeks or months to close. This distinction matters most during periods of market stress, when speed and flexibility can determine outcomes. Distressed real estate assets may occasionally trade at attractive prices, Buffett acknowledged, but stocks have historically offered better value with far less friction. Where Charlie Munger differed and agreed Buffett noted that his longtime partner Charlie Munger enjoyed real estate investing and completed several deals later in life. Still, Buffett argued that if forced to choose early on, Munger would have picked stocks for their scalability and efficiency—suggesting that even real estate enthusiasts recognise the structural advantages of equities."

Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Amol Athawale, VP Technical Research at Kotak Securities Pidilite Industries | CMP: Rs 1,505 On the daily scale, post correction from higher levels, Pidilite Industries was trading in a range-bound mode. However, it has delivered a range breakout along with decent volumes. Therefore, a close above the resistance line indicates that further bullish momentum could continue in the coming period. For positional traders, Rs 1,455 would be the decisive level. Trading above this level, the uptrend formation may continue towards Rs 1,600. However, if the stock closes below Rs 1,455, traders may prefer to exit long positions. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,600 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,455 Life Insurance Corporation of India | CMP: Rs 850 Post its downward trend, LIC is in an accumulation zone, where it has been trading in a range-bound mode on the daily scale. However, recent bullish activity in the stock is indicating good strength. The stock is expected to break out of the range and witness bullish momentum from the current levels with a favourable risk-reward perspective. For the next few trading sessions, Rs 820 could be the trend-decider level for the bulls. If it sustains above this level, further upside towards Rs 910 can be expected. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 910 Stop-Loss: Rs 820 Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities Sun Pharmaceutical Industries | CMP: Rs 1,760.2 After showing weakness in the last few weeks, Sun Pharma has witnessed a sharp upside breakout so far this week amid a volatile broader market. The stock price moved above the crucial resistance of the 10- and 20-week EMAs on Tuesday and closed higher. Hence, there is a higher possibility of a further extension of upside momentum in the coming week. Volumes have started to expand during the upside breakout in the stock price, and the weekly 14-period RSI shows positive indications. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,905 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,685 Emcure Pharmaceuticals | CMP: Rs 1,528 Emcure Pharma has witnessed a sharp breakout so far this week. The larger consolidation has been decisively surpassed around Rs 1,470, with the stock closing higher. The weekly candlestick pattern indicates a change in sentiment towards bullishness.

Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,655 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,458 NAVA | CMP: Rs 611.2 After showing range-bound action over the last few weeks, NAVA has witnessed a decisive upside breakout at the Rs 440 level so far this week and closed higher. The weekly candlestick pattern indicates a decisive upside breakout of the larger consolidation pattern. The larger positive sequence of higher tops and higher bottoms remains intact as per the weekly timeframe chart. Volumes expanded on Tuesday during the breakout in the stock price, and the weekly 14-period RSI shows positive indications. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 660 Stop-Loss: Rs 580 Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors Fortis Healthcare | CMP: Rs 945 On the daily chart, Fortis Healthcare has been moving under the formation of a rounding bottom pattern since November 2025. In the previous session, the stock surged more than 3% and also closed above the neckline at Rs 941, confirming the breakout of the pattern. Also, over the past four trading sessions, prices have not closed below the previous day’s low, which confirms strength in the ongoing trend. The stock also closed above the 50 EMA (Exponential Moving Average), which is a positive sign. For now, one can use dips as a buying opportunity for a move towards Rs 985, followed by Rs 1,030 levels. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 985, Rs 1,030 Stop-Loss: Rs 895 Aurobindo Pharma | CMP: Rs 1,231.3 At the start of this month, Aurobindo Pharma took support near its 60-day EMA and has since resumed an upward move, forming a clear higher-high and higher-low structure. The stock is currently on the verge of a breakout from an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, indicating a potential bullish trend reversal. In the previous session, prices closed with gains of 2%, reflecting strong buying interest. Also, the MACD has shown a bullish crossover, with a green histogram forming above the zero line, which is acting as a double confirmation. A decisive breakout above the neckline resistance of Rs 1,242 can confirm the pattern breakout and push prices higher towards the pattern target of Rs 1,320 or beyond. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,320 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,190 Tata Consumer Products | CMP: Rs 1,210.4 Tata Consumer Products has been respecting an upward-sloping trendline since August 2025. Recently, prices once again took support near this trendline and rebounded by more than 4%, underlining its significance. In the previous session, the stock decisively broke above its prior swing high of Rs 1,202 and closed with gains of 2.39%, clearly indicating that bulls remain in control. Along with this, the ADX is trading near 29, suggesting strengthening bullish momentum in the stock. For now, a buy-on-dips strategy appears prudent to ride the ongoing trend, with upside targets of Rs 1,250 followed by Rs 1,280. On the downside, Rs 1,165 remains a crucial support level, which also coincides with the rising trendline. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,250, Rs 1,280 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,165"

The sharp rise in the share prices pushed the Nifty Pharma index nearly 1.7 percent to 23,126.85 on Tuesday. “Pharma stocks advanced due to the consistent growth reported by the Indian Pharmaceutical Market (IPM) for December,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments. Bajaj Broking meanwhile attributed the sharp rise in the share prices to selective buying. HDFC Securities began coverage on Indian contract drug makers Divi’s Labs, Anthem Biosciences, Sai Life Sciences, Laurus Labs and Piramal Pharma. The brokerage sees rising research & development outsourcing boosting Indian contract drug makers that have expanded capabilities to cover various stages of drug development. India's share in global contract research, development, and manufacturing organisations (CRDMO) market will likely rise to 4.7 percent by 2029 from 3.8 percent in 2024, ""making it an attractive sector"", it added. HDFC Securities further said that low labour costs will act as an advantage as companies reduce China dependence. It expects revenue CAGR to accelerate to 15 percent in FY25-28 as against 9 percent in FY23-25, with EBITDA CAGR at 22 percent as against 12 percent. Divi's Laboratories shares jumped over 4.5 percent to close at Rs 6,651 apiece. Citi has called the stock its “top pick” in India’s pharma sector, stating that 2026 can be an inflection year for the company. It added that Divi’s has strong pipeline catalysts over the next 12 months and the generic segment is expected to witness a recovery. Citi expects the company’s revenue to expand by three times, and EBITDA to rise by four times over FY25-FY30.

"Kaynes Tech, Dixon fall up to 5.5% even as Jefferies expects strong growth from EMS firms through FY28",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/kaynes-tech-dixon-fall-up-to-5-5-even-as-jefferies-expects-strong-growth-from-ems-firms-through-fy28-13759749.html,"Shares of electronics manufacturing services (EMS) companies Kaynes Technology India and Dixon Technologies (India) fell by up to 5.5 percent on Tuesday amid profit booking, even as brokerage firm Jefferies maintained a positive outlook on the sector through FY28. Shares of Kaynes Technology declined 5.37 percent to close at Rs 3,783 apiece on the National Stock Exchange (NSE), while Dixon Technologies settled 3.11 percent lower at Rs 11,676. Amber Enterprises India ended flat at Rs 6,710 pershare, while Syrma SGS Technology closed marginally higher at Rs 752.10, up 0.25 percent. The decline in select stocks came despite Jefferies projecting strong growth for Indian EMS companies over the medium term. In a note, Jefferies said Indian electronics manufacturers are expected to deliver a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 44 percent in earnings per share between FY25 and FY28, driven by execution. The brokerage said the government's production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for components has supported growth in the segment and added that it prefers Indian component manufacturers over original equipment manufacturers in 2026.

"ITC falls 2%, extends 2026 losses to 15%: Has the 'dividend' stock bottomed out? Here's what analysts say",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/itc-falls-2-extend-2026-losses-to-15-has-the-dividend-stock-bottomed-out-here-s-what-analysts-say-13759627.html,"The shares of ITC dropped more than 2 percent on January 6, extending losses to 15 percent in four sessions after government imposed new excise duty on cigarettes. Analysts noted that the bearish momentum continues to prevail, while listing out key levels to watch out for possible recovery. The shares of the hotels-to-cigarettes conglomerate dropped to a fresh 52-week low of Rs 337.75 apiece. This takes the total market cap erosion to Rs 82,000 crore in just four days. The stock later recovered some losses to close at Rs 343.25 apiece. ITC is widely-regarded as a safe stock to hold considering its dividend-paying history. In FY25, ITC declared and paid a total dividend of Rs 14.35 per share. As of January 6, 2026, the company's dividend yield is approximately 4.10 percent. Why are ITC shares falling? The Parliament in December approved the Central Excise (Amendment) Bill, 2025, clearing the way for a sharp increase in duties on cigarettes and other tobacco products. It replaces a temporary levy on cigarettes and tobacco products. The excise duty would be imposed on cigarettes in addition to a 40 percent GST, according to an order issued late on Wednesday. The finance ministry notified that an excise duty of Rs 2,050–8,500 per 1,000 sticks, depending on cigarette length, will take effect from February 1. The duty translates into a 22-28 percent increase in overall costs for 75-85 mm cigarettes, analysts at ICICI Securities said. ""Cigarettes longer than 75 mm account for roughly 16% of ITC's volumes and are likely to see price increases of 2–3 rupees per stick as a result of the levy,"" they said. ITC technical view: The stock is continuing to trade under pressure as it is kept below the crucial moving averages, with bearish momentum prevailing, said Siddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director, Vibhavangal Anukulakara. The analyst added that the initial level of support is seen around Rs 328, while the resistance can be noted at Rs 388-390. ""A close above the resistance mark might trigger the recovery phase; however, a close below Rs 328 might result in intensification of the negative trend,” he further said. ITC's collapse following the 40 percent cigarette tax hike has triggered one of the most violent single-day liquidations in recent memory, with volumes surging to 30 times the daily average - a classic capitulation signature that often marks exhaustion bottoms rather than the beginning of sustained declines, said Darshan Rathod, Director and COO of Multyfi. 'Technical damage is severe yet...' ""The technical damage is severe yet paradoxically constructive for contrarians. The breach of ₹375-380 multi-year support and subsequent plunge to ₹342 has pushed the stock 15% below its 200-day SMA. On the monthly timeframe, this represents the deepest oversold condition since the COVID crash, with the stock now trading at a 15% monthly decline… The derivatives landscape tells a nuanced story. While Call writing at ₹350 reflects near-term bearishness, the Put/Call ratio of 0.61 and total Put OI of 7.71 crore versus Call OI of 12.54 crore suggests the street may be overly positioned for downside. The heavy Put accumulation at ₹340-330 strikes indicates smart money establishing safety nets,” he added. Rathod explained that in the near-term, Rs 340 becomes a key level to watch out for. Reclaiming Rs 360 with normalizing volumes would confirm stabilization, while sustained trade below Rs 335 risks extension toward Rs 310-300, though genuine trend reversal requires reconquest of Rs 400, he said. 'Downside momentum to continue, avoid fresh entries': Drumil Vithlani, Technical Research Analyst at Bonanza, said that the stock is clearly showing strong bearish sentiment. “The stock is now in a downtrend and is trading below all major EMAs of 20, 50, 100, and 200, confirming weakness on the weekly timeframe. The RSI stands at 22.96, indicating an oversold zone; however, its 14-day RSI average is near 42.8, suggesting that any short-term cool-off in RSI may not translate into a sustainable reversal,” he said. The analyst expects the downside momentum to continue, and advised investors to avoid fresh entries. “The earlier support at 380 now acts as a strong resistance zone, while the next major support is placed near the 310 level,” he said. Macquarie has downgraded the stock to 'Neutral' from 'Buy', and slashed its target price by 34 percent to Rs 330 apiece, NDTV Profit reported. The latest target price implies a downside potential of around 6 percent from the stock's previous closing price. ITC’s trend has weakened meaningfully following a sharp breakdown from the crucial support zone around the Rs 400 level, said Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking. The stock has decisively slipped below the 100-week moving average, with a strong bearish candle accompanied by a spike in volumes, indicating distribution rather than routine profit booking, he added. ""Momentum indicators have deteriorated, as the RSI has drifted towards the 50 zone and the stochastic oscillator has entered a bearish crossover, pointing to further downside risk. Immediate support is placed in the ₹330–340 zone, which remains a critical medium-term support area. A sustained break below this band could open the door for a deeper corrective move towards the ₹300 mark. On the upside, any recovery attempt is likely to face initial resistance near ₹360, followed by a major hurdle around ₹390. Participants are advised to avoid aggressive positioning at current levels and wait for clear signs of consolidation or stabilization,"" he further said."

Technically, after an early morning intraday rally, the market registered profit booking again at higher levels. We are of the view that the intraday market formation is still on the weaker side, but a fresh selloff is possible only after the breach of 26,100/84800. Below this level, the market could slip to 26,000-25,950/84500-84350. On the flip side, 26,250/85300 would be the immediate resistance zone for the bulls. Above this, the market could bounce back up to 26,350-26,380/85500-85700. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The Nifty has slipped as weakness continues to prevail after the formation of a new lifetime high yesterday. On the lower end, it found intraday support around 26100. The trend looks likely to remain range-bound in the near term. Going forward, a sustained rally may emerge upon a maneuvering effort by bulls to take the Nifty above 26300. On the downside, support is placed at 26000.

"Trent shares fall 9%: Keep Rs 3,700 as stop loss to go long in Zudio-parent's stock, says analyst",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trent-shares-fall-9-keep-rs-3-700-as-stop-loss-to-go-long-in-zudio-parent-s-stock-says-analyst-13759367.html,"The shares of Zudio and Westside-parent Trent tumbled more than 9 percent on January 6 after the company released provisional results for Q3 FY26. Analysts expect sustained weakness, advising what strategy investors should take. The shares of the company dropped to Rs 4,017.2 apiece in the afternoon of Tuesday, snapping a four-session gaining streak and emerging as the top losers on Indian benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty. Trent Q3 business update: Trent released its business update for the October-December quarter of FY26 in the post market hours of January 5. The company reported standalone revenue from sale of products at Rs 5,220 crore during the quarter. This marks a 17 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise from the Rs 4,466 crore reported in the same period of the previous financial year. Notably, the Zudio and Westside-parent’s revenue from operations had risen more than 17 percent YoY to Rs 4,724 crore during Q2 FY26, same as the revenue growth reported in Q3. The company’s revenue from sale of products in the 9 months ended on December 31 (April-December) meanwhile rose 18 percent YoY to Rs 14,604 crore, up from Rs 12,368 crore in the year-ago period. At the end of Q3 FY26, Trent had 278 Westside stores, 854 Zudio (including 4 in UAE) and 32 stores across other lifestyle concepts. During the quarter, the company opened 17 new Westside stores, and 48 new Zudio stores. What led to Trent's share price crash? Today’s sharp fall extends a broader trend that has already positioned Trent as the worst-performing stock within the Nifty 50 in 2025, underscoring that today’s fall is part of a deeper re-rating cycle rather than a one-day reaction, said Harshal Dasani, Business Head, INVasset PMS. “The key driver is a visible moderation in growth momentum flagged in recent business updates. Over the last few years, Trent was priced as a high-consistency compounder, supported by aggressive store expansion and strong same-store sales, particularly in the value fashion segment. As demand indicators soften and incremental growth becomes less linear, the market is recalibrating forward earnings assumptions,” Dasani added. What amplifies the downside is valuation sensitivity, the analyst said. At peak levels, the stock reflected near-flawless execution and sustained high growth. Any signal of demand normalization or margin pressure forces a disproportionate correction, especially in stocks with heavy institutional ownership and crowded positioning, he added. “The current price action suggests that the market is transitioning from growth extrapolation to growth verification. Until there is clearer visibility on demand recovery and earnings trajectory, volatility is likely to remain elevated, with multiples adjusting to a more normalized growth outlook rather than past optimism,” Dasani concluded. Siddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director, Vibhavangal Anukulakara, said that the initial drop in stock value with high market volume suggests that market players are factoring in a slowing down of momentum and being cautious on consumer demand. The stock, on one hand, continues to exhibit some inherent strength with further expansion of stores and high buy-side interest profile among analysts. In the short term, market performance would largely be driven by market re-rating of earnings predictions, he added. Trent technical view: Technically, the stock remains in a broader downtrend, trading well below its 50, 100, and 200-day EMAs, confirming sustained weakness, said Drumil Vithlani, Technical Research Analyst at Bonanza. “The recent bounce was corrective in nature and got sold into, highlighting strong supply near the ₹4,400–4,500 zone. RSI has slipped back toward the 40 region, reflecting fading momentum and lack of bullish strength. Unless the stock reclaims ₹4,500 with volume, the bias stays bearish to rangebound, with downside risk toward ₹3,800–3,700. A wait-and-watch or sell-on-rise approach is advisable in the near term,” he said. Motilal Oswal on Trent: Motilal Oswal Financial Services noted that the revenue growth reported by Trent is lower than the 20 percent revenue growth estimated by the brokerage. It however noted that the revenue growth remained steady at 17 percent YoY after several quarters of revenue growth deceleration. Revenue growth is primarily driven by an approximately 28 percent YoY increase in store count, with revenue per store declining around 11 percent YoY, indicating continued cannibalization in store-level sale, it added. “Trent’s stock price had run up in the last few days (up ~9% since 19th Dec’25) on expectations of a pick-up in revenue growth. A weaker-than-expected number could weigh on the recent stock price recovery as earnings downgrades are likely to continue in the near term,” Motilal said, while keeping a ‘Buy’ call on the stock. Antique Stock Broking on Trent: Antique Stock Broking flagged moderating growth on high base and unfavourable demand. It cut its target price for the stock to Rs 5,700 apiece from Rs 6,650 apiece, while maintaining its 'Buy rating on optimism that the company can steer high competition on a medium-to-long term basis. The latest target price implies an upside potential of more than 50 percent from the stock's previous closing price. Morgan Stanley however remained 'Overweight' on the stock, saying that the growth is more or less in line with its estimated 18 percent YoY rise Trent's revenue growth has beaten Citi's 15.3 percent rise expectations. Higher store additions drive revenue, the brokerage said, adding that it remains cautious due to competition and weak revenue per sq ft trend. It has maintained its 'Sell' rating with a target price of Rs 4,350 apiece. HDFC Securities on Trent: HDFC Securities upgraded Trent shares to 'Add', with a target price of Rs 4,700 apiece. This implies an upside potential of more than 6 percent from the stock's previous closing price. ""Trent remains a top-class franchise. A combination of healthy inputs for future operational KPIs (SSSG and store expansion) and a c.50% valuation cut (117x FY28 P/E to 60x FY28 P/E) underpins our decision to upgrade Trent to an ADD rating with an SOTP-based TP of 4,700/share,"" it said. Trent share price history: Trent shares have fallen around 27 percent in the past six months, and over 42 percent in the past one year. This came after the stock rallied over 480 percent in the past five years. The stock currently has a P/E ratio of more than 103. Follow all LIVE updates from the stock markets here."

The rally followed Emkay Research upgrading Bajaj Auto to ‘Buy’ from ‘Add’ and increasing its price target to Rs 11,100, implying an upside of around 17 percent from current levels. According to the brokerage, the outlook is supported by strong export momentum and the launch of a refreshed Pulsar range in calendar year 2026, which is expected to drive earnings growth. Exports remain robust across Latin America and Asia, aided by currency depreciation, with exports forming about 44 percent of volumes in FY26 year-to-date compared with 39 percent in FY25 year-to-date, Emkay said. On the domestic front, the brokerage noted a recovery trend with a mild uptick in demand led by premium motorcycles and electric scooters during the third quarter of FY26. In the fast-growing electric three-wheeler segment, Bajaj Auto has overtaken Mahindra & Mahindra as of December 2025, with a market share of about 32 percent, the report said. Emkay added that strong exports, particularly to Latin America, Asia and parts of Africa, along with currency tailwinds, are likely to support margins, given the company’s export-heavy sales mix. The brokerage said Bajaj Auto offers the best risk-reward at current levels, supported by export trends and new product launches, and expects volume, revenue and earnings growth over the medium term.

"Change yourself, change your result, says market trader Shubham Agarwal",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/change-yourself-change-your-result-says-market-trader-shubham-agarwal-13754261.html,"New year brings hope, energy, and the feeling that something good is about to happen. This hope is what keeps us going through difficult phases of life. In trading, it's no different. Some traders are just starting out, full of optimism. Others are facing difficult initial months, getting hit by the market more often than not, yet hope keeps them going, hope that everything will change in the near term. Then there's a third kind of trader. Someone who has been in the market for years, taking losses month after month, yet still hopeful. Hopeful that one day they'll discover that one strategy, one indicator, one algo, one mentor that will change everything. These traders have given the market their time, energy, emotions, and soul. After every painful session, they go to bed hoping tomorrow will be different. Traders change strategies, asset classes, and study methods over the years. They go through courses, seminars, even consult astrologers to change their fate. However, all this effort doesn't change the results. Why? Because traders forget to change the most important thing: themselves. It's easier said than done. To change years of habits and subconscious patterns, you need to step aside and get away from the market. Stopping is never easy. But if you want different results, you must do it. First, pull up your last year's performance. You need to realize how deep the situation is. Then find out how you lose money. What are your patterns? Revenge trading after losses? Overtrading on winning days? Holding losers too long? While going through your trades, you'll figure this out. Develop rules to avoid these patterns. Remember, in trading you focus on reducing losses, not maximizing profits. During this process, start exercising. Physical movement rewires the brain. New neural pathways form. Old trading patterns break. Then come to that one study you know best. Price and OI relationship, PCR, IV, Option OI, anything you're comfortable with. Do proper backtesting for at least six months of historical data. Use hedged strategies: debit strategies, credit strategies, option writing, whatever you know best. Why hedged? It helps control losses. Once you know your maximum loss, you feel relaxed and can take right decisions. After backtesting, understand your win percentage. You need at least 65% win ratio with 1:2 risk reward. Then do front testing for at least a month. Now you're ready for real trading. Remember, do not predict the market, only ride it by analyzing derivatives data. This year through these articles, we'll learn different derivatives data and strategies that may be useful in your trading journey. If you're still not motivated, then for 10 minutes just remember all the psychological hardships you went through over the years. Decide for yourself that you will not let yourself feel that way again. Then build a daily routine to incorporate these processes. Even if that means only two hours a day. So gear up and let this year become the year of a new beginning.

Groww shares rise marginally as Motilal Oswal sees up to 19% upside,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/groww-shares-rise-marginally-as-motilal-oswal-sees-up-to-19-upside-13759141.html,"Groww shares rose marginally on Monday after Motilal Oswal initiated coverage on Billionbrains Garage Ventures Ltd., the parent company of the discount broking platform. The stock touched an intraday high of Rs 159.70 on the NSE, up 2.7 percent. It later pared some gains to trade at Rs 155.89 around 2 pm, up 0.23 percent. Motilal Oswal initiated coverage with a ‘buy’ rating and a price target of Rs 185 per share, implying a potential upside of 19 percent from Monday’s closing levels. In its note, the brokerage said Groww has scaled rapidly to become the country’s largest retail broking platform on an active client basis within four years of launch. It added that the company had a market share of 26.8 percent in November, about 9 percentage points higher than the second-largest player. The brokerage said the company is building additional growth levers to diversify revenues and improve earnings quality. It said the expansion of the margin trading facility business, the growth of its commodities franchise, the increase in the loan against shares portfolio and the entry into wealth management could reduce dependence on the broking segment. Motilal Oswal said it expects Groww’s broking revenue contribution to decline to 67 per cent in FY28 from 85 per cent in FY25, leading to a more resilient earnings profile.

Tata Motors PV shares fall 4% after JLR wholesales drop 43% in Q3 after cyberattack,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/tata-motors-pv-shares-drop-4-after-jlr-wholesales-drop-43-in-q3-after-cyberattack-13759075.html,"The shares of Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles dropped more than 4 percent on January 6 after the company released Jaguar Land Rover's wholesale and retail sales numbers for the third quarter of the ongoing FY26. The shares of the automaker dropped to Rs 360 apiece, snapping a five-session gaining streak. JLR Q3 update: Tata Motors PV said that Jaguar Land Rover's (JLR) wholesales fell 43.3 percent year-on-year to 59,200 units in Q3 FY26. Sequentially, the wholesales fell 10.6 percent from Q2 FY26.

The company said that production returned to normal levels only by mid -November after the massive cyberattack. Due to this and also the time required to distribute vehicles globally once produced, wholesale and retail volumes reduced on a sequential and annual basis, the company said. ""In addition, the planned wind down of legacy Jaguar models ahead of the launch of new Jaguar, and incremental US tariffs impacting JLR’s US exports, continued to impact volumes,"" Tata Motors further said. It is worthy to note that these are provisional numbers. The audited numbers will be released when the company reports its full financial results for Q3 FY 26 in February 2026.

"Nifty target 2026: India market outlook cut to neutral, Bernstein sees modest gains; check bullish sector call",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/nifty-target-2026-india-market-outlook-cut-to-neutral-bernstein-sees-modest-gains-check-bullish-sector-call-alpha-article-13758728.html,"Adopting a non-consensus view, global brokerage firm Bernstein has downgraded its outlook on the Indian market to ‘neutral’ for 2026, projecting a modest 8% upside for the Nifty. Venugopal Garre, Managing Director and India Head of Research at Bernstein, explained in an interview with CNBC TV18 that while the call was not intentionally contrarian, a confluence of factors limits the potential for outsized returns. Garre detailed the rationale behind the downgrade, pointing to a peaking macroeconomic environment. He anticipates India's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth will moderate from around 8% to a 6.5% trajectory over the next few quarters. “We're not really seeing any major macro collapse,” he clarified, but noted the peak has passed. Furthermore, he believes the expected recovery in earnings growth is already factored into current market valuations, and that policy variables to stimulate the economy are largely exhausted. “A lot of shift of the burden of economic growth has to shift to private sector, which may not yet be ready to handle that,” Garre added, also citing constraints on the government's balance sheet. Bernstein's Nifty target of 28,100, implying an 8% return, is derived from a 13.5% earnings CAGR forecast over two years and a 19x two-year forward multiple, which Garre described as “not conservative at all.” The challenge, he stated, was finding significant upside from the current juncture. Despite the neutral overall stance, Bernstein has upgraded the real estate sector, which was one of the worst performers in 2025. Garre views this as a 'catch-up' opportunity, noting that property cycles typically last six to seven years and the market is currently in a period of digestion. With stock prices having seen a major correction and the sector's sensitivity to interest rates, an expected 50 basis point rate cut this year could provide a lift. However, he cautioned that returns would just be better than the Nifty's 8%, not in the 30-40% range. Conversely, the firm has downgraded consumer staples. Garre expressed concern over rising competitive intensity from well-funded quick-commerce players, which could erode the dominance of incumbent brands. He also cited muted volume growth prospects and uncertainty surrounding rural demand and the monsoon as reasons for the cut, especially with valuations not being cheap. On the much-anticipated India-US trade deal, Garre has factored it into his analysis but believes its market impact will be a short-lived narrative lasting only a few days. He argued that for such treaties to be sustainable, a country must be unambiguously aligned with the US camp, a comfort he does not currently have. “This is going to be just a point trade treaty than anything else,” he remarked, suggesting a small market up-move and slight rupee appreciation as the primary outcomes. He is using an overweight position in IT services to hedge this event. Regarding the hype around Artificial Intelligence (AI), Garre was skeptical about its immediate impact on the Indian corporate landscape, calling it a “three to four-year story” for meaningful adoption. “Real world implementations are extremely meager… this is not a 12-month story or a 24-month story,” he stated, adding that the technology itself needs to stabilize before widespread corporate adoption. Looking at monetary policy, Garre expects the Reserve Bank of India to deliver 50 to 75 basis points in rate cuts this year, seeing limited scope for more aggressive action due to currency management considerations. Concluding on a positive note, Garre highlighted that the economy is stable and not collapsing. He pointed to several sectors where Bernstein remains overweight, including financials, telecom, consumer tech, and mild overweights on IT and real estate. He also noted that a busy year for IPOs and fundraising will present investors with many new opportunities."

BJAUT’s overall domestic 2W market share has bottomed out, with slight pick-up, driven by market share of both premium motorcycles and e-scooters in Q3FY26TD. Export momentum remains strong, led by LatAm/Asia, which coupled with currency depreciation-led tailwinds should aid the overall margin trajectory given its strong exports volume mix (~44% mix as of FY26YTD vs 39% in FY25YTD). BJAUT’s e-3W portfolio has also scaled up meaningfully, and overtaken M&M to become the #1 in E-3Ws (~31.8% market share in Dec-25 vs 31.9% in FY25) while sustaining its #2 spot in E-2Ws for the last 4M, with EBITDA breakeven already achieved. Also, a gradual turnaround in KTM provides incremental upside potential. Outlook We upgrade BJAUT to BUY from Add and roll forward our TP to Dec-27E, hoisting it ~17% to Rs11,100 (from Rs9,500). This implies an upside of ~17% (+2.7% dividend yield in Dec-27E) on account of FY27E/28E EPS upgrade by ~4/9% and incorporating Bajaj Auto Credit at Rs300/sh, basis 2x FY28E P/B, given the meaningful ramp-up in operations (H1FY26 PAT at Rs2.3bn vs Rs0.6bn in FY25).

The index had ended 0.18 percent lower on Monday but recouped most of those losses in Tuesday’s session. Excluding Monday, the index has risen in five of the last six trading sessions. ICICI Bank led the gains, rising up to 3 percent during the day. Union Bank of India and IndusInd Bank followed, gaining 2.55 percent and 1.9 percent, respectively. State Bank of India, Axis Bank, Canara Bank and Yes Bank were up by as much as 1.5 percent. In contrast, index heavyweight HDFC Bank remained among the top laggards on the Nifty Bank index after its provisional business update for the third quarter. The stock slipped to Rs 956, its lowest level in over three months, after falling more than 4 percent over the last two sessions. India’s largest private sector lender reported 11.9 percent year-on-year growth in loans and 11.5 percent growth in deposits for the quarter ended December. Analysts at Nomura said slower deposit growth constrained loan expansion during the quarter, with the credit-deposit ratio nearing 100 percent. HDFC Bank was also the biggest loser on the Nifty Private Bank index, even as the index itself rose up to 0.5 percent in intraday trade. Sensex down 300 pts, Nifty below 26,200: Geopolitical tensions, 4 other key factors behind market decline Axis Bank gained the most since July 19, 2024, after reporting growth in advances and deposits. The bank posted a 14.1 percent year-on-year increase in gross advances and a 15 percent rise in total deposits in the December quarter. Citi said the corporate segment appeared to have gained traction, while the retail segment showed signs of recovery driven by pent-up demand, though it added that the momentum in the third quarter was not expected to be as strong as in the first quarter. Macquarie Research said Axis Bank’s deposit growth outpaced loan growth, in contrast to broader system trends. IndusInd Bank, meanwhile, reported a sequential decline in loans for the fourth straight quarter, indicating continued weakness in its growth outlook. Jefferies said the bank is likely to consolidate in FY26 and expects improvement in FY27 as a new management team takes charge under a new chief executive, adding that valuations appear attractive for a turnaround. Nomura said IndusInd Bank is undergoing a significant overhaul in processes, senior management and strategy, and that clarity on margins and credit costs is awaited in the bank’s third-quarter results.

It held a market share of 26.8% in Nov’25, about 9% higher than the second-largest player. Originally a niche mutual fund platform, it now commands a meaningful market share in stocks (~25.8%) and derivatives (~17.3%). From a zero-revenue MF distributor, GROWW has evolved into a full-stack investment platform spanning broking, commodities, MTF, credit, and wealth management, with 14.8m active users across products by the end of 1HFY26. The company’s strong product adoption over the years has led to a ~3x surge in its revenue from FY23 to FY25; we further expect its revenue to double over FY25-28. GROWW is increasingly building optional growth levers to diversify revenues and improve earnings quality. The rapid expansion of MTF, a fast-growing commodities franchise, along with the growth of the credit portfolio through LAS and the entry into wealth management, collectively reduce dependence on the volatile broking segment. This aids a structurally more resilient earnings profile. We expect GROWW’s broking revenue contribution to dip to 67% in FY28 from 85% in FY25.

HPCL eyes $2.5+ GRM boost from Vizag upgrade project; Barmer refinery commissioning in weeks: CMD Kaushal,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/hpcl-eyes-2-5-grm-boost-from-vizag-upgrade-project-barmer-refinery-commissioning-in-weeks-cmd-kaushal-alpha-article-13756528.html,"Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) is poised for a significant uplift in its refining margins and earnings trajectory, driven by two technologically advanced projects, according to its Chairman and Managing Director, Vikas Kaushal. Speaking with CNBC TV18, Kaushal detailed the commissioning of a futuristic Residue Upgradation Facility (RUF) at its Vizag refinery and the imminent start-up of the new Barmer refinery in Rajasthan. The Vizag RUF project, which commenced operations over the weekend, is set to be a game-changer for the company's profitability. Kaushal explained that the facility employs a state-of-the-art technology, LC MAX, deployed for the first time globally. This allows the refinery to convert low-value bottom residues from the distillation process into high-value light distillates, primarily diesel. ""What that means is something which is a negative crack is going to go up into a positive crack,"" he stated. The distillate yield from the refinery is expected to jump from 74% to nearly 86%. Financially, this upgradation is projected to add 'roughly $2.5-plus per barrel' to the Gross Refining Margin (GRM) of the Vizag refinery. This enhancement provides HPCL with the flexibility to process 'dirtier,' cheaper crudes while still producing high-quality fuels, thereby boosting margins. While declining to provide specific profit after tax (PAT) figures due to the upcoming earnings announcement, Kaushal confirmed the GRM projection is on track once the unit fully stabilises. Addressing the company's crude sourcing strategy, Kaushal noted that while HPCL has not recently procured much Russian crude, non-sanctioned cargoes remain an option if they are economically viable and fit the refinery's crude basket. He clarified that all spot purchases are based on economic decisions, supplementing the 30-50% of crude sourced via long-term contracts. Sourcing from Venezuela is currently not happening due to international sanctions. The next major milestone for HPCL is the commissioning of the Barmer refinery in Rajasthan, a joint venture where HPCL holds a 74% stake. Kaushal announced that the commissioning process for the refinery section is anticipated to begin ""in the next few weeks."" The integrated petrochemical section will follow later in the year. He described Barmer as the ""most complex greenfield refinery ever done in India,"" highlighting its integrated design. However, he remained cautious about providing immediate earnings guidance, noting that a greenfield project requires a ramp-up period to achieve stable operations. With the addition of Barmer's 9 million tonnes of capacity, the total refining capability available to HPCL, including its joint ventures, will approach 40 million tonnes. This expansion underpins the company's long-term growth ambitions. Kaushal reiterated the company's five-year plan to double its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) from approximately ₹20,000 crore to ₹40,000 crore, stating, ""We are in that trajectory."" On the financial front, Kaushal emphasised a focus on deleveraging now that the heavy capital expenditure cycle is concluding. The company has already reduced its debt-to-equity ratio from 1.35 to 1.07 over the past year. ""Deleveraging is something we are working on and creating more room for the future growth,"" he said. Regarding shareholder returns, he hinted that the trend of dividend payouts would likely continue, though formal decisions rest with the board. When asked about the potential for bringing a new partner into the Barmer project, Kaushal stated that the immediate focus for both HPCL and its partner, the Government of Rajasthan, is solely on completing the project and establishing it as a landmark asset for the Indian refining sector."
"Hindustan Zinc shares rise 2% as silver prices jump, silver ETFs climb 3%",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/hindustan-zinc-shares-rise-2-as-silver-prices-jump-silver-etfs-climb-3-13758649.html,"The shares of Hindustan Zinc rose more than 2 percent on January 6 as silver prices jumped amid geopolitical uncertainties. Silver ETFs also surged, mirroring the sharp rise in the precious and industrial metal. Hindustan Zinc shares rose to Rs 643.65 apiece in the early trading hours of Tuesday. The company is the largest producer of silver in India, and produces refined silver with a minimum 99.9 percent purity. The sharp rise in the bullion's prices is expected to further boost the stock. Silver prices: Silver prices surged above the $79/oz mark, and is now just 6 percent away from new record high territory. This marks a 9 percent rise since the US captured Venezuela's President Maduro. Silver futures with March expiry on the Multi Commodity Exchange of India (MCX) rose nearly 2 percent to Rs 2,50,723 per kilogram, while futures with May expiry also rose 2 percent to Rs 2,56,800 per kilogram, nearing lifetime highs. The future contracts with July and September expiries meanwhile jumped over 2 percent to hit fresh all-time highs of Rs 2,63,300 per kilogram and Rs 2,70,036 per kilogram, respectively. Silver ETFs: Silver exchange traded funds (ETFs) mirrored the sharp rise in silver prices. Mirae Asset Silver ETF, Aditya Birla Sun Life Silver ETF and DSP Silver ETF rose nearly 3 percent each, while Nippon India Silver ETF, Kotak Silver ETF, UTI Silver ETF, HDFC Silver ETF, ICICI Prudential Silver ETF, Zerodha Silver ETF, SBI Silver ETF, Axis Silver ETF, Motilal Oswal Silver ETF, Tata Silver ETF, Groww Silver ETF and others meanwhile grew more than 2 percent each. What should investors do? Silver shows higher volatility than gold showing a bubble-like behavior, Aggarwal from VSRK Capital said. ""Strategy entry can be planned when prices stabilise near support zones with market sentiment improving but consider that metals tend to remain choppy for years after a strong rally,"" he added. Looking ahead to 2026, the medium-term outlook remains constructive, especially for silver, Harshal Dasani, Business Head, INVasset PMS said, adding that the structural industrial demand linked to electronics, solar and electrification remains strong, while supply constraints have persisted for several years, keeping the market in deficit. ""Silver, in particular, had become a momentum trade in 2025, rising sharply over the year, which made it vulnerable to profit-booking and leveraged unwinds once sentiment turned. Gold, too, delivered outsized gains over the past year, so even routine corrections appear severe when they follow such a strong run,"" Dasani said. In the near term, price direction will continue to be influenced by the US dollar and real interest rates—any repricing toward higher yields tends to pressure non-yielding assets like gold and silver, while softer yields and risk aversion restore their appeal, according to the analyst.

"HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank among stocks to add ahead of Q3 earnings, Swiggy looks cheap: Market expert Matt Orton",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/hdfc-bank-icici-bank-among-stocks-to-add-ahead-of-q3-earnings-swiggy-looks-cheap-market-expert-matt-orton-alpha-article-13758295.html,"The outlook for global markets in 2026 appears optimistic, but it will be a year of differentiation, particularly for artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, which will need to prove their earnings power. In this environment, investors would be well-served by leaning into cyclical sectors and capitalizing on the strength in base metals, according to strategist Matt Orton. Speaking with CNBC TV18, Matt Orton, the Chief Market Strategist at Raymond James Investment, expressed optimism for continued growth across global markets. However, he cautioned that 2026 will be a ""show me year"" for AI. ""It's going to be very important, especially as we head into earning season given how much so many of these AI companies have moved, that the higher quality names… are going to be the winners,"" Orton stated. He said companies that are unable to sustain earnings per share (EPS) growth could face challenges. Given this backdrop, Orton advocates for a cyclical tilt. ""Leaning into cyclicals is a winning play for 2026,"" he said. For the US, this involves a focus on financials and industrials, including those tied to data centre build-outs and manufacturing. This strategy extends to emerging markets and Europe, where he sees opportunities in financials. In India, Orton highlighted HDFC Bank as his top overweight position, with ICICI Bank also showing positive signs. He advised adding to these names heading into what he expects will be a good earnings season. Orton also shared his views on Indian IT services, a sector that has significantly underperformed. While he said he is not ready to go ‘all in,’ he is considering ‘dipping his toe’ into the space as sentiment begins to shift after sharp underperformance. ""You're starting to see a change of heart,"" he noted, pointing to new plans at Tech Mahindra and the positive global exposure of Infosys. However, he reiterated that it remains a ""show me market"" where companies must prove themselves. On the consumer front, Orton remains invested in companies like Swiggy, which he owns. Despite intense competition, he is positive on Swiggy's efforts to shore up its credit lines and invest in higher-value propositions. ""I like being exposed to the Indian consumer and I think Swiggy looks fairly cheap,"" Orton commented. He added that he expects conditions to improve into the first half of 2026 after a difficult 2026. Finally, the strategist sees the recent rallies in base metals like copper, aluminum, and platinum as a bullish signal for the global economy. ""The moves in base metals are certainly a signal back to that cyclical element… it highlights that global growth remains resilient,"" he explained. He is particularly enthusiastic about copper, citing a supply-demand imbalance driven by its use in data centres, chips, and electric vehicles, alongside significant underinvestment from miners. Orton concluded by advising investors to be prepared for volatility but to use market dips as buying opportunities, as he believes the fundamental backdrop supports continued upside."
"IT sector outlook turns positive on AI services recovery; Motilal Oswal shares top largecap, midcap stocks",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/it-sector-outlook-turns-positive-on-ai-services-recovery-motilal-oswal-shares-top-largecap-midcap-stocks-alpha-article-13756892.html,"The Indian information technology (IT) sector has likely bottomed out, though the upcoming third-quarter earnings are expected to be a non-event due to seasonal weakness, according to Abhishek Pathak, research analyst at Motilal Oswal Financial Services. Speaking with CNBC TV18, Pathak shared a positive outlook for the sector over a 2-3 year horizon, driven by the anticipated growth in artificial intelligence (AI) services. While acknowledging that the third quarter is seasonally weak for the industry due to furloughs, Pathak stated, ""We are actually in the camp that IT has actually bottomed out."" He expressed confidence that by 2026, as enterprise focus shifts from AI capital expenditure to AI services, the benefits will trickle down to Indian IT services companies. The key trigger for this recovery will be the transition of short-cycle AI deals from pilot stages to full-scale implementation, a trend he expects to gain momentum from mid-calendar year 2026. He advised investors to watch for partnership agreements between Indian IT firms and AI leaders like Anthropic as a leading indicator of this shift. On the debate between large-caps and mid-caps, Pathak noted that while mid-caps have historically held the upper hand over the last five years, select large-caps now offer significant value at their current trading prices. ""We do believe that large caps selectively offer great value at these prices as well,"" he said, indicating a balanced approach. Commenting on Coforge's recent $2.5 billion acquisition, Pathak expressed a positive view on the deal's strategic value, highlighting the new capabilities and verticals it opens up for the company. While he conceded the valuation is ""slightly expensive"" compared to Coforge's past acquisitions, he justified it by noting the target is an AI-native and digital engineering firm. The primary concern, he pointed out, is the potential for equity dilution over the next year as the deal is integrated. Regarding his top picks, Pathak recommended a mix of large and mid-tier companies. In the large-cap space, Motilal Oswal said it 'likes' Infosys and maintains HCL Tech as a top pick, calling it an ""all-weather stock"" for its well-balanced portfolio. Addressing concerns about HCL Tech's valuation premium, Pathak argued that in the current unique business cycle without a clear bellwether, any company that outperforms its peers has a right to be valued at a premium. In the mid-cap segment, Coforge is the top pick, valued for its sales engine and growth momentum. This is followed by Mphasis, which has strong deal wins, and Hexaware, which is considered primed for a turnaround."
Trent shares fall 8% after revenue growth stays flat sequentially; brokerage outlook mixed,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trent-shares-fall-8-after-q3-revenue-rises-17-to-rs-5-220-crore-miss-estimate-13758517.html,"The shares of Zudio and Westside-parent Trent tumbled 8 percent in the early trading hours of January 6 after the company released provisional results for the third quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026. The Tata Group company's shares fell to Rs 4,060 apiece on Tuesday, snapping a four-session gaining streak. The stock has emerged the top loser on the benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty. The sharp fall in the share price wiped off Rs 13,146 crore from Trent's market cap in just five minutes since opening on Tuesday. Trent Q3 business update: Trent released its business update for the October-December quarter of FY26 in the post market hours of January 5. The company reported standalone revenue from sale of products at Rs 5,220 crore during the quarter. This marks a 17 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise from the Rs 4,466 crore reported in the same period of the previous financial year. Notably, the Zudio and Westside-parent’s revenue from operations had risen more than 17 percent YoY to Rs 4,724 crore during Q2 FY26, same as the revenue growth reported in Q3. The company’s revenue from sale of products in the 9 months ended on December 31 (April-December) meanwhile rose 18 percent YoY to Rs 14,604 crore, up from Rs 12,368 crore in the year-ago period. At the end of Q3 FY26, Trent had 278 Westside stores, 854 Zudio (including 4 in UAE) and 32 stores across other lifestyle concepts. During the quarter, the company opened 17 new Westside stores, and 48 new Zudio stores. Motilal Oswal on Trent: Motilal Oswal Financial Services noted that the revenue growth reported by Trent is lower than the 20 percent revenue growth estimated by the brokerage. It however noted that the revenue growth remained steady at 17 percent YoY after several quarters of revenue growth deceleration. Revenue growth is primarily driven by an approximately 28 percent YoY increase in store count, with revenue per store declining around 11 percent YoY, indicating continued cannibalization in store-level sale, it added. “Trent’s stock price had run up in the last few days (up ~9% since 19th Dec’25) on expectations of a pick-up in revenue growth. A weaker-than-expected number could weigh on the recent stock price recovery as earnings downgrades are likely to continue in the near term,” Motilal said, while keeping a ‘Buy’ call on the stock. Antique Stock Broking on Trent: Antique Stock Broking flagged moderating growth on high base and unfavourable demand. It cut its target price for the stock to Rs 5,700 apiece from Rs 6,650 apiece, while maintaining its 'Buy rating on optimism that the company can steer high competition on a medium-to-long term basis. The latest target price implies an upside potential of more than 50 percent from the stock's previous closing price. Morgan Stanley however remained 'Overweight' on the stock, saying that the growth is more or less in line with its estimated 18 percent YoY rise Trent's revenue growth has beaten Citi's 15.3 percent rise expectations. Higher store additions drive revenue, the brokerage said, adding that it remains cautious due to competition and weak revenue per sq ft trend. It has maintained its 'Sell' rating with a target price of Rs 4,350 apiece. HDFC Securities on Trent: HDFC Securities upgraded Trent shares to 'Add', with a target price of Rs 4,700 apiece. This implies an upside potential of more than 6 percent from the stock's previous closing price. ""Trent remains a top-class franchise. A combination of healthy inputs for future operational KPIs (SSSG and store expansion) and a c.50% valuation cut (117x FY28 P/E to 60x FY28 P/E) underpins our decision to upgrade Trent to an ADD rating with an SOTP-based TP of 4,700/share,"" it said. Trent share price: Trent shares have fallen around 3 percent in the past five days, and more than 25 percent in the past six months. The stock declined more than 41 percent in the past one year, after rising 492 percent in the past five years. Follow all LIVE updates from the stock markets here."
