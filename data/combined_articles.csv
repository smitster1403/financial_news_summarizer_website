Tata Motors demerger creates two distinct bets: EVs and global luxury vs India’s infra backbone,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/tata-motors-demerger-creates-two-distinct-bets-evs-and-global-luxury-vs-india-s-infra-backbone-13593606.html,"Your next Land Rover car and the truck that carried it from the factory will no longer be made by the same company. Tata Motors’ demerger is more than a structural tidying-up. It is a redesign of financial logic. By splitting into two listed firms -- one for passenger vehicles (including Jaguar Land Rover and Tata’s EV portfolio) and the other for commercial vehicles -- the group aims to align each with its natural priorities: growth capital for the consumer-facing side, balance-sheet strength for the trucking arm. According to Chairman N Chandrasekaran, the goal is to give each business sharper focus and agility. For investors, this also means a cleaner choice. One company will offer exposure to global luxury cars and the EV transition, the other to India’s infrastructure build-out and domestic transport demand.Growth capital vs balance-sheet strengthManagement has acknowledged that the two businesses operate under very different imperatives. Passenger vehicles (PV, JLR and EVs): JLR has committed GBP 15 billion through FY30 for electrification. Tata Motors has earmarked up to Rs 35,000 crore over five years for EVs and new models in India. This is capital-intensive by design. Tata remains India’s EV market leader, even with its share slipping to ~55% in FY25 from over 70% earlier, as rivals entered the segment. EV volumes fell by about 11% YoY in FY25, enhancing the need for sustained investment to defend its position. Commercial vehicles (CV): The trucking arm is tied more directly to India’s economic cycle. In Q2 FY26, Tata sold 94,681 CV units, up 12% year-on-year, and retained nearly 49% market share in medium and heavy trucks. In FY25, CV division reported revenue of Rs 75,000 crore, with EBIT margin 9.1%. Capital expenditure here is modest, focused on fleet upgrades and compliance with emission norms. As of March 2024, Tata Motors’ net automotive debt was Rs 16,022 crore. For FY25, the management has indicated steady deleveraging. Post demerger, debt will be apportioned between the two companies, with the PV side expected to tolerate higher leverage in pursuit of growth and the CV side optimising for stronger credit metrics.Two investor propositionsThe demerger is intended to address what analysts call the “conglomerate discount” -- the market’s tendency to undervalue mixed businesses.The PV company is expected to be valued on growth multiples, given its investment commitments and exposure to luxury markets. In FY25, JLR reported revenues of GBP 29 billion with an EBIT margin of 8.5%, reflecting strong demand for Range Rover and Defender models. JLR has trimmed its FY26 EBIT margin guidance to 5-7%, citing headwinds from tariffs, elevated capital expenditures (including EV investment), and model transition pressures.” Tata’s domestic PV business generated ~Rs 48,500 crore revenue in FY25. While competition has intensified, this company will present itself as a growth story rooted in EVs and global luxury demand.The CV company will likely be judged as a play on India’s infrastructure cycle. The segment has of late benefited from freight demand and government capital expenditure. Margins remain sensitive to commodity costs and fleet utilisation, but the business offers a visible link to GDP and logistics spending. Investors seeking steadier domestic exposure may prefer this arm, which is expected to emphasise dividends and balance-sheet discipline.Some brokerage commentary suggests the two firms, once separately listed, could together trade at a premium of 10-15% over Tata Motors’ current market capitalisation, though estimates vary. Why together was a problem The mismatch between PV and CV cycles has long confounded valuation. When JLR stumbled during the pandemic and semiconductor shortages, Tata Motors’ consolidated stock sank despite CV profitability. Conversely, CV downturns weighed on the share price even as JLR recovered. Bundled together, the businesses obscured each other’s performance. By splitting, Tata allows each side to be judged on its own terms -- one by growth metrics, the other by cyclical industrial multiples. Lessons from global peers Tata is not alone. Daimler split Mercedes-Benz from Daimler Trucks in 2021, freeing each to pursue capital allocation independently. Mercedes accelerated EV launches, while Daimler Truck began trading on commercial-cycle fundamentals. Volvo’s earlier separation of Volvo Cars from its trucks and construction arm achieved a similar result, giving investors two distinct exposures. Tata is applying the same playbook to India’s largest automaker. Sharper identities, clearer choices The symbolism is still striking. Luxury SUVs and school buses may carry the same Tata badge, but they will no longer share the same balance sheet. Instead, two boards, two debt structures and two investor pitches will define their futures. As N Chandrasekaran said when the demerger was approved, “The three automotive business units are now operating independently and delivering consistent performance. This demerger will help them better capitalise on the opportunities provided by the market by enhancing their focus and agility.” For Tata Motors, the separation is about aligning capital with strategy: one arm deploying aggressively into global EVs and luxury cars, the other optimising for India’s freight and infrastructure growth. For investors, it means no longer buying both stories in a single share.Market snapshotStock price (Oct 1, 2025): Rs 718 on NSE, up 5.6% from previous closePerformance: up ~6.5% so far in FY26; down 32% in FY25; up 135% in FY24Market cap: Rs 2.64 trillionP/E ratio: 10.09Dividend yield: 0.84%Record date: October 14, 2025; one share of TMLCV will be allotted for every one Tata Motors share held, with listing of TMLCV planned on NSE and BSE"

After opening with a positive note, the Nifty continued with upside for better part of the session. Intraday dips in between have been bought into and the market closed with the decent gains. A long bull candle has been formed on the daily chart after the range bound action with weak bias of few sessions. This indicates a formation of short- term bottom reversal pattern in the market.

The short-term trend of Nifty has reversed up firmly on Wednesday with the formation of near-term bottom reversal pattern. The next upside hurdles to be watched around 25000 mark and next 25200 in the next one week. Immediate support is placed at 24600 levels. Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets rebounded sharply on Wednesday, snapping an eight-session losing streak on the back of firm domestic cues. The benchmark index opened higher, supported by buying across large-cap counters, and scaled an intraday high near 24,867.95 before trimming some gains to finally settle at 24,836.30. Sectoral performance was broad-based, with financials and other rate-sensitive sectors leading the advance, followed by pharma, realty, and IT. The broader markets also participated in the recovery, as both midcap and smallcap indices gained over a percent each, underscoring improved risk appetite among investors. The rebound was fueled by the Reserve Bank of India’s Monetary Policy Committee keeping the repo rate unchanged at 5.5%, in line with expectations, while signaling confidence in the domestic economic outlook. Additional support came from easing crude oil prices and sustained strength in global equities. Stability in the rupee against the US dollar and a decline in India VIX further reflected subsiding near-term volatility, encouraging incremental risk-taking. That said, participants should avoid reading too much into a single-day rebound and wait for stability above 24,900 to confirm a sustained recovery, with immediate support now placed in the 24,600–24,700 zone. For the next session, focus will remain on rate-sensitive sectors, particularly banking, financials, and auto, while metals and energy could also offer selective buying opportunities. Amid all, traders should avoid getting carried away and stick to a stock-specific approach.

"KPIT Tech higher by 3 percent after big fall, management assures on margin guidance",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/kpit-tech-higher-by-3-percent-after-big-fall-management-assures-on-margin-guidance-13592567.html,"Shares of KPIT Tech are sharply higher by over 3 percent on October 1, a day after a 10 percent fall, as the street assessed the management's assurance on margin guidance, citing the fall to a likely individual investor's stake sale. In a fresh note, JPMorgan told its investors in a note that the stock has caught up with the sector’s underperformance after the correction, and it may be time to buy the shares, however, it may take some more time to generate returns. The brokerage cut its target price for KPIT to Rs 1,400 compared to Rs 1,500 per share, assigning an Overweight call on the stock. Goldman Sachs trimmed its price target to Rs 1,100 per share, citing delayed business impact from recent deals, and has been expecting modest growth for H1FY26. Several broking houses are structurally positive on KPIT, backing its domain strength in mobility, and acquisitions to expand capabilities, alonf with an improving deal pipeline. In a conversation with CNBC-TV18, KPIT Tech attributed to the share price fall on September 30 to an individual investor's stake sale, adding that the company has no information on who the investor was. KPIT said the management has already shared a detailed view of its stance and there is no change in its financial projections. KPIT continues to maintain the previously issued guidance, and said it will not comment on any individual deal but assured that there is no risk to client deal renewals. The company reiterated its margin guidance, adding that growth is expected to pick up from Q3FY26 onwards. The company did not specify if it will provide a fresh guidance at the end of Q2FY26.

Experts pick 10 rate-sensitive stocks after RBI keeps rates unchanged,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/experts-pick-10-rate-sensitive-stocks-after-rbi-mpc-keeps-rates-unchanged-13592553.html,"The Reserve Bank of India Monetary Policy Committee (RBI MPC) has unanimously decided to keep the repo rate unchanged at 5.5 percent, while retaining the policy stance as neutral. The central bank wants to continue to observe the impact of previous policy actions and the recent fiscal measures (including GST, tax cuts) before charting the next course of action, though there has been a significant moderation in inflation. The RBI revised its full-year growth estimate upward to 6.8 percent (from 6.5 percent earlier), supported by domestic drivers and likely further support from a favourable monsoon, despite weak external demand. However, it lowered the growth projection for Q3FY26 (to 6.4 percent from 6.6 percent earlier), Q4 (6.2 percent from 6.3 percent), and Q1FY27 (6.4 percent from 6.6 percent), especially due to trade-related uncertainties. ""There has been a significant moderation in inflation. Moreover, the prevailing global uncertainties and tariff-related developments are likely to decelerate growth in H2:2025-26 and beyond. The current macroeconomic conditions and the outlook have opened up policy space for further supporting growth,"" the RBI said. The central bank has lowered its retail inflation estimate to 2.6 percent (from 3.1 percent earlier) for FY26, and also for Q1FY27 to 4.5 percent (from 4.9 percent). ""MPC’s decision on the repo rate and policy stance was largely in line with expectations, but the underlying message has significant implications for markets, liquidity, and the broader economy,"" said Anil Rego, Founder and Fund Manager at Right Horizons PMS. He believes the downward revision of the FY26 CPI inflation forecast reflects growing confidence that price pressures are well-anchored, aided by recent GST rationalization and easing input costs. This creates room for further monetary accommodation later, potentially as early as the December meeting, he said. The Bank Nifty staged a strong performance after the RBI policy decision, rising more than 1 percent to 55,251 at 12:41 hours IST, extending gains for the third consecutive session. This lent strong support to the benchmark indices, with the Nifty 50 climbing 156 points to 24,767 and the Sensex rising 524 points to 80,791 after witnessing a fall in the previous eight sessions. ""For markets, the status quo was largely priced in, but the tone of vigilance suggests rate cuts are unlikely before late 2025 or even 2026,"" said Sonam Srivastava, Founder and Fund Manager at Wright Research PMS. According to Sonam, equities should take comfort in policy continuity. ""Rate-sensitive sectors like autos, real estate, and financials could benefit at the margin, but the real drivers for the next leg of the rally remain global liquidity trends and corporate earnings momentum,"" she said. Moneycontrol collated a list of the top 10 rate-sensitive stocks, curated by experts with a 3–4-week perspective on the basis of the closing price of September 30, following the Reserve Bank of India's decision to maintain the status quo on rates. Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors Bank of Baroda | CMP: Rs 258.55 In Tuesday’s session, the PSU Banking sector managed to outshine the other sectors. Among them, Bank of Baroda was one of the top gainers, supported by a surge in volumes. On the daily chart, Bank of Baroda has already given a breakout from the triangle pattern and has also retested it, suggesting buying pressure from the trendline support. Along with this, as per the three candlestick rules, the trend is on the positive side as the high is above the prior day’s high, the low is above the prior day’s low, and the close is above the prior day’s high, which keeps the overall bias on the bullish side. A decisive break above Rs 260 levels could lead to a trending move towards Rs 271, followed by Rs 285 levels. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 271, Rs 285 Stop-Loss: Rs 249 Vatsal Bhuva, Technical Analyst at LKP Securities Bank of India | CMP: Rs 123.41 Notably, the PSU Bank index has shown strong performance despite the choppy market conditions in the previous session. Among stocks, Bank of India stands out with a bullish candlestick closing and a rounding pattern on the charts, closing above its resistance levels. Futures data reflect a long buildup for two sessions, and a breakout above Rs 125 could trigger momentum toward Rs 140. Immediate support lies at Rs 118, while resistance is placed at Rs 125. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 136 Stop-Loss: Rs 119 DLF | CMP: Rs 713 Real estate, being one of the rate-sensitive sectors, has seen notable moves, with DLF witnessing a steep fall from Rs 793 levels, which had earlier acted as a supply zone. The stock found support near Rs 710 levels, where positive divergence on the daily chart and extended positive divergence on the hourly chart suggest a pullback swing. RSI also signals bullish momentum with a crossover. Technically, a rebound towards Rs 750 levels is possible, aligning with the 20-day zone and Fibonacci retracement. Key support lies at Rs 700, while resistance is placed at Rs 750. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 750 Stop-Loss: 699 Vidnyan Sawant, Head – Research Desk at GEPL Capital Canara Bank | CMP: Rs 123.71 On the monthly scale, Canara Bank is witnessing a breakout from a large Cup and Handle pattern that has been forming since the 2010 swing top. This highlights a strong structural setup on the higher timeframes. The breakout in the current market environment further underscores the stock’s high relative strength. Additionally, the momentum indicator RSI is sustaining above the 60 mark across multiple timeframes, reinforcing the continuation of bullish momentum. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 134 Stop-Loss: Rs 118 Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Company | CMP: Rs 1,610.8 Cholamandalam Investment has been forming a sequence of higher tops and higher bottoms, indicating a sustained upward trajectory. The stock continues to trade firmly above key short- and medium-term moving averages, namely the 20-week and 50-week EMAs, reflecting the strength of the prevailing trend. On the daily scale, it is developing a base pattern, showcasing constructive structural development. Meanwhile, the RSI indicator is approaching the 60 level, signaling improving momentum. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,788 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,530 Riyank Arora, Technical Analyst at Mehta Equities Bajaj Finance | CMP: Rs 998.9 Bajaj Finance has retested its breakout price and is holding well above its earlier consolidation area, indicating strength in trend continuation. It is holding above its previous all-time highs backed by a visible spike in volume, indicating active institutional buying. RSI (14) at 59 is up and indicating a pick-up in momentum without going into an overbought zone, creating space for more upside. Price action shows a healthy risk–reward setup with higher highs and higher lows intact. Provided the Rs 950 stop price is honoured, the stock is capable of moving towards the Rs 1,100 level in the near term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,100 Stop-Loss: Rs 950 State Bank of India | CMP: Rs 872.45 SBI sustains its bullish momentum, validating a breakout from a rising wedge formation and holding above important resistance areas. Strength in momentum is evident from heavy volume activity as well, which is confirming this breakout. RSI (14) stands at 69, which is a good indication of strong momentum and is near its overbought region, but this price structure is indicating strength and not exhaustion. It is a good sign that this stock is sustaining above the breakout area, boosting continuation chances to around Rs 950. Any dip towards immediate support is a healthy consolidation sign, and that all-important figure of Rs 840 must be held to keep the overall bullish stance intact. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 950 Stop-Loss: Rs 840 Anshul Jain, Head of Research at Lakshmishree Investments Shriram Finance | CMP: Rs 616.1 Shriram Finance is showing an interesting technical setup that could excite traders. Over the past 24 days, the stock has formed a small cup-and-handle pattern, a classic bullish signal. Currently, it is making a higher low and edging closer to the neckline at Rs 640. A breakout above this level would not just confirm short-term strength but also open the gates for a bigger move. That’s because the stock is also tracking a larger cup-and-handle pattern, with its neckline around Rs 715. A move past that zone could unlock significant upside potential and attract strong market participation. Target: Rs 715 Stop-Loss: Rs 600 Axis Bank | CMP: Rs 1,131.6 Axis Bank is showing strength after filling its gap at Rs 1,154 and is now forming a higher low while retesting its previous swing high. A breach and sustained move above Rs 1,171 will confirm this higher low pattern, signaling fresh bullish momentum. If that happens, the stock looks poised to head toward Rs 1,240 levels in the near term. Volumes are steady, with higher activity on up days, which is a strong sign that buyers are supporting the move and helping the rally sustain further. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,240 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,100 HDFC Bank | CMP: Rs 951 HDFC Bank is displaying a strong technical setup with a triple bottom forming around the Rs 942 zone. The stock is showing follow-through strength after a Doji candle appeared two sessions ago, signaling a potential reversal. Importantly, volumes are tapering off on each round of selling, a clear sign of seller exhaustion. If the stock manages a sustained move above Rs 955, it will confirm bullish intent and open the path for a rally toward Rs 1,000–1,020 levels in the near term, offering traders a promising upside opportunity.

"UPI to remain free of any charges, says RBI guv Malhotra; Paytm stock jumps",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/upi-to-remain-free-of-any-charges-says-rbi-guv-malhotra-paytm-stock-jumps-13592629.html,"The Reserve Bank of India has no current proposal to impose charges on UPI transactions, Governor Sanjay Malhotra announced Wednesday during the post-policy presser. Addressing concerns about possible charges on digital payments, he clarified that UPI will continue to remain free for users under present policy. Governor Malhotra's statement reinforces the government and RBI’s stance of keeping UPI a zero-cost platform to encourage wider adoption of digital payments across the country. The statement comes at a time when UPI transactions continue to scale record highs, cementing India’s position as the world’s largest real-time payments market. Paytm (One 97 Communications) share price jumped over 2% shortly after the Governor's statement, and was trading at Rs 1,147 on NSE in the early afternoon session. Malhotra’s statement comes amid renewed speculation about the sustainability of UPI’s zero-cost model. He previously noted that “there are costs (associated with UPI transactions), and they need to be paid for by someone,” and acknowledged that UPI may not stay free forever. However, today he emphasized that no changes are being introduced now. Across the ecosystem, UPI has long been a largely free platform, with the government and RBI aiming to promote digital payments. The Payment and Settlement Systems Act and related guidelines currently prohibit charging fees from users or merchants for UPI transactions. In parliament earlier this year, the finance ministry also clarified there is no current plan to impose UPI transaction charges, responding to public concern after earlier comments."

Shriram Finance stock jumps over 5% after report of stake sale to Mitsubishi UFJ; company clarifies on speculation,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/shriram-finance-stock-gains-over-3-after-report-of-stake-sale-to-mitsubishi-ufj-company-clarifies-on-speculation-13592506.html,"Shriram Finance shares rose 5.2% percent on Wednesday to end at Rs 647.9, after a news report said Japan’s Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) is in advanced talks to acquire a 20 percent stake in the company. The proposed investment, estimated at Rs 23,200 crore ($2.61 billion), would be via a preferential allotment and not through a secondary sale of shares, according to news report, which cited unidentified sources. Shriram Finance said that it is unaware of any such stake acquisition or sale proposal. The report said MUFG and Shriram Finance have signed an exclusivity agreement on negotiations. It added that the Japanese lender -- which is the country’s largest by assets and already holds a 23.62 percent stake in Morgan Stanley -- could consider taking a higher stake in Shriram Finance, or even a controlling interest, over time. The development follows moves by other Japanese financial groups, including Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group’s 24.2 percent holding in Yes Bank. In response, Shriram Finance filed a clarification to the stock exchanges. The company said it had received a query from mainstream media about a potential majority stake sale, which it categorically denied. “We hereby in good faith wish to clarify that the Company is not aware of any such potential majority stake sale of equity shares of the Company by any shareholder(s) and no such shareholder(s) has approached the Company or expressed his/their intention to sell,” it said. The statement added that investors should disregard any misleading information circulated in the media. Brokerage CLSA shared an “Overweight” call on Shriram Finance with a target price of Rs 785 per share, noting the company’s Q1FY26 asset quality was better than feared despite weak macro sentiment. It expects a 15 percent EPS CAGR for FY25-27 and a return on equity of 16.5 percent by FY27. For the quarter ended June 30, Shriram Finance reported an 8.8 percent year-on-year rise in standalone profit to Rs 2,156 crore, slightly below analyst estimates of Rs 2,191 crore, according to LSEG data. At the current market price, the stock is down nearly 9.3 percent over the past year, compared with a 52-week range of Rs 493.35 to Rs 725.56. The company has a market capitalisation of about Rs 1.22 trillion, a price-to-earnings ratio of 12.7, and a dividend yield of 1.53 percent."

"Bank Nifty jumps 700 pts, Fin Nifty up 1.2% on RBI's lending, capital rules proposals",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/bank-nifty-jumps-600-pts-fin-nifty-up-1-2-on-rbi-s-lending-capital-rules-proposals-13592315.html,"The Bank Nifty reclaimed 55,000 mark on October 1 after the Reserve Bank of India kept the interest rate unchanged at 5.5 percent for the second consecutive time and the lender also proposed a raft of changes for bank lending. The sharp rally was led by Kotak Mahindra Bank, ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank, rising up to 3 percent intraday. At 12:05 pm on October 1, Bank Nifty was trading 700 points, or 1.3%, higher at 55,350. While the Nifty Private Bank index rose 1.75%, the Nifty PSU Bank index saw profit booking as it was trading 1.1% lower. Announcing the fourth bi-monthly monetary policy of the current fiscal, RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra said the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) unanimously decided to keep the short-term lending rate or repo rate unchanged at 5.5 percent with a neutral stance. RBI has proposed to expand scope of capital market lending by banks to provide enabling framework to finance acquisitions. The central bank on October 1 proposed to withdraw a 2016 framework that limited bank lending to large corporations in a bid to reduce the risk of concentrated lending. This change will allow banks to raise lending to large corporations. RBI also proposed greater flexibility to banks for opening and maintaining accounts of borrowers. The RBI allowed unfettered bank lending against listed debt securities and raised the limit for lending against equity shares. The cap on bank financing for IPOs will also be raised from to Rs 25 lakh from Rs 10 lakh per individual. Nifty Financial services index also rose over 1.4 percent to trade at 26,396 on October 1 as the central bank lowered the risk weights for infrastructure loans by non-bank lenders, allowing greater credit flow to the ongoing build-out of roads and bridges across the country. Shares of non-banking finance companies including HUDCO, IREDA, PFC and REC rose 3-5 percent on Wednesday after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced regulatory changes to ease infrastructure financing. Governor Sanjay Malhotra, while unveiling the October monetary policy, said risk weights on NBFC lending to operational, high-quality infrastructure projects would be reduced, helping lower the cost of financing for the sector. ""Harmonisation of over 9,000 compliances, a level-playing field for banks for capital market exposure and corporate acquisition, along with a dovish tone keeping the room open for future rate cuts, is in sync with the government's push to stimulate the economy,"" Nilesh Shah, managing director at Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company told Reuters. “As expected, the RBI maintained the status quo. RBI is biased towards growth since inflation is within the target range and continues moving towards the midpoint. Also, the tariff uncertainties causing some headwinds to global trade are also cause of concern. In this scenario, RBI would like to see some stabilization of the INR and some clarity on global trade. It is primed for future rate cuts but will depend on how things pan out on the global trade deals and volumes and the INR,"" said Vikas Gupta, CEO & Chief Investment Strategist at OmniScience Capital. Capital rules Giving banks a breather on capital, the RBI said the implementation of so-called expected credit loss rules, which mandate banks to set aside more funds for potential bad loans, will be effective on April 1, 2027. While a draft framework on the rules had been published to bring Indian norms in line with global ones, an implementation date had not been announced. Banks will be given time till March 31, 2031 to fully implement that framework, RBI governor Malhotra said. The central bank also proposed to make Basel 3 norms effective for banks from April 1, 2027. The RBI will also issue draft rules for credit risk shortly. Under these, lower risk weights on certain segments are expected to ease capital requirements for small enterprises and residential real estate, including home loans.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade SAIL, Bank of Baroda, Jindal Steel, Hindustan Zinc, Hero MotoCorp, and others on October 01?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-sail-bank-of-baroda-jindal-steel-hindustan-zinc-hero-motocorp-and-others-on-october-01-13591706.html,"Bears have retained their charge over the market, pulling the benchmark indices down for eight consecutive days. The Nifty 50 fell by 0.1 percent with weak market breadth. About 1,522 shares declined compared to 1,242 advancing shares on the NSE. The consolidation may continue until the market moves back above the short-term moving averages. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Amol Athawale, VP Technical Research at Kotak Securities SAIL | CMP: Rs 134.5 After a sharp uptrend rally, Steel Authority of India witnessed some selling pressure but eventually saw its downward momentum pause, finding support. On the weekly charts, the stock has formed a cup-and-handle pattern, and a fresh breakout from the resistance zone is very likely to occur in the coming trading sessions. As long as the stock is trading above Rs 130, the bullish trend is likely to continue. Above this level, the stock could move up to Rs 145. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 145 Stop-Loss: Rs 130 Britannia Industries | CMP: Rs 5,991 Following a decline from higher levels, Britannia rebounded from its support zone and witnessed a steady recovery. Additionally, on the daily charts, the stock has given a breakout from its sloping channel formation. The upward movement in the stock suggests a new leg of the bullish trend from current levels. For the next few trading sessions, Rs 5,790 could be the trend-deciding level for the bulls. If it sustains above this level, we can expect a further uptrend towards Rs 6,420. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 6,420 Stop-Loss: Rs 5,790 Tech Mahindra | CMP: Rs 1,400.3 On a broader time frame, Tech Mahindra has been in a prolonged downtrend, and it is currently in an oversold territory. The chart formation and technical indicators, such as the RSI, suggest that the stock is likely to rebound and start a new leg of upward movement from its lower levels. For positional traders, Rs 1,350 would be the decisive level. If the stock trades above this level, the uptrend formation will continue toward Rs 1,500. However, if it closes below Rs 1,350, traders may prefer to exit their long positions. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,500 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,350 Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors Hindustan Zinc | CMP: Rs 482.5 In the previous session, Hindustan Zinc managed to break out of its week-long consolidation between Rs 445 and Rs 469, gaining 3.5%, despite the broader indices falling. The stock filled the gap formed in June 2025, which suggests that bulls are getting active. Recently, prices found support at the mid-Bollinger band and are now trading above the upper bands, which is a sign of strength. The medium-term support for the stock is at Rs 453 levels. Additionally, the ADX is trading at 26, which is above 25, indicating that positive momentum is likely to continue in the stock. For now, one should use a buy-on-dips approach to ride the ongoing trend, which can push the stock toward targets of Rs 495, followed by Rs 520 levels. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 495, Rs 520 Stop-Loss: Rs 465 Jindal Steel | CMP: Rs 1,063.75 In the previous session, the Metal sector emerged as one of the top-performing sectors, with Jindal Steel standing out, gaining 2% and closing above the prior day's high, which is a bullish sign. However, prices are still stuck within a range of Rs 1,020–1,070 since September 8. Additionally, the Bollinger bands have started to shrink, indicating low volatility in the stock. Such periods of contraction are typically followed by periods of expansion. Hence, a breakout on the upside is expected, which could push prices to new fresh highs. A break above Rs 1,070 can trigger a fresh leg upward toward Rs 1,110, followed by Rs 1,145 levels. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,110, Rs 1,145 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,030 Arun Mantri, Founder of Mantri Finmart Bank of Baroda | CMP: 258.55 Bank of Baroda has been in strong bullish momentum, in line with the overall PSU Banking index, for the past few sessions. On the technical front, the RSI is above the major threshold, which may lead to price expansion, coupled with good trading volumes. Moreover, the MACD shows a strong bullish crossover, with a wide spread between the MACD and signal line. Immediate support for the stock is at Rs 250, while the trend remains positive as long as the price holds above the support zone and moves higher above Rs 280. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 282, Rs 288 Stop-Loss: Rs 245 Hero MotoCorp | CMP: Rs 5,472.5 Hero MotoCorp has witnessed good action in the past few weeks and is looking strong on the short-term time frame, trading well above its major short-term moving averages. The stock has broken out above Rs 5,400, with volumes showing an increasing trend over the past few trades, indicating growing traction in the counter. The Bollinger Band (20, 2) is also trading in comfortable zones, with both the RSI and MACD signaling bullish trends on the daily as well as the weekly time frames. The next resistance for the stock is around Rs 5,650–5,700 from a short-term perspective. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 5,645, Rs 5,680 Stop-Loss: Rs 5,367 Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Sectorally, PSU banks outperformed with the Nifty PSU Bank index climbing 1.9 percent. Metals and autos also gained, rising 1 percent and 0.5 percent, respectively. On the downside, Nifty Media fell 1 percent, while Realty and Consumer Durables shed 0.9 percent each. “Equities ended flat as investors largely stayed on the sidelines ahead of the RBI policy. Without fresh triggers, momentum remained subdued,” said Ponmudi R, CEO of Enrich Money. He added that the policy outcome will be pivotal in shaping expectations around rates, liquidity, and inflation. Technical experts flagged weakness in Nifty, which slipped toward 24,610 and faces support at 24,540. A breach could open the downside to 24,400, confirming a short-term negative trend. Investors are also awaiting September auto sales numbers, due October 1. Globally, sentiment was muted. In the US, fears of a government shutdown linger after talks between President Donald Trump and Congressional leaders ended without resolution. Failure to reach a deal by Wednesday could halt key government operations and delay economic data, including Friday’s non-farm payrolls. “The near-term market outlook is cautious, with indices likely to stay range-bound until clarity emerges on policy, tariffs, and the earnings season,” said Vinod Nair of Geojit Financial Services."

Buy Vedanta; target of Rs 525: Emkay Global Financial,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-vedanta-target-of-rs-525-emkay-global-financial-2-13590210.html,"Emkay Global Financial' research report on Vedanta Hindustan Zinc (HZ) is a key beneficiary of the uptrend in silver prices, which are up 63% YTD. We believe the exposure to silver is underpriced as the consensus expectations trail the strong move in silver in recent months with the metal now trading at USD47/oz (vs USD34/oz in Q1FY26 and USD30/oz in FY25). Global peers like Fresnillo and Grupo Mexico have already re-rated YTD, and we therefore see a strong potential for HZ to be repriced higher, to reflect current prices. HZ (not rated) contributes 40% to VEDL’s EBITDA and is the core part of the group portfolio. Per our calculations, a USD1/oz move in silver prices has 1% sensitivity to HZ’s EBITDA. Interestingly, silver is a by-product of zinc which implies that 88% of silver revenue is a direct pass-through to EBITDA as the cost of production remains tied to zinc production. Outlook We retain BUY on VEDL, with an unchanged TP of Rs 525.

Neutral TCI Express; target of Rs 730: Motilal Oswal,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/neutral-tci-express-target-of-rs-730-motilal-oswal-2-13590026.html,"Motilal Oswal's research report on TCI Express We maintain a neutral stance on TCI Express (TCIE) due to ongoing challenges in volume and profitability. TCIE is experiencing weak demand in certain industrial segments, including manufacturing, automobiles, and textiles, despite a healthy growth of ~22% YoY in e-way bill generation over Apr-Aug’25 and an 8.3% growth in the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) for manufacturing motor vehicles, trailers, and semi-trailers—a key segment for TCIE—during Apr-Jul’25. This weakness in demand indicates that intense competition has hit TCIE’s business performance and volume growth. While management expects an 8–9% tonnage (vs. a 1% volume dip in FY25) and 11–12% revenue growth in FY26, the margin improvement target could face challenges from persistent cost pressures, inflationary labor expenses, and relatively lower margins in international air express. TCIE has also planned a capex of INR2.8b over FY26-27, which would mainly be for sorting center automation and network expansion, as dependence on higher-margin multimodal segments could pose risks if demand recovery is slower than anticipated. Outlook While the long-term outlook for surface express services remains positive, near-to-medium-term headwinds such as heightened competition and elevated freight costs are likely to weigh on margins and volumes. We expect TCIE to achieve an 8%/9%/20% volume/revenue/EBITDA CAGR over FY25-27. We reiterate our Neutral rating with a TP of INR730 (based on 22x FY27 EPS).

GST rate reductions will further boost the FMCG sector from 3QFY26 onward. Favorable monsoon, easing inflation and other govt. measures will also boost demand. More than 85% of NEST’s portfolio has benefited from GST 2.0, though the transition is likely to take time due to old inventory in trade channel. Few more weeks will be needed to clear off the entire old inventory. After 22nd Sep, NEST has instructed its trade partners to sell even old inventory at the revised GST rate. Even price packs of old inventory have seen temporary MRP reduction to pass on the benefits. Outlook The stock is trading at 68x/58x FY26E/FY27E EPS.

Buy Astral; target of Rs 1650: Motilal Oswal,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-astral-target-of-rs-1650-motilal-oswal-13589996.html,"Motilal Oswal's research report on Astral We interacted with the management of Astral (ASTRA) to discuss the industry outlook, growth prospects for its business, profitability outlook, and other focus areas. Here are the key takeaways from the discussion: The company plans to start its CPVC resin plant in Sep’26, leveraging low-cost operational capacity in India, where supply is currently limited. This backward integration is expected to boost margins, create barriers to entry for new competitors, and support the doubling of CPVC volumes over the next five years. OPVC pipes are experiencing muted demand in 1HY26 due to heavy rainfall and lower government orders, but it's expected to pick up post-Diwali. Demand in the long term is expected to come from contractors and government projects. BIS certification requirements are likely to benefit organized players by keeping inferior products out of the market. Outlook We model a 15%/17%/22% CAGR in sales/EBITDA/Adj. PAT over FY25-28E, led by an increase in capacity, backward integration of CPVC resins, levy of ADD on PVC resins, and gradual scale-up of new businesses.

"PVR INOX, Prime Focus decline up to 5% as Trump to impose 100% tariffs on films made outside US",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/pvr-prime-focus-others-decline-up-to-5-on-trump-s-100-tariff-announcement-on-non-us-made-movies-13589634.html,"Shares of media and entertainment companies declined on Tuesday after US President Donald Trump announced a 100 percent tariff on movies made outside the United States. ""Our movie-making business has been stolen from the United States of America, by other Countries, just like stealing ‘candy from a baby’,"" Trump posted on Truth Social on Monday. ""To solve this long time, never ending problem, I will be imposing a 100 percent Tariff on any and all movies that are made outside of the United States,"" he added. The move is expected to impact the Indian film industry, which exports films in multiple languages to the US, where they enjoy significant popularity among the diaspora. The Nifty Media index fell over 1 percent, with seven of its 10 constituents trading in the red. Prime Focus was the top loser, slipping 5 percent to hit the lower circuit at Rs 175.94 on the NSE. PVR INOX dropped up to 3 percent to Rs 1,072.1, while Mukta Arts declined nearly 2 percent to Rs 68. Trump had first floated the tariff threat in May. However, no timeline has been given for its implementation. Analysts said it remains unclear how such tariffs would be enforced, given that movies and television shows are also distributed digitally. Questions also remain on how the measure would apply to US films shot in foreign locations. The announcement comes close on the heels of fresh tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on pharmaceutical products.

Dixon Tech forays into lithium-ion batteries in a step toward backward integration,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/dixon-tech-forays-into-lithium-ion-batteries-in-a-step-toward-backward-integration-13589664.html,"Dixon Tech, a leading manufacturing partner of major electronics brands such as Samsung, Xiaomi, HP, Lenovo and others, has forayed into the manufacturing of lithium-ion batteries, battery packs and modules, in a step toward backward integration and cost efficiency. The company had recently set up a wholly owned subsidiary - Dixon Electrocorp - for which the subscription money was paid on September 29, 2025, subscribing to the equity shares of the company for a cash consideration. ""The wholly owned subsidiary has been incorporated with an object to undertake manufacturing and dealing in, inter-alia, all kind of electronic related products including batteries, lithium-ion (“Li-ion”) battery, li-ion battery cell, Li-ion Cells for digital applications, battery pack and battery modules, related products, equipment and components thereof,"" the company filing said. Dixon Share Selloff Shares of Dixon Tech are sharply lower by over 3.5 percent on September 30. While the setting up of a wholly owned subsidiary to make lithium-ion batteries will be a positive step for Dixon Technologies, investors and analysts may wait for more clarity in terms of execution plan and project details, which may keep the gains in the share price checked. Over the last five trading sessions, the shares of Dixon Tech are down by over 11 percent. Incentive Under ECMS Earlier this year, the Cabinet had approved the Electronics Component Manufacturing Scheme with a funding of Rs 22,919 crore to become more self reliance in the electronics supply chain. As part of the scheme, the domestic manufacturing of li-ion cells for digital applications, excluding storage and mobility were to be incentivized. The scheme provided differentiated incentives to manufacturers to acquire technological capabilities and economies of scale, Centre had said in March 2025 during the launch of the scheme. The scheme had proposed to attract investment of Rs 59,350 crore into the electronics component manufacturing ecosystem, targetting production of Rs 4.56 lakh crore worth of goods and generate additional direct employment of over 91,000 persons. ""We see ECMS, that's Electronic Component Manufacturing Scheme, a scheme launched on 8th of April by the government of India as a strong enabler for backward integration, cost efficiency and low value, long-term value creation and have committed to leverage this scheme to enhance capabilities and contribute to India's goal of becoming a global hub for electronic manufacturing,"" Atul Lall had said in May 2025, soon after the scheme was notified. Capex Plans After the announcement of the component PLI scheme, Dixon Tech had been in active discussions with technology partners for camera modules, lithium-ion batteries, and other components. The step is seen as a move to expand Dixon’s presence in electronic product manufacturing. The company had executed a capex of nearly Rs 900 crore during FY25, and for FY26, the management has projected a similar range of around Rs 900-1,000 crore, for which the company has 'adequate cash flows and credit lines' to support the plans. ""We are significantly foraying into electronics component manufacturing as the next major phase of its growth & backward integration strategy,"" Dixon Tech has said in recent past. Future Outlook Commenting on the outlook going forward, Dixon Tech said in its annual report that the company is looking to 'further deepen' the level of manufacturing and scouting for partnerships in precision components, camera modules, and also battery packs. These efforts, the company said, will strengthen 'backward integration capabilities' and service the larger industry requirement, besides create a 'moat' for Dixon. The company also has plans to set up a display fab facility."

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade BSE, Bank of Baroda, Tech Mahindra, Axis Bank, GMDC, Usha Martin, and others on September 30?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-bse-bank-of-baroda-tech-mahindra-axis-bank-gmdc-usha-martin-and-others-on-september-30-13589102.html,"The benchmark indices finished the session 0.08 percent down on September 29, with market breadth slightly favouring bears. About 1,459 shares declined compared to 1,335 shares that gained on the NSE. The market is expected to see some consolidation in the upcoming sessions after the recent sharp downmove. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi BSE | CMP: Rs 2,097.4 BSE has experienced a significant correction of around 33 percent from its peak, translating to roughly Rs 1,000. Currently, the stock is trading between the 50% and 61.8% retracement levels of its prior upward move, which coincides with its previous breakout zone, providing a potential support area. On the daily chart, the RSI has formed a bullish divergence, indicating a possible slowdown in selling pressure and hinting at a potential bounce. This combination of technical support and momentum signals suggests that BSE may stabilize or witness a short-term recovery in the coming sessions. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 2,100–2,050 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,345 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,940 Bank of Baroda | CMP: Rs 254 Bank of Baroda has established a strong base near its 50-period EMA on the weekly chart, providing a solid support foundation. Recently, it broke out from this consolidation, supported by decent trading volumes, indicating healthy buying interest. On the momentum front, the weekly RSI has broken above its falling trendline and is comfortably trading above 50, signaling strengthening bullish momentum. Additionally, the MACD has generated a bullish crossover above the zero line, further confirming the positive trend. Together, these technical signals suggest that the stock is likely to continue its upside trajectory in the medium term. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 254–248 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 275 Stop-Loss: Rs 237 MRPL | CMP: Rs 134.11 After a consolidation range between Rs 125 and Rs 132, Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals (MRPL) has broken out and is currently trading near the Rs 134 level on strong volumes, indicating robust buying interest. During the consolidation, the daily RSI remained around the 50 mark, reflecting equilibrium between buyers and sellers and preventing any significant weakness. This steady momentum, combined with the breakout on volume, reinforces the bullish case for the stock. These technical signals suggest that MRPL is well-positioned for further upside movement in the coming sessions. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 135–133 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 150 Stop-Loss: Rs 126 Jay Thakkar, Vice President & Head of Derivatives and Quant Research at ICICI Securities Axis Bank | CMP: Rs 1,132.2 Axis Bank has outperformed the Nifty Private Sector Bank index in the short term. It bounced back sharply on the back of short covering; however, it didn’t surpass its previous swing high of Rs 1,256+ levels, and until that happens, the overall bias remains negative for the stock. The open interest in futures fell when the price recovered, indicating short covering. The options data suggests that the Rs 1,200 strike has the highest Call base, and it looks unlikely that the stock will surpass this level in the short term. The stock has also fallen below its maximum pain level, which is negative in the near term. Sell Axis Bank October Futures in the range of Rs 1,150–1,130. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 1,090, Rs 1,050 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,190 Larsen & Toubro | CMP: Rs 3,688.4 Larsen & Toubro (L&T) seems to be breaking out of a consolidating range with an increase in open interest in the futures segment, which indicates long build-up. Hence, the short-term outlook is positive. There is a significant Call base in the Rs 3,700–3,800 range, which may act as a hurdle; however, the Rs 3,600 and Rs 3,700 strikes have witnessed strong Put additions, which will act as support. Hence, a continuation on the upside is likely, and traders can adopt a bullish strategy for the October series in L&T. Buy L&T October Futures in the range of Rs 3,700–3,740. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,850, Rs 3,920 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,630 Tech Mahindra | CMP: Rs 1,410.7 Tech Mahindra has again witnessed a short build-up, as with the fall in price there has been an increase in open interest in futures, which is negative for the stock in the near term. The Nifty IT index overall looks bearish in the short to medium term; hence, it is unlikely that this stock will make a lifetime high or outperform the Nifty going forward. The stock has a huge Call base at the Rs 1,500 strike, and until it closes above this level, the overall trend is likely to remain sideways to negative. The stock is also trading below its maximum pain level, which is also negative in the near term. Sell Tech Mahindra October Futures in the range of Rs 1,400–1,430. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 1,330, Rs 1,280 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,465 Vidnyan S Sawant, Head of Research at GEPL Capital Anant Raj | CMP: Rs 699.15 Anant Raj hit a lifetime high of Rs 947 in January 2025 before correcting to Rs 376, where it formed a Change in Polarity (CIP) and resumed its bullish structure with higher highs and higher lows on the monthly chart.

"Fresh Trump tariffs, what is at stake for Indian pharma, and the playbook to survive",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/fresh-trump-tariffs-what-is-at-stake-for-indian-pharma-and-the-playbook-to-survive-13588672.html,"US President Trump’s recent announcement of a 100 percent tariff on import of branded and patented pharma products, starting October 1, has rattled the global supply chains of drugmakers. While generic drugs have been exempted, there are alarm bells across Indian pharma space too, which exported nearly $10 billion worth of drugs to the US during FY25 or 35 percent of its total pharmaceutical shipments abroad. The immediate impact may be limited, but the broader implications could be far-reaching, and among Indian drugmakers, Sun Pharma may be particularly vulnerable owing to its significant presence in the US specialty branded drug business. Uncertainty Over Exemptions Trump administration’s Section 232 investigation - a national security probe into pharmaceutical imports – has cast a long shadow, covering the import of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), key starting materials and potentially generic drugs. A final report is expected by December 27, 2025, with a presidential decision due by March 2026. The industry is watching closely, aware that exemptions can be temporary, and policy winds may shift very quickly. Generics: The Political Minefield Imported generics have so far managed to escape Trump’s glare likely due to their critical role in keeping US healthcare costs in check. The Association for Accessible Medicines (AAM), representing US generic and biosimilar manufacturers, has warned that tariffs on generics would be disastrous. “Tariffs on generics would raise prices, worsen drug shortages, and threaten the viability of low-margin products,” AAM said in its latest report. The group, in partnership with IQVIA, revealed that FDA-approved generics and biosimilars saved the US healthcare system $467 billion in 2024, and $3.4 trillion over the last decade. Biosimilars alone contributed $20.2 billion in savings last year. With healthcare inflation being politically sensitive - especially in an election cycle, analysts believe Trump may tread carefully before extending import tariffs to generics. Make in America: A Costly Proposition Even if the administration pushes for domestic manufacturing, the path is likely to be uphill, say many analysts. Building a pharmaceutical plant in the US is a multi-year effort, requiring regulatory approvals, validation of equipment, build pilot or stability batches, workforce training, and supply chain setup. “Shifting manufacturing to the US is not feasible for the majority of Indian pharma companies,” said Prashant Khadayate, Director, Healthcare, GlobalData. “However, big players from India would certainly evaluate options to set up or expand their manufacturing base in the US based on their market presence,” Khadayate added. Margins are another constraint, according to Sudarshan Jain, Secretary General of the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA), who said, “Indian companies typically operate on razor-thin margins.” Most Indian firms earn 10-15% margins on their base business with higher returns only in limited competition generics. Defence Strategy Indian pharma is not waiting for the axe to fall, and experts say a multi-pronged defence strategy by key players is already in motion. Companies like Alembic Pharma are pursuing backward integration and cost optimization to strengthen supply chain resilience, whiel others are diversifying geographically. Natco Pharma, for instance, acquired a 35.75 percent stake in South Africa’s Adcock Ingram for Rs 2,000 crore to reduce US dependence. Lupin is expanding its European footprint, and announced a €190 million acquisition of VISUfarma, a specialty ophthalmology firm with operations across the EU and UK. Indian firms are also investing in US manufacturing assets, with Aurobindo Pharma acquiring Lannett Company for $250 million while Syngene International has bought its first US biologics facility for $36.5 million. Cohance Life Sciences has also made similar moves. Consulting firms such as Oliver Wyman are helping Indian pharma clients prepare for worst-case scenarios, with their playbook including China+1 sourcing, digital analytics, and M&A opportunities. “Clearly, we want to diversify,” said Rajeev Nannapaneni, Vice Chairman and CEO of Natco Pharma. “We want to have a good geographical spread and strengthen our core business.” ""Indian pharma companies are capable enough to make necessary changes to their business model to minimize the impact,"" Khadayate of GlobalData said. The Road Ahead Analysts agree that product innovation, diversification of manufacturing and backward integration of pharma supply chains are key to long-term sustainability. “This move (import tariff) underscores the need for Indian pharma companies to diversify markets and innovate in complex generics and biosimilars to stay resilient in a changing global trade landscape,” said Deepak Jotwani, VP & Sector Head, ICRA. “To navigate this, Indian firms will need to localize parts of their trial support in the US, consider licensing IP to American partners, and diversify filings toward Europe and ASEAN,” said Suketu Thanawala, Partner, StraCon Business Advisory. “On the policy front, India must push for tariff carve-outs in trade negotiations, secure IP-safe zones in future free trade agreements (FTAs) and extend tax incentives to accelerate domestic innovation. Unless addressed quickly, this tariff could mark the beginning of a deeper decoupling,” added Thanawala. There are some industry proposals as well to bring down tariffs on US pharmaceutical imports to zero, in a bid to placate Washington and preserve access to the world’s largest drug market."

Click to View More Outlook for September 30 Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities Nifty continued to face selling pressure for the seventh day on trot on Monday and closed the day with minor loss amidst high volatility. After opening on a positive note, the market made an attempt to move up in the early part of the session. Selling pressure has emerged on every intraday rise on Monday and Nifty finally closed near the day's low. A reasonable negative candle was formed on the daily chart with upper shadow. Technically, this market action indicates an inability of bulls to sustain the bounce back and this also signal possibility of some more weakness in the coming sessions. Nifty is currently nearing an important support zone of around 24500-24400 levels (previous swing lows and 200day EMA) and this area could be reached in the next few sessions. However, any sustainable move above the hurdle of 24800-24900 levels could confirm near term bottom reversal pattern. Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets started the week on a volatile note and ended almost unchanged, taking a breather after the recent slide. Following a flat start, the Nifty oscillated sharply on both sides before finally settling at 24,634.90. On the sectoral front, a mixed trend kept traders engaged, with realty, energy, and metal posting gains, while auto and FMCG ended muted. In line with the benchmark, the broader indices also closed on a flat note. On one hand, the overhang of recent U.S. policy actions has eased slightly; however, persistent foreign fund outflows and caution ahead of the MPC meeting continue to weigh on sentiment. We believe oversold positions may now lead to some consolidation in the Nifty, with strong support around the 24,400–24,500 zone and resistance placed at 24,800–25,000. In the meantime, participants should focus on selective stock opportunities aligned with sectoral trends while keeping position sizes under check.

However, 7% decline in Kumiai’s (innovator) guidance on sales of pyroxa for Nov’24-Oct’25, is likely to affect PI’s CSM segment with revenue clocking 6% CAGR in FY25–28E compared with 21% CAGR in the past 5 years. The pharma business, still in ramp-up, is projected to grow ~70% in FY26 and break even by FY28 at ~Rs5bn revenue. The domestic business is expected to deliver ~6% CAGR, led by biologicals, while core formulations remain subdued. We estimate consolidated revenue/EBITDA/PAT CAGR at ~7%/8%/7% over FY25–28E, supported by new CSM launches, biologicals and pharma scale-up. Outlook At 28x FY27E EPS, the stock is trading slightly above its sector average. While R&D spending (3% of sales) remains strong, we await the next spark that could once again spur investors’ interests. We initiate coverage on PI with ‘HOLD’ recommendation and TP of Rs3,618 (28x Sep’27 EPS).

Hold SRF; target of Rs 2947: Prabhudas Lilladher,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/hold-srf-target-of-rs-2947-prabhudas-lilladher-13587238.html,"Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on SRF Based on investigation of Apr’23-Mar’24 data, Indian government has applied anti-dumping duty (ADD) of ~USD4,500/mt on import of R134a from China. SRF is the only manufacturer of R134a in India. However, currently, the difference between import-export realizations has already narrowed down, which would limit the benefit of ADD. Our estimate suggests that for every USD1/kg benefit in domestic realization, impact on FY27 EBITDA would be ~2%. For every 1,000mt additional sales, the impact would also be limited to ~2% of EBITDA. Outlook The stock is trading at 43x FY27 EPS. Based on SOTP, valuing the chemicals segment at 27x FY27 EV/EBITDA and packaging and technical textiles at 11x, we arrive at a target of Rs2,947 (earlier Rs3,071). In our earlier note, we had highlighted how R32 prices are likely to come down. Bearing the same in mind, we re-iterate our Hold rating on the stock.

Drug maker Wockhardt rallies over 9 percent as White House exempts pharma imports from nations with trade pacts,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/drug-maker-wockhardt-rallies-over-9-percent-as-white-house-exempts-pharma-imports-from-nations-with-trade-pacts-13587233.html,"Shares of Wockhardt are higher by more than 9 percent on September 29, marking its best day in nearly four months, as investors added bets after clarification emerged that US President Trump's fresh tariff on branded pharma imports will not apply to countries with which American has negotiated agreements - a relief for the European Union and Japan - a move that is expected to help the Indian drugmaker which has manufacturing facilities in Europe. Wockhardt had acquired French firm Negma to strengthen manufacturing capacity in Europe for formulations and APIs, aside of manufacturing and injectable facility in North Wales, UK. The drug maker has presence in USA, UK, Ireland, Switzerland, Mexico, Russia and many other countries, with research facilities in India and UK, and a manufacturing facility in Ireland. Wockhardt has a significant present in Europe and India with nearly 78 percent of its global revenue coming from international businesses. Exemptions for US Trade Partners? While announcing the pharma tariffs, Trump did not specify if the levies would apply over and above the existing tariffs as defined with trade agreements with EU and Japan, and the UK. On September 26, Bloomberg News quoted a US government official who said duties on pharma imports from EU will not exceed 15 percent, as is the tariff framework of the deal. Drug imports from Japan too will be levied the rate defined by the trade pact, said the official. EU Commission's deputy spokesperson Olof Gill had on Friday cited the trade agreement as an 'insurance' against Trump's fresh and higher tariffs on pharma imports into US. “This clear all-inclusive 15% tariff ceiling for EU exports represents an insurance policy that no higher tariffs will emerge for European economic operators. The EU is the only trade partner to achieve this outcome with the US,” Olof Gill had said. Read More: Generic medicines exempted from Trump’s 100% pharma tariffs, but uncertainty continues No Impact of Trump Tariffs on Zaynich Wockhardt has said that Zaynich, the company’s investigational drug which has cured complex case of meningitisunder compassionate use, has achieved over 97 percent efficacy in clinic study for serious infections, and is being manufactured in Europe. Given the drug falls under the ambit of tariffs applicable under local trade agreement, Wockhardt has said that the Trump tariffs on pharmaceuticals 'will not have significant impact' on the molecule. ""Our new molecules, like Zaynich, which we would be going to rest as our first drug, the product is entirely manufactured in Europe, and therefore it will not be covered by Indian tariffs, and it would be covered by the European tariffs,"" Chairman Hablil Khorakiwala said during an interaction with CNBC-TV18 on the day Trump's pharma tariffs were announced. ""There are approaches available whereby one can reduce the impact of tariffs significantly."" Khorakiwala also said that the application for a USFDA filing by the company for Zaynich is expected this week. ""...generally the FDA takes about 9 to 12 months for approval. So, we expect by middle of next year to be launching in the US and subsequently, in H2 of next year to file in various in Europe and emerging markets,"" Murtuza Khorakiwla, MD of Wockhardt had said during the June quarter earnings call. Wockhardt's Global Footprint The drugmaker is amongst the top three Indian generic companies in UK, and sixth largest generic supplier in retailand hospital channel in Ireland. Wockhardt's new drugs, including Zaynich and Miqnaf - used to treat multi-drug resistant pathogens - is expected to contribute a 'fairly significant' to the company’s revenue from FY27 onwards, Khorakiwala has said in the past. Going forward, the drugmaker plans on pivot to become a novel drugmaker and is re-engineering to cater to newer therapies. The pharma company's novel antibiotic portfolio including Zaynich, Miqnaf and Emrok, and, over the next 3-5 years, Wockhardt is developing even more insulin analogs like semaglutide. Despite the surge in the share price this year, Wockhardt has been flat for this year, and up by 48 percent compared to last one year."

"Pharma stocks rebound as tariff fears ease; Sun Pharma, Lupin, Cipla lead gains",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/pharma-stocks-rebound-as-tariff-fears-ease-sun-pharma-lupin-cipla-lead-gains-13587063.html,"The Nifty Pharma index climbed 1 percent on September 29, breaking a five-day losing streak as most constituents traded higher. The rebound followed a sharp sell-off last week after US President Donald Trump announced steep 100 percent tariffs on branded and patented drugs starting October 1, part of its broader push to onshore pharma manufacturing, create jobs, and cut foreign reliance. Out of the 20 index stocks, 15 advanced, led by Sun Pharma, Lupin, Cipla, Zydus Life, Biocon, Granules India, Torrent Pharma, Laurus Labs, Aurobindo Pharma, and Glenmark Pharma, which gained up to 2 percent. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog Analysts pointed out that since India primarily exports generic drugs to the US, which remain outside the tariff ambit, the recent weakness was largely sentiment-driven. HSBC said only Sun Pharma has meaningful exposure to patented medicines in the US, adding that while the worst-case earnings hit could be 8 to 10 percent by FY27, it maintained a “Buy” call on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,850 per share. Jefferies also highlighted Sun Pharma and Biocon as the most exposed but noted that generic exports and Indian CRDMO supplies are unlikely to be impacted, even as contradictions with recent trade pacts mean clarity on the tariff structure is still awaited. According to Pharmexcil, the US accounts for over 35 percent of India’s total pharma exports, valued at $10 billion in FY25. For several leading drug makers, the US remains their largest market, contributing as much as 40–50 percent of revenues. For example, Dr Reddy’s derives 47 percent of its earnings from the US, while Sun Pharma earns 37 percent. Lupin, Zydus Lifesciences, and Aurobindo Pharma each generate over $1 billion in revenues from the US market alone. In short, if tariffs are eventually extended to complex generics and specialty medicines, the impact on Indian pharma companies could be significant.

"Bharat Electronics top Nifty gainer on Army's likely RFP for QRSAM system, or the Anant Shashtra air defence",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/bharat-electronics-top-nifty-gainer-on-receiving-army-s-rfp-for-qrsam-system-or-the-anant-shashtra-air-defence-13587062.html,"Shares of state-owned Bharat Electronics were sharply higher by more than 2 percent to emerge as the top gainer on Nifty 50 index, following reports over the weekend that the defence PSU has received the much-awaited Request For Proposal (RFP) from the Indian Army to supply Quick Reaction Surface-to-Air Missiles (QRSAM) for an new air defence system to be inducted as 'Anant Shastra' cover. Over the weekend, news agency ANI had reported that the tender has been opened to develop the ambitious missile system, costing about Rs 30,000 crore, to enhance the air defence along the western and northern borders. BEL Invited for QRSAM RFP It is expected that the tender has sought a formal invitation for proposal, also known as Request for Proposal (RFP) for 5-6 regiments of Anant Shastra (QRSAM) systems has been sought, which could result in an order for BEL if the Army accepts BEL's bid. BEL manufactures Quick Reaction Surface to Air Missiles (QRSAM) capable of 'search on move, track on move and fire on short halts', according to the company. For the QRSAM, the approval of Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) was received in July 2025, which BEL had called as 'good progress' during its June quarter earnings call. Now, the RFP has to be issued to the company. ""We are confident to get this order by February, March as of now..."" BEL had said in June. Major Order by Q4FY26 ""It may not slip to Q1 of next year. We are confident we may get in the Q4 of this year itself QRSAM because the progress looks really good for us and DAC approval already has come,"" BEL added, sounding confident of bagging 'major portion' of the order, some of which will 'spill over to Q1FY27 also, but majority of the orders are expected in Q3 and Q4FY26. For the project, DRDO (Defence Research and Development Organisation) is the lead developer with Bharat Electronics providing the radars and electronic systems while Bharat Dynamics will be responsible for the production of the missile systems. There are likely other private partners, too, including L&T, which will be contributing to the launcher and other sub-systems. BEL had said that it is confident of cornering a 'considerable portion' of orders for sub-systems for the project, even though Procurement and Compliance (P&C) related details are being worked out. ""So, we have already started discussing with them about the configuration, final effect about the final bomb. So those activities are going on at a good pace. So we are hoping in the next 3 to 6 months, we will get a considerable portion of subsystems order with us. So that is a -- good progress is there, but this is having some five, six different types of subsystems,"" Manoj Jain, CMD of BEL had said during the June quarter earnings call. BEL already has an orderbook of over Rs 80,000 crore, and the QRSAM project is expected to be a major contributor to the future order pipeline for the company. The PSU has been developing systems and testing them jointly with DRDO, along with other subsystems involved in the project. BEL's annual revenue is nearing Rs 30,000 crore, and with an orderbook of around Rs 27000 crore, the management is confident of a -15 percent revenue growth projection going forward, even at this large base. ""So, I don't see 16-17 percent will be a challenge for me, but definitely it will not go below 15 percent, that much I can assure you. It will be between 15-17 percent, 17.5-18 percent, somewhere, we will try to stabilize around that type of a growth pattern based on the order inflow and type of projects where we are involved right now,"" CMD Manoj Jain had said in June 2025. Boost to India's Air Defence With a range of around 30 km, this proposed air defence system is expected to complement the existing MRSAM and Akash missile system in the short and medium ranges. As per ANI, this air defence system is being put to trial for night operations as well. The project is part of Army's preparedness against drone and missile threats on the western border, as was seen during the recent Op Sindoor against terror targets inside Pakistan during May 2025, where India's air defences had thwarted the use of Chinese-made missiles and Turkish drones along the border. Brokerage View Motilal Oswal in a note on September 29 said Bharat Electronics is currently at 48.2x and 40.3x the FY26e and FY27e EPS and maintained its Buy call on the stock with a two-year target price of Rs 490 per share, which is around 24 percent higher from current levels. ""Our estimates already factor in large-sized order inflows from QRSAM and next-generation corvettes to materialize between FY26 and FY27. We also bake in longer gestation period for these orders and expect a sales/EBITDA/PAT CAGR of 18%/17%/17% over FY25-28,"" said MOSL. The note highlighted some key risks to the outlook, citing a slowdown in order inflows, rising competition, or delays in the finalization of tenders, along with a rise in commodity prices among key factors.

IT stocks also plunged on weak growth outlook from Accenture.

Here is how financial markets across the globe fared overnight: GIFT Nifty (Gains) The GIFT Nifty is trading higher at around 24,827.50, indicating a strong start for the day. Asian Equities (Mixed) Asian markets were trading mixed in the early trade on Monday with Topix down 1.6 percent, while Kospi up 1.4 percent. US Equities (Up) Gains in Wall Street indexes on Friday were not enough to erase a loss for the week while resilient consumer spending supported longer-dated Treasury yields and gold rose as a steady inflation reading supported bets on future Federal Reserve rate cuts. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.65%, the S&P 500 rose 0.59% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.44%. US Bond Yield (Flat) The yield on 10-year Treasuries down 2 basis points at 4.16 percent, while 2-year Treasuries were down 1 basis points at 3.62 percent.

Asian currencies (Gain) Except China Renminbi, all other Asian currencies gained in the early trade on Monday with South Korean Won leading the gainers followed by Malaysian Ringgit, Indonesian Rupiah, Taiwan Dollar, Japanese Yen. Crude (Slips) Oil prices slipped nearly 1% on Monday after Iraq's Kurdistan region resumed crude oil exports via Turkey over the weekend and as OPEC+ plans another oil output hike in November, adding to global supplies. Gold (Gains) Gold edged higher — after notching a sixth weekly gain — as traders weighed a potential US government shutdown that could delay the release of pivotal jobs data this week and potentially cloud the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy path.

A total of 2,337 shares saw selling pressure compared to 460 advancing shares on the NSE. The market may see a bounce-back after the significant selling pressure of last week, but sustainability is the key to watch. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Rajesh Palviya, Senior Vice President Research (Head Technical Derivatives) at Axis Securities Ashok Leyland | CMP: Rs 141.93 Ashok Leyland is in a strong uptrend across all time frames, forming a series of higher tops and bottoms. On the weekly chart, the stock has also confirmed a ""rounding bottom"" formation breakout at Rs 134 levels on a closing basis. This breakout is accompanied by huge volumes, which signifies increased participation. The stock is well-placed above its 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-day SMAs, which reconfirms a bullish trend, and these averages are also inching up along with the price rise. The weekly Bollinger Bands buy signal indicates increased momentum. The weekly and monthly strength indicator RSI also indicates rising strength. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 150, Rs 157 Stop-Loss: Rs 135 Minda Corporation | CMP: Rs 571.3 Since August 2024, Minda Corporation has been consolidating within the Rs 550–450 range; however, with last week's close, the stock has decisively surpassed the weekly down-sloping trendline resistance at Rs 562 levels, along with huge volumes, which signals the resumption of the prior uptrend. Currently, the stock is well-placed above its 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-day SMAs, which reconfirms a bullish trend. The daily, weekly, and monthly strength indicator RSI indicates rising strength. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 607, Rs 640 Stop-Loss: Rs 555 Larsen & Toubro | CMP: Rs 3,730 With Friday's strong movement, Larsen & Toubro has decisively surpassed the past 8–9 months' multiple resistance zone of Rs 3,700 levels on a closing basis. Huge volumes on this breakout signify increased participation. The stock is well-placed above its 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-day SMAs, and these averages are also inching up along with the price rise, which reconfirms a bullish trend. The daily Bollinger Band buy signal indicates increased momentum. The daily and weekly strength indicator RSI indicates rising strength. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,855, Rs 3,950 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,700 Osho Krishan, Chief Manager - Technical & Derivative Research at Angel One NTPC | CMP: Rs 337.9 NTPC has recently undergone a notable resurgence, marked by a multi-week breakout observed on the daily chart. The stock has ascended above the 200-day SMA and has also demonstrated a positive crossover among the short-term EMAs. Furthermore, the stock has displayed early indicators of a trend reversal on the SuperTrend indicator, bolstering the bullish outlook. In addition, the MACD signal line has experienced a positive crossover near the zero line, which contributes to the overall bullish sentiment. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 355, Rs 358 Stop-Loss: Rs 322 Shipping Corporation of India | CMP: Rs 225.45 SCI has demonstrated a notable increase over the past week, with a surge in trading volumes, culminating in a sloping trendline breakout on the daily charts. This upward movement has been supported by positive crossovers among the short- and medium-term EMAs. Moreover, the stock exhibits a secular upward trend in its daily chart structure, signaling substantial underlying strength. The optimistic outlook for this stock is further enhanced by a positive crossover observed in the 14-week RSI and the MACD, collectively reinforcing the bullish sentiment. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 238, Rs 240 Stop-Loss: Rs 208 Anshul Jain, Head of Research at Lakshmishree Investments Lumax Auto Technologies | CMP: Rs 1,298.5 Lumax Auto Technologies has broken out of a bullish cup and handle pattern and is displaying strong relative strength compared to the broader indices. Notably, in a week when the index witnessed sharp declines, the stock defied the trend and broke out to fresh all-time highs. A sustained move above Rs 1,270 will add momentum and open the path towards Rs 1,550 levels initially. Both moving averages and momentum indicators are aligned in favour of the bulls, suggesting that the breakout is likely to sustain and attract further participation. The structure remains highly constructive for a continued upmove. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,550 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,240 Aditya Vision | CMP: Rs 572 Aditya Vision has broken out of a bullish 191-day cup and handle pattern on the daily charts. Post-breakout, the stock has formed a bullish flag over the past six sessions — a continuation pattern that strengthens the overall structure. A sustained breakout above Rs 580 will likely trigger follow-through buying and open the way towards Rs 700 levels in the near term. Daily moving averages and momentum indicators remain supportive, suggesting that the upmove has strong potential to sustain further. The technical setup remains firmly in favour of the bulls.

Smallcaps tumble up to 15% as broader indices lag,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/smallcaps-tumble-up-to-15-as-broader-indices-lag-13585260.html,"The broader indices broke a three-week gaining streak and underperformed the main indices as markets remained under pressure throughout the week on worries over fresh tariffs on pharma, higher visa fees by the US, persistent trade concerns, and continued FII selling. For the week, Nifty50 plunged 672.35 points or 2.65 percent to finish at 24,654.70, while the BSE Sensex index declined 2199.77 points or 2.66 percent to end at 80,426.46. BSE mid, large, and smallcap indices declined 3-4.5 percent. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) remained net sellers throughout the week, extending their selling for the 13th consecutive week, as they offloaded equities worth Rs 19,570.03 crore, while Domestic Institutional Investors (DII) continued their buying in 24nd week, as they purchased equities worth Rs 17,411.40 crore. For the month, FII sold equities worth Rs 30,141.68 crore, while DII bought equities worth Rs 55,736.09 crore. All the sectoral indices gave a negative return during the week, with the Nifty IT index plunging 8 percent, the Nifty Realty index shedding 6 percent, the Nifty Pharma index falling 5.2 percent, the Nifty Consumer Durables slipping 4.6 percent, Nifty Defence index declining 4.4 percent. ""This week, the overall market breadth of the Indian equity markets was negative as it factored in the US announcement with respect to H1B visas and the pharma sector. The BSE Sensex and the NSE Nifty index fell in excess of 2% and the decline in the BSE Midcap and the BSE Smallcap was higher at ~4%,"" said Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities. ""All the key sectoral indices ended the week in the red. The US announced stricter norms on H1B visas. Accenture’s FY26 revenue guidance assumes no improvement in discretionary spending at the top end and some deterioration at the bottom end. THE BSE IT index corrected by 7% this week. The BSE healthcare index corrected ~5% this week amid the US announcing 100% tariffs on branded or patented pharma products imported into the US."" ""Auto stocks remained in focus as news reports indicate healthy booking and deliveries in the initial days of the current festive season. Global equity markets were mixed in the past week, with developed markets outperforming the emerging markets. The key global news-flows impacting global markets included continued uncertainty around US trade policies and the ECB maintaining a cautious outlook on growth,"" he added. The BSE Small-cap index declined 4.2 percent with Apollo Pipes, SML Isuzu, MIC Electronics, Prudent Corporate Advisory Services, Sigachi Industries, Cigniti Technologies, SMS Pharmaceuticals, Eimco Elecon (India), Vishnu Prakash R Punglia, IOL Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals, Parsvnath Developers shed up to 15 percent. Zuari Industries, TVS Electronics, Indo Thai Securities, OM Infra, RACL Geartech,Allcargo Terminals, Automotive Stampings and Assemblies rising between 20-30 percent. Where is Nifty50 headed? Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Sustained weakness in heavyweights has accelerated the index’s decline over the past two sessions, with the Nifty now approaching its key support near the 200 DEMA around 24,400. Meanwhile, the sharp correction in mid- and small-cap stocks has further dampened market sentiment. Given this backdrop, we recommend adopting a cautious approach—focusing on fundamentally strong stocks while avoiding aggressive directional bets until clearer signals emerge. Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities A long bear candle was formed on the daily chart on Friday, which indicates a decisive breakdown of crucial supports of around 25000-24900 levels. This is not a good sign and signals more weakness in the short term. A long bear candle has been formed in Nifty on the weekly chart after three weeks of rise, which indicates a possibility of faster downside retracement in the market. The underlying trend of Nifty is sharply negative and the market is now sliding down to the next important support of around 24400-24300 (previous swing lows and 200-day EMA) by next week. Immediate resistance is placed at 24850 levels. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The Nifty broke below the crucial support level of 25,000, which triggered a decline and led to the breach of other intermediate supports. The sentiment remains weak, with immediate and critical support placed in the 24,550–24,500 zone. A decisive breakdown below 24,500 could extend the correction towards 24,150, which corresponds to the 38.20% Fibonacci retracement of the rally from 21,743 to 25,669. On the other hand, if the index holds above 24,500, a sharp recovery can be expected. Amol Athawale, VP Technical Research, Kotak Securities Technically, on weekly charts, Nifty has formed a long bearish candle. On intraday charts, it is holding a lower top formation, which supports further weakness from the current levels. We believe that the short-term market trend is weak, but due to temporary oversold conditions, we could see a pullback rally from the current levels. For traders, 24,800/81200 would act as a key level to watch. Below this, the correction wave is likely to continue. On the downside, the market could retest the levels of 24,500/80300. Further declines may also occur, potentially dragging the index down to 24,350/79800, 24300/79600. Conversely, above 24,800/81200, a pullback formation could continue up to 25,000-25,100/81800-82200. For Bank Nifty, the 20-day SMA or 54,750 would be a crucial zone. Below this, the chances of hitting 54,000-53,800 increase. However, if it sustains above the 20-day SMA or 54,750, it could bounce back to the 50-day SMA or 55,300-55,500. Short-term traders should remain cautious and be very selective, as there is a risk of getting trapped at lower levels.

"Wall Street ends streak of weekly gains, yields rise as investors digest data",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/wall-street-ends-streak-of-weekly-gains-yields-rise-as-investors-digest-data-13585236.html,"Gains in Wall Street indexes on Friday were not enough to erase a loss for the week while resilient consumer spending supported longer-dated Treasury yields and gold rose as a steady inflation reading supported bets on future Federal Reserve rate cuts. Consumer spending climbed slightly more than expected in August while the inflation rate rose to 2.7% from 2.6% in July, data showed, in line with economists' expectations. Analysts said some companies had fended off price pressures by stockpiling in anticipation of tariffs, but some volatility was to be expected ahead of corporate earnings releases in the coming weeks. ""Corporates have been able to withstand (a) tariff hit because they've had inventory build. But the earnings season will become the bigger test because many companies have told us they will start some price increases around the end of the year,"" said Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at Charles Schwab. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.65%, the S&P 500 rose 0.59% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.44%. Individual stocks responded to fresh White House tariffs on goods including pharmaceuticals and trucks. Paccar, which makes most of its trucks for the U.S. market domestically, gained 5%, and drugmaker Eli Lilly rose 1.5%. Richmond Fed Bank President Thomas Barkin told Bloomberg Television he had very low confidence in inflation forecasts, as tariffs continue to impact the economy.The prospect of a potential government shutdown is also adding uncertainty and could disrupt the data releases that investors follow closely for guidance. NOT FALLING OFF A CLIFF Friday's personal consumption expenditures index functions as a key component of the Federal Reserve's inflation outlook. U.S. Treasury yields, which influence borrowing costs, moved little after the data was released. The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes rose 0.7 basis points to 4.181%, from 4.174% late on Thursday. The 30-year bond yield rose 0.5 basis points to 4.7576% from 4.753% late on Thursday. ""The one bright spot was that income and spending were a little bit firmer than expected, which means the consumer isn't falling off a cliff as the market was expecting,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, head of U.S. rates strategy at TD Securities. Gold, a safe haven which usually benefits from lower interest rates, broadly held on to recent gains. Spot prices were last quoted 0.46% higher at $3,766.25 an ounce.Investors now estimate an 89.8% probability of a rate cut in October and a 67% chance of another in December, the CME FedWatch Tool shows. The Fed made its first interest rate cut of the year last week, and signalled further easing was to come. Fed Chair Jerome Powell offered little more direction at a speech on Tuesday, saying the central bank needed to continue balancing, opens new tab the risk of high inflation against a weakening job market. Oil prices rose as Ukrainian drone attacks on Russia infrastructure cut the major energy producer's exports. Brent futures settled at $70.13 a barrel, up 71 cents, or 1.02%. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude finished at $65.72 a barrel, gaining 74 cents, or 1.14%."
Trump’s dual shocks thwart bets on Indian stock market rebound,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/trump-s-dual-shocks-thwart-bets-on-indian-stock-market-rebound-13585213.html,"Call it a case of bad timing for Indian stock bulls. Donald Trump has dealt two fresh blows to investor sentiment just as the market was showing signs of a turnaround. The MSCI India Index has fallen in all five sessions since the US President signed an order to overhaul the H-1B visa program — a move that risks disrupting India’s $280 billion software services industry. His plan to impose a 100% duty on branded or patented pharmaceuticals saw Indian drugmakers join an Asia-wide selloff on Friday. Prior to these shocks, the MSCI India gauge had risen for three straight weeks, adding more than 4% in what was its longest run since May. Trump’s latest salvos have also shaken foreign investors, who seemed to be finally putting in their stride the punishing 50% US tariffs on India that have soured relations between the two nations. Global funds turned sellers of Indian shares in recent sessions following two weeks of purchases. “Escalating US–India tensions add another layer of pressure,” said Jian Shi Cortesi, a fund manager at GAM Investment Management in Zurich. “The related headlines provide investors with an additional nudge to reallocate away from India toward markets displaying stronger momentum, such as China and South Korea.” Constrained by a slowdown in economic growth as well as the pace of corporate earnings expansion, Indian stocks have struggled to keep their momentum in 2025 after rallying for six straight years. The MSCI India gauge has risen around 2% this year, trailing a broader gauge of Asian equities by over 19 percentage points after outperforming it over 2021-2024. Expectations Reset Investors were pinning hopes on a year-end rally in stocks, buoyed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s move earlier to lower nationwide consumption tax — which took effect on Sept. 22, the central bank’s continued focus on growth, and bets that the resumption of trade negotiations with the US will lead to a positive outcome. Those expectations are being reviewed following Trump’s latest actions. The MSCI India gauge’s about 3% decline this week was its biggest since February. A measure of IT stocks lost 7.9% over five sessions, the most since April. The tech sector commands a near-10% weighting on the MSCI gauge — the third-highest. Indians have made up more than 70% of the H-1B visas in the past. Economists have warned that the visa changes risk cutting remittance inflows, and could weaken the local currency, already among Asia’s worst performers. The rupee slid to a record low on Tuesday amid worries that India’s services exports could suffer alongside its tariff-hit merchandise exports. An index of drugmakers lost over 2% on Friday to register its worst daily performance since early August following Trump’s latest tariff salvo. “The underperformance of Indian asset prices looks set to continue,” Gavekal Research’s analysts Udith Sikand and Tom Miller wrote in a note. “The longer the 50% tariffs remain in place, the more likely it is that India’s economic growth disappoints.” Foreign funds have sold Indian stocks worth around $16 billion on a net basis in 2025. That’s on track to be the second-biggest ever outflow following a record $17 billion withdrawal in 2022. The market’s performance would have been much worse this year, if not for the strong equity purchases by local institutions. ‘Quiet Corner’ Some market watchers, such as strategists at HSBC Holdings Plc, are more optimistic. A team led by Herald van der Linde this week upgraded their stance on Indian stocks to overweight from neutral. “In stark contrast to the crowded trades in Korea and Taiwan, India is Asia’s quiet corner,” they wrote. “While earnings growth expectations can fall a little further, valuations are no longer a concern, government policy is becoming a positive factor for equities, and most foreign funds are lightly positioned.” The MSCI India gauge is trading at 21.8 times its 12-month forward earnings, down from a multiple of 24.5 a year ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Overall, investors agree that the near-term outlook for Indian equities, particularly in terms of foreign flows, will continue to be determined by geopolitics. Allspring Global Investments is among those adding exposure to domestically driven sectors such as consumer and financials, which are less vulnerable to Trump’s America First agenda. Hedging costs for Indian equities also climbed this week for the first time in a month. A gauge of 30-day ahead volatility on the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. closed above its 50-day moving average Friday, suggesting traders are bracing for heightened market volatility. Gary Dugan, chief executive officer of the Global CIO Office, said he would shift portfolios toward China and potentially to Latin America if geopolitical tensions with the US spiral."
Sun Pharma may face tariff turbulence in US but HSBC sees limited earnings risk,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/sun-pharma-may-face-tariff-turbulence-in-us-but-hsbc-sees-limited-earnings-risk-13585078.html,"Sun Pharma, India’s largest drugmaker, finds itself in the spotlight following US President Donald Trump’s announcement of a 100% import tariff on branded or patented pharmaceutical products, effective October 1, 2025. While the move is expected to shake up global pharma supply chains, HSBC believes the earnings impact on Sun Pharma may be limited. “Among Indian companies, only Sun Pharma has sizeable sales from patented products in the U.S.,” noted Damayanti Kerai, Analyst, India Healthcare at HSBC. “It reported global sales of $1.2 billion from patented products in FY25, of which the US market accounted for approximately $1.1 billion amounting to 17% of total revenue and 8–10% of consolidated EPS.” Sun Pharma’s patented portfolio, led by its blockbuster psoriasis drug Ilumya, is largely manufactured by global CDMO partners outside US. The drug substance for Ilumya is produced in South Korea, while the finished dose is made in Europe. This fragmented supply chain could complicate tariff compliance. “While this tariff development is broadly negative for Sun Pharma, we think the impact on earnings depends on multiple moving parts—spread of supply chain, IP location of the brand, and use of third-party manufacturers,” Kerai explained. HSBC outlines several mitigation strategies for Sun Pharma, including shifting manufacturing to CDMO partners with US-based plants, leveraging its own three manufacturing facilities in the US, or even acquiring a new plant. With over $3 billion in cash reserves as of June 2025, Sun Pharma has the financial muscle to act. However, HSBC cautions that “moving supply chains, tech-transfer, and plant re-purposing would take considerable time—anywhere from 6 to 24 months.” In its base case, HSBC estimates an 8–10% downside risk to Sun Pharma’s FY26–27 earnings if mitigation measures are delayed or ineffective. Yet, the brokerage remains optimistic. “We maintain our Buy rating and INR 1,850 target price, with no estimate changes,” Kerai affirmed.As the industry awaits Sun Pharma’s official response, the company’s ability to navigate this geopolitical curveball will be closely watched—not just by investors, but by the broader Indian pharma sector. An email sent to Sun Pharma seeking comment on possible impact of the Trump's tariff announcement is yet to elicit response at the time of publishing the story."
Trump’s 100% drug tariff: A mixed bag for India’s CRDMO industry,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/trump-s-100-drug-tariff-a-mixed-bag-for-india-s-crdmo-industry-13585063.html,"US President Donald Trump’s decision to impose a 100 percent import tariff on branded and patented pharmaceutical products from October 1, 2025, may be a mixed bag for India’s Contract Research, Development, and Manufacturing Organisation (CRDMO) sector.India’s pharmaceutical exports to the U.S. stood at $8.73 billion in 2024, accounting for 31 percent of total pharma exports. However, the bulk of these exports are generic drugs, which remain exempt from the new tariff. This offers a temporary cushion to Indian drugmakers, but the long-term impact on the CRDMO sector could be more complex. “Few Indian pharma companies with exposure to non-U.S. domiciled branded formulation or innovator drug companies, who in turn export to the U.S., may face challenges,” said Deepak Jotwani, VP & Sector Head, ICRA. The BCG-IPSO whitepaper “Unleashing the Tiger” highlights India’s growing CRDMO sector, currently valued at $3–3.5 billion, with ambitions to scale to $22–25 billion by 2035. The sector is riding high on global supply chain realignment, pricing pressures, and rising demand for new modalities like biologics and cell therapies. However, Trump’s tariff announcement introduces a new layer of uncertainty. While generics are spared, ambiguity remains around complex generics, specialty medicines, and biologics, segments where Indian CRDMOs are increasingly active. If these are eventually included under the tariff umbrella, Indian firms engaged in R&D and manufacturing for U.S.-bound branded drugs could face headwinds. India’s CRDMOs often serve as contract developers and manufacturers for global pharma giants. If these clients are hit by tariffs, the ripple effect could squeeze margins for Indian CDMOs, especially those involved in high-volume, low-margin production. The Trump administration’s Section 232 investigation into pharma imports, covering APIs, intermediates, and finished drugs, adds further uncertainty, with a final decision expected by March 2026. Despite the risks, the tariff could also accelerate the shift toward cost-effective alternatives, benefiting India’s generics and CRDMO segments in the short term. The BCG-IPSO report notes that India’s CRDMOs enjoy a 70–80% workforce cost advantage and 85% lower infrastructure setup costs compared to the West. With faster project startup times and improved IP regimes, India remains a preferred outsourcing destination. Moreover, companies with US manufacturing facilities under construction are exempt from the tariff, offering a strategic path to mitigate exposure. Several Indian CRDMOs are already expanding footprints in the US, UK, and Europe, positioning themselves as global partners. Syngene International, Cohance are two CRDMOs that have recently acquired facilities in the US. Piramal Pharma, which has facilities both in US and India, offers more flexibility to its customers. But analysts say that the Indian CRDMO industry has to invest on talent, accelerate innovation in biologics and new modalities, diversify markets beyond the US and strengthen local supplier ecosystems to reduce dependency on China and the West."

The tone was weak from the outset and worsened as the day progressed. Eventually, the Nifty closed near the day’s low at 24,654.70, down 0.95%. The decline was broad-based, with pharma and IT stocks leading the fall following U.S. tariff announcements on branded drugs. The broader indices bore the brunt of the sell-off, slipping nearly 2% each. The announcement of tariffs on branded drugs weighed heavily on sentiment, adding to recent concerns over visa policy changes. IT counters were further dragged by weak guidance from global peers, while persistent FII outflows and a weak rupee amplified the pressure. On the technical front, sustained weakness in heavyweights has accelerated the index’s decline over the past two sessions, with the Nifty now approaching its key support near the 200 DEMA around 24,400. Meanwhile, the sharp correction in mid- and small-cap stocks has further dampened market sentiment. Given this backdrop, we recommend adopting a cautious approach—focusing on fundamentally strong stocks while avoiding aggressive directional bets until clearer signals emerge. Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments The Indian market experienced a bloodbath, mirroring the rout across Asian markets. Investor sentiment was rattled by a fresh wave of tariffs targeting the pharmaceuticals, dragging pharma stocks deep into the red. Meanwhile, Accenture’s weaker guidance and job cuts highlighted slowing IT spending, with AI-driven growth failing to meet expectations, prompting a broad sell-off in tech shares.
