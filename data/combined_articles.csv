"Avanti Feeds, Welspun Living, other shrimp & textile stocks drop up to 4% after sharp gains on India-US trade talks hopes",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/avanti-feeds-welspun-living-other-shrimp-textile-stocks-drop-up-to-4-after-sharp-gains-on-india-us-trade-talks-hopes-13538631.html,"The shares of several export-oriented shrimp feed and textile companies dropped in trade on September 11 (Thursday). This comes as investors may have resorted to profit booking, a day after the stocks recorded massive gains. The stocks had seen significant surge on September 10 (Wednesday) after US President Donald Trump said Washington and New Delhi will resume negotiations to resolve the ongoing trade frictions. Apex Frozen Foods shares dropped over 4 percent to trade at Rs 246.28 apiece in the morning, while those of Avanti Feeds plunged 4 percent to trade at Rs 728.60 apiece. The two stocks had rallied 17 percent and 15 percent respectively yesterday. Among the textile stocks, Welspun Living shares dropped over 2 percent to trade at Rs 122.50 apiece. Raymond Lifestyle shares meanwhile fell nearly 2 percent to trade at Rs 1,286 apiece. The stocks had jumped 10 percent and 2 percent respectively the previous day. In a social media post on Truth Social, Trump announced, ""I am pleased to announce that India, and the United States of America, are continuing negotiations to address the Trade Barriers between our two Nations."" ""I look forward to speaking with my very good friend, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in the upcoming weeks. I feel certain that there will be no difficulty in coming to a successful conclusion for both of our Great Countries!"" he further wrote. The shares of these export-oriented companies had significantly declined earlier after the Trump administration increased tariffs on Indian imports to a whopping 50 percent, citing New Delhi's continued purchase of Russian oil. However, Trump's latest comment may have boosted investor sentiment on the possibility of the two countries concluding their long-awaited tariff deal. Additionally, the US Supreme Court has agreed to decide the legality of Donald Trump's sweeping global tariffs. This comes after a lower court ruled that Trump’s tariffs were illegal.

Nomura sees 30 percent upside for Gail India on one-time boost from tariff hike and petchem recovery,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/nomura-sees-30-percent-upside-for-gail-india-on-one-time-boost-from-tariff-hike-and-petchem-recovery-13538349.html,"Shares of Gail India are higher by over 2.5 percent to be the top F&O gainer in the trading session on September 11, after brokerage Nomura issued a Buy call with a target of Rs 225 per share, which is nearly 30 percent higher than the last closing price, projecting that the company will get a one-time benefit from the proposed tariff hikes. Nomura said a tariff hike could provide a one-time boost to Gail India, with an integrated tariff increase of over 20 percent could potentially surprise investors on the upside. The note also said that Gail's petchem segment is expected to start seeing a recovery from FY27e onwards, contributing to the high investor interest in the stock. Gail India has already seen volumes of 55 lakh shares, at more than half of its one-month and one-week average. On a YTD basis, shares of Gail India are lower by 6.7 percent, and over the last one year, the shares are down 18 percent. However, over the last three years, Gail India shares are higher by 93 percent. The month of September has traditionally been positive for the stock, with the company delivering positive returns in 13 out of last 17 years during the month. The company has submitted a request to Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) for a 33 percent increase in gas tariff to Rs 78/mmbtu, citing rising cost of substitute gas used by compressors in pipeline operations, since gas allocation under Administered Price Mechanism (APM) has been cut to zero. Also, the capacity determination by PNGRB for GAIL’s integrated pipeline has come out to be lower than previously expected. Gail's revenue from operations from natural gas transmission in FY25 rose by 7 percent on year to Rs 11,068 crore due to increase in transmission volume and upward revision in tariffs. The company has a near 65 percent share in India's natural gas transmission. Nomura said it expects tariffs to be revised to around Rs 70/mmbtu with effect from April 2026, which is an increase of 19.5 percent. According to the note, this should translate into a 42 percent on year rise in gas transmission EBIT during FY27e, and the consolidated group EBIT is expected to rise by 24 percent. Gail is India's largest state-run natural gas processing and distribution company, with interests in domestic and overseas oil and gas assets, renewable energy and City Gas Distribution as well as Compressed Biogas. The regulator is in the process of finalising the integrated tariff of Gail India, which is an integral part of the 'Unified Tariff'.

After gaining up to 5.5 percent in the past two sessions on hopes of a US Federal Reserve rate cut, the Nifty IT index slipped nearly 1 percent, making it one of the top sectoral losers. Nine out of 10 constituents traded in the red. Persistent Systems led the fall, declining up to 2 percent to Rs 5,326 apiece on the NSE. Infosys dropped 1.38 percent as investors tracked for updates from the board of IT major which convenes today to consider a proposal for share buyback, which will be the first one in three years, and fifth in last eight years. Decision on Infosys buyback closely watched as board considers first proposal in three years LTIMindtree shed 1.66 percent. Wipro, HCL Technologies, Tech Mahindra and Mphasis also traded lower, slipping up to 1.3 percent. Tata Consultancy Services was the sole gainer, edging up 0.14 percent. The recent rally in IT shares was fuelled by expectations of a Fed rate cut and easing trade concerns after US President Donald Trump said Washington and New Delhi would resume talks to resolve trade differences. Indian IT firms derive a significant share of their revenue from the US market. However, sentiment turned cautious as investors awaited US consumer price index (CPI) data, due later in the day, following weaker-than-expected producer price numbers. A Reuters poll projected CPI to rise 0.3 percent month-on-month in August, after a 0.2 percent increase in July. On a year-on-year basis, CPI was seen at 2.9 percent versus 2.7 percent in July.

The stock was actually trading in the red with marginal losses at Rs 596 apiece. Patanjali Foods' board of directors during a meeting in July had approved the issue of bonus shares in the ratio of 2:1. The record date to determine the eligibility of the shareholders set to receive the bonus equity shares was set on September 11. A company announces bonus issue of shares to reward its existing shareholders with an investment opportunity, which is perceived to be attractive. While the issue of bonus shares increases the total number of shares issued and owned, it does not change the market capitalization of the company. This increases the overall liquidity of the stock, and makes it more affordable for other investors to add to their portfolio, creating strong upside potential for the stock. As a result, Patanjali Foods shares appeared to have crashed 67 percent in one session, while in reality, they simply adjusted to the bonus issue. After the issuance of bonus shares, the company's market capitalization stands at around Rs 64,856 crore and the stock's P/E ratio nears 18. The issuance of bonus shares will likely increase investors' confidence for the stock, as it reflects on the firm's strong financials and growth potential. Bonus issue essentially are free shares offered by a company from its reserves. Investors must own shares of the company as on the record date to be eligible for the bonus issue.

Decision on Infosys buyback closely watched as board considers first proposal in three years,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/decision-on-infosys-buyback-closely-watched-as-board-considers-first-proposal-in-three-years-13538243.html,"Investors will closely track for updates as the board of IT major Infosys convenes today to consider a proposal for share buyback, which will be the first one in three years, and fifth in last eight years. Shares of the company opened quiet on September 11 but slipped nearly a percent lower to be the top loser on Nifty 50. The shares have gained 2.6 percent in last one week and 6.6 percent over last one month, while on a YTD basis, shares of Infosys are lower by 19 percent. Market participants will be closely watching for the size of the buyback and how much of its cash reserves will the company deploy to purchases shares from investors. Also on radar will be the premium that the company will offer in order to buy back the shares. The timing of the buyback is also interesting, coming at a time for ongoing tariffs by US President Trump on Indian exports, and when the US economy has been facing risks of a slowdown, and amid calls of curb on US H1-B visas among Trump's supporters. In a recent note, Morgan Stanley has said that it sees a buyback of around Rs 10,000-14,000 crore by Infosys, coming in at around 18-25 percent premium to the current price. As of June 2025, Infosys was sitting on cash on books worth Rs 24,500 crore. Infosys has a high cash-generating business with access to global capital. The company's primary source of funds is cash from operations and income from short and long-term investments, among others. ""Our strong performance on the back of meticulous execution over the years, as reflected in the combination of high growth, strong cash generation and profitability, has led to building a strong, debt-free, and liquid Balance Sheet,"" the company had said in its annual report for FY25. The company has returned nearly Rs 88,400 crore, or 85% of the cumulative free cash flow between FY20-24 through dividends and buybacks, as part of its capital allocation policy. During the year ended March 31, 2025, Infosys paid an interim dividend of Rs 21 per share and announced a final dividend of Rs 22 per share. In the last five years preceding FY25, Infosys had purchased and extinguished a total of 11.62 crore fully paid-up equity shares from stock exchanges. The company has only one class of equity shares and even ADR holders are eligible for the buyback. Motilal Oswal has a Neutral call on Infosys with a target price of Rs 1750, and Prabhudas Lilladher has an Accumulate call with the same target. The IT space has not seen a buyback from the top-tier names in the last two years, and both Wipro and TCS are eligible to come out with their own, thus Infosys' board decision a closely watched by market participants. Both TCS and Wipro have conducted five buybacks each between 2016-2023, whereas Infosys has carried out four buybacks since 2017. The IT services major had revised its full-year revenue growth guidance for FY26 to 1-3 percent growth in constant currency (CC), increasing the lower end of the range.

Track the latest updates on GIFT Nifty right here on Moneycontrol. Indian benchmark indices extended the previous session gains with Nifty crossing 25,000 intraday on September 10, led by IT, financial, realty names. However, profit booking in auto and media stocks erased some of the intraday gains. At close, the Sensex was up 323.83 points or 0.40 percent at 81,425.15, and the Nifty was up 104.5 points or 0.42 percent at 24,973.10. BSE midcap and smallcap indices rose 0.7% each. For the week, BSE Sensex and Nifty added 1.2 percent each. Here is how financial markets across the globe fared overnight: GIFT Nifty (Up) The GIFT Nifty is trading marginally higher at around 25,089.50, indicating a muted start for the day. Asian Equities (Gain) Asian equities were mixed Thursday after a rally on Wall Street drove stocks and bonds higher, as a drop in producer prices supported bets the Federal Reserve will resume cutting interest rates next week. US Equities (Mixed) The S&P 500 and Nasdaq notched record-high closes on Wednesday, as Oracle surged and cooler-than-expected inflation data supported expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next week. Oracle soared 36% in its biggest one-day percentage gain since 1992 after the tech company pointed to a demand surge from AI firms for its cloud services. The S&P 500 climbed 0.30% to end the session at 6,532.04 points, closing with a record high for the second straight day. The Nasdaq gained 0.03% to 21,886.06 points for its third consecutive record-high close. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.48% to 45,490.92 points US Bond Yield (Mixed) The yield on 10-year Treasuries were up marginally while 2-year Treasuries were down marginally in the early trade on Thursday. Dollar Index (Flat) The dollar stabilised in early Asian trading hours on Thursday after an unexpected drop in U.S. factory-gate prices bolstered expectations the Federal Reserve will cut rates next week and traders awaited U.S. consumer price data due later in the day. Asian currencies (Gain) Asian currencies were trading lower in the early Thursday trade with Taiwan Dollar leading the gainers. However, year-to-date basis, except Indonesian Rupiah, all other currencies were trading higher. Crude (Flat) Oil steadied after a three-day gain as investors weighed Donald Trump’s latest comments regardingRussia and whether the US president will follow through with measures to punish Moscow for the Ukraine war. Gold (Up) Gold steadied just below a record after a surprise drop in US producer prices supported the case for the Federal Reserve to ease policy. Fund Flow Action The Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) sold equities worth Rs 115 crore on September 10, while Domestic institutional investors (DIIs) purchased equities worth Rs 5004 crore on the same day.

Asian shares steady as US stocks climb into CPI,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/asian-shares-steady-as-us-stocks-climb-into-cpi-13537347.html,"Asian equities were mixed Thursday after a rally on Wall Street drove stocks and bonds higher, as a drop in producer prices supported bets the Federal Reserve will resume cutting interest rates next week. Shares in Australia fell while those in Japan swung between gains and losses in early trading. US futures edged higher after the S&P 500 rose 0.3% to a new record Wednesday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 ended the session fractionally higher. Treasuries were steady after a rally across the curve Wednesday, while Australian and New Zealand government bonds rose Thursday. An index of the dollar was little changed while the yen strengthened against the greenback early Thursday. The Wednesday moves in the US reflected fresh optimism that the Fed will cut rates next week after producer prices unexpectedly declined for the first time in four months. The data soothed worries that elevated inflation would create a challenge for policymakers trying prevent a jobs downturn ahead of US inflation figures due later Thursday. “Investors are now contemplating the extent to which August’s payrolls, the benchmark revisions, and PPI should drive a conversation about a 50 basis-point cut next week,” said Ian Lyngen and Vail Hartman at BMO Capital Markets. “We are still in the 25 basis-point cut camp. For a half-point to be a real possibility, tomorrow’s core-CPI move will need to underwhelm.” Monthly US producer prices excluding food and energy declined 0.1% in August from the prior month, falling short of consensus estimates of a 0.3% increase, while July’s figure was also revised down. The data may indicate firms are trying to stay competitive to maintain market-share, said Neil Dutta at Renaissance Macro Research. “The Fed should cut 50 basis points next week — but I don’t think they will,” Dutta said. “The doves on the FOMC have a very strong case to make. The hawks will argue that the unemployment rate is still low, financial conditions are loose, and that there is still upward inflation pressure in front of us due to tariffs.” In Asia, data set for release Thursday includes inflation expectations in Australia and industrial production in Malaysia. Later Thursday, the European Central Bank is expected to keep interest rates unchanged. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is seeking to raise $3.17 billion in an offering of zero-coupon convertible notes that’s set to be the year’s biggest, according to terms of the deal seen by Bloomberg News. The company’s ADRs fell 2.2% in New York trading Wednesday. Elsewhere, US President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged to talk and resume trade negotiations, signaling a possible thaw after weeks of a blistering fight over tariffs and Russian oil purchases. US Inflation Core CPI, a measure of underlying inflation excluding food and fuel, probably rose 0.3% for a second month, according to the Bloomberg survey median estimate. A weaker-than-expected reading may prompt further speculation for a 50 basis point Fed cut next week. The combination of a moderation in jobs growth and still-manageable inflation should keep the Fed on track to cut rates, with a 25-basis-point cut expected in September to be followed by three additional consecutive cuts of the same size by January 2026, according to Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi at UBS Global Wealth Management. “Tomorrow’s CPI will carry more weight, but today’s PPI print essentially rolled out the red carpet for a Fed rate cut next week,” said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley. “After last week’s jobs report, though, the market was already expecting the Fed to begin an easing cycle, so it remains to be seen how much of a near-term impact this will have on sentiment.” In commodities, gold rose early Thursday after gains in the prior session and oil rose for a fourth day as investors weighed Trump’s next moves to pressure Russia, raising concerns over crude supplies. Meanwhile, Mexico is looking to apply tariffs of as much as 50% on cars, auto parts, steel and textiles from China and other countries with which it does not have a trade agreement, according to Economy Minister Marcelo Ebrard."

With price recovering towards the 21-day EMA, sustained trade above Rs 390 could open the way for further upside, while support is placed at Rs 378 on the lower side. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 410 Stop-Loss: Rs 378 Nilesh Jain, Head – Technical and Derivatives Research Analyst (Equity Research) at Centrum Broking Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders | CMP: Rs 2,755.3 Mazagon Dock formed a good base formation and also found strong support at the 200-DMA, placed at Rs 2,685 levels. Earlier, we saw a lot of underperformance and short build-up in this space, and now we have started witnessing short covering, which indicates a sentimental change in this space. On the technical front, we have seen a breakout from a falling trendline with higher-than-average volumes. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,000 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,590 Wipro | CMP: Rs 255.75 The Nifty IT index has formed a strong base and is rebounding from oversold levels. Wipro has given a breakout from an inverse Head and Shoulders pattern on the daily chart, backed by strong trading volumes. Momentum indicators and oscillators have confirmed a bullish crossover, and the RSI has also broken above a falling trendline, strengthening the positive view. Based on this setup, the stock is likely to move towards Rs 286 in the near term, with support placed at Rs 242, near the right shoulder of the pattern. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 286 Stop-Loss: Rs 242 VIP Industries | CMP: Rs 447.7 VIP Industries has broken out of a symmetrical triangle pattern on the daily chart, indicating a continuation of its upward trend. The breakout was accompanied by strong volumes, reflecting solid underlying strength. Based on the pattern, the target is estimated around Rs 495, with immediate support at Rs 425. Considering these technical signals, the stock is expected to sustain its positive momentum in the short term, and a buy-on-dips strategy is advised. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 495 Stop-Loss: Rs 425 Dhupesh Dhameja, Derivative Research Analyst at Samco Securities Mankind Pharma | CMP: Rs 2,608.5 Mankind Pharma has displayed notable strength over the last three consecutive sessions, moving higher while respecting the rising trendline support. The stock is consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern, and price action is now on the verge of a decisive breakout as it tests the upper trendline. Importantly, the consolidation phase has been accompanied by subdued volumes, suggesting accumulation at current levels rather than distribution. The stock is also sustaining above its 20-EMA and 50-EMA, which underpins a constructive bias. Momentum indicators are turning favourable, with the RSI climbing to 59 and forming higher lows—a sign of strengthening momentum and persistent buying at dips. The narrowing price action near the triangle apex further indicates that a strong directional move is imminent. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,875 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,460 Hindustan Aeronautics | CMP: Rs 4,557.5 Hindustan Aeronautics has shown a strong rebound from its key demand zone near Rs 4,250–4,300, where it formed a solid base over the past few weeks. In the latest session, the stock broke above its falling trendline resistance with a strong bullish candle, supported by a notable rise in volumes, confirming fresh buying interest. The stock is also trading back above its 20-EMA and 200-EMA, signaling a positive shift in trend after a prolonged consolidation. The RSI has surged to 56, making a sharp higher low, which reflects improving momentum and strengthening bullish sentiment. The breakout from the consolidation zone after multiple retests indicates that supply absorption has likely occurred, setting the stage for a sustained up-move. The price action suggests the possibility of further gains in the near term, as improving momentum and volume-backed breakout reinforce a bullish outlook in the short to medium term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 4,950 Stop-Loss: Rs 4,350 Indraprastha Gas | CMP: Rs 211.33 IGL has shown resilience around the key support zone of Rs 207–210, where it has respected the ascending trendline support and 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level. The stock has witnessed a healthy pullback from this support area, reflecting strong buying interest at lower levels. Currently, the stock is trading above its 20-EMA and 50-EMA while maintaining its higher-low structure, which indicates a sustained bullish undertone. The RSI is placed near 55, rebounding from the neutral zone, suggesting improving momentum and scope for further upside. The recent consolidation breakout and retest near support reinforce the view that supply has been absorbed, paving the way for a continuation of the uptrend. The stock can pick up momentum on a sustained move above Rs 212, which would further strengthen the bullish bias.

We are of the view that the 50-day SMA/24920/81200 and the 24,800/81000 level will act as key support zones for traders. As long as the market trades above these levels, the bullish sentiment is likely to continue. On the higher side, the index could move up to 25,100–25,200/81700-82000.

Its manufacturing and research and development facilities are located in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. The consolidated revenue of Divi’s increased 13.8% YoY to Rs. 2,410cr in Q1FY26 but exhibited a sequential decline of 7% primarily due to pricing pressures in the generic division. Though the company reported steady performance this quarter, led by growth in custom synthesis, the pricing pressure in the generics segment and higher logistics and shipping costs dragged down gross margins. EBITDA grew 17.2% YoY to Rs. 729cr and the margin increased 90bps. However, it sequentially declined 18% due to pricing pressures and logistics costs. The custom synthesis segment grew 23.1% YoY to Rs.1,277cr, supported by multiple projects across R&D, pilot, and validation stages. However, near-term challenges may arise from generic competition in Entresto. Outlook Divi’s also faces the risk of losing business related to sacubitril/valsartan (Entresto), adding to competitive pressures. The company is also trading at a premium valuation.

(Apex) is a South India (Andhra Pradesh) based exporter of processed shrimps with a capacity of 34,240MT. In Q1FY26, revenue increased 39% YoY to Rs.258cr, supported by 17% growth in volumes and a 19% improvement in realisations, partly aided by INR depreciation. Gross margin rose 140 bps YoY to 32.9% YoY, while EBITDA margin widened 30 bps YoY to 6.0%. However, profitability remains below pre-Covid levels of ~10– 11%, primarily due to softer realizations and elevated farm-gate costs. Recently, the US imposed a 50% tariff along with a 5.77% countervailing duty on Indian exports. This development poses a major headwind for India’s export sector, while trade negotiations between the two countries are still underway. Apex has been actively diversifying its market presence, helping mitigate risks from a high US dependency amid tariff challenges. The contribution of non-US markets to total sales has risen to ~45%, up from ~24% over the past seven years. Outlook Expect revenue/EBITDA to grow at 13%/85%, respectively, over FY25-27E. We value Apex at 17X P/E and recommend BUY rating with a revised target price of Rs. 284.

Vodafone Idea shares rise 3 percent after moving petition before SC against DoT's calculation of fresh AGR dues,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/vodafone-idea-shares-rise-3-percent-after-moving-petition-before-sc-against-dot-s-calculation-of-fresh-agr-dues-13535703.html,"Shares of telecom major Vodafone Idea jumped more than 3 percent on September 10, a day after it was reported that the company has filed a petition before the Supreme Court, challenging DoT's calculation of fresh AGR dues amounting to Rs 9,450 crore. The shares of the company hit an intraday high of Rs 7.51 per share but later pared gains to trade over a percent higher in mid-day trade. Vodafone Idea shares have now been higher in five out of six straight sessions, rising more than 15 percent in September so far. The stock has recovered nearly 23 percent after hitting a 52-week low of Rs 6.12 apiece in August this year, however it is still down around 45.5 percent from its 52-week high of Rs 13.77 per share hit a year ago. Vodafone Idea urged Supreme Court to quash an additional Rs 9,450 crore AGR demand by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), alleging that the fresh dues exceed the scope of the Court's earlier ruling on AGR liabilities. The telecom operator's petition challenged DoT's revised calculations which covered dues up to FY17 and the updated licence fee obligations for both the Idea Cellular group and Vodafone Idea Limited through FY19. These revised dues fall under the government's moratorium on AGR payments, which ends on March 31 next year, after which, Vodafone Idea will have to begin making instalments. As part of its latest assessment, the DoT has raised an extra demand of Rs 2,774 crore for FY18-19. Vodafone Idea claimed that certain amounts have been added twice and need reconciliation. The company has asked for a recalculation of dues, starting from the pre-FY17 period. According to the petition, out of the total Re 9,450 crore demand, Rs 2,774 crore pertains to the post-merger entity — Idea Group and Vodafone Idea — following their August 2018 consolidation, while Rs 5,675 crore relates to the pre-merger Vodafone Group's liabilities. The Supreme Court in March, 2020 locked Vodafone Idea's AGR dues till 2016-17 based on calculations by the department of telecommunications (DoT), adding that no self-assessment or re-assessment of the dues would be permitted. However, DoT had sought additional payments for up to 2018-19, Vodafone Idea said in its petition dated September 8. The telecom operator owes about Rs 83,400 crore in AGR dues to the government, with annual payments of Rs 18,000 crore beginning in March.

Further, its capacity share in the south region (in the industry) has increased to ~25% currently from ~12% in FY23. UTCEM management, in its 1QFY26 earnings concall, sounded optimistic about pricing and profitability in the south region. Despite significant capacity additions in the past two years, we believe the company will continue to expand its presence in the south. The company is on track to achieve its 200mtpa domestic grey cement capacity target well ahead of schedule and is anticipated to announce the next phase of expansion in the coming quarters.

"IT stocks rally for 2nd day: OFSS, Wipro, others rise up to 8% on hopes over US trade talks, Fed rate cut",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/it-stocks-rally-for-2nd-day-ofss-wipro-others-rise-up-to-8-on-hopes-over-us-trade-talks-fed-rate-cuts-13534826.html,"The shares of IT companies sharply gained on September 10, pushing the sectoral index up more than 2 percent in the morning. The Nifty IT index led gains among the major sectoral indices, extending strong gains for the second consecutive session after five-day losing streak. The IT index rose to 36,075.95 in the morning. Here are the possible triggers for today's sharp rise: Trump says India-US trade talks to resume: The sharp rise in the IT stocks today was fuelled after US President Donald Trump said Washington and New Delhi will resume negotiations to resolve the ongoing trade frictions. In a social media post on Truth Social, Trump announced, ""I am pleased to announce that India, and the United States of America, are continuing negotiations to address the Trade Barriers between our two Nations."" ""I look forward to speaking with my very good friend, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in the upcoming weeks. I feel certain that there will be no difficulty in coming to a successful conclusion for both of our Great Countries!"" he further wrote. While the tariffs were not implemented on IT services, the easing trade tensions between India and US will likely benefit the IT companies which derive major portion of their revenue from the American markets. Rising hopes for Fed rate cut: The US Federal Reserve is set to hold its FOMC meeting from September 16 to September 17. Analysts increasingly expect the American central bank to cut its rates this time, amid weakening jobs data and rising pressure from President Donald Trump's administration. The US economy likely created 911,000 fewer jobs in the 12 months through March than previously estimated, according to the latest data from Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics. This further hiked rate cut hopes. A rate cut in the US will likely increase the discretionary spending capacity, which will likely help the IT companies which derive a major portion of their revenue from the American market. The IT stocks had surged yesterday as well, led by Infosys. This came after the company announced that its board will meet on September 11 to consider a proposal for buyback of fully paid-up equity shares. If approved, this will be the first buyback of shares announced by India's second-largest IT firm since 2022, when the company had agreed to a buyback proposal of Rs 9,300 crore with a minimum buyback price of Rs 1,850 per share. Oracle Financial Services Software (OFSS) shares were the top gainer on the Nifty IT index, rising nearly 8 percent. This comes after its parent company and NYSE-listed Oracle Corp issued an ambitious outlook for its cloud business, sending its shares to a record high. The company also announced huge layoffs. Persistent Systems shares jumped nearly 5 percent, while Mphasis shares were up 4 percent. Coforge and LTI Mindtree shares gained more than 3 percent each, while Wipro, HCL Tech and Tech Mahindra shares rose over 2 percent each. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) shares gained nearly 2 percent, while Infosys shares were up more than 1 percent. What lies ahead? ""The dual tailwinds from GST rationalization and anticipation of a U.S. Fed rate reduction are acting as a long-needed support to Indian equities, insulating them from global tariff and demand uncertainties,"" said Siddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director, Vibhavangal Anukulakara Pvt. Ltd. ""Though the IT industry has taken a hit this year, these decisions are evidence of resilience and the industry's core position in India's growth narrative. To investors, it is a reminder that long-term value resides in remaining aligned to structural pillars, even in times of short-term churn,"" the analyst added. Bhavik Joshi, Business Head, INVasset PMS, however advised caution. ""Foreign investors remain cautious, discouraging a sustained rally. While local policy cues and GST relief offer seasonal optimism, the lack of a sharp earnings turnaround or acceleration in contract wins keeps sentiment muted. The buyback announcement from Infosys may provide a short-lived jolt, yet the broader narrative remains one of structural caution rather than exuberance,"" he said. ""In essence, what separates IT from other sectors today is the 'global tether'. The expectation of a U.S. rate cut may lift overall market sentiment, but until global tech spend and deal pipelines visibly recover, IT will lag broader indices. For now, this underperformance reflects prudence—not weakness—and positions IT for a selective comeback once global visibility returns,"" he added. Renewed optimism around capital allocation, coupled with easing rate-cut expectations globally, fueled broad-based gains across the sector, said Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking. ""However, participants shouldn't get carried away with a single day move and should wait for some signs of stability citing the prolonged underperformance,"" he added.

Shares of OFSS rise over 7 percent after parent Oracle's shares rallied on $0.5 trillion cloud outlook,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/shares-of-ofss-rise-over-7-percent-on-parent-oracle-s-stellar-rally-after-0-5-trillion-cloud-business-outlook-13534505.html,"Shares of Oracle Financial soared over 7 percent in early trade on September 10 after the parent company and NYSE-listed Oracle Corp issued an ambitious outlook for its cloud business, sending its shares to a record high. Oracle had said on September 9 that it expects booked revenue for the Cloud Infrastructure business to exceed half a trillion dollars on rising demand for low-cost cloud services. ""Over the next few months, we expect to sign-up several additional multi-billion-dollar customers and RPO is likely to exceed half-a-trillion dollars,"" said CEO Safra Catz. For the September quarter, Oracle sees total revenue to rise to 12-14 percent and sees cloud revenue growth between 32-36 percent. Given the strong demand for AI business tools, Oracle is likely positioning itself to capture the demand, according to some IT analysts. ""We made it very easy for our customers to directly connect all their databases ... to the world's most advanced AI reasoning models — ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, all of which are uniquely available in the Oracle Cloud,"" Oracle CEO Catz said during the earnings call. According to Bloomberg, Oracle Corp's 28 percent rise during post-market trading is the biggest gain for the shares since 1999. If Oracle Corp's market rally sustains during the trading session on September 10, the company would surpass JPMorgan Chase, Walmart, Eli Lilly and Visa in terms of market capitalisation. Riding on an increasing demand for its cloud solutions, OFSS said its license and cloud revenue grew 13 percent over the last fiscal year. ""...The cloud-based solutions help organisations focus on smaller initiatives that deliver tangible and incremental value. Organisations can incrementally optimise their operations, boost efficiency, and thereby significantly reducing the transformation risk,"" Managing Director and the CEO Makarand Padalkar said during the AGM earlier this month. On a YTD basis, shares of Oracle Financial Services are down 28 percent."
"Apex Frozen, Gokaldas Exports, other shrimp & textile stocks rally up to 14% after Trump says trade talks with India to resume",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/apex-frozen-gokaldas-exports-other-shrimp-and-textile-stocks-rally-up-to-14-after-trump-hints-at-trade-talks-with-india-13534426.html,"The shares of export-oriented shrimp feed and textile companies surged in the early trading hours of September 10. This comes after US President Donald Trump said Washington and New Delhi will resume negotiations to resolve the ongoing trade frictions. In a social media post on Truth Social, Trump announced, ""I am pleased to announce that India, and the United States of America, are continuing negotiations to address the Trade Barriers between our two Nations."" ""I look forward to speaking with my very good friend, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in the upcoming weeks. I feel certain that there will be no difficulty in coming to a successful conclusion for both of our Great Countries!"" he further wrote. The shares of these export-oriented companies had significantly declined earlier after the Trump administration increased tariffs on Indian imports to a whopping 50 percent, citing New Delhi's continued purchase of Russian oil. However, Trump's latest comment may have boosted investor sentiment on the possibility of the two countries concluding their long-awaited tariff deal. Additionally, the US Supreme Court has agreed to decide the legality of Donald Trump's sweeping global tariffs. This comes after a lower court ruled that Trump’s tariffs were illegal. Apex Frozen Foods shares rallied nearly 14 percent to trade at Rs 251 apiece. Avanti Feeds surged more than 9 percent, while Coastal Corporation shares jumped over 5 percent. Gokaldas Exports shares surged nearly 7 percent, while KPR Mill shares were up around 3 percent. Raymond Lifestyle gained nearly 2 percent, while Welspun Living shares surged more than 7 percent. Arvind shares were up over 4 percent. ""A major positive for the market today comes from President Trump’s initiative to improve India-U.S. relations and PM Modi’s positive response to the same. However, from past experience the market should judge President Trump by his actions and not words,"" said VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited.

Here is how financial markets across the globe fared overnight: GIFT Nifty (Up) The GIFT Nifty is trading marginally higher at around 24,992.50, indicating a flat to opening start for the day. Asian Equities (Gain) Asian stocks advanced Wednesday as technology shares powered gains and on hopes the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates to curb a jobs downturn. US Equities (Up) Wall Street's three main indexes scored record high closes on Tuesday, while UnitedHealth rallied, and a downward payrolls revision supported expectations the Federal Reserve will soon cut interest rates to shore up economic growth. The S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones Industrial Average each ended with fresh all-time highs, extending a rally this year fueled by excitement about artificial intelligence and expectations of lower borrowing costs. The S&P 500 climbed 0.27% to end the session at 6,512.61 points, surpassing its record last Thursday. The Nasdaq gained 0.37% to 21,879.49 points, its second consecutive record high close.

Asian stocks fluctuate as US jobs outlook cools,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/asian-stocks-fluctuate-as-us-jobs-outlook-cools-13533819.html,"Key Asian stock gauges fluctuated Wednesday after the S&P 500 hit a record on hopes the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates to curb a jobs downturn. Shares in South Korea rose in early trading, while those in Japan and Australia were mixed. US equity futures contracts edged higher after Big Tech lifted the index on Tuesday, even as most shares fell and Apple Inc. sank following its iPhone 17 launch. Treasuries edged higher early Wednesday. Oil extended gains after an Israeli attack in Qatar revived fears of an escalation of the Middle East conflict. After fresh signs of a cooling labor market, investors are bracing for inflation reports in the coming days that will help shape next week’s Fed meeting and the path of rate cuts into 2025 — a key test for whether Wall Street can sustain this month’s rally. Money markets are almost fully projecting three Fed cuts this year, with US producer and consumer price index data due this week. “The markets appear to believe will be enough to protect the US economy from a recession, judging by current risk appetite,” said Kyle Rodda, a market analyst at Capital.com in Melbourne. “A spicy inflation print would complicate this situation and force the Fed into potential nasty trade offs between the labor market and price stability.” In Asia, traders will monitor the potential for joint action by the US and the European Union to pressure Russia into Ukraine talks. President Donald Trump said he’s prepared to join the bloc to impose sweeping new tariffs on China and India — key buyers of Russian oil — and also said he plans to discuss trade with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi “in the coming weeks.” Investors are also awaiting China’s August print for factory-gate prices and consumer prices to gauge the economic impact of the government’s anti-involution campaign and the ongoing deflationary pressure. The yen was little changed early Wednesday after gaining Tuesday, following a report that Bank of Japan officials may raise interest rates again this year, regardless of domestic political instability. Fed Meeting Back in the US, the most relevant question now becomes the extent to which the August inflation data will reshape the market’s expectations for the Fed’s decision next week, according to Ian Lyngen and Vail Hartman at BMO Capital Markets. “The Fed is cutting 25 basis points — barring a far more dramatic downshift in the trajectory of realized inflation, in which case a half-point cut could be on the table,” they said. “We’re solidly in the quarter-point camp and view the August inflation update as more meaningful for the conversations about where the Fed cutting cycle ends, not how it begins.” In the run-up to the inflation reports, government data showed US job growth was far less robust in the year through March than previously reported. The number of workers on payrolls will likely be revised down by a record 911,000, or 0.6%, according to the preliminary benchmark revision out Tuesday. The final figures are due early next year. Jamie Dimon said the record revision to US payrolls data is further proof that the US economy is battling a slowdown. “The economy is weakening,” the JPMorgan Chase & Co. chief executive officer said in an interview with CNBC Tuesday. “Whether that is on the way to recession or just weakening, I don’t know.”"
"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Kansai Nerolac Paints, KEC International, Azad Engineering, RITES, Mphasis, SBI Card, and others on September 10?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-kansai-nerolac-paints-kec-international-azad-engineering-rites-mphasis-sbi-card-and-others-on-september-10-13533782.html,"The benchmark indices gained 0.39 percent on September 9, continuing their upward journey for the fifth consecutive session, but the market breadth was slightly negative. About 1,424 shares declined, against 1,350 rising shares on the NSE. The market is expected to consolidate before entering a fresh leg of upmove. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors Kansai Nerolac Paints | CMP: Rs 248.67 In the previous session, Kansai Nerolac Paints gave a breakout of the downward sloping channel. Also, since August 25, prices have protected the prior day’s low on a closing basis, suggesting strength in the ongoing trend. Additionally, prices have broken above the upper Bollinger Bands, suggesting a continuation of positive momentum in the coming sessions. Along with this, the KST (Know Sure Thing) indicator has already turned above the signal line and is now about to cross the zero line, suggesting that further good momentum is likely to build up. The stock is now trading at an important resistance area near Rs 252; a decisive breakout above this level is required for bullish momentum to continue. A break above Rs 252 could push prices higher towards Rs 264, followed by Rs 275. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 264, Rs 275 Stop-Loss: Rs 240 KEC International | CMP: Rs 879.15 At the start of September, KEC International found support on the upward sloping trendline, and we saw a sharp reversal of nearly 10% to the upside. The stock has been consistently outperforming its peers over the past week. In the previous session, prices finally closed above the prior day’s high after four days of consolidation, which is a positive sign. On the daily chart, the 15-day EMA has just crossed the 30 EMA, which is considered a bullish crossover, indicating that the short-term bias has turned positive. With follow-up buying, a move toward the previous important resistance near Rs 950 is expected. For now, a break above Rs 890 could start a fresh upside move toward Rs 950. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 950 Stop-Loss: Rs 850 JSW Infrastructure | CMP: Rs 313 In the previous session, JSW Infrastructure was up nearly 4%, supported by a surge in volumes, the highest since July 2025. On the daily chart, not a single candle has closed below the prior day’s low for the past two trading sessions, which is a positive sign. The stock is trading in a rectangular range of Rs 294–315 since July 2025, indicating accumulation. If prices manage to break above Rs 315, it could result in a bullish breakout from the pattern. Additionally, the MACD has just shown a bullish crossover, and follow-up buying is now required to confirm the same. A break Rs 315 could lead to a trending move toward Rs 332, followed by Rs 350. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 332, Rs 350 Stop-Loss: Rs 298 Nandish Shah, Senior Technical and Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities NLC India | CMP: Rs 239 The short-term trend of NLC India remains positive as it is placed above its 5-, 11-, and 20-day EMAs. The primary trend turned positive as the stock price closed above its 200-day EMA. Accumulation has been seen in the stock over the past few months as volumes on up days have been higher than on down days. Momentum indicators and oscillators are showing strength in the current uptrend. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 251, Rs 260 Stop-Loss: Rs 228 Azad Engineering | CMP: Rs 1,650 Azad Engineering’s price has broken out on the daily chart from a downward sloping trendline connecting the highs of June 2 and September 4. The stock has been forming a bullish higher top–higher bottom pattern on the daily charts. Momentum indicators and oscillators, like RSI and MFI, are in rising mode and are placed above 60, suggesting strength in the current bullish trend. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,740, Rs 1,800 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,570 RITES | CMP: Rs 270 The primary trend turned positive as RITES closed above its 200-day EMA. The stock has broken out on the daily chart from a downward sloping trendline connecting the highs of June 5 and July 2. The price rise is accompanied by a rise in volumes, suggesting strength in the uptrend. Momentum indicators and oscillators, like RSI and MFI, are in rising mode and placed above 60 on the daily chart. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 286, Rs 295 Stop-Loss: Rs 256 Amol Athawale, VP Technical Research at Kotak Securities Mphasis | CMP: Rs 2,853.3 After a sharp uptrend rally, Mphasis witnessed a bit of selling pressure, but eventually, the downward momentum paused, and the stock has found support. On the weekly charts, the stock has formed a cup-and-handle type formation, and a fresh breakout from the resistance zone is very likely in the coming trading sessions. As long as the stock is trading above Rs 2,760, the bullish texture is likely to continue. Above this level, the stock could move up to Rs 3,050. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,050 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,760 SBI Cards and Payment Services | CMP: Rs 819.35 On the daily scale, after a correction from higher levels, SBI Card was trading in a range-bound mode. However, it has now given a range breakout along with good volumes. Additionally, the RSI is indicating further uptrend from current levels, which could boost bullish sentiment. Therefore, the closing above the resistance line indicates that further bullish momentum is likely to continue in the near term. For positional traders, Rs 790 would be the decisive level. Trading above this level, the uptrend formation will likely continue up to Rs 880. However, if it closes below Rs 790, traders may prefer to exit long positions. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 880 Stop-Loss: Rs 790 Reliance Industries | CMP: Rs 1,376.2 Reliance Industries is in an accumulation zone, trading in a range-bound manner on the daily scale. However, recent bullish activity near the breakout zone of the range is indicating good strength. The stock is expected to break out and witness a fresh upmove from current levels, with a favourable risk–reward perspective. Over the next few trading sessions, Rs 1,340 could be the trend-decider level for bulls. If it sustains above Rs 1,340, we can expect a further uptrend toward Rs 1,470. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,470 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,340 Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Markets extend gains on IT surge; Infosys share buyback buzz lifts sentiment,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/markets-extend-gains-on-it-surge-infosys-share-buyback-buzz-lifts-sentiment-13532988.html,"India’s benchmark indices closed higher for the fifth straight session on September 9, led by a rebound in software exporters after Infosys announced it would consider a share buyback. The rally tracked firm global markets, with investors betting on the likelihood of a U.S. Federal Reserve rate cut at its upcoming policy meeting. At close, the Sensex rose 314 points, or 0.39 percent, to 81,101, while the Nifty 50 gained 95.45 points, or 0.39 percent, to settle at 24,868.60. The rupee also strengthened against the U.S. dollar, recovering from record lows touched last week. “Domestic equities edged higher on positive global cues, with IT stocks rallying on Infosys’s buyback announcement despite prevailing headwinds. Auto stocks, however, saw profit-booking after recent gains on GST rationalisation. While sentiment remains range-bound amid global uncertainties, prospects of a Fed rate cut and supportive domestic macros may sustain optimism in the near term,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services. Infosys was the top contributor to the Nifty’s gains, surging 5 percent—its steepest rise since May 12. Tech Mahindra, HCL Tech and TCS advanced between 1 percent and 2 percent, lifting the Nifty IT index 2.7 percent. Pharma and FMCG added 1 percent and 0.6 percent, respectively, while Realty and Oil & Gas slipped 0.2 percent each.

However, the index faces a crucial resistance near the 25,000 mark. A decisive breakout above this zone is required to confirm a fresh upward leg, while immediate support lies at the 21-DMA of 24,720,” said Nilesh Jain, Head – Technical and Derivatives Research, Centrum Broking. Investor focus now shifts to key U.S. inflation prints, with producer price data due Wednesday and consumer price data on Thursday."

Click to View More Outlook for September 10 Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities After showing weakness from the highs on Monday, Nifty continued with range bound action with positive bias on Tuesday and closed the day with modest gains of 95 points. After opening with an upside gap of 90 points, the market shifted into a narrow high low range movement that lasted for the whole session. The opening upside gap remains unfilled and Nifty closed at the highs. A small candle was formed on the daily chart with minor upper and lower shadow and with almost identical open and close. This market action indicates a formation of doji type candle pattern. But, having formed this pattern amidst a broader range bound action, the predictive value of this pattern could be less. The underlying trend of Nifty remains positive with choppy movement. Nifty is apparently creating base for decisive upside breakout of important resistance zone of around 24900-25000 levels (down sloping trend line and recent weekly highs). Immediate support is placed at 24750. Vaibhav Vidwani, Research Analyst at Bonanza Today, the Indian stock market closed on a positive note, with both the Nifty 50 and Sensex ending higher buoyed mainly by robust gains in the IT sector, alongside favourable global cues and renewed investor confidence in large cap names. The Nifty 50 settled at 24,868.6, rising 95 points (+0.39%), while the Sensex closed at 81,101.32, up 314 points (+0.39%). The positive close was propelled by strong buying in IT stocks, with the Nifty IT index rallying 2.8%. The rally gained traction after Infosys announced a proposed share buyback, which improved sentiment across the sector. Global equity optimism, on account of expectations for US Federal Reserve interest rate cuts and strong recent performances of US tech indices like Nasdaq, created a tailwind for domestic technology stocks. Additionally, a steady rupee and stable oil prices added to the upbeat market mood. Sectoral rotation saw midcaps remain subdued and profit-booking in autos after Monday’s sharp rally. Broad-based gains in IT, pharma, and FMCG stocks lifted the benchmarks, while realty, auto, and oil & gas sectors saw some selling. Market breadth was mixed, while large caps shone, midcap and smallcap participation was muted. Investors are closely watching upcoming inflation data from India and the US for clues on the Federal Reserve’s rate outlook, which will remain key for short term direction. The proposed second weekly derivatives expiry on Nifty supports current volumes and volatility. With a positive undertone and sectoral rotation fueling resilience in large caps, near term market trajectory is likely to hinge on global monetary signals and domestic macro numbers.

Buy Ujjivan Small Finance Bank; target of Rs 60: Emkay Global Financial,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-ujjivan-small-finance-bank-target-of-rs-60-emkay-global-financial-13531986.html,"Emkay Global Financial' research report on Ujjivan Small Finance Bank Ujjivan SFB hosted an analyst meet to present its long-term strategic plan encompassing ambitious growth over FY26-30E – 3x FY25 GLP at Rs1trn with 65-70% of the portfolio being secured and to still deliver sustained healthy RoA of 1.8-2%, mainly aided by better operational efficiency (C/A ratio less than 5% vs more than 6% now) and credit cost (~1-1.5% from over 2%). The mgmt claims that this strategic plan is Universal-bank-license-agnostic and expects to secure the license by Dec-25. However, we believe scaling up liability is a major challenge (targets 35% by FY30 vs 24% now) as an SFB, which should receive some boost by the ‘Universal Bank’ tag. Near term, the bank remains focused on managing asset quality, which it expects to gradually improve, and aims to be more visible from 2H. We trim our earnings estimate by 5-9%, building in some margin moderation/higher opex in the interim, though we expect Ujjivan to deliver 1.7-2% RoA over FY27-28E (from 1.3% in FY26E) led by MFI recovery. Outlook With the stock trading at 1.1x Sep-27E ABV—well below AU SFB’s 2.1x (which recently secured a Universal Bank license)—we believe it could re-rate as MFI recovery gathers steam, coupled with a Universal Bank license. We retain BUY and TP of Rs60 (rolling forward on 1.5x Sep-27E ABV).

"Nifty IT index rises 3%, snaps five-day losses; Infosys, Wipro lead gains: Here are three reasons",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/nifty-it-index-rises-2-snaps-five-day-losses-infosys-wipro-lead-gains-here-are-three-reasons-13531508.html,"The shares of IT companies surged on September 9, pushing the sectoral index sharply into the green. The Nifty IT index rose nearly 3 percent, snapping a five-day losing streak. The IT index ended the session at 35,255.90. It was the top sectoral gainer on the market today. Infosys shares led the gains, jumping nearly 5 percent to trade at Rs 1,502.40 apiece. Wipro shares followed, surging nearly 3 percent. Tech Mahindra, Persistent Systems and Mphasis shares gained more than 2 percent each, while Coforge, LTI Mindtree and HCL Technologies shares rose nearly 2 percent. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) shares were up more than 1 percent. Here are the possible triggers for the sharp rise: US Fed rate cut expectations: The US Federal Reserve is set to hold its FOMC meeting from September 16 to September 17. Analysts increasingly expect the American central bank to cut its rates this time, amid weakening jobs data and rising pressure from President Donald Trump's administration. Analysts now expect a 50-basis point rate cut at the September FOMC meeting. ""August labor market data has paved the way for a 'catch-up' 50 basis point rate cut at the September FOMC meeting, similar to what occurred at this time last year,"" said Standard Chartered in its latest note, doubling its earlier projection of a 25-bp reduction, following a soft August jobs report. A rate cut in the US will likely increase the discretionary spending capacity, which will likely help the IT companies which derive a major portion of their revenue from the American market. Infosys board to consider share buyback proposal: The shares of Infosys jumped more than 4 percent after the company announced that its board will meet on September 11 to consider a proposal for buyback of fully paid-up equity shares. If approved, this will be the first buyback of shares announced by India's second-largest IT firm since 2022, when the company had agreed to a buyback proposal of Rs 9,300 crore with a minimum buyback price of Rs 1,850 per share. Infosys made the announcement in the post market hours of September 8. The stock jumped more than 4 percent to trade at Rs 1,494 apiece on September 9, snapping a five-session losing streak. It is currently the top gainer on the Nifty IT index, as well as benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty. The sharp rise in heavyweight Infosys was the top contributor to the rise in the Nifty IT index. Value buying: The IT stocks have seen significant correction in recent days, amid tariff uncertainties and global worries. The Nifty IT index dropped nearly 4 percent in just five consecutive sessions. The sharp rise in the sector today may come as investors resort to value buying after significant correction. ""The IT stocks' rise today, especially with Infosys' buyback offer, highlights the speed at which sentiment can shift to positive when there are global and local triggers. The dual tailwinds from GST rationalization and anticipation of a U.S. Fed rate reduction are acting as a long-needed support to Indian equities, insulating them from global tariff and demand uncertainties,"" said Siddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director, Vibhavangal Anukulakara Pvt. Ltd. ""Though the IT industry has taken a hit this year, these decisions are evidence of resilience and the industry's core position in India's growth narrative. To investors, it is a reminder that long-term value resides in remaining aligned to structural pillars, even in times of short-term churn,"" the analyst added. Bhavik Joshi, Business Head, INVasset PMS, however advised caution. ""Foreign investors remain cautious, discouraging a sustained rally. While local policy cues and GST relief offer seasonal optimism, the lack of a sharp earnings turnaround or acceleration in contract wins keeps sentiment muted. The buyback announcement from Infosys may provide a short-lived jolt, yet the broader narrative remains one of structural caution rather than exuberance,"" he said. ""In essence, what separates IT from other sectors today is the 'global tether'. The expectation of a U.S. rate cut may lift overall market sentiment, but until global tech spend and deal pipelines visibly recover, IT will lag broader indices. For now, this underperformance reflects prudence—not weakness—and positions IT for a selective comeback once global visibility returns,"" he added. Renewed optimism around capital allocation, coupled with easing rate-cut expectations globally, fueled broad-based gains across the sector, said Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking. ""However, participants shouldn't get carried away with a single day move and should wait for some signs of stability citing the prolonged underperformance,"" he added.

""Effectively, by partnering, we've passed on the risk and de-risked ourselves. We've taken some money off the table. Crucially, we've retained the rights for emerging markets, including India. So, we've basically de-risked part of the asset by partnering with a big pharma and effectively monetising it,"" Glenn Saldanha said. Glenmark is India’s 11th largest pharma company by market capitalisation and 12th in terms of FY25 revenue."
