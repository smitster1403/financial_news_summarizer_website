"As 'fairly valued' JSW Cement leverages group’s steel output, Motilal Oswal initiates coverage",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/as-fairly-valued-jsw-cement-leverages-group-s-steel-output-motilal-oswal-initiates-coverage-13466222.html,"Shares of recently-listed JSW Cement are higher by over 3 percent on August 19, with brokerage Motilal Oswal initiating coverage with a 'Neutral' rating with a target price of Rs 163 per share, calling the stock 'fairly valued'. The note projects an FY26 profit of around Rs 300 crore for JSW Cement, with a revenue CAGR of 19 percent over FY25-28, and EBITDA CAGR of 31 percent for the same period. Unlike other cement players that have dominance in the grey cement category, JSW Cement has a higher concentration of revenue and profit from ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS), which is manufactured from slag, and is a byproduct of the steel-making process. Leveraging JSW Group’s presence in steel manufacturing, JSW Cement has emerged as the largest manufacturer of GGBS in India with a market share of close to 84 percent. Motilal Oswal said JSW Cement is 'well-positioned' to capitalize on the rising demand for GGBS, and is supported by long-term supply agreements for blast furnace slag. According to the MOSL note, GGBS made up around 34 percent of JSW Cement's total revenue for FY25, and its share in EBITDA was higher at 76 percent for FY25. The ongoing expansion plans at JSW Cement will soon see the company foray into the North region, where MOSL said profitability is 'better' compared to South India. ""It will also help JSW Cement reduce its capacity concentration in the South region to around 41 percent by FY28e from around 53 percent in FY25,"" said MOSL. However, this capex will keep the debt levels at JSW Cement elevated, said the note. ""We estimate a capex of Rs 5,600 crore during FY26-28e, which would be mainly for the Rajasthan integrated unit. The remaining capex will be used for a grinding unit of Shiva Cement, a greenfield unit in Punjab and brownfield capacity expansion in the south region,"" MOSL said. JSW Cement could see an improvement in its clinker-to-cement conversion for existing plants, along with higher-than-estimated GGBS volumes and better utilization for the North India plant, said MOSL, while pointing at a downside risk of lower trade volume, pricing pressure in South and delays in capacity commissioning in North India.

"Ola Electric, Tata Motors, Bajaj Auto rally up to 6% as China assures addressing rare earth magnet crunch",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/ola-electric-tata-motors-bajaj-auto-rally-up-to-6-as-china-assures-addressing-rare-earth-crunch-13466093.html,"Indian auto shares extended gains on Tuesday, with Ola Electric, Bajaj Auto, Hero MotoCorp, Hyundai Motor, Eicher Motors and Maruti Suzuki rising up to 6 percent in trade. The Nifty Auto index advanced 1 percent, buiglding on Monday’s near 5 percent jump after reports that the government may cut GST on vehicles to spur demand. The rally also found support from fresh signals out of New Delhi. According to CNBC TV-18, China’s foreign minister, currently in India for meetings, has assured that Beijing will address key concerns flagged by New Delhi, including the supply of rare earth magnets — a critical input for automakers — and tunnel boring machines. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates For auto manufacturers, the rare earth issue has been particularly acute. China accounts for about 90 percent of global production and supply, and shortages have already disrupted output. Bajaj Auto slashed production of its electric two-wheelers by as much as 50 percent in July, warning that volumes in August and September will also remain constrained. Hero MotoCorp, on its Q1FY26 earnings call, admitted the shortage is an industry-wide challenge but said it has secured enough supplies to cover both its internal combustion engine and electric vehicle models through the second quarter of FY26. The company added that key components such as EV motors and engine and wheel sensors, which rely heavily on rare earth magnets, are covered for now, while it continues to explore long-term alternatives. Tata Motors, India’s largest EV player, has also flagged rare earth magnets as a potential choke point. While its production has not been hit yet, the company is already working on alternative supply options to secure future operations. If Beijing’s assurances materialise, automakers could find much-needed relief from supply disruptions that have threatened production schedules, even as domestic demand prospects brighten with talk of a potential GST cut. At about 10:55 am, the Nifty Auto index was up 1 percent, with the top gainers being Ola Electric, Bajaj Auto, Tata Motors, Maruti Suzuki, Hero MotoCorp, Eicher Motors, Hyundai Motor India, and TVS Motor Company. The Nifty Auto index is up 11.21 percent since the beginning of the year.

During what is his first visit to India in three years, Wang Yi assured External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar that China is addressing India's needs related to fertilisers, CNBC-TV18 reported citing people familiar with the matter. He further assured that the Xi Jinping-led country will address India's concerns around rare earth magnets and tunnel boring machines, the report added. Another report said that China has already informed India that it is lifting export restrictions on fertilizers, rare earth magnets and tunnel boring machines. According to Economic Times, Yi told Jaishankar that the Chinese officials are working to remove the restrictions. Moneycontrol couldn't independently verify the reports. Agro Phos India shares jumped 5 percent to hit the upper circuit at Rs 38.92 apiece. Southern Petrochemicals and Zuari Agro Chemicals shares gained around 4 percent each. Paradeep Phosphates, Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilizers (RCF) and Fertilizers and Chemicals Travancore (FACT) shares were up nearly 3 percent each, while Gujarat State Fertilizers & Chemicals, Madras Fertilizers, Mangalore Chemicals & Fertilizers and Chambal Fertilizers shares gained more than 2 percent each. National Fertilizers shares were up over 1 percent. China had withheld shipments of critical fertilisers to India over the recent months. India reportedly imports nearly 80 percent of its specialty fertilisers, such as water-soluble nutrients, liquid foliar feeds, slow- and controlled-release variants, and bio-stimulants, from China. The two foreign ministers met on August 18 in New Delhi, ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s scheduled visit to China to attend the annual summit of Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO). A statement by the Chinese foreign ministry said the country is ready to uphold the principle of cordiality and mutual benefit with India. Wang will also meet Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval to discuss the two countries’ border dispute before calling on Prime Minister Narendra Modi later on August 19.

"Reliance shares rise over 2% on Jio tariff changes, positive brokerage calls",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/reliance-shares-rise-over-2-on-tariff-changes-positive-brokerage-calls-13465905.html,"Reliance Industries shares rose more than 2 percent in Tuesday’s trade after its Jio telecom unit announced changes in its prepaid tariffs. The gains were supported by upbeat brokerage commentary. On the NSE, RIL stock rose as much as 2.31 percent to Rs 1,413.60, extending gains into a second straight session. Reliance Jio has discontinued its entry-level 1GB per day prepaid packs priced at Rs 209 for 22 days and Rs 249 for 28 days. Following the revision, the effective entry plan now begins at Rs 299 for 1.5GB per day for 28 days, up from Rs 249 earlier. The move aligns Jio’s pricing with Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, which already charge Rs 299 for similar 28-day plans. Brokerage IIFL said the Rs 249 pack contributed less than 10 percent to Jio’s mobile revenues, and the 20 percent hike could directly lift overall revenue by under 2 percent. Axis Capital, however, expects the tariff changes to boost Jio’s FY26E revenue and average revenue per user (ARPU) by 4-5 percent, reported CNBC-TV18. Morgan Stanley said that Jio has removed its popular Rs 249 plan (1GB per day for 28 days) and Rs 199 plan (1.5GB per day for 18 days). With this, the lowest-priced daily data option for 28 days now starts at Rs 299. Domestic brokerages reiterated a ‘Buy’ rating on Reliance with a target price of Rs 1,690. Citi said the SEBI proposal on large IPOs could have meaningful positive implications for a potential Jio listing. Jefferies maintained its ‘Buy’ call with a target price of Rs 1,670, citing improving cash flows in Jio, steady growth in retail and continued investments in renewables in the oil-to-chemicals business. As of 10:30 am, 2.21 lakh shares of Reliance Industries worth Rs 31.06 crore changed hands on the BSE. On the NSE, more than 45 lakh shares were traded till the time of publishing. The company’s market value stood at more than Rs 19.1 lakh crore, according to BSE data. Disclaimer: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

The Finance Ministry issued a notification through the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC), removing both the basic customs duty and the Agriculture Infrastructure and Development Cess on cotton imports. The decision offers temporary relief to the textile and garment industry, which has been facing challenges amid concerns related to the Trump tariffs. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog This development comes after months of back-and-forth between the two countries. India has stood firm on sensitive sectors such as agriculture and dairy during bilateral trade talks. By easing duty on cotton, New Delhi is signaling some flexibility without giving up its core red lines. The government’s move is aimed at mitigating the pressure of a larger tariff of 50 percent imposed by the US government on Indian exports, the deadline for which is August 27. The exemption is expected to benefit the entire textile chain including yarn, fabric, garments, and made-ups. Meanwhile, the US negotiating team, which was scheduled to visit New Delhi for the sixth round of trade talks on August 25, has cancelled its visit. No fresh date has been announced so far. The move also reflects India’s domestic supply concerns. Cotton availability in the local market has been tight, with industry associations repeatedly warning about the risk of higher yarn prices and downstream cost pressures in textiles. By allowing duty-free imports, the government aims to ease raw material costs ahead of the festival season, a period when demand for garments typically rises.

"Fitch says second-order effects of US tariffs rising for India Inc, but a trade deal can reduce risks",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/fitch-says-second-order-effects-of-us-tariffs-rising-for-india-inc-but-a-trade-deal-can-reduce-risks-13466027.html,"Rating agency Fitch has said in a note that India Inc has 'generally' low direct exposure to US tariffs, however, sectors that are currently unaffected, such as Pharma, could be hit by further US tariff announcements, while adding that second-order effects too are on the rise. The note, however, added that a trade deal between US and India could reduce these risks, even as India stares at an additional 25 percent levy over its oil imports from Russia, effective from August 27. For Indian pharma companies, US is a key export market, and tariff risk on these items is not yet fully factored in, said Fitch, and could pose downside risks to these businesses. The note cited Biocon's example, which derives around 40 percent of its sales from US through products mostly manufactured in India and Malaysia. ""The competitive industry landscape could limit Biocon’s ability to pass on higher costs, despite the non-discretionary demand for its products,"" Fitch said. For crop production chemical producer UPL, US buyers make up for 10-12 percent of total revenue, and any tariff on its products could potentially affect its competitiveness in the American market. However, UPL still has 'significant' geographical and product diversification, Fitch added, which could mean the company will still be able to meet EBITDA growth guidance of 10-14 percent in constant currency terms, though the risk remains. ""...we see limited risk to our EBITDA growth estimate of 11 percent (in US dollar terms) and leverage forecast for the financial year ending March 2026,"" Fitch added. While India's direct exports of automotives to the US are limited, America still accounts for close to 20 percent of sales for auto supplier Samvardhana Motherson (SAMIL). These are supplied mostly from US production bases or from Mexico, which has secured a tariff exemption under an agreement. Still, Fitch had revised its Outlook on SAMIL to Stable from Positive in May 2025. Fitch said it expects a weak global auto sector outlook owing to tariff-related uncertainty. Fitch has assumed a very minimal direct tariff impact on Indian IT services, along with those companies that are domestically focused. Oil and gas, cement, engineering and construction, telecom and utilities are at lower risk of a direct impact. Though if US tariffs stay significantly higher than Asian peers, Fitch said it sees a moderate downside risk to India's growth forecast for FY26, which would weigh on the operating performance of India Inc. ""India’s corporates could also be affected if US tariffs divert supply to other markets, including India, as this could present downside risks to our domestic price assumptions for some products, such as steel and chemicals,"" the note added.

(IRSL). The company disclosed in a regulatory filing that it has signed agreements, last executed on August 18, to sell 49.6 lakh equity shares of IRSL, each with a face value of Rs 10.

Inox Wind’s consolidated profit after tax surged to Rs 105.8 crore in the June quarter, up from Rs 10.3 crore a year earlier, aided by higher other income and lower finance costs.

"Commercial vehicle outlook set to improve if GST, credit measures come through: Ashok Leyland",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/commercial-vehicle-outlook-set-to-improve-if-gst-credit-measures-come-through-ashok-leyland-13465599.html,"India’s commercial vehicle industry could be on the cusp of a turnaround if two policy measures fall into place — a reduction in Goods and Services Tax (GST) and easier access to credit. For Shenu Agarwal, managing director and chief executive of Ashok Leyland, these changes would not just lift sentiment but also trigger a sharp revival in demand, reshaping the growth path for FY26 and FY27. At present, commercial vehicles are taxed at 28 percent, among the highest rates in the GST structure. A cut to 18 percent, Agarwal told CNBC TV-18, would be a landmark shift. Lowering the tax burden would immediately reduce acquisition costs, encourage consumption, and ultimately generate more freight for the vehicles to carry. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates The other critical piece, he added, lies in financing. With more than 90 percent of CV purchases funded by loans, industry participants are watching for Reserve Bank of India measures that could ease credit flow to the sector. A combination of these two steps, Agarwal believes, would provide an instant boost to demand by addressing the twin hurdles of high upfront costs and tight financing. Ashok Leyland’s own performance in the June quarter reflected resilience in a testing environment. The company expanded its market share across key categories, gaining 1.3 percent in the medium and heavy commercial vehicle segment, led by a 1.8 percent rise in trucks. The bus business, however, ceded ground as demand shifted towards fully built vehicles. In the light commercial vehicle category, too, Ashok Leyland added 1.2 percent market share. Exports jumped 29 percent year-on-year, but despite the strong start, Agarwal has kept the FY26 growth target unchanged at 20–25 percent, pointing out that the company’s key overseas markets have remained insulated from global disruptions. Looking to the second quarter, Agarwal expects support from a low base to lift performance. On the electric mobility front, he said operations at Switch India have been stabilised, putting the unit on course to turn PAT positive by the end of FY26 — a milestone in the group’s EV journey. Also read: Unlisted shares slide sharply from June peak on IPO jitters The defence business, meanwhile, saw a year-on-year decline in the first quarter due to the execution of a large order in the same period last year, but the order book remains strong at around Rs 1,000 crore. Agarwal expects the vertical to deliver 25–30 percent topline growth this fiscal, backed by both fresh and repeat demand. Following Q1, UBS reiterated a “buy” call on the stock with a target price of Rs 150, highlighting that the company delivered a margin beat on the back of operational discipline. The brokerage noted that medium and heavy commercial vehicle (MHCV) growth is expected in mid-single digits, while light commercial vehicle (LCV) growth could be slightly better. At about 9:25 am, shares of the company were trading at Rs 128, lower by 3 percent as investors booked profit after a massive 7 percent rally in the previous session. Ashok Leyland shares are up 16 percent since the beginning of the year.

Proceeds from the fresh issue will be used to acquire new machinery for its Manekpur plant in Gujarat, repayment of debt, general corporate purposes, and expansion efforts. Financially, the company has been on a growth path. Between FY23 and FY25, revenue rose from Rs 443 crore to Rs 558 crore. Profit after tax (PAT) grew from Rs 28 crore to Rs 47 crore. The company’s operating performance also improved, with EBITDA margin rising to 18.12 percent in FY25, while return on equity stood at 19.01 percent.

Can Sensex and Nifty extend gains for a fourth session? Key levels to track on August 19,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/can-sensex-and-nifty-extend-gains-for-a-fourth-session-key-levels-to-track-on-august-19-13465363.html,"Indian equities are set for a steady start on Tuesday, with Nifty and Sensex poised to edge higher and extend their winning streak to a fourth straight session. At about 8:20 am, the Gift Nifty was at 24,995, higher by 0.1 percent or 29 points. Bulls were fired up in trade on Monday, August 18, leading the benchmark indices Nifty 50 and Sensex to stage a fiery rally of around one percent each, supported by sharp gains in auto, consumption, metal and realty stocks. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Foreign investors turned net buyers after 4 sessions on Monday, August 18, purchasing Indian equities worth Rs 551 crore. Domestic institutional investors (DIIs) also remained positive, buying shares worth Rs 4,104 crore, provisional data showed. Here are the key levels to watch out for in today's session On the daily chart, Nifty remains sandwiched between the 20-SMA (24,740), now acting as near-term support, and the 50-SMA (25,020). A failure to hold above the 50-SMA could underline the corrective tone. Looking ahead, the 25,020 mark remains the key level to watch. A decisive close above it could open the path toward 25,180–25,250, while support is well-placed at 24,740, followed by 24,600. Unless Nifty convincingly reclaims the 50-day SMA, the index may oscillate within the current range, with the risk of a pullback toward lower supports still on the table. ""On the daily chart, the Bank Nifty index remains positioned below the 20-SMA and the 50-SMA, which together form a resistance cluster. A decisive close above this region would be essential to establish stronger upside momentum. Until then, the rebound remains tentative and could easily slip back into consolidation,"" Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities said. ""The support remains at 55,400, followed by 55,200. The resistance remains firm at 55,900–56,150, coinciding with the moving average cluster. A sustained close above this band could unlock further upside, while failure to cross may keep the index confined within a broad consolidation range,"" he added. The Volatility remained subdued, with the India VIX easing to 12.34, down 0.12 percent. This indicates that broader sentiment has not reflected any significant anxiety. The Nifty Put-Call ratio (PCR), which indicates the mood of the market, dropped to 1.00 on August 18, compared to 1.01 in the previous session. The increasing PCR, or being higher than 0.7 or surpassing 1, means traders are selling more Put options than Call options, which generally indicates the firming up of a bullish sentiment in the market.

Asian stocks look subdued ahead of Jackson Hole,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/asian-stocks-look-subdued-ahead-of-jackson-hole-13465075.html,"markets moved in narrow ranges, with global equities holding near record highs, after Donald Trump’s meeting with Ukraine’s president and European leaders ended with a call for a summit with Russia. European equity-index futures gained 0.3% as the leaders of the US, Ukraine, Europe and NATO emerged from hours of meetings, touting progress on peace talks to end the war in Ukraine. Oil dipped 0.4% as traders weighed the impact of the talks on supply of the commodity. Asian shares were flat while mainland China stocks held near their decade-high level. Markets were cautiously optimistic on the Ukraine peace process after Trump urged Vladimir Putin to begin planning a summit with Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Investors face a pivotal week as the Federal Reserve’s annual Economic Policy Symposium kicks off Thursday in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, potentially offering signals on the path of interest rates. “Money is just waiting on the sidelines at the moment, until a fresh signal to move markets to fresh highs,” Nick Twidale, chief analyst at ATFX Global Markets in Sydney. “Investors were preparing for volatility after the talks but that has not eventuated and so they will now focus on central bank updates into the end of the week, with a huge focus on the Fed.” Trump called Putin and urged the Russian leader to begin making plans for a summit with Zelenskiy, after meeting the Ukrainian president and European leaders at the White House on Monday. The proposal — which Trump pitched as a one-on-one summit between Ukraine and Russia’s leaders that would be followed by a trilateral gathering involving all three — represented the latest turn in the US president’s push to broker a quick end to a conflict that has lasted over three years. “The lack of market reaction may reflect low expectations for a resolution of the Russia-Ukraine war,” said Mingze Wu, a currency trader at StoneX in Singapore. “The world has been chugging along for the past two-plus years now, so peace in Europe may not do much, which aids this inertia in market bets.” The markets are “laser-focused” on Jerome Powell’s speech on Friday, Wu said. Powell is expected to unveil the Fed’s new policy framework — the strategy it’ll use to achieve its inflation and employment goals. Powell may also drop some hints about the Fed’s thinking ahead of its September policy meeting."

"Sebi maintains retail quota in IPOs at 35%, drops plan for cut",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sebi-maintains-retail-quota-in-ipos-at-35-drops-plan-for-cut-13464868.html,"The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has withdrawn its proposal to reduce the retail quota in IPOs from 35 percent to 25 percent for issues exceeding Rs 5,000 crore. The proposal had been made considering the challenges faced by issuers in executing large offerings. Sebi said it has been constantly monitoring stakeholder feedback on the matter. Now the retail quota will remain as it is. In its consultation paper, Sebi said that the challenges of lower retail subscription in large issues would be addressed through the current proposal of allowing lower stake dilution for such companies. Sebi, in its consultation paper on the Review of Requirement of Minimum Public Offer and Timelines to Comply with MPS Norms under SCRR, floated on Monday, noted: “It is proposed that the retail quota in IPO allocations be retained at 35%, in line with Regulation 32 of SEBI (ICDR) Regulations, 2018, and accordingly, the consultation paper dated July 31, 2025, may be considered as modified to that extent.” On Monday, Sebi floated another consultation paper proposing that large companies with a post-listing market cap of Rs 50,000 crore and above be allowed to list with lower stake dilution and be given more time to comply with minimum public shareholding (MPS) norms. Sebi’s earlier proposal to reduce the retail quota in large IPOs had been met with strong views from investors and market participants. Market participants argued that Sebi should not only consider retail subscription data in such large issues but also evaluate pricing as a key factor. Sebi has been hinting to companies and merchant bankers about pricing issues but refrained from issuing any directions because it may be considered micro-management or interference in the market dynamics. In the July 31, 2025 consultation paper, Sebi had proposed a flexible retail allocation framework for IPOs exceeding Rs 5,000 crore. The plan allowed the retail quota to fall from 35 percent to 25 percent in a staggered manner, while increasing the qualified institutional buyer (QIB) quota from 50 percent to 60 percent to ensure demand stability. The July paper stated: “It is proposed to revise the issue structure for large IPOs (i.e., those exceeding Rs 5,000 crore) under Regulation 6(1) of the SEBI (ICDR) Regulations. Specifically, the allocation to the Retail category may be reduced from the existing 35% to 25% in a graded manner, while the allocation to the QIB category may be increased from 50% to 60% (up to Rs 8,000 crore) in a graded manner.” Sebi also highlighted subscription challenges. It noted: “Given the present allocation methodology and experience in recent issues, these large retail portions require lakhs of retail applicants for the category to be fully subscribed.” For example, Hyundai Motor’s Rs 27,859 crore IPO saw retail subscription at just 0.4x; Hexaware Technologies’ Rs 8,750 crore issue was subscribed 0.1x; and Afcons Infra’s Rs 5,430 crore IPO saw just 0.9x subscription. Sebi estimated that for a Rs 5,000 crore IPO, the minimum retail application size requires about 7–8 lakh bidders. For larger issues, such as a Rs 10,000 crore offer, at least 1.75 million applications would be needed. The regulator further explained its rationale, noting that mutual funds already have a 5 percent reservation within the QIB category in both anchor and non-anchor portions, which indirectly represents retail investors. “Reducing the retail portion from 35% to 25% in a graded manner and increasing the QIB share to 60% better reflects market realities, ensures demand stability, and enhances issuer confidence in volatile or clustered market conditions,” it said. Importantly, the consultation paper also proposed enhancing the reservation for mutual funds from the existing 5 percent to 15 percent in the Non-Anchor QIB category. “While direct participation by retail investors has remained flat over the last three years, their participation through MFs has seen a secular uptick. Thus, the lower allocation to the Retail portion would be compensated by the higher reservation for domestic MFs in the QIB portion,” Sebi added. Sebi had received feedback from industry associations and merchant bankers to reduce the retail quota and later sought public feedback through a consultation paper."
"NSE, BSE prefer adjustments in existing indices to meet Sebi’s norms for F&O indices, Sebi seeks public feedback",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/nse-bse-prefer-adjustments-in-existing-indices-to-meet-sebi-s-norms-for-f-o-indices-sebi-seeks-public-feedback-13464809.html,"India’s leading stock exchanges, NSE and BSE, have both favoured tweaking the structure of their existing non-benchmark indices rather than creating new ones, as they respond to Sebi’s prudential norms for eligibility of derivatives on such indices. In a consultation paper released on August 18, 2025, Sebi stakeholders’ feedback on how to operationalize rules laid down in its May 29 circular. The regulator had mandated that Non-Benchmark Indices must have at least 14 constituents, with no single stock carrying more than 20 percent weightage, the weightage of top three stocks together capped at 45 percent, and a descending weight structure for all constituents. The move aims to ensure that indices supporting derivatives contracts remain broad-based and not concentrated in just few stocks. Also read: Sebi panel on Takeover Regulations reviews definition of control, no tweaks to open offer and creeping acquisition threshold BSE backs quick fix for BankexBSE in its feedback, suggested to Sebi that it has only one Non-Benchmark Index affected i.e. the Bankex, which currently comprises 10 constituents. Also, no ETFs or index funds track Bankex, the exchange said the simplest way would be a one-time adjustment of constituents and weights to bring the index in line with Sebi’s prescribed thresholds. NSE for adjustment path for Nifty Bank and Fin NiftyNSE, said it has two indices, Nifty Bank with 12 constituents and Nifty Financial Services or Fin Nifty with 20 constituents are widely tracked, with ETF and index fund assets under management (AUM) of around Rs 34,251 crore and Rs 511 crore, respectively, as of June 30, 2025. NSE has argued against creating new indices, noting that this could fragment liquidity, disrupt the derivatives market built around these benchmarks, and confuse investors with multiple indices in the same space. NSE said, the weightage of constituents in one index is in the range of around 29 percent to 2 percent and in another index is in the range of around 33 percent to 0.4 percent. For Fin Nifty, where the passive fund exposure is smaller, it is proposed that a single-tranche adjustment could suffice. NSE carried out discussions with various market participants including Mutual Funds, AMFI representatives, etc. During the discussions, it was represented by market participants that using existing Non-Benchmark Indices for derivatives over prescribing new indices for them would be beneficial on account of following reasons: Also read: Sebi proposes less stake dilution, more timeline for public shareholding compliance for large IPOs What’s the proposal for glide path? A glide path approach has been proposed for such indices, having weightage of top constituent more than Sebi’s prescribed 20 percent. For example, if the top stock currently has a weight of 28 percent against the required cap of 20 percent, the excess would be trimmed in stages, with adjustments recalibrated each month to account for price movements. This staggered approach would allow large passive funds to realign portfolios in an orderly way, minimizing sudden inflows and outflows in individual stocks. The new constituents would be added in tranche1.The top 3 constituents will have a target weight at the end of tranche 4. In each 4 adjustment, the weight of top 3 constituents would be checked and if the weights are beyond the prudential norms, the excess would be targeted for reduction equally over the remaining tranches. How adjustments will take place? At each trance a formula will be followed like in start of the month 1 it will be (Actual weight -desired weight)/4, for start of month 2 it will be (Actual weight -desired weight)/3, for start of the third month it will be (Actual weight -desired weight)/2 and at the start of the fourth month, will be (Actual weight -desired weight). The excess weight after adjustment from the top constituents would be distributed amongst the other constituents as long as they meet the prudential norm. Sebi has invited feedback from stakeholders on whether exchanges should proceed with weight and constituent adjustments in their existing indices, and whether the proposed modalities, including glide path plan are appropriate. Sebi has sought comments on the proposal until September 8, 2025. Why this proposal? Sebi was of the view that higher concentrtion of few select stocks in indices may lead to manipulation. In the recent interim order of Jane Street, Sebi had alleged that Jane Stret Group entities manipulated Nifty Bank by taking opposite positions in the Index and three key constituents of the index, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank which had a total weightage of 65 percent among the 12 constituents."

"Sebi proposes less stake dilution, more timeline for public shareholding compliance for large IPOs",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sebi-proposes-less-stake-dilution-more-timeline-for-public-shareholding-compliance-for-large-ipos-13464688.html,"Market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has proposed lesser stake dilution and more time for compliance with minimum public shareholding norms. Moneycontrol had reported on July 24 that Sebi may allow IPO of big companies with less stake dilution. Sebi has issued a consultation paper with some tweaks after advice of its primary market advisory panel and internal discussions. In a consultation paper issued on Monday, based on industry inputs, the tweaks have been suggested as a relaxation for large issuers with a post-issue market cap of more than Rs 50,000 crore. Sebi, in its consultation paper, proposed that for IPOs with a post-issue market cap above Rs 50,000 crore but not more than Rs 1,00,000 crore, the minimum issue size will be Rs 1,000 crore plus at least 8 percent of the post-issue share capital. Currently, it is 10 percent of the issue size. For such issues, the minimum public shareholding (MPS) of 25 percent is to be achieved within 5 years from the date of listing instead of 3 years at present. For issues of Rs 1,00,000 crore but not more than Rs 5,00,000 crore, the minimum issue size will be Rs 6,250 crore plus at least 2.75 percent of the post-issue share capital. For such large issues, the timeline for achieving the minimum public shareholding (MPS) is also proposed to be extended. The Sebi paper has proposed that in case public shareholding on the date of listing is less than 15 percent, MPS of 15 percent should be achieved within 5 years and 25 percent within 10 years. In case the public shareholding is above 15 percent on the date of listing, MPS of 25 percent should be achieved within 5 years from the date of listing. Existing norms say MPS of 10 percent should be achieved within 2 years and 25 percent within 5 years from the date of listing. For issues of more than Rs 5,00,000 crore market cap post issue, Sebi has proposed that the minimum stake dilution should be Rs 15,000 crore plus at least 1 percent of post-issue share capital, subject to a minimum dilution of 2.5 percent of post-issue share capital. The minimum public shareholding compliance timeline for such large issues is also proposed to be extended. The Sebi paper says that in case public shareholding is less than 15 percent on the date of listing, MPS of 15 percent should be achieved within 5 years and 25 percent within 10 years from the date of listing. If public shareholding is above 15 percent on the date of listing, MPS of 25 percent should be achieved within 5 years from the date of listing. Sebi, in its paper, justified the proposed tweaks and noted that as the size of IPOs is increasing year on year, flexibility in terms of minimum issue size and timelines to achieve public shareholding for large companies has become challenging. Hence, the need was felt to review the provisions of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules, 1957 (SCRR). Therefore, a recommendation by the Sebi board needs to be considered to amend the SCRR by the Ministry of Finance. An amendment in the SCRR will provide flexibility to large companies in meeting the requirements of minimum offer size and timelines to achieve public shareholding. Sebi has sough public comments on the proposal by September 8. Also read: Sebi panel on Takeover Regulations reviews definition of control, no tweaks to open offer and creeping acquisition threshold Sebi noted, “Feedback from stakeholders suggests that large issuers face challenges in undertaking substantial dilution of equity shares through IPOs, as such large offerings may be difficult for the market to absorb. These constraints can act as a deterrent for large issuers from considering listing in India, thereby limiting investment opportunities for Indian investors.” The Sebi paper further said, “Such large issuers also face challenges in meeting the MPS requirements within the prescribed timelines. Issuers that dilute only 5–10 percent of their share capital at the time of the IPO are required to dilute an additional 15–20 percent of their share capital within 5 years of listing.” The Sebi paper highlighted the challenges faced by larger and profitable companies having substantial cash reserves, that are not in a high-growth phase and lack the need to raise significant capital at regular intervals. Similarly, Public Sector Undertakings also encounter difficulties in adhering to the minimum public shareholding timelines. In a consultation paper, the regulator has proposed tweaking the post-issue market capitalisation threshold also. The existing threshold of Rs 4,000 to the Rs 1,00,000 market cap has been bifurcated into two parts. The proposed parts are Rs 4000 to Rs 50,000 crore and another of Rs 50,000 crore to Rs 1,00,000 crore. Res of the thresholds will remain unchanged.

Sebi extends deadline for margin obligations pledge framework on request by depositories,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sebi-extends-deadline-for-margin-obligations-pledge-framework-on-request-by-depositories-13464234.html,"Market regulator Sebi has granted market intermediaries additional time to comply with the new framework on margin obligations through pledge and re-pledge of securities. In a circular issued on August 18, the regulator said the revised mechanism - originally scheduled to come into effect from September 1, 2025 - will now be implemented from October 10, 2025. Sebi had on June 3, 2025, issued a detailed circular mandating that all margin obligations in the equity and derivatives segment be fulfilled only through the depository system of pledges and re-pledges, a move aimed at plugging gaps in the existing process and ensuring greater safety of investors’ securities. However, depositories CDSL and NSDL sought additional time and informed the regulator that significant system-level changes, testing of new processes and readiness of participants can take longer. Accepting their request, Sebi said the extension was being granted to ‘ensure smooth implementation without any disruption for market participants and investors’. How the New System Works The new pledge-and-re-pledge framework is designed to create a transparent, automated trail of client securities that are offered as collateral. Once invoked, a client’s securities will be blocked for early pay-in directly within their demat account, thereby reducing the possibility of misuse by brokers. Another key feature is the introduction of a ‘pledge release for pay-in’ functionality. With this single instruction, the pledged securities can be released and a simultaneous pay-in block created in the client’s demat account. This eliminates the need for multiple instructions or manual intervention. Depositories will be responsible for enabling the required infrastructure and functionality, Sebi had said. Once the framework goes live from October 2025, brokers will no longer need to seek separate physical or electronic instructions for un-pledging and delivery, and the system itself will validate and process the client’s pay-in obligations automatically. Why it Matters The initiative is part of Sebi’s broader efforts to strengthen investor protection and market transparency. Over the years, instances of brokers misusing client securities have highlighted risks in the margin funding process. By mandating that all pledges, re-pledges, and releases move through a controlled depository system, Sebi is aiming to curb erroneous practices while easing compliance for intermediaries. With the new deadline set for October 10, all intermediaries, brokers and depositories have a little over seven weeks to test, adapt and fully align their systems with the regulator’s mandate."

Thus, EBITDA margins came in at 23.5% (+220bps YoY). The company has also commissioned its nacelle plant near Ahmedabad, to aid margins in the long run. However, we believe margins for the full year will be closer to the guided 18%. We believe the lower order inflow (OI) - of 51MW in Q1 reduces the visibility of revenues in FY27E. Thus, we are tapering FY27E estimates on execution to 1.5GW (from 1.7GW earlier). The company is undergoing restructuring of its various businesses to streamline the balance sheet (discussed below). Given the industry tailwinds and sharp drop in the stock price, we maintain a BUY on the stock with a revised TP of INR 170 (vs INR 230 earlier) Outlook We maintain BUY on the stock with an SoTP-based revised target price of INR 170/share (earlier INR 230) as we taper FY27E execution estimates by ~15%, valuing the wind business at 30x FY27E EPS.

Better product/segment mix and premiumisation drove gross margin up 140bps YoY; however, higher advertisement and promotional expenditure drove decline in EBITDA margin to 12.7%, down 40bps YoY and below I-Sec’s estimate of 13.5%.

Buy Bharat Petroleum Corporation; target of Rs 390: ICICI Securities,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/buy-bharat-petroleum-corporation-target-of-rs-390-icici-securities-13463570.html,"ICICI Securities's research report on Bharat Petroleum Corporation BPCL’s Q1FY26 EBITDA/PAT of INR 96.6bn/INR 61.2bn jumped 71%/2x YoY (+24%/91% QoQ). This was despite a USD 3/bbl YoY dip in GRMs, as stronger marketing earnings and higher other income have offset the GRM weakness. While GRMs and retail margins have both moderated QoQ, the imminent payout of INR 75–80bn towards LPG losses and steadily reducing LPG losses (INR 50/cyn rise in prices and lower international LPG prices have helped pare losses to INR 100/cyn, from INR 150/cyn in Q1) help offset the weakness. Our BUY rating stays, driven by: 1) likely uptick in GRM aided by demand recovery; 2) steady retail fuel margins; 3) lower LPG losses; 4) comfortable leverage; 5) robust dividend yield; and 6) revival of Mozambique project. Our TP stands revised to INR 390 (from INR 380). Outlook we believe investments in Mozambique, Russia and Brazil deserve to be looked at in the overall SoTP of BPCL; and, in our view, adding meaningful upside to BPCL’s overall value. Our valuation, based on 5.5x EV/EBITDA for core refining + marketing business, CMP for listed investments and 2–4/boe EV for upstream assets delivers a TP of INR 390, viz. a 23% upside. Maintain BUY.

Click to View More Outlook for August 19 Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities Today, the benchmark indices bounced back sharply. The Nifty ends 251 points higher, while the Sensex was up by 696 points. Among sectors, Auto and Consumer indices outperformed, with Auto gaining 4% and Consumer up by 3.30%. Despite strong market sentiment, the IT index registered intraday profit booking at higher levels. Technically, after a gap-up open, the market witnessed intraday selling pressure at higher levels. However, it succeeded in closing above the 20-day SMA (Simple Moving Average) or 24,750/81000, which is largely positive. We believe that the short-term market outlook is positive, but buy on intraday dips and sell on rallies would be the ideal strategy for day traders. On the downside, 24,800/81000 and the 20-day SMA of 24,750/80800 would be key support levels, while 25,000 (50-day SMA)/81700 and 25,100/82000 could act as crucial resistance areas for the bulls. However, below 24,750/80800, the uptrend would become vulnerable. In that case, traders may prefer to exit their long positions. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities Nifty opened with a gap-up but faced initial resistance at 25,000, leading to an intraday decline due to profit booking at higher levels. The sentiment, however, remains positive, with the potential to revisit 25,000 in the coming days. Immediate support is placed at 24,800, below which the index may drift towards 24,500. On the higher side, a decisive move above 25,000 could trigger a larger rally in the market.

M&M shares gain 4% on GST rejig hopes; Vision 2027 SUV strategy adds tailwind,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/m-m-shares-gain-4-on-gst-rejig-hopes-vision-2027-suv-strategy-adds-tailwind-13463361.html,"Automobile giant Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) rose as much as 5 percent to Rs 3,432 on Monday, August 18, after reports suggested the government is considering a major overhaul of GST rates on entry-level two-wheelers, compact cars and hybrid vehicles. As a result, the Nifty Auto index rallied as much as 4 percent. The buzz follows Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Independence Day pitch for a simplified two-slab GST structure, expected to be rolled out by Diwali. According to a CNBC TV-18 report, policymakers are weighing a uniform 18 percent GST on mass-market vehicles, which would mark a steep cut from the current 28–31 percent levies that vary with engine size, length and ground clearance. Luxury cars and SUVs, however, are likely to remain in the highest bracket of around 40 percent. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates If implemented, the rejig could significantly reduce ownership costs for middle-class buyers while unlocking fresh demand across the auto sector. Analysts also expect the benefits to ripple through the supply chain, aiding component makers as well. Brokerages flagged M&M among the key winners in passenger vehicles under the new regime. Separately, Mahindra & Mahindra grabbed attention with the unveiling of its Global Vision 2027 roadmap. At the core is NU_IQ, a new modular multi-energy SUV platform designed to underpin the company’s global SUV strategy. The auto major also showcased four concept SUVs — Vision S, Vision T, Vision SXT and Vision X — slated to hit production lines from 2027.

At about 3:15 pm, shares of the company were trading at Rs 3,383, higher by 3.6 percent from the last close on the NSE. M&M shares have risen over 12 percent since the beginning of the year.

Broader indices outperformed, reversing the morning trend and gaining more than the frontline benchmarks. At about 12:25 pm, the Sensex was up 738.94 points or 0.92 percent at 81,336.60, and the Nifty was up 264.70 points or 1.07 percent at 24,896.00. About 2295 shares advanced, 1339 shares declined, and 143 shares remained unchanged. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates The market is riding strong tailwinds with potential for further gains. Prime Minister Modi’s Independence Day announcement on major GST reforms by Diwali is seen as a big positive, with expectations that most goods and services will be moved into the 5 percent and 18 percent tax slabs, V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments Ltd, said. ""The upgrade of India’s sovereign rating by S&P is another key boost. However, negative developments are capping sentiment. India-US trade talks are unlikely before the August 27 deadline, and the risk of a 50 percent tariff from Washington continues to loom. Markets will also closely track the outcome of the White House meeting today on the Russia-Ukraine conflict,"" he added. At mid-day, the rally was led by auto stocks with the Nifty Auto index surging 4.6 percent, while consumer durables and realty also gained sharply, up 3.4 percent and 2.2 percent, respectively. Banking stocks were firm, with both private and PSU banks advancing over 1 percent. FMCG, metals and infrastructure indices added to the strength. On the flip side, IT and pharma remained under pressure, down 0.5 percent and 0.4 percent, while energy and oil & gas were flat. The India VIX inched 1.2 percent higher to 12.5, reflecting a slight uptick in volatility. Among stock moves, India's largest auto maker, Maruti Suzuki, rallied over 9 percent, recording their sharpest single-day rise in five years after reports of a likely GST cut on entry-level two-wheelers, compact cars and hybrids. Morgan Stanley noted that Hero MotoCorp and Eicher Motors stand to gain the most among two-wheelers, with Maruti Suzuki and M&M emerging as key beneficiaries in passenger vehicles. Ashok Leyland climbed 7 percent after the company reported an in-line set of June quarter (Q1FY26) numbers. The Street cheered its steady operating performance, with brokerages turning positive on the counter and projecting further gains of up to 15 percent from the day’s high. UBS reiterated a “buy” call on the stock with a target price of Rs 150, highlighting that the company delivered a margin beat on the back of operational discipline. Also read: Brokerages see autos, cement, ACs and consumption stocks as top GST 2.0 winners Banking and non-banking financial institutions such as HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, and Bajaj Finance rallied up to 6 percent after credit ratings agency S&P Global upgraded the ratings of the top 10 financial institutions, saying that India's financial institutions will continue to ride the country's good economic growth momentum. Vodafone Idea shares rallied as much as 8 percent as investors took heart from the telco’s June quarter performance, where losses narrowed sequentially. The upbeat tone in the broader market also added to the momentum. Net loss came in at Rs 6,608 crore, wider than the Rs 6,432 crore loss a year ago but an improvement from Rs 7,166 crore reported in the March quarter. Technical View ""A decisive move above 24,750 could open the way for an upside toward 24,900 and 25,000, while immediate support lies at 24,600 and 24,500 — both considered attractive zones for fresh long positions,"" Amruta Shinde of Choice Equity Broking said. ""Similarly, the Bank Nifty also opened flat and consolidated within a narrow range of 55,000–55,500 during the session. A breakout from this range, supported by strong price action, is likely to determine the next directional move. Key supports are placed at 55,000 and 54,900, while resistance is seen in the 55,670–56,000 zone. A convincing breakout above this resistance range could pave the way for a rally toward the psychological 56,200 level,"" she added. Maruti Suzuki, Nestle, Hero MotoCorp, Bajaj Finance, and M&M were the top gainers on the Nifty. Laggards on the index included Dr Reddy's, Larsen & Toubro, Infosys, HCL Tech, and ITC.

The sharp rise in the share prices pushed the Nifty Capital Markets index up nearly 2 percent to hover around 4,483 in the afternoon. Benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty rallied sharply, buoyed by multiple factors. While delivering his Independence Day speech, Prime Minister Narendra Modi hinted at the next generation of Goods and Services Tax (GST) reforms to be announced as a Diwali gift for consumers. This significantly boosted optimism in the stock markets, pushing the benchmark index Sensex up 1,000 points, and Nifty over 25,000-mark. International credit ratings agency S&P Global on August 14 upgraded India's long-term sovereign credit ratings to 'BBB' from 'BBB-'. Economists have positively reacted to the upgrade, stating that it reflects on India’s prudent fiscal policy. A day later, S&P Global upgraded ratings of top 10 financial institutions, saying that India's financial institutions will continue to ride the country's good economic growth momentum. The positive commentary from the international ratings agency boosted market sentiment further. The rising optimism pushed India Vix up over 2 percent. This likely benefitted the capital market stocks. Anand Rathi Wealth shares were the top gainer on the index, jumping nearly 5 percent to trade at Rs 2,839 apiece. HDFC AMC and NAM-India shares followed, jumping up to 4 percent each. Multi Commodity Exchange of India (MCX) and UTI AMC shares rose around 2 percent each, while CDSL, Angel One and Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) shares gained more than 1 percent each.

"Power posted a mixed quarter after early monsoon cut demand, but here’s why hopes of a recovery ride high",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/power-posted-a-mixed-quarter-after-early-monsoon-cut-demand-but-here-s-why-hopes-of-a-recovery-ride-high-13461950.html,"During the June quarter, India’s power producers delivered mixed earnings - weighed down by weak demand due to a shorter summer season - but the second quarter could see improvements across the board, barring merchant power companies, experts have said, pointing towards divergence in valuations. An early onset of monsoon lowered cooling requirement, as nearly 60 percent of Q1FY26 days saw above-normal rainfall, and only 12 days recorded both high temperature and humidity, according to a note by SBI Capital Markets. As a result, the energy supplied fell 1.5% on-year - the first June quarter decline since FY16 (excluding the pandemic year) – as weather trends squeezed demand. SBI Caps said this volatility in demand could weigh on high-cost producers, forcing them to rely on merchant price spikes to seek returns. Weak Demand Hurt Growth Rupesh Sankhe, Senior VP - Research at Elara Capital said Q1 results were broadly in-line despite the quarter’s low demand. “That impacted merchant prices and volumes. Players like JSW Energy, Adani, and Torrent Power have shown slightly weaker numbers, but it was expected,” he said, adding that regulated players like NTPC, Tata Power and CESC too saw slower growth due to lower incentive income. Pankaj Kumar, VP – Fundamental Research at Kotak Securities said that muted capacity growth and execution bottlenecks have added to the drag. “In Q1FY26, the Indian electric utilities sector delivered a mixed performance. Quarterly performance was largely driven by acquisitions (by JSW Energy), renewable project execution, etc., but execution bottlenecks, muted organic capacity additions impacted the overall performance.” Renewables Hold the Key Sankhe added that renewables outperformed merchant players, owing to a higher plant load factor (PLF), especially in wind generation, due to the early onset of monsoon. “Even for the renewables, the entire ecosystem like ETC, solar sales, model manufacturers, they have also shown very good improvement in their top line as well as profitability,” said Sankhe. Margins in coal and regulated businesses slipped on lower incentives while renewable margins improved on better PLF and cost control. Company Scorecard Renewable energy players like Adani Green and JSW Energy outpaced peers, but hybrid player Tata Power too managed to post solid growth. Among regulated utilities, NTPC and Power Grid saw a muted show as incentive income fell, while Torrent Power, reliant on merchant power, was hit by weaker spot prices. Industrial suppliers CG Power, Thermax and market platform IEX delivered steady results, while BHEL lagged behind in the June quarter. Among financiers, PFC and REC maintained double-digit growth, and overall, the power sector revenue growth averaged around 1.6 percent YoY while PAT fell 11.6 percent. The Valuation Scorecard Based on the current price-to-book (P/B), regulated power majors like NTPC (1.79x vs peak 2.67x) and Power Grid (2.86x vs peak 3.90x) are currently trading well below their historic highs, which shows room for re-rating if earnings recover. Tata Power at 3.43x is also below its 4.79x peak P/B. The price-to-book ratio of renewables and equipment makers remain expensive, with Adani Green at 12.15x (peak 33.35x), CG Power at 26.19x (43.44x), and Suzlon at 14.11 x (29.41 x). Industrial such as Thermax (7.96x vs 14.57x) and Hitachi Energy (21.88x vs 50.23x) are still richly valued compared with peers. “The valuations remain rich across the sector, with most positives priced in, leaving ACME Solar as the only compelling risk-reward opportunity,” Pankaj Kumar, VP – Fundamental Research at Kotak Securities said. Elara’s Rupesh Sankhe, on the other hand, is upbeat about the sector’s medium-to-long-term prospects even as valuations have diverged. “There’s nothing negative in the latest commentary, no signs of project delays, no slowdown in demand. Sentiment on the sector should stay positive for the next four or five years,” Sankhe said. He pointed out that regulated utilities such as NTPC and CESC are trading at attractive price-to-book multiples of below 2x, a range considered as ‘decent’ for investors. Tata Power too falls into a reasonable bracket, he added. In contrast, valuations of merchant power companies like SJVN Power and JSW Energy are on the ‘higher side’ at above 3x price-to-book. “Anything more than 3x is on the expensive side; below 1.5–2x is low,” Sankhe explained. Power Financiers Shweta Daptardar, VP – Equity Research (NBFCs), Elara Capital said the growth for PFC and REC was ‘softer this quarter’ due to foreign exchange losses and slower government capex. “PFC’s YoY growth looked higher than REC’s because of a one-off; sequentially, it was barely one percent and is still weakish,” she said, adding that valuations remain subdued. “PFC trades below book after adjusting for its REC stake, and REC is around 1x, reflecting slow project execution.” Outlook for Q2FY26 Elara’s Sankhe expects regulated players to maintain momentum, but merchant power businesses may remain under pressure. “From Q2 onwards, we will see better numbers for the other players as well, except for our merchants. Merchant business will continue to get impacted in Q2,” he said. Most brokerages have been optimistic about the power sector, with UBS forecasting a 305 GW power capacity additions in FY25-30E - triple the FY20–25 pace - driven by strong OEM orderbooks. Thermal power should account for around 40 percent of incremental generation, said UBS, aiding grid stability and meeting the government’s ~80 GW target by FY32. Solar power commissioning may reach only 60 percent of the announced capacity for the year, which might ease over-capacity risks and enable consolidation among stronger incumbents.

"Cement stocks rally on hopes of GST cut, brokerages see demand boost ahead",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/cement-stocks-rally-on-hopes-of-gst-cut-brokerages-see-demand-boost-ahead-13462195.html,"Cement stocks were in full swing on August 18, with Ultratech Cement, JK Cement, ACC, Shree Cement, and others rallying as much as 5 percent after reports of potential changes in the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime sparked optimism. Currently, cement is taxed at 28 percent under GST, making it costlier compared to other construction inputs such as tiles and metals that fall under the 18 percent slab. According to Choice Broking, while there is no certainty yet, cement could soon be brought under the 18 percent bracket—a move that could be a game changer for the sector. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog A 10 percent cut in GST would directly reduce costs for end consumers, provided the benefit is passed on immediately. Analysts believe affordable cement would boost demand in both housing and infrastructure, in line with the government’s vision of Housing for All, Smart Cities, and large-scale infra expansion. This structural demand push could take cement industry’s volume growth from the earlier 8–9 percent range to 8–10 percent annually, creating a strong growth runway for cement manufacturers. ICICI Securities noted that a possible tax cut would act as a major sentiment booster for the sector. Every 1 percent change in realisations, it added, can swing EBITDA by nearly 3–5 percent, making a lower GST rate a significant earnings driver for cement companies. Axis Securities, meanwhile, expects cement demand in FY26 to remain robust on the back of sustained infrastructure investments, healthy housing demand, and rural recovery. The brokerage projected high single-digit growth in volumes, with nearly 40 mtpa of new capacity set to be added in FY26, on top of 30–35 mtpa in FY25—reflecting long-term confidence in demand. On August 15, the Centre proposed moving to a simplified GST structure standard and merit — with special rates reserved only for select items. The proposal was sent to the Group of Ministers, set up by the GST Council, and is part of a broader plan for next-generation GST reforms.

Buy PG Electroplast; target of Rs 623: Geojit Financial Services,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-pg-electroplast-target-of-rs-623-geojit-financial-services-13462190.html,"Geojit Financial Services research report on PG Electroplast PG Electroplast Ltd (PGEL), the flagship entity of PG Group is a leading electronic manufacturing service provider in India, having a diverse portfolio and panIndia presence. In Q1FY26, PGEL reported a revenue growth of ~14% YoY, which is in line with our estimates. However, air conditioner sales faced significant headwinds due to the early onset of the monsoon, which disrupted the seasonal volumes. EBITDA margin declined by 183bps YoY to 8.1% due to negative operating leverage and input cost pressure. The company expects FY26 margin to decline by 1.25-1.5% YoY due to pricing pressure and higher channel inventory. PGEL expects inventory to be cleared in H2FY26 as the seasonal demand picks up. Washing machine sales were robust during the quarter, reported a growth of 36% YoY. PGEL expects the segment to grow 40-45% YoY in FY26. We expect the management’s focus to diversify to other business verticals like refrigerator, EV and compressor manufacturing to keep the longterm story intact. Outlook The stock is currently trading at its 3-year average 1-year forward P/E of 42x, and we expect most of the negatives are factored into the price. We therefore revise our rating to BUY with a downwardly revised TP of Rs 623, based on a P/E of 40x on FY27E EPS.

"Bajaj Finance, Axis Bank, HDFC Bank shares rise up to 6% on S&P upgrade, GST reform cheer",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/bajaj-finance-axis-bank-hdfc-bank-shares-rise-up-to-6-on-s-p-upgrade-gst-reform-cheer-13461688.html,"The shares of banks and non-banking financial institutions saw strong rise in the morning trading hours of August 18. The sharp rise in the share prices pushed the Nifty Bank and Nifty Financial Services indices higher in the deep green. The Nifty Bank index was up more than 1.3 percent to hover around 56,035, while the Nifty Financial Services index rose nearly 2 percent to stand at 26,810, as seen at 10.10 am. Here are some of the key reasons leading to the uptrend in the financial pocket of the stock market: S&P upgrade: International credit ratings agency S&P Global on August 15 upgraded ratings of top 10 financial institutions, saying that India's financial institutions will continue to ride the country's good economic growth momentum. S&P has raised long-term issuer credit ratings on seven Indian banks - State Bank of India (SBI), ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Union Bank of India, and Indian Bank, and three finance companies - Bajaj Finance, Tata Capital, and L&T Finance. ""We expect India's banks to maintain adequate asset quality, good profitability, and enhanced capitalization over the next 12-24 months. This is despite some pockets of stress,"" S&P said, adding, credit risk in the system has reduced. This boosted investor sentiment for the stocks, as well as the broader sector, a day after US-based agency raised India's sovereign credit rating. ""S&P upgrade...is a significant macro and structural positive for the overall Indian market, likely supporting incremental valuation expansion driven by lower bond yields and decreased risk perception. Moreover, a higher sovereign rating will drive better FPI debt flows and lead to better USDINR and GOI bond yields. Foreign currency-heavy borrowers can benefit from lower interest costs. Indian financial companies, such as Bajaj Finance, accessing the ECB market could see a 15-20bp reduction on their coupon payments,"" said Motilal Oswal Financial Services. GST reforms: While delivering his Independence Day speech, Prime Minister Narendra Modi hinted at the next generation of Goods and Services Tax (GST) reforms to be announced as a Diwali gift for consumers. The Centre has proposed to move towards ""simple tax"" with 2 slabs—""standard and merit"", with special rates applicable for only for select few items. According to reports, this will significantly reduce tax burden on consumers aiming to buy several items, like electronics and other consumer durables. More demand for consumer durables may in turn boost stocks like Bajaj Finance who offer affordable EMIs to consumers to purchase several goods. Broader market uptrend: The sharp rise in the share prices also comes amid broader optimism in the stock market today. Sensex jumped over 1,000 points to hover around 81,629, while Nifty crossed the key 25,000-mark level. HDFC AMC and several other stocks will likely be strongly benefitted from the optimism in the stock markets. Bajaj Finance shares jumped more than 6 percent, while Chola Finance, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company, Bajaj Finsev and SBI Life shares were up more than 4 percent, leading the strong gains on the Nifty Financial Services index. IndusInd Bank shares rose nearly 3 percent, while AU Small Finance Bank, IDFC First Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank shares were up nearly 2 percent each. Heavyweights ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and Axis Bank shares were up more than 1 percent each, while SBI and PNB shares were hovering in the green with marginal gains.

The upbeat tone in the broader market also added to the momentum. At about 10:15 am, the stock was trading at Rs 6.62, higher by 7.7 percent from the last close on the NSE. Despite the day’s uptick, Vodafone Idea remains under pressure — down 21 percent so far in 2025 and having shed nearly 60 percent over the past year. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates The company reported its Q1FY26 numbers after market hours on August 14. Net loss came in at Rs 6,608 crore, wider than the Rs 6,432 crore loss a year ago but an improvement from Rs 7,166 crore reported in the March quarter. Revenue from operations stood at Rs 11,022 crore, up 5 percent year-on-year but flat sequentially. Average revenue per user (ARPU), a key operating metric, improved to Rs 177 against analyst expectations of Rs 167, aided by subscriber upgrades and a better customer mix. Motilal Oswal Financial Services noted that losses were narrower than its estimate of Rs 7,500 crore, helped by lower interest costs, while revenue trends were broadly in line. The brokerage also highlighted that subscriber erosion slowed during the quarter — Vodafone Idea’s user base slipped by just 0.5 million to 197.7 million, a sharp improvement from the 1.6 million decline seen in Q4FY25 and better than its forecast of a 1.2 million drop. Global brokerage UBS retained a Neutral stance on the stock with a target price of Rs 8.5, calling the June quarter performance broadly in line with expectations. It flagged a 0.6 percent quarter-on-quarter improvement in ARPU to Rs 165, stable revenues, and a 1 percent dip in EBITDA, with margins contracting 47 basis points to 41.8 percent. The brokerage also pointed out that the net loss was larger than anticipated, driven by higher interest charges, while capex moderated to Rs 2,440 crore in Q1 from Rs 4,230 crore in Q4 and Rs 3,210 crore in Q3.

It lowered FY26–27 EBITDA estimates by 5–6 percent to factor in the revenue decline from Maharashtra’s tax hike.

"JSPL, SAIL, Tata Steel shares shine after DGTR proposes three-year safeguard duty on key imports",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/steel-stocks-shine-after-dgtr-proposes-three-year-safeguard-duty-on-key-imports-13461459.html,"Shares of leading steel makers Jindal Steel, SAIL, Tata Steel, JSW Steel and JSL are sharply higher in early trade on August 18, after the Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) recommended a three-year safeguard duty on imports of some categories of flat steel products in order to protect the domestic industry from rising imports. The Nifty Metal index is higher by over 1.2 percent in early trade, led by Jindal Steel and SAIL, which are up by close to 2 percent. Once approved by the Finance Ministry, the safeguard duty will kick in at 12 percent in the first year, followed by 11.5 percent in the second year, and 11 percent in the third year. DGTR said the decision is due to a surge in steel imports, especially from China, along with a steep fall in domestic industry profits. A provisional 12 percent duty was already in place, imposed on April 21, 2025, and now, in the final order, DGTR has said that imports have risen 'recently, suddenly, sharply and significantly' between October 2023 to September 2024. This threatens to cause ""serious injury to the domestic industry/producers,"" the DGTR notification said. The current duty of 12 percent was to be in force till the end of September, and the imposition of the latest import levy is being seen as a positive move by the steel industry. The import duty has been recommended by the DGTR in its final report on a probe initiated following a complaint by the Indian Steel Association. The enquiry, initiated in December 2024, ranged across products like hot-rolled and cold-rolled steel, metallic and colour-coated steel. The Alloy Steel Producers Association of India (ASPA), representing players like Tata Steel and JSW Steel, had filed a petition on July 31, claiming that cheap imports from China were adversely affecting the industry. Another association, Indian Stainless Steel Development Association (ISSDA) too had filed an application with the DGTR to investigate the dumping of stainless steel items in the domestic market. However, trade think tank Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) has cautioned against the move to impose duty on Chinese import, stating that it will ""raise input costs, hurt export competitiveness, and squeeze downstream users."" The GTRI argued that the rise in imports was predictable and not 'sudden', and the domestic impact was being overstated. The safeguard duty on steel imports could cripple automotive, engineering, and construction sectors by increasing input costs, GTRI said in its note. GTRI added that more than 250 stakeholders - including automakers and electronics companies had opposed the duty, warning of higher input costs and an impact on export competitiveness. The sentiment in steel stocks was also helped by the announcement by JSW Steel that it is has signed a non-binding agreement South Korea’s POSCO Group to explore setting up a six million tonnes per annum (MTPA) integrated steel plant in India."

Technical View At present, the index is repeatedly facing supply pressure near the 20-DEMA cluster at 24,700–24,800. A sustained close above this area could spark short covering. On the flip side, failure to hold above 24,500 could extend the decline towards the next immediate support at 24,320, which may accelerate selling pressure. The daily RSI remains around 40, showing no strong reversal signal. Overall, the structure favours a sideways bias, with range-bound strategies continuing to hold merit. HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Maruti Suzuki, M&M, and Hero MotoCorp were the top gainers on the Nifty.

"Hero MotoCorp, Maruti Suzuki, M&M rally up to 8% as GST cut buzz lifts auto stocks",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/hero-motocorp-maruti-suzuki-m-m-rally-up-to-8-as-gst-cut-buzz-lifts-auto-stocks-13461215.html,"Shares of automobile makers such as Hero MotoCorp, Maruti Suzuki, Bajaj Auto, M&M and Tata Motors jumped up to 8 percent on Monday, August 18, after reports of a likely GST cut on entry-level two-wheelers, compact cars and hybrids. Hero MotoCorp was the star performer, rallying more than 8 percent to emerge as the top gainer on the Nifty. The move, reported by CNBC-TV18 citing sources, is part of the government’s push towards a two-tier GST regime — an idea highlighted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his Independence Day speech. The rejig, expected by Diwali, seeks to simplify the tax system and ease costs for middle-income households. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Currently, vehicles are taxed under multiple slabs combining GST and cess, depending on engine size, length and ground clearance. The government is now weighing a flat 18 percent levy on mass-market vehicles. This would bring two-wheelers under 350cc, small cars up to 1,200cc, and certain hybrids down sharply from the prevailing 28–31 percent range, while luxury cars and SUVs would continue to attract the top 40 percent bracket. Brokerages see widespread benefits across the auto value chain if the proposal goes through. Morgan Stanley noted that Hero MotoCorp and Eicher Motors stand to gain the most among two-wheelers, with Maruti Suzuki and M&M emerging as key beneficiaries in passenger vehicles. Emkay added that Hero MotoCorp, with a dominant 79 percent share in entry-level two-wheelers, and TVS Motor, which has a 25 percent share in scooters, would be at the forefront of gains. Ancillary suppliers with heavy exposure to two-wheelers, such as Pricol, Sandhar Technologies and ASK Automotive, could also benefit. Motilal Oswal, meanwhile, highlighted that both Maruti Suzuki and Tata Motors, with their passenger vehicles currently in the 28 percent slab, would see significant relief if the GST is brought down to 18 percent. At around 9:20 am, the Nifty Auto index was trading at 24,958, up 3.5 percent, with Maruti Suzuki, M&M, Hero MotoCorp, Bajaj Auto, TVS Motor Company and Tata Motors among the top gainers.

"Can Nifty reclaim 25,000 today? Key levels to track on August 18",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/can-nifty-reclaim-25-000-today-key-levels-to-track-on-august-18-13461085.html,"Benchmark indices Nifty and Sensex are likely to kickstart the session on a strong note on Monday, August 18, as the much-awaited rationalisation of goods and services tax (GST) may come soon, as Prime Minister Modi announced on Independence Day. GST-sensitive stocks such as auto and FMCG will likely be in focus in today's session. At about 8:30 am, the Gift Nifty was trading at 24,989, higher by 1.36 percent of 334 points. On Thursday, the last trading session of the previous week, Indian equity indices ended marginally higher with Nifty above 24,600. For the week, BSE Sensex and Nifty added a percent each, snapping a six-week losing streak. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates FIIs were net sellers of equities worth Rs 1,926 crore on Thursday, while DIIs were net buyers to the tune of Rs 3,895 crore, provisional exchange data showed. Here are the key levels to watch out for in today's session At present, the index is repeatedly facing supply pressure near the 20-DEMA cluster at 24,700–24,800. A sustained close above this area could spark short covering. On the flip side, failure to hold above 24,500 could extend the decline towards the next immediate support at 24,320, which may accelerate selling pressure. The daily RSI remains around 40, showing no strong reversal signal. Overall, the structure favours a sideways bias, with range-bound strategies continuing to hold merit. ""A decisive close above 55,650 or a breach below 54,900 will be essential to escape the current congestion zone. The index closed on a positive note, ending its two-week decline and forming a Bullish Harami on the weekly chart while holding firmly above its 20-WEMA, which sits in the key demand zone of 54,900–55,000. Yet, it remains trapped within the broader 55,700–54,900 corridor — last week’s high and low — which has now emerged as a pivotal zone for the next move. A breakout above resistance could fuel momentum, forcing major call writers to unwind positions and opening the door to a sharper upmove,"" Dhupesh Dhameja of SAMCO Securities said. ""On the downside, a failure to maintain 54,900 support could drag the index towards 54,300, the next immediate support level, potentially accelerating selling pressure,"" he added. India VIX edged up 1.77 percent to settle at 12.35. Despite global headwinds, volatility remains muted, reflecting expectations of consolidation rather than a sharp decline. This indicates caution among market participants but not outright fear. The Nifty Put-Call ratio (PCR), which indicates the mood of the market, fell to 1.01 on August 14, compared to 1.08 in the previous session. The increasing PCR, or being higher than 0.7 or surpassing 1, means traders are selling more Put options than Call options, which generally indicates the firming up of a bullish sentiment in the market.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Eicher Motors, HDFC Life, Manappuram Finance, UNO Minda, Tube Investments, PB Fintech, and others on August 18?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-eicher-motors-hdfc-life-manappuram-finance-uno-minda-tube-investments-pb-fintech-and-others-on-august-18-13460767.html,"The benchmark indices closed flat with a positive bias on August 14, extending their upward journey for the second straight session, but the market breadth was in favour of bears. A total of 1,752 shares saw selling pressure compared to 1,128 shares that advanced on the NSE. The market is expected to remain in consolidation mode until it reclaims all key moving averages. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Osho Krishan, Chief Manager - Technical & Derivative Research at Angel One Manappuram Finance | CMP: Rs 266 Manappuram Finance has demonstrated a robust recovery over the last couple of trading weeks and has now surpassed all major EMAs on the daily chart. The stock has retraced to the neckline of the breakout and has gained traction again, suggesting potential for increased momentum in the short term. The alignment of momentum indicators with the positive crossover among EMAs and a robust increase in trading volumes during the recent period indicates the likelihood of sustained momentum in the foreseeable future. We recommend buying the stock around Rs 264–260. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 294, Rs 300 Stop-Loss: Rs 245 Titan Company | CMP: Rs 3,489.4 Titan Company has seen a decent surge in recent times, followed by consolidation resembling a ‘Double Bottom’ pattern on the daily chart structure. The stock has been hovering slightly above its 20 DEMA, with bullish bias. Additionally, the counter has witnessed a higher low formation on the daily chart and has showcased a positive crossover on technical indicators, adding to the bullish sentiment. The SuperTrend has also turned bullish after the recent surge. From a risk-reward point of view, the counter is firmly aligned with a favourable setup for the short to medium term. Hence, we recommend buying Titan around Rs 3,480–3,460. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,630, Rs 3,680 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,350 UNO Minda | CMP: Rs 1,149.8 UNO Minda has recently experienced a notable spurt in price and volume, characterized by a multi-week breakout. Additionally, the stock has been trading at new highs in the current calendar year, with favourable technical parameters suggesting a bullish bias. From a technical perspective, the MACD indicator has demonstrated a positive crossover around the zero line, contributing to an optimistic outlook for the stock. Hence, we recommend buying UNO Minda around Rs 1,120–1,100. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,250, Rs 1,260 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,040 Jay Mehta, Technical Research at JM Financial Services Tube Investments of India | CMP: Rs 3,063.6 Tube Investments of India, after breaking out from a double bottom pattern, was trading within a wedge formation. Recently, it broke above the wedge and is currently trading above its 20-day and 50-day EMAs, approaching its 200-day EMA. A breakout above the 200-day EMA could further strengthen its bullish momentum. Rising volumes indicate strong buying interest, supporting the bullish outlook. The stock has shown good relative strength and has outperformed the Nifty over the last 6 months. On the daily chart, the RSI stands at 63 with a positive crossover, trending upward, while the rising MACD histogram signals robust momentum. A bullish Marubozu candle on the weekly chart reinforces the strong continuation pattern. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,400, Rs 3,550 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,844 TBO Tek | CMP: Rs 1,444 TBO Tek was trading in a descending triangle pattern since June 30 but recently broke out above it. It has reclaimed its position above the 200-day EMA and is trading above all key short- and long-term moving averages. Volume is gradually increasing on the positive side, indicating growing buying interest. The daily RSI is at 63 and is maintaining its position above 50 levels, showing strong stock strength and suggesting that every small fall is countered with good buying interest. The rising MACD histogram supports continued bullish momentum. The stock exhibits relative strength and has outperformed the Nifty in the past 3 months. The immediate resistance is at Rs 1,508, and a breakout above this level could trigger a significant upward move. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,582, Rs 1,600 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,363 PB Fintech | CMP: Rs 1,834.2 PB Fintech was in a long consolidation phase after a bearish gap-down on January 13. On June 4, it broke above the consolidation pattern, filling the bearish gap between Rs 1,800–1,840. Subsequently, it marked a high of Rs 1,978, then entered a tight wedge consolidation. On August 11, the stock broke out above the wedge with strong volume, signaling robust buying interest. It is trading above all key moving averages, with the daily RSI above 50 and a rising MACD histogram, indicating sustained bullish momentum. The stock has shown good relative strength and has outperformed the Nifty over the last 6 months. The price can test the recent swing high of Rs 1,978, and sustaining above this level could open the path to higher levels. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1978, Rs 2,100, Rs 2,170 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,709 Hardik Matalia, Derivative Analyst at Choice Broking Eicher Motors | CMP: Rs 5,764 Eicher Motors has recently given a breakout from a Symmetric Triangle formation on the daily chart. Prior to this breakout, the stock had undergone a consolidation phase at higher levels, indicating healthy profit booking and base building. The breakout has been supported by consistent trading volumes, reflecting strong participation and growing investor confidence. If the stock manages to sustain above the Rs 5,800 level, it could pave the way for further upside, potentially leading to new lifetime highs. Such price action would confirm the continuation of the prevailing bullish trend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 66.14, trending strongly upwards, highlighting strengthening momentum and buying interest. Additionally, the stock is comfortably holding above all its key moving averages — short-term, medium-term, and long-term EMAs — underlining its strong underlying trend. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 6,350 Stop-Loss: Rs 5,475 HDFC Life Insurance Company | CMP: Rs 788.75 HDFC Life Insurance remains in a long-term uptrend, consistently forming higher highs and higher lows over the past few months. Recently, after hitting a record high, the stock witnessed a healthy retracement toward its demand zone. From this support area, it has staged a reversal, also forming a Double Bottom pattern on the daily timeframe — a classic bullish reversal formation. If the stock manages to sustain above the Rs 800 mark, it could further extend its bullish trajectory and head higher toward the Rs 875 level. Such a move would reinforce the prevailing trend and signal renewed buying momentum. The RSI stands at 65.46 and is trending upwards, highlighting strong positive momentum. Furthermore, the stock has reversed from its demand zone and has reclaimed both its short-term and medium-term EMAs, signaling a revival of buying interest. From a price action standpoint, the formation of a Double Bottom coupled with a rebound from key support levels suggests that buyers are firmly regaining control. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 875 Stop-Loss: Rs 745 State Bank of India | CMP: Rs 826.55 SBI has witnessed a bounce from lower levels after a period of range-bound movement. Recently, the stock has been trading within a parallel channel, indicating a phase of consolidation with defined support and resistance levels. Taking support from the lower boundary of this channel, the stock is now showing early signs of a potential reversal. A sustainable move above the Rs 840 mark could act as confirmation of this reversal, paving the way for further upside in the near term. Such a breakout would signal renewed bullish momentum and open the door for a move toward higher targets. The RSI is at 62.71, trending upwards, indicating improving strength in the underlying trend. Additionally, SBI has taken support from its long-term EMA and has successfully moved above both its short-term and medium-term EMAs, highlighting a strengthening technical structure. From a price action perspective, the channel support and EMA alignment suggest that buyers are gradually regaining control, with the current zone offering a favourable risk-reward setup. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 910 Stop-Loss: Rs 785 Om Mehra, Technical Research Analyst, SAMCO Securities Aditya Birla Capital | CMP: Rs 273 Aditya Birla Capital has rebounded from the 50-day SMA, while the 20-day SMA and the 9-DEMA are providing layered support beneath the current price. The recent candles reflect a higher high formation after the early August low, signalling a steady recovery. The RSI has improved to 55 from the neutral zone, indicating strengthening momentum. The MACD has crossed above the zero line, with the histogram turning positive, supporting the emerging bullish tone. There has been a decent rise in delivery-based participation, highlighting that the trend continuation is likely to remain intact. The price is now positioned above multiple moving averages, creating a strong base for a short-term pullback. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 286 Stop-Loss: Rs 266 Endurance Technologies | CMP: Rs 2,602.20 Endurance Technologies has moved above the mid-Bollinger band, signalling the early stages of a recovery phase after consolidation. The stock displays a higher lows formation, with multiple moving average supports clustering near the Rs 2,550–2,570 zone. The RSI has improved to 52 from the mid-40 levels, indicating a pickup in momentum. The MACD is turning higher toward a potential bullish crossover, and the histogram is printing green bars. The weekly candle has a follow-up green close, hinting at the potential for expansion on the higher side. A notable rise in volumes on up-days further validates accumulation at current levels.

On the broader indices front, BSE mid and smallcap indices snapped the 3-week losing streak, while largecap indices also broke the 6-week losing streak following positive data points from the US and India, including CPI data, inline earnings, rupee appreciation, and falling oil prices.

For the week, the BSE Sensex index added 739.87 points or 0.92 percent to close at 80,597.66, and Nifty50 rose 268 points or 1.10 percent to end at 24,631.30.

On the other hand, Nifty Consumer Durables and FMCG indices shed 0.5 percent each. ""In the last truncated week, the benchmark indices witnessed a pullback rally. The Nifty ended up by 1.1 percent, whereas the Sensex gained 748 points. Among sectors, almost all the major sectoral indices traded in positive territory, but the Pharma and Healthcare indices outperformed, both rallied over 3 percent. Meanwhile, profit booking was seen in selective FMCG and Consumer stocks,"" said Amol Athawale, VP Technical Research, Kotak Securities. ""Technically, on daily and intraday charts, the market has formed reversal patterns, which are largely positive. Additionally, a bullish candle was formed on the weekly charts, indicating the continuation of the pullback in the near future."" ""We believe that 24,500/80300 will act as a key support zone for short-term traders. As long as the market trades above this level, the bullish sentiment is likely to continue. On the higher side, 24,700/80900 would be the immediate resistance zone for the bulls. A successful breakout above 24,700/80900 could push the market towards 24,900-25,000/81500-81800,"" he said. ""However, below 24,500/80300, market sentiment could turn negative. The index could then retest levels around 24,350/79800. Further downside may also continue, potentially dragging the index to 24,200-24,150/79300-79100,"" Athawale added further. The BSE Small-cap index ended with o.4 percent gain, led by Yatra Online with a 55 percent gain, following HBL Engineering, NMDC Steel, JM Financial, Rico Auto, EIH, and VST Tillers Tractors. However, major losers losers PG Electroplast, NIBE, Camlin Fine Sciences, Best Agrolife, Marksans Pharma, and Action Construction Equipment. Where is Nifty50 headed? Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities Technically, the market action signals range-bound action and awaits a geopolitical event during the long weekend. Nifty on the weekly chart formed a reasonable positive candle that reversed the previous six losing weeks. Placement of cluster supports around 24300-24200 levels could offer strong support on any weakness from here. However, a sustainable upmove above the hurdle of 24700 could open further upside towards the 25,000 mark in the near term. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The overall sentiment is likely to favour bullish trades as long as the index holds above 24,337. On the higher side, resistance is placed at 24,660 and 24,850, while a fall below 24,337 could trigger a resumption of the bearish trend. Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking The prevailing consolidation suggests that markets have largely digested recent negatives and are now awaiting a trigger for recovery. Additionally, oversold positions in heavyweights across sectors are further supporting this possibility. Going forward, a decisive break above 24,800 on the Nifty could spark fresh momentum; otherwise, consolidation may persist. Participants should maintain a stock-specific trading approach with a focus on risk management.
