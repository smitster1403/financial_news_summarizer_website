The open offer reflects an internal transfer between Blackstone-managed funds (from BCP VII/Asia to BCP IX/Asia II), triggering a mandatory offer under Sebi regulations as they are not part of the same promoter group. This open offer will result in a continuation of Blackstone’s investment into a new fund structure, rather than an exit from the company. ""...BCP Topco VII Pte. Ltd. (“Seller”) (the promoter of Aadhar Housing Finance Limited (“Target Company”)) has entered into a share purchase agreement with BCP Asia II Holdco VII Pte. Ltd. (“Acquirer”) today i.e., 25 July 2025 (“SPA”), pursuant to which the Acquirer has agreed to acquire from the Seller up to 28,20,52,121 equity shares of the Target Company representing 64.14% of its Expanded Voting Share Capital (as defined below) at a price not exceeding Rs. 425.00 per equity share,"" the company filing said. Why The Open Offer The acquirer - BCP IX/Asia II Fund - and the seller belong to separate funds, though under the Blackstone umbrella. The Seller is a part of Blackstone Capital Partners VII fund (BCP VII) and Blackstone Capital Partners Asia fund (BCP Asia), while the acquirer is a part of Blackstone Capital Partners IX fund (BCP IX) and Blackstone Capital Partners Asia II fund (BCP Asia II). Each of these funds are managed or advised by separate affiliates of Blackstone Inc, hence the economic ownership of the seller and the acquirer lies with diversified passive partners of the relevant funds. Given the separate entities, the exemption from open offer does not apply and, accordingly, the acquirer is making this open offer. The open offer price reflects a premium to the Rs 425 per share internal transfer price, and offers liquidity to public holders. The transaction will be considered complete after the approval from RBI, National Housing Bank and CCI. June Quarter Results The company reported results over the weekend, posting a NII growth of 21.6 percent on year at Rs 428 crore along with a net profit of Rs 237 crore, which is higher by 18.6% on year. The gross non-performing assets rose marginally to 1.34 percent during June after compared to 1.31 percent of AUM a year ago. The Asset Under Management (AUM) grew by 26 percent to Rs 26,524 crore during Q1FY26. The HFC's disbursements were healthy at Rs 1,979 crore, higher by 32 percent YoY on affordable housing demand, MD and CEO Rishi Anand said. Brokerage Citi has opened a 90-day positive catalyst watch on Aadhar Housing Finance, adding to the sentiment."

Wockhardt shares rally over 5 percent after Zaynich used to treat pan-drug resistant infection,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/wockhardt-shares-rally-over-5-percent-after-zaynich-used-to-treat-pan-drug-resistant-infection-13335752.html,"Shares of Wockhardt were sharply higher by over 5 percent on July 28 after the drug company issued a statement citing a medical case involving the use of Zaynich - its novel antibiotic - in treating a critically ill US liver transplant patient who was suffering from a pan-drug resistant infection. Wockhardt shared the details of a successful use of Zaynich in treating an infection resistant to all available antibiotics in America. The case study was published in the latest issue of the Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy – AMR, a leading publication by the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, and jointly authored by US clinicians from leading hospitals - Houston Methodist Hospital, Weill Cornell Medical College and Johns Hopkins. The patient was infected with two different pathogens, both resistant to all recently-introduced antibiotics, leading to pan-drug resistance. ""Initially, the patient was treated for 10 weeks with cefiderocol and eravacycline (a novel tetracycline antibiotic), but the infection persisted, and the Pseudomonas strain became resistant to cefiderocol. The patient continued to suffer from fever and chills, and imaging tests showed new abscesses in the liver — clear signs that the infection was not under control,"" the company filing informed. Subsequently, an emergency access to Zaynich was sought, that led to encouraring results. ""The antibiotic was administered for 14 days around the time of the liver transplant. The results were remarkable - within 11 days, the patient improved clinically and transferred from ICU to regular floor, and follow-up imaging showed no signs of active infection,"" Wockhardt added. Given the risk of transplant failure due to multi-drug resistant infections, an emergency access to Zaynich was sought, and the antibiotic was administered for 14 days around the time of the liver transplant, which helped the patient recover. ""The results were remarkable - within 11 days, the patient improved clinically and transferred from ICU to regular floor, and follow-up imaging showed no signs of active infection. Importantly, the patient remained infection-free even after six weeks of completing treatment with Zaynich, making liver transplant successful and allowing doctors to safely resume chemotherapy for the underlying cancer,"" Wockhardt said."

"Bajaj Finserv shares rise 2% after Q1 net profit jumps 30% to Rs 2,789 crore: Should you buy, sell or hold?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/bajaj-finserv-shares-rise-2-after-q1-net-profit-jumps-30-to-rs-2-789-crore-should-you-buy-sell-or-hold-13335431.html,"The shares of Bajaj Finserv jumped nearly 2 percent in morning trade on July 28 after the company released its results for the first quarter of the financial year 2026. Brokerages remained bullish on the stock, with target prices implying strong upside potential. The shares of the non-banking financial company (NBFC) were trading at Rs 2,018 apiece, as seen at 9.30 am. Bajaj Finserv Q1 Results: Bajaj Finserv on July 25 (Friday) had reported a net profit of Rs 2,789 crore for Q1 FY26. This marked a 30.5 percent rise from the Rs 2,138 crore net profit reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year. The company's revenue from operations stood at Rs 35,439.08 crore in the quarter under review, marking a year-on-year (YoY) jump of 12.5 percent from Rs 31,479.93 crore reported in the corresponding quarter of previous year. On a sequential basis, the profit after tax (PAT) surged 15 percent from Rs 2,416.64 crore reported by the company in Q4 FY25. However, the revenue declined 3 percent from Rs 36,595.36 crore in the January-March quarter. Should you buy, sell or hold? JM Financial kept a ‘Buy’ call on the stock, but raised its target price to Rs 2,300 apiece (earlier Rs 2,250 apiece). The latest target price implies an upside potential of nearly 16 percent from the stock’s previous closing price of Rs 1,985.80 apiece. The domestic brokerage said that it expects the company to return to steady growth by the second half of this year. It added that it appreciates the firm’s reset in product and cost structures. “At CMP, while the implied holdco discount of 17% is less than 5 year average of 21%, we prefer Bajaj Finserv over Bajaj Finance to play the Bajaj growth story,” it added. HDFC Securities also maintained a ‘Buy’ call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 2,430 apiece. This implies an upside potential of more than 22 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. The domestic brokerage noted that the firm’s Q1 FY26 performance was strong across all operating business. “With the NBFC business maintaining sector leadership, the improving trajectory in insurance is expected to drive an operational turnaround and a 500bps increase in SOTP contribution, supporting a re-rating,” HDFC Securities said. Bajaj Finserv share price history: Notably, the shares of the company had closed over 2 percent lower on July 25 after the company had released its results for the first quarter of the financial year 2026. The stock has gained nearly 14 percent in the past six months, and is up more than 27 percent in 2025 so far.

"Tata Motors, Samvardhana, Bharat Forge rise up to 2% on US-European Union trade deal",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/tata-motors-samvardhana-bharat-forge-rise-up-to-2-on-us-european-union-trade-deal-13335396.html,"Shares of Tata Motors, Samvardhana Motherson, Sona BLW, and Bharat Forge gained up to 2 percent each on July 28 as investors cheered a sweeping US-European Union trade deal that is expected to lower tariff barriers and boost automotive exports. The US on Sunday evening unveiled a landmark trade agreement with the EU that standardises tariffs across most product categories at 15 percent. The move marks a significant shift from the existing 27.5 percent duty on car imports from the EU and comes just days ahead of President Donald Trump’s August 1 tariff deadline. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates The deal, which follows a similar agreement with Japan last week, is expected to ease trade frictions and could offer a competitive edge to several Indian companies with deep linkages to the US and EU auto ecosystems. Tata Motors rose 1.6 percent as analysts flagged potential benefits to Jaguar Land Rover, which exports a substantial portion of its US-bound vehicles from Slovakia, an EU member. The reduced tariff rate is likely to offer cost advantages, especially with nearly a third of JLR’s volumes headed to the US. Shares of Samvardhana Motherson climbed 1.3 percent. The company supplies components to OEMs in Germany and Mexico that cater to the US market, which accounts for roughly 6 to 7 percent of its consolidated revenue. The easing of tariffs could translate into smoother trade flows and potentially higher volumes. Also read: Not cutting jobs because of AI, says TCS CEO Krithivasan on 2% workforce layoff plans Sona BLW advanced 1.3 percent on the day. With 43 percent of its revenue coming from the US, the company stands to gain meaningfully from a more predictable and favourable tariff regime. Bharat Forge gained 1 percent, buoyed by the prospect of stronger export momentum. The US accounts for 35 to 40 percent of its standalone exports, and a friendlier trade environment could drive incremental demand for its products. At about 9:45 am, Nifty Auto was trading at 23,898, higher by 0.5 percent from the last close on the NSE. Nifty Auto has gained over 7 percent in the last 6 months.

While a truce has been reached between the US-EU and the US-Japan, a deal with India is taking longer than initially anticipated. At open, Kotak Mahindra Bank and TCS led the losses. At about 9:30 am, the Sensex was down 209.79 points or 0.26 percent at 81,253.30, and the Nifty was down 48.70 points or 0.20 percent at 24,788.30.

""Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) pulled out Rs 13,552 crore from the cash market last week, further dragging sentiment. Meanwhile, Q1 earnings so far have lacked any meaningful upside surprises, reinforcing the cautious mood,"" he added. At market open on July 28, sectoral trends were mixed across the NSE indices. The Nifty IT index led the laggards, slipping 1.03 percent, weighed down by weak sentiment in large-cap tech stocks. Private banks also came under pressure, with the Nifty Private Bank index down 0.92 percent, while the broader Nifty Bank declined 0.23 percent. On the other hand, Nifty Auto edged up 0.40 percent, showing early strength, while PSU Bank and Oil & Gas indices were marginally in the green, up 0.26 percent and 0.25 percent, respectively.

Jefferies, aling with other brokerages, noted that the plan to trim the workforce might lead to near-term execution slippages and higher long-term attrition. Going ahead, cost optimisation and AI-led productivity will drive most deal wins, and firms that are unable to gain market-share will have to resort to layoffs. Shares of Shriram Finance rose 1 percent after the company posted a strong set of numbers for the first quarter of FY26. Standalone net profit rose 9 percent year-on-year to Rs 2,156 crore, while net interest income (NII) grew 12.6 percent to Rs 6,026 crore. HSBC, Jefferies, Nuvama, and Motilal Oswal have given bullish ratings on the stock. Shares of private lender Kotak Mahindra slipped 7 percent after the bank's net profit took a 7 percent tumble. Kotak Mahindra Bank reported a standalone net profit of Rs 3,282 crore for Q1 FY26, marking a 7 percent year-on-year decline from Rs 3,520 crore in the same period last year. Going ahead, international brokerage Bernstein believes that the surge in credit costs and soft asset quality will continue to weigh on Kotak Mahindra Bank’s valuation.

The tone for early next week remains negative as put writers are likely to continue repositioning at lower levels. Index has convincingly slipped below its 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), currently placed at 24,950, which had previously offered strong support. This level will now act as immediate resistance. A sustained close below 24,800 could further accelerate the selling momentum, dragging the index toward the 24,600–24,500 zone. Tata Motors, Shriram Finance, Bajaj Finserv, Hero MotoCorp, and Maruti Suzuki were the top gainers on the Nifty. Laggards on the index included Kotak Mahindra Bank, TCS, Bharti Airtel, Titan Company, and Jio Financial Services.

Standalone net profit rose 9 percent year-on-year to Rs 2,156 crore, while net interest income (NII) grew 12.6 percent to Rs 6,026 crore. Shriram Finance’s total assets under management (AUM) rose 17 percent year-on-year to Rs 2,72,249 crore. On a sequential basis, AUM grew from Rs 2,63,190 crore reported at the end of March 2025. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Should you buy, sell, or hold the stock? HSBC remains positive on Shriram Finance with a ‘Buy’ rating and a target price of Rs 730. This implies an upside potential of nearly 20 percent from the last close. The brokerage acknowledged the rise in gross Stage‑2 loans—up 6–9 percent quarter-on-quarter for consecutive quarters—but noted that the management has maintained its credit cost guidance. While AUM growth remains on track, HSBC pointed out that higher liquidity is exerting pressure on net interest margins, estimating a 30–35 basis point drag. It cut EPS estimates for FY26–27 by 2–4 percent but maintained its positive stance, citing recovery prospects in the second half of FY26. Jefferies has also maintained a ‘Buy’ rating on Shriram Finance, with a target price of Rs 800. The brokerage highlighted a 17 percent year-on-year AUM growth, which was in line with expectations. NIMs improved sequentially but fell slightly short of estimates due to liquidity-related drag. On the asset quality front, gross Stage 3 loans declined quarter-on-quarter, and credit costs came in better than expected. Stage 2 and 3 assets together rose slightly to 11.8 percent from 11.4 percent. Jefferies expects a 16 percent AUM CAGR, NIM improvement, 19 percent EPS CAGR, and 16 percent ROE over FY25–28. Also read: Apple suppliers flock to Tamil Nadu: Rs 30,000-crore boost to iPhone supply chain Motilal Oswal has reiterated a ‘Buy’ rating on Shriram Finance with a target price of Rs 780, calling it their Top Idea in the NBFC space. The brokerage noted that demand in rural and semi-urban regions remains strong, with segments like used commercial vehicles (CVs) and MSME lending showing resilience and no major stress. Shriram Finance is well-positioned to capitalise on its diversified AUM mix, improved liability access, and growing cross-selling opportunities. Motilal also highlighted that the company is yet to fully tap into its wide distribution network for non-vehicle products, presenting further growth potential. Nuvama has maintained a ‘Buy’ rating on Shriram Finance with a target price of Rs 710, citing an improved performance in the June quarter following a muted Q4FY25. NIM is expected to improve to 8.5 percent by Q4FY26, supported by the normalisation of excess liquidity and easing deposit rates. The company has guided for a return on assets (RoA) of over 3 percent for FY26, with credit costs expected to hover around 2 percent of total assets. Shriram Finance shares have declined by nearly 10 percent over the past month.

Here are the key levels to watch out for in today’s session After a prolonged period of sideways movement, this close below the 25,000 level reinforces the dominance of bears and suggests limited upside potential in the near term. The tone for early next week remains negative as put writers are likely to continue repositioning at lower levels. Index has convincingly slipped below its 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), currently placed at 24,950, which had previously offered strong support. This level will now act as immediate resistance. A sustained close below 24,800 could further accelerate the selling momentum, dragging the index toward the 24,600–24,500 zone. “From a technical standpoint, the Bank Nifty index closed below its 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) situated at 56,800, a level that previously acted as a crucial cushion. Post breakdown, this level will now serve as the immediate resistance”, Dhupesh Dhameja of SAMCO Securities said. “A continued move below the 56,500 mark may intensify bearish momentum and potentially trigger a slide towards the 56,100–56,000 support band. With resistances gradually shifting lower, the earlier support zone of 57,000–56,800 has now turned into a supply zone”, he added. India VIX rose 5.15 percent, closing at 11.27. Despite the uptick, the index remains well below the 13 mark, indicating a lack of panic and confirming that current selling is methodical rather than fear-driven. The low volatility environment suggests that while intraday declines persist, long-term investors are not yet exiting in a hurry. The Put-Call Ratio (PCR) declined from 0.76 to 0.58, underscoring increased call writing activity and a tilt in favour of bears. This realignment of positions by both call and put writers reflects a defensive and cautious undertone in the market.

"Kotak Mahindra Bank shares sink 7% on muted Q1 show; should you buy, sell, or hold?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/kotak-mahindra-bank-shares-in-focus-as-net-profit-slips-7-yoy-should-you-buy-sell-or-hold-13334903.html,"Shares of private lender Kotak Mahindra Bank cracked over seven percent in trade on Monday, July 28, following the bank's earnings show for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, wherein net profit took a seven percent tumble. Kotak Mahindra Bank reported a standalone net profit of Rs 3,282 crore for Q1 FY26, marking a 7 percent year-on-year decline from Rs 3,520 crore in the same period last year. This figure is after adjusting for a one-time gain from the sale of its general insurance business. Including the gain, the unadjusted net profit stood significantly higher at Rs 6,250 crore. The drop in profit was mainly due to a sharp rise in provisioning and contingencies, which surged 109 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,208 crore. Net interest income (NII) rose 6 percent to Rs 7,259 crore, while the net interest margin (NIM) remained strong at 4.65 percent. Further, Kotak Mahindra Bank delivered higher credit growth at 14 percent YoY, with heavy lifting done by the low-yielding corporate book. This, coupled with lending rate cuts, led to a steep 32 bps QoQ margin contraction to 4.7 percent. The management expects margin pressure to persist in Q2 as full impact of the 50 bps repo rate cut sinks in, albeit to gradually stabilize and improve thereafter, as cost reduction (including SA cost) flows through. Asset quality too deteriorated, with slippages jumping to 1.9 percent due to stress inMFI, retail CV, and KCC loans.

Nomura has maintained a 'neutral' rating on Kotak Mahindra Bank with a target price of Rs 2,150 per share. The brokerage has cut its FY26–28 earnings per share estimates by 3–7 percent, citing asset quality concerns and margin pressure. Nomura noted that the core bank trades at approximately 1.9× FY27 book value per share, indicating limited upside. Morgan Stanley maintained an 'overweight' rating on Kotak Bank, with a target price of Rs 2,600 per share. The brokerage said that bank’s growth outpaced the industry, but was disappointed by the decline in NIMs and elevated formation of non-performing loans. Q2 to remain challenging due to further margin compression, but sees earnings accelerating thereafter. ""Management expects NIM to bottom out by Q2FY26, supported by the full transmission of rate cuts, deposit repricing, and CRR benefits, with a recovery likely from H2. Growth in the unsecured segment is expected to pick up gradually as the lending environment improves, aiding both growth and margin trajectory,"" said Motilal Oswal. The brokerage cut its target price on the firm to Rs 2,400 per share, while keep its 'buy' tag intact.

"Raamdeo Agrawal bets big on digital platforms; some will fail but growth potential unprecedented, he says",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/raamdeo-agrawal-bets-big-on-digital-platforms-some-will-fail-but-growth-potential-unprecedented-he-says-13334779.html,"Many internet-first businesses will come to the markets and spread like fire, says Raamdeo Agrawal, chairman and co-founder, Motilal Oswal Financial Services. The pace at which these companies are growing is unprecedented even though many platforms are yet to be listed. Some will fail too but those that click will grow significantly, says the market veteran. “Internet (digital businesses) will come to the market and spread like fire. While we have a few digital companies that are listed, there are many firms that are yet to come to the market,” said Agrawal while speaking at an event organized by Motilal Oswal Wealth Management. “Some will fail too but those that click will actually show a strong growth over many years. This is because internet-based companies grow and scale at a very quick pace,” added the market veteran. Interestingly, Agrawal also touched upon the massive recent surge in the valuation of Nvidia to become the world’s largest listed company. He said that while India may not have a semiconductor giant like Nvidia, we will have our own versions of companies in the digital space that will have the potential to become big and become multi-baggers for the investor community. “There is no caste or creed in the market. There is only earnings and earnings growth. When we say that our economy will double in size in the coming years then we will definitely see many more new companies coming to the market and some of those will become huge along with the economic growth,” said Agrawal. On a different context, Agrawal said that the Indian capital market is becoming deeper with more participation from various categories of investors, especially retail. “Participating in the Indian market is increasing. Earlier, promoters used to own a majority of the market. Now that share is reducing and retail share is increasing. This is a big trend and will continue,” explained Agrawal. He, however, cautioned that while huge money has been coming to the markets in the last few years, there has been no big change in the earnings. “Markets will see correction but investor should not be scared. Investors should not do anything that they do not understand. Keep it simple,” he said.

A total of 2,179 shares were under pressure, compared to just 475 advancing shares on the NSE. The market is expected to consolidate further as long as the frontline indices continue trading below their medium-term moving averages. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Rajesh Palviya, Senior Vice President Research (Head Technical Derivatives) at Axis Securities Cipla | CMP: Rs 1,532.5 With Friday's strong gains, Cipla decisively surpassed its ten-month down-sloping trendline resistance at Rs 1,516 on a closing basis. This breakout was accompanied by strong volumes, indicating increased participation. Buying momentum emerged near the 20, 50, 100, and 200-day simple moving averages (Rs 1,490), which now act as a crucial support zone. The daily and weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates rising strength, while a daily Bollinger Bands buy signal suggests increased momentum. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,600, Rs 1,685 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,490 Eternal | CMP: Rs 310.55 On the weekly chart, Zomato’s parent company Eternal decisively broke above the multiple resistance zone of Rs 300–305 on a closing basis, signaling a sustained uptrend. Surging volumes confirm increased market participation. The stock is trading well above its 20, 50, 100, and 200-day SMAs, reaffirming the bullish trend. These moving averages are also trending higher in line with the price rise, which further confirms bullish sentiment. The daily and weekly Bollinger Bands buy signal indicates strengthening momentum, while the RSI across daily, weekly, and monthly timeframes continues to rise. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 350, Rs 410 Stop-Loss: Rs 300 Rajesh Bhosale, Technical Analyst at Angel One Shyam Metalics and Energy | CMP: Rs 969 Since September last year, Shyam Metalics had faced strong resistance around the Rs 950 mark. However, a clear consolidation breakout is now visible on the daily chart, indicating a shift in momentum. The stock has entered uncharted territory, reflecting inherent strength despite broader market weakness. This breakout is supported by robust volumes, and the smoothed RSI has given a fresh bullish crossover, reinforcing the positive outlook. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,070 Stop-Loss: Rs 915 Torrent Pharmaceuticals | CMP: Rs 3,603.8 During the week, the pharma sector showcased its defensive strength by outperforming the broader market. Torrent Pharma stood out with a remarkable upmove, with every minor dip being swiftly bought into. The stock broke above its August 2024 swing highs, entering uncharted territory and confirming a strong consolidation breakout. The move was accompanied by a strong bullish candle. With momentum oscillators firmly in positive territory, the uptrend is expected to continue in the near term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,800 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,500 Anshul Jain, Head of Research at Lakshmishree Hubtown | CMP: Rs 315.75 Hubtown has broken out of a 156-day-long Cup and Handle pattern at Rs 310, backed by strong relative volume — a clear indication of institutional participation. This validates the strength of the breakout. Momentum indicators and moving averages are well-aligned, supporting the bullish setup. The presence of high volume near the neckline adds to market confidence, suggesting a sustained upmove. The stock appears poised for continued strength in the near to medium term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 390 Stop-Loss: Rs 285 Vimta Labs | CMP: Rs 585 Vimta Labs is on the verge of a bullish breakout from a rectangle box pattern, with the breakout level placed around Rs 590. The last two candles in the base have shown an explosive surge in volume — over 4,000 percent above the 50-day average — clearly pointing to institutional interest. This volume buildup, combined with aligned momentum indicators, signals strong potential for a sustained breakout. A decisive move above Rs 590 will confirm the breakout, with a likely initial target of Rs 700. The combination of chart structure, volume, and momentum indicates a high-probability trade setup favouring the bulls. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 700 Stop-Loss: Rs 530 JSW Infrastructure | CMP: Rs 314.5 After a sharp 50 percent rally in just 22 days (February - April 2025), JSW Infrastructure is currently consolidating in a bullish Volatility Contraction Pattern (VCP) on the daily charts. The volume structure is textbook — expanding on up days and contracting on down days — suggesting institutional accumulation. Momentum indicators are beginning to turn higher, pointing toward an imminent breakout. A decisive close above Rs 330 will confirm the breakout, paving the way for a move to fresh all-time highs. Post-breakout, the stock has the potential to rally towards the Rs 390 zone in the short to medium term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 360, Rs 390 Stop-Loss: Rs 298 Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

For the week, the BSE Sensex index fell 294.64 points or 0.36 percent to finish at 81463.09, and Nifty50 declined 131.4 points or 0.52 percent to close at 24837. However, in this month till now Sensex and Nifty shed 2.5 percent each. The Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) remained net sellers throughout the week, while Domestic Institutional Investors (DII) compensated with buying the equities. FIIs extended their selling in fourth week, as they sold equities worth Rs 13,552.91 crore, however, DII bought equities worth Rs 17,932.45 crore, extending buying in 14th week. In this month till now, FII sold equities worth Rs 30,508.66 crore, while DII bought equities worth Rs 39,825.97crore. On the sectoral, Nifty Media index shed 5.7 percent, Nifty Realty index declined nearly 5 percent, Nifty IT index plunged 4 percent, Nifty oil & gas and FMCG shed 3.5 percent each. However, Nifty Bank, Pharma and Private Bank indices ended with marginal gains. ""The Indian equity market ended lower for the fourth consecutive week, as weak Q1 earnings and cautious global sentiment weighed on investor confidence. The Nifty 50 breached the key level of 24,900, along with the significant FII’s net short positions reflect broad-based selling pressure,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments. ""Mid- & small-cap indices saw steeper corrections, underperforming the benchmark. The sectoral laggards, including IT and financials, were adversely impacted by subdued guidance and emerging concerns around asset quality. Subpar aggregate earnings performance is likely to challenge the sustainability of current premium valuations across benchmark indices, and we expect a consolidation in the near term."" ""The finalization of the US-Japan and India-UK trade agreements marks a key step in easing global trade barriers. A resolution of the US–India mini trade deal by 1 August could further allay investor concerns. Domestically, the expectation for further rate cuts is also rising on the back of a benign inflationary trend, which will stimulate growth."" ""The ECB has paused monetary policy easing cycles amid concerns over global inflationary pressures from potential tariff implementations. Going forward, the market will be keeping a close eye on key US data such as GDP and jobs data next week, which will influence the Fed's interest rate decision, with the market expecting the Fed to maintain the status quo,"" Nair added further. The BSE Small-cap index plunged 2.5 percent with Indian Energy Exchange, Blue Jet Healthcare, Control Print, Wendt (India), KSolves India, Ion Exchange (India), Ceat, Veranda Learning Solutions, Kirloskar Pneumatic Company, Quick Heal Technologies, Transrail Lighting, PC Jeweller, Ideaforge Technology, Cigniti Technologies falling between 10-34 percent. On the other hand, InfoBeans Technologies, KIOCL, Tilaknagar Industries, Master Trust, SML Isuzu added between 20-40 percent. Where is Nifty50 headed? Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Research, Wealth Management, Motilal Oswal Financial Services We expect market to remain in consolidation mode amid continued uncertainty around India-US trade deal, a mixed Q1FY26 earnings season so far and intensifying FII outflows. Key results over the weekend include Kotak Mahindra bank, Macrotech Developers, CDSL amongst others. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities Nifty remained under sustained selling pressure as the index slipped below the crucial support level of 24,900. Moreover, it has closed below the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (50EMA) for the first time in several sessions, signaling a meaningful weakening of the ongoing trend. Additionally, the index has now fallen back into the zone of the previous swing high on the daily timeframe, which further highlights a potential trend reversal. The current setup appears notably weak and suggests the possibility of a deeper correction. If the Nifty fails to reclaim levels above 24,900 in the next session or two, bulls could face significant short-term challenges. On the downside, immediate support is seen at 24,700, followed by 24,500. On the upside, resistance is now placed around 25,000. Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities The equity markets in India and globally focused on earnings and management commentary during the Q1FY26 earnings season. While aggregate earnings were broadly in line with estimates, the muted outlook provided by a number of companies across sectors dented the market mood. Crude oil price remains range-bound and continues to provide comfort. Further, a good monsoon so far and low inflation numbers are further positive for India. However, uncertainty with trade tariffs continues to impact global and domestic equity market sentiments. Over the next couple of weeks, stock-specific action will continue, led by the Q1FY26 result outcome and management commentary.

"Goodyear launches sale process for Indian arm’s farm tyre business, engages Citi",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/goodyear-launches-sale-process-for-indian-arm-s-farm-tyre-business-engages-citi-13325907.html,"The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co, USA, parent company of India-listed Goodyear India, has put the latter’s farm tyre business on the block and launched the sale process, multiple industry sources in the know told Moneycontrol on the condition of anonymity. The move follows an announcement in April that the Akron, Ohio-based global tyre giant had sought to conduct a review of the vertical. “The deal was launched earlier this week and there is strong interest in the market for the division which has a hefty market share. Primarily strategic suitors have been tapped but there may also be a play for private equity funds who could explore tie-ups with smaller players. The segment has seen successful exits by PE fund in the past,” said one of the persons. In 2016, private equity firm KKR sold its 90 per cent stake in Alliance Tire group to Japan’s Yokohama Rubber for $1.2 billion. Back then, the deal was one of the largest PE exits for an India-related business. According to a second person familiar with the process, investment bank Citi has been engaged as the sell-side advisor and the valuation expectation is around $300 million. In response to an email query from Moneycontrol, on April 21, 2025, The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co, USA, said, “Goodyear informed the India Stock Exchange that the company has placed its farm tire business in India under strategic review. This strategic review is proceeding as planned.” An email query to Goodyear India was left unanswered at the time of publishing this article. When contacted, Citi declined to comment. On April 21, post a board meeting, the Board of Goodyear India disclosed that it had taken note of the communication “received from The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., USA, i.e. the ultimate parent company regarding their intention to conduct a review of the farm tire business of the Company to evaluate all strategic, operational and financial opportunities related to that business.” At the end of day’s trade on July 24, the market cap of Goodyear India stood at Rs 2260.52 crore, with 74 per cent stake with promoter entity ‘Goodyear Orient Company’. For FY24-25, Goodyear India registered a revenue of Rs 2,608 crore and net profit of Rs 55 crore, as per exchange data. In late 2023, Goodyear announced a transformation plan called ""Goodyear Forward"", targeting approximately $2 billion in proceeds through portfolio optimization and $1 billion in cost savings by the end of 2025. The plan included strategic alternatives for its assets like its chemicals business, the Dunlop brand (later sold to Japan’s Sumitomo for $700 million), and off-the-road tire business. The top five listed players in India by net profit in the tyre and rubber products segment include MRF, Balkrishna Industries, Apollo Tyres, CEAT and JK Tyres. Birla Tyres, City Cat Tyres, Ascenso Tyres, Hindustan Tyre Co, TVS Srichakra , Ralco Tyres, Immortal Tyres and Poddar Tyres are some other players. Key global brands include Michelin, Bridgestone and Continental Tires. Incidentally, as part of a strategic realignment, Continental Tires recently shut its truck and bus radial tire business in India due to cost pressures and is now focused solely on the passenger and light truck segment. In recent M&A news in the sector, CEAT - an RPG company - and Michelin, a global tyre company, announced on December 6, 2024 a definitive agreement for CEAT to acquire Camso brand’s Off-Highway construction equipment, bias tyre and tracks business from Michelin in an all-cash deal valued at about $225 million. Lens on Goodyear India Goodyear India manufactures and sells farm and commercial truck bias tyres at its Ballabgarh plant. The company also markets and sells passenger car tyres which are manufactured by Goodyear South Asia Tyres Private Limited, Aurangabad, in the replacement market. Other products which the company markets and sells include tubes and flaps. In its last annual report, the firm had highlighted the difficulties in the farm tyre segment. “The Indian farm tire industry faced a series of challenges, including rising raw material costs, supply chain disruptions, and external pressures such as fuel price volatility and weak agricultural income. These factors contributed to slower growth and reduced demand for farm tires in certain segments of the market. However, despite these challenges, the industry showed resilience and registered growth of 3.8% in the Financial Year 2024-25 on Y-o-Y basis.” Goodyear India elaborated “The Farm OE has seen a growth of 4 percent in the financial year 2024-25 on Y-o-Y basis. Financial Year 2025-26 looks positive, with continued growth in farm mechanization, supported by government initiatives and advancements in technology. However, challenges such as the affordability of equipment for smaller farmers and climate uncertainties remain. OEMs that focus on sustainability, innovation, and accessibility are well-positioned to capture the growing demand for farm machinery in India.”"

Sunjay Kapur's mother alleges 'coercion' after son's 'suspicious' death: 'Compelled to sign documents…',https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sunjay-kapur-s-mother-asks-sona-blw-to-defer-agm-alleges-coercion-after-son-s-suspicious-death-13325584.html,"Rani Kapur, the mother of Sona Comstar's late Chairman Sunjay Kapur has written a letter to the company's board, seeking immediate deferment of the company's annual general meeting (AGM) which is scheduled for July 25. She raised strong objections to the AGM being held at a time of deep mourning for the family, amid the 'suspicious' and sudden death of her son. Sunjay Kapur had passed away at the age of 53 on June 12 after suffering a heart attack in UK. The incident occurred while he was playing polo. Notably, the AGM has already begun with Sunjay Kapur's widow Priya Sachdev likely to attend the meeting, reports said. In her letter, Rani Kapur noted that she is the sole beneficiary of her late husband Surinder Kapur's estate, and the majority shareholder of the Sona Group including Sona Comstar. ""As you are aware, on 12.06.2025, my son Mr. Sunjay Kapur tragically passed away under highly suspicious and unexplained circumstances in the United Kingdom. Despite me seeking information, I have been unable to receive any relevant answers and documents explaining the incident and have been confined to the knowledge and version set out by the media,"" she said in her letter, as quoted by CNBC-TV18. 'Compelled to sign documents without even the time to read them' Rani Kapur alleged that she was ""compelled"" to sign various documents without explanation or even having time to read them during the time of mourning. ""Despite being under immense mental and emotional distress, I was coerced into signing such documents behind locked doors and though I’ve requested repeatedly, the contents of such documents have never been revealed to me. Please also take note that I have been totally denied access to my accounts and have been left to the mercy of a select few for survival. All this, in less than a month of my only son passing away,"" she said in her letter. She alleged that while the family was still in mourning, some people took it as an opportune time to wrest control and usurp the family legacy. She added that several resolutions, including one to appoint director as the representative of the Kapur family, are set to be voted upon during the AGM, without informing the family. ""I've been informed that certain people are representing themselves as being the largest shareholders of the Company since they claim to represent the interest of the family in the Company. I am fully convinced that the documents which were executed by me under coercion and duress, post the demise of my son, at a time of mental and emotional vulnerability are being misused,"" Rani Kapur alleged. Sunjay Kapur's mother further highlighted that she hasn't consented to anyone to represent herself before the company. ""If the Board and the shareholders however choose to ignore this letter, which I am writing in my capacity of not just being the grieving mother of Sunjay Kapur, but also the head of the Kapur family and the largest shareholder of the Company, it would be a clear case of mismanagement and breach of trust by the Company,"" she said while asking the board to unconditionally defer the AGM. The shares of Sona BLW sharply fell nearly 3 percent to trade at Rs 477 apiece in the afternoon."

Sustained FII selling of Rs 11,572 crores in the last four trading days will weigh on the market. The weakness in the broader market, particularly in smallcaps, might continue since valuations had turned excessive and difficult to justify,"" V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments Ltd, said. Trade deal uncertainty with the US and weak Q1 earnings from largecap names will likely have a bearing on the markets, experts say. Markets remained under pressure on July 25, with most NSE sectoral indices trading in the red. Nifty Energy, Auto, Metal, and Smallcap indices, fell between 1.2–1.5 percent. The Nifty Bank index dropped 0.6 percent, while both the Private and PSU Bank indices also saw cuts. The IT, Consumer Durables, and Realty sectors were down around half a percent each. On the positive side, Nifty Pharma bucked the trend with a modest gain of 0.29 percent. Meanwhile, India VIX rose over 5 percent, indicating heightened market volatility.

JPMorgan downgraded its rating on Bajaj Finance to 'neutral', from 'overweight' earlier. The brokerage noted that while Bajaj Finance remains a top-tier NBFC, the unexpected MSME stress and weak 2W/3W loans may lead to earnings downgrades. After crashing almost 30 percent in the previous session, shares of Indian Energy Exchange Ltd (IEX) took a U-turn to soar over 12 percent in the early session on Friday, July 25. Indian Energy Exchange reported a standalone net profit of Rs 113 crore for the first quarter of the financial year 2026, up 21 percent from the Rs 93 crore net profit reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year.

The company’s net profit surged 89.7 percent year-on-year to Rs 140 crore in the April–June quarter. Experts say the positive momentum also stems from the India-UK FTA, which will benefit textile stocks. Technical View ""The Nifty gave up all of Wednesday’s gains, falling 159 points to close at 25,062. On the charts, another bearish engulfing candle has formed—two in quick succession, a rare and bearish signal. Key levels are now well-defined, with 25,000 acting as crucial support and 25,245 as immediate resistance. The bears are likely to stay in control unless the index closes above 25,340. Meanwhile, Asian markets are trading weak, even as US index futures edge higher,"" Akshay Chinchalkar, Head of Research at Axis Securities, said. SBI Life Insurance, Dr Reddy's, Apollo Hospitals, Sun Pharma, and Bharti Airtel were the top gainers on the Nifty. Laggards on the index included Bajaj Finance, Shriram Finance, Bajaj Finserv, IndusInd Bank, and Bajaj Auto.

"Phoenix Mills to buy out CPP Investments stake in subsidiary, shares surge 6% on hopes of value unlocking",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/phoenix-mills-to-buy-out-cpp-investments-stake-in-subsidiary-shares-surge-5-on-hopes-of-value-unlocking-13324676.html,"The shares of Phoenix Mills surged nearly 6 percent on July 25, a day after the company announced the plan to acquire remaining 49 percent stake in subsidiary Island Star Mall Developers (ISMDPL) from CPP Investments. Brokerages noted that the deal may unlock long term value for the stock. Phoenix Mills released its results in the post market hours of July 24. The firm's net profit rose 3.5 percent on-year to Rs 241 crore in Q1 FY26 from Rs 232.5 crore in Q1 FY25. Its revenue from operations meanwhile rose 5 percent year-on-year to Rs 953 crore during the quarter under review. Operating EBITDA grew 6 percent on-year to Rs 564 crore, while EBITDA margin remained flat at 59 percent. The company announced that its board also approved the proposed transaction for the buy-out of the 49 percent shareholding of Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP Investments) in Island Star Mall Developers Private Limited (ISMDPL). Once completed, the stake buyout will take Phoenix's shareholding in the subsidiary from the existing 51 percent to 100 percent. CPP Investments will exit ISMDPL, a mall and offices development platform that had formed with Phoenix in 2017, with CPP Investments receiving around Rs 5,449 crore as part of the stake buyout. The platform includes a shopping mall in Indore, and two retail-led mixed-use mall-and-office developments in Bengaluru and Pune. In an exchange filing, PML announced that the company will pay the consideration to CPP Investments over four tranches in a three-year period. For FY25, the three projects that are part of the ISMDPL platform, had a consolidated turnover of nearly Rs 920 crore, compared to Rs 612 crore the year prior. ""ISMDPL marked the beginning of our long-standing partnership with CPP Investments. What started with a single asset has grown into a portfolio of premium, retail-led mixed-use developments across key urban centres. As we consolidate our stake in the JV, we remain focused on building on this strong foundation and creating some of the most vibrant and high-performing mixed-use destinations in the country,"" said Atul Ruia, Chairman at Phoenix Mills. He added that the firm’s other collaborations with CPP Investments will continue as planned. The firm's MD Shishir Shrivastava meanwhile said that this transaction will allow the firm to ""consolidate full ownership of a portfolio of high-quality, retail-led mixed-use assets across key Indian cities"". Motilal Oswal Financial Services kept a 'Neutral' rating on the stock, but cut its target price to Rs 1,646 apiece. This implies an upside potential of nearly 14 percent from the stock’s previous closing price of Rs 1,448 apiece. The domestic brokerage noted that the firm's earnings missed its estimates significantly. However, the acquisition may unlock long term value as it strengthens its high quality retail asset portfolio. ""The transaction is expected to be earnings-accretive from year one, with a significant upside when rental income stabilizes and the 2.71msf incremental FSI potential is developed over the medium-term post FY27. Staggered payments over three years takes net debt-to-equity to 0.2x for the FY27 which was expected to net cash earlier,"" it said. HDFC Securities also noted that Phoenix Mills reported a muted quarter, with its earnings missing out on estimates on several fronts. The brokerage however remained positive about the firm's proposed acquisition. ""The transaction implies an EV of Rs 117 bn (5.3% cap rate on FY25 EBITDA, can add INR 65/share to SOTP) for the platform. The deal strengthens Phoenix’s portfolio and offers strategic flexibility for long-term expansion,"" the firm said. Phoenix Mills shares were trading at Rs 1,538 apiece. The stock has gained nearly 3 percent in the past five days, but dropped over 5 percent in the past one month.

"Trident shares rally 7% as Q1 net profit climbs 90%; lower expenses, input costs help",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trident-shares-rally-7-as-q1-net-profit-climbs-90-lower-expenses-input-costs-help-13324583.html,"Shares of Trident Ltd. climbed as much as 7 percent to Rs 33.66 in morning trade on Friday, July 25, after the home textiles and paper products manufacturer posted a sharp jump in quarterly profit, brushing aside a slight dip in revenue. The company’s net profit surged 89.7 percent year-on-year to Rs 140 crore in the April–June quarter, compared to Rs 73.8 crore a year ago. This improvement came even as operating revenue slipped 2.1 percent to Rs 1,706.8 crore. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates What drove the stellar profit growth was a meaningful cut in expenses — down about 7 percent from last year — which helped lift margins. Trident’s EBITDA rose 29.3 percent to Rs 291 crore, and its operating margin expanded to 17 percent from 12.9 percent in the same period last year. Trident, which supplies home textiles to global retail giants like Walmart and Target, also appears to be benefiting from more stable input costs. Cotton prices, which were a drag on margins last year amid an 18 percent surge, have softened in recent months, offering some relief as far as raw material costs are concerned.

At about 9:45 pm, shares of the company were trading at Rs 33.4, higher by 6 percent from the last close on the NSE. Trident shares have risen 20 percent in the last three months.

SBI Life reported a 14 percent year-on-year rise in net profit to Rs 594 crore for Q1 FY26 up from Rs 520 crore in the same quarter last year. The company’s net premium income for the quarter stood at Rs 17,178.5 crore, marking a 14 percent increase over Rs 15,105.5 crore recorded in Q1 FY25. The value of new business (VNB) generated during the quarter stood at Rs 1,090 crore, reflecting continued growth in new business acquisition. At 9.35 a.m., shares of the firm were quoting Rs 1,834, higher by 2.3 percent on the NSE compared to the previous session's closing price. Should you buy, sell, or hold shares of SBI Life? Hong Kong-based CLSA maintained an 'outperform' rating on SBI Life with a target price of Rs ,180 per share. The brokerage highlighted a strong Q1FY26 performance, with VNB (Value of New Business) margin improving by 60 basis points year-on-year to 27.4 percent. This margin expansion was driven by a shift in the product mix away from ULIPs. However, Annualized Premium Equivalent (APE) growth came in at 9 percent year-on-year, weighed down by a flat performance in the agency channel. Despite this, management remains confident of achieving mid-teens APE growth in FY26. HDFC Securities has a 'high-conviction buy' on SBI Life, anchored on three 'power and sustainable moats.' The first is exclusive access to SBI’s massive distribution network. SBI Life's scope for improvement in margin-accretive traditional mix and cost leadership are the second and third moats.

The international company further said that REC's disbursements jumped 36 percent on-year, led by distribution segment. CLSA kept a 'High Conviction Outperform' call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 525 apiece. This implies a strong upside potential of nearly 30 percent from the stock’s previous closing price.

TRN Energy Resolution and provision reversals were key drivers of the earnings. UBS kept a 'Buy’ call on the stock, with a target price o Rs 550 per share. This implies an upside potential of nearly 36 percent from the stock’s previous closing price, the highest among the three brokerage notes analysed here.

"Hexaware Technologies shares tank 6% on weak Q1, poor guidance",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/hexaware-technologies-shares-tank-6-on-weak-q1-poor-guidance-13324348.html,"Shares of Hexaware Technologies, which recently made its return to the public markets, slipped 6 percent to Rs 779 in morning trade on July 25 after it reported a muted performance for the April-June quarter of 2025, as exceptional costs dragged down profitability. The company follows a calendar-year format for financial reporting. Revenue in constant currency terms rose 1.3 percent, falling short of Street expectations pegged at 2.5 percent for the quarter under review, the company said in an exchange filing. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates The quarter saw a steep rise in other expenses, which surged to Rs 142 crore from Rs 8.7 crore in the year-ago period. This included customer-related provisions of Rs 78.2 crore, ERP transformation costs of Rs 12 crore, acquisition-related expenses worth Rs 12.8 crore, and an impairment of Rs 39.4 crore linked to a customer contract from an earlier acquisition. As a result, operating performance weakened. EBITDA fell to Rs 404 crore from Rs 431 crore last year, and from Rs 527.8 crore in the March quarter. EBITDA margin dropped to 12.4 percent, down from 16.5 percent in the previous quarter and 14.7 percent a year earlier. However, when adjusted for these one-time items, the margin improves significantly to 18.1 percent—up from 17 percent in the March quarter. The company has reaffirmed its full-year EBITDA margin guidance of 17.1–17.4 percent. Also read: UK-India FTA: UK will have to wait at least half a decade for most tariff lines to go zero On the business front, while smaller and mid-sized deals continue to progress, large deal closures remain stuck in prolonged decision cycles. This has led Hexaware to tone down its expectations for the remainder of the year. IT services company Hexaware Technologies relisted on stock exchanges after four years, notching up handsome gains on February 19 as the stock ended with gains of 7 percent on debut. The IPO comprised only an offer-for-sale by its promoter, CA Magnum Holdings, which is an investment holding company created by Carlyle to buy Hexaware. The global digital and technology services provider did not get any IPO proceeds, as all the public issue fund was received by the selling shareholder. At about 9:25 am, shares of the company were trading at Rs 782, lower by 5.3 percent from the last close on the NSE. Hexaware Tech shares have been on a solid run lately, rising over 20 percent in the last three months.

Barring pharma, all major sectors slipped into the red, with the broader market taking a heavier hit. At about 10:30 am, the Sensex was down 578 points or 0.7 percent at 81,606, and the Nifty was down 194.5 points or 0.78 percent at 24,867. About 577 shares advanced, 2,045 shares declined, and 86 shares were unchanged.

""Though the Q1 earnings are broadly in line, it does not justify the premium valuation; India is trading at a 3-year high of 21x P/E,"" says Vinod Nair, Head of Strategy at Geojit Investments Limited, said. ""We expect stock-specific action to persist as earnings remain the key driver for near-term market direction,"" Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Retail Research at Motilal Oswal, said. At the July 25 market open, sectoral indices were largely in the red, reflecting a subdued start. The Nifty Auto index slipped 0.78 percent, leading the losses, followed by declines in Nifty Media, Metal, and Consumer Durables. Banking indices were mixed—Nifty Bank edged down 0.17 percent, while PSU Bank bucked the trend with a 0.41 percent gain. Nifty IT and Energy also posted mild losses, down 0.19 percent and 0.43 percent, respectively. Broader markets were weak, with the Nifty Midcap 100 down 0.41 percent and Smallcap 100 losing 0.62 percent. Meanwhile, India VIX rose over 5 percent, indicating a sharp uptick in market volatility. Bajaj Finance shares slipped 6 percent after brokerages dished out bearish calls on the stock. This comes after the company reported a 22 percent jump in consolidated net profit at Rs 4,765 crore. Brokerages say that stress in the MSME segment has led to a sharp surge in credit costs. Further, the management raised concerns over continued over-leveraging and warned of potential profitability pressure ahead as loan spreads narrow. SBI Life Insurance shares rose over 2 percent after it reported a 14 percent year-on-year rise in net profit to Rs 594 crore for Q1 FY26, up from Rs 520 crore in the same quarter last year. The company’s net premium income for the quarter stood at Rs 17,178.5 crore, marking a 14 percent increase over Rs 15,105.5 crore recorded in Q1 FY25. JPMorgan downgraded the stock to neutral while CLSA maintained its outperform call. Hexaware Tech shares slumped as much as 6 percent after the company posted a revenue decline in Q2. A spike in other expenses also weighed on margins. On the deal front, management said large consolidation deals remain in progress, while smaller ones are moving forward. However, slower decision-making has tempered expectations for the rest of the year. Technical View Technically, the index has slipped back into a choppy trading band, hovering between its 20-day EMA and 50-day EMA, placed at 25,150 and 24,950, respectively. A sustained breakout above the 25,300 level is still awaited to confirm bullish momentum. On the downside, the 50-day EMA near 24,950, combined with the psychological mark of 25,000, forms a critical support shelf for bulls, possibly their last line of defence. Notably, the 24,800–24,900 cluster has repeatedly served as a strong base throughout the month, and with the index oscillating in this pocket, dips are likely to attract renewed buying as long as 24,800 holds firm.

Asian markets traded lower, while the US stock market ended mixed overnight, with the Nasdaq and S&P closing at record highs. The Gift Nifty was trading at 24,997, lower by 0.36 percent. Dalal Street came under pressure on Thursday, July 24, as weak earnings and margin misses in the IT and FMCG sectors triggered a selloff. The Nifty IT index dropped over 2 percent, weighed down by Persistent Systems, Coforge, and Infosys. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Foreign institutional investors (FII/FPI) were net sellers on July 24, selling shares worth Rs 2,134 crore, while domestic institutional investors (DII) were net buyers of shares worth Rs 2,617 crore, provisional data showed. Here are the key levels to watch out for in today's session Technically, the index has slipped back into a choppy trading band, hovering between its 20-day EMA and 50-day EMA, placed at 25,150 and 24,950, respectively. A sustained breakout above the 25,300 level is still awaited to confirm bullish momentum. On the downside, the 50-day EMA near 24,950, combined with the psychological mark of 25,000, forms a critical support shelf for bulls, possibly their last line of defence. Notably, the 24,800–24,900 cluster has repeatedly served as a strong base throughout the month, and with the index oscillating in this pocket, dips are likely to attract renewed buying as long as 24,800 holds firm. A decisive close above 25,250 remains the key to reversing the current bearish bias and reviving a broader bullish tone. ""The index remains stuck in a sideways range, reflecting ongoing trader uncertainty. Technically, it faces stiff resistance near 57,350, while strong support lies around 56,600. Unless the index decisively breaks above 57,300, bullish momentum is likely to remain capped,"" Dhupesh Dhameja of SAMCO Securities said. ""On the downside, the 20-day EMA around 56,800 and the horizontal support zone near 56,600 form a crucial buffer. This 56,600–56,800 range has consistently held firm through the month, encouraging buying on dips. A sustained close above 57,350 is key to reversing the bearish undertone,"" he added. India VIX ticked up mildly by 2 percent, settling at 10.72. Despite the rise, it remains comfortably below the psychological threshold of 13, reflecting a market still devoid of panic or aggressive de-risking. The low-volatility backdrop suggests that while intraday selling persists, there’s no fear-driven rush to exit longs, further validating the ongoing phase of range-bound action rather than a decisive trend breakdown. The Put-Call Ratio (PCR) slipped from 1.08 to 0.76, indicating a rise in call writing and a gradual bearish tilt in positioning. This tug-of-war between option writers at 25,000 and 25,200 levels highlights the broader indecision in the market.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Gujarat Pipavav Port, RCF, Swan Energy, Jindal Steel, Shyam Metalics, Dixon Technologies, REC and others on July 25?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-gujarat-pipavav-port-rcf-swan-energy-jindal-steel-shyam-metalics-dixon-technologies-rec-and-others-on-july-25-13322999.html,"The frontline indices could not sustain their previous day's gains due to selling pressure, falling a little over 0.6 percent on July 24, with market breadth dominated by bears. About 1,721 shares saw a correction compared to 921 that advanced on the NSE. The consolidation is expected to continue, with benchmark indices likely finding support at the 50-day EMA. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Jay Mehta, Technical Research at JM Financial Services Gujarat Pipavav Port | CMP: Rs 165.83 GPPL has broken out from a symmetrical triangle pattern and has successfully retested the breakout zone, rebounding strongly. The breakout was accompanied by a significant volume surge, with an additional volume spike observed on the recent bullish Belt Hold candle formed at the 200-day EMA—indicating bullish strength. The stock is trading above both short- and long-term moving averages, reflecting strong relative strength. The short-term outlook remains positive. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 176, Rs 182 Stop-Loss: Rs 153 Rashtriya Chemicals & Fertilizers | CMP: Rs 157.18 RCF has broken out above a descending triangle pattern with notable volume expansion, signaling strong bullish momentum. The stock is trading above its short- and long-term moving averages, confirming the uptrend. Momentum indicators support further upside, with the RSI moving above 50 and the MACD trending upward from its centerline. A decisive break above Rs 160 could drive the stock toward targets of Rs 168 and Rs 173. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 168, Rs 173 Stop-Loss: Rs 149 Swan Energy | CMP: Rs 509.75 Swan Energy broke out from a prolonged consolidation phase on July 15, backed by strong volumes. The stock is now consolidating in a tight range above the 200-day EMA, indicating a temporary pause in bullish momentum. Strong relative strength and momentum indicators suggest continued bullishness in the near term. The price action is forming a flag-and-pole pattern, and a breakout above Rs 526 could trigger renewed bullish momentum, with targets at Rs 590 and Rs 610. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 590, Rs 610 Stop-Loss: Rs 459 Hardik Matalia, Derivative Analyst at Choice Broking Jindal Steel & Power | CMP: Rs 1,000.45 Jindal Steel & Power has shown a strong technical breakout. The stock has recently completed the formation of a classic Inverted Head & Shoulders pattern—a bullish reversal formation that typically signals the end of a downtrend and the beginning of an uptrend. The neckline resistance above Rs 980 has been breached, supported by rising volumes and strong momentum. The stock is trading well above all standard EMAs, indicating strong momentum. A follow-through action above Rs 1,000 would confirm the trend extension. Momentum oscillators like RSI and MACD are likely in bullish zones, given the sharp rally and volume behaviour. Price is riding the upper Bollinger Band, reflecting strong trend intensity and the characteristics of a sustained uptrend. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,090 Stop-Loss: Rs 960 Lupin | CMP: Rs 1,941.4 Lupin has delivered a decisive move on the technical chart, breaking out from a falling trendline—indicating a potential reversal from its recent downtrend. The breakout zone, stemming from the January 2025 highs, had consistently acted as resistance. Thursday’s breakout above this trendline signals a shift in sentiment. This development marks a significant technical turning point after months of consolidation and downward pressure. The current price has crossed above the 20 EMA and is now approaching the 100 EMA resistance zone. Sustaining above Rs 1,950–1,960 could trigger further bullish momentum. Volume expansion near the breakout zone typically supports the sustainability of the up move. Additionally, the recent formation of higher lows reflects base building and reduced selling pressure. On the downside, immediate support is located at Rs 1,900, while a stop-loss at Rs 1,870 (recent swing low) is recommended to manage risk. The RSI, currently at 50.03, is trending upward—indicating growing buying momentum. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,100 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,870 Shyam Metalics and Energy | CMP: Rs 951.9 Shyam Metalics has confirmed a Cup and Handle pattern breakout on the daily chart. The breakout above the neckline zone of Rs 940–945 came after a well-rounded cup formation followed by a short-term consolidation handle. The stock is trading well above all key EMAs, reflecting strong bullish sentiment and overall trend alignment. Earlier this month, the 20-EMA crossover above the 50-EMA signaled a strengthening trend. In recent weeks, the stock had moved sideways with a mild downward drift—perfectly forming the handle part of the pattern. The breakout above Rs 945 confirms the bullish continuation, with potential for new highs. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,030 Stop-Loss: Rs 915 Om Mehra, Technical Research Analyst at Samco Securities Dixon Technologies | CMP: Rs 16,768 Dixon Technologies has continued its strong upward momentum, registering a breakout from a flag pattern formation—a classic bullish continuation pattern that follows a steep rally. The stock has resumed its uptrend, supported by above-average volume, confirming strength behind the move. Dixon is trading comfortably above all key moving averages. The clean separation from short-term EMAs highlights its strong bullish undertone. The RSI remains at 70, maintaining a rising slope with no sign of reversal. The MACD shows a strong bullish crossover, with the signal lines trending higher, indicating continued upside momentum. A falling flag breakout has occurred just below recent highs, and the breakout candle has held above the previous resistance. The weekly chart also remains bullish. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 17,700 Stop-Loss: Rs 16,250 REC | CMP: Rs 404.9 REC is breaking out from a short-term ascending triangle pattern on the daily chart. The stock has crossed above the Rs 400 mark, a key resistance level in recent sessions. The breakout occurred with increased volume, suggesting building bullish momentum. The price is now trading above both the 20-day and 50-day moving averages, signaling a strengthening short-term trend. The upward-sloping trendline from the Rs 394 zone has provided solid support during the recent consolidation. The RSI has improved to 56, rising above the neutral 50 mark and showing positive momentum. The slope remains upward, validating the strength behind the breakout. The hourly Supertrend could act as support in case of short-term pullbacks. The Rs 400 level, now a former resistance, has turned into immediate support.

India-UK FTA set to boost pharma and medtech trade,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/india-uk-fta-set-to-boost-pharma-and-medtech-trade-13322107.html,"The landmark India-UK Free Trade Agreement signed Thursday is poised to boost bilateral trade dynamics, particularly in the pharmaceutical and medical devices sectors, where India has emerged as a key supplier of affordable healthcare solutions, industry executives told Moneycontrol. The deal, which eliminates tariffs on most finished pharmaceutical products and medical devices, is expected to boost India’s exports to the UK valued at over $914 million grew 18% year-on-year (YoY) in FY24 . Imports from UK stood at $430.15 million with a YoY growth of 13%, according Exim data. Drug formulations and biologicals 84.7% share share of total Indian exports to UK. India exported medical devices worth Rs 1,015.02 crore to UK in FY24, which grew year-on-year (YoY) at 13.11%, while import from UK grew even impressive at 36.45% (YoY) to ₹2,295.37 crore in the same period. India medical device exports to UK were contact lens, diagnostic reagents, surgical instruments and PPE kits; major imports were Oxygen therapy equipment like ventilators, X-Ray equipment, diagnostic testing reagents and IVD analysis instruments. Currently UK charges zero duties on Indian pharmaceutical imports, while India levies a 10% basic customs duty on pharmaceuticals, with exemptions for certain life-saving drugs. For medical devices, custom duties by India range from 0% to 7.5%, depending on the category. Broadly, the UK will remove duties on 99% of Indian exports, while India will cut tariffs on 90% of UK products, aiming to increase annual bilateral trade by USD 34 billion. Pharma to benefit With major Indian pharma firms like Dr. Reddy’s, Sun Pharma, Cipla, Torrent Pharma, Intas, and Biocon already entrenched in the UK market, the FTA is expected to deepen their footprint. The deal also aligns with India’s ambition to become a global hub for affordable healthcare and medtech innovation. ""The pharmaceutical industry welcomes the India-UK Free Trade Agreement,"" said Sudarshan Jain, Secretary General, Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance, the industry body that represents large homegrown pharmaceutical companies. ""This will open up trade and economic opportunities between the two countries. As per the indications, the pharma sector will have opportunities to supply affordable and quality assured medicine contributing to better patient care in the UK,"" Jain added. “This partnership paves the way for collaborations in bulk drug imports, CDMO, and joint research, empowering India’s competitive edge and promoting global partnerships,” said Namit Joshi, Chairman of Pharmexcil, the trade body on Department of Pharmaceutical, Ministry of Commerce. As regulatory harmonization progresses, the India-UK FTA could serve as a blueprint for similar agreements with other developed markets, reinforcing India’s role in global health supply chains, said Sanjaya Mariwala, Executive Chairman of OmniActive Health Technologies and President of Mumbai-based IMC Chamber of Commerce and Industry. “With regulatory barriers coming down, Indian healthcare companies will find it easier to operate in the UK, leading to more affordable services and better collaboration,” he said. Medical devices trade boost “The FTA will significantly enhance access to high-quality, affordable medical devices in the UK market,” said Himanshu Baid, Managing Director of Poly Medicure Ltd. “It opens new avenues for advanced technology collaborations and innovation.” “We sought recognition of Indian CDSCO regulatory approval to fast-track UK MHRA approvals,” added Rajiv Nath, Forum Coordinator at AiMeD. “This would address non-tariff barriers and help Indian exporters compete more effectively.” While the FTA removes tariff barriers, Indian medical device stakeholders have raised concerns over regulatory costs and the potential misuse of rules of origin. Industry leaders are urging strict monitoring to prevent third-country products from being routed through the UK."

Volume growth was 11% YoY (est. 4%, 5% in 4Q, 6% in FY25), aided by share gain and a low base from the election-impacted quarter last year. Of the overall growth, 2-2.5% was attributed to the low base.

Regionally, North, West, and South posted growth of 8%, 13%, and 16%, respectively, while the East declined 1%. Volume growth was led by Andhra Pradesh, Assam, and Uttar Pradesh, though partly offset by declines in Karnataka and West Bengal. A favorable price mix supported revenue, aided by hikes in Telangana, UP, Orissa, and Rajasthan, along with continued premiumization.

PAT grew ~30% YoY to INR2.0b (~12% beat).Management indicated the demand outlook remains strong, led by power T&D, renewable energy, data center, and manufacturing sectors. KEII retains its FY26 growth guidance of ~18-19% and ~20% in next two to three years. This will be led by the completion of the Sanand expansion and KEII’s continued expansion strategy (bought land in Gujarat and Rajasthan for future expansions).

Further, the completion of Sanand Phase I is likely to improve its margins.

Asian shares are mixed after Wall Street sets more records for US stocks,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/asian-shares-are-mixed-after-wall-street-sets-more-records-for-us-stocks-2025-07-27/,"BANGKOK (AP) — Stock markets in Asia were mixed on Monday after U.S. stocks rose to more records as they closed out another winning week. U.S. futures and oil prices were higher ahead of trade talks in Stockholm between U.S. and Chinese officials. European futures rose after the European Union forged a deal with the Trump administration calling for 15% tariffs on most exports to the U.S. The agreement announced after President Donald Trump and European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen met briefly at Trump’s Turnberry golf course in Scotland staves off far higher import duties on both sides that might have sent shock waves through economies around the globe. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index lost 1% to 41,056.81 after doubts surfaced over what exactly the trade truce between Japan and U.S. President Donald Trump, especially the $550 billion pledge of investment in the U.S. by Japan, will entail. Terms of the deal are still being negotiated and nothing has been formalized in writing, said an official, who insisted on anonymity to detail the terms of the talks. The official suggested the goal was for a $550 billion fund to make investments at Trump’s direction. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index gained 0.4% to 25,490.45 while the Shanghai Composite index lost 0.2% to 3,587.25. Taiwan's Taiex rose 0.3%. CK Hutchison, a Hong Kong conglomerate that’s selling ports at the Panama Canal, said it may seek a Chinese investor to join a consortium of buyers in a move that might please Beijing but could also bring more U.S. scrutiny to a geopolitically fraught deal. CK Hutchison's shares fell 0.6% on Monday in Hong Kong. Elsewhere in Asia, South Korea's Kospi was little changed at 3,195.49, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.3% to 8,688.40. India's Sensex slipped 0.1%. Markets in Thailand were closed for a holiday. On Friday, the S&P 500 rose 0.4% to 6,388.64, setting an all-time for the fifth time in a week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.5% to 44,901.92, while the Nasdaq composite added 0.2%, closing at 21,108.32 to top its own record. Deckers, the company behind Ugg boots and Hoka shoes, jumped 11.3% after reporting stronger profit and revenue for the spring than analysts expected. Its growth was particularly strong outside the United States, where revenue soared nearly 50%. But Intell fell 8.5% after reporting a loss for the latest quarter, when analysts were looking for a profit. The struggling chipmaker also said it would cut thousands of jobs and eliminate other expenses as it tries to turn around its fortunes. Intel, which helped launch Silicon Valley as the U.S. technology hub, has fallen behind rivals like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices while demand for artificial intelligence chips soars. Companies are under pressure to deliver solid growth in profits to justify big gains for their stock prices, which have rallied to record after record in recent weeks. Wall Street has zoomed higher on hopes that President Donald Trump will reach trade deals with other countries that will lower his stiff proposed tariffs, along with the risk that they could cause a recession and drive up inflation. Trump has recently announced deals with Japan and the Philippines, and the next big deadline is looming on Friday, Aug. 1. Apart from trade talks, this week will also feature a meeting by the Federal Reserve on interest rates. Trump again on Thursday lobbied the Fed to cut rates, which he has implied could save the U.S. government money on its debt repayments. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said he is waiting for more data about how Trump’s tariffs affect the economy and inflation before making a move. The widespread expectation on Wall Street is that the Fed will wait until September to resume cutting interest rates. In other dealings early Monday, U.S. benchmark crude oil gained 24 cents to $65.40 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, also added 24 cents to $67.90 per barrel. The dollar rose to 147.72 Japanese yen from 147.71 yen. The euro slipped to $1.1755 from $1.1758."
"As Dubai cracks down on crowded jerry-rigged apartments, migrant workers have nowhere else to go",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/as-dubai-cracks-down-on-crowded-jerry-rigged-apartments-migrant-workers-have-nowhere-else-to-go-2025-07-27/,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Lights flicker, doors hang off their hinges and holes in the walls expose pipes in the apartment building where Hesham, an Egyptian migrant worker, lives in Dubai, an emirate better known for its flashy skyscrapers and penthouses. His two-bedroom rental unit is carved up to house nine other men, and what he calls home is a modified closet just big enough for a mattress. But now the government has ordered the 44-year-old salesman out of even that cramped space, which costs him $270 a month. He's one of the many low-paid foreign laborers caught up in a widespread crackdown by authorities in Dubai over illegal subletting. That includes rooms lined with bunk beds that offer no privacy but are as cheap as a few dollars a night, as well as partitioned apartments like Hesham's, where plywood boards, drywall and plastic shower curtains can turn a flat into a makeshift dormitory for 10 or 20 people. After a blaze at a high-rise in June, Dubai officials launched the campaign over concerns that partitioned apartments represent a major fire risk. Some of those evicted have been left scrambling to stay off the streets, where begging is illegal. Others fear they could be next, uncertain when or where inspectors might show up. “Now we don’t know what we’ll do,” said Hesham, who's staying put until his landlord evicts him. Like others living in Dubai's cheapest and most crowded spaces, he spoke to The Associated Press on condition only his first name be used for fear of coming into the crosshairs of authorities enforcing the ban on illegal housing. “We don’t have any other choice,"" he said. Dubai Municipality, which oversees the city-state, declined an AP request for an interview. In a statement, it said authorities have conducted inspections across the emirate to curb fire and safety hazards — an effort it said would “ensure the highest standards of public safety” and lead to “enhanced quality of life” for tenants. It didn't address where those unable to afford legal housing would live in a city-state that’s synonymous with luxury yet outlaws labor unions and guarantees no minimum wage. Dubai has seen a boom since the pandemic that shows no signs of stopping. Its population of 3.9 million is projected to grow to 5.8 million by 2040 as more people move into the commercial hub from abroad. Much of Dubai’s real estate market caters to wealthy foreign professionals living there long-term. That leaves few affordable options for the majority of workers — migrants on temporary, low-wage contracts, often earning just several hundred dollars a month. Nearly a fifth of homes in Dubai were worth more than $1 million as of last year, property firm Knight Frank said. Developers are racing to build more high-end housing. That continued growth has meant rising rents across the board. Short-term rentals are expected to cost 18% more by the end of this year compared to 2024, according to online rental company Colife. Most migrant workers the AP spoke to said they make just $300 to $550 a month. In lower-income areas, they said, a partitioned apartment space generally rents for $220 to $270 a month, while a single bunk in an undivided room costs half as much. Both can cost less if shared, or more depending on size and location. At any rate, they are far cheaper than the average one-bedroom rental, which real estate firm Engel & Völkers said runs about $1,400 a month. The United Arab Emirates, like other Gulf Arab nations, relies on low-paid workers from Africa and Asia to build, clean, babysit and drive taxi cabs. Only Emirati nationals, who are outnumbered nearly 9 to 1 by residents from foreign countries, are eligible for an array of government benefits, including financial assistance for housing. Large employers, from construction firms and factories to hotels and resorts, are required by law to house workers if they are paid less than $400 a month, much of which they send home to families overseas. However, many migrants are employed informally, making their living arrangements hard to regulate, said Steffen Hertog, an expert on Gulf labor markets at the London School of Economics and Political Science. The crackdown will push up their housing costs, creating “a lot of stress for people whose life situation is already precarious,” he said. Hassan, a 24-year-old security guard from Uganda, shares a bed in a partitioned apartment with a friend. So far, the government hasn’t discovered it, but he has reason to be nervous, he said. “They can tell you to leave without an option, without anywhere to go.” Dubai has targeted overcrowded apartments in the past amid a spate of high-rise fires fueled by flammable siding material. The latest round of inspections came after a blaze in June at a 67-story tower in the Dubai Marina neighborhood, where some apartments had been partitioned. More than 3,800 residents were forced to evacuate from the building, which had 532 occupied apartments, according to a police report. That means seven people on average lived in each of these units in the tower of one-, two- and three-bedroom flats. Dozens of homes were left uninhabitable. There were no major injuries in that fire. However, another in 2023 in Dubai’s historic Deira neighborhood killed at least 16 people and injured another nine in a unit believed to have been partitioned. Ebony, a 28-year-old odd-job worker from Ghana, was recently forced to leave a partitioned apartment after the authorities found out about it. She lived in a narrow space with a roommate who slept above her on a jerry-built plywood loft bed. “Sometimes to even stand up,” she said, “your head is going to hit the plywood.” She’s in a new apartment now, a single room that holds 14 others — and sometimes more than 20 as people come and go, sharing beds. With her income of about $400 a month, she said she didn’t have another option, and she’s afraid of being forced out again. “I don’t know what they want us to do. Maybe they don’t want the majority of people that are here in Dubai,” Ebony said."
Hong Kong's CK Hutchison seeks Chinese investor to join Panama Ports deal,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/hong-kongs-ck-hutchison-seeks-chinese-investor-to-join-panama-ports-deal-2025-07-27/,"HONG KONG (AP) — A Hong Kong conglomerate that's selling ports at the Panama Canal said Monday it may seek a Chinese investor to join a consortium of buyers, a move that could please Beijing but bring more U.S. scrutiny to the geopolitically fraught deal. CK Hutchison Holdings’ initial plan to sell port assets in dozens of countries to a group that includes U.S. investment firm BlackRock Inc. pleased President Donald Trump, who has alleged that China interferes with the critical shipping lane’s operations in Panama. However, they apparently angered Beijing and drew a review from Chinese anti-monopoly authorities. A Beijing-backed newspaper posted scathing commentaries about the deal, with one describing it as a betrayal of all Chinese. Beijing’s offices overseeing Hong Kong affairs have reposted some of these commentaries, widely seen as an indication of Chinese leaders’ stance. A Hutchison subsidiary has operated ports at both ends of the Panama Canal since 1997. After months of uncertainty brought by tensions between Washington and Beijing, Hutchison said in a statement that the exclusive negotiations period with the consortium has expired. However, it added “the Group remains in discussions with members of the consortium with a view to inviting major strategic investor from the PRC to join as a significant member of the consortium,” referring to the People’s Republic of China. It said they needed to change the membership of the consortium and the structure of the transaction for the deal to be able to pass reviews by “all relevant authorities."" The awkward position Hutchison found itself in for months highlights the challenges Hong Kong business elites face in navigating Beijing’s expectations of national loyalty, especially when relations between China and the United States are strained. Hong Kong has overhauled its electoral system to ensure the city is run by “patriots.” CK Hutchison is owned by the family of Hong Kong’s richest man, Li Ka-shing. It announced March 4 that it would sell all its shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and in Hutchison Port Group Holdings to the consortium that also includes BlackRock subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners and Terminal Investment Limited, a subsidiary of the Mediterranean Shipping Company. In May, Hutchinson co-managing director, Dominic Lai told shareholders that Terminal Investment was the main investor. Its parent company is led by Italian shipping scion Diego Aponte, whose family reportedly has a longstanding relationship with Li’s. The initial deal, valued at nearly $23 billion including $5 billion in debt, would have given the consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including the ports of Balboa and Cristobal, located at either end of the canal. That agreement also required approval from Panama’s government. The deadline for their exclusive negotiation period ended on July 27."
US and China to talk in Stockholm on trade with eye on Trump-Xi summit later this year,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/us-and-china-to-talk-in-stockholm-on-trade-with-eye-on-trump-xi-summit-later-this-year-2025-07-27/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — When top U.S. and Chinese officials meet in Stockholm, they are almost certain to agree to at least leaving tariffs at the current levels while working toward a meeting between their presidents later this year for a more lasting trade deal between the world's two largest economies, analysts say. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng are set to hold talks Monday for the third time this year — this round in the Swedish capital, nearly four months after President Donald Trump upset global trade with his sweeping tariff proposal, including an import tax that shot up to 145% on Chinese goods. “We have the confines of a deal with China,” Trump said Friday before leaving for Scotland. Bessent told MSNBC on Wednesday that the two countries after talks in Geneva and London have reached a “status quo,” with the U.S. taxing imported goods from China at 30% and China responding with a 10% tariff, on top of tariffs prior to the start of Trump's second term. “Now we can move on to discussing other matters in terms of bringing the economic relationship into balance,” Bessent said. He was referring to the U.S. running a $295.5 billion trade deficit last year. The U.S. seeks an agreement that would enable it to export more to China and shift the Chinese economy more toward domestic consumer spending. The Chinese embassy in Washington said Beijing hopes “there will be more consensus and cooperation and less misperception” coming out of the talks. With an eye on a possible leaders' summit, Stockholm could provide some answers as to the timeline and viability of that particular goal ahead of a possible meeting between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. “The meeting will be important in starting to set the stage for a fall meeting between Trump and Xi,” said Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. trade negotiator and now vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute. “Beijing will likely insist on detailed preparations before they agree to a leaders’ meeting.” In Stockholm, the two sides are likely to focus on commercial announcements to be made at a leaders’ summit as well as agreements to address “major irritants,” such as China's industrial overcapacity and its lack of control over chemicals used to make fentanyl, also to be announced when Xi and Trump should meet, Cutler said. Sean Stein, president of the U.S.-China Business Council, said Stockholm could be the first real opportunity for the two governments to address structural reform issues including market access in China for U.S. companies. What businesses will be seeking coming out of Stockholm would largely be “the atmosphere” — how the two sides characterize the discussions. They will also look for clues about a possible leaders’ summit because any real deal will hinge on the two presidents meeting each other, he said. In Stockholm, Beijing will likely demand the removal of the 20% fentanyl-related tariff that Trump imposed earlier this year, said Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Washington-based Stimson Center. This round of the U.S.-China trade dispute began with fentanyl, when Trump in February imposed a 10% tariff on Chinese goods, citing that China failed to curb the outflow of the chemicals used to make the drug. The following month, Trump added another 10% tax for the same reason. Beijing retaliated with extra duties on some U.S. goods, including coal, liquefied natural gas, and farm products such as beef, chicken, pork and soy. In Geneva, both sides climbed down from three-digit tariffs rolled out following Trump's “Liberation Day” tariffs in April, but the U.S. kept the 20% “fentanyl” tariffs, in addition to the 10% baseline rate — to which China responded by keeping the same 10% rate on U.S. products. These across-the-board duties were unchanged when the two sides met in London a month later to negotiate over non-tariff measures such as export controls on critical products. The Chinese government has long protested that American politicians blame China for the fentanyl crisis in the U.S. but argued the root problem lies with the U.S. itself. Washington says Beijing is not doing enough to regulate precursor chemicals that flow out of China into the hands of drug dealers. In July, China placed two fentanyl ingredients under enhanced control, a move seen as in response to U.S. pressure and signaling goodwill. Gabriel Wildau, managing director at the consultancy Teneo, said he doesn't expect any tariff to go away in Stockholm but that tariff relief could be part of a final trade deal. “It’s possible that Trump would cancel the 20% tariff that he has explicitly linked with fentanyl, but I would expect the final tariff level on China to be at least as high as the 15-20% rate contained in the recent deals with Japan, Indonesia, Vietnam,” Wildau said. China's industrial overcapacity is as much a headache for the United States as it is for the European Union. Even Beijing has acknowledged the problem but suggested it might be difficult to address. America’s trade imbalance with China has decreased from a peak of $418 billion in 2018, according to the Census Bureau. But China has found new markets for its goods and as the world’s dominant manufacturer ran a global trade surplus approaching $1 trillion last year — somewhat larger than the size of the U.S. overall trade deficit in 2024. And China’s emergence as a manufacturer of electric vehicles and other emerging technologies has suddenly made it more of a financial and geopolitical threat for those same industries based in the U.S., Europe, Japan and South Korea. “Some enterprises, especially manufacturing enterprises, feel more deeply that China’s manufacturing capabilities are too strong, and Chinese people are too hardworking. Factories run 24 hours a day,” Chinese Premier Li Qiang said on Thursday when hosting European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in Beijing. “Some people think this will cause some new problems in the balance of supply and demand in world production.” “We see this problem too,” Li said. Bessent also said the Stockholm talks could address Chinese purchases of Russian and Iranian oil. However, Wildau of Teneo said China could demand some U.S. security concessions in exchange, such as a reduced U.S. military presence in East Asia and scaled-back diplomatic support for Taiwan and the Philippines. This would likely face political pushback in Washington. The Stockholm talks will be “geared towards building a trade agreement based around Chinese purchase commitments and pledges of investment in the U.S. in exchange for partial relief from U.S. tariffs and export controls,” Wildau said. He doubts there will be a grand deal. Instead, he predicts “a more limited agreement based around fentanyl.” “That,” he said, “is probably the preferred outcome for China hawks in the Trump administration, who worry that an overeager Trump might offer too much to Xi.” ___ Associated Press writer Paul Wiseman contributed to this report"
US-EU trade deal wards off further escalation but will raise costs for companies and consumers,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/us-eu-trade-deal-wards-off-further-escalation-but-will-raise-costs-for-companies-consumers-2025-07-27/,"FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen have announced a sweeping trade deal that imposes 15% tariffs on most European goods, warding off Trump's threat of a 30% rate if no deal had been reached by Aug. 1. The tariffs, or import taxes, paid when Americans buy European products could raise prices for U.S. consumers and dent profits for European companies and their partners who bring goods into the country. Here are some things to know about the trade deal between the United States and the European Union: Trump and von der Leyen's announcement, made during Trump's visit to one of his golf courses in Scotland, leaves many details to be filled in. The headline figure is a 15% tariff rate on “the vast majority” of European goods brought into the U.S., including cars, computer chips and pharmaceuticals. It's lower than the 20% Trump initially proposed, and lower than his threats of 50% and then 30%. Von der Leyen said the two sides agreed on zero tariffs on both sides for a range of “strategic” goods: Aircraft and aircraft parts, certain chemicals, semiconductor equipment, certain agricultural products, and some natural resources and critical raw materials. Specifics were lacking. She said the two sides “would keep working” to add more products to the list. Additionally, the EU side would purchase what Trump said was $750 billion (638 billion euros) worth of natural gas, oil and nuclear fuel to replace Russian energy supplies, and Europeans would invest an additional $600 billion (511 billion euros) in the U.S. Trump said the 50% U.S. tariff on imported steel would remain; von der Leyen said the two sides agreed to further negotiations to fight a global steel glut, reduce tariffs and establish import quotas — that is, set amounts that can be imported, often at a lower rate. Trump said pharmaceuticals were not included in the deal. Von der Leyen said the pharmaceuticals issue was “on a separate sheet of paper” from Sunday's deal. Where the $600 billion for additional investment would come from was not specified. And von der Leyen said that when it came to farm products, the EU side made clear that “there were tariffs that could not be lowered,” without specifying which products. The 15% rate removes Trump's threat of a 30% tariff. It's still much higher than the average tariff before Trump came into office of around 1%, and higher than Trump's minimum 10% baseline tariff. Higher tariffs, or import taxes, on European goods mean sellers in the U.S. would have to either increase prices for consumers — risking loss of market share — or swallow the added cost in terms of lower profits. The higher tariffs are expected to hurt export earnings for European firms and slow the economy. The 10% baseline applied while the deal was negotiated was already sufficiently high to make the European Union's executive commission cut its growth forecast for this year from 1.3% to 0.9%. Von der Leyen said the 15% rate was “the best we could do” and credited the deal with maintaining access to the U.S. market and providing “stability and predictability for companies on both sides.” German Chancellor Friedrich Merz welcomed the deal which avoided “an unnecessary escalation in transatlantic trade relations"" and said that “we were able to preserve our core interests,” while adding that “I would have very much wished for further relief in transatlantic trade.” The Federation of German Industries was blunter. ""Even a 15% tariff rate will have immense negative effects on export-oriented German industry,"" said Wolfgang Niedermark, a member of the federation's leadership. While the rate is lower than threatened, ""the big caveat to today’s deal is that there is nothing on paper, yet,"" said Carsten Brzeski, global chief of macro at ING bank. “With this disclaimer in mind and at face value, today’s agreement would clearly bring an end to the uncertainty of recent months. An escalation of the US-EU trade tensions would have been a severe risk for the global economy,"" Brzeski said. “This risk seems to have been avoided.” Asked if European carmakers could still sell cars at 15%, von der Leyen said the rate was much lower than the current 27.5%. That has been the rate under Trump's 25% tariff on cars from all countries, plus the preexisting U.S. car tariff of 2.5%. The impact is likely to be substantial on some companies, given that automaker Volkswagen said it suffered a 1.3 billion euro ($1.5 billion) hit to profit in the first half of the year from the higher tariffs. Mercedes-Benz dealers in the U.S. have said they are holding the line on 2025 model year prices “until further notice.” The German automaker has a partial tariff shield because it makes 35% of the Mercedes-Benz vehicles sold in the U.S. in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, but the company said it expects prices to undergo “significant increases” in coming years. Before Trump returned to office, the U.S. and the EU maintained generally low tariff levels in what is the largest bilateral trading relationship in the world, with some 1.7 trillion euros ($2 trillion) in annual trade. Together the U.S. and the EU have 44% of the global economy. The U.S. rate averaged 1.47% for European goods, while the EU's averaged 1.35% for American products, according to the Bruegel think tank in Brussels. Trump has complained about the EU’s 198 billion-euro trade surplus in goods, which shows Americans buy more from European businesses than the other way around, and has said the European market is not open enough for U.S.-made cars. However, American companies fill some of the trade gap by outselling the EU when it comes to services such as cloud computing, travel bookings, and legal and financial services. And some 30% of European imports are from American-owned companies, according to the European Central Bank."
Boeing's fighter jet workers in the St. Louis area reject a contract offer,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/boeings-fighter-jet-workers-in-the-st-louis-area-reject-a-contract-offer-2025-07-27/,"Boeing Co. expects more than 3,200 union workers at three St. Louis-area plants that produce U.S. fighter jets to strike after they rejected a proposed contract Sunday that included a 20% wage increase over four years. The International Machinists and Aerospace Workers union said the vote by District 837 members was overwhelmingly against the proposed contract. The existing contract was to expire at 11:59 p.m. Central time Sunday, but the union said a “cooling off” period would keep a strike from beginning for another week, until Aug. 4. Union leaders had recommended approving the offer, calling it a “landmark” agreement when it was announced last week. Organizers said then that the offer would improve medical, pension and overtime benefits in addition to pay. The vote came two days before Boeing planned to announce its second quarter earnings, after saying earlier this month that it had delivered 150 commercial airliners and 36 military aircraft and helicopters during the quarter, up from 130 and 26 during the first quarter. Its stock closed Friday at $233.06 a share, up $1.79. The union did not say specifically why members rejected the contract, only that it “fell short of addressing the priorities and sacrifices” of the union’s workers. Last fall, Boeing offered a general wage increase of 38% over four years to end a 53-day strike by 33,000 aircraft workers producing passenger aircraft. “Our members are standing together to demand a contract that respects their work and ensures a secure future,” the union said in a statement. Dan Gillan, general manager and senior Boeing executive in St. Louis, said in a statement that the company is “focused on preparing for a strike.” He described the proposal as “the richest contract offer” ever presented to the St. Louis union. “No talks are scheduled with the union,” said Gillan, who is also vice president for Boeing Air Dominance, the division for the production of several military jets, including the U.S. Navy's Super Hornet, as well as the Air Force's Red Hawk training aircraft. Before you consider Boeing, you'll want to hear this."

Russia starts direct commercial flights between Moscow and Pyongyang,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/russia-starts-direct-commercial-flights-between-moscow-and-pyongyang-2025-07-27/,"MOSCOW (AP) — Russia on Sunday opened a regular air link between Moscow and Pyogyang, a move reflecting increasingly close ties between the two countries. The first flight operated by Russian carrier Nordwind took off from Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport carrying over 400 passengers. Russia's Transport Ministry said there will be one flight a month to meet demand. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who visited North Korea's new Wonsan-Kalma beach resort earlier this month to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, promised to encourage Russian tourists to visit the complex. The resort, which can accommodate nearly 20,000 people, is at the center of Kim’s push to boost tourism to improve his country’s troubled economy. North Korea has been slowly easing the curbs imposed during the pandemic and reopening its borders in phases. But the country hasn’t said if it would fully resume international tourism. Regular flights between Russia’s eastern port city of Vladivostok and Pyongyang reopened in 2023 following a break caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Russia and North Korea have sharply expanded military and other ties in recent years, with Pyongyang supplying weapons and troops to back Russia’s military action in Ukraine."
‘Fantastic Four: First Steps’ scores Marvel's first $100 million box office opening of 2025,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/fantastic-four-first-steps-scores-marvels-first-100-million-box-office-opening-of-2025-2025-07-27/,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Marvel’s first family has finally found box office gold. “The Fantastic Four: First Steps,” the first film about the superheroes made under the guidance of Kevin Feige and the Walt Disney Co., earned $118 million in its first weekend in 4,125 North American theaters, according to studio estimates Sunday. That makes it the fourth biggest opening of the year, behind “A Minecraft Movie,” “Lilo & Stitch” and “Superman,” and the biggest Marvel opening since “Deadpool & Wolverine” grossed $211 million out of the gate last summer. Internationally, “Fantastic Four” made $100 million from 52 territories, adding up to a $218 million worldwide debut. The numbers were within the range the studio was expecting. The film arrived in the wake of another big superhero reboot, James Gunn's “Superman,” which opened three weekends ago and has already crossed $500 million globally. That film, from the other main player in comic book films, DC Studios, took second place with $24.9 million domestically. The box office success of “First Steps” and “Superman” means “the whole notion of superhero fatigue, which has been talked about a lot, can I think be put to rest. I always say it’s bad movie fatigue, not superhero fatigue,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for data firm Comscore. “First Steps” is the latest attempt at bringing the superhuman family to the big screen, following lackluster performances for other versions. The film, based on the original Marvel comics, is set during the 1960s in a retro-futuristic world led by the Fantastic Four, a family of astronauts-turned-superhuman from exposure to cosmic rays during a space mission. The family is made up of Reed Richards (Pedro Pascal), who can stretch his body to incredible lengths; Sue Storm (Vanessa Kirby), who can render herself invisible; Johnny Storm (Joseph Quinn), who transforms into a fiery human torch; and Ben Grimm (Ebon Moss-Bachrach), who possesses tremendous superhuman strength with his stone-like flesh. The movie takes place four years after the family gained powers, during which Reed’s inventions have transformed technology, and Sue’s diplomacy has led to global peace. Both audiences and critics responded positively to the film, which currently has an 88% on Rotten Tomatoes and promising exit poll responses from opening weekend ticket buyers. An estimated 46% of audiences chose to see it on premium screens, including IMAX and other large formats. The once towering Marvel is working to rebuild audience enthusiasm for its films and characters. Its two previous offerings this year did not reach the cosmic box office heights of “Deadpool & Wolverine,"" which made over $1.3 billion, or those of the “Avengers”-era. But critically, the films have been on an upswing since the poorly reviewed “Captain America: Brave New World,” which ultimately grossed $415 million worldwide. “Thunderbolts,"" which jumpstarted the summer movie season, was better received critically but financially is capping out at just over $382 million globally. Like Deadpool and Wolverine, the Fantastic Four characters had been under the banner of 20th Century Fox for years. The studio produced two critically loathed, but decently profitable attempts in the mid-2000s with future Captain America Chris Evans as the Human Torch. In 2015, it tried again (unsuccessfully) with Michael B. Jordan and Miles Teller. They got another chance after Disney's $71 billion acquisition of Fox’s entertainment assets in 2019. The “Fantastic Four's” opening weekend results were a little less than some rival studio projections, Dergarabedian said. Nonetheless, the film is expected to carry movie theater earnings well into August. Holdovers dominated the top 10, but one other newcomer managed to make the chart. The dark romantic comedy “Oh, Hi!” earned $1.1 million from 866 screens. “Jurassic World Rebirth” landed in third place in its fourth weekend with $13 million, followed by “F1” with $6.2 million. The Brad Pitt racing movie also passed $500 million globally. “Smurfs” rounded out the top five with $5.4 million in its second weekend. The box office is currently up over 12% from last year. With final domestic figures being released Monday, this list factors in the estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore: 1. “The Fantastic Four: First Steps,” $118 million. 2. “Superman,” $24.9 million. 3. “Jurassic World Rebirth,” $13 million. 4. “F1: The Movie,” $6.2 million. 5. “Smurfs,” $5.4 million. 6. “I Know What You Did Last Summer,” $5.1 million. 7. “How to Train Your Dragon,” $2.8 million. 8. “Eddington,” $1.7 million. 9. “Saiyaara,” $1.3 million. 10. “Oh, Hi!,” $1.1 million."
PEGA Surges 14%: There's Still Time to Ride This GenAI Innovator,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/pega-surges-14-theres-still-time-to-ride-this-genai-innovator/,"For the second quarter in a row, artificial intelligence (AI) tech stock Pegasystems NASDAQ: PEGA crushed expectations. Shares soared 14% on July 22 as the company eclipsed Wall Street analyst forecasts. The company’s GenAI Blueprint product is gaining serious traction, putting the firm in a position to be a huge winner as AI evolves. Let’s examine Pegasystems’ latest results and explain why investors should pay attention to this stock. In Q2, Pega posted sales of just under $385 million for a growth rate of 9.5%. This surpassed estimates by nearly $40 million. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.28 equated to a growth rate of 7.7%. Analysts predicted the figure would instead decline by 7.7%. The company’s growth rate may seem modest until investors consider Pega’s annual contract value (ACV) growth rate of 14%. ACV calculates the revenue growth that the company can expect to receive on an annual basis through its subscription model. Because it measures the revenue Pega can expect going forward, ACV growth provides a better assessment of the company’s growth trajectory than revenue. The AVC growth rate of the company’s Pega Cloud offering is even more impressive at 25%. The company is switching customers from managing their software themselves (Client Cloud) to Pega managing it (Pega Cloud). This allows for higher margins as customers share the same cloud infrastructure, making it easier to deploy new features that the company can upsell. This ongoing shift helps create more value down the road for shareholders. Overall, Pega’s business is growing much faster now than it was in 2024. The company’s net new AVC adds hit $99 million in the first half of 2025, up 60% compared to H1 2024. So, what’s driving Pega to have all this success? Pega is making it known that its GenAI Blueprint tool is a key driver of success for the company. Blueprint allows users to describe a business problem in simple language, and within minutes, it generates a blueprint for an application that can solve it. Users can then refine this initial blueprint to better meet their needs, with minimal coding required. They can use it to enhance an existing company solution or develop a completely new one for a different problem. Overall, the tool aims to use GenAI to drastically reduce the time a company takes to build an application. That is a compelling proposition, as businesses need to evolve quickly in an ever-changing world. Pega’s sales teams use Blueprint themselves to show prospects customer-specific examples of how it can solve their problems in their first meeting. That makes it much easier for salespeople to secure more meetings and ultimately close the deal. This is why Pega says its growth reflects how “Pega GenAI Blueprint is transforming” its process of gaining customers. It notes that Blueprint is being talked about in every one of its sales campaigns. Pega believes Blueprint’s implementation of GenAI in the application design phase provides a key advantage over other agentic AI competitors. Analysts broadly raised their price targets on Pega after the Q2 results. The MarketBeat consensus price target on Pega is just under $58, nearly equal to the stock’s July 24 closing price. However, the average price target among analysts who updated their forecasts after the July 22 report is $65.60. That number implies around 13% upside in shares. This may not seem groundbreaking, but it is important to remember that the company is in the early stages of its Blueprint rollout. Given the product's success thus far, the longer-term upside opportunity for Pega is likely much larger. Pega notes that research firm Forrester NASDAQ: FORR estimates that two-thirds of global tech spending will go toward legacy systems in 2025. As Blueprint works to transform legacy systems, this shows the huge opportunity that Pega has to capture a percentage of this spending in the long term. GenAI Blueprint is now proving to be more than just a highly interesting product. It is clearly resonating with customers and driving growth for the company. This creates an opportunity for investors to gain a strong upside in Pegasystems' shares. Before you consider Pegasystems, you'll want to hear this."
Retail’s Comeback: 3 High-ROIC Stocks That Could Outshine AI,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/retails-comeback-3-high-roic-stocks-that-could-outshine-ai/,"It’s no secret that the retail sector is now one of the most forgotten areas of the market, whether it is because artificial intelligence (AI) names have taken the bulk of the attention—and capital—in the entire industry, or whether ongoing trade tariff negotiations have pushed investors away from this space in fear of further volatility and uncertainty. The truth is, there are some hidden opportunities with the potential to create the sort of wealth-compounding effects that every investor would love to have in their portfolio, especially considering how inflation and valuation uncertainty have affected the market and economy. Best Buy Inc. NYSE: BBY, Lululemon Athletica Inc. NASDAQ: LULU, and Bath & Body Works Inc. NYSE: BBWI are ideal candidates for multi-year runs and expansion in market capitalization. Why? They each boast strong profitability and the ability to reinvest earnings at high rates. Many consumers—and investors—would likely pass on Best Buy in favor of Amazon.com Inc. NASDAQ: AMZN and other online retailers that offer a wider selection of products and often better prices. Best Buy knows this, and it is one reason why it is quickly pivoting its inventory exposure to include items that customers wouldn’t usually buy online. The company hopes to capitalize on the value of an in-person with appliances, high-end electronics, and smart home devices that consumers want to see, touch, and understand before purchasing. In-store staff provide hands-on education, and showrooms allow consumers to test products, enhancing customer satisfaction and protecting pricing power and brand loyalty. This strategy should enable Best Buy to remain one of the few standing brick-and-mortar retailers still generating sufficient profits. The company's ROIC is hovering around 20%, well above the company’s cost of capital. This matters because annual stock price performance tends to align with the long-term ROIC rate over time, meaning there is sufficient market share and pricing power in the company’s brand to sustain business profitability for the foreseeable future. All this considered, Best Buy is positioned to continue delivering strong performance, especially as many of its peers struggle to adapt. Lululemon's story is one of short-term pain but long-term potential. After President Trump announced a wave of tariffs targeting most of the Asian countries from which the United States sources its apparel materials, Lululemon shares sold off significantly, trading at a dismal 53% of their 52-week high levels. This created a massive gap to be filled on the upside. While the headlines spooked retail investors, institutional sentiment tells a different story: the risk-to-reward ratio now favors the buyers. Over the past month, Lululemon’s short interest has declined by over 4%, showing some signs of bearish capitulation and a new path for higher prices. Major institutional investors have already taken action on this setup opportunity. For example, Robeco Institutional Asset Management significantly increased its holdings by as much as 55%, bringing its position to nearly $60 million. This aligns with Wall Street analysts issuing a consensus price target of $335.9 for LULU stock, implying the company can rally by as much as 50% from its current trading price. And that is not even assuming it will retest its previous 52-week highs. At the core of this buy-the-dip thesis is the company’s ROIC, which sits around 29%, confirming Lululemon's ability to maintain high margins and strong brand value, even during challenging macro periods. For long-term investors, the recent sell-off may be a gift. Wall Street analysts forecast that Bath & Body Works could generate up to $2.08 in earnings per share (EPS) for the fourth quarter of 2025, a massive jump from today’s reported 49-cent EPS. As most investors already know, stock price action typically follows EPS growth, but the story goes deeper than that. Bath & Body Works also generates up to 29.5% in ROIC, meaning that this brand recognition and market share could allow the company to compound on its value and deliver outsized returns, following the Best Buy model of capitalizing on the in-person shopping experience. Bath & Body Works thrives on sensory-based shopping, selling products customers want to see, smell, and feel before buying. The brand has cultivated deep consumer loyalty and continues to drive innovation in fragrance, skincare, and home products. Institutional buyers have taken note, with OLD National Bancorp recently boosting its stake by 8.5%, bringing its total holding to over $11 million. This quiet vote of confidence is worth paying attention to, especially with the stock trading at relatively low multiples compared to its historical averages. In addition, the recent appointment of Daniel Heaf, a former Nike executive, as CEO further signals a shift toward operational excellence and modern retail strategy and could drive future profitability even higher.

Homebuilding Headwinds Putting These 3 Stocks Under Pressure,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/homebuilding-headwinds-putting-these-3-stocks-under-pressure/,"The S&P 500 has experienced a broad rally over the last three months, but not every sector has participated in the uptrend. In fact, some sectors have been struggling in the face of stiff headwinds from regulators and macroenvironmental factors. Homebuilders have yet to join the market rally because the housing market remains stifled by high mortgage rates, rising construction costs, and a price growth contagion emanating out of previously hot markets. Today, we’ll examine the myriad factors putting pressure on housing stocks and three companies investors might want to avoid while their margins are being threatened. You might have read that last section and thought, “Well, other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how was the play?” However, homebuilder headwinds continue to intensify as consumers expect high prices and elevated mortgage rates to persist longer than initially anticipated. D.R. Horton Inc. NYSE: DHI boosted the sector this week by beating top and bottom line earnings expectations, but the numbers still shrank year over year, and this brief bump could be a good exit point for the following three companies. NVR Inc. NYSE: NVR comprises three brands: Ryan Homes, NVHomes, and Heartland Homes, which focus on detached homes, condominiums, and townhouses. It operates in 18 states, including the Midwest and Southeast, where prices have recently shown weakness. It also has a significant presence in D.C., which experienced a slowdown in June. NVR runs an asset-light business model by outsourcing land development, but it also remains at the mercy of developers passing on tariffs. New immigration restrictions will also affect NVR’s subcontractors, and the company will likely need to increase wages to compensate. NVR posted a significant EPS miss in its Q1 2025 earnings report, and analysts are expecting more YOY declines in this week’s Q2 report. Lennar Corp. NYSE: LEN focuses on a high-volume operation, which leaves it vulnerable to macro and regulatory pressures. Since Lennar’s strategy requires a high number of homes to be built and sold each year, any type of disruption can severely hurt margins and cause a cascade of delays. Tariffs can be especially damaging to high-volume sellers like Lennar, as the company‘s ability to fully pass these costs onto buyers is limited by splintered demand. LEN shares soared 8% following the DHI earnings release, but this sympathy rally could be short-lived as Lennar’s Q2 earnings report showed a 4.4% drop in YOY revenue, and the stock is still down nearly 13% in 2025. KB Home Inc. NYSE: KBH specializes in land development and housing for first-time buyers or first-time move-up buyers, which is, unfortunately, the customer base most likely to feel the sting from high prices and mortgage rates. The company’s Built To Order strategy offers unique customization and a personalized experience; however, this model may struggle with the HAI under 100, as customization matters less to buyers than affordability. KBH has also already reported Q2 earnings, and saw revenue drop an eye-popping 10.5% YOY. Several analysts dropped their price targets following the June release, including Wells Fargo and Barclays, which cut their price estimates below the current market price.

Passengers flee smoking jet on emergency slide after apparent landing gear problem at Denver airport,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/passengers-flee-smoking-jet-on-emergency-slide-after-apparent-landing-gear-problem-at-denver-airport-2025-07-27/,"Passengers slid down an emergency slide of a smoking jet at Denver International Airport due to a possible problem with the plane's landing gear, authorities said. American Airlines Flight 3023 reported a “possible landing gear incident” during its departure from Denver on Saturday afternoon, the Federal Aviation Administration said. The problem involved an aircraft tire, the Fort Worth, Texas-based airline said in a statement. The Boeing 737 MAX 8 carrying 173 passengers and six crew members was on its way to Miami International Airport, American said. Video aired by local media showed people sliding down the inflatable chute near the front of the plane while clutching luggage and small children. Some passengers, including at least one adult carrying a young child, tripped at the end of the slide and fell onto the concrete runway. Passengers were then taken to the terminal by bus. Shay Armistead, a 17-year-old from Minturn, Colorado, described a chaotic scene. After hearing a loud “boom,” the plane “started to violently shake and we were drifting to the left side of the runway,” Armistead told The Associated Press in an interview. Armistead and her teammates on a ski racing team were on their way from Colorado to Chile when it happened. “I started grabbing my friend’s hands, I was like ‘Oh my God,’ and then they slammed on the brakes, and we all like went forward and they finally brought the plane to a stop,” she said. “It was just terrifying.” One of the passengers was taken to a hospital with a minor injury, American Airlines said in its statement. Five people were evaluated for injuries at the scene but did not require hospitalization, airport officials said. “About halfway to takeoff speed, we hear a big bang and a pop,” passenger Shaun Williams told KUSA-TV. “The pilot immediately started abort procedures for taking off. You could feel him start to hit the brakes.” Firefighters extinguished a fire on the aircraft, the Denver Fire Department said. “All customers and crew deplaned safely, and the aircraft was taken out of service to be inspected by our maintenance team,” American said. In a statement, the FAA said it's investigating. Armistead said she's thankful for everyone who helped her and the other passengers, and grateful that she's safe. “You've just got to appreciate what you're given, and I'm so grateful that it wasn't worse,"" Armistead said. ___ This story corrects the spelling of a passenger’s name.

Here's how a major Mexican tomato exporter is affected by Trump’s 17% tariff,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/heres-how-a-major-mexican-tomato-exporter-is-affected-by-trumps-17-tariff-2025-07-26/,"AJUCHITLAN, Mexico (AP) — The Trump administration’s decision to impose a 17% duty on fresh tomatoes imported from Mexico has created a dilemma for the country providing more tomatoes to U.S. consumers than any other. The import tax that began July 14 is just the latest protectionist move by an administration that has threatened dozens of countries with tariffs, including its critical trading partner Mexico. It comes as the Mexican government tries to also negotiate its way out of a 30% general tariff scheduled to take effect Aug. 1. While the impacts of the tomato tariff are still in their infancy, a major grower and exporter in central Mexico shows how a tariff targeting a single product can destabilize the sector. Green tomato plants stretch upward row after row in sprawling high-tech greenhouses covering nearly six acres in the central state of Queretaro, among the top 10 tomato producing states in Mexico. Climate controlled and pest free, Veggie Prime’s greenhouses in Ajuchitlan send some 100 tons of fresh tomatoes every week to Mastronardi Produce. The Canadian company is the leading distributor of fresh tomatoes in the U.S. with clients that include Costco and Walmart. Moisés Atri, Veggie Prime’s export director, says they’ve been exporting tomatoes to the U.S. for 13 years and their substantial investment and the cost to produce their tomatoes won’t allow them to make any immediate changes. They’re also contractually obligated to sell everything they produce to Mastronardi until 2026. “None of us (producers) can afford it,"" Atri said. ""We have to approach our client to adjust the prices because we’re nowhere near making that kind of profit.” In the tariff’s first week, Veggie Prime ate the entire charge. In the second, its share of the new cost lowered when its client agreed to increase the price of their tomatoes by 10%. The 56-year-old Atri hopes that Mastronardi will eventually pass all of the tariff’s cost onto its retail clients. Experts say the tariff could cause a 5% to 10% drop in tomato exports, which last year amounted to more than $3 billion for Mexico. The Mexican Association of Tomato Producers says the industry generates some 500,000 jobs. Juan Carlos Anaya, director general of the consulting firm Grupo Consultor de Mercados Agrícolas, said a drop in tomato exports, which last year amounted to more than 2 billion tons, could lead to the loss of some 200,000 jobs When the Trump administration announced the tariff, the Commerce Department justified it as a measure to protect U.S. producers from artificially cheap Mexican imports. California and Florida growers that produce about 11 million tons would stand to benefit most, though most of that production is for processed tomatoes. Experts believe the U.S. would find it difficult to replace Mexico’s fresh tomato imports. Atri and other producers are waiting for a scheduled review of the measure in two months, when the U.S. heads into fall and fresh tomato production there begins to decline. In reaction to the tariff, the Mexican government has floated the idea of looking for other, more stable, international markets. Mexican Agriculture Secretary Julio Berdegué said Thursday that the government is looking at possibilities like Japan, but producers quickly cast doubt on that idea, noting the tomatoes would have to be sent by plane, raising the cost even more. Atri said the company is starting to experiment with peppers, to see if they would provide an option at scale. President Claudia Sheinbaum said recently her administration would survey tomato growers to figure out what support they need, especially small producers who are already feeling the effects of a drop of more than 10% in the price of tomatoes domestically over fears there will be a glut in Mexico.

US-EU deal sets a 15% tariff on most goods and averts the threat of a trade war with a global shock,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trumps-meeting-with-a-key-european-official-comes-as-his-tariff-deadline-nears-2025-07-26/,"EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) — The United States and the European Union agreed on Sunday to a trade framework setting a 15% tariff on most goods, staving off — at least for now — far higher import duties on both sides that might have sent shock waves through economies around the globe. The sweeping announcement came after President Donald Trump and European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen met briefly at Trump's Turnberry golf course in Scotland. Their private sit-down culminated months of bargaining, with the White House deadline Friday nearing for imposing punishing tariffs on the EU's 27 member countries. “It was a very interesting negotiation. I think it’s going to be great for both parties,” Trump said. The agreement, he said, was “a good deal for everybody” and “a giant deal with lots of countries.” Von der Leyen said the deal “will bring stability, it will bring predictability, that’s very important for our businesses on both sides of the Atlantic.” As with other, recent tariff agreements that Trump announced with countries including Japan and the United Kingdom, some major details remain pending in this one. Trump said the EU had agreed to buy some $750 billion worth of U.S. energy and invest $600 billion more than it already is in America — as well as make a major military equipment purchase. He said tariffs “for automobiles and everything else will be a straight across tariff of 15%” and meant that U.S. exporters ”have the opening up of all of the European countries.” Von der Leyen said the 15% tariffs were “across the board, all inclusive” and that “indeed, basically the European market is open.” At a later news conference away from Turnberry, she said the $750 billion in additional U.S. energy purchases was actually over the next three years — and would help ease the dependence on natural gas from Russia among the bloc’s countries. “When the European Union and the United States work together as partners, the benefits are tangible,” Von der Leyen said, noting that the agreement “stabilized on a single, 15% tariff rate for the vast majority of EU exports"" including cars, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals. “15% is a clear ceiling,” she said. But von der Leyen also clarified that such a rate wouldn’t apply to everything, saying that both sides agreed on “zero for zero tariffs on a number of strategic products,” like all aircraft and component parts, certain chemicals, certain generic drugs, semiconductor equipment, some agricultural products, natural resources and critical raw materials. It is unclear if alcohol will be included in that list. “And we will keep working to add more products to this list,” she said, while also stressing that the “framework means the figures we have just explained to the public, but, of course, details have to be sorted out. And that will happen over the next weeks.” In the meantime, there will be work to do on other fronts. Von der Leyen had a mandate to negotiate because the European Commission handles trade for member countries. But the Commission must now present the deal to member states and EU lawmakers, who will ultimately decide whether or not to approve it. Before their meeting began, Trump pledged to change what he characterized as “a very one-sided transaction, very unfair to the United States.” ""I think both sides want to see fairness,” the Republican president told reporters. Von der Leyen said the U.S. and EU combined have the world's largest trade volume, encompassing hundreds of millions of people and trillions of dollars and added that Trump was “known as a tough negotiator and dealmaker."" “But fair,” Trump said. Trump has spent months threatening most of the world with large tariffs in hopes of shrinking major U.S. trade deficits with many key trading partners. More recently, he had hinted that any deal with the EU would have to “buy down” a tariff rate of 30% that had been set to take effect. But during his comments before the agreement was announced, the president was asked if he'd be willing to accept tariff rates lower than 15%, and he said “no.” Their meeting came after Trump played golf for the second straight day at Turnberry, this time with a group that included sons Eric and Donald Jr. In addition to negotiating deals, Trump's five-day visit to Scotland is built around golf and promoting properties bearing his name. A small group of demonstrators at the course waved American flags and raised a sign criticizing British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who plans his own Turnberry meeting with Trump on Monday. Other voices could be heard cheering and chanting “Trump! Trump!” as he played nearby. On Tuesday, Trump will be in Aberdeen, in northeastern Scotland, where his family has another golf course and is opening a third next month. The president and his sons plan to help cut the ribbon on the new course. The U.S. and EU seemed close to a deal earlier this month, but Trump instead threatened the 30% tariff rate. The deadline for the Trump administration to begin imposing tariffs has shifted in recent weeks but is now firm and coming Friday, the administration insists. “No extensions, no more grace periods. Aug. 1, the tariffs are set, they’ll go into place, Customs will start collecting the money and off we go,"" U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told “Fox News Sunday"" before the EU deal was announced. He added, however, that even after that “people can still talk to President Trump. I mean, he’s always willing to listen.” Without an agreement, the EU said it was prepared to retaliate with tariffs on hundreds of American products, ranging from beef and auto parts to beer and Boeing airplanes. If Trump eventually followed through on his threat of tariffs against Europe, meanwhile, it could have made everything from French cheese and Italian leather goods to German electronics and Spanish pharmaceuticals more expensive in the United States. “I think it’s great that we made a deal today, instead of playing games and maybe not making a deal at all,” Trump said. “I think it’s the biggest deal ever made.” ___ Associated Press writers Seung Min Kim in Cincinnati and Samuel Petrequin in London contributed to this report."
Allianz Life confirms data breach affecting majority of 1.4M US customers,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/allianz-life-confirms-data-breach-affecting-majority-of-14m-us-customers-2025-07-26/,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Hackers gained access to personal data on the majority of the 1.4 million customers of Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America, the company confirmed Saturday. Minneapolis-based Allianz Life, a subsidiary of Munich, Germany-based Allianz SE, said the data breach happened on July 16 when a “malicious threat actor” gained access to a third-party, cloud-based system used by the company. “The threat actor was able to obtain personally identifiable data related to the majority of Allianz Life’s customers, financial professionals, and select Allianz Life employees, using a social engineering technique,” Allianz Life said in a statement. ""We took immediate action to contain and mitigate the issue and notified the FBI."" The company said its own systems were not accessed, just the third-party's platform. Allianz Life said its investigation is ongoing and that the company has begun reaching out to the impacted individuals. It said the incident involves only Allianz Life in the U.S., not other Allianz corporate entities. In the case of data breaches, a “social engineering technique” usually involves using trickery to gain access. Spokesman Brett Weinberg said he couldn't provide details because they are still investigating. Allianz Life also reported the breach to multiple other authorities, including the Maine Attorney General's Office. A filing on the agency's website said the company discovered the breach the day after it happened, and that it will be offering those affected 24 months of identity theft protection and credit monitoring. Allianz Life was known as North American Life and Casualty until it was acquired by German conglomerate Allianz SE in 1979 and changed its name to Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America. It has nearly 2,000 employees in U.S., with the majority working in Minnesota, according to its website. It is one of five North American subsidiaries of the Munich-based global financial services group Allianz SE, which says it serves more than 125 million customers worldwide."
The Tea app was intended to help women date safely. Then it got hacked,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/the-tea-app-was-intended-to-help-women-date-safely-then-it-got-hacked-2025-07-26/,"Tea, a provocative dating app designed to let women anonymously ask or warn each other about men they'd encountered, rocketed to the top spot on the U.S. Apple App Store this week. On Friday, the company behind the app confirmed it had been hacked: Thousands of images, including selfies, were leaked online. “We have engaged third-party cybersecurity experts and are working around the clock to secure our systems,” San Francisco-based Tea Dating Advice Inc. said in a statement. 404 Media, which earlier reported the breach, said it was 4Chan users who discovered an exposed database that “allowed anyone to access the material” from Tea. The app and the breach highlight the fraught nature of seeking romance in the age of social media. Here's what to know: Tea founder Sean Cook, a software engineer who previously worked at Salesforce and Shutterfly, says on the app's website that he founded the company in 2022 after witnessing his own mother's “terrifying'' experiences. Cook said they included unknowingly dating men with criminal records and being ”catfished'' — deceived by men using false identities. Tea markets itself as a safe way for women to anonymously vet men they might meet on dating apps such as Tinder or Bumble — ensuring that the men are who they say they are, not criminals and not already married or in a relationship. ""It's like people have their own little Yelp pages,'' said Aaron Minc, whose Cleveland firm, Minc Law, specializes in cases involving online defamation and harassment. In an Apple Store review, one woman wrote that she used a Tea search to investigate a man she'd begun talking to and discovered “over 20 red flags, including serious allegations like assault and recording women without their consent.'' She said she cut off communication. ”I can't imagine how things could've gone had I not known,"" she wrote. A surge in social media attention over the past week pushed Tea to the No. 1 spot on Apple's U.S. App Store as of July 24, according to Sensor Tower, a research firm. In the seven days from July 17-23, Tea downloads shot up 525% compared to the week before. Tea said in an Instagram post that it had reached 4 million users. A female columnist for The Times of London newspaper, who signed into the app, on Thursday called Tea a “man-shaming site'' and complained that ”this is simply vigilante justice, entirely reliant on the scruples of anonymous women. With Tea on the scene, what man would ever dare date a woman again?'' “Over the last couple of weeks, we’ve gotten hundreds of calls on it. It’s blown up,” attorney Minc said. ""People are upset. They're getting named. They’re getting shamed.’’ In 1996, Congress passed legislation protecting websites and apps from liability for things posted by their users. But the users can be sued for spreading ”false and defamatory'' information, Minc said. In May, however, a federal judge in Illinois threw out an invasion-of-privacy lawsuit by a man who’d been criticized by women in the Facebook chat group “Are We Dating the Same Guy,″ Bloomberg Law reported. State privacy laws could offer another avenue for bringing legal action against someone who posted your photograph or other personal information in a harmful way, Minc said. In its statement, Tea reported that about 72,000 images were leaked online, including 13,000 images of selfies or photo identification that users submitted during account verification. Another 59,000 images that were publicly viewable in the app from posts, comments and direct messages were also accessed, according to the company's statement. No email addresses or phone numbers were exposed, the company said, and the breach only affects users who signed up before February 2024. “At this time, there is no evidence to suggest that additional user data was affected. Protecting tea users’ privacy and data is our highest priority,” Tea said. It said users did not need to change their passwords or delete their accounts. ""All data has been secured.'' Lawyer Minc said he was not surprised to see Tea get targeted. “These sites get attacked,'' he said. ”They create enemies. They put targets on themselves where people want to go after them.'' ."
"Comic-Con salutes James Gunn and gets first looks at 'Coyote vs. Acme,' and new 'Star Trek' forays",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/comic-con-goes-interstellar-with-project-hail-mary-star-trek-updates-2025-07-26/,"SAN DIEGO (AP) — Director James Gunn got an ovation from thousands for “Superman” in the most fitting place of all — Comic-Con. Among the highlights of day three of the San Diego pop culture spectacular was a sincere tribute to the director who's now helming Warner Bros.' DC Comics screen universe, even if John Cena played it for laughs. It came at a panel on the forthcoming Season 2 of DC's HBO series “The Peacemaker,” and Cena appeared in the title character's full comic costume and grand helmet, leading the legions in the kind of exaggerated drama he was perfect at provoking in his wrestling days. It was Gunn's first time in front of a crowd in the weeks since “Superman” was released and has earned more than $200 million in North America. “Today has been the most fun day I’ve had in a year,"" Gunn told the crowd at the end of the session. “Superman” was his first film as captain of the DC ship, but his first foray was in 2021's “The Suicide Squad,” which spawned the “Peacemaker” TV series. The crowd saw scenes from Season 2, which arrives in August and sees Cena entering another dimension where he gets to be a cool version of the hero instead of the often pained and pathetic version that's typical of the character. Some characters from “Superman” will make appearances. That panel followed another rousing showcase in Hall H, where star Ryan Gosling and directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller showed scenes from their forthcoming science-comedy space adventure “Project Hail Mary.” The scenes from the film set for release in March included a look at Rocky, a faceless, stone-shaped alien who becomes Gosling's unlikely partner in an attempt to save the universe from ecological disaster. Wile E. Coyote is getting his day in court — and theaters. The stars of “Coyote vs. Acme” delivered a rousing presentation Saturday morning of a movie that at one point wasn’t going to be released but is now bound for theaters in August 2026. The underdog story – both of the movie and Coyote — was a running theme of the panel. But rather than direct ire at Warner Bros., the real-world studio that shelved the project, the panel focused on the fictional Acme Corp. “This is purely an Acme decision … and I am saying this for legal purposes,” moderator Paul Scheer said at the start of the panel. The movie is a hybrid of animation and live action and is based on a 1990 New Yorker article that satirized a legal complaint filed by Coyote against Acme, the maker of the TNT, detonators, rocket shoes, catapults and other products that consistently backfire during the Coyote’s fruitless attempts to catch the Roadrunner. Laughter filled Hall H as some 6,000 watched a montage of Coyote being blown up, flattened and falling into chasms in a scene set to Johnny Cash’s cover of “Hurt.” Coyote is replaying the moments in his lair when an ad for a personal injury lawyer appears on TV. They also played six minutes of the movie, including a scene of opening statements in the case in which Coyote's lawyer, Will Forte, accidentally unleashes a rocket skate into the courtroom, setting Coyote and the judge's robes on fire. Cena plays a slick Acme lawyer who wins over the jury, which includes a cartoon character, quickly. Forte said he didn't think the movie would ever get to audiences. “I’m pretty speechless. You think back to the journey that this movie has taken. I had kind of given up hope at a certain point,” Forte said. At one point, his comments were interrupted by a man playing an Acme lawyer who stormed into Hall H with cease-and-desist letters. Director Dave Green said the movie conforms to famed animator Chuck Jones’ rules for the struggle between the Coyote and Roadrunner, which include the bird always staying on the road and the Coyote being ultimately more humiliated than hurt when he falls, is crushed or gets blown up by TNT. The movie, which features cameos from numerous Looney Tunes characters like Foghorn Leghorn, Tweety and Bugs Bunny, will be released on Aug. 28, 2026. Ketchup Entertainment teamed up with Warner Bros. on the film and in the release of “The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie.” Also on Saturday morning, the cast of “Bad Guys 2” teasing new footage from the movie and describing how they recorded their characters. Marc Maron, who plays Snake, joked he asked to be tied up as he performed his lines on the floor. “The depth of the character should read a little more this time,” he said. The film, based on the graphic novel series by Aaron Blabey, introduces a new crew of animal criminals, the Bad Girls played by Danielle Brooks, Natasha Lyonne and Maria Bakalova. Paramount showed off its first footage from a new series, “Starfleet Academy,” which stars Holly Hunter and Paul Giamatti. The show follows cadets as they go through training, with Hunter serving as chancellor of the academy. It will arrive in 2026, the 60th anniversary year of the original “Star Trek” series. Paramount+'s other “Star Trek” series, “Strange New Worlds,” also shared updates. The crew of the USS Enterprise are being turned into puppets for an upcoming “Strange New Worlds” episode, Paramount announced Saturday. The puppets will be created by Jim Henson's Creature Shop. Season 3, which follows the adventures of the Enterprise under the command of Capt. Christopher Pike, is being released on Paramount+. An estimated 135,000 people — many in costumes — are expected to attend Comic-Con 2025, which runs through Sunday in downtown San Diego. So far, fans have gotten previews of “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2,”the upcoming FX series “Alien: Earth,”“Tron: Ares” and “Predator: Badlands,” which will be in theaters in November."
Trump says Japan will invest $550 billion in US at his direction. It may not be a sure thing,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-says-japan-will-invest-550-billion-in-us-at-his-direction-it-may-not-be-a-sure-thing-2025-07-26/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is bragging that Japan has given him, as part of a new trade framework, $550 billion to invest in the United States. It's an astonishing figure, but still subject to negotiation and perhaps not the sure thing he's portraying. ""Japan is putting up $550 billion in order to lower their tariffs a little bit,"" Trump said Thursday. “They put up, as you could call it, seed money. Let’s call it seed money.” He said 90% of any profits from the money invested would go to the U.S. even if Japan had put up the funds. “It’s not a loan or anything, it’s a signing bonus,” the Republican president said, on the trade framework that lowered his threatened tariff from 25% to 15%, including on autos. A White House official said the terms are being negotiated and nothing has been formalized in writing. The official, who insisted on anonymity to detail the terms of the talks, suggested the goal was for the $550 billion fund to make investments at Trump's direction. The sum is significant: It would represent more than 10% of Japan's entire gross domestic product. The Japan External Trade Organization estimates that direct investment into the U.S. economy topped $780 billion in 2023. It is unclear the degree to which the $550 billion could represent new investment or flow into existing investment plans. What the trade framework announced Tuesday has achieved is a major talking point for the Trump administration. The president has claimed to have brought trillions of dollars in new investment into the U.S., though the impact of those commitments have yet to appear in the economic data for jobs, construction spending or manufacturing output. The framework also enabled Trump to say other countries are agreeing to have their goods taxed, even if some of the cost of those taxes are ultimately passed along to U.S. consumers. On the $550 billion, Japan's Cabinet Office said it involves the credit facility of state-affiliated financial institutions, such as Japan Bank for International Cooperation. Further details would be decided based on the progress of the investment deals. Japanese trade negotiator Ryosei Akazawa, upon returning to Japan, did not discuss the terms of the $550 billion investment. Akazawa said he believes a written joint statement is necessary, at least on working levels, to avoid differences. He is not thinking about a legally binding trade pact. The U.S. apparently released its version of the deal while Japanese officials were on their return flight home. “If we find differences of understanding, we may have to point them out and say ‘that’s not what we discussed,’” Akazawa said. The U.S. administration said the fund would be invested in critical minerals, pharmaceuticals, computer chips and shipbuilding, among other industries. It has said Japan will also buy 100 airplanes from Boeing and rice from U.S. farmers as part of the framework, which Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said would be evaluated every three months. “And if the president is unhappy, then they will boomerang back to the 25% tariff rates, both on cars and the rest of their products. And I can tell you that I think at 25, especially in cars, the Japanese economy doesn’t work,” Bessent told Fox News' “The Ingraham Angle.” Akazawa denied that Bessent’s quarterly review was part of the negotiations. “In my past eight trips to the United States during which I held talks with the president and the ministers,"" Akazawa said. “I have no recollection of discussing how we ensure the implementation of the latest agreement between Japan and the United States.” He said it would cause major disruptions to the economy and administrative processes if the rates first rise to 25% as scheduled on Aug. 1 and then drop to 15%. “We definitely want to avoid that and I believe that is the understanding shared by the U.S. side,” he said. On buying U.S. rice, Japanese officials have said they have no plans to raise the current 770,000-ton “minimum access” cap to import more from America. Agricultural Minister Shinjiro Koizumi said Japan will decide whether to increase U.S. rice imports and that Japan is not committed to a fixed quota.

"Modi joins Maldives independence day celebrations, signals easing tensions amid China rivalry",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/modi-joins-maldives-independence-day-celebrations-signals-easing-tensions-amid-china-rivalry-2025-07-26/,"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi Saturday participated Saturday in the 60th Independence Day celebrations of the Maldives, concluding a two-day visit to the island nation. During the trip, Modi also announced financial assistance and formally launched talks on a proposed free trade agreement. The two-day visit was seen as crucial to India’s ambition to control the seas and shipping routes of the Indian Ocean in a race with its regional rival China. It signaled a thaw in diplomatic tensions that followed the election of pro-China Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu in 2023. Modi joined a distinguished gathering at Republic Square in the capital, Malé, where a military parade and cultural performances marked the anniversary of the Maldives gaining independence from British rule in 1965. On Friday, following talks with Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu, Modi announced a credit line of $565 million to support development projects in the Maldives. The visit coincided with the anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between the two nations in 1965. It also saw the start of talks on a free trade agreement. The two leaders oversaw the exchange of signed agreements to cooperate in sectors such as fisheries, health, tourism and digital development. Modi also handed over dozens of heavy vehicles donated by India to strengthen the Maldives’ defense forces. The Maldives — an archipelago nation strategically located in the Indian Ocean — is a focal point in the growing geopolitical rivalry between India and China. Tensions grew when Muizzu, who favored closer ties with China, was elected in 2023 after defeating the India-friendly incumbent Ibrahim Mohamed Solih. Leading up to the election, Muizzu had promised to expel Indian soldiers deployed in the Maldives to help with humanitarian assistance. Last year New Delhi replaced dozens of its soldiers in the Maldives with civilian experts. Measures by Modi to promote tourism in India’s Lakshadweep archipelago, off the southwestern coast of the Indian mainland, also sparked anger from Maldivians, who saw it as a move to lure Indian tourists away from their country. Indian celebrities then called for a tourism boycott of the Maldives. Tensions escalated last year when President Muizzu visited China before India, a move widely interpreted in New Delhi as a diplomatic snub. On his return, Muizzu outlined plans to reduce the Maldives’ reliance on India for medical services, pharmaceuticals, and essential imports such as food staples. Relations started to improve after Muizzu attended Modi’s swearing-in ceremony for a third five-year term last year. Muizzu has since toned down his anti-Indian rhetoric, and official contacts with New Delhi have intensified amid growing concern about the Maldives’ economy. During a visit by Muizzu to India last October, India pledged financial support to the Maldives, which has been struggling with debt. This included $100 million in short-term government loans and agreeing to a $400 million currency swap to help stabilize the Maldivian economy. India has long been a key development partner for the Maldives. However, the island nation has also deepened ties with China, joining its Belt and Road Initiative in 2013 to build infrastructure and expand trade — part of Beijing’s broader effort to increase its global influence."
Crypto Skeptics Can Still Win Big With These Risk-Limiting ETFs,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/crypto-skeptics-can-still-win-big-with-these-risk-limiting-etfs/,"Fresh off all-time highs above $120,000, Bitcoin has had an incredible run in the last year with a price increase above 80%. The potential for a more favorable regulatory environment may have helped drive these gains and could also inspire once-cautious investors to take the crypto plunge. Still, there are plenty of reasons to be hesitant about cryptocurrency—volatility, user and programming risks for various exchanges and platforms, and security concerns are all still present, among other things. Investors hesitant to make direct, unprotected cryptocurrency investments but interested in the recent rally might consider a risk-limiting crypto ETF. Besides providing some insulation from the cryptocurrency itself by allowing exposure indirectly through shares of a fund, these vehicles may combine a crypto focus with something more stable from the traditional investment landscape. Further, all of the funds below have significantly outperformed the S&P 500 year-to-date (YTD), showing that these risk-mitigating strategies can still pay off. The Fidelity Crypto Industry and Digital Payments ETF NASDAQ: FDIG has been one of the better-performing crypto-adjacent ETFs in recent quarters. FDIG does not invest in cryptocurrency or related futures but rather holds a basket of stocks from both the U.S. and international markets. While many of these companies are involved in the cryptocurrency space—think of crypto exchanges like Coinbase Global Inc. NASDAQ: COIN and digital asset miners like MARA Holdings Inc. NASDAQ: MARA—others are more broadly centered around digital payments or blockchain, providing some alternate exposure. FDIG is reasonably diversified, with around 52 separate holdings that are spaced across the small-, mid-, and large-cap categories. Coinbase is the single largest security holding, but most other names are fairly evenly weighted. FDIG may appeal for its passive income potential, as it provides a dividend yield of 0.95%. This may help make the expense ratio of 0.40% even more compelling, despite the fact that it's already lower than many other crypto funds. FDIG has returned about 24% YTD, ahead of the S&P 500's 8.7% over the same period. An Ethereum-focused fund, the Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF NYSEARCA: AETH, aims to minimize the impact of volatility by using U.S. Treasuries during volatile periods. AETH is an actively managed fund that pivots between two different approaches: when fund managers believe momentum is strong, AETH holds exclusively CME Ether Futures, and when the market becomes volatile or uncertain, AETH shifts entirely to U.S. Treasuries. The fund's provider, Bitwise, asserts that a rotational strategy like this can outperform buy-and-hold crypto funds by capturing gains achieved during ether rallies while limiting downside risk during turbulent times. AETH's recent performance would suggest that this is accurate; the fund has a YTD return of 32.6%, while a traditional competitor investing solely in ether futures like the ARK 21Shares Active Ethereum Futures Strategy ETF NYSEARCA: ARKZ has returned just 7.7% in the same period. Investors should expect to spend more in fees for the active management component of AETH, which charges an expense ratio of 0.89%. ARKZ, by contrast, is somewhat lower at 0.70%. However, the added security of a Treasuries component—and the improved performance—may make AETH worth the higher cost. The One+One Bitcoin and Ether ETF NASDAQ: OOQB is a unique type of leveraged investment that offers both 100% Nasdaq-100 exposure and 100% Bitcoin exposure via futures. As a leveraged play, investors may wish to focus on short-term trades of OOQB. This fund provides an interesting mix of risk and risk mitigation. On one hand, a 2x leverage such as this is inherently higher-risk than traditional, non-leveraged ETFs. However, by balancing out Bitcoin futures exposure, typically seen as higher risk than traditional index-based funds, with a group of stalwart performers like those from the Nasdaq-100, OOQB offers some protection relative to a pure-play Bitcoin investment. OOQB is one of the newest cryptocurrency ETFs available, having only launched in February 2025. As such, a YTD performance metric is unavailable for this fund. However, in the last three months, it has returned more than 50%, with a relatively modest expense ratio of 0.85%. Keep in mind, though, as above, that the fund may not be intended for buy-and-hold investors but rather for those seeking targeted short-term exposure to Bitcoin with some protection from synchronous Nasdaq-100 access.

3 Discounted Steel Stocks You Can DCA Into Today,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/3-discounted-steel-stocks-you-can-dca-into-today/,"Most investors can agree that the industrial sector's current state is one of neglect, as most of the attention (and capital) has shifted to the more exciting stories in the artificial intelligence race in today’s market. This means that a potential rotation could be triggered in the future, no matter how vague this future may be. One of the best ways for investors to start exposing their portfolios to setups like these is to implement something called dollar-cost averaging (DCA). This means that investors will choose both a set date and amount to invest in a single name or a basket of names in an area like the industrial sector, which shows significant upside potential and a gap to fill. Of course, choosing the best names in this area can significantly improve the results of a DCA strategy, which is where names like Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. NYSE: CLF, Commercial Metals Co. NYSE: CMC, and even Steel Dynamics Inc. NASDAQ: STLD come into play. There are obvious reasons why investors should consider these stocks for their DCA basket, as they could offer the best of both safety and upside potential in the coming months. Considering the entire steel industry, all peers are trading at an average of 90% of their 52-week high prices. This is why Cleveland-Cliffs stock should be viewed as a potential catch-up play, as it is currently the outlier, trading at only 68% of its 52-week high. Next is the recently bullish view coming out of Wall Street, where Phillip Gibbs, an analyst from KeyCorp, decided to boost his rating on Cleveland-Cliffs stock from Sector Weight to Overweight. Not only did the sentiment improve for this stock, but its current perceived valuation also improved. This analyst decided to stand out of the pack and place a $14 per share price target on Cleveland-Cliffs stock, which, compared to today’s prices would mean not only flirting with 52-week high levels and closing that gap to peers, but also an approximate 40% upside potential for investors to expose their portfolios to in a DCA strategy. Another gauge to justify this view for Cleveland-Cliffs stock can be taken from what institutional buyers are doing with it. As of late July 2025, those from JB Capital decided to boost their holdings in the stock by 14.6% to net their position at $1.2 million. The fact that this isn’t the largest holding speaks to the current interest in slowly building a bigger position through DCA. Commercial Metals stock stands out due to its exposure to aluminum and steel production in the United States and China. This makes it an immediately valuable business opportunity that diversifies the ongoing risks and uncertainties stemming from the trade tariff negotiations between the two countries. Investors can expect big things from this fundamental setup, especially as Wall Street analysts now see the company reporting up to $1.25 in earnings per share (EPS) for the fourth quarter of 2025, in other words, a net increase of 70% from today’s reported $0.74 EPS. Now, most investors know that where EPS growth goes, so does the stock price, and this is why the entire market is now willing to pay up to 167.3x the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, a significant premium compared to the 109.3x average P/E for the materials sector today. Markets are often willing to overpay for names that they expect will outperform not only their peers but also the broader market. Commercial Metals stock's massive EPS growth and diversification between the United States and China justify a premium. As of mid-July 2025, Wall Street analysts seem to have figured out that Steel Dynamics stock is one of the clear winners in the steel industry. This might be why an analyst like Bill Peterson from J.P. Morgan Chase decided to boost his valuation target from $138 per share to a much higher $150 valuation. This new view implies that the stock could deliver up to 20% upside moves in the coming months and quarters, but like others, this one is also justified. Wall Street analysts also anticipate significant EPS growth in the coming quarters, with a target of $2.88 for the fourth quarter of 2025. Compared to today’s reported $2.01 in EPS, this suggests investors could be positioned for a 43% growth rate in earnings, which supports the double-digit upside potential seen in these valuation targets as well. This would make it another perfect candidate for starting a DCA strategy today for the coming quarters. Just as in the other names on this list, smart money has already started to apply this strategy, as those from Robeco Institutional Asset Management boosted their position in Steel Dynamics stock by 40.6% as of mid-July 2025 for a net holding of $214.5 million today, and another vote of confidence for this winner.

Could Baker Hughes Be an Unlikely Winner in Drone Defense Boom?,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/could-baker-hughes-be-an-unlikely-winner-in-drone-defense-boom/,"Baker Hughes NASDAQ: BKR won't be a name that comes to mind in the context of rising global defense budgets. However, the company’s recent earnings report shows why Baker Hughes may have an unrealized advantage as energy infrastructure, digital automation, and drone warfare become increasingly interconnected. Baker Hughes is best known as a provider of energy and oilfield services. That makes the company’s earnings and stock price sensitive to the price of oil and natural gas. A closer look at the company’s earnings report shows how it continues to transform itself into a technology-driven industrial player. Specifically, Baker Hughes is building adjacent capabilities in digital infrastructure, industrial AI, and process optimization. These are assets that could quietly align it with next-generation defense priorities. After the passage of the Trump administration’s “One Big, Beautiful Bill,” the U.S. defense budget for fiscal 2025 will exceed $900 billion. That dollar figure is impressive, but it’s where those dollars will be allocated that may be more significant to Baker Hughes. The U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) intends to make significant allocations toward unmanned systems (e.g., drones), energy resilience, and digital warfare. That has many investors looking to traditional defense contractors like Lockheed Martin Corp. NYSE: LMT and Northrop Grumman Corp. NYSE: NOC. However, to accomplish its objectives, the DOD will have to turn to industrial technology providers to source advanced capabilities in the energy space. This is where Baker Hughes may fit in. Like most energy stocks, Baker Hughes has had an “okay” year. BKR stock is up about 6.8% year-to-date. However, the stock jumped over 9.5% after its second quarter earnings report. A key factor was the company’s revenue of $6.8 billion, along with a 130-basis-point increase in operating margin. But what’s more revealing is where the growth is coming from. In short, Baker Hughes is not just about notoriously cyclical pumps and pipes. The company is pivoting into sensors, software, AI-driven diagnostics, and modular energy systems. It's important to emphasize that this isn’t happening today. However, there are reasons to believe Baker Hughes can fit into the Pentagon’s long-term plans. To understand this, it’s important to remember that drones are complex systems that require predictive maintenance, remote power systems, and AI-based monitoring and control systems. These are areas where Baker Hughes’ industrial tools could find crossover applications. For example: The company’s earnings presentation noted, “We continue to invest in technologies that support electrification and energy efficiency across industries.” Given that the U.S. Department of Defense increasingly awards contracts to tech-forward industrial partners, BKR could be on the shortlist for non-traditional support roles, especially in energy and logistics. From mid-June to mid-July, BKR stock formed an ascending triangle pattern. A breakout above resistance on strong earnings and volume confirms this bullish formation. With the sharp run-up after earnings, BKR stock has pushed well above its 50-day simple moving average. A bullish reversal in the MACD also supports the sharp move higher. However, with an RSI above 80 as of this writing, BKR may be due for a short-term pullback. Even without the potential catalyst from defense contracts, Baker Hughes looks like a good value at this level. To begin with, even after the sharp post-earnings move, Baker Hughes is trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 16.8x. That’s slightly above the stock’s historical average, but it’s reasonable relative to the sector average. Furthermore, the company approved a $3 billion share repurchase authorization and pays a dividend with a 2.4% yield. Before you consider Baker Hughes, you'll want to hear this."
MarketBeat Week in Review – 07/21 - 07/25,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/marketbeat-week-in-review-07-21-07-25/,"Stocks were up this week as the summer rally continues. There was mixed news from the tech sector this week, but on the whole, earnings have been better-than-expected. That trend will likely continue when many mega-cap technology stocks report next week. Continued capital expenditures in artificial intelligence are likely to be bullish for the sector. Another big story this week was the finalization of a trade deal between the United States and Japan. However, tariff uncertainty still lingers, particularly with the Trump administration’s August 1 deadline looming. There’s a lot to be sorted out that could move markets. Next week will be an important week for economic data. The Federal Reserve will issue its next decision on interest rates on Wednesday. The expectation is for no change in interest rates, but investors will look for any signal that a cut is coming in September. However, the bigger market mover may come from the July Jobs report on Friday. Articles by Thomas Hughes As important as AI is to investors today, Thomas Hughes wrote this week that Physical AI is the real endgame for this technology. However, that endgame is already taking shape, and Hughes gave investors five physical AI stocks that investors could buy today and hold for triple-digit returns. Turning his attention to value stocks, Hughes analyzed the earnings report from Verizon Communications, Inc. NYSE: VZ. The stock is known for its high-yield dividend, but Hughes explained why VZ stock is a solid growth opportunity after its bullish report. Congressional trading activity has become a topic of keen interest to investors. This week, Hughes highlighted the five stocks with the most Congressional selling in the year's first half and explained why you may or may not want to follow their lead. Articles by Sam Quirke Tesla Inc. NASDAQ: TSLA stock was down sharply after the company’s earnings report, in which chief executive officer (CEO) Elon Musk warned that the next two quarters could be challenging. Sam Quirke broke down the report and explained why analysts are playing the long game as traders move out of the stock. Qualcomm Inc. NASDAQ: QCOM is one of the more undervalued semiconductor stocks. Quirke noted that a recent price target hike and the company’s upcoming earnings report may mean the rally in QCOM stock is just getting started. On the other end of the value spectrum, Amazon.com Inc. NASDAQ: AMZN stock has rallied toward its February high. However, Quirke pointed out that the stock now comes with a relatively high valuation. That means investors may need a strong earnings report to push the stock higher. Articles by Chris Markoch Palantir Technologies Inc. NASDAQ: PLTR continues to outperform the broader market in 2025. However, Chris Markoch highlighted the sentiment shift between technical indicators and options activity. This could make PLTR stock more volatile than usual heading into its earnings report in early August. Many consumer discretionary stocks continue to underperform the market. However, that’s not the case for three streaming stocks. All three are moving lower after hitting an all-time high, but Markoch explained why each could reverse that trend with solid earnings. Markoch also introduced MarketBeat’s new FDA Events Tool and highlighted three small-cap biotech stocks with critical upcoming catalysts that could give investors a good reason to accumulate shares for future growth. Articles by Ryan Hasson All good things must come to an end. As Ryan Hasson wrote this week, that’s the general sentiment around the recent pullback in Rocket Lab USA Inc. NASDAQ: RKLB stock. The stock is down double digits from its parabolic move to an all-time high, but Hasson notes that technical and fundamental factors support the long-term bull case, which could make this a time to buy the dip. Alphabet Inc. NASDAQ: GOOGL stock has been lagging its Magnificent Seven counterparts this year. However, Hasson explained why that may change after the company crushed its earnings report and answered some key questions about the health of its search, cloud computing, and AI businesses. Investors may notice that risk-on sentiment is starting to run rampant. Hasson noted that impulse could be good for investors with room for speculative stocks in their portfolio. This week, Hasson analyzed five high-risk/high-reward stocks that are showing strong momentum. Articles by Gabriel Osorio-Mazilli The latest cryptocurrency rally started with Bitcoin surging to an all-time high. However, Gabriel Osorio-Mazilli explained to investors that the real opportunity may be in these three stocks that are bringing Bitcoin to the broader market. A sharp move higher in several stocks has some analysts believing meme stock mania is back. However, when it comes to the surge in Opendoor Technologies Inc. NASDAQ: OPEN, Osorio-Mazilli highlighted some key fundamental reasons that make the stock more than a retail play. Enthusiasm over the buildout of an AI infrastructure is reaching a fever pitch. Osorio-Mazilli explained why that is bullish for Super Micro Computer Inc. NASDAQ: SMCI. Institutional investors have moved beyond the accounting irregularities from earlier this year and are now leading the stock higher. Articles by Leo Miller A key theme in the tech sector is how one company’s growth plans positively impact another company’s stock. Leo Miller gave investors an example of that this week. Miller explained why Meta Platform Inc. NASDAQ: META's plans to invest in “titan cluster” data centers are a game-changer for Broadcom Inc. NASDAQ: AVGO stock. The quantum computing space continues to evolve quickly. This week, Miller highlighted the recent surge in Rigetti Computing Inc. NASDAQ: RGTI stock, being fueled by the company’s decision to take a step back to make a strong move forward. When companies raise their guidance, analysts typically begin raising their price targets. That combination is always bullish for a stock in the long term. This week, Miller pointed investors to four stocks receiving higher price targets fresh off of raised guidance in their earnings reports. Articles by Nathan Reiff This week, Nathan Reiff analyzed the recent surge in shares of D-Wave Quantum Inc. NYSE: QBTS. The stock appeared to be moving higher in concert with other quantum computing stocks. However, with no specific catalyst for the spike, Reiff reminded investors that, while QBTS stock looks promising, caution should be the watchword as profitability remains elusive. Companies are sometimes punished when an earnings report is only “good enough.” Reiff explained why that appears to be the case with three stocks that are down despite solid, but not spectacular, reports. This can be where long-term investors should pay attention to analysts upgrading these stocks, which could signal a buy-the-dip opportunity. Despite the continued interest in high-growth technology stocks, Reiff pointed out that investors looking for passive income and growth through dividend stocks haven’t been disappointed. That’s particularly true if they own one of the three high-yield dividend payers that carry some risk, but offer the chance of a market-beating reward. Articles by Dan Schmidt “Is China investable again?” Dan Schmidt attempted to answer this week. Schmidt noted that with trade tensions easing, three large-cap Chinese stocks are starting to look good for value investors. Robinhood Markets Inc. NASDAQ: HOOD has been one of the best-performing stocks in 2025. This week, Schmidt pointed out a small line item in the One Big, Beautiful Bill that will make the stock more attractive to professional sports bettors looking to reduce their tax burden. Articles by Jeffrey Neal Johnson Many MarketBeat analysts wrote about specific quantum computing stocks this week. Jeffrey Neal Johnson compiled much of that information to explain what catalysts are pushing three quantum computing stocks higher this summer. Johnson also wrote about the recent price spike in AST Spacemobile Inc. NASDAQ: ASTS after a recent contract announcement. Analysts haven’t jumped on board yet, but Johnson reminded investors that this could be one time when being early is just fine. The U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) has $900 billion to put to use. However, as Johnson wrote this week, it won’t be business as usual, which is good news for investors in Kratos Defense & Security Solutions Inc. NASDAQ: KTOS. Articles by Jordan Chussler Investing in AI and data centers doesn’t have to be exclusive to growth investors. This week, Jordan Chussler highlighted Iron Mountain Inc. NYSE: IRM, which operates as a real estate investment trust (REIT) in the data center space. Chussler explained why the company’s fundamentals suggest the stock could be an undervalued gem for buy-and-hold value investors. Speaking of value investors, many such investors walked away from AT&T Inc. NYSE: T after it cut its dividend in 2022. However, Chussler explained why recent legislation is likely to be bullish for the company’s fundamentals, and institutional buyers are starting to take notice."
US-China trade talks: Can China reduce its export dependence?,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/us-china-trade-talks-can-china-reduce-its-export-dependence-2025-07-26/,"BEIJING (AP) — China’s high dependence on exports will likely be a key focus of a new round of U.S.-China trade talks this coming week in Stockholm, but a trade deal would not necessarily help Beijing to rebalance its economy. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said he hopes the negotiations can take up this issue, along with China's purchases of oil from Russia and Iran, which undercut American sanctions on those two countries. Hopes rose for a breakthrough in talks after U.S. President Donald Trump announced deals with Japan, Indonesia and the Philippines this week. The U.S. wants China to do two things: Reduce what both the U.S. and the European Union see as excess production capacity in many industries, including steel and electric vehicles. And secondly, to take steps to increase spending by Chinese consumers so the economy relies more on domestic demand and less on exports. “We could also discuss the elephant in the room, which is this great rebalancing that the Chinese need to do,” Bessent told financial news network CNBC. He said China's share of global manufacturing exports at nearly 30%, “can’t get any bigger, and it should probably shrink.” The issues are not new, and China has been working to address them for years, more for domestic reasons than to reduce its trade surpluses with the U.S. and other countries. Bessent's predecessor as treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, made industrial policy a focus of a trip to China last year. She blamed government subsidies for flooding the global market with “artificially cheap Chinese products.” The European Union, whose top leaders met their Chinese counterparts in Beijing on Thursday, has cited subsidies to justify EU tariffs on electric vehicles made in China. In the 1980s, the U.S. pressured Japan to boost consumer spending when American manufacturing was overwhelmed by exports from the likes of Toyota and Sony. Economists have long argued that China likewise needs to transform into a more consumer-driven economy. Consumer spending accounts for less than 40% of China’s economy, versus close to 70% in the United States and about 54% in Japan. Chinese leaders have spoken about both factory overcapacity and weak consumer spending as long-term problems and have sought over the past 20 years to find ways to rebalance the economy away from export manufacturing and massive investments in dams, roads, railways and other infrastructure. Fierce price wars have prompted critical reports in official media saying that companies are “racing to the bottom,” skimping on quality and even safety to reduce costs. With strong government support, they've also expanded overseas, where they can charge higher prices but still undercut local competitors, creating a political backlash. All that competition and price cutting has left China battling deflation, or falling prices. When companies receive less for their products, they tend to invest less. That can lead to job cuts and lower wages, sapping business activity and spending power — contrary to the long-term goal of increasing the share of consumer spending in driving overall growth. To counter that, the government is spending billions on rebates and subsidies for people who trade in their cars or appliances for new ones. But acknowledging a problem and solving it are two different things. Economists say more fundamental changes are needed to boost consumption and rein in overcapacity. Such changes can only come incrementally over time. Private Chinese companies and foreign-invested companies create the most jobs, but they've suffered from swings in policy and pressures from the trade war, especially since the pandemic. Demographic changes are another challenge as China's population shrinks and ages. Many experts advocate expanding China's social safety net, health insurance, pensions and other support systems, so that people would feel freer to spend rather than save for a medical emergency or retirement. Yan Se, an economist at Peking University's Guanghua School of Management, warned at a recent forum that deflation will become a long-term issue if China doesn't step up its welfare benefits. “Chinese people deserve a better life,"" he said. One possibility, put forward at the same forum by Liu Qiao, the dean of the business school, would be to change incentives for local government officials, rewarding them for raising consumption or household incomes instead of meeting an economic growth target. He doesn't see that happening nationwide but said it could be tested in a province. “That would send out a message that China needs a different approach,” he said. Chinese leader Xi Jinping has made transforming the country into a technology superpower a top priority. It's a goal that has gained urgency as the U.S. has tightened restrictions on China's access to high-end semiconductors and other advanced knowhow. Output in high-tech manufacturing is growing quickly, adding to potential overcapacity, just as what happened with the government's encouragement of “green” technologies such as solar panels and wind turbines. Various industries, including EV makers, have pledged to address the issue, but some local governments are striving to keep money-losing enterprises afloat, reluctant to lose tax revenues and jobs, or to fail to meet economic growth targets. Going forward, the government is calling for more coordination of economic development polices in fields such as artificial intelligence so that not every province champions the same industry. But government moves to counter the impact of higher tariffs tend to support sectors already in overcapacity, and the share of consumption in the economy has fallen in recent years. “A sustained improvement in household consumption will require greater reform ambition,” the World Bank said in its most recent update on China's economy."" ___ AP Business Writer Elaine Kurtenbach in Bangkok contributed to this report."
Policy officially takes over for Murphy as president/CEO at Packers' shareholders meeting,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/policy-officially-takes-over-for-murphy-as-presidentceo-at-packers-shareholders-meeting-2025-07-25/,"GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) — Ed Policy began his tenure as the Green Bay Packers’ president/CEO by paying tribute to his predecessor. Policy officially took over for Mark Murphy on Friday as the NFL’s only publicly owned franchise held its annual shareholders meeting. During Murphy’s 17 seasons on the job, the Packers made 13 playoff appearances, with the 2010 team winning a Super Bowl. “I assure you that going forward I’m going to lean heavily on your example and your pearls of wisdom as I move the organization into the future,” Policy said. Murphy is stepping down because he reached the franchise’s mandatory retirement age of 70 earlier this month. Murphy said he felt he could continue meeting the demands of this position but added that he agrees with the Packers’ retirement policy. “In my career – business and with the league and others – you see examples where maybe people stay on a little too long, so I think this serves the Packers well,” Murphy said. Policy, 54, didn’t focus much on his own plans during the shareholders meeting, which instead pretty much served as a testimonial for Murphy. There were plenty of shouts of “Thank you, Mark,” among the 6,529 shareholders in the Lambeau Field stands. On a hot afternoon, many shareholders tried to cool themselves off by waving fans that featured Murphy’s face. A tribute video included messages from NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and former commissioner Paul Tagliabue among others. Murphy signed autographs and greeted fans after the Packers’ Friday morning practice and again after the shareholders meeting. “It’s a little bittersweet,” Murphy said. “Obviously, I’m a very appreciative and I also feel honored, too, that the fans have been so supportive of me and the organization. But (I’m) really excited too for the future of the organization and for Ed in particular.” The Packers say Murphy, who played defensive back for Washington from 1977-84, is believed to be the only person to earn a Super Bowl ring both as a player and as a team’s chief executive. He was on Washington’s 1982 championship team. His stint as Green Bay’s president/CEO included the construction of Titletown, a 45-acre development adjacent to Lambeau Field that features shops, restaurants and apartments. He capped his tenure earlier this year by welcoming the NFL Draft to Green Bay, an event that drew an announced three-day total attendance of 600,000. Murphy also presided over multiple renovations to Lambeau Field, including the opening of a new home locker room this week. “He’s been tremendous for us,” wide receiver Jayden Reed said. “I thanked him today, knowing this was his last day here, so I went up to him and I thanked him for everything. Without him, we wouldn’t be standing in this locker room right now. He’s been a tremendous help to all of us, very supportive. He gets this thing done. I appreciate him for that.” Murphy said he hopes to stay involved in the game and noted that he’s talked to Goodell about things he’d like to do on a league level. He also mentioned spending more time with his family and increasing his involvement in his charity work and in the golf course he owns at Baileys Harbor, Wisconsin. The Packers’ board of directors unanimously selected Policy as Murphy’s replacement after a search committee recommended him last year. Policy, the son of former San Francisco 49ers and Cleveland Browns president, joined the Packers as vice president and general counsel in August 2012 and was promoted to chief operating officer in January 2018. “I want to thank you, our owners, for investing so much in me over the past 13 years,” Policy told the shareholders. “It’s been really special, and I intend to pay it back with results both on and off the field.” Packers coach Matt LaFleur, general manager Brian Gutekunst and executive vice president/director of player operations Russ Ball report to the president/CEO under the team’s leadership structure. All three of them have two years remaining on their contracts. Policy said earlier this year he has no plans to extend those contracts before this season, though he praised all three men and noted his long working relationships with them. “(I’m) certainly going to miss Mark and everything that he’s done for this place, but feel like we’re in great hands with a guy like Ed Policy,” LaFleur said. Murphy was asked what advice he had for Policy. “The one thing I told him is he’s got to be himself,” Murphy said. “I’ve seen him grow quite a bit as a leader. The search ended up with him. They did a great job. There’s no question he’s positioned and ready to have success. “He and I have talked about it. Don’t be afraid to change things. Follow your instincts. He’s got really good business sense. Hopefully we put him in a position where he can have success not only in the short term but the long term of the organization.” NOTES: LaFleur said OL Aaron Banks is “day to day” with a back issue. … Rookie WR Savion Williams didn’t practice Friday due to a concussion. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL"
Citi launches Strata Elite Card to compete with AmEx and Chase,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/citi-launches-strata-elite-card-to-compete-with-amex-and-chase-2025-07-27/,"NEW YORK (AP) — There’s a new but familiar face coming to the world of high-end credit cards. Citigroup is launching the Strata Elite Card, the bank’s latest attempt to grab a piece of the high-fee, high-rewards credit card market that’s dominated by American Express’ Platinum Card and JPMorgan Chase’s Sapphire Reserve Card. The card, which is priced less than the Platinum Card and the Sapphire Reserve Card at an annual fee of $595, will offer points multiples for certain types of spending, like hotels, car rents, air travel and restaurants. Additionally, the card will offer points for everyday spending, as well as a $300 hotel credit and a $200 “splurge” credit at brands like Best Buy, Live Nation and others. Citi has had other forays into the high-end credit card market. The company launched Citi Prestige in 2013 as a direct competitor to the American Express Platinum Card, and the card won high praise from travel fanatics when it debuted for its hefty rewards program and perks. But Prestige lost its prestige when Chase launched the Sapphire Reserve Card, a credit card that was an instant hit when it was released in 2016, and when AmEx overhauled the Platinum Card to be more competitive. Citi stopped allowing new applications for Prestige in 2021, but the card’s benefits still exist for customers carrying the card. Strata Elite is facing a highly competitive marketplace. Along with the Platinum Card and Sapphire Reserve, there are other rewards-heavy cards like Capital One’s Venture X Card and a coming high rewards card from credit card upstart Bilt early next year. Chase raised the annual fee on Sapphire Reserve to $795 as part of a product refresh in June, and American Express has indicated it will be revising the Platinum Card’s rewards and perks later this year. A customer who ends up carrying two of these high-fee cards can quickly spend more than $1,000 on annual fees. So far, credit card companies have been able to justify these fees by attaching lucrative perks to the cards, like travel or other spending credits, and generous rewards programs, effectively marketing them as a high-end subscription plan. But it’s not clear how willing customers are to carry several of these cards each year. This is the third in the Citi Strata card family, following a similar formula to other banks where there’s a “good, better, best” choice for customers. The other cards are the Citi Strata Card and Strata Premier. The biggest earning potential on Citi’s new card is by booking travel through Citi’s new travel portal, which gives 12 times points on Citi’s “Thank You” rewards program. Credit card companies are trying to push customers onto their own travel portals, where banks can contract directly with airlines and hotels and make sure customers use their branded credit cards when traveling. American Express, Chase and Capital One have all built out their travel services in recent years and are increasingly offering customers better rewards and redemptions for using their services instead of booking through a place like Expedia. Before you consider JPMorgan Chase & Co., you'll want to hear this."
Paramount gets green light for $8 billion merger. But what is the psychic cost for company?,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/paramount-gets-green-light-for-8-billion-merger-but-what-is-the-psychic-cost-for-company-2025-07-25/,"With this week’s FCC approval, the merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media is expected to be completed in the coming weeks at a value of $8 billion. The question for the new company is whether the psychic cost is much higher. It has been a particularly rough few months at Paramount-owned CBS, where the settlement of a lawsuit regarding “60 Minutes” and announced end of Stephen Colbert's late-night show has led critics to suggest corporate leaders were bowing to President Donald Trump. Following the Federal Communications Commission approval Thursday, one of the triumvirate of current Paramount leaders, Chris McCarthy, said that he would be leaving the company. McCarthy has been in charge of fading cable properties like MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon, expected to bear the brunt of an estimated $2 billion in cost cuts identified by Skydance leaders. Skydance head David Ellison is expected to head the new company, and he has identified former NBC Universal executive Jeff Shell as the incoming president. After the merger's Aug. 7 closing date, the new leaders will be watched most closely for how they deal with CBS News, particularly given the $16 million paid in a settlement of Trump's complaint that last fall's “60 Minutes” interview was edited to make opponent Kamala Harris look good. Two news executives — News CEO Wendy McMahon and “60 Minutes” executive producer Bill Owens — resigned due to their opposition to the deal. The appointment of respected insider Tanya Simon to replace Owens this week was seen as a positive sign by people at “60 Minutes.” Days before the FCC's vote, Paramount agreed to hire an ombudsman at CBS News with the mission of investigating complaints of political bias. “In all respects, Skydance will ensure that CBS's reporting is fair, unbiased, and fact-based,” Skydance said in a letter to FCC Chairman Brendan Carr. The role of an ombudsman, or public editor, who examines a news outlet's work is often positive — if they are given independence, said Kelly McBride, an ethics expert who has had that role at NPR for five years. “You really want the person to have loyalty only to their own judgment and the journalistic mission of the organization,” she said. Having the sole mission of examining bias could be problematic, however. To be fair, a journalist's work should be closely studied before making that determination, not judged on the basis of one report or passage, she said. Carr, in an interview with CNBC on Friday, said the role “should go a long way toward restoring America's trust in media.” Anna Gomez, an FCC commissioner who voted to reject the deal on Thursday, interpreted the arrangement as a way for the government to control journalists. “They want the news media to report on them in a positive light or in the light that they want,” Gomez told MSNBC. “So they don't want the media to do their job, which is to hold government to account without fear or favor.” According to published reports, Ellison has explored purchasing The Free Press, a flourishing news site founded by Bari Weiss perhaps best known for a former NPR editor's study of liberal bias in public broadcasting. An Ellison spokeswoman did not return a message seeking comment on Friday. Colbert's slow-motion firing — he'll work until the end of his contract next May — was described by CBS as a financial decision given late-night television's collapsing economics. Colbert's relentless lampooning of Trump, and his criticism of the “60 Minutes” settlement, led to suspicion of those motives. “Was this really financial?” comic Jon Stewart wondered. ""Or maybe the path of least resistance for your $8 billion merger was killing a show that you know rankled a fragile and vengeful president?” Stewart's profane criticism on his own Paramount-owned show may provide its own test for Skydance. “The Daily Show” is one of the few original programs left on Comedy Central, and his contract ends later this year. In an odd way, Comedy Central's “South Park” buttresses CBS' claim that the Colbert decision was financial, not political. Creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone delivered an episode this week that depicted a naked Trump in bed with the devil. Paramount just signed Parker and Stone to a new $1.5 billion deal that Skydance executives surely cleared; it makes the entire “South Park” library available for streaming on Paramount+. a platform where Colbert's show doesn't do nearly as well. Figuring out what to do with others at Paramount's cable networks, or even the networks as a whole, will be an early decision for Ellison, son of multibillionaire and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison. “There is a clear opportunity to improve Paramount's growth profile by letting those assets go,” analyst Doug Creutz of TD Securities told investors Friday. “On the other hand, we suspect the Ellisons did not purchase Paramount in order to break it up for parts.” The merger also brings together the Paramount movie studio with one of its most regular partners. David Ellison has been one of the industry's top investors and producers since founding Skydance in 2006. Ellison has a challenge here, too: Years of uncertainty over its future and modest investment in its movie pipeline has shrunk Paramount's market share to last among the major studios. The Paramount+ streaming service has been a money-loser. To revive Paramount, Ellison will look to revamp its streaming operations, leverage its franchises and try to bolster family content. ___ AP Film Writer Jake Coyle contributed to this report.

"Tea, an app for women to safely talk about men they date, has been breached, user IDs exposed",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/tea-an-app-for-women-to-safely-talk-about-men-they-date-has-been-breached-user-ids-exposed-2025-07-25/,"Tea, an app designed to let women safely discuss men they date has been breached, with thousands of selfies and photo IDs of users exposed, the company confirmed on Friday. Tea said that about 72,000 images were leaked online, including 13,000 images of selfies or selfies featuring a photo identification that users submitted during account verification. Another 59,000 images publicly viewable in the app from posts, comments and direct messages were also accessed without authorization, according to a Tea spokesperson. No email addresses or phone numbers were accessed, the company said, and the breach only affects users who signed up before February 2024. “Tea has engaged third-party cybersecurity experts and are working around the clock to secure its systems,” the company said. “At this time, there is no evidence to suggest that additional user data was affected. Protecting tea users’ privacy and data is their highest priority.” Tea presents itself as a safe way for women to anonymously vet men they might connect with on dating apps such as Tinder or Bumble — ensuring that your date is “safe, not a catfish, and not in a relationship.” “Tea is a must-have app, helping women avoid red flags before the first date with dating advice, and showing them who’s really behind the profile of the person they’re dating,” reads Tea's app store description. 404 Media, which earlier reported the breach, said it was 4Chan users who discovered an exposed database that “allowed anyone to access the material"" from Tea. “While reporting this story, a URL the 4chan user posted included a voluminous list of specific attachments associated with the Tea app. 404 Media saw this list of files. In the last hour or so, that page was locked down, and now returns a “Permission denied” error,” 404 Media reported Friday. Tea said in an Instagram post this week that it has reached 4 million users."
