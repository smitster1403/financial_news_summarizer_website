"As electric bills rise, evidence mounts that data centers share blame. States feel pressure to act",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/as-electric-bills-rise-evidence-mounts-that-data-centers-share-blame-states-feel-pressure-to-act-2025-08-08/,"HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Amid rising electric bills, states are under pressure to insulate regular household and business ratepayers from the costs of feeding Big Tech's energy-hungry data centers. It's not clear that any state has a solution and the actual effect of data centers on electricity bills is difficult to pin down. Some critics question whether states have the spine to take a hard line against tech behemoths like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta. But more than a dozen states have begun taking steps as data centers drive a rapid build-out of power plants and transmission lines. That has meant pressuring the nation's biggest power grid operator to clamp down on price increases, studying the effect of data centers on electricity bills or pushing data center owners to pay a larger share of local transmission costs. Rising power bills are “something legislators have been hearing a lot about. It’s something we’ve been hearing a lot about. More people are speaking out at the public utility commission in the past year than I’ve ever seen before,” said Charlotte Shuff of the Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board, a consumer advocacy group. “There’s a massive outcry.” Some data centers could require more electricity than cities the size of Pittsburgh, Cleveland or New Orleans, and make huge factories look tiny by comparison. That's pushing policymakers to rethink a system that, historically, has spread transmission costs among classes of consumers that are proportional to electricity use. “A lot of this infrastructure, billions of dollars of it, is being built just for a few customers and a few facilities and these happen to be the wealthiest companies in the world,” said Ari Peskoe, who directs the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard University. “I think some of the fundamental assumptions behind all this just kind of breaks down.” A fix, Peskoe said, is a “can of worms"" that pits ratepayer classes against one another. Some officials downplay the role of data centers in pushing up electric bills. Tricia Pridemore, who sits on Georgia’s Public Service Commission and is president of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, pointed to an already tightened electricity supply and increasing costs for power lines, utility poles, transformers and generators as utilities replace aging equipment or harden it against extreme weather. The data centers needed to accommodate the artificial intelligence boom are still in the regulatory planning stages, Pridemore said, and the Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech firms and data center developers, has said its members are committed to paying their fair share. But growing evidence suggests that the electricity bills of some Americans are rising to subsidize the massive energy needs of Big Tech as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority. Data and analytics firm Wood Mackenzie published a report in recent weeks that suggested 20 proposed or effective specialized rates for data centers in 16 states it studied aren’t nearly enough to cover the cost of a new natural gas power plant. In other words, unless utilities negotiate higher specialized rates, other ratepayer classes — residential, commercial and industrial — are likely paying for data center power needs. Meanwhile, Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog for the mid-Atlantic grid, produced research in June showing that 70% — or $9.3 billion — of last year's increased electricity cost was the result of data center demand. Last year, five governors led by Pennsylvania's Josh Shapiro began pushing back against power prices set by the mid-Atlantic grid operator, PJM Interconnection, after that amount spiked nearly sevenfold. They warned of customers “paying billions more than is necessary.” PJM has yet to propose ways to guarantee that data centers pay their freight, but Monitoring Analytics is floating the idea that data centers should be required to procure their own power. In a filing last month, it said that would avoid a ""massive wealth transfer” from average people to tech companies. At least a dozen states are eyeing ways to make data centers pay higher local transmission costs. In Oregon, a data center hot spot, lawmakers passed legislation in June ordering state utility regulators to develop new — presumably higher — power rates for data centers. The Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board says there is clear evidence that costs to serve data centers are being spread across all customers — at a time when some electric bills there are up 50% over the past four years and utilities are disconnecting more people than ever. New Jersey’s governor signed legislation last month commissioning state utility regulators to study whether ratepayers are being hit with “unreasonable rate increases” to connect data centers and to develop a specialized rate to charge data centers. In some other states, like Texas and Utah, governors and lawmakers are trying to avoid a supply-and-demand crisis that leaves ratepayers on the hook — or in the dark. In Indiana, state utility regulators approved a settlement between Indiana Michigan Power Co., Amazon, Google, Microsoft and consumer advocates that set parameters for data center payments for service. Kerwin Olsen, of the Citizens Action Council of Indiana, a consumer advocacy group, signed the settlement and called it a “pretty good deal” that contained more consumer protections than what state lawmakers passed. But, he said, state law doesn't force large power users like data centers to publicly reveal their electric usage, so pinning down whether they're paying their fair share of transmission costs ""will be a challenge.” In a March report, the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard University questioned the motivation of utilities and regulators to shield ratepayers from footing the cost of electricity for data centers. Both utilities and states have incentives to attract big customers like data centers, it said. To do it, utilities — which must get their rates approved by regulators — can offer “special deals to favored customers” like a data center and effectively shift the costs of those discounts to regular ratepayers, the authors wrote. Many state laws can shield disclosure of those rates, they said. In Pennsylvania, an emerging data center hot spot, the state utility commission is drafting a model rate structure for utilities to consider adopting. An overarching goal is to get data center developers to put their money where their mouth is. “We’re talking about real transmission upgrades, potentially hundreds of millions of dollars,” commission chairman Stephen DeFrank said. “And that’s what you don’t want the ratepayer to get stuck paying for."" ___ Follow Marc Levy on X at https://x.com/timelywriter.

Retiring and relocating? Take a holistic approach,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/retiring-and-relocating-take-a-holistic-approach-2025-08-08/,"NEW YORK (AP) — Debra Taylor has had a busy year or so: She's going through a divorce while in the process of retiring — and she's moving to Portugal from Southern California with one of her daughters. After deciding her next home would be outside the U.S., she narrowed down her choices based on tax burdens (Spain was out with its wealth taxes), climate (no Costa Rica, too hot) and ease of travel within Europe, one of her favorite parts of the world. She then toured Portugal with a relocation company, Expatsi, and found her new home, Aveiro. It's a striking city on the country's west coast with lovely canals that earned it the nickname the Venice of Portugal. It's all logistics from there. Taylor signed a year lease on an apartment (a requirement for moving forward), hired the company Viv Europe to navigate bureaucracies and paperwork, signed up for the necessary FBI background check and has an appointment in late September to move ahead with visas. Her youngest child gave her the idea to leave the country. “After our current president was elected, my 18-year-old transgender daughter came to me and said, ‘I want to get out of this country ASAP,’” Taylor recalled. “That was just fine with me.” Her oldest daughter, who's 20, will stay in the U.S. to complete college. “None of this means I have to live there forever,” Taylor said. “I’ll use this as my jumping-off point to do more deeper dives, explore the rest of the region. I want to buy a place, but I’m not going to do that until I’m living there and spend more time in different communities.” According to aging and relocation experts, Taylor has made the right decisions. The number of people who relocate upon retirement fluctuates, based on such factors as politics, home affordability and cost-of-living rates. While older adults are less likely to move than younger populations, more than 3 million people age 65 and older relocated within the U.S. in the five years before the coronavirus pandemic, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. As for moving abroad, U.S. politics is now the No. 1 reason cited by people who use Expatsi, the company's co-founder Jen Barnett said. “The one downside is that a lot of countries retirees are interested in don’t want retirees, and that is to say wealthy, English-speaking countries, because they want laborers,” Barnett said. While most U.S. retirees stay put in existing homes and locales, those who want to age in place face mounting challenges, said AARP Vice President Rodney Harrell, who focuses on housing and livable communities. Challenges include rising rents or mortgages, costs for home modifications, and a lack of community support services like adequate health care, reliable utilities and safe environments. “One of the biggest challenges that we have is making sure that we take the future us into account, and not just look at our needs today,"" Harrell said. “Are we driving today? Is our income where it is? Is our spouse and myself healthy right now? How able are we to walk around and use steps, etc.? Things can change.” All of the above is crucial as the U.S. heads into a gray bubble. “We’re going to have more people over 65 than under 18 by 2034. For the first time in U.S. history, we have more older adults than children,” Harrell said. Do you want mountains, an ocean, to be closer to grandkids? Would you like a university town or city, a particular religious institution? Harrell suggests setting clear priorities when planning a relocation. And they should go well beyond those specifications. Taking housing costs into consideration is generally universal, he said, but he urged a more subtle consideration. “What are the neighbors like? Is it an active community, if that’s what you want. Do people keep to themselves more? That social connection is really important, too,” Harrell said. The AARP's livability index scores neighborhoods and communities across the U.S. for the services and amenities that impact older people. It's easily searchable by address, city, state or ZIP code. “Think about all of the things that you might want collectively, and know that there’s no perfect place,” Harrell said. “Once you have those things in mind, you’ll get to the best possible outcome. Every place has trade-offs."" If being close to children and grandchildren is high on the list, set clear expectations about how involved you want to be in such things as child care, said retirement transition planner Elizabeth Zelinka Parsons. Also, chat with adult children before making a move to determine how settled they are themselves. Casey Bowers and her husband, Dave Bowers, recently relocated to Ericeira, northwest of Lisbon on Portugal's beachy Silver Coast. They love it, but it's not all ocean and sun. “We have three adult children and their partners, and one grandbaby with another on the way,” Casey said. “We're very close to our children. Learning the grocery store, getting new cellphones, those are just procedural things, but being away from family — that’s the hardest part.” Sarah Friedell O’Connell, a retirement coach in Boston, looks at relocation this way: “You’re going to get a lot of hours back when you stop your full-time job. What are you going to do with that time?"" As a wealth manager, Chad Harmer has helped dozens of retirees relocate, from Ontario, Canada, to Arizona’s High Desert, from the Boston suburbs to the Carolinas. And he's dealt with some “boomerang” moves back home after grandchildren arrived. “Start with a 'lifestyle audit,' not a tax table,"" he said. “I ask clients to write a perfect Thursday five years from now. Where are they walking? Who are they meeting for coffee? How long is the drive to the grandkids? That exercise surfaces climate preferences, social networks, volunteer hobbies and healthcare priorities long before we argue over property tax millage rates.” He also recommended budgeting for hidden inflators — such as higher insurance premiums in disaster-prone areas and frequent flights to see family — and considering less obvious weather complications, like pollen levels. Parsons, who wrote “Encore: A High Achiever's Guide to Thriving in Retirement,” is a staunch supporter of taking a short-term rental before deciding on a permanent move. “It's tempting to retire where you vacation, but that may not be the greatest idea,” she said. Harmer's rule of thumb: When 80 % of your desired daily routine is achievable in a new location for at least 80 % of the year, you’re in the right ZIP code. “Anything less and you’re probably chasing an Instagram fantasy rather than a retirement reality,” he said."
Why Trump's tariffs could be a disaster for Brazil's acai industry and American consumers,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/why-trumps-tariffs-could-be-a-disaster-for-brazils-acai-industry-and-american-consumers-2025-08-08/,"BELEM, Brazil (AP) — When U.S. President Donald Trump imposed tariffs of 50% on Brazilian exports in July, acai producer Ailson Ferreira Moreira felt immediately concerned. After all, who was going to eat all of that Amazon berry, globally famous as a delicious, refreshing and nutritious superfood, if American consumers suddenly could no longer afford it? As the main importer of the Brazilian berry, prices of acai smoothies and bowls look certain to go up in the United States. “The acai that’s all produced here ... If only people here eat it, it’s going to be a lot of acai, right?” Moreira told The Associated Press outside of Belem, an Amazon city of 1.4 million residents that will host this year's U.N. climate summit COP30 climate summi t in November. “If there’s too much acai here, people won’t be able to eat it all and the price will drop.” A single full crate of acai sells for around $50 at local markets in Brazil, a price that is now expected to plummet. The U.S. is by far the largest acai importer of a total Brazilian output currently estimated at about 70,000 tons per year. The most vulnerable acai producers in the northern state of Para say they have already been hit by tariffs imposed by the U.S. government, as a surplus of the berry without a clear destination starts to mount only days after the new economic scenario unfolded. More powerful exporters, such as Sao Paulo-state based company Acai Tropicalia Mix, are also feeling the impact. One of its owners, Rogério de Carvalho, told the AP that last year he exported to the U.S. about 270 tons of acai cream — an industrialized version of the berry — ready for consumption. As tariffs started to loom, he said, American importers steered away and clients suspended negotiations. Until the end of July, de Carvalho estimates that his company sold 27 tons to the U.S. “That's 1.5 million Brazilian reais ($280,000) that we lost,” the businessman said. “We are confident there will be a deal between the two countries to allow not only our clients to return, but also getting some new ones.” Trump has linked the higher tariffs on Brazil to the trial of former President Jair Bolsonaro, who is now under house arrest for his alleged role in leading an alleged coup plot to remain in office, despite his election loss to current leftist President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. And despite several Brazilian exports being exempted from the tariffs, acai berries aren't among them. Brazil's industry ministry didn't reply to a request for comment on whether acai berries are among the items that remain on the negotiating table with U.S. trade representatives. Nearly all of the acai consumed in the U.S. originates from Brazil, with the state of Para alone accounting for 90% of the country’s total production. Several communities in the Amazon depend on its harvest. The harvesting of acai is a physically demanding job that requires workers to climb tall trees with minimal safety equipment, and then sliding down branches full of berries to fill baskets and then place them carefully in crates. Analysts say its producers also help protect the rainforest from illegal loggers, miners and cattle ranchers. The night markets of Belem, such as the Ver-o-Peso acai market, are a hub of activity where the freshly harvested berries are brought in by boat and prepared for sale. The Brazilian Association of Fruit and Derivative Producers and Exporters estimates there was an explosive growth of acai exports from Para state, from less than one ton in 1999 to more than 61,000 tons in 2023. Another explosive rise was expected for this year, before the tariffs. On Thursday, Brazil requested consultations at the World Trade Organization over tariffs imposed by the Trump administration against the South American nation that went into effect on Wednesday. That could be took little too late for acai harvester Mikael Silva Trindade, who agrees that the future of the trade is at risk as higher U.S. tariffs can disrupt the delicate balance of supply and demand that holds the industry. “There will be nowhere to market (the excess of acai),” Trindade told the AP as he picked berries in Para state. “The more you export, the more valuable it becomes. But if there’s too much to sell, it will stay here and become cheap.” ___ Mauricio Savarese reported from Sao Paulo. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america Before you consider Amazon.com, you'll want to hear this."

"Airbnb Beats Earnings, But the Growth Story Is Losing Altitude",https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/airbnb-beats-earnings-but-the-growth-story-is-losing-altitude/,"Airbnb Inc. NASDAQ: ABNB stock is down 9.1% the day after the company’s second-quarter earnings report. The company beat on the top and bottom lines with earnings per share (EPS) of $1.03 and revenue of $3.10 billion. Those numbers were year-over-year (YOY) gains of 19% and 12% respectively. But headline numbers show where a company has been, not where it’s going. In the case of Airbnb, the company delivered tepid guidance for the coming quarter. Management’s Q3 revenue guidance of $4.02 to $4.1 billion represents about 8% year-over-year growth, a deceleration from the 12% the company just reported in Q2. It also seems to confirm that the economy may not be as strong as expected and suggests that investors may not want to buy this dip. The July Jobs report released on Aug. 1 challenged the assumption that the U.S. consumer was holding up well. But the performance of consumer discretionary stocks in 2025 has made some investors skeptical of that outlook. A research report from Bank of America (BofA) hints that this may be a time for investors to trust their intuition. In its July Consumer Checkpoint, BofA presented data showing consumer spending on services (including hotels, airfares, and dining) has declined for three straight months. One part of the report noted, “Discretionary services spending, particularly in travel, appears to be contributing negatively to services growth.” Airbnb's chief executive officer (CEO), Brian Chesky, was quick to tell analysts that the company was not satisfied with slow growth, saying, “We want the company to accelerate.” However, it’s fair to say that the call didn’t point to specific initiatives that would make this happen. For example, in discussing the company’s artificial intelligence (AI) investments, Chesky remarked that Airbnb continues “to explore how we can use AI to improve the guest and host experience, but we’re still early in identifying the most impactful use cases.” In discussing the potential opportunity in business travel, the CEO told analysts the company was “looking at ways to make Airbnb more compelling.” There were other examples, but a common theme on the earnings call was one that was non-committal without a product roadmap or a specific strategy outlined. It’s also a reminder that the reason to stay at an Airbnb property is not the same as the decision to buy ABNB stock. Many consumers swear by the home rental model and will never return to a hotel. The model works for many individuals, groups, and families, particularly those for whom the “where” is a key part of their vacation plans. But does that mean ABNB stock is a good investment? Right now, slowing growth shows a mature company finding it tough to innovate. For example, the company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $6 billion, which is generally positive for shareholders. However, at 30x forward earnings, ABNB is valued as a growth stock forecasting high single-digit growth, which makes it appear the company’s best days are behind it. The post-earnings sell-off has given investors the potential for more upside in ABNB stock. The consensus price target of $143.07 provides about 20% upside. However, several analysts have lowered their price targets since earnings. Investors looking to buy the dip may look at a $115 price target, but stronger support is more likely to be around $110 or even $100. But before taking action, investors will want to wait for other signals to confirm. For example, the sharp drop in the stock price pushed the MACD line below the signal line, and the chart shows that momentum is becoming increasingly bearish. The daily volume is more than double the average daily volume, showing that investors are selling first and asking questions later. This means that patience will be required before timing an entry. The 50-day SMA is flattening and starting to curl lower, putting the stock close to a bearish death cross formation that occurs when the 50-day SMA crosses below its 200-day SMA.

Netflix Bulls vs. Bears: Who Wins This Pullback?,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/netflix-bulls-vs-bears-who-wins-this-pullback/,"Shares of streaming giant Netflix Inc NASDAQ: NFLX closed Wednesday just below the $1,180 mark, leaving the stock roughly 15% off its early-July peak. That stumble starkly contrasts with the S&P 500’s nearly 3% gain over the same stretch. The divergence is striking, puzzling, and potentially worrying - all at the same time. It will also be a bitter pill for investors enjoying one of the cleanest multi-year rallies among the big tech names. Still, there are reasons to think we’re looking at a golden entry opportunity. Let’s look at two of the top reasons to be brave and one that says to still be wary. Starting with the fundamentals, last month’s report smashed expectations. Revenue was up nearly 16% yearly, and earnings per share surpassed the consensus. Going further, Netflix’s management shared fresh revenue and EPS guidance that also came in hot - a move that Wall Street usually loves to see. Behind those headline beats were a couple of standout drivers. For example, Netflix’s fledgling advertising segment is scaling faster than many expected, and already appears robust even if it’s still small in the grand scheme of things. The company’s growth across regions was fairly broad, and its dabbling into live streaming appears to be paying off already. These all helped to send the company’s operating margin to a record high of 34%, helped along by solid content cost leverage. It remains one of the world’s most recognizable brands, has proven capable of innovating and pivoting successfully, and is adding subscribers at a considerable clip. For investors who’ve been watching the stock rally for a while and were too cautious to chase an entry, this 15% haircut could be the perfect entry point. Backing up the theory that we could be looking at a golden opportunity is the fact that analyst sentiment remains overwhelmingly bullish. As Bank of America said after the report, “Netflix remains among the best-positioned companies in media and entertainment with sustainable growth drivers that should prove predictable and defensive amid a wide range of macroeconomic scenarios”. And they’re not the only ones. Multiple analysts reiterated positive views after the print, many nudging targets higher to reflect stronger optimism and belief in Netflix’s potential. Robert Baird, for example, reiterated its Outperform rating while upping its price target to $1,500, matching the update from both Needham and Jefferies. Meanwhile, the team at Wells Fargo moved their price target on Netflix up to $1,560—close to a street high. From where the stock closed on Wednesday, that’s not only pointing to a targeted upside of more than 30%, but suggesting Netflix shares could be back cruising through all-time highs very soon. However, it has to be noted that not everyone is convinced that this is a no-brainer. Amidst the gushing analyst support following last month’s report, there was at least one team that raised a big, bright red flag. Phillip Securities downgraded its rating to Strong Sell, arguing that the report wasn’t good enough to justify the rally, and that valuation was becoming a genuine concern. With a pre-earnings report price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of almost 60, compared to the 40 it was around 12 months previously, it’s hard to argue with them. Phillip Securities analyst Helena Wang remains cautious on the company’s long-term growth potential, but feels there’s a much bigger correction needed to get the stock back to a healthy level from which to build again. Her $950 price target is a testament to this, which, even with the 15% drop over the past few weeks, suggests Netflix could easily fall another 20% or so. Wednesday’s 2.7% rise in the stock shows there’s still strong demand, with buyers already stepping in. It looks like an early rejection of the bears’ attempt to push the stock below Tuesday’s low. If Netflix can hold above the $1,150 level through week’s end, expect bearish momentum to fade fast. Before you consider Netflix, you'll want to hear this."

"Trump removes Billy Long as IRS commissioner, giving him the shortest-ever tenure in the role",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-removes-billy-long-as-irs-commisioner-less-than-2-months-after-his-confirmation-2025-08-08/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has removed former U.S. Rep. Billy Long as IRS commissioner less than two months after his confirmation, a White House official said Friday. It was not immediately clear why Long was dismissed. His quick exit makes him the shortest-tenured IRS commissioner confirmed by the Senate since the position was created in 1862. Long said in a social media post that Trump had nominated him for an ambassadorship. “It is a honor to serve my friend President Trump and I am excited to take on my new role as the ambassador to Iceland. I am thrilled to answer his call to service and deeply committed to advancing his bold agenda. Exciting times ahead!” the former Missouri congressman wrote on X. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will serve as acting IRS commissioner, according to the White House official, who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Long’s ouster only compounds the turmoil at the nation’s tax collector, which has been beset by turnover since the beginning of Trump’s second term. The IRS shuffled through four acting leaders before Long was confirmed in June and has lost a quarter of its staff since the Department of Government Efficiency burrowed in in a self-stated mission to reduce waste, fraud and abuse. In a message to IRS employees after he was confirmed, Long talked about his plans for his first few months in office, a milestone he did not reach. ""In my first 90 days I plan to ask you, my employee partners, to help me develop a new culture here,” Long wrote. “I’m big on culture, and I’m anxious to develop one that makes your lives and the taxpayers’ lives better.” In many ways, he was an unusual pick for the role. While in Congress, where he served from 2011 to 2023, Long sponsored legislation to get rid of the IRS. A former auctioneer, Long had no background in tax administration. The Senate confirmed Long on a 53-44 vote despite Democrats’ concerns about the Republican’s past work for a firm that pitched a fraud-ridden coronavirus pandemic-era tax break and about campaign contributions he received after Trump nominated him. After leaving Congress to mount an unsuccessful 2022 bid for the U.S. Senate, Long worked with a firm that distributed the pandemic-era employee retention tax credit. That tax credit program was eventually shut down after then-IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel determined that it was fraudulent. Democrats called for a criminal investigation into Long’s connections to other alleged tax credit loopholes. The lawmakers allege that firms connected to Long duped investors into spending millions of dollars to purchase fake tax credits. The acting Ieaders who preceded Long in the role included one who resigned over a deal between the IRS and the Department of Homeland Security to share immigrants’ tax data with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and another whose appointment led to a fight between former Trump adviser Elon Musk and Bessent. Long's departure comes after the agency underwent a series of DOGE-related job cuts this year. The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration reports that the agency has been cut down from 103,000 workers in January to 77,000 workers in May 2025. Most of the reductions came from DOGE's deferred resignation program. The workforce reductions were part of the Trump administration’s efforts to shrink the size of the federal bureaucracy."

FAFSA application is open for early testing. Here's what to know.,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/fafsa-application-is-open-for-early-testing-heres-what-to-know-2025-08-08/,"NEW YORK (AP) — The Free Application for Federal Student Aid for the 2026-27 school year has opened for a limited number of students as part of a beta test, the Department of Education says. The department is rolling out two beta testing phases before the application is fully available to everyone in October. At first, the FAFSA form will be available for a small number of students and families, chosen via existing partnerships with community organizations and schools. “We're using this time to monitor a limited number of FAFSA submissions to ensure our systems are performing as expected,” the department said on Monday. In September, students will be able to request participation in the second phase of beta testing. Participation will be limited, so not everyone will be accepted, said the Education Department. Here's what you need to know. The FAFSA is a free government application that uses students’ and their families’ financial information to determine whether they can get financial aid from the federal government to pay for college. The application will send a student’s financial information to the schools they are interested in attending. The amount of financial aid a student receives depends on each institution. The application is also used to determine eligibility for other federal student aid programs, like work-study and loans, as well as state and school aid.

Viasat: Why a Wall of Cash Has Shorts Running for Cover,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/viasat-why-a-wall-of-cash-has-shorts-running-for-cover/,"For months, satellite communications company Viasat NASDAQ: VSAT was a classic battleground stock, attracting a significant number of investors betting against it. A long-standing narrative focused on the company’s heavy debt load and the rising threat of competition. But in a stunning two-day surge, Viasat’s stock price soared over 22% on explosive trading volume, signaling that the tide may be turning. The catalyst was a first-quarter earnings report that not only beat expectations but also challenged the very foundation of the current bearish sentiment. This set off a frantic rally as short-sellers, who had borrowed shares to bet on a price drop, were forced to buy them back. The key question for investors now is whether this was a momentary, technically driven short squeeze or the beginning of a meaningful and sustainable re-rating of a global communications sector powerhouse. The spark that ignited Viasat’s rally was its first-quarter fiscal year 2026 financial report. The company posted a non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $0.17, decisively crushing the Viasat analyst community’s estimates of a $0.15 loss. Revenue also came in strong at $1.17 billion, sailing past forecasts. But the most important number in the report was not about earnings; it was about cash. Viasat generated $60 million in positive free cash flow, a remarkable $210 million improvement year-over-year. Free cash flow, the cash a company produces after accounting for capital expenditures, is a critical indicator of financial health. For a company like Viasat, which operates in a capital-intensive industry and carries substantial debt, this shift is a game-changer. It signals that the period of heavy investment may be cresting, allowing the company to begin harvesting returns, paying down debt, and funding its growth without relying on external financing. This performance was supported by clear evidence of improved capital discipline: This potent combination of growing cash flow and reduced spending directly addresses the primary concern that has weighed on the stock: its $6.7 billion debt load. By demonstrating an ability to generate its funding, Viasat has presented a credible path to deleveraging its balance sheet and achieving greater financial stability. While the market was focused on debt, Viasat’s core business segments were building significant momentum. The recent earnings report has forced investors to recognize the powerful growth engines that form the foundation of the company’s value proposition. The standout performer is Viasat's Defense and Advanced Technologies (DAT) segment. Often described as the company's crown jewel, this division provides secure, high-tech communications for government and military clients. Its latest performance was exceptional: This high-margin defense business offers a stable, expanding revenue base built on long-term government contracts. Its strength is a key reason why activist investors have argued the segment’s actual value is obscured within the larger company. At the same time, Viasat’s commercial aviation business is capitalizing on the global recovery of the travel sector. The in-flight connectivity division saw service revenue grow 14% as more aircraft were equipped with its systems. A new partnership with LATAM Group NYSE: LTM underscores its continued success in securing major, long-term airline contracts, locking in future revenue. With a strong quarter in the books, several key catalysts are on the horizon that could sustain the stock's upward momentum. First is the imminent expansion of its global satellite network. Viasat has confirmed that its ViaSat-3 F2 satellite is expected to ship to the launch site by September 2025. This satellite, covering Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, along with the subsequent Asia-Pacific satellite, will dramatically increase Viasat's available bandwidth. This new capacity will enable it to offer higher speeds and connect more devices simultaneously, opening up new revenue opportunities in its lucrative aviation, maritime, and government markets. Second, the company is nearing the finalization of a settlement with Ligado Networks. Pending court approval, this agreement is expected to provide Viasat with a new, high-margin revenue stream starting with quarterly payments of approximately $16 million. This potential income has not yet been factored into the company's financial guidance, representing a source of future upside. Finally, Viasat has a clear plan to use its financial strength to create a virtuous cycle. Management has stated that its priority is to use its growing free cash flow to pay down debt. This will not only strengthen the balance sheet but also reduce interest expenses, which in turn will free up even more cash for growth and further deleveraging. Viasat's recent rally appears to be more than a temporary, squeeze-driven event. It is rooted in a fundamental improvement in the company's financial trajectory, marked by a decisive turn toward generating, not consuming, cash. Investors are now recognizing the true value of its resilient defense and growing aviation businesses. With major operational catalysts on the horizon and a clear strategy to fortify its balance sheet, the evidence suggests this is the beginning of a durable and positive shift in the Viasat story. Before you consider Viasat, you'll want to hear this."

"A Florida woman posed as a nurse and treated thousands of unsuspecting patients, officials say",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/a-florida-woman-posed-as-a-nurse-and-treated-thousands-of-unsuspecting-patients-officials-say-2025-08-08/,"PALM COAST, Fla. (AP) — A Florida woman is accused of posing as a licensed nurse and giving medical care to thousands of patients, authorities said. Autumn Marie Bardisa, 29, of Palm Coast, participated in medical services involving 4,486 people from June 2024 until January 2025, the Flagler County Sheriff's Office said. “This is one of the most disturbing cases of medical fraud we’ve ever investigated,” Flagler County Sheriff Rick Staly said in announcing the arrest. Bardisa was apprehended in the driveway of her home Tuesday and is jailed on multiple charges that include practicing health care without a license, sheriff's officials said. She's being held on $70,000 bond and is due in court for a Sept. 2 arraignment. No lawyer who could speak on behalf of Bardisa was listed in local court records. The sheriff’s office said Bardisa used another health care worker's license number and submitted false documentation in order to be employed as an advanced nurse technician at AdventHealth Palm Coast Parkway in Palm Coast. “This woman potentially put thousands of lives at risk by pretending to be someone she was not and violating the trust of patients, their families, AdventHealth and an entire medical community,"" Staly said. Officials say they've set up a special email, fakenursecase@flaglersheriff.com, and are asking anyone who thinks they might have been a victim in the case to email the sheriff's office. Palm Coast is about 60 miles (97 kilometers) south of Jacksonville, Florida."
Mexican authorities accuse Adidas of cultural appropriation in their sandal design,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/mexican-authorities-accuse-adidas-of-cultural-appropriation-over-new-sandal-design-2025-08-08/,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexican authorities are accusing sportswear company Adidas of plagiarizing artisans in southern Mexico, alleging that a new sandal design is strikingly similar to the traditional Indigenous footwear known as huaraches. The controversy has fueled accusations of cultural appropriation by the footwear brand, with authorities saying this is not the first time traditional Mexican handicrafts have been copied. Citing these concerns, local authorities have asked Adidas to withdraw the shoe model. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said on Friday that Adidas was already in talks with authorities in the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca to provide “compensation for the people who were plagiarized,"" and that her government was preparing legal reforms to prevent the copying of Mexican handicrafts. The design at the center of the controversy is the “Oaxaca Slip-On,"" a sandal created by U.S. designer Willy Chavarría for Adidas Originals. The sandals feature thin leather straps braided in a style that is unmistakably similar to the traditional Mexican huaraches. Instead of flat leather soles, the Adidas shoes tout a more chunky, sports shoe sole. According to Mexican authorities, Adidas' design contains elements that are part of the cultural heritage of the Zapotec Indigenous communities in Oaxaca, particularly in the town of Villa Hidalgo de Yalálag. Handicrafts are a crucial economic lifeline in Mexico, providing jobs for around half a million people across the country. The industry accounts for around 10% of the gross domestic product of states like Oaxaca, Jalisco, Michoacán and Guerrero. For Viridiana Jarquín García, a huaraches creator and vendor in Oaxaca's capital, the Adidas shoes were a “cheap copy” of the kind of work that Mexican artists take time and care to craft. “The artistry is being lost. We're losing our tradition,"" she said in front of her small booth of leather shoes. Authorities in Oaxaca have called for the “Oaxaca Slip-On” to be withdrawn and demanded a public apology from Adidas, with officials describing the design as “cultural appropriation"" that may violate Mexican law. In a public letter to Adidas leadership, Oaxaca state Gov. Salomón Jara Cruz criticized the company’s design, saying that “creative inspiration” is not a valid justification for using cultural expressions that “provide identity to communities.” “Culture isn't sold, it's respected,” he added. Adidas responded in a letter Friday afternoon, saying that the company “deeply values the cultural wealth of Mexico’s Indigenous people and recognizes the relevance” of the criticisms. It requested to sit down with local officials and to discuss how it can “repair the damage” to Indigenous populations. The controversy follows years of efforts by Mexico's government and artisans to push back on major global clothing brands who they say copy traditional designs. In 2021, the federal government asked manufacturers including Zara, Anthropologie and Patowl to provide a public explanation for why they copied clothing designs from Oaxaca's Indigenous communities to sell in their stores. Now, Mexican authorities say they're trying to work out stricter regulations in an effort to protect artists. But Marina Núñez, Mexico's undersecretary of cultural development, noted that they also want to establish guidelines to not deprive artists of “the opportunity to trade or collaborate with several of these companies that have very broad commercial reach."" ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america"
Dutch Bros Just Flipped the Script With a Massive Earnings Beat,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/dutch-bros-just-flipped-the-script-with-a-massive-earnings-beat/,"Who needs coffee? Dutch Bros Inc. NYSE: BROS is giving investors a rush as BROS stock is up over 20% in mid-day trading after the company delivered a strong earnings report after the market closed on August 6. The headline numbers were impressive in and of themselves. Dutch Bros reported $415.81 million in revenue, topping the $403.24 million forecasted. The number was also 27.9% higher year-over-year (YOY). The same was true of earnings per share (EPS), which came in at 26 cents, beating expectations by 44%. The number was also 36.8% higher YOY. Dutch Bros also raised its full-year revenue and earnings guidance. The company now expects to deliver $1.59 billion to $1.60 billion in revenue and $285 million to $290 million in adjusted EBITDA. BROS stock was already up approximately 20% in 2025 before the earnings report. This reflected investor enthusiasm for the company’s expansion plans and strong financials. However, the stock was down more than 10% in the month before earnings. It continued to drop after Starbucks Corp. NASDAQ: SBUX delivered a mixed earnings report. Stocks in the same sector, in this case retail stocks, especially mid- and small-caps, often trade in sympathy with larger peers, particularly with institutional funds that reweight baskets. That’s where the opportunity lies. Although its fans may disagree, Dutch Bros still has challenger brand status compared to Starbucks, which is still perceived as the category leader. That’s OK. Investors of a certain age remember that Avis built its company as a challenger brand to industry leader, Hertz. But while the two companies may trade together, their business models and trajectories are quite different. Dutch Bros is earlier in its growth curve, and that gives it a unique edge that Starbucks no longer carries. For example, Dutch Bros opened 31 new locations in the quarter, including entering its 19th state. It also reiterated its outlook that it will open 160 locations in 2025 with a long-term goal of having over 2,000 locations by 2029. And, unlike Starbucks, which reported a same-store sales decline of around 3%, Dutch Bros delivered 6.1% same-store sales growth in the quarter. Dutch Bros is also leaning into a younger demographic audience, which is partially reflected in the company’s drive-thru-only business model. After such a strong run-up in 2025, some investors may wonder if BROS stock has limited upside. There are at least two reasons to believe it may have room to run. First, it’s nearly impossible not to notice the dramatic YOY free cash flow (FCF) growth. In the quarter, Dutch Bros reported $46 million in FCF. In the same quarter in 2025, it posted a $32 million cash burn. That’s a $78 million swing and a strong indicator that the company is now delivering profitable growth with operating leverage. Investors can also look at the Dutch Bros analyst forecasts on MarketBeat. The stock has a consensus price target of $77.82, which is a 13% gain. Within 24 hours of the earnings report, four analysts raised their price targets on BROS stock. Three of them now see the stock trading above the current consensus price. After weeks of trending lower into the earnings report, BROS stock has surged above its 50-day simple moving average (SMA), a key technical milestone that signals renewed bullish momentum. Confirming the bullish move is the bullish crossover in the moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) indicator. That 50-day line now acts as near-term support. There could be resistance in the $73-$75 range, where the stock peaked in June. However, technicians often say, “The longer the base, the stronger the breakout.” BROS has been consolidating since June, so if it can push above that level, a retest of the $80 high could be in sight. Before you consider Dutch Bros, you'll want to hear this."
Is Eli Lilly’s 14% Post-Earnings Slide a Buy-the-Dip Opportunity?,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/is-eli-lillys-14-post-earnings-slide-a-buy-the-dip-opportunity/,"For weight loss drug leaders, the last two weeks have been nothing short of disastrous for shares. Industry pioneer Novo Nordisk A/S NYSE: NVO saw its stock drop nearly 22% on July 29 after lowering its full-year guidance. Then, on Aug. 7, Eli Lilly NYSE: LLY shares fell approximately 14%. The reasoning, however, behind Eli Lilly's decline was much different than Novo's, as the company crushed estimates on its Q2 earnings. So, what really drove the stock’s plunge, and does it open up a potential opportunity for investors? Lilly’s Q2 earnings, released on Aug. 7, came in strong. The company posted sales growth of $15.6 billion, an increase of 38%. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) climbed by 61% to $6.31. Both of these figures handily beat out Wall Street estimates. Lilly continued to grow its lead on Novo Nordisk in the weight loss drug space, gaining 3.8% market share in the United States. To top it all off, Lilly increased its full-year 2025 guidance by $1.5 billion at the midpoint. But these impressive results were completely overshadowed by a far more disappointing development: clinical trial data. Alongside earnings, Lilly revealed the latest clinical data on the company’s next-generation solution for the weight loss drug market, orforglipron. Orforglipron is a pill, rather than an injectable like the products that currently dominate. Many have seen it as Lilly's next potential blockbuster drug, as a considerable number of potential patients prefer pills over needles. Attracting a big new market through orforglipron could add significant upside to Lilly shares as the company diversifies its offerings. However, markets appear to be very disappointed with the new data. Orforglipron’s Phase 3 ATTAIN-1 results showed that patients lost an average of 11.5% of their weight compared to the placebo at 72 weeks. Although this is a solid weight loss for an oral GLP-1, it fell significantly below the company’s 2023 findings. Those results showed orforglipron could achieve a placebo-adjusted weight loss of 12.4% at just 36 weeks. Analysts thought the amount of weight loss might increase in ATTAIN-1, as the study period was twice as long. Instead, weight loss fell. These results also fell below the 12.7% placebo-adjusted weight loss that Novo Nordisk achieved with its oral GLP-1 at 68 weeks. Ultimately, the orforglipron data showed that Lilly isn’t immune to posting disappointing weight-loss efficacy. This puts a crack in one of the key elements driving gains in Lilly shares: its pattern of displaying scientific dominance. As markets look forward, it's possible that other GLP-1 makers could create drugs that are better than Lilly’s. This was always the case, but the orforglipron data brings that painful reality to the forefront. More immediately, the results also damage investors' perception of how successful a product orforglipron can be. Overall, these factors are what led to the massive drop in shares. Although the orforglipron data was disappointing, it is certainly possible that Lilly’s sell-off is overdone. Lilly’s Chief Scientific Officer, Daniel M. Skovronsky, said that Wall Street is overly focused on weight loss efficacy hitting an exact number. He reiterated that even if a particular trial does not meet Wall Street expectations, that drug can still see strong demand in the real world. With orforglipron, Lilly is trying to reach a new patient group that doesn’t want to use injectables. Lower-than-expected efficacy certainly lowers the sales expectations for orforglipron, but it doesn’t take away the fact that Lilly still has a massive untapped opportunity with the drug. Lilly plans to submit orforglipron for regulatory approval by the end of 2025 and potentially start sales in 2026. However, there is a risk. Novo Nordisk’s oral GLP-1, which appears to be more efficacious, is currently under regulatory review. If approved, it could give the company a first-mover advantage over Lilly. Still, injectable data shows that there is room for multiple oral GLP-1s to thrive. Novo holds a 42% market share in the United States, despite its injectables being much less efficacious than Lilly’s. This suggests that Lilly can still find a significant market with orforglipron if regulators approve it. With weight loss drugs still being highly underpenetrated, the company has a long runway for growth. Lilly’s fall despite robust earnings could be a fruitful buy-the-dip opportunity. Notably, Leerink Partners' new $715 price target implies 11% upside versus the Aug. 7 close. Before you consider Eli Lilly and Company, you'll want to hear this."
4 arrested in Brazilian police raids against gang running illegal ride-hailing app in Rio,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/4-arrested-in-brazilian-police-raids-against-gang-running-illegal-ride-hailing-app-in-rio-2025-08-08/,"SAO PAULO (AP) — Police in Rio de Janeiro carried out raids against a criminal group Friday that allegedly operated a clandestine ride-hailing app that generated monthly profits of up to 1 million reais (about $185,000), authorities said. At least four people were arrested. Officials said in a statement that Comando Vermelho, one of Brazil’s most notorious criminal organizations, coerced motorcycle drivers into installing a ride-hailing app developed by the group and using it in Vila Kennedy, a neighborhood in Rio de Janeiro. More than 300 drivers were registered with the app, and the revenue was funneled through shell companies to finance drug trafficking operations. Police have arrested four people so far and executed 12 search and seizure warrants in Rio and neighboring cities. Authorities said the ride-hailing operation was run by two well-structured groups: one that threatened and extorted drivers, and another that collected the profits and transferred them to the local drug lord. Comando Vermelho, which translates to Red Command in English, is one of Brazil’s oldest and largest criminal gangs. Originating in Rio de Janeiro’s prison system in the late 1970s, the group has expanded its operations into other criminal businesses, including international cocaine trafficking, and it also controls territory in several of Rio’s working-class neighborhoods. Armed groups that dominate these areas often manage basic services such as gas, internet and transportation. Brazilian media recently reported that Comando Vermelho has banned the use of popular ride-hailing apps like Uber and 99 from operating in certain areas. Motorcycle taxis are a longstanding and popular mode of transportation in Rio and other Brazilian cities. Uber launched its motorcycle ride service in Rio in January 2023 and, two years later, the company said in a statement that it had transported 3 million users and registered 100,000 drivers. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america"
Tesla Is Balanced on a Knife Edge: Time to Tread Carefully,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/tesla-is-balanced-on-a-knife-edge-time-to-tread-carefully/,"Shares of auto-giant Tesla Inc NASDAQ: TSLA popped more than 3.5% on Aug. 6, snapping a mini losing streak and reigniting hopes that a bullish breakout is just around the corner. The stock has continued to trade within a tightening pennant pattern for the past few weeks. Wednesday's move adds more tension to what's becoming one of the more interesting technical setups among the mega-cap stocks. It's a classic inflection point. On one hand, the bulls are confident that Tesla's recent earnings, improving margins, and product roadmap will be enough to push shares higher again. However, the bears have plenty of ammunition of their own; ongoing concerns around free cash flow, brand damage, and now even legal risks. With the odds of a breakout soaring, both sides have reasons to believe it will be in their favor. For investors on the sidelines thinking about getting involved, it's time to be extra cautious. Starting with the positives, Tesla's most recent earnings report, while not without its flaws, was stronger than many feared. Revenue did decline, but not as sharply as expected, and operating margins showed a modest rebound from previous quarters. Crucially, CEO Elon Musk struck an optimistic tone on the company's forward roadmap, reiterating timelines for new vehicle launches and autonomous capabilities. Additionally, from a technical perspective, the April uptrend remains intact. Even with lower highs appearing since June, the upward price action hasn't broken down. That's a testament to investors' appetite to buy into every dip and suggests that the bulls are still in control of the broader trend, for now at least. There's also the fact that analysts continue to broadly back the long-term story. Several, like the team over at Wedbush on Monday, have been reiterating their Buy ratings in recent weeks, pointing to Tesla's scale advantages in EV manufacturing, software-driven margins, and potential upside from AI and robotics. And as the stock's pennant formation compresses further each day, a decisive move above resistance would probably trigger a surge of momentum buying. However, at the same time, things aren't all clear skies for Tesla. The bears will point to a number of red flags that the market is underappreciating and appears to be getting redder. Take the company's operating income, which fell 42% last quarter, and its free cash flow, which plunged close to 90%. These numbers raise serious questions about sustainability, especially given Tesla's elevated valuation. The recent rally, now up 50% from the April low, may be pricing in too much optimism too soon. Then there's the mounting concern around Tesla's robotaxi ambitions. What was supposed to be Musk's centerpiece update this summer has been overshadowed by fresh legal risk. Earlier this week, shareholders filed a class-action lawsuit accusing Tesla of hiding safety issues tied to its autonomous vehicles, including robotaxis. That's a reputational hit Tesla can ill afford, especially as it grapples with the fallout from Musk's polarizing political presence. In Germany, one of Tesla's key European markets, new electric vehicle registrations surged 58% last month, yet Tesla's registrations fell more than 50% over the same period. It's a stark divergence that suggests the brand may be losing its appeal just as competition intensifies. There's a growing sense that real friction is emerging in the company's growth engine, as well as rising tariffs and broader political headwinds. So, all that being said, the current setup leaves Tesla teetering on a knife-edge. The bulls have a technical case and a long-term vision, but it could be argued that the bears are winning the fundamental argument for now. The fact that the stock remains in a holding pattern, even as both sides lob headlines and forecasts back and forth, says a lot. What matters now is the next move. If Tesla can break above the upper boundary of its pennant, around the $330 level, with substantial volume, it would likely reestablish bullish momentum and open the door to new highs. But a breakdown below support would flip the script entirely, and could quickly turn into a deeper correction. For investors, the key is to stay patient and avoid getting caught in the noise. This is a time to watch closely, manage risk, and await confirmation. The next breakout will likely be hard and fast, whichever way it goes. Before you consider Tesla, you'll want to hear this."

Why Axon's 16% Surge Signals a New Era in Public Safety Tech,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/why-axons-16-surge-signals-a-new-era-in-public-safety-tech/,"In a decisive session that caught investors' attention, shares of Axon Enterprise NASDAQ: AXON climbed by 16.41% on August 5, 2025. The stock closed at a new 52-week high of $867.12 on a wave of trading activity nearly four times its daily average, a clear signal of powerful investor conviction. While a first-rate second-quarter earnings report triggered the move, the story runs so much deeper. This rally represents the market's roaring endorsement of Axon's successful multi-year transformation from a well-known hardware company into an indispensable public safety software platform. Axon’s financial release surpassed its analyst community’s expectations. The company reported an adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.12, exceeding analyst forecasts of around $1.54 by a large margin. This impressive profit was built on a foundation of strong revenue growth that showcased the fundamental health of the business. Wall Street's response was swift and affirmative. In the hours following the report, Craig-Hallum upgraded its rating on the stock from Hold to Buy, and Bank of America raised its price target to an eye-watering $1,000 per share. This chorus of validation shows that institutional investors are looking beyond the quarterly numbers and are rewarding the flawless execution of a powerful long-term strategy. The core reason for investor excitement is found in the composition of Axon’s growth. The company’s Software & Services segment has officially become its primary growth engine, with revenue climbing an accelerated 39% year over year. For comparison, the Connected Devices segment, which includes the iconic TASER product, grew at a healthy but more moderate 29%. This divergence is the intended result of Axon’s strategic pivot toward a more profitable and predictable business model. Investors prize software subscriptions because they generate recurring revenue, which is far more stable than one-time hardware sales. Two key metrics from Axon's report highlight why this model is so powerful: Axon's strategy revolves around building a sticky ecosystem that becomes indispensable to its clients. When a police department deploys Axon's body cameras, the video data flows directly into its Evidence.com cloud platform. From there, agencies can integrate a full suite of workflow tools, like Axon Records for digital report filing and Axon Respond for real-time situational awareness. This deep integration creates a powerful competitive moat; the operational cost and complexity for an agency to switch to a different provider become extremely high. This captive audience provides a vast runway for future growth. In a key disclosure from Axon’s earnings call, its management noted that approximately 70% of its law enforcement customers are still on basic software plans. This single data point highlights a significant, multi-year opportunity for Axon to upsell these agencies to more advanced, higher-margin software tiers. This scalable platform is also the launchpad for a multi-pronged expansion strategy. Axon is leveraging its ecosystem to push into new frontiers, including deploying artificial intelligence (AI) tools like ""Draft One"" to automate paperwork and expanding its footprint in international, federal, and private enterprise markets. Following its recent rally, Axon trades at a high price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) above 200. This premium valuation directly reflects the market reclassifying Axon from a hardware company to a high-growth platform company, a category that consistently earns higher multiples. Investors are pricing in the company's future potential, a strategy that is strongly supported by the financial data. The company's elite recurring revenue metrics, dominant competitive position, and clearly defined growth paths strongly justify this optimistic outlook. Furthermore, Axon's decision to raise its full-year 2025 revenue and profitability guidance signals management's confidence in its continued execution. The story behind the 16% surge is not about one quarter of success but about the market's validation of a business model transformation that is now firing on all cylinders.

"Boar's Head plans to reopen troubled deli meat plant, but reports of sanitation problems persist",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/boars-head-plans-to-reopen-troubled-deli-meat-plant-but-reports-of-sanitation-problems-persist-2025-08-08/,"The Boar's Head deli meat plant at the heart of last year's deadly food poisoning outbreak is set to reopen in the coming months, company officials said. But recent inspections at Boar’s Head sites in three states documented sanitation problems similar to those that led to the listeria contamination that killed 10 people and sickened dozens. The Jarratt, Virginia, plant was shut down in September when U.S. Agriculture Department officials suspended operations and withdrew the federal marks of inspection required to operate, saying the company “failed to maintain sanitary conditions.” Boar’s Head permanently stopped making liverwurst and recalled more than 7 million pounds of deli products. USDA officials this week said they had “thoroughly reviewed” the plant and lifted the forced suspension on July 18. “The facility is in full compliance of the guidelines and protocols set for the safe handling and production of food and the serious issues that led to suspension have been fully rectified,” officials with the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service said in an email Wednesday. And yet, documents obtained by The Associated Press through a freedom of information request show that Boar’s Head plants in Arkansas, Indiana and elsewhere in Virginia were flagged for the same kinds of sanitation problems that led to the outbreak, with the most recent report in June. In the past seven months, government inspectors reported problems that include instances of meat and fat residue left on equipment and walls, drains blocked with meat products, beaded condensation on ceilings and floors, overflowing trash cans, and staff who didn’t wear protective hairnets and plastic aprons — or wash their hands. The records, which included USDA noncompliance reports logged by inspectors from Jan. 1 through July 23, raise new questions about the company's promises to address systemic problems and about federal oversight of listeria contamination in plants that make ready-to-eat foods. “If there is evidence that food safety problems are continuing, the government needs to make sure the company fixes them,” said Sandra Eskin, a former USDA official who now heads STOP Foodborne Illness, a consumer group focused on food safety. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins last month announced plans to bolster efforts that combat foodborne germs, including listeria. Officials at Boar's Head, the 120-year-old company based in Sarasota, Florida, have posted job openings for two dozen positions, including a food safety quality analyst, at the Jarratt site. The company convened a panel of expert advisers last fall and hired a chief food safety officer in May. The advisers include Frank Yiannas, a former U.S. Food and Drug Administration official, and Mindy Brashears, President Donald Trump's nominee for USDA's undersecretary for food safety. Boar's Head last year said they “regret and deeply apologize"" for the contamination and that “comprehensive measures are being implemented to prevent such an incident from ever happening again.” But company officials refused to discuss the problems found this year. They canceled a scheduled AP interview with Natalie Dyenson, the new food safety officer. And they declined to allow Yiannas to detail the investigation he led into the contamination's cause. Brashears, who now directs a food safety center at Texas Tech University, did not respond to requests for comment about the Boar's Head problems. An automatic email reply said the USDA nominee was traveling out of the country until Aug. 25. She remains on the company's food safety board. “Boar’s Head has an unwavering commitment to food safety and quality. That commitment is reflected in recent enhancements to our practices and protocols"" described on the company's website, Boar's Head said in an emailed statement. ""We have also been working with the USDA in developing a plan to reopen our Jarratt facility in a measured, deliberate way in the coming months,” the statement said. The 35 pages of new inspection findings cover Boar's Head sites in Forrest City, Arkansas; New Castle, Indiana; and Petersburg, Virginia. They surprised outside food safety advocates, who said that factory conditions should have improved in the year since the outbreak was first identified. “You would have expected after all they went through that they would put themselves in a place where you could essentially eat deli meat off the factory floor,” said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports, an advocacy group. Rep. Rosa DeLauro called the findings “appalling.” “This is a pattern of negligence — cutting corners to protect the company’s bottom line at the expense of consumers and these conditions show a complete disregard for food safety and for the public health of the American people,” the Connecticut Democrat said in a statement. The findings echo the “inadequate sanitation practices” that USDA officials said contributed to the outbreak. Key factors included product residue, condensation and structural problems in the buildings, a January report concluded. At the Jarratt plant, state inspectors working in partnership with USDA had documented mold, insects, liquid dripping from ceilings, and meat and fat residue on walls, floors and equipment, the AP previously reported. While no instances of insects were documented in this year's inspection reports, there were repeated reports of “dried fat and protein from the previous day's production” on equipment, stairs and walls. In April, an inspector at the Petersburg plant reported finding discarded meat underneath equipment, including “5-6 hams, 4 large pieces of meat and a large quantity of pooling meat juice.” Other reports detailed beaded condensation “directly over the food contact surfaces of tables and conveyor belts.” Additional reports documented rusting meat racks, doors that failed to close completely and staff who ignored required handwashing stations. The reports point to a “food safety culture problem,” said Barbara Kowalcyk, who directs a food safety and nutrition security center at George Washington University. “What jumped out to me is there is an organizational culture issue that needs to be changed,” she said. “Usually that culture has to start at the top.” In the meantime, she advised consumers to think carefully about deli meat consumption. Older people and those who are pregnant or have weakened immune systems are especially vulnerable to serious illness from listeria infections. “I think they need to be aware that there are issues at this organization that still are not completely under control, apparently,” Kowalcyk said. Boar's Head faced multiple lawsuits from people who fell ill or from the families of those who died. Several survivors declined to comment publicly on the new problems, citing financial settlements with the company that included nondisclosure agreements. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
