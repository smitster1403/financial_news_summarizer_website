The pain was even more pronounced in the broader market, with the Midcap and Smallcap 100 indices seeing deeper losses. At about 11:30 am, the Sensex was down 407.80 points or 0.49 percent at 82,318.84, and the Nifty was down 114.30 points or 0.45 percent at 25,105.60.

Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates The recent wave of US trade agreements is gradually easing fears of tariff wars. While global trade has taken a hit this year and economic growth is expected to remain subdued at around 2.8 percent, equity markets are beginning to price in a recovery in trade and growth by 2026. This optimism is contributing to the ongoing resilience and uptrend in global equities. In the US, strong corporate earnings are providing fundamental support to the market, V K Vijayakumar of Geojit Investments Limited said. He added that, on the institutional front, foreign investors have turned consistent sellers in the cash market, even as they continue to participate actively in primary issuances. The primary driver of this selling pressure is India's high valuations, especially when compared to relatively more attractive pricing in other global markets.

Nifty IT led the losses, falling 1.66 percent, followed by Nifty Realty and Nifty Smallcap 100, down 1.08 percent and 0.69 percent, respectively. The Nifty Midcap 100 also slipped 0.57 percent. Among other laggards were Nifty Energy, FMCG, and PSU Bank indices, all trading in the red. On the positive side, Nifty Pharma rose 0.33 percent, Nifty Auto gained 0.31 percent, and Consumer Durables edged up 0.19 percent. Volatility ticked up slightly, with India VIX rising 0.76 percent to 10.60. Persistent Systems Ltd tumbled 7 percent after posting its earnings for the quarter ended June 30, 2025 which came in under expectations in an uncertain macro environment. Persistent Systems' revenue for the quarter grew 3.9 percent or 3.3 percent in constant currency terms to $389.7 million. The revenue growth was led by the BFSI arm, (up 9 percent QoQ) and Software, Hi-Tech & Emerging Industries (up 3.6 percent), while Healthcare & Lifesciences (down 1.9 percent) saw a decline, primarily due to planned offshore shift at some of the large customers. Indian Energy Exchange Ltd (IEX) sank 20 percent after reports suggested that the Central Regulatory Electricity Commission approved the implementation of power coupling with the Day Ahead Market (DAM). As part of the first phase of the new regulations, the Day-Ahead Market (DAM) will be coupled by January 2026. In this system, various power exchanges will take turns serving as Market Coupling Operators (MCOs) through a round-robin arrangement.

The brokerage noted that while Trent’s value fashion brand Zudio continues to grow faster than the broader apparel market, the pace of market share gains may be slower than previously anticipated. Trent, which operates Westside and Zudio stores, had earlier reported a 20 percent year-on-year rise in revenue for the quarter ended June in its business update. Technical view ""With an optimistic approach maintained, one can expect further targets of 25,500 and 25,700 levels to be achievable, with most of the frontline stocks well poised for further gains, which can help the index to gain further, with the 24,900 zone remaining as the major and crucial support for the index,"" Vaishali Parekh of Prabhudas Lilladher said. ""Sensex has been gradually showing signs of improvement in the bias with the sentiment easing out, and with consolidation witnessed in the range of near 20 DMA & 50 EMA zone, there is anticipation of further positive development in the coming days. The index would need to move past the important 20DMA zone of the 83,000 level to establish conviction and thereafter anticipate a further rise, having the 50 EMA level at 81,900 as the crucial and important support as of now,"" she added. Eternal, Dr Reddy's, Tata Consumer Products, Tata Motors, and Jio Financial Services were the top gainers on the Nifty. Laggards on the index included Trent, Shriram Finance, Tech Mahindra, Reliance Industries, and Hero MotoCorp.

Specialty steel maker Mukand's shares up over 10 percent after Rs 673 crore land sale,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/specialty-steel-maker-mukand-s-shares-up-over-10-percent-after-rs-673-crore-land-sale-13318746.html,"Super specialty steel manufacturer and Bajaj Group company Mukand announced the sale of 17.77 acres of land in Thane district near Mumbai for close to Rs 673 crore, sending the share price sharply higher by over 10 percent in early trade on July 24. The move is aimed to unlock value by the company, and Mukand has received an advance of Rs 110 crore for the land deal. In the past, Mukand has used proceeds from non-core asset sale to pare down debt. ""...the Company has executed an Agreement for Sale on July 23, 2025 for the sale of land parcels admeasuring approx. 17.77 acres together with 50% undivided right, title and interest in the access road admeasuring approximately 2.73 acres and for the grant of a perpetual non-exclusive right of way over a land parcel admeasuring 0.16 acres or thereabouts situated at Kalwe and Dighe, in Thane district for a consideration of not less than Rs 86,980 per sq. mt. aggregating to approx Rs 673 crore and has received an advance of Rs 110 crore from the purchaser,"" a company filing said. As of March 2025, Mukand's adjusted net debt stood at Rs 1,537.85 crore with a net debt to equity at 1.60x. Adjusted net debt is defined as total liabilities, comprising interest-bearing loans and borrowings less cash and cash equivalents and current investments. The management has been focusing cost optimization to deepen presence in the specialty steel domain, particularly catering to the evolving demands of automotive, engineering, and oil & gas sectors. During FY25, Mukand clocked revenue from operations of Rs .4,911.16 crore, a modest decline of 5.08% compared to a year ago, which the management said was due to challenging market environment. In a volatile global backdrop of Russia–Ukraine conflict, supply chain disruptions in Middle East, and subdued steel demand in Europe, Mukand reported a net profit of Rs 86.95 crore for FY25. ""FY2024–25 presented significant challenges for the steel industry, with global headwinds stemming from geo-political tensions, supply chain disruptions, and dampened demand in key international markets. On the domestic front, the industry faced intense pressure due to a surge in low-priced steel imports and reduced exports, which weighed heavily on market dynamics and pricing,"" the company recent said. These external pressures have challenged Mukand's priority of operational efficiency and technological advancement. During FY25, one of Mukund's division secured its very first order from USA, a significant milestone in its global journey. Mukand plans to invest further in downstream value-added products to strengthen position and is prioritizing special steel for niche applications in aerospace, defense, power, and precision engineering. Over the last one year, Mukand's shares have fallen 11 percent, and are up 13 percent on a YTD basis. The steel maker has a market capitalisation of around Rs 2,100 crore."

KFC-operator Sapphire Foods shares also fell nearly 1 percent in morning trade, while Senores Pharma shares rallied over 12 percent. The companies had released their respective results on July 23. Bajaj Housing Finance Q1 Results: Bajaj Housing Finance on July 23 reported a net profit of Rs 583 crore for Q1 FY26. This marks a 21 percent on-year rise from the Rs 483 crore net profit reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year. However, the net profit fell marginally on a sequential basis from the Rs 587 crore reported in the previous quarter (Q4 FY25). The firm's revenue from operations rose 18 percent on-year and over 4 percent sequentially to Rs 2,616 crore during the quarter under review. Motilal Oswal Financial Services noted that the company's management has cut its FY26 AUM guidance to 21-23 percent, due to heightened competitive intensity on the acquisition of new loans, increased portfolio attrition, coupled with moderation in real estate demand. The company's management also said that net interest margin will decline by 15-20 bps in FY26 due to a reduction in investment income (which in FY25 was higher due to two rounds of capital raises) and lower income on derecognized loans due to the lower quantum of assignments planned in FY26, the domestic brokerage said. The shares of the company were down nearly 1 percent to trade at Rs 121 apiece. The stock has gained over 11 percent in the past six months, but is down nearly 5 percent in 2025 so far. It fell around 27 percent in the past one year. Sapphire Foods Q1 Results: KFC and Pizza Hut-operator Sapphire Foods reported a net loss of Rs 1.8 crore in Q1 FY26. This marks a significant decline from the Rs 8.5 crore net profit reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year. The firm's revenue from operations meanwhile rose 8 percent on year to Rs 777 crore. In Q1 FY26, Sapphire Foods added 8 KFC restaurants and 2 Pizza Hut outlets in India, and 1 Pizza Hut in Sri Lanka. Sapphire Foods total restaurant count stood at 974 at the end of the quarter. EBITDA declined nearly 9 percent on-year to Rs 113.4 crore, and EBITDA margin fell to 14.6 percent. JM Financial kept a 'Buy' call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 360 apiece. This implies an upside potential of nearly 5 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. ""Sapphire's revenue growth was tepid at 8% YoY (4% miss) led by 11%/19% growth (4%/10% miss) in KFC/Sri Lanka businesses, while Pizza Hut (PH) business registered decline of 6% YoY (10% miss). SSSG for KFC was flat YoY with low single digit positive SSTG after several quarters led by higher value offerings ... Demand recovery holds the key for the management’s initiatives to bear fruit; we believe we are now near the bottom of the earning cuts cycle and could witness a sharp uptick in margin and profitability once the demand environment improves,"" the brokerage said. Motilal Oswal also maintained a 'Buy' rating on the stock, with a target price of Rs 400 apiece, implying an upside potential of nearly 16 percent from the current levels. ""The company continues to face challenges in unit economics, with dine-in seeing more pressure than delivery. To drive recovery, the focus remains on product innovation, enhancing customer engagement, and strengthening value-led offerings. However, improvement in ADS and SSSG will be key monitorables, as they are essential for restoring unit-level profitability. The store expansion spree is expected to slow down in FY26 (mainly in PH) to fix profitability metrics,"" the domestic brokerage said. Sapphire Foods shares dropped nearly 1 percent to trade at Rs 341 apiece. The stock has dropped nearly 7 percent in the past five days, but gained nearly 5 percent in the past one month. The shares of the company have gained nearly 12 percent in the past six months. Senores Pharma Q1 Results: Senores Pharma reported a net profit of Rs 19.73 crore for the first quarter of the financial year 2026. This marks a whopping 84 percent on-year surge from the Rs 10.73 crore net profit reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year.

The performance also sharply contrasted with Persistent Systems and LTIMindtree, which reported CC growth of 3.3 percent and 0.8 percent, respectively.

This came despite Asian markets rallying for a sixth straight session and Wall Street inching higher on hopes of further US-led trade agreements after its recent pact with Japan. IT stocks edged dragged in the opening trade and the broader markets also mirrored weak trends. At about 9:30 am, the Sensex was down 170.55 points or 0.21 percent at 82,556.09, and the Nifty was down 30.65 points or 0.12 percent at 25,189.25.

Ongoing developments in global trade negotiations are expected to ease near-term trade tensions and support market stability. While high valuations remain a concern, current market strength suggests room for a near-term earnings rebound. That said, the pace and sustainability of this recovery will be key to determining the market’s direction going forward, Vinod Nair of Geojit Investments said. Markets opened mixed on Thursday, July 24, with sectoral indices showing a scattered trend. Nifty Pharma led the gains, rising 0.65 percent, followed by Nifty Metal and Nifty Auto, up 0.61 percent and 0.30 percent, respectively. On the other hand, Nifty IT was the biggest drag, slipping 1.15 percent. Banking stocks were under pressure, with Nifty Bank and Nifty Private Bank down 0.28 percent and 0.39 percent, respectively. The broader indices also traded weak, with the Nifty Midcap 100 down 0.33 percent and the Nifty Smallcap 100 lower by 0.14 percent.

This marks a 15 percent on-year jump from the Rs 290 crore net profit reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year. Nomura and Morgan Stanley remain bullish on the stock. Technical view Yesterday's close underscores the importance of the 24,900–25,000 support zone in shaping the next directional move. The area between 25,200–25,320 has consistently acted as a stiff resistance cluster throughout the month, with the index now hovering near a key swing high. However, as long as the index maintains levels above 24,800, the probability of buying interest emerging on dips remains favorable. A decisive close above 25,250 would be instrumental in negating the existing bearish undertone and reviving broader bullish sentiment. Dr Reddy's, Tata Motors, Eternal, Tata Steel, and Tata Consumer Products were the top gainers on the Nifty. Laggards on the index included Trent, Hero MotoCorp, Kotak Mahindra Bank, UltraTech Cement, and Infosys.

The company’s revenue from operations meanwhile rose 10 percent on-year to Rs 4,778.91 crore during the quarter under review, compared to Rs 4,352 crore in the same period last year. TCPL posted an eight percent fall in consolidation EBITDA for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, while EBITDA margins shrunk over 250 basis points, dragged by coffee price corrections in the non-branded business. Tata Consumer Products expects its branded tea margins to bounce back by the December quarter, aided by falling auction prices and improved pass-through of cost inflation. Tea prices makes up a significant portion of Tata Consumer's revenue and had been surging since 2024 amid adverse weather conditions and supply snarls. The owner of Tata Tea, expects the prices to move downward, with Q2 being the transition period. Tea prices are currently down 13 per cent YOY according to the latest auction data. At 9.16 a.m., shares were quoting Rs 1,098.1, higher by 3.3 percent on the NSE. Should you buy, sell, or hold shares of TCPL? Japan-based brokerage Nomura has a 'buy' rating on Tata Consumer with a target price of Rs 1,300 per share. Q1 sales were in line, though EBITDA came in slightly below expectations. The company remains confident of achieving double-digit sales growth and a strong margin recovery in the second half, said the brokerage. Morgan Stanley maintained its 'overweight' tag with a target price of Rs 1,255 per share. Both revenue and EBITDA margin beat the brokerage's estimates. The brokerage expects margins to improve sequentially and return to normative levels. With moderating tea prices and improving product mix (higher sales of premium tea), consolidated margins are expected to expand from Q2FY26, led by better gross margins in the tea business, as indicated by management. The company has guided for consolidated EBITDA margin to gradually reach ~16 percent by Q3, noted Motilal Oswal. The brokerage kept its 'buy' call intact, with an increased price target of Rs 1,270 per share.

"Sensex, Nifty poised to extend gains amid positive global cues; key levels to track on July 24",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sensex-nifty-poised-to-extend-gains-amid-positive-global-cues-key-levels-to-track-on-july-24-13317728.html,"Benchmark indices Nifty and Sensex are set to open higher on July 24, lifted by optimism around a likely India-UK trade deal expected later in the day. The upbeat mood is further supported by strong global cues, with Asian markets extending their winning streak to a sixth session and Wall Street edging up on hopes of more US-led trade agreements following its pact with Japan. At about 7:40 am, the Gift Nifty was trading at 25,300, higher by 0.2 percent or 50 points. Dalal Street closed on a strong note Wednesday, buoyed by optimism around the U.S.-Japan trade deal and fresh cheer from the India-UK free trade pact. The agreement, which includes tariff cuts on British whisky, cars, and select food items, while granting duty-free access to Indian textiles and EVs, added to investor confidence and lifted benchmark indices. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Here are the key levels to watch out for in today's session Yesterday's close underscores the importance of the 24,900–25,000 support zone in shaping the next directional move. The area between 25,200–25,320 has consistently acted as a stiff resistance cluster throughout the month, with the index now hovering near a key swing high. However, as long as the index maintains levels above 24,800, the probability of buying interest emerging on dips remains favorable. A decisive close above 25,250 would be instrumental in negating the existing bearish undertone and reviving broader bullish sentiment. ""On the technical front, the Bank Nifty index continues to derive support from its 20-day exponential moving average (20-DEMA), currently positioned at 56,800. However, follow-through buying remains critical, and a close above 57,350 is required to confirm a directional breakout. The zone between 56,600 and 56,800, supported by significant put writing, stands as a strong demand base and represents the final line of defence for bulls,"" Dhupesh Dhameja of Samco Securities said. ""The area between 57,250–57,350 has emerged as a formidable resistance belt, coinciding with a swing high that has capped rallies throughout the month. That said, as long as the index remains above 56,800, the potential for fresh buying on dips continues to hold merit. A definitive close above 57,250 would help dispel the existing bearish shadow and could revive a positive market sentiment,"" he added. India VIX declined by 2.21 percent to close at 10.51, remaining well below the crucial 13 mark. The continued low-volatility environment points to a market that, while experiencing intraday bearish attempts, shows no signs of panic or aggressive long unwinding. This subdued volatility reinforces the ongoing consolidation narrative, rather than signaling any major correction or trend reversal. The Put-Call Ratio (PCR) surged from 0.86 to 1.08, indicating enhanced Put writing and a tilt in sentiment toward bullish positioning. The ongoing battle between call and put writers at key strike levels reflects the market's indecisiveness.

SEBI may allow IPO of big companies with less stake dilution,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sebi-may-allow-ipo-of-big-companies-with-less-stake-dilution-13313276.html,"The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is considering a proposal that could allow large companies to launch initial public offerings (IPOs) with a smaller issue size and hence lower stake dilution. This move is aimed at making it easier for well-established and cash-rich businesses to list on stock exchanges without being burdened by existing minimum public shareholding norms. Sebi is now considering reducing the initial dilution requirement for such large companies to 2.5 percent plus Rs 2500 crore. A source said, “This change could offer more flexibility to promoters and existing shareholders, especially when the company does not need to raise a large amount of capital through the IPO”. This development is part of Sebi’s ongoing efforts to improve the Ease of Doing Business and make the IPO process more flexible and practical, especially for large conglomerates and public sector undertakings (PSUs). According to second source familiar with the matter, “the idea has been discussed internally and may soon be released as a consultation paper for public feedback”. The same source said, the market regulator is also looking at tweaking the current market capitalisation slabs used to determine the minimum public offer size. As per the current norms, companies with post-IPO market capitalisation between Rs 4,000 crore and Rs 1,00,000 crore must meet specific offer size and dilution requirements. Sebi may revise the lower end of this range to Rs 50,000 crore. Currently, Sebi rules require companies to dilute a minimum percentage of their stake depending on their post-IPO market capitalisation. For companies valued at Rs 1,00,000 crore or more after the IPO, the mandatory dilution is 5 percent, along with a requirement to raise public shareholding to 10 percent within two years and 25 percent within five years of listing. One of the main concerns raised by industry stakeholders is that many large companies, especially those with strong balance sheets and sufficient cash reserves, do not require significant funding. However, they are still required to float large IPOs to meet the current minimum dilution rules. This can discourage some companies from going public or delay their listing plans. A second source said, “Public sector undertakings (PSUs) have also faced challenges under these rules, as they may not need fresh capital but are still expected to meet strict public shareholding norms”. He further said, “these constraints have prompted Sebi to review the existing framework and explore more practical options”. Another issue highlighted is the negative market reaction that often follows news of stake dilution. When investors learn that a company is required to offload a certain percentage of its stake to meet minimum public shareholding norms, it can lead to a drop in the company’s stock price—even when there is no change in its financial fundamentals. Also read: Finance Ministry backs equity status for REITs, InvITs; Decision likely in SEBI's next board meet An email seeking comments from Sebi did not elicit any response. Currently, under the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules, 1957, companies with a post-IPO market capitalisation of Rs 1,600 crore are required to dilute 25 percent of their stake. For companies in the Rs 1,600 crore to Rs 4,000 crore range, they must meet the 25 percent public shareholding requirement within three years of listing. Companies valued between Rs 4,000 crore and Rs 1,00,000 crore must dilute at least 10 percent at the time of IPO and also meet the 25 percent public shareholding within three years. The highest slab, for companies valued at Rs 1,00,000 crore and above, requires a 5 percent dilution plus Rs 5,000 crore at the time of listing, with further shareholding targets set for later years. These rules were last amended in June 2021. Sebi’s fresh look at the framework could open doors for more large companies to list smoothly and efficiently.

Click to View More Outlook for July 24 Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities Nifty has moved above the 21-day EMA on the daily timeframe, indicating an increase in bullish sentiment, supported by improved optimism following the trade deal between the US and Japan. The RSI on the daily chart is in a bullish crossover and rising above the 50 mark, further reinforcing the positive momentum. In the short term, sentiment is likely to remain optimistic. On the higher side, Nifty may move towards 25,500, while support is placed at 24,900. A break below this level could weaken the current trend. Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets traded with a positive bias and gained over half a percent, offering some relief after the recent decline. Following an initial uptick, the Nifty moved in a narrow range during the first half; however, strength in select heavyweights, particularly from the banking and financial sectors, propelled the index higher. As a result, it surpassed the short-term moving average (20 DEMA) and moved closer to the previous swing high zone near 25,250, eventually settling at the 25,219.90 level. On the sectoral front, the trend remained mixed, with auto, banking, and financials ending in the green, while realty and FMCG closed in the red. The broader market also reflected a mixed tone, as the midcap index gained nearly half a percent while the smallcap index ended almost flat. The ongoing recovery is being driven primarily by strength in banking majors, while heavyweights from other key sectors are showing signs of stabilization following the recent correction. However, the IT sector, which holds significant weight in the index, continues to face selling pressure and is gradually inching lower. Participants will closely watch Infosys’ results, as its performance will be crucial in determining the next leg of the move for the IT space. Amid these developments, we maintain our cautious stance and continue to recommend a hedged approach.

Neutral Havells India; target of Rs 1680: Motilal Oswal,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/neutral-havells-india-target-of-rs-1680-motilal-oswal-13313811.html,"Motilal Oswal's research report on Havells India Havells India’s (HAVL) 1QFY26 revenue declined ~6% YoY to INR54.6b (~7% miss), driven by lower-than-expected growth in the Lloyd/ECD/lighting segments. Its EBITDA declined ~10% YoY to INR5.2b (~8% miss) due to margin contraction across segments except cables and wires (C&W), which saw margin expansion. OPM stood at 9.5% (down 40bp YoY; 20bp below est.). PAT declined ~15% YoY to INR3.5b (11% miss). Management highlighted that 1QFY26 was a challenging quarter, largely due to an unexpected weak summer and continued muted consumer demand, which impacted cooling products revenue, further compounded by a high base in the previous year. However, the C&W segment remained a bright spot, delivering strong growth supported by healthy infrastructure and industrial demand. It believes that the current challenges are transitory and remains optimistic about achieving revenue growth and margin expansion in the upcoming quarters. Outlook We cut our EPS estimate by ~8%/7% each for FY26/FY27E as we cut revenue and margin estimates for the Lloyd/ECD/Lighting segments. We have introduced FY28 estimates in this note. HAVL’s valuations at 60x/48x FY26/27E EPS remain expensive. We reiterate our Neutral rating with a TP of INR1,680 (based on 50x Jun’27E EPS).

EBITDA/t surged ~22% YoY to INR1,226 (in line). Adj. PAT jumped ~75% YoY to INR3.2b (+19% vs. our estimate, fueled by lower depreciation and higher other income). Management highlighted that the Central and South regions propelled strong volume growth, while the North was weak. The average cement price was flat sequentially, as strong pricing in the South was offset by pressure in the Central and Northern regions. JKCE maintained its FY26 grey cement volume guidance of 20mt and aims to achieve cost savings of INR40–50/t. Capacity expansion is progressing on schedule, with Panna and Bihar projects (total clinker/grinding capacity of 4.0mtpa/6.0mtpa) expected to be commissioned by Dec’25. Outlook We broadly maintain our EBITDA estimates for FY26-28. We raise our EPS by ~6-7% for FY26/27E due to a lower depreciation estimate.

Reduce Mahindra Finance; target of Rs 260: Emkay Global Financial,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/reduce-mahindra-finance-target-of-rs-260-emkay-global-financial-13313257.html,"Emkay Global Financial' research report on Mahindra Finance Not surprisingly, MMFS posted muted results in Q1FY26, with PAT at ~Rs5.3bn largely hit by elevated credit cost (~25bps higher than our estimate of ~1.9% of business assets), and YoY AUM growth of 15%/disbursement growth of only 1%. Despite the management’s continual efforts and initiatives in recent years toward diversifying away from the wheels business, MMFS remained dominated by wheels (~90%). Except in tractors, disbursement was sluggish across other wheels products, thus hurting overall disbursement. This poses a challenge for near-term growth, as the new segments are still too small to drive AUM growth. Margins (NIM + Fees) in 1Q saw a minor improvement led by higher fee income, improved product yield, and Rs0.46bn dividend income (~14bps impact on NIM) from MIBL (will be recurring income going ahead); these are expected to improve, led by changing asset mix along with increasing cross-sells and fee income. The mgmt indicated it has been calibrating some less attractive segments on a risk adjusted basis; this would reduce inter-quarter volatility in terms of margin and credit cost. Overall, the mgmt remains constructive about above-average monsoon-led/improving rural cashflow-led demand recovery for driving AUM growth and better credit cost. Outlook However, we see growth and asset quality seeing challenges in the near term which would result in continued subpar profitability. We retain REDUCE on MMFS with unchanged Jun-26E TP of Rs260 (implying FY27E P/B of 1.3x).

We emphasise that ex treasury, PPoP declined nearly ~50% both YoY and QoQ. MFI slippages improved QoQ (along with SMA pool), though were offset by higher slippages in credit card and secured retail. We emphasise that NIM and RoA for RBL are much leveraged to the growth and asset quality of high-yielding credit card and MFI, where only gradual revival is likely.

Further, buoyant cement prices were instrumental in propelling its Q1FY26 EBITDA by an impressive 51% YoY (being 5% ahead of our estimate). And to boot, sector tailwinds (essentially, easing competitive intensity) are driving ~8% of upward revision to our EBITDA estimates for FY26/FY27 – with scope for further uptick, should cement prices stay firm in Q2FY26. Yet, we recommend caution on the stock given leverage concerns – amplified by Nuvoco’s recent acquisition of Vadraj Cement (Vadraj: cost of acquisition and refurbishment sums up to ~INR 36-37bn, which may keep debt elevated). While Nuvoco has guided to raise INR 12bn via the issuance of CCPS/CCDs, we view this as quasi-debt. Outlook With the acquisition’s benefits likely to accrue mainly in FY28 and our estimate of a subdued RoE (~5%) in the interim, we see little merit to argue in favour of a higher valuation multiple (of ~9x FY27E EV/EBITDA).

The key driver was sequential increase of over INR 3,300 (+6%) in NSR across Indian operations coupled with lower RM costs (coking coal cost fell by USD 14/te QoQ). The operating performance would have been even better had the company not suffered one-time loss of INR 3.4bn on FX MTM on Euro loans and INR 2bn shutdown-related costs (together one-time cost impact translated to INR 800/te contraction in EBITDA). Though Q2FY26 realisations are expected to moderate, higher volumes, lower RM costs (iron ore cost to be down by INR 1,000/te) and absence of one-time hit are expected to neutralise the effect to a large extent.

Buy Zee Entertainment; target of Rs 185: ICICI Securities,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/buy-zee-entertainment-target-of-rs-185-icici-securities-13312873.html,"ICICI Securities's research report on Zee Entertainment ZEEL’s advertising revenue declined 9.4% QoQ/16.8% YoY, impacted by the IPL and weak FMCG spending. However, management commentary suggests early signs of stabilisation, with potential recovery supported by festive tailwinds and improving rural demand. Gains in TV market share and early traction in Zee Anmol are key positives in linear TV. However, Pay TV subscription revenue declined ~9% YoY, due to pending negotiations with DTH operators on price increase. ZEE5 revenue grew 30% YoY, led by regional language subscription packs, while losses narrowed to INR 658mn. We expect losses to reduce further with operating leverage.

Volumes at its minor ports, Jaigarh and Dharamtar, were flat due to weakness in third-party cargo and a shutdown at Dolvi steel plant. We expect a higher volume growth in H2 aided by the full commissioning of LPG terminal at JNPT and an improvement in iron ore and coal cargo for its group steel company. JSWIL is expanding its minor ports by 30% to meet the cargo requirements for its group’s expansion. It has also won new terminals at major ports which are under construction.

Despite NIM headwinds (down 18bps QoQ), SIB sustained ~1% RoA for the eighth consecutive quarter, aided by strong other income. The bank has prudently utilised its bumper treasury gains (~75bps of assets) towards shoring up PCR (up ~700bps to 79%) and paring net NPA (to 68bps), which enhances the visibility towards healthy profitability ahead. We believe an acceleration in core MSME growth is critical for NIM/RoA progression and the stock’s re-rating.

Contribution margin increased by 400bps QoQ to 60%, on considerably lower DLG costs as Paytm’s largest lending partner is making disbursements under the non-DLG model as against the DLG model in previous quarters. We believe lenders’ willingness to offer loans without DLG is a testimony to the improved asset quality of the merchant loan portfolio. Paytm is executing well on acquiring merchants, leveraging its superior Soundbox products and distributing loans to them. With low penetration of loans, we see a long growth runway for this business. The stock trades at 29x FY28E EV/EBITDA.

The management maintained its FY26/27 smartphone volume guidance of ~40- 45/60-65mn units; it also retained its outlook of 120-150bps margin expansion by FY27 in the mobiles segment (implying 70-80bps overall) led by strategic backward integration – a) JV with HKC for display module, b) Q-Tech acquisition for camera modules (consolidation from Q3; revenue likely to grow to Rs50bn in 5Y from Rs19bn in FY25), and c) JV with Chongqing for precision components. Though mobile PLI is set to expire in FY26 (0.6% EBITDAM impact), Dixon would continue enjoying strong competitive advantage on i) scale-led operating leverage, ii) deepening customer relations, iii) benefits from backward integration. The mgmt highlighted that while PCB is not lucrative (on lack of duty arbitrage), PCBA for industrials, automotive application, etc could be a major driver for Dixon’s next phase of growth.

Management assuaged concerns regarding the US and AMEA highlighting the strong US order book (~25% q/q & y/y growth) coupled with appointment of an AMEA head, a seasoned Cerner healthcare alum, who will drive growth combining Mastek's’ traditional Oracle ability with Cerner experience.

Hold Colgate Palmolive; target of Rs 2453: Prabhudas Lilladher,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/hold-colgate-palmolive-target-of-rs-2453-prabhudas-lilladher-13312128.html,"Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Colgate Palmolive We cut FY26/27 EPS by 7.1/7.4% given subdued urban demand, competitive pressures and little scope to increase margins from current elevated levels. CLGT 1Q26 was a miss on estimates with 4.4% revenue decline led by 2.8% volume decline (high base, subdued urban demand and intensifying competitive pressures). Near term outlook remains cautious as impact of high base, tepid urban demand, heightened competition and promotions/ discounting will continue to impact in at least 2Q also. We expect slow growth in the near term as the phase of high realization and margin growth is behind (GM and EM expansion of 470/680bps over FY20-25). Although CLGT’s long term drivers are intact led by 1) driving core toothpaste brands and 2) premiumization through science-backed innovations (driving growth in urban premium segments), however, any major acceleration in growth looks unlikely. We expect volume growth to settle at low to mid-single digits with 7-8% sustainable PAT growth in the long term. Outlook We estimate 2.6% EPS CAGR over FY25-27. We value CLGT at 44x March 27 EPS and assign a target of Rs2453 (Rs2528 earlier). Retain Hold.

"SBI Life Q1 Preview: Modest APE growth seen, margin gains to drive VNB",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/sbi-life-q1-preview-modest-ape-growth-seen-margin-gains-to-drive-vnb-13311709.html,"SBI Life is expected to deliver modest growth in its annual premium equivalent (APE) for the April–June quarter, while robust margins are likely to underpin healthy growth in value of new business (VNB), analysts said ahead of the life insurer’s results scheduled for July 24, 2025. According to Moneycontrol's poll, SBI Life is projected to report an 8.2 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise in APE — an insurance industry metric that represents the annualised value of new policies sold — climbing to Rs 3,941 crore from Rs 3,640 crore in the same quarter last year. Meanwhile, the company’s VNB — which indicates the profitability of the new business written — is expected to grow by around 14 percent YoY, reaching approximately Rs 1,103 crore in Q1FY26 compared to Rs 970 crore in Q1FY25. Estimates of analysts polled by Moneycontrol are shown to be in a narrow range, meaning any positive or negative surprises may elicit a sharp reaction in the stock price. Among the brokerages polled, Axis Securities rolled out the most bullish projections while Kotak Institutional Equities forecasted the slowest growth for SBI Life. What factors are driving the earnings? Margin expansion: Brokerages expect SBI Life's VNB margins to sharply expand to 28 percent in Q1FY26 from 27 percent in the year-ago period due to shift in product mix towards non-par and protection segments. However, investments in distribution are likely to partially offset the positive impact. Modest APE growth: APE growth is expected to remain modest in single digits during the quarter, owing to a relative slowdown in the unit-linked insurance plan (ULIP) segment as well as the high base effect of Q1FY25. Gross premium growth: The company’s gross premium income is forecast to rise between 13–14 percent YoY in the June quarter, which should also support the overall financial performance. What to look out for in the quarterly show? Investors and analysts will closely track the company’s outlook for growth in the banca channel, particularly its business through State Bank of India branches. Comments from management on the trajectory of VNB margins, as well as any updates on changes in the product mix and strategy, will also be keenly watched.

MAHLOG IN reported an in-line operating performance with an EBITDA margin of 4.7% (PLe 4.9%).

"Supreme Court upholds Delhi HC's relief to SpiceJet over Kalanithi Maran's Rs 1,300 crore claim against the airline",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/supreme-court-upholds-delhi-hc-s-relief-to-spicejet-over-kalanithi-maran-s-rs-1-300-crore-claim-against-the-airline-13311807.html,"In a relief for SpiceJet that sent shares sharply higher by over 3 percent on July 23, the Supreme Court has upheld a Delhi High Court order rejecting Rs 1,300 crore claim against the airline in a plea by Maran-owned KAL Airways. Granting relief to the airline, a bench of Justices Pamidighantam Sri Narasimha and Atul S Chandurkar said, ""Both the special leave petitions are dismissed."" Maran-owned KAL Airways had moved apex court seeking to challenge Delhi High Court’s order that had dismissed claim for damages against SpiceJet over a share transfer dispute. ""These claims were thoroughly examined and subsequently rejected by a panel of three retired Supreme Court judges. Following this, KAL Airways and Kalanithi Maran appealed to the single judge bench of the Delhi High Court, seeking the same amount in damages, which was also rejected by the court,"" the airline had said in May. SpiceJet has been facing financial challenges and aircraft grounding, which has impacted its market share. The airline has also been involved in disputes with other entities, including Credit Suisse, for which it has been ordered to make payments. Reporting on the hearing, legal news publication Bar and Bench said the Court found appellants’ conduct lacking in bona fides and deliberately misleading. The delay in appeal by Maran and KAL Airways was not due to negligence or oversight, but a litigation strategy. Case History The legal dispute dates back to 2015 when Maran, along with KAL Airways had transferred their 58.46% controlling stake in SpiceJet to the airline's original founder, Ajay Singh. The transaction took place at a time of a financial crisis that had grounded the airline for several months, with Singh taking on liabilities. Maran and KAL Airways claimed they paid for convertible warrants and preference shares, which they allege were never issued, leading to an arbitration and later the case reaching the Delhi High Court in 2017. An arbitral tribunal had initially ruled in favour of KAL Airways but the award was set aside by Delhi High Court and later Supreme Court in 2024. Revival Plans As of March 2025, SpiceJet's networth stood at Rs 683 crore and the promoter group had completed an equity infusion of Rs 500 crore, including the final tranche of Rs 294.09 crore in the March quarter. The airline has partnered with StandardAero and Carlyle Aviation to fast-track engine overhaul and fleet restoration. As part of its summer schedule, the airline had launched 24 new domestic flights and added three new destinations - Tuticorin, Porbandar and Dehradun. By the end of 2025, the airline has targetted a fleet size of 52 aircraft, mostly on wet or dry lease contracts."

This comes despite the company reporting a net profit of Rs 123 crore for the first quarter of the financial year 2026, as against a net loss of Rs 839 crore a year ago. This was the first operationally-driven quarterly net profit reported by the firm since listing. It also reported a positive EBITDA of Rs 72 crore in Q1 FY26, as against an EBITDA loss in both Q4 FY25 and Q1 FY25. Its revenue from operations meanwhile surged 28 percent on-year to Rs 1,917.5 crore. Paytm said that the rise in its operating revenue came on the back of increase in number of subscription merchants, higher GMV and growth in revenues from distribution of financial services. ""EBITDA and PAT turned profitable at ₹72 Cr (margin of 4%) and ₹123 Cr respectively, demonstrating AI-led operating leverage, disciplined cost structure and higher other income,"" the firm said. Should you buy, sell or hold? Jefferies upgraded its rating of Paytm shares to 'Buy', and raised its target price for the stock to Rs 1,250 per share. This implies an upside potential of nearly 19 percent from the previous closing price of Rs 1,051 per share. The international brokerage said that the firm's Q1 EBITDA was ahead of its estimates due to lower DLG cost and operational leverage. It expects the firm to see continued profit growth from rise in revenue and operating leverage. According to Jefferies, Paytm's valuation is still at a discount to that of Policybazaar-parent PB Fintech, hence there is scope for compounding returns. Citi kept a 'Buy' call on Paytm, and hiked its target price for the stock to Rs 1,215 per share. This implies an upside potential of nearly 16 percent from the previous closing price. The brokerage said that the firm's Q1 results were driven by cost efficiencies and non-DLG profit contribution. Merchant business is performing well, and consumer business recovery is underway, it added. Bernstein kept an 'Outperform' rating on Paytm shares, with a target price of Rs 1,100 per share. This implies an upside potential of nearly 5 percent over the stock’s previous closing price. The international brokerage noted that the firm's net profit was achieved without one-offs, driven by ESOP cost reduction and marketing strategies. It noted that future profitability is dependent on sequential revenue growth. The shares of the company were down 1.9 percent to trade at Rs 1,031 apiece, as seen as 9.45 am.

Nomura downgraded the stock to a 'Reduce' rating with a target price of Rs 2,350 per share. It said Q1 results missed expectations, with volumes falling 3–4 percent year-on-year and EBITDA declining 11 percent. The weakness was attributed to subdued demand and a high base. While new product launches are aiding premiumisation, Nomura flagged continued margin pressure due to higher promotions and negative operating leverage. HSBC retained a 'Hold' rating while trimming its target price to Rs 2,600 per share, noting that Q1FY26 performance was even weaker than expected despite earlier guidance for a soft H1FY26. The brokerage said EBITDA margins declined even as the company controlled advertising and promotion (A&P) spends.

Citi echoed a bearish stance, retaining a 'Sell' rating and reducing its target price to Rs 2,175 from Rs 2,300. The brokerage pointed to weak revenue and EBITDA performance, citing soft urban demand, increased competitive intensity, and a high base.

Offering a more optimistic outlook, Nuvama maintained a 'Buy' rating with a target price of Rs 3,135. It acknowledged the Q1 softness in revenue and EBITDA, which it attributed to muted urban demand and a high base, noting that toothpaste volumes declined 2 percent year-on-year against an 8–9 percent base. Margins were impacted by heavy promotional activity and weak operating leverage, but the firm expects a recovery in H2FY26.

"Dixon Tech shares gain 3% after strong Q1; should you buy, sell or hold?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/dixon-tech-shares-gain-3-after-strong-q1-should-you-buy-sell-or-hold-13310865.html,"Shares of Dixon Technologies rallied as much as 3 percent to Rs 16,540 on July 23 after the company reported its first quarter earnings. A slew of brokerages have dished out bullish calls on the stock, while Morgan Stanley remains underweight, citing a broad-based Q1 miss. The EMS major on July 22 reported a net profit of Rs 225 crore for the first quarter of the financial year 2026. This marks a 68 percent on-year jump from the Rs 134 crore net profit reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates The leading EMS player's revenue from operations meanwhile soared 95 percent on-year to Rs 12,836 crore in Q1 FY26. The company had earlier reported a revenue of Rs 6,579.8 crore for Q1 FY25. EBITDA grew 89 percent on-year to Rs 484 crore, while EBITDA margin rose to 3.8 percent during the quarter under review. Dixon Tech's mobile and other EMS segment saw a 125 percent on-year rise in revenue to Rs 11,663 crore. Operating profit for the segment meanwhile surged 131 percent on-year to Rs 395 crore. Also read: Mutual funds cut stakes in private banks for second month, managers call it a “tactical shift” Nomura has maintained a 'Buy' rating on Dixon Technologies with a target price of Rs 21,154 per share. This implies an upside potential of 31 percent from the last close. The brokerage said execution remains on track across both mobile and component segments. Dixon's Q1 earnings came in ahead of estimates, and the ramp-up in mobile production is expected to continue. Nomura also expects margin tailwinds from the scale-up of multiple joint ventures, projecting EBITDA margins to rise from 3.9 percent in FY26 to between 4.4–4.7 percent in FY27–28. CLSA has a high-conviction 'Outperform' call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 19,365 per share. It noted that Q1 results beat expectations and reiterated the company's FY26 smartphone production guidance of 41–43 million units, up from 28 million in FY25. CLSA believes future growth will be driven by the Vivo joint venture, exports, and other segments. Margin expansion is also expected as component manufacturing scales up, even after the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) benefits taper off in FY27.

Auto, IT and oil & gas stocks opened higher, while the broader markets were flat. At about 9:30 am, the Sensex was up 264.92 points or 0.32 percent at 82,451.73, and the Nifty was up 81.00 points or 0.32 percent at 25,141.90. About 1507 shares advanced, 883 shares declined, and 123 shares remained unchanged. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates ""The 11th new record high for 2025 set by S&P 500 yesterday is an indication of the direction and resilience of equity markets globally. Markets are climbing all walls of worries, and valuation concerns have been put on the back burner. In the near term this resilience is likely to continue,"" V KVijaykumar, Chief Strategist at Geojit Investments Limited, said. Experts also add that upside in Q1 earnings will be the critical point to sustain the current premium valuations. Continued profit booking by the FIIs exerts downward pressure, while steady inflows from DIIs could support a range-bound movement with a positive bias towards Q1 results and the trade deal. Among stocks, Dixon Tech shares rallied 2 percent after the company reported its first quarter earnings. A slew of brokerages have dished out bullish calls on the stock, while Morgan Stanley remains underweight, citing a broad-based Q1 miss. The EMS major on July 22 reported a net profit of Rs 225 crore for the first quarter of the financial year 2026. This marks a 68 percent on-year jump from the Rs 134 crore net profit reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year. One 97 Communications Ltd, the parent of Paytm, surged over 3 percent after it reported consolidated net profit of Rs 123 crore in the quarter ended June 30, 2025 as against net loss of Rs 839 crore a year ago, aided by strong lending business and as it kept a tight lid on expenses, especially marketing and employee cost. Jefferies, Citi Research, and Bernstein gave bullish calls. Colgate Palmolive (India) slipped 2 percent after the company reported an 11.8 percent year-on-year decline in net profit to Rs 321 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2025. Revenue from operations also fell 4.3 percent to Rs 1,433 crore, while total income declined to Rs 1,433 crore from Rs 1,496.71 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. As long as the index holds above 24,800, scope for supportive buying on dips remains intact. A decisive close above 25,250 is essential to negate the prevailing bearish undertone and revive bullish sentiment. Relative Strength Index (RSI) continues to hover below the neutral 50 mark, confirming the lack of positive momentum and reinforcing the current cautious market tone. Until a directional breakout occurs on either side, the index is likely to remain trapped in a low-volatility, range-bound environment. Tata Motors, Jio Financial Services, Maruti Suzuki, L&T, and Coal India were the top gainers on the Nifty. Laggards on the index included Titan Company, Tata Consumer Products, SBI Life Insurance, HDFC Bank, and SBI.

Here are the key levels to watch out for in today's session As long as the index holds above 24,800, scope for supportive buying on dips remains intact. A decisive close above 25,250 is essential to negate the prevailing bearish undertone and revive bullish sentiment.

Until a directional breakout occurs on either side, the index is likely to remain trapped in a low-volatility, range-bound environment. ""The Nifty Bank index has established a strong foothold near the 0.50 percent Fibonacci retracement level, currently placed at 56,400, which serves as a crucial support and last line of defence for the bulls. This reinforces the significance of the 56,500–56,400 area in determining the next directional leg for the index,"" Dhupesh Dhameja of SAMCO Securities said. ""Despite multiple attempts, the index has been struggling to clear its swing resistance zone, which remains heavy near the 57,300 mark, highlighting sustained supply pressure from higher levels. The structure remains broadly neutral-to-weak, and as long as the index holds above 56,400, buyers may attempt to defend key support. However, a decisive breakout above 57,350 is essential to negate the bearish bias and reignite upward momentum,"" he added. The Put-Call Ratio (PCR) slipped from 0.86 to 0.70, indicating a pickup in call writing and suggesting a tilt towards bearish positioning. The tug-of-war between call and put writers near key strikes underlines the ongoing uncertainty in the market India VIX dropped sharply by 4.02 percent, closing at 10.75, remaining well below the crucial 13-mark. This persistently low volatility environment indicates that while bears are active during intraday pullbacks, there is no sign of panic or aggressive unwinding. The overall price action continues to reflect a disciplined consolidation phase, rather than a deep correction or trend reversal.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade HDFC Life Insurance, Hindalco, M&M, Swiggy, Nykaa, Indian Oil Corporation and others on July 23?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-hdfc-life-insurance-hindalco-m-m-swiggy-nykaa-indian-oil-corporation-and-others-on-july-23-13310014.html,"The benchmark indices fell by one-tenth of a percent on July 22, following a day of half a percent gains. The market breadth was dominated by bears, with 1,548 shares declining compared to 1,105 advancing shares on the NSE. The consolidation phase is likely to continue until the index shows a strong and sustainable close above short-term moving averages. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Amol Athawale, VP Technical Research at Kotak Securities HDFC Life Insurance Company | CMP: Rs 763.3 After a decline from higher levels, HDFC Life has rebounded from its support zone on the daily charts. Additionally, a sloping trendline breakout has occurred, accompanied by decent volume activity. The stock is witnessing a steady recovery from lower levels, suggesting the onset of a new bullish trend in the near term. As long as the stock trades above Rs 735, the bullish outlook is likely to continue. If it surpasses this level, the stock could move up to Rs 815. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 815 Stop-Loss: Rs 735 Hindalco Industries | CMP: Rs 690 On the daily chart, Hindalco is forming a rising channel with a higher highs and higher lows pattern. The stock has shown a steady recovery from trendline support levels. Moreover, the RSI indicates potential for further upside momentum, which could fuel a bullish trend in the near future. For positional traders, Rs 665 is a decisive level. If the stock trades above this level, the uptrend is likely to continue, targeting Rs 740. However, if it closes below Rs 665, traders may prefer to exit long positions. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 740 Stop-Loss: Rs 665 Indian Oil Corporation | CMP: Rs 152 After a gradual decline from higher levels, the downward momentum in Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has halted. On the daily charts, the stock has reversed from its short-term moving average and found support, with decent volume activity. This formation suggests a revival of the uptrend from the current levels. For the next few trading sessions, Rs 145 will be the key trend-deciding level for the bulls. If it sustains above this level, an uptrend toward Rs 163 is likely. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 163 Stop-Loss: Rs 145 Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors Mahindra and Mahindra | CMP: Rs 3,257.2 Despite the Auto sector closing in the red, Mahindra & Mahindra managed to reach a fresh high of Rs 3,271.90, indicating strength in the stock. Since July 14, the stock has held above its prior day's low on a closing basis and has gained nearly 7%, suggesting a bullish bias. Additionally, the MACD recently gave a bullish crossover, reinforcing a positive outlook for the stock. For the momentum to remain positive, the stock needs to sustain above its fresh high of Rs 3,272, which would further boost bullish momentum. Hence, the current trend for Mahindra & Mahindra remains in favour of the bulls. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,375, Rs 3,500 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,160 Swiggy | CMP: Rs 417.15 In the previous session, Swiggy surged over 5% with a rise in volumes, breaking out of a Cup and Handle pattern, with prices closing above the neckline near Rs 412. This pattern has been forming since February 2025. According to the three candlestick rules, the daily trend has shifted to the positive side. Additionally, Bollinger Bands are expanding, signaling that strong momentum may be seen in the upcoming sessions. However, given the sharp rise over the past two days, the RSI is nearing overbought territory on the shorter time frame. Therefore, buying on dips appears to be a prudent strategy to capitalize on the ongoing trend. A dip toward Rs 410-415 could present a good buying opportunity. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 430, Rs 445 Stop-Loss: Rs 394 FSN E-Commerce Ventures | CMP: Rs 220 Nykaa has been trading in a higher highs and higher lows structure within its upward-sloping channel since March 2025. At the beginning of July 2025, the stock found support at the channel and saw an 11% rise in a short span of time, signaling a strong bullish trend. Currently, the stock is trading near its previous swing high of Rs 220.40. A decisive break above this level is necessary for upward momentum to continue. If this occurs, the stock is expected to move toward the channel's resistance, near Rs 240. Additionally, the ADX shows readings of 30, suggesting that good positive momentum is likely to persist in the stock. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 230, Rs 240 Stop-Loss: Rs 210 Vinay Rajani, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities ICICI Prudential Nifty FMCG ETF | CMP: Rs 59.77 The FMCG sector appears to have bottomed out, with many large-cap FMCG stocks turning bullish on short-term charts. FMCG has underperformed the Nifty this calendar year, but a mean reversion and outperformance from the FMCG sector are expected going forward. We recommend going long on ICICI Prudential Nifty FMCG ETF to capitalize on our bullish view of the FMCG sector. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 63 Stop-Loss: Rs 57.50 ICICI Prudential Nifty India Consumption ETF | CMP: Rs 121.66 The NSE Consumption Index has been in a bullish trend, with higher tops and higher bottoms. Several consumption stocks in sectors like telecom, FMCG, and auto form the majority of the weight in this index. The index is currently above all key moving averages. We recommend going long in the ICICI Prudential Nifty India Consumption ETF to capitalize on our bullish view of the consumption sector. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 127 Stop-Loss: Rs 115 Nippon India ETF Hang Seng Bees | CMP: Rs 425.63 The Hang Seng, Hong Kong's equity market benchmark, has been forming higher tops and higher bottoms on the daily chart. The index has surpassed the crucial resistance of the previous swing high at 24,875. It is one of the best-performing indices globally year-to-date, and this trend is expected to continue. We recommend going long in the Nippon India ETF Hang Seng Bees to capitalize on our bullish view of the Hang Seng Index.

"Understanding risk is as important as returns, stresses SEBI's Ananth Narayan G",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/understanding-risk-is-as-important-as-returns-stresses-sebi-s-ananth-narayan-g-13309578.html,"With a growing number of investors entering India’s capital markets, SEBI's whole-time member Ananth Narayan G has stressed the importance of understanding market risks and volatility. Speaking at the International Conference on Financial Planning in New Delhi, Narayan emphasized that market movements are inevitable and that investment portfolios should be aligned with each investor’s individual risk appetite. He pointed out that while many investors have joined the market in recent years and become familiar with the concept of returns, there is still a need to better internalise the meaning of volatility and risk. According to Narayan, the number of unique investors in the market has grown from 4.2 crore in March 2020 to 13 crore as of today. Between April 2019 and June 2025, domestic investors brought in over Rs 18 lakh crore—approximately $210 billion—into risk-seeking, equity-oriented mutual fund schemes. This amount, he noted, is more than seven times the net inflows of $29 billion from foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) into the Indian equity markets during the same period. Narayan also highlighted the importance of trust and governance in the market ecosystem. He warned that trust can be undermined by incidents of serious governance failures or market manipulation. In this context, he said that first-line regulators—such as exchanges and depositories—along with Sebi and other stakeholders, have a crucial role to play. Citing a well-known saying, he remarked that ""if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is too good to be truthful"". He emphasized that investors should approach the market with a healthy level of scepticism and take responsibility for their investment decisions. Diversification across asset classes was another key point raised in his speech. He stated that sound financial planning requires diversification and noted a tendency among some small investors to heavily concentrate their investments in equities. To address this, Sebi is working to further strengthen the debt and commodities markets, providing investors with more robust alternatives. Narayan also drew attention to rising cyber risks and digital frauds, which are becoming more prominent with increasing digitization. He urged investors to be vigilant and take precautions, as fraudsters—often highly organized and sophisticated—target unsuspecting individuals. In addition, he shared details of SEBI’s initiative to conduct a household survey aimed at understanding how more investors can be brought into the market and how aware they are of associated risks.

"Q1 impact: Deepinder Goyal's net worth surges by Rs 1,700 crore as Eternal shares rise 20% in two days",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/q1-impact-deepinder-goyal-s-net-worth-surges-by-rs-1-700-crore-as-eternal-shares-rise-20-in-two-days-13308418.html,"Eternal, the parent company of Zomato and Blinkit, saw its shares surge nearly 15 percent to hit a record high of Rs 311.25 on the NSE on July 22, extending a two-day rally that lifted the stock by more than 20 percent. The sharp uptick, following a strong June quarter earnings report, added around Rs 40,000 crore to the company’s market capitalisation over the two sessions. Deepinder Goyal Net Worth Surges This rally translated into a significant wealth gain for Eternal CEO Deepinder Goyal, who holds 36,94,71,500 shares in the company. At the time of the earnings announcement, the stock stood at Rs 266. With the stock touching a high of Rs 311 in today's session, Goyal's wealth likely rose by over Rs 1,667 crore. Eternal shares settled at Rs 299.75 on the NSE, up 10.32 percent for the day. At this price, the value of Goyal’s stake stood at Rs 11,071.86 crore, as of July 22. With the recent rise in the stock, Eternal’s market capitalisation crossed the Rs 3 lakh crore mark, placing it ahead of over 20 Nifty 50 constituents, including Wipro, Tata Motors, JSW Steel, Nestle India, Coal India, Bajaj Auto, Asian Paints, Eicher Motors, Tech Mahindra and Cipla. The stock rally was supported by strong trading volumes, with nearly 27 crore shares changing hands on the NSE, generating a turnover of Rs 7,988.26 crore. The delivery volume was higher than the five-day average. The stock is trading above its 5 to 20 day moving averages. ""Eternal once again surprised us positively on Blinkit. This time though, the surprise was more on management commentary than the reported numbers, as it was quite a contrast to the cautious tone post 4QFY25 results,"" JM Financial Institutional Securities said in a note. In the quarter ended June, Eternal reported revenue from operations of Rs 7,167 crore, up from Rs 4,206 crore in the same period last year. For the first time, the net order value (NOV) of the company’s quick commerce business exceeded that of food delivery for the full quarter. Blinkit, which delivers everything from daily essentials to electronics in under 10 minutes, continues to lead the quick commerce space despite rising competition from BigBasket, Flipkart, Swiggy and Amazon. ""We overestimated the competitive threat,"" analysts at Jefferies said, citing Blinkit’s growth, improving margins, and higher growth expectations going ahead. Eternal posted a consolidated net profit of Rs 25 crore for the June quarter. This was sharply lower than the Rs 253 crore reported in the same quarter last year, as investments in quick commerce and going-out verticals impacted profitability. The company, which rebranded itself as Eternal in March, said the results are not comparable with the previous year’s quarter due to the acquisition of Orbgen Technologies Pvt Ltd and Wasteland Entertainment Pvt Ltd from One 97 Communications in August 2024. These firms operate the movie ticketing and events businesses, respectively.

After an initial uptick, the Nifty gradually drifted lower in the first half, followed by a sideways move until the close. Most key sectors ended in the red, with pharma, realty, and auto emerging as the top losers. The broader indices also mirrored the trend, shedding nearly half a percent each. The market continues to lack clear direction amid mixed earnings announcements and muted global cues. We maintain a cautious stance until the Nifty decisively reclaims the 25,250 mark, while immediate support is seen at 24,900. Meanwhile, traders should adopt a hedged approach and focus on fundamentally strong counters, with an emphasis on earnings performance. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The Nifty has remained mostly range-bound, facing resistance at the 21-EMA during the initial trades. On the hourly chart, the index failed to move above the 50-EMA. Overall, consolidation may continue in the coming days, as the index is not showing any signs of a breakout from the current trading zone. On the lower end, 24,900 continues to act as strong support, while resistance is placed at 25,260 — a breakout above which could lead to increased strength in the market.

"Rare earth PSU stocks rally: GMDC, NLC India shares surge up to 6%",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/rare-earth-stocks-rally-gmdc-nlc-india-shares-surge-up-to-6-13308053.html,"The shares of Gujarat Mineral Development Corporation (GMDC) and NLC India significantly surged on July 22. This came as rare earth stocks saw significant interest from investors. Latest data from China shows that the country boosted shipments of rare earth magnets in June, after a global supply squeeze that threatened factory closures and heightened trade tensions. Total export of the magnets rose to 3,188 tons last month, more than double of the 1,238 tons exported in May in the midst of China's curbs. GMDC shares gained around 6 percent to trade at Rs 462 apiece, extending gains for the fourth consecutive session. Earlier, during the day, the stock rallied further to hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs 468 apiece. The stock has recorded significant gains in recent days, amid buzz over Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s prospective meeting on rare earth magnets. More than 1.9 crore shares of GMDC were involved in active trade so far today, which is nearly three times higher than its 10-day average volume. NLC India shares gained over 5 percent to trade at Rs 242 apiece, snapping a two-day losing streak. This comes amid buzz over the state-owned company's plans to list its renewable energy arm NIRL. In an interview to PTI, NLC India Chairman and Managing Director (CMD) Prasanna Kumar Motupalli said that the public sector enterprise is targeting to raise Rs 4,000 crore through the initial public offering route and will file draft papers with markets regulator SEBI in the first quarter of 2026-27. ""We are targeting Rs 4,000 crore through IPO route… So by September we will be in a position to ramp up our renewable assets through NIRL and by March 2026 we will be able to complete the legal and the financial due diligence and in the first quarter of 2026-27 we will be going for DRHP through the SEBI,"" the CMD told PTI. Earlier in May, NLC India had signed a MoU with Indian Rare Earths Limited (IREL) for collaboration in the field of critical minerals The sharp rise in the share price comes on the back of heavy trading volumes. More than 36 lakh shares of the company were involved in active trade today so far, as seen as 1.30 pm. This is nearly 3.5 times that of its 10-day average volume.

"Coal India's 'attractiveness' based on cheap valuation an 'optical illusion', says Choice Institutional Equities",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/coal-india-s-attractiveness-based-on-cheap-valuation-an-optical-illusion-says-choice-broking-13307387.html,"Shares of Coal India, world's largest coal producer, flat on a YTD basis, could be a 'Value Trap' according to Choice Institutional Equities, as the 'attractiveness' based on cheap valuation is an 'optical illusion', rating the stock as a 'Sell'. ""The stock trades at cheap valuation multiples of ~5x/9x/1x FY27E forward EV/EBITDA, P/E and EV/CE respectively. These headline multiples make the stock look attractive, but we believe it is a Value Trap as these metrics conceal more than they reveal,"" said a Choice Institutional Equities note. The brokerage has cited five key 'pillars' to its investment thesis which has gone into the bearish call on Coal India. 1) Pricing: The brokerage said the discounted pricing compared to imported coal, and an unfavourable sales mix has made CIL's business model 'questionable', making the brokerage believe that its motto is 'not profit driven'. At the current Fuel Supply Agreements (FSA), Coal India does not recover its cost of production, Choice Institutional Equities said. 2) Big capex, flat EBIT momentum: The note has compared Coal India's situation to 'running on a tread mill to cover distance'. Over FY26E-29E, CIL will spend a whopping Rs 80,000 crore, which amounts to around 53% of the operating cash flow on capex, yet its EBIT growth is expected to be negative over FY24-29E, said Choice Institutional Equities. 3) Restrictions on cash: Coal India's net cash balance of around Rs 32,800 crore amounts to 14% of its market capitalisation, but there are provisions worth Rs 74,500 crore which may need to be set off against this cash balance. 4) Falling GCV: The Gross Calorific Value (GCV) of Coal India's output has been trending lower over the past 10 years, hurting realisations and profitability. Choice Institutional Equities said it sees 'no reason' to believe this trend would reverse. 5) After capex, all free cash flow paid as dividends: Choice Institutional Equities said it believes a realistic way to value Coal India would be to focus on its dividend paying potential. The brokerage in its note said that the base case scenario for its target price is Rs 290/share, while the upside (10-15% probability event) assigns a value of Rs 500/share, and the downside scenario (10-15% probability event) values the stock at Rs 225/share. Coal India is allocated coal mines without having to bid for them, hence, according to the brokerage, the PSU is fulfilling the government's mandate of supplying coal to the nation. However, Choice Institutional Equities added that any 'reversal' in government policy to align coal prices with a 'profit maximization motive' will challenge its Sell recommendation.

However, higher treasury gains led to an earnings beat, with PAT at Rs8.0bn/RoA at 0.7%. NIM held steady at 2.5%, aided by a reduction in RIDF deposits and the recent SA/TD rate cuts, though partially offset by adverse asset repricing. However, the bank expects NIM to slip in 2Q due to lending rate cuts. Yes’s retail portfolio continues to exhibit stress with slippage ratio of 2.5%, which we believe had led to management churn. Recently, SMBC agreed to acquire 20% stake from SBI (13.19% of the 24% sold) and other banks (6.81% of the total 9.7% stake sold) at sale price of Rs21.5/sh (implying 1.3x FY27E ABV). However, Outlook The transaction is still pending RBI approval and so the bank has halted its search for a new CEO. Factoring in the 1Q beat, we revise up FY26E EPS by 5% and in turn our TP by ~6% to Rs17 (rolling fwd on 1x Jun-27E ABV) from Rs16.

AUM growth moderated to 17.9% YoY/1.7% QoQ, largely due to a sharp decline (23% YoY/7% QoQ) in Unsecured businesses (MFI and Credit Card). This, along with rising stress in the used HCV/SCV segments, MFI and the South-based secured mortgage portfolio, led to a 19bps increase in GNPA to 2.5%, as also credit cost. The bank expects the margin to remain soft in 2Q, albeit to improve thereafter. It has also revised its credit cost guidance for FY26 by 10bps to 1% of average assets due to persistent stress in the MFI portfolio, while refraining from providing FY26 RoA guidance, citing macro and asset quality uncertainties.

Revenue declined 10.6%/4.8% QoQ/YoY, below our estimates. The management attributed the weak revenue growth performance mainly to 4 factors. a) A large digital native client structurally shifted to sourcing directly from MNOs in one country. b) Decline in volumes from CPaaS aggregators. c) Termination of certain low-margin customer contracts. d) Realization pressure in domestic volume. Billable transactions were flat QoQ, albeit grew 5.9% YoY, whereas average realization declined 10.6%/10.1% QoQ/YoY to ~27paise. EBITDAM expanded by 80bps QoQ on the back of the 210bps expansion in gross margin, which was though partially offset by the rise in employee costs due to salary hike. Forex loss of Rs247mn caused a miss on reported profit in Q1. The management refrained from providing specific revenue growth/margin guidance for FY26, considering the continued softness in the A2P SMS segment, customer shift to alternate channels, and macro uncertainty; however, it intends to defend gross margins at the current level and deliver sustainable profitable growth over the medium term.

The higher margin contraction during 1Q (down 39bps QoQ) was mainly due to the impact of recent rate cuts, change in portfolio mix toward secured loans, and sticky funding cost. The bank expects NIM to remain under pressure in 2Q; however, it expects NIM to improve thereon. After consuming the contingent buffer in FY25, the bank has again started re-building buffer at 1% on JLG MFI loans; it still expects credit costs to ease gradually as Card/MFI stress moderates, thus enabling it to deliver ~1% exit RoA in 4QFY26. We cut our FY26E/27E EPS by 6%/5%, mainly due to lower margins; however, Outlook We expect the bank’s RoA to improve to 0.7-1.2% over FY26-28E, from 0.5% in FY25.

Credit growth moderated a bit to 11.5% YoY, owing to slower growth in retail loans, while the bank continues to accelerate growth in the better-yielding SME/BB segments. The bank believes that NIM should compress in 2Q due to swifter rate cuts, partly offset by the recent SA rate cut in June. Notwithstanding the expected near-term margin pressure across the sector (including for ICICIB), Outlook We believe the bank is well positioned to deliver 2.1-2.3% RoA over FY26-28E, aided by better cost management, improving fees, and contained LLP. Thus, we retain BUY with an unchanged TP of Rs1,600, on 2.6x June 27E ABV and subsidiaries’ value at Rs260/sh.

Buy HDFC Bank; target of Rs 2300: Emkay,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/buy-hdfc-bank-target-of-rs-2300-emkay-13307814.html,"Emkay's research report on HDFC Bank HDFC Bank is gradually stepping up credit growth, although margin slipped by 23bps QoQ from a higher base in 4Q due to swift rate cuts and lower interest on IT refund. The bank registered one-off gains from HDB Fin OFS in the IPO which it prudently utilized to shore-up floating/contingent provision buffer to the tune of Rs107bn, with o/s now at Rs366bn/1.4% of loans; this hence makes the balance sheet (BS) much more resilient. With liquidity improving, HDFCB guides to further accelerate growth in H2FY26, in line with the system, and outpace the system growth in FY27 and thus reduce the growth gap with large peers. This, along with shifting portfolio mix toward retail/SME and substitution of high-cost eHDFCL borrowings with deposits, should drive-up the bank’s margins over FY27-28E and in turn the RoA to 1.9-2%.

This superlative performance was, however, dampened by the exit of Dr Om Manchanda who, during his two-decade tenure as MD, fortified DLPL’s leadership position. The current management team, comprising of the CEO and CFO, brings nearly three decades of collective experience to the organization, ensuring stability and continuity. With their continued focus on the existing go-to-market strategy—centered around network expansion, portfolio addition, and bundled testing, we believe DLPL is well-positioned to capitalize on industry tailwinds and sustain its market leadership.

The mgmt guides to sustained double-digit growth in FY26, led by replacement (continued higher growth in 2Ws/CVs; market share gains in the high margin +17inch PCR, 150cc+ motorcycles), and OEMs (rising wallet share, market share across categories). The mgmt expects margin uptick in Q2FY26, aided by a) 1-2% potential drop in RM costs (vs earlier estimate of flat costs in Q2); b) continued pricing discipline. Camso would be consolidated from Sep-25 (not built-in). We believe CEAT stands out on its superior growth visibility, led by high exposure to consumer-facing categories (2Ws/PVs) and sustained share gains (in OEMs, replacement). The demand and margin cycle for the tyre industry is turning positive, and margin revival looks promising. Outlook To reflect such developments and our positive stance on CEAT, we hoist our TP by ~12% to Rs4,600 at 20x Jun-27E PER (18x earlier); retain BUY.

Despite repo cut of 100bps, company expects NIM of 3.5% in FY26 (3.6% in FY25) as (1) certain portions of bank and NHB borrowings would be repriced lower due to their floating nature and (2) only 5% loans shifted from annual to quarterly reset (67% still at annual reset). Hence, we raise FY26E NIM by 9bps to 3.46%. While both Karnataka and Telangana are stabilizing in business terms, recovery has been slower due to state-specific issues. Disbursal and loan growth targets for FY26 are Rs105-110bn and 12-13%, respectively; we are factoring 11% loan growth as KTK and TL are yet to improve materially. Competition from larger peers and banks would be a key factor in achieving growth as per the guidance. Outlook We maintain multiple of 1.8x on Mar’27 ABV, but slightly raise TP to Rs875 from Rs860.

Apollo Hospitals eyes new international markets as Bangladesh patient flow remains muted,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/apollo-hospitals-eyes-new-international-markets-as-bangladesh-patient-flow-remains-muted-13307547.html,"Apollo Hospitals, India's largest healthcare provider, is expanding patient outreach to new markets such as Iraq, Oman and Southeast Asia, even as it expects Bangladesh patient volumes to return to normal by the end of the year. This strategy comes as the hospital group aims to mitigate the impact of geopolitical shifts affecting its revenue due to a significant dip in number of Bangladeshi patients visiting India. “We are now optimistic that we can look at improved volumes coming from international,"" said Apollo Hospitals managing director Suneeta Reddy said in an interview to Moneycontrol. The company has looked at different markets that will contribute. “This includes Iraq, Oman, some of the Middle East countries, as well as Africa. We are looking at surrounding Southeast Asia,” she added. The company has signed a contract with Indonesia, which is not about patient reference “but being able to share knowledge and therefore work with hospitals in Indonesia, which should benefit the hospital immensely”, she said. Bangladesh used to account for around 45 percent of all medical visas issued by India. However, in 2024, these visas declined by 28.2 percent as India restricted visas to following the ouster of the Sheikh Hasina government, subsequent political unrest, and rising anti-India sentiment. The drop in Bangladesh business led to a drop of at least Rs 100 crore in revenue for FY25, representing a 1.5 percent dip. The decline was particularly noticeable in the third and fourth quarters, as hospitals in Chennai and Kolkata get a bulk of Bangladeshi patients. Reddy is optimistic about Bangladeshi patients returning to India due to cost advantage. ""I believe they're going to Turkey, which is something that they have chosen to do, and some probably to Thailand. But in terms of cost, I think, you know, we still have a huge advantage, and we just need to rebuild those relationships, which I'm sure will happen by the end of the year,"" she said. Reddy is also confident of India's long-term appeal as a healthcare destination. ""… I think it won't happen overnight, but I'm optimistic that patients will prefer India as a healthcare destination, and definitely Apollo,"" she said. The hospital group is implementing mitigation strategies, including a sharper focus on high-end specialties such as cardiology, oncology, neurosciences, gastro sciences, and orthopaedics, which are have increased their contribution to revenue. Apollo is also enhancing its local market share by attracting patients from surrounding areas to its hospitals in metropolitan cities. The number of medical visas issued by India reached an all-time high of 597,196 in 2023 but Bangladesh, along with Yemen and Somalia, which, too, have wrecked by social unrest, pulled down the number to 463,725 in 2024. International patients are much sought after by hospitals, as they pay 15-20 percent premiums and spends are largely out-of-pocket. They come to India to avail advanced tertiary care such as organ transplants, bypass surgeries and joint replacements. Along with healthcare, the patients and their family members also spend money on accommodation, travel and other purchases, helping the economy indirectly."

Margins (NIM + fee) improved by ~7bps due to moderating CoFs. LTF has completed the integration of the acquired GL business and plans to expand branches to ~300 (from 135 now; including new geographies). Credit cost remained elevated in Q1 (Rs3bn of macro overly utilized in Q1) and the management expects MFI stress to peak in Q2FY26, with the growth momentum returning in H2. The focus on acquiring prime and near-prime customers, along with a broader rollout of Cyclops, is expected to help contain FY26 credit cost at 2.3–2.5%. Additionally, the mgmt plans to rebuild macro buffers using recoveries from the SR book, where several accounts are in advanced stages of resolution and proceeds are expected in FY27– 28. Outlook Incorporating the Q1 performance and the outlook for H2, we tweak our estimates, resulting in 30-50bps change in FY26-28E RoE and 3-5% change in FY26-28E EPS; we retain REDUCE with a revised Jun-26E TP of Rs190 (up 6% from Rs180), implying FY27E P/B of 1.6x.

Buy JK Cement; target of Rs 7300: Emkay Global Financial,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-jk-cement-target-of-rs-7300-emkay-global-financial-13307633.html,"Emkay Global Financial' research report on JK Cement JK Cement (JKCE) reported standalone EBITDA of Rs6.75bn (up 41% YoY, albeit down 9% QoQ), beating our estimate (Rs5.9bn). Gray cement volumes were up ~15% YoY, despite the early monsoons, implying continued market share gains in core regions, incl the Bihar market. Volume growth was robust, coupled with mild pricing gains, as gray cement realization was up 0.8% QoQ (~Rs40/t). Realization gains with operating leverage benefits offset the inflation in variable costs, resulting in blended EBITDA/t of Rs1,247 (Emkay: Rs1,160), which is up 23% YoY and flat QoQ. JKCE is on track to commission the 4mtpa Panna clinker line-2 and 6mtpa grinding units (3mtpa each in Central India and Bihar) by Dec-25. Enthused by JKCE’s strong volume growth and the industry’s pricing resilience in Q2FY25TD, we raise FY26E/27E EBITDA by ~9% each and introduce FY28 estimates. Outlook We value JKCE at 17x (unchanged) EV/EBITDA on Q1FY28E EBITDA (rolling forward basis) and arrive at revised up target price of Rs7,300 (earlier Rs6,375; up 14.5%); maintain BUY.

Over the next 2-3 quarters, Eternal is set to gradually make a transition in the quick commerce (QCom) business, from its current marketplace model to an inventory ownership model; this will drive ~100bps margin expansion, albeit require net working capital of ~18 days. The management sees enough room for storecount expansion in all cities, to 3,000 stores from the 1,544 currently. Food delivery GOV grew 16% YoY, and the management expects FY26 GOV growth at 15-20%. We believe QCom has a long growth runway and Blinkit is seen capitalizing well on this. As QCom is currently in the ‘landgrab’ phase, we believe EBITDA breakeven for Blinkit is still some time away. Food delivery is likely to remain a cash cow for the company, and we expect the business to see 20%+ EBITDA CAGR over the long term.

"Brokers uneasy with ‘Fit and Proper’ norms, raise concerns with Sebi",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/brokers-uneasy-with-fit-and-proper-norms-raise-concerns-with-sebi-13307349.html,"In a recent meeting with capital market regulator Sebi, market intermediaries once again flagged off concerns over the controversial ‘Fit and Proper’ criteria, and while it remains unclear whether Chairman Tuhin Kanta Pandey offered any concrete assurance of a review, the matter appears to be a growing source of unease among brokers. The concerns stem from a Sebi notification issued on November 17, 2021 which outlines stringent standards for individuals in key managerial roles. Beyond integrity, honesty, ethical conduct and reputation, the criteria specify that a person must not be facing a criminal complaint or FIR filed by Sebi, nor be charge-sheeted by any law enforcement agency in connection with economic offences. This includes agencies such as the Police Economic Offences Wing (EoW), Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO), and the Enforcement Directorate (ED). Brokers are specifically urging Sebi to reconsider these two provisions. These conditions, they argue, create compliance hurdles and disrupt continuity in roles such as principal officers, directors, managing partners, compliance officers, and other key management personnel. According to the notification, individuals who fail to meet the criteria - either due to a pending Sebi complaint or chargesheet - must be replaced within 30 days of disqualification. The regulations also impact promoters and controlling shareholders of a company, as failing to meet the ‘Fit and Proper’ standard implies they are barred from exercising voting rights and must divest their stake within six months. Non-compliance could lead to the criteria being invoked against the intermediary entity itself. Brokers claim the rules undermine an individual’s fundamental right to livelihood, especially since disqualification can occur before a court has established guilt. They are also warn of potential misuse, where malicious actors could file frivolous complaints or FIRs to destabilize brokerage firms. Often, charge sheets are filed, but individuals are acquitted later during trial, making the mere filing of a charge sheet an unreliable basis for regulatory action, they argue. The requirement to quickly restructure an organization’s leadership is another major concern. Sudden changes could disrupt operations, impact regulatory compliance in overseas jurisdictions, and threaten business continuity, espcially for brokers with cross-border operations. Also Read: Merchant bankers are gearing up for a ‘beauty parade’ in anticipation of NSE’s IPO There are also practical challenges with the mandated divestment of stake. Brokers point out that enforcement agencies may not allow a charge-sheeted individual to divest their holdings, making the regulation unworkable in such scenarios. In listed entities, any stake sale or change in control could trigger an open offer, which becomes unfeasible if the stakeholder in question is under legal scrutiny, as buyers are unlikely to step forward. Even inter-se transfers, brokers say, may require substantial capital, often difficult to mobilize. Lock-in periods and heavy tax liabilities further complicate matters, making compliance nearly impossible in some cases. Also Read: Sebi nod for Jane Street’s trading comeback still awaited While discussions are ongoing, brokers are hoping for a more pragmatic framework that balances regulatory oversight with business realities and the fundamental rights of individuals. An email seeking comments from Sebi did not elicit any response till the time of publishing the story. As per regulatory sources, these amendments in ‘Fit and Proper’ provisions were made after the NSEL scam so that brokers who are not in compliance can be deterred from the market."

"Bajaj Finance Q1 Preview: Double-digit NII, profit growth likely on healthy loan growth",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/bajaj-finance-q1-preview-double-digit-nii-profit-growth-likely-on-healthy-loan-growth-13307408.html,"India’s largest non-bank lender, Bajaj Finance, is poised to deliver double-digit growth in both net interest income (NII) and net profit for the April–June quarter (Q1FY26), buoyed by robust loan growth and declining credit costs. The NBFC heavyweight is slated to announce its first-quarter results on July 24, 2025. According to Moneycontrol's poll, Bajaj Finance’s NII is expected to jump 27 percent year-on-year (YoY) to about Rs 10,628 crore in Q1FY26, compared with Rs 8,365 crore in the same quarter last year. Meanwhile, net profit is estimated to grow 19 percent YoY to nearly Rs 4,646 crore, up from Rs 3,912 crore in Q1FY25. Estimates of analysts polled by Moneycontrol are shown to be in a narrow range, meaning any positive or negative surprises may elicit a sharp reaction in the stock price. Among the brokerages polled, Kotak Institutional Equities rolled out the most bullish projections while Motilal Oswal forecasted the slowest growth for Bajaj Finance. What factors are driving the earnings? Strong loan growth: Analysts at Axis Securities expect the company’s loan book to maintain its momentum in Q1FY26, projecting an impressive 26 percent YoY growth and about 5 percent sequential growth compared with the March quarter. Margin moderation: According to Kotak analysts, net interest margins (NIM) are expected to moderate slightly, contracting by approximately 22 basis points YoY to 9.5 percent, down from 9.7 percent in Q1FY25. Easing credit costs: Motilal Oswal analysts have forecast a decline in credit costs, estimating a 20 basis points quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) reduction to around 2.1 percent in Q1FY26. What to look out for in the quarterly show? Investors and analysts will be closely tracking management’s commentary on asset quality trends and any signals about credit costs. Updates on the lender’s progress in its Loan Repayment System (LRS) initiatives and forward-looking growth guidance will also be in focus.

The earnings momentum may pace up further tracking UTCEM’s commentary (echoed by our channel checks) of firm prices sustaining in the seasonally weak Q2. In our view, firm prices (at current levels) in Q2 have the potential to shore up FY26 consensus EBITDA (our estimates being ~11% higher vs. consensus). Further, it is heartening to see UTCEM walkingthe-talk with its efficiency enhancement measures across – reducing lead distance, rising CC ratio, increase in share of premium cement sales and higher share of green power. Factoring in these benefits, we revise up our FY27E EBITDA by ~4% (keeping FY26E broadly unchanged). Outlook We continue to value UTCEM at 19x FY27E EV/EBITDA and maintain BUY with a revised TP of INR 14,600.

EBITDA margin (% of NOV) improved ~60bps QoQ in Q1FY26 despite adding 243 stores (ISec est.: 220) with steady take rate and contribution margin. We believe this is due to rationalisation of marketing spends as competitive intensity cooled off, something we had highlighted earlier from our channel checks. Management reiterated 2,000 stores target by Q3 and guided for 100bps adj. EBITDA margin expansion from pivoting to an inventory-led model. 70% YoY NOV expansion in Delhi, called out in the shareholder letter, is a key positive which explains Blinkit’s aspirations to reach 3,000 stores in medium term. 13% NOV growth in food delivery, though lower than estimated, can be understood given the management transition. Improving demand outlook in FD is another key positive. Maintain BUY. Outlook We maintain BUY on Eternal with a three-stage DCF-based target price of INR 315. (earlier INR 310).

Buy Havells India; target of Rs 1800: ICICI Securities,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-havells-india-target-of-rs-1800-icici-securities-2-13307371.html,"ICICI Securities research report on Havells India While the impact of early monsoon on off-take of RAC, fans and coolers was higher-than-expected, we believe the impact is transitory in nature and there is negligible impact on long-term value creation. We believe (1) Havells is likely to benefit via market share gains as smaller/ unorganised players are likely to be more impacted. (2) The company has invested in solar products and it considers solar as one of the major growth drivers in medium-long term. (3) The company has initiated various cost saving initiatives and it augurs well for long term. (4) We note other segments such as stabilizers and cables and wires continue to generate healthy demand. With real estate cycle progressing well, there is potentially strong demand for finishing products such as wires, lighting, switches in H2FY26 and FY27. (5) Havells has materially increased its investments in cables and wires which is also expected to emerge as one of major value drivers. Outlook We cut FY26-27E PAT by 7.3%-9.1% to factor in weak Q1FY26 and impact of high inventory at company and channel levels. At our DCF-based revised TP of INR 1,800, implied P/E works out to 53x FY27E. Maintain BUY.
