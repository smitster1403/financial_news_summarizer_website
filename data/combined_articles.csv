However, 7% decline in Kumiai’s (innovator) guidance on sales of pyroxa for Nov’24-Oct’25, is likely to affect PI’s CSM segment with revenue clocking 6% CAGR in FY25–28E compared with 21% CAGR in the past 5 years. The pharma business, still in ramp-up, is projected to grow ~70% in FY26 and break even by FY28 at ~Rs5bn revenue. The domestic business is expected to deliver ~6% CAGR, led by biologicals, while core formulations remain subdued. We estimate consolidated revenue/EBITDA/PAT CAGR at ~7%/8%/7% over FY25–28E, supported by new CSM launches, biologicals and pharma scale-up. Outlook At 28x FY27E EPS, the stock is trading slightly above its sector average. While R&D spending (3% of sales) remains strong, we await the next spark that could once again spur investors’ interests.

Hold SRF; target of Rs 2947: Prabhudas Lilladher,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/hold-srf-target-of-rs-2947-prabhudas-lilladher-13587238.html,"Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on SRF Based on investigation of Apr’23-Mar’24 data, Indian government has applied anti-dumping duty (ADD) of ~USD4,500/mt on import of R134a from China. SRF is the only manufacturer of R134a in India. However, currently, the difference between import-export realizations has already narrowed down, which would limit the benefit of ADD. Our estimate suggests that for every USD1/kg benefit in domestic realization, impact on FY27 EBITDA would be ~2%. For every 1,000mt additional sales, the impact would also be limited to ~2% of EBITDA. Outlook The stock is trading at 43x FY27 EPS. Based on SOTP, valuing the chemicals segment at 27x FY27 EV/EBITDA and packaging and technical textiles at 11x, we arrive at a target of Rs2,947 (earlier Rs3,071). In our earlier note, we had highlighted how R32 prices are likely to come down. Bearing the same in mind, we re-iterate our Hold rating on the stock.

Drug maker Wockhardt rallies over 9 percent as White House exempts pharma imports from nations with trade pacts,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/drug-maker-wockhardt-rallies-over-9-percent-as-white-house-exempts-pharma-imports-from-nations-with-trade-pacts-13587233.html,"Shares of Wockhardt are higher by more than 9 percent on September 29, marking its best day in nearly four months, as investors added bets after clarification emerged that US President Trump's fresh tariff on branded pharma imports will not apply to countries with which American has negotiated agreements - a relief for the European Union and Japan - a move that is expected to help the Indian drugmaker which has manufacturing facilities in Europe. Wockhardt had acquired French firm Negma to strengthen manufacturing capacity in Europe for formulations and APIs, aside of manufacturing and injectable facility in North Wales, UK. The drug maker has presence in USA, UK, Ireland, Switzerland, Mexico, Russia and many other countries, with research facilities in India and UK, and a manufacturing facility in Ireland. Wockhardt has a significant present in Europe and India with nearly 78 percent of its global revenue coming from international businesses. Exemptions for Trade Partners? While announcing the pharma tariffs, Trump did not specify if the levies would apply over and above the existing tariffs as defined with trade agreements with EU and Japan, and the UK. On September 26, Bloomberg News quoted a US government official who said duties on pharma imports from EU will not exceed 15 percent, as is the tariff framework of the deal. Drug imports from Japan too will be levied the rate defined by the trade pact, said the official. EU Commission's deputy spokesperson Olof Gill had on Friday cited the trade agreement as an 'insurance' against Trump's fresh and higher tariffs on pharma imports into US. “This clear all-inclusive 15% tariff ceiling for EU exports represents an insurance policy that no higher tariffs will emerge for European economic operators. The EU is the only trade partner to achieve this outcome with the US,” Olof Gill had said. Wockhardt's Global Footprint The drugmaker is amongst the top three Indian generic companies in UK, and sixth largest generic supplier in retailand hospital channel in Ireland. This is being updated"

"Pharma stocks rebound as tariff fears ease; Sun Pharma, Lupin, Cipla lead gains",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/pharma-stocks-rebound-as-tariff-fears-ease-sun-pharma-lupin-cipla-lead-gains-13587063.html,"The Nifty Pharma index climbed 1 percent on September 29, breaking a five-day losing streak as most constituents traded higher. The rebound followed a sharp sell-off last week after US President Donald Trump announced steep 100 percent tariffs on branded and patented drugs starting October 1, part of its broader push to onshore pharma manufacturing, create jobs, and cut foreign reliance. Out of the 20 index stocks, 15 advanced, led by Sun Pharma, Lupin, Cipla, Zydus Life, Biocon, Granules India, Torrent Pharma, Laurus Labs, Aurobindo Pharma, and Glenmark Pharma, which gained up to 2 percent. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog Analysts pointed out that since India primarily exports generic drugs to the US, which remain outside the tariff ambit, the recent weakness was largely sentiment-driven. HSBC said only Sun Pharma has meaningful exposure to patented medicines in the US, adding that while the worst-case earnings hit could be 8 to 10 percent by FY27, it maintained a “Buy” call on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,850 per share. Jefferies also highlighted Sun Pharma and Biocon as the most exposed but noted that generic exports and Indian CRDMO supplies are unlikely to be impacted, even as contradictions with recent trade pacts mean clarity on the tariff structure is still awaited. According to Pharmexcil, the US accounts for over 35 percent of India’s total pharma exports, valued at $10 billion in FY25. For several leading drug makers, the US remains their largest market, contributing as much as 40–50 percent of revenues. For example, Dr Reddy’s derives 47 percent of its earnings from the US, while Sun Pharma earns 37 percent. Lupin, Zydus Lifesciences, and Aurobindo Pharma each generate over $1 billion in revenues from the US market alone. In short, if tariffs are eventually extended to complex generics and specialty medicines, the impact on Indian pharma companies could be significant.

"Bharat Electronics top Nifty gainer on Army's likely RFP for QRSAM system, or the Anant Shashtra air defence",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/bharat-electronics-top-nifty-gainer-on-receiving-army-s-rfp-for-qrsam-system-or-the-anant-shashtra-air-defence-13587062.html,"Shares of state-owned Bharat Electronics were sharply higher by more than 2 percent to emerge as the top gainer on Nifty 50 index, following reports over the weekend that the defence PSU has received the much-awaited Request For Proposal (RFP) from the Indian Army to supply Quick Reaction Surface-to-Air Missiles (QRSAM) for an new air defence system to be inducted as 'Anant Shastra' cover. Over the weekend, news agency ANI had reported that the tender has been opened to develop the ambitious missile system, costing about Rs 30,000 crore, to enhance the air defence along the western and northern borders. BEL Invited for QRSAM RFP It is expected that the tender has sought a formal invitation for proposal, also known as Request for Proposal (RFP) for 5-6 regiments of Anant Shastra (QRSAM) systems has been sought, which could result in an order for BEL if the Army accepts BEL's bid. BEL manufactures Quick Reaction Surface to Air Missiles (QRSAM) capable of 'search on move, track on move and fire on short halts', according to the company. For the QRSAM, the approval of Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) was received in July 2025, which BEL had called as 'good progress' during its June quarter earnings call. Now, the RFP has to be issued to the company. ""We are confident to get this order by February, March as of now..."" BEL had said in June. Major Order by Q4FY26 ""It may not slip to Q1 of next year. We are confident we may get in the Q4 of this year itself QRSAM because the progress looks really good for us and DAC approval already has come,"" BEL added, sounding confident of bagging 'major portion' of the order, some of which will 'spill over to Q1FY27 also, but majority of the orders are expected in Q3 and Q4FY26. For the project, DRDO (Defence Research and Development Organisation) is the lead developer with Bharat Electronics providing the radars and electronic systems while Bharat Dynamics will be responsible for the production of the missile systems. There are likely other private partners, too, including L&T, which will be contributing to the launcher and other sub-systems. BEL had said that it is confident of cornering a 'considerable portion' of orders for sub-systems for the project, even though Procurement and Compliance (P&C) related details are being worked out. ""So, we have already started discussing with them about the configuration, final effect about the final bomb. So those activities are going on at a good pace. So we are hoping in the next 3 to 6 months, we will get a considerable portion of subsystems order with us. So that is a -- good progress is there, but this is having some five, six different types of subsystems,"" Manoj Jain, CMD of BEL had said during the June quarter earnings call. BEL already has an orderbook of over Rs 80,000 crore, and the QRSAM project is expected to be a major contributor to the future order pipeline for the company. The PSU has been developing systems and testing them jointly with DRDO, along with other subsystems involved in the project. BEL's annual revenue is nearing Rs 30,000 crore, and with an orderbook of around Rs 27000 crore, the management is confident of a -15 percent revenue growth projection going forward, even at this large base. ""So, I don't see 16-17 percent will be a challenge for me, but definitely it will not go below 15 percent, that much I can assure you. It will be between 15-17 percent, 17.5-18 percent, somewhere, we will try to stabilize around that type of a growth pattern based on the order inflow and type of projects where we are involved right now,"" CMD Manoj Jain had said in June 2025. Boost to India's Air Defence With a range of around 30 km, this proposed air defence system is expected to complement the existing MRSAM and Akash missile system in the short and medium ranges. As per ANI, this air defence system is being put to trial for night operations as well. The project is part of Army's preparedness against drone and missile threats on the western border, as was seen during the recent Op Sindoor against terror targets inside Pakistan during May 2025, where India's air defences had thwarted the use of Chinese-made missiles and Turkish drones along the border. Brokerage View Motilal Oswal in a note on September 29 said Bharat Electronics is currently at 48.2x and 40.3x the FY26e and FY27e EPS and maintained its Buy call on the stock with a two-year target price of Rs 490 per share, which is around 24 percent higher from current levels. ""Our estimates already factor in large-sized order inflows from QRSAM and next-generation corvettes to materialize between FY26 and FY27. We also bake in longer gestation period for these orders and expect a sales/EBITDA/PAT CAGR of 18%/17%/17% over FY25-28,"" said MOSL. The note highlighted some key risks to the outlook, citing a slowdown in order inflows, rising competition, or delays in the finalization of tenders, along with a rise in commodity prices among key factors.

Asian Equities (Mixed) Asian markets were trading mixed in the early trade on Monday with Topix down 1.6 percent, while Kospi up 1.4 percent. US Equities (Up) Gains in Wall Street indexes on Friday were not enough to erase a loss for the week while resilient consumer spending supported longer-dated Treasury yields and gold rose as a steady inflation reading supported bets on future Federal Reserve rate cuts. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.65%, the S&P 500 rose 0.59% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.44%.

Asian currencies (Gain) Except China Renminbi, all other Asian currencies gained in the early trade on Monday with South Korean Won leading the gainers followed by Malaysian Ringgit, Indonesian Rupiah, Taiwan Dollar, Japanese Yen. Crude (Slips) Oil prices slipped nearly 1% on Monday after Iraq's Kurdistan region resumed crude oil exports via Turkey over the weekend and as OPEC+ plans another oil output hike in November, adding to global supplies. Gold (Gains) Gold edged higher — after notching a sixth weekly gain — as traders weighed a potential US government shutdown that could delay the release of pivotal jobs data this week and potentially cloud the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy path.

A total of 2,337 shares saw selling pressure compared to 460 advancing shares on the NSE. The market may see a bounce-back after the significant selling pressure of last week, but sustainability is the key to watch. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Rajesh Palviya, Senior Vice President Research (Head Technical Derivatives) at Axis Securities Ashok Leyland | CMP: Rs 141.93 Ashok Leyland is in a strong uptrend across all time frames, forming a series of higher tops and bottoms. On the weekly chart, the stock has also confirmed a ""rounding bottom"" formation breakout at Rs 134 levels on a closing basis. This breakout is accompanied by huge volumes, which signifies increased participation. The stock is well-placed above its 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-day SMAs, which reconfirms a bullish trend, and these averages are also inching up along with the price rise. The weekly Bollinger Bands buy signal indicates increased momentum. The weekly and monthly strength indicator RSI also indicates rising strength. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 150, Rs 157 Stop-Loss: Rs 135 Minda Corporation | CMP: Rs 571.3 Since August 2024, Minda Corporation has been consolidating within the Rs 550–450 range; however, with last week's close, the stock has decisively surpassed the weekly down-sloping trendline resistance at Rs 562 levels, along with huge volumes, which signals the resumption of the prior uptrend. Currently, the stock is well-placed above its 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-day SMAs, which reconfirms a bullish trend. The daily, weekly, and monthly strength indicator RSI indicates rising strength. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 607, Rs 640 Stop-Loss: Rs 555 Larsen & Toubro | CMP: Rs 3,730 With Friday's strong movement, Larsen & Toubro has decisively surpassed the past 8–9 months' multiple resistance zone of Rs 3,700 levels on a closing basis. Huge volumes on this breakout signify increased participation. The stock is well-placed above its 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-day SMAs, and these averages are also inching up along with the price rise, which reconfirms a bullish trend. The daily Bollinger Band buy signal indicates increased momentum. The daily and weekly strength indicator RSI indicates rising strength. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,855, Rs 3,950 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,700 Osho Krishan, Chief Manager - Technical & Derivative Research at Angel One NTPC | CMP: Rs 337.9 NTPC has recently undergone a notable resurgence, marked by a multi-week breakout observed on the daily chart. The stock has ascended above the 200-day SMA and has also demonstrated a positive crossover among the short-term EMAs. Furthermore, the stock has displayed early indicators of a trend reversal on the SuperTrend indicator, bolstering the bullish outlook. In addition, the MACD signal line has experienced a positive crossover near the zero line, which contributes to the overall bullish sentiment. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 355, Rs 358 Stop-Loss: Rs 322 Shipping Corporation of India | CMP: Rs 225.45 SCI has demonstrated a notable increase over the past week, with a surge in trading volumes, culminating in a sloping trendline breakout on the daily charts. This upward movement has been supported by positive crossovers among the short- and medium-term EMAs. Moreover, the stock exhibits a secular upward trend in its daily chart structure, signaling substantial underlying strength. The optimistic outlook for this stock is further enhanced by a positive crossover observed in the 14-week RSI and the MACD, collectively reinforcing the bullish sentiment. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 238, Rs 240 Stop-Loss: Rs 208 Anshul Jain, Head of Research at Lakshmishree Investments Lumax Auto Technologies | CMP: Rs 1,298.5 Lumax Auto Technologies has broken out of a bullish cup and handle pattern and is displaying strong relative strength compared to the broader indices. Notably, in a week when the index witnessed sharp declines, the stock defied the trend and broke out to fresh all-time highs. A sustained move above Rs 1,270 will add momentum and open the path towards Rs 1,550 levels initially. Both moving averages and momentum indicators are aligned in favour of the bulls, suggesting that the breakout is likely to sustain and attract further participation. The structure remains highly constructive for a continued upmove. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,550 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,240 Aditya Vision | CMP: Rs 572 Aditya Vision has broken out of a bullish 191-day cup and handle pattern on the daily charts. Post-breakout, the stock has formed a bullish flag over the past six sessions — a continuation pattern that strengthens the overall structure. A sustained breakout above Rs 580 will likely trigger follow-through buying and open the way towards Rs 700 levels in the near term. Daily moving averages and momentum indicators remain supportive, suggesting that the upmove has strong potential to sustain further. The technical setup remains firmly in favour of the bulls.

Smallcaps tumble up to 77% as broader indices lag,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/smallcaps-tumble-up-to-77-as-broader-indices-lag-13585260.html,"The broader indices broke a three-week gaining streak and underperformed the main indices as markets remained under pressure throughout the week on worries over fresh tariffs on pharma, higher visa fees by the US, persistent trade concerns, and continued FII selling. For the week, Nifty50 plunged 672.35 points or 2.65 percent to finish at 24,654.70, while the BSE Sensex index declined 2199.77 points or 2.66 percent to end at 80,426.46. BSE mid, large, and smallcap indices declined 3-4.5 percent. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) remained net sellers throughout the week, extending their selling for the 13th consecutive week, as they offloaded equities worth Rs 19,570.03 crore, while Domestic Institutional Investors (DII) continued their buying in 24nd week, as they purchased equities worth Rs 17,411.40 crore. For the month, FII sold equities worth Rs 30,141.68 crore, while DII bought equities worth Rs 55,736.09 crore. All the sectoral indices gave a negative return during the week, with the Nifty IT index plunging 8 percent, the Nifty Realty index shedding 6 percent, the Nifty Pharma index falling 5.2 percent, the Nifty Consumer Durables slipping 4.6 percent, Nifty Defence index declining 4.4 percent. ""This week, the overall market breadth of the Indian equity markets was negative as it factored in the US announcement with respect to H1B visas and the pharma sector. The BSE Sensex and the NSE Nifty index fell in excess of 2% and the decline in the BSE Midcap and the BSE Smallcap was higher at ~4%,"" said Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities. ""All the key sectoral indices ended the week in the red. The US announced stricter norms on H1B visas. Accenture’s FY26 revenue guidance assumes no improvement in discretionary spending at the top end and some deterioration at the bottom end. THE BSE IT index corrected by 7% this week. The BSE healthcare index corrected ~5% this week amid the US announcing 100% tariffs on branded or patented pharma products imported into the US."" ""Auto stocks remained in focus as news reports indicate healthy booking and deliveries in the initial days of the current festive season. Global equity markets were mixed in the past week, with developed markets outperforming the emerging markets. The key global news-flows impacting global markets included continued uncertainty around US trade policies and the ECB maintaining a cautious outlook on growth,"" he added. The BSE Small-cap index declined 4.2 percent with Shankara Building Products, Apollo Pipes, SML Isuzu, MIC Electronics, Prudent Corporate Advisory Services, Sigachi Industries, Cigniti Technologies, SMS Pharmaceuticals, Eimco Elecon (India), Vishnu Prakash R Punglia, IOL Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals, Parsvnath Developers shed up to 77 percent. Zuari Industries, TVS Electronics, Indo Thai Securities, OM Infra, RACL Geartech,Allcargo Terminals, Automotive Stampings and Assemblies rising between 20-30 percent. Where is Nifty50 headed? Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Sustained weakness in heavyweights has accelerated the index’s decline over the past two sessions, with the Nifty now approaching its key support near the 200 DEMA around 24,400. Meanwhile, the sharp correction in mid- and small-cap stocks has further dampened market sentiment. Given this backdrop, we recommend adopting a cautious approach—focusing on fundamentally strong stocks while avoiding aggressive directional bets until clearer signals emerge. Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities A long bear candle was formed on the daily chart on Friday, which indicates a decisive breakdown of crucial supports of around 25000-24900 levels. This is not a good sign and signals more weakness in the short term. A long bear candle has been formed in Nifty on the weekly chart after three weeks of rise, which indicates a possibility of faster downside retracement in the market. The underlying trend of Nifty is sharply negative and the market is now sliding down to the next important support of around 24400-24300 (previous swing lows and 200-day EMA) by next week. Immediate resistance is placed at 24850 levels. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The Nifty broke below the crucial support level of 25,000, which triggered a decline and led to the breach of other intermediate supports. The sentiment remains weak, with immediate and critical support placed in the 24,550–24,500 zone. A decisive breakdown below 24,500 could extend the correction towards 24,150, which corresponds to the 38.20% Fibonacci retracement of the rally from 21,743 to 25,669. On the other hand, if the index holds above 24,500, a sharp recovery can be expected. Amol Athawale, VP Technical Research, Kotak Securities Technically, on weekly charts, Nifty has formed a long bearish candle. On intraday charts, it is holding a lower top formation, which supports further weakness from the current levels. We believe that the short-term market trend is weak, but due to temporary oversold conditions, we could see a pullback rally from the current levels. For traders, 24,800/81200 would act as a key level to watch. Below this, the correction wave is likely to continue. On the downside, the market could retest the levels of 24,500/80300. Further declines may also occur, potentially dragging the index down to 24,350/79800, 24300/79600. Conversely, above 24,800/81200, a pullback formation could continue up to 25,000-25,100/81800-82200. For Bank Nifty, the 20-day SMA or 54,750 would be a crucial zone. Below this, the chances of hitting 54,000-53,800 increase. However, if it sustains above the 20-day SMA or 54,750, it could bounce back to the 50-day SMA or 55,300-55,500. Short-term traders should remain cautious and be very selective, as there is a risk of getting trapped at lower levels.

"Wall Street ends streak of weekly gains, yields rise as investors digest data",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/wall-street-ends-streak-of-weekly-gains-yields-rise-as-investors-digest-data-13585236.html,"Gains in Wall Street indexes on Friday were not enough to erase a loss for the week while resilient consumer spending supported longer-dated Treasury yields and gold rose as a steady inflation reading supported bets on future Federal Reserve rate cuts. Consumer spending climbed slightly more than expected in August while the inflation rate rose to 2.7% from 2.6% in July, data showed, in line with economists' expectations. Analysts said some companies had fended off price pressures by stockpiling in anticipation of tariffs, but some volatility was to be expected ahead of corporate earnings releases in the coming weeks. ""Corporates have been able to withstand (a) tariff hit because they've had inventory build. But the earnings season will become the bigger test because many companies have told us they will start some price increases around the end of the year,"" said Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at Charles Schwab. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.65%, the S&P 500 rose 0.59% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.44%. Individual stocks responded to fresh White House tariffs on goods including pharmaceuticals and trucks. Paccar, which makes most of its trucks for the U.S. market domestically, gained 5%, and drugmaker Eli Lilly rose 1.5%. Richmond Fed Bank President Thomas Barkin told Bloomberg Television he had very low confidence in inflation forecasts, as tariffs continue to impact the economy.The prospect of a potential government shutdown is also adding uncertainty and could disrupt the data releases that investors follow closely for guidance. NOT FALLING OFF A CLIFF Friday's personal consumption expenditures index functions as a key component of the Federal Reserve's inflation outlook. U.S. Treasury yields, which influence borrowing costs, moved little after the data was released. The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes rose 0.7 basis points to 4.181%, from 4.174% late on Thursday. The 30-year bond yield rose 0.5 basis points to 4.7576% from 4.753% late on Thursday. ""The one bright spot was that income and spending were a little bit firmer than expected, which means the consumer isn't falling off a cliff as the market was expecting,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, head of U.S. rates strategy at TD Securities. Gold, a safe haven which usually benefits from lower interest rates, broadly held on to recent gains. Spot prices were last quoted 0.46% higher at $3,766.25 an ounce.Investors now estimate an 89.8% probability of a rate cut in October and a 67% chance of another in December, the CME FedWatch Tool shows. The Fed made its first interest rate cut of the year last week, and signalled further easing was to come. Fed Chair Jerome Powell offered little more direction at a speech on Tuesday, saying the central bank needed to continue balancing, opens new tab the risk of high inflation against a weakening job market. Oil prices rose as Ukrainian drone attacks on Russia infrastructure cut the major energy producer's exports. Brent futures settled at $70.13 a barrel, up 71 cents, or 1.02%. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude finished at $65.72 a barrel, gaining 74 cents, or 1.14%."
Trump’s dual shocks thwart bets on Indian stock market rebound,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/trump-s-dual-shocks-thwart-bets-on-indian-stock-market-rebound-13585213.html,"Call it a case of bad timing for Indian stock bulls. Donald Trump has dealt two fresh blows to investor sentiment just as the market was showing signs of a turnaround. The MSCI India Index has fallen in all five sessions since the US President signed an order to overhaul the H-1B visa program — a move that risks disrupting India’s $280 billion software services industry. His plan to impose a 100% duty on branded or patented pharmaceuticals saw Indian drugmakers join an Asia-wide selloff on Friday. Prior to these shocks, the MSCI India gauge had risen for three straight weeks, adding more than 4% in what was its longest run since May. Trump’s latest salvos have also shaken foreign investors, who seemed to be finally putting in their stride the punishing 50% US tariffs on India that have soured relations between the two nations. Global funds turned sellers of Indian shares in recent sessions following two weeks of purchases. “Escalating US–India tensions add another layer of pressure,” said Jian Shi Cortesi, a fund manager at GAM Investment Management in Zurich. “The related headlines provide investors with an additional nudge to reallocate away from India toward markets displaying stronger momentum, such as China and South Korea.” Constrained by a slowdown in economic growth as well as the pace of corporate earnings expansion, Indian stocks have struggled to keep their momentum in 2025 after rallying for six straight years. The MSCI India gauge has risen around 2% this year, trailing a broader gauge of Asian equities by over 19 percentage points after outperforming it over 2021-2024. Expectations Reset Investors were pinning hopes on a year-end rally in stocks, buoyed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s move earlier to lower nationwide consumption tax — which took effect on Sept. 22, the central bank’s continued focus on growth, and bets that the resumption of trade negotiations with the US will lead to a positive outcome. Those expectations are being reviewed following Trump’s latest actions. The MSCI India gauge’s about 3% decline this week was its biggest since February. A measure of IT stocks lost 7.9% over five sessions, the most since April. The tech sector commands a near-10% weighting on the MSCI gauge — the third-highest. Indians have made up more than 70% of the H-1B visas in the past. Economists have warned that the visa changes risk cutting remittance inflows, and could weaken the local currency, already among Asia’s worst performers. The rupee slid to a record low on Tuesday amid worries that India’s services exports could suffer alongside its tariff-hit merchandise exports. An index of drugmakers lost over 2% on Friday to register its worst daily performance since early August following Trump’s latest tariff salvo. “The underperformance of Indian asset prices looks set to continue,” Gavekal Research’s analysts Udith Sikand and Tom Miller wrote in a note. “The longer the 50% tariffs remain in place, the more likely it is that India’s economic growth disappoints.” Foreign funds have sold Indian stocks worth around $16 billion on a net basis in 2025. That’s on track to be the second-biggest ever outflow following a record $17 billion withdrawal in 2022. The market’s performance would have been much worse this year, if not for the strong equity purchases by local institutions. ‘Quiet Corner’ Some market watchers, such as strategists at HSBC Holdings Plc, are more optimistic. A team led by Herald van der Linde this week upgraded their stance on Indian stocks to overweight from neutral. “In stark contrast to the crowded trades in Korea and Taiwan, India is Asia’s quiet corner,” they wrote. “While earnings growth expectations can fall a little further, valuations are no longer a concern, government policy is becoming a positive factor for equities, and most foreign funds are lightly positioned.” The MSCI India gauge is trading at 21.8 times its 12-month forward earnings, down from a multiple of 24.5 a year ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Overall, investors agree that the near-term outlook for Indian equities, particularly in terms of foreign flows, will continue to be determined by geopolitics. Allspring Global Investments is among those adding exposure to domestically driven sectors such as consumer and financials, which are less vulnerable to Trump’s America First agenda. Hedging costs for Indian equities also climbed this week for the first time in a month. A gauge of 30-day ahead volatility on the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. closed above its 50-day moving average Friday, suggesting traders are bracing for heightened market volatility. Gary Dugan, chief executive officer of the Global CIO Office, said he would shift portfolios toward China and potentially to Latin America if geopolitical tensions with the US spiral."
Sun Pharma may face tariff turbulence in US but HSBC sees limited earnings risk,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/sun-pharma-may-face-tariff-turbulence-in-us-but-hsbc-sees-limited-earnings-risk-13585078.html,"Sun Pharma, India’s largest drugmaker, finds itself in the spotlight following US President Donald Trump’s announcement of a 100% import tariff on branded or patented pharmaceutical products, effective October 1, 2025. While the move is expected to shake up global pharma supply chains, HSBC believes the earnings impact on Sun Pharma may be limited. “Among Indian companies, only Sun Pharma has sizeable sales from patented products in the U.S.,” noted Damayanti Kerai, Analyst, India Healthcare at HSBC. “It reported global sales of $1.2 billion from patented products in FY25, of which the US market accounted for approximately $1.1 billion amounting to 17% of total revenue and 8–10% of consolidated EPS.” Sun Pharma’s patented portfolio, led by its blockbuster psoriasis drug Ilumya, is largely manufactured by global CDMO partners outside US. The drug substance for Ilumya is produced in South Korea, while the finished dose is made in Europe. This fragmented supply chain could complicate tariff compliance. “While this tariff development is broadly negative for Sun Pharma, we think the impact on earnings depends on multiple moving parts—spread of supply chain, IP location of the brand, and use of third-party manufacturers,” Kerai explained. HSBC outlines several mitigation strategies for Sun Pharma, including shifting manufacturing to CDMO partners with US-based plants, leveraging its own three manufacturing facilities in the US, or even acquiring a new plant. With over $3 billion in cash reserves as of June 2025, Sun Pharma has the financial muscle to act. However, HSBC cautions that “moving supply chains, tech-transfer, and plant re-purposing would take considerable time—anywhere from 6 to 24 months.” In its base case, HSBC estimates an 8–10% downside risk to Sun Pharma’s FY26–27 earnings if mitigation measures are delayed or ineffective. Yet, the brokerage remains optimistic. “We maintain our Buy rating and INR 1,850 target price, with no estimate changes,” Kerai affirmed.As the industry awaits Sun Pharma’s official response, the company’s ability to navigate this geopolitical curveball will be closely watched—not just by investors, but by the broader Indian pharma sector. An email sent to Sun Pharma seeking comment on possible impact of the Trump's tariff announcement is yet to elicit response at the time of publishing the story."
Trump’s 100% drug tariff: A mixed bag for India’s CRDMO industry,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/trump-s-100-drug-tariff-a-mixed-bag-for-india-s-crdmo-industry-13585063.html,"US President Donald Trump’s decision to impose a 100 percent import tariff on branded and patented pharmaceutical products from October 1, 2025, may be a mixed bag for India’s Contract Research, Development, and Manufacturing Organisation (CRDMO) sector.India’s pharmaceutical exports to the U.S. stood at $8.73 billion in 2024, accounting for 31 percent of total pharma exports. However, the bulk of these exports are generic drugs, which remain exempt from the new tariff. This offers a temporary cushion to Indian drugmakers, but the long-term impact on the CRDMO sector could be more complex. “Few Indian pharma companies with exposure to non-U.S. domiciled branded formulation or innovator drug companies, who in turn export to the U.S., may face challenges,” said Deepak Jotwani, VP & Sector Head, ICRA. The BCG-IPSO whitepaper “Unleashing the Tiger” highlights India’s growing CRDMO sector, currently valued at $3–3.5 billion, with ambitions to scale to $22–25 billion by 2035. The sector is riding high on global supply chain realignment, pricing pressures, and rising demand for new modalities like biologics and cell therapies. However, Trump’s tariff announcement introduces a new layer of uncertainty. While generics are spared, ambiguity remains around complex generics, specialty medicines, and biologics, segments where Indian CRDMOs are increasingly active. If these are eventually included under the tariff umbrella, Indian firms engaged in R&D and manufacturing for U.S.-bound branded drugs could face headwinds. India’s CRDMOs often serve as contract developers and manufacturers for global pharma giants. If these clients are hit by tariffs, the ripple effect could squeeze margins for Indian CDMOs, especially those involved in high-volume, low-margin production. The Trump administration’s Section 232 investigation into pharma imports, covering APIs, intermediates, and finished drugs, adds further uncertainty, with a final decision expected by March 2026. Despite the risks, the tariff could also accelerate the shift toward cost-effective alternatives, benefiting India’s generics and CRDMO segments in the short term. The BCG-IPSO report notes that India’s CRDMOs enjoy a 70–80% workforce cost advantage and 85% lower infrastructure setup costs compared to the West. With faster project startup times and improved IP regimes, India remains a preferred outsourcing destination. Moreover, companies with US manufacturing facilities under construction are exempt from the tariff, offering a strategic path to mitigate exposure. Several Indian CRDMOs are already expanding footprints in the US, UK, and Europe, positioning themselves as global partners. Syngene International, Cohance are two CRDMOs that have recently acquired facilities in the US. Piramal Pharma, which has facilities both in US and India, offers more flexibility to its customers. But analysts say that the Indian CRDMO industry has to invest on talent, accelerate innovation in biologics and new modalities, diversify markets beyond the US and strengthen local supplier ecosystems to reduce dependency on China and the West."

The tone was weak from the outset and worsened as the day progressed. Eventually, the Nifty closed near the day’s low at 24,654.70, down 0.95%. The decline was broad-based, with pharma and IT stocks leading the fall following U.S. tariff announcements on branded drugs. The broader indices bore the brunt of the sell-off, slipping nearly 2% each. The announcement of tariffs on branded drugs weighed heavily on sentiment, adding to recent concerns over visa policy changes. IT counters were further dragged by weak guidance from global peers, while persistent FII outflows and a weak rupee amplified the pressure. On the technical front, sustained weakness in heavyweights has accelerated the index’s decline over the past two sessions, with the Nifty now approaching its key support near the 200 DEMA around 24,400. Meanwhile, the sharp correction in mid- and small-cap stocks has further dampened market sentiment. Given this backdrop, we recommend adopting a cautious approach—focusing on fundamentally strong stocks while avoiding aggressive directional bets until clearer signals emerge. Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments The Indian market experienced a bloodbath, mirroring the rout across Asian markets. Investor sentiment was rattled by a fresh wave of tariffs targeting the pharmaceuticals, dragging pharma stocks deep into the red. Meanwhile, Accenture’s weaker guidance and job cuts highlighted slowing IT spending, with AI-driven growth failing to meet expectations, prompting a broad sell-off in tech shares.

Gold and silver prices have been hitting fresh record highs consecutively for several sessions this month, dodging market volatility. Jewellery stocks decline: PC Jeweller shares dropped nearly 10 percent to trade at Rs 12.14 apiece. Kalyan Jewellers and Senco Gold shares fell over 3 percent to Rs 448 apiece. PN Gadgil Jewellers and Titan shares meanwhile fell over 2 percent each.

Contracts with December expiry meanwhile hit a lifetime high of Rs 1,14,198 per 10 grams. Domestic gold prices also jumped. The prices have now consolidated slightly, but still remain high. Silver accompanying gold: Along with gold, silver futures also hit fresh lifetime highs. Silver futures with December expiry hit a fresh lifetime high of Rs 1,38,184 per kg earlier this week. The future contracts with March expiry hit an all time high of Rs 1,39,626 per kg today. Analysts note that customers may pause their jewellery purchases when the precious metals are at such high levels. Demand for ornaments is likely to fall 27 percent from a year ago in terms of volume during the three-week buying period, Bloomberg quoted Surendra Mehta, national secretary at the India Bullion and Jewellers Association, as saying. Consumers, especially in big cities, are postponing spending due to high costs, he added. ""The rally is supported by the Fed’s dovish rate-cut outlook and expectations of further easing into late 2025, keeping liquidity strong in bullions. Global uncertainties and declining dollar dependence continue to fuel buying interest in Gold and Silver,"" said Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst - Commodity and Currency, LKP Securities.

This is a nine-month high for the shares of L&T. ""After detailed negotiations, with an objective to expedite the phase 2 approval by GoI, it was agreed in principle that the State government would take over Phase-I Metro Rail project by taking over the debt of the project, which now stands at about Rs 13,000 cr. Further, the state government will pay about Rs 2,000 cr to L&T towards their equity investment in LTMRHL as a one-time settlement,"" PTI News reported citing people familiar with the development. The news report added that L&T had last month expressed interest in offloading its stake in the Metro Rail project citing operational and accumulated losses, following which the decision was taking in a meeting between Chief Minister A Revanth Reddy and senior officials with L&T group CMD S N Subrahmanyan. The Group had been exploring divestment options of non-core assets and various alternatives to de-risk exposure in L&T Metro Rail (Hyderabad). A consortium of 10 lenders, including State Bank of India has sanctioned the debt for the project. L&T Metro - Financials L&T Hyderabad Metro Rail's revenue from operations for FY25 was Rs 1,108.54 crore versus Rs 1,399.31 crore a year ago, a fall of 21 percent, with loss increasing by 13 percent on year, owing to delays and cost overrun. The SPV posted a loss of Rs 208 crore in Q1FY26 as compared to a loss of Rs 214 crore in Q1 FY25. . The EBITDA for Hyderabad metro was Rs 101 crore during Q1FY25 and stands at Rs 112 crore in Q1FY26. ""...at the current level of roughly Rs 12,500-odd crore of debt, the Hyderabad metro interest averages around Rs 240-250 crore,"" the company had said in the June quarter earnings call, which has resulted in a loss worth Rs 208 crore on L&T's books in Q1FY26. JM Financial in a note said it expects L&T to surpass its 18 percent target of RoE in FY26 once Hyderabad Metro losses end, and interest income adds up. About Hyderabad Metro The Hyderabad metro rail system comprises of three elevated corridors from Miyapur to LB Nagar, Jubilee Bus Station to Mahatma Gandhi Bus Station and Nagole to Raidurg, covering a total network of 69.2 km. The metro network was commissioned in phases, with the final stretch being commissioned in February 2020. In May 2025, the fare per passenger has been revised upwards on a net basis by 20 percent over existing fares. Other Recent Triggers L&T has recently announced a strategic partnership with BEL for the 5th-gen fighter (AMCA) programme, under which it will be submitting an Expression of Interest (EoI) for the project soon. The company is also working on semiconductor products that are expected to be released next year, with the CEO of unit, Sandeep Kumar, stating that the semiconductor arm will consider an IPO after crossing the $500 million mark in revenue, according to ICICI Direct."

Key highlights from the interaction are as follows: 1) the company holds ~6% market share in domestic cables & wires (C&W) and exports to over 74 countries (with Israel recently added to the list); 2) a higher share of in-house manufacturing for key raw materials drives strong backward integration; 3) it has planned capex of INR12.0b spread over the next three years to expand its cable capacity, supporting ~18% CAGR in C&W revenue during this period; and 4) better product mix (increase in cables share) and scale improvement are expected to expand margins. Outlook We estimate RRKABEL’s revenue/EBITDA/PAT CAGR at 15%/22%/19% over FY25- 28. We estimate its C&W segment margin at 7.8%/8.0%/8.2% in FY26/FY27/FY28 vs. 7.4% in FY25. We project the net debt (excluding acceptances) to increase to INR8.6b by FY28 vs. INR1.1b in FY25, led by higher capex. The stock is trading fairly at 36x/32x FY26E/27E EPS.

Carysil shares plunge up to 10% after Trump imposes 50% tariffs on kitchen equipment imports,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/carysil-shares-plunge-up-to-10-after-trump-imposes-50-tariffs-on-kitchen-equipment-imports-13582458.html,"The shares of Carysil plunged as much as 10 percent on September 26 after US President Donald Trump announced 50 percent tariff on imported kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, and a 30 percent tariff on upholstered furniture. The stock then made some recovery after the company clarified that the recent announcement doesn't include kitchen sink. Hence, it won't have any impact on the company. What does Carysil do? Carysil, which is known for manufacturing quartz kitchen sinks, is also known for its exports. Trump's latest announcement may have dampened investor sentiment, leading to the selloff. According to Carysil's Annual Report 2024-2025, 21.5 percent of its revenue came from the US market, while 17.7 percent came from India. The freshly announced tariffs will be effective from October 1. ""The reason for this is the large scale 'FLOODING' of these products into the United States by other outside Countries,"" Trump said. Carysil share price history: The shares of Carysil later recovered some losses to trade 5 percent lower at Rs 806.40 apiece. The stock has fallen nearly 12 percent in the past five days, but gained around 27 percent in the past six months. Its P/E ratio currently stands at nearly 34.

"Generic medicines exempted from Trump’s 100% pharma tariffs, but uncertainty continues",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/generic-medicines-exempted-from-trump-s-100-pharma-tariffs-but-uncertainty-continues-13581812.html,"Indian pharma exports, which are primarily low-cost generic or copycat medicines, may not be impacted by US President Donald Trump's latest announcement of 100 percent tariffs on “any branded or patented"" drugs imported into the US from October 1. While generic drugs are exempted, companies still face uncertainty over tariffs due to an investigation order by the US government under Section 232 to see whether pharma imports pose a threat to national security. ""The latest tariff announcement is for branded or patented drugs, and not applicable to generics,"" Sudarshan Jain, Secretary General, Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA), told Moneycontrol. IPA represents large homegrown pharmaceutical companies that have a significant exposure to the US market. Trump, however, said that exceptions would be made for pharmaceutical companies that are building manufacturing plants in the US or have broken ground to set up manufacturing plants. ""India, being an exporter of generic drugs, is unlikely to be impacted by this. But perhaps the president’s next target can be generic drugs. This decision may have a sentimental impact on pharmaceutical stocks,"" said VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited. Sun Pharma, India's largest drugmaker, which sells specialty branded drugs in the US, may have some impact. Specialty sales in the US rose 17.1 percent year-on-year, reaching $1.216 billion, and accounted for 19.7 percent of Sun Pharma’s consolidated revenues, up from 18 percent in FY24. Shares of Sun Pharma were down 1.79 percent and were trading at Rs 1,598.85 at 10 am on the BSE on September 26, while the BSE healthcare index declined 1.42 percent. Analysts say that generic medications play a critical role in keeping the costs of US healthcare system under check, giving them some shield against aggressive tariff actions. The US has, so far, withheld tariffs on generic medications, while levying it 50 percent on most of the other goods, which includes a 25 percent penal tariff for buying Russian oil. That said, the tariff threat isn't over for pharma companies as the Trump administration ordered investigation under the Section 232, launched by the US Department of Commerce, under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, to assess whether pharma imports pose a threat to national security. The investigation covers finished drugs, active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), key starting materials, and medical countermeasures. A final report is due by December 27, 2025, with a presidential decision expected by March 2026. Still, the threat of pharma-specific tariffs has prompted Indian firms to consider portfolio realignment and manufacturing shifts. Indian pharmaceutical executives are concerned that tariffs above 10 percent could make high-volume, low-margin products unviable, forcing them to cease supplies. India exported pharmaceuticals worth $8.73 billion to the US in 2024, accounting for 31 percent of its total pharma exports. Indian generics make up nearly half of all drugs covered by Medicare and commercial insurance plans, saving the US healthcare system $219 billion in 2022 alone. Lacks clarity It remains unclear whether Trump’s trade deals with the UK, Europe and Japan offer any protection to brand-name drugs imported to the US or would alter any terms of those deals. The US signed trade deals with the UK, Europe and Japan that imposes 10-15 percent tariffs on their exports. Nearly all of the biggest multinational drugmakers have a significant manufacturing presence in Europe, from where they exports drugs to the US. If branded and patented pharmaceuticals are not covered under the deal, it would have an impact not just on those companies, but may potentially squeeze margins for contract development and manufacturing organisations (CDMOs) which rely on them, offering R&D and manufacturing services for these companies. Analysts say despite Trump's push to boost local manufacturing, it's not easy to shift manufacturing to the US and get the plants rolling out drugs immediately. It can take 3–5 years or more to plan, construct, validate, and get regulatory approval for a new plant. It requires equipment procurement, workforce training, and supply chain setup."

Waaree Energies shares plunge 8% on US probe over suspected solar tariff evasion,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/waaree-energies-shares-plunge-6-on-us-probe-over-suspected-solar-tariff-evasion-13581954.html,"The shares of Waaree Energies dropped around 8 percent on September 26 after US customs officials said that they were investigating the Indian company over suspected tariff evasion. The shares hit an intraday low of Rs 3,198 apiece on Friday. All about US' tariff evasion probe: US customs officials cited by Reuters said they were investigating if the Indian solar company sidestepped US tariffs on Chinese-made cells and panels by labeling them as 'Made in India'. The American Alliance for Solar Manufacturing Trade Committee, a coalition of domestic solar manufacturers, had requested the investigation in letters to the agency earlier this year. The customs official informed attorneys for Waaree Energies and the coalition about the probe. In its memo quoted by Reuters, the agency said that there was reasonable suspicion that Waaree Energies didn’t label some of its imported products, which are subject to antidumping and countervailing duties imposed for years by America on solar cells and panels made in China and other Asian nations. It said it was taking steps to protect US revenues, such as requiring cash deposits from the company while the investigation is ongoing. What is the American Alliance for Solar Manufacturing Trade Committee? The American Alliance for Solar Manufacturing Trade Committee, which includes leading American solar module manufacturers like Qcells and First Solar, welcomed the probe. “Indian solar products have been among the lowest prices in the market, and now we know why that's possible: by using Chinese cells and not paying the duties that apply to them,"" Tim Brightbill, the group's attorney, said in a statement. ""Waaree has in the past co-operated with the US investigations and will continue to co-operate in ongoing investigations. We are a responsible corporate citizen in every country we operate in and we abide by all applicable local laws and regulations,"" the company said in an exchange filing. Waaree Energies share price history: Waaree Energies shares have dropped nearly 6 percent in the past five days, but gained more than 35 percent in the past six months. The stock is currently up nearly 15 percent in 2025 so far. Its P/E ratio currently stands at over 43. Yes Securities recently initiated a 'Buy' call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 4,610 apiece. This implies an upside potential of nearly 34 percent from the stock's previous closing price. Waaree Energies financials: The company in July reported an 89 percent increase in consolidated net profit at Rs 745 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2025. Its consolidated net profit was Rs 394 crore in the year-ago period. The firm's revenue from operations rose 30 percent to Rs 4,426 crore in Q1 FY26, as against Rs 3,409 crore in Q1FY25. Waaree Energies US operations: Waaree Energies has notable amount of operations in US. Earlier this year, the company had announced that it has started commercial production of solar modules at its manufacturing facility in US, becoming the first Indian renewable energy company to build a PV module manufacturing facility in Brookshire, Texas.

"Small, midcap indices extend losses to 5th straight day mirroring benchmarks; Waaree Energies, Natco Pharma decline up to 6%",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/nifty-small-midcap-indices-extend-losses-to-5th-straight-day-mirroring-benchmarks-waaree-energies-natco-pharma-decline-up-to-6-13581789.html,"The Nifty smallcap100 and midcap100 indices extended their losses for the fifth straight session on Friday, tracking weakness in the benchmark indices. The Nifty midcap index has fallen up to 3.2 percent over the past five sessions, while the smallcap gauge has declined around 4 percent. The broader trend mirrored the losses in the benchmark Sensex and Nifty, which have been on a downward run for six consecutive sessions. During this period, the Sensex has shed 2.73 percent, while the Nifty has slipped 2.52 percent. Analysts believe the correction in the Nifty Smallcap, midcap indices may be driven by profit booking and the unwinding of certain long positions. Ruchit Jain, Vice President, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, said ""this downmove just seems to be a correction within an uptrend and hence, it could result in a good opportunity for positional traders and investors. However, from a swing trading perspective it could be a difficult phase and hence one should tighten the risk management on the positions and wait for some signs of reversal."" In the smallcap segment, pharma counters bore the brunt after the US announced a 100 percent tariff on imports of branded or patented drugs from October 1. Only 13 of the 100 stocks on the Nifty Smallcap 100 index were in positive territory. Neuland Laboratories and Natco Pharma fell up to 4 percent in intraday trade. N ArunaGiri, Founder & CEO at TrustLine Holdings, added ""While benchmark indices like the Nifty may not see a decisive breakout soon, selective opportunities continue to emerge in small- and mid-cap stocks. The recent weakness in these segments has opened up attractive entry points for patient investors who focus on quality businesses. This is not a market for chasing the index; it’s a market that rewards thoughtful, selective stock picking in the broader space. We believe that this phase presents a constructive environment for long-term investors, particularly those willing to take a bottom-up approach in identifying fundamentally strong companies in the broader small and mid-cap space."" Pharma stocks fall up to 4% as Trump imposes 100% tariff on branded drugs Among midcaps, Waaree Energies was the top loser, declining up to 6 percent after US customs officials said that they were investigating the Indian company over suspected tariff evasion. Other prominent laggards included Premier Energies, Vodafone Idea, Biocon, Kalyan Jewellers India and Hindustan Zinc, which dropped up to 3 percent.

"Infosys, TechM, other shares fall up to 2% on Accenture's weak outlook: Nifty IT lower for a sixth session",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/infosys-techm-other-shares-fall-up-to-2-on-accenture-s-weak-outlook-nifty-it-lower-for-a-sixth-session-13581782.html,"Shares of leading IT companies were under selling pressure on September 26 after a weak outlook from Accenture dampened investor sentiment, taking the Nifty IT index lower by more than a percent, extending losses for a sixth session in a row. Accenture Expects Slower Growth While announcing results for the fourth quarter of the financial year 2025, consulting firm Accenture Plc said it expects US federal spending cuts on consultants to slow its growth next year, and sees a 1-1.5 percent impact on revenue from a slowdown in US federal business during the year through August 2026. Accenture also said it is laying off some employees as it pivots towards Artificial Intelligence. ""We are exiting, on a compressed timeline, people where reskilling based on our experience is not a viable path for the skills we need,"" Accenture CEO Julie Sweet told analysts during an earnings call. Recently, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) - India's largest IT services company - also announced layoffs of over 12,000 employees on similar grounds. Accenture Q4 Results Despite the grim outlook, Accenture reported better-than-expected results for Q4FY25. The consulting firm reported a revenue of $17.6 billion, higher than Bloomberg's consensus estimate of $17.4 billion. Accenture expects to clock in a revenue growth between 2-5 percent for the full-year 2026, slightly below estimates of 5.3 percent, according to data compiled by LSEG, as quoted by Reuters. Changes to H-1B visa policy are not likely to have a significant impact on Accenture's business, CEO said, adding that only about 5 percent of its US employees are employed on such visas. What Analysts Say Macquarie said the common takeaway from Accenture's announcements is that ""demand recovery is patchy as of now."" Goldman Sachs said that while the FY26 revenue growth expectations remain unchanged, the FY27 growth estimate for Indian IT firms could be at risk if discretionary demand shows no signs of improvement this year. Jefferies added that Accenture's muted growth guidance poses downside risks to consensus expectations of acceleration in growth in FY27 for Indian IT firms. Top IT Losers LTIMindtree (LTIM), Wipro and Infosys shares fell around 2 percent each, while Coforge, Tech Mahindra (TechM), Persistent Systems, HCL Tech and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) shares were down more than 1 percent each. Some of the leading IT stocks are down up to 30 percent in 2025 so far. Trump's Proposal President Donald Trump-led US administration has proposed to scrap the lottery system for H-1B visas and replace it with wage-based selection process. The new proposal by the Department of Homeland Security aims at bringing in ""a weighted selection process that would generally favour the allocation of H-1B visas to higher-skilled and higher-paid aliens, while maintaining the opportunity for employers to secure H-1B workers at all wage levels"". The new process, if finalised, would give more weight to applications by employers who pay high wages if annual requests for the visas exceed the statutory limit of 85,000, the notice said, as cited by Reuters. The move aims to better protect Americans from unfair wage competition from foreign workers. Also Read: Our LIVE blog on stock market updates US to Hike Fresh H-1B Application Fee Trump had recently announced that the US will introduce a $100,000 fee for fresh H-1B visa applications, an unprecedented increase from the earlier fee range of $215-5,000, depending on the company size. This move had earlier sent the IT stocks to a spin, after a brief rise following US Federal Reserve's rate cut. India was the largest beneficiary of H-1B visas last year, accounting for 71 percent of the approvals, while China was a distant second at 11.7 percent, according to US government data cited by Reuters.

Asia’s top defense stock DroneShield soars on military spending,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/asia-s-top-defense-stock-droneshield-soars-on-military-spending-13580802.html,"DroneShield Ltd. shares have nearly quintupled this year, outperforming Asian defense stocks as the Australian drone technology manufacturer rides a global wave of increased military budgets. The stock has jumped 380% in 2025, outpacing regional peers on a Bloomberg gauge focused on defense firms. A string of contract wins with governments in Australia, the US and Europe have boosted its shares, which joined Australia’s benchmark equity index earlier this month. The value of contracts received this year “is evidence of increased levels of consumer demand,” which the company is well placed to meet, said Bell Potter Securities Ltd. analyst Daniel Laing in a note last month. The growth of asymmetric warfare, including drones and counter-drones, is also central to the firm, he added. Defense stocks have rallied this year as ongoing conflicts and geopolitical tensions have spurred governments to ramp up spending. South Korea’s Hanwha Aerospace Co. has benefited from its experience in producing weapons for defeating Soviet-era systems, while Chinese defense manufacturers rose in the lead up to Beijing’s military parade in early September. DroneShield develops products to ward off drone attacks by tracking and disabling unmanned aircraft systems. Its stock surged in June after securing a package of European contracts worth A$61.6 million ($40.3 million), its largest order ever. The firm also recently won a package of two US Department of Defense contracts totaling A$7.9 million. In August, the company said its first-half revenue more than tripled from a year earlier. It attributed the increase to growth in regions beyond its key US market, including in Europe and the Asia Pacific. Still, some investors are skeptical of the stock’s surge. The firm’s “stretched” fundamentals at its A$3.2 billion market capitalization is one reason to be cautious, said Ben Richards, co-portfolio manager at Seneca Financial Solutions. DroneShield trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of roughly 70 times, a premium to Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index. Additionally, some directors have sold shares in the company during rallies, “which is a warning sign for us,” Richards added."

First Tick: Top global cues to watch in today’s trade,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/first-tick-top-global-cues-to-watch-in-today-s-trade-9-13578281.html,"Indian benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty are likely to open on a negative note on September 26, tracking GIFT Nifty, which was hovering around 24,896.50.

Here is how financial markets across the globe fared overnight: GIFT Nifty (Down) The GIFT Nifty is trading lower at around 24,896.50, indicating a negative start for the day. Asian Equities (Mixed) Asian stocks retreated after concerns about lofty valuations and mixed signals from Federal Reserve officials on rate cuts stalled a record-breaking rally on Wall Street. US Equities (Slip) US stocks ended moderately lower on Thursday, with most S&P 500 sectors down as economic data increased uncertainty over the outlook for interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 173.96 points, or 0.38%, to 45,947.32, the S&P 500 lost 33.25 points, or 0.50%, to 6,604.72 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 113.16 points, or 0.50%, to 22,384.70.

Crude (Gains) Oil prices edged up on Friday, on track to rise at their steepest rate since early June as Ukraine's attacks on Russia's energy infrastructure push Moscow to restrict fuel exports and close to cutting crude output.

"Asian shares decline, Trump tariffs spook pharma",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/asian-stocks-drop-after-wall-street-rally-stalls-13580744.html,"Asian stocks retreated after concerns about lofty valuations and mixed signals from Federal Reserve officials on rate cuts stalled a record-breaking rally on Wall Street. MSCI’s equity gauge for the region fell 0.3% with South Korean stocks leading the losses. That came after the S&P 500 dropped for a third session, the longest slide in a month. Daiichi Sankyo Co. and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. were among the losers after President Donald Trump proposed 100% levy on branded, patented pharma products. The dollar held its gains and the yen edged lower, hovering near the 150-a-dollar level. S&P 500 futures pared earlier gains to trade little changed after Trump announced a 25% tariff on truck imports from Oct. 1. After a $15 trillion rebound in global equities from April’s lows, traders now face a wall of uncertainty as tariff headlines return to weigh on markets. The Fed’s next policy move, a pivotal earnings season, and the threat of a US government shutdown are also weighing on sentiment. Attention now turns to Friday’s inflation report after the strong GDP data complicated the outlook for further easing after last week’s Fed rate cut. “This refreshed threat on pharma has been brought up by Trump several times as a negotiation tool,” said Anna Wu, cross-asset strategist at VanEck Associates Corp. in Sydney. “I expect this to weigh on the health care sector and broader sentiment in global equities, including Asian markets.” Short-end Treasury yields rose Thursday after data showed US gross domestic product grew at the fastest pace in nearly two years. Following the rally, the S&P 500’s 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio recently touched a high of 22.9, a level that this century was exceeded in just two prior instances: the dot-com bust and the pandemic rally in the summer of 2020 when the Fed reduced rates to near zero. “We agree that the economy is strong and growing,” said Chris Zaccarelli at Northlight Asset Management, “but a lot of that good news is already priced in. Where we have our largest concern is with valuations.” Money markets slightly reduced bets on rate cuts after the GDP data, projecting about 40 basis points of Fed reductions before the year is over. Divisions within the Fed over the path of rates added to the uncertainty. Fed Governor Stephen Miran said the US central bank risks damage to the economy by not moving rapidly to lower interest rates, dissenting against the decision to lower rates last week by a quarter percentage point, favoring a half-point cut. “I don’t think the economy is about to crater,” Miran said Thursday on Bloomberg Surveillance. But given the risks, “I would rather act proactively and lower rates as a result ahead of time, rather than wait for some giant catastrophe to occur,” he said. Michelle Bowman, the Fed’s top bank cop, said inflation is close enough to the central bank’s target to justify more rate cuts because the job market is weakening. Fed Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee expressed continued concern about tariff-driven inflation and pushed back against any call for “front-loading” multiple rate cuts. His Kansas City counterpart Jeff Schmid signaled the central bank may not need to cut again soon. Fed Bank of Dallas President Lorie Logan said the US central bank should abandon the federal funds rate as its benchmark in implementing monetary policy, and consider an overnight rate tied to the more robust market for loans collateralized by US Treasuries. Investors will turn their focus to Friday’s inflation data. The Fed’s preferred gauge of underlying inflation likely grew at a slower pace last month, offering policymakers some breathing room to address jobs cooling. A report on Friday is forecast to show the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy rose 0.2% in August, compared with 0.3% in July. On an annual basis, the so-called core measure is seen holding at a still-elevated 2.9%."
