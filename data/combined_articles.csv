Sell Tata Elxsi ; target of Rs 4750: Prabhudas Lilladher,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/sell-tata-elxsi-target-of-rs-4750-prabhudas-lilladher-13266213.html,"Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Tata Elxsi The revenue de-growth was in line with our estimates, largely attributed to M&C and H&L, while Transportation business reported flat QoQ CC vs -9.7% QoQ CC in Q4. The transportation business growth is negatively impacted by Tier-1 suppliers, otherwise the deal ramp ups on the Auto OEMs have improved of late and compensating the weakness against Tier-1. The management sounded optimistic to drive growth within Transportation from Q2, while M&C would recover from Q3 led by large deal ramp up. The timely ramp ups of the automotive deals and continued engagement with OEMs on the new-age offerings, give confidence to the management to drive growth within Transportation. However, the structural demand for M&C and H&L remains weak due to business consolidation and tariff impact on medical devices, leading to pullback on R&D and discretionary spending. The reported margins were below our estimates by 100bps due to lower employee utilization and continued investments for future growth. We are adjusting our margins by 110 and 130bps due to Q1 miss for FY26E/FY27E. Outlook We expect CC revenue to decline by 3.5% in FY26E and growth of 9.1% YoY in FY27E, while expect EBIT margin of 19.9% and 21.8% in FY26E and FY27E respectively. We are assigning 33x PE to FY27E, translating a TP of 4,750. Maintain SELL.

"Tesla's India showroom gets set for launch, M&M drags Nifty Auto index as competition hots up",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/tesla-s-india-showroom-gets-set-for-launch-m-m-drags-nifty-auto-index-as-competition-hots-up-13266161.html,"SUV maker M&M's shares are down nearly 2 percent in early trade on July 11, weighing on Nifty Auto index which is lower by 0.7 percent, as electric vehicle maker Tesla said it will be opening its first India showroom in Mumbai on July 15. The showroom will be called an 'experience center', said Tesla officials, bringing it closer to start selling its cars in India, which will be imported into the country. Shares of Bosch, a component supplier to Tesla, are higher by over 3 percent in the day's trade. Some of the other Indian suppliers to Tesla include names like Samvardhana Motherson International, Suprajit Engineering, Sona BLW Precision and Varroc Engineering. Amid a rising threat of additional tariffs by US President Trump, Moneycontrol on July 10 reported that Tesla has assured its Indian suppliers of continued procurement, irrespective of any levies. M&M Shares Sell Off Though under selling pressure in the share market on July 11, M&M emerged as the largest electric car and SUV player in Indian SUV segment in terms of revenue share during the March quarter, as per JATO data cited by the company. However, Tesla's entry is expected to intensify the competitive intensity in India's electric automotive space. In calendar year 2026, M&M has already announced plans to launch three ICE products, two born electric products, and two LCVs. On August 15, 2025, M&M has planned to reveal a new platform vision base, on which new products will start coming out from 2027. The SUV maker has opened up all markets - Tier I, II, even III, according to Rajesh Jejurikar, Automotive CEO at M&M, and is gradually increasing delivery of its EV offerings in all geographies. The booking momentum continues to be 'very steady and very strong', he said. ""...this is a business which we don't want to be rash and ramping up for two reasons. One is, there is a lot of product complexity. We are learning new technologies as we ramp up and so are our suppliers. So, we have to be very cautious in the way we ramp up production,"" Rajesh Jejurikar had said in May 2025. HDFC Securities in a note on July 11 said it sees softer demand for Indian auto market, both domestically and globally, which will impact volume growth. TVS Motors could benefit from its successful models and variants, including the EVs, while Mahindra & Mahindra has been seeing increasing traction for UVs and tractors. Tesla's India Plans To begin with, Tesla has imported fully-built cars, and is likely to start selling its Model Y in India, sourced from its Shanghai factory, China, Bloomberg News reported on June 20. Some news reports had said that five Model Y cars have are already in Mumbai at a 70% import duty. The Model Y is the world’s largest selling electric car. Tesla has also imported Supercharger components, accessories, merchandise and spares from US, China and the Netherlands, the report said. For Tesla, India's high import duties on cars have been a major hurdle in its expansion plans, given the high tariff and then the tax levied on the sale of the car, making its vehicles more expensive to begin with. ""..it would be a great market to enter because India has a big middle class, which we would want to tap in, and that is the market which we want to be in. But, again, these kind of things create a little bit of tension which we’re trying to work around,"" CFO Vaibhav Teneja had said during the Q12025 earnings call. Tesla has not yet named a replacement for its country head for India, after he resigned ahead of the planned entry into the world’s third-largest car market. The EV maker is reportedly also finalizing another showroom in Delhi's Aerocity, and has plans for an office in Bengaluru. Earlier this year, during PM Modi's US visit, Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk met the Prime Minister to discuss strengthening collaboration between Indian and US entities. Tesla's India foray comes after years of discussions over Musk's concerns around tariffs and New Delhi's demand for local manufacturing. EVs make up over 5% of India's passenger vehicle sales and premium cars are still less than 2% of the total car market, as per official data."
Buy Tata Consultancy Services; target of Rs 3920: Prabhudas Lilladher,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-tata-consultancy-services-target-of-rs-3920-prabhudas-lilladher-13266137.html,"Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Tata Consultancy Services The revenue growth in Q1 was disappointing, missing our estimates materially by ~200bps QoQ, largely attributed to the ramp down in BSNL deal (down 2.8% QoQ CC). The degree of weakness further intensified due to slowdown in international business down 0.5% QoQ CC, attributed to a softness in BFSI (down 0.5% QoQ CC). Despite concluding Q1 on a weaker trajectory, the management was confident of achieving better revenue growth in FY26 vs FY25, for international business. The tariff induced verticals already remained soft, the weakness in Europe BFSI further stalling the international business outlook, evident through weak Q1 deal TCV in BFS. We expect FY26 international growth largely to be flat CC, which translates to an ask-rate of ~0.6% CQGR, while we expect the BSNL add-on will support the growth in Q2/Q3 before it sees further ramp-down in Q4. On the margins, utilization and rationalizing employee pyramid are the major levers, however the low-margin add-on BSNL deal would continue to weigh on FY26 margins. We are adjusting our revenue estimates for the quarterly miss while keeping our margins broadly unchanged. Outlook We expect CC revenue to decline by 1.4% in FY26E followed by a growth of 5.3% in FY27E, while we expect margins to be reported at 24.6% and 25.1% in FY26E and FY27E. We assign 25x to FY27EPS that translates a TP of 3,920. Maintain BUY.

Mutual funds trump retail in Glenmark surge as cancer drug deal sends stock soaring,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/mutual-funds-trump-retail-in-glenmark-surge-as-cancer-drug-deal-sends-stock-soaring-13266106.html,"Mutual funds just beat retail shareholders hands down in Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, and the score wasn’t even close. After Glenmark’s landmark $2 billion licensing deal with US major AbbVie for its cancer drug, ISB 2001, the stock hit the 10% upper circuit on July 11. But the biggest winners weren’t retail investors — they were India’s top mutual funds that had steadily loaded up on the stock over the past two years. Data shows mutual fund ownership in Glenmark Pharma jumped from 9.1% in June 2023 to 14.6% in March 2025 — a clear signal of growing institutional conviction in the company’s innovation pipeline, even when public shareholders failed to fully price in its R&D potential. Promoters continue to hold a 46% stake, while FIIs remained steady at around 23%. Public shareholding, meanwhile, has declined from 20.4% to 15.56% during the same period, indicating that retail investors had been steadily exiting. The stock also had its share of marquee investors. Prashant Jain’s 3P India Equity Fund held just over 1% in Glenmark, while Ashish Dhawan held 1.77% in March 2025 in his personal capacity, although he pared his holding from 2.55% in September 2024. Among the fund houses that struck gold:-HDFC Mutual Fund was the most aggressive. Its Midcap Opportunities Fund held over 1.06 crore shares, while HDFC Manufacturing Fund and HDFC Balanced Advantage Fund also had sizable exposure, with 12 lakh and 8.85 lakh shares respectively.-UTI Value Fund (9 lakh shares), Bandhan Small-cap Fund (8.62 lakh), and Aditya Birla Sun Life Midcap Fund (7.01 lakh).-Mahindra Manulife Mutual Fund emerged as one of the top buyers in June. Its Multi Cap Fund added 8.45 lakh shares, and its Small Cap Fund disclosed another 3.6 lakh shares.-Invesco India Mid Cap Fund upped its stake by nearly 20%, picking up 2.74 lakh shares. FII activity in the stock remained mixed. Smallcap World Fund trimmed its stake from 4.84% in December 2023 to 3.21% in March 2025, while Norway’s Government Pension Fund Global maintained a 3.25% holding. Fund managers have clearly showed more faith in Glenmark’s R&D narrative than retail investors. The big institutional money rode on the belief that Glenmark’s innovation pipeline was undervalued — and this AbbVie licensing deal, with a $700 million upfront payout and $1.2 billion in milestones, proved them right."
"Hindustan Zinc jumps 1.5%: Silver at lifetime high, other key reasons behind stock surge",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/hindustan-zinc-jumps-1-5-silver-at-lifetime-high-other-key-reasons-behind-stock-surge-13265884.html,"The shares of Hindustan Zinc jumped over 1.5 percent on July 11 as prices of silver continued to rally. The Vedanta Group-owned company's shares were trading at Rs 430 apiece in the early trading hours. Silver's future contracts with September expiry opened at Rs 1.09 lakh per kg on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX). The prices then soared further to hit a lifetime high of over Rs Rs 1.11 lakh per kg. In the domestic markets, the price of one kilogram of silver gained Rs 1,000 in a single day to hover near Rs 1.11 lakh, according to data on Good Returns. Hindustan Zinc is the largest producer of silver in India, and produces refined silver with a minimum 99.9 percent purity. The sharp rise in the bullion's prices is expected to further boost the stock. Axis Securities remains bullish on silver prices, stating that the selloff in industrial metals was driving prices. Vedanta management denies 'Ponzi scheme' claims: The rise in the share price also comes after Vedanta Group denied 'Ponzi scheme' allegations levelled against it by American short-seller Viceroy Research. Vedanta Chairman Anil Agarwal told shareholders during its Annual General Meeting (AGM) on July 10 that the company has remained ""extremely transparent"". ""[The report] appears to be a motivated report, but we will address it,"" he added. He further outlined the company's growth prospects in the near future. ""Our 3D strategy, Demerger, Diversification and Deleveraging will enable us to double in size and unlock maximum value for our stakeholders… This is not just a story of growth, it is the story of realizing India’s aspirations. We are fully aligned with the needs of a developed Bharat,"" he said. Vedanta said that it has secured 10 critical mineral blocks across India, one of the largest by any private sector company. It is also setting up the world's first industrial Zinc Park and India's largest Aluminium Park, which is aimed at helping MSMEs and creating lakhs of employment opportunities. The positive outlook from the company's management may have also boosted the stock. Don't get distracted, says JPMorgan JPMorgan meanwhile said investors shouldn’t get distracted by the allegations, and it remains overweight on Vedanta. For Hindustan Zinc, the international brokerage said that the Indian government continues to maintain an active presence on its board, Mint reported. It added that government oversight continues to be effective, especially concerning capex planning. US-based short seller Viceroy Research on July 9 said that it has taken a short position on the debt of Vedanta Resources, saying that it resembles a 'Ponzi scheme'. It called the parent company of Vedanta a ""parasite holding company with no significant operations of its own, propped up entirely by cash extracted from its dying host, Vedanta Limited"". The American short-seller had alleged that Hindustan Zinc's resources are being ""looted"" through related-party deals with promoter-family owned companies and unjustifiable brand fees. ""Vedanta's crown jewel may be its biggest liability,"" it said while speaking about Hindustan Zinc.

In its fourth-quarter business update, Titan reported a 25 percent year-on-year increase in revenue across all its verticals. The company’s flagship jewellery segment witnessed a 25 percent growth compared to the same quarter last year. This was largely fueled by a significant uptick in gold prices.

Meanwhile, the watches and wearables division reported a 22 percent increase in revenue.

Asian Equities (Up) Asian stocks bounced back after the worst day on record, snapping a global slump sparked by concerns that President Donald Trump’s trade war will hurt economic growth. US Equities (Mixed) Most major stock indexes ended a turbulent Monday lower as U.S. President Donald Trump showed no sign of easing up on his global trade war, while US Treasury yields rebounded. The European Union proposed counter-tariffs on Monday, while Trump threatened to add another 50% duty on U.S. imports from China on Wednesday if it did not withdraw its 34% retaliatory tariffs from last week. US stocks swung between heavy losses and gains throughout the session as investors digested changing headlines related to tariffs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 349.26 points, or 0.91%, to 37,965.60; the S&P 500 dropped 11.83 points, or 0.23%, to 5,062.25; and the Nasdaq Composite rose 15.48 points, or 0.10%, to 15,603.26.

Asian currencies (Down) Asian currencies were trading mostly lower in the early Tuesday trade with the Indonesian Rupiah down the most followed by the China Renminbi, Malaysian Ringgit, Thai Baht, Taiwan Dollar Crude (Down) Oil prices rose more than 1% on Tuesday, rebounding after a hefty selloff in recent sessions led by concerns that U.S. tariffs might depress demand and lead to a global recession. Gold (Up) Gold was steady as fears that US President Donald Trump’s trade war could risk a global economic downturn drove haven demand, signaling a pause in the selloff of the asset in recent days. Fund Flow Action The Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) continued their selling on the sixth day on March 7, with selling equities worth Rs 9040 crore, however, Domestic institutional investors (DIIs) turned into net buyers as they bought equities of Rs 12122 crore on the same day.

"Dow, S&P 500 end wild session lower, Trump digs in on tariffs",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/dow-s-p-500-end-wild-session-lower-trump-digs-in-on-tariffs-12987990.html,"The S&P 500 and the Dow closed lower on Monday after a roller coaster session, with investors worried about an economic slowdown and rising inflation as U.S. President Donald Trump dug in his heels on tariffs, warning he could further increase levies on China. Wall Street equities have been hammered since Trump's sweeping tariffs, announced late Wednesday, on all imports into the U.S. and much higher levies on some major trading partners. Trading volume on Monday broke U.S. records for the second session in a row. In early trade, all three major U.S. indexes touched their lowest levels in more than a year. In the morning, they briefly rallied sharply on a report about tariffs, only to fall again after the report was knocked down. Also during the session, the CBOE Volatility Index, Wall Street's fear gauge, breached 60 points, hitting its highest level since August 2024. After paring gains it still ended the day at 46.98, its highest close in five years. ""The underlying problem of the market is that the administration's approach to trade imbalances is to try a cure that's worse than the disease,"" said Rick Meckler, partner, Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey. ""It's clear that investors favor either a pause or a different look at how to do this. It's very telling that of the many Trump supporters in the investment and business community, it doesn't look like there's anybody stepping up and endorsing the administration's approach to tariffs."" The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 349.26 points, or 0.91%, to 37,965.60, the S&P 500 lost 11.83 points, or 0.23%, to 5,062.25 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 15.48 points, or 0.10%, to 15,603.26. In the first two days following Trump's tariff announcements last week, the benchmark S&P 500 index had dived 10.5% and lost about $5 trillion in market value for its biggest two-day loss since March 2020. On Friday, the blue-chip Dow confirmed it was in a correction, or more than 10% below its December record close while the Nasdaq confirmed it was in a bear market, defined as a decline of 20% or more below its record close. In Monday morning trading, the S&P 500 had fallen 20% below its record closing high. The index briefly rallied more than 3%, after a news report said Trump was considering a 90-day pause on tariffs. White House officials quickly denied the report, sending the market back into the red. Meckler said the market's wild swings on Monday left investors ""a little bit concerned that if facts start to change, you could see a very rapid rise to this market."" ""It's leading to this back-and-forth movement of rallies that are effectively being sold and drops in the market where people are covering shorts or trying to find a place to buy."" Real estate lost 2.4%, the biggest percentage decliner among the S&P's 11 major industry indexes on Monday. Communications services, was the biggest gainer, finishing up 1%. Technology, adding 0.3%, was the only other sector to advance. In individual stocks, the S&P's biggest drags were Apple Inc, down 3.7%, and Tesla Inc which fell 2.6%. Its biggest boosts came from Nvidia, up more than 3%, and Amazon.com, which added 2.5%. Several speeches by Federal Reserve officials and a series of economic indicators, including consumer price data, are expected this week, with investors keenly watching out for any signs of a recession. Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4.45-to-1 ratio on the NYSE where there were 42 new highs and 2036 new lows. On the Nasdaq, 1,447 stocks rose and 3,070 fell as declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2.12-to-1 ratio. The S&P 500 posted no new 52-week highs and 168 new lows while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 10 new highs and 999 new lows. On U.S. exchanges, 29.13 billion shares changed hands, far exceeding the 17.13 billion average for the last 20 sessions. Friday's volume, of around 26.79 billion shares, beat the previous high of 24.48 billion shares traded on January 27, 2021."
"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bajaj Finance, GMR Airports, Chambal Fertilizers, PNB Housing, and others on April 8?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-kotak-mahindra-bank-bajaj-finance-gmr-airports-chambal-fertilizers-pnb-housing-and-others-on-april-8-12987972.html,"The benchmark indices nosedived sharply and closed with a 3 percent decline after recouping around 2 percent from the day's low, tracking tariff-led turmoil in global peers. The market breadth was dismal, with a total of 2,448 shares trapped in a bear market, compared to just 193 shares that outperformed. The trend is expected to remain favourable for bears, but some rebound can't be ruled out, considering the significant fall in the past few days. Below are some trading ideas for the near term: Jay Thakkar, Vice President & Head of Derivatives and Quant Research at ICICI Securities Kotak Mahindra Bank | CMP: Rs 2,037.85 Kotak Mahindra Bank has been one of the outperformers in the Nifty private sector banks, and the uptrend has been largely due to short covering. The stock has provided a breakout from a range lasting more than 3 years, which is quite significant. It is one of the few stocks in the current scenario trading near its all-time high levels, reflecting relative outperformance. Due to the heavy sell-off in the markets during the last trading session, the stock witnessed Put unwinding at almost all the strikes. However, it didn’t see much short addition from current levels; rather, the stock bounced back from lower levels. Based on these observations, the probability of the stock holding onto the Rs 2,000 levels—its second-highest Put open interest—is quite high, at least on a closing basis. Below that, there is another critical support level at Rs 1,960. Therefore, the risk-reward is favourable on the long side. So, buy Kotak Mahindra Bank in the range of Rs 2,000 to Rs 2,040. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,120, Rs 2,200 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,960 Bajaj Finance | CMP: Rs 8,568 Bajaj Finance has also witnessed a huge range breakout—a consolidation breakout lasting more than 3 years—and the short covering is still pending. Since the prices have fallen back to the level from where it broke upwards, there is a higher probability of short covering, as the stock has not seen a significant short build-up in the recent fall from the top. While there was Put unwinding at most strikes, additions were seen at the Rs 8,400 strike. Hence, the range of Rs 8,500 to Rs 8,400 is very critical in the near term, while Rs 9,000 is an immediate hurdle, making it the first target due to the highest Call open interest. So, buy Bajaj Finance in the range of Rs 8,550 to Rs 8,650. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 9,000, Rs 9,200 Stop-Loss: Rs 8,220 SRF | CMP: Rs 2,715.2 SRF has also outperformed the overall markets recently. There has been a breakout from a huge consolidation due to sharp short covering. Although some fresh short additions were seen in the recent fall, the prices have reversed from the breakout point, making the risk-reward favourable on the long side. The Rs 2,700 strike Put has the highest open interest, while the Rs 3,000 strike Call has the highest open interest. So, the range to watch is Rs 2,700 to Rs 3,000, and since the stock is near the lower end of the range, the bulls have a favourable chance from hereon. Buy SRF in the range of Rs 2,700 to Rs 2,650. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,900, Rs 3,000 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,550 Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi Zomato | CMP: Rs 209.63 Despite a sharp market-wide correction, Zomato outperformed, closing with only a marginal loss. The stock is forming multiple bottoms near the Rs 195 level, indicating strong support. Traders may consider entering long positions near Rs 205, with a stop-loss at Rs 195 and an upside target of Rs 225. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 225 Stop-Loss: Rs 195 GMR Airports | CMP: Rs 82.22 Unlike most F&O stocks, GMR Airports ended with gains in an otherwise volatile market. The stock witnessed a breakout above Rs 80, followed by a sharp pullback, and has now resumed its upward move. This price action suggests renewed strength and presents a potential buying opportunity. Traders may consider entering long positions near Rs 80, with a stop-loss at Rs 76 and an upside target of Rs 88. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 88 Stop-Loss: Rs 76 Anshul Jain, Head of Research at Lakshmishree Investments Chambal Fertilizers and Chemicals | CMP: Rs 612.8 Chambal Fertilizers, after breaking out of a rectangle pattern at Rs 546, offered no buying dips—until today. The stock has now smartly defended its 10–20 day moving average zone, giving short-term traders a golden entry into the momentum. Today’s bullish candle hints at renewed buying interest, supported by the cooling off of previously overheated momentum indicators. With the trend intact and structure strong, Chambal Fertilizers looks poised to clock fresh all-time highs in the coming sessions. Traders should watch for continued strength above support to ride the next leg up. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 700 Stop-Loss: Rs 580 PNB Housing Finance | CMP: Rs 923.65 PNB Housing Finance has defended its rounding bottom breakout impressively, even amid a falling market, with volumes consistently above the 50-day average, signaling strong institutional accumulation. For the bullish momentum to persist, the stock must hold above Rs 940. A sustained move above this level will likely lead to an initial target of Rs 1,050. The volume profile throughout the entire pattern reflects accumulation by strong hands, suggesting confidence in the stock’s long-term potential and positioning it as a frontrunner once market sentiment improves. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,050 Stop-Loss: Rs 880 Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

"Wall Street trades lower as Trump threatens China with steeper tariffs, markets near bear territory",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/wall-street-trades-lower-as-trump-threatens-china-with-steeper-tariffs-markets-near-bear-territory-12987885.html,"Wall Street's main indices continued to trade firmly lower albeit off lows as investors grappled with growing fears of a prolonged trade war and a White House unwilling to blink. Fears deepened as President Trump doubled down on his hardline trade stance, threatening even steeper tariffs on China — a move that escalated an already fraught standoff and pushed US markets closer to bear territory. Also read: India well poised to take advantage of current situation: Piyush Goyal on market upheaval from Trump's tariffs The S&P 500 shed 0.8 percent, now down nearly 20 percent from its February peak — the threshold that typically signals a bear market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 988 points, or 2.6 percent, following two historic 1,500-point declines last week. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.6 percent and is now 24 percent below its record high, with tech stocks once again leading losses. Markets saw a brief bounce at the open on hopes that the White House might consider delaying the sweeping tariff hikes that went into effect over the weekend. But that optimism was short-lived. The administration dismissed talk of a 90-day pause as “fake news,” triggering a sharp reversal. Over the weekend, Trump defended the policy, comparing it to ""medicine"" needed to fix systemic trade imbalances. On Monday, he issued a fresh warning to China on social media, threatening to slap a 50 percent tariff unless Beijing rolled back its retaliatory measures by April 8. Talks, he added, would be suspended if China failed to comply. Read more: Warburg expected to lead troubled MFI Fusion Finance’s rights issue Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed the hardline approach, telling CBS News: “The tariffs are coming... They are going to stay in place for days and weeks.” The sheer scale and speed of the tariff rollout has stunned investors. Rates have been applied across dozens of trade partners without the usual economic justifications. China, instead of seeking negotiations, retaliated immediately with a 34 percent levy on all US imports. With the administration showing little appetite for compromise, Wall Street is now pricing in a long, messy trade war. The market rout is also raising fears of forced selling, as funds scramble to raise cash to meet margin calls. The CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, spiked to 50 on Monday — a level typically associated with extreme market stress. The sell-off spilled into other asset classes. Bitcoin dropped below $77,000, oil prices fell under $60 a barrel, and volatility surged. European markets slumped for a fourth straight session on Monday, caught in the global equity rout sparked by President Trump’s aggressive new tariff regime. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index dropped as much as 6 percent before trimming losses to end 4.54 percent lower. France’s CAC 40 tumbled 4.8 percent, Germany’s DAX shed 4.26 percent, and the UK’s FTSE 100 declined 4.4 percent, as fears of an escalating trade war and a prolonged downturn continued to rattle investor nerves.

Every fresh development triggers a reaction, and the uncertainty has left sellers in an aggressive mood while buyers are hesitant to commit. ""It’s futile to predict how events will unfold,"" said Nilesh Shah, Managing Director of Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company. ""What investors can do is stick to their asset allocation dharma."" According to Shah, large-cap stocks are fairly valued and deserve a neutral allocation. But any correction should be seen as an opportunity. ""Buy gradually as markets turn cheaper. That’s how you position to be overweight equities,"" he advised. Amid the global noise, Shah believes domestic stories hold promise—especially sectors like cement, building materials, and consumer discretionary, which offer strong long-term potential. He pointed to several tailwinds supporting consumption: tax rebates announced in the budget, reduced EMI burdens thanks to falling interest rates, a likely dip in oil prices, and the expected rollout of the eighth pay commission next year. Indian equities witnessed a massive bloodbath in today's session. Dalal Street went into a freefall on April 7, as panic-selling took the benchmark indices sharply lower. Triggered by Donald Trump’s tariff tantrum on Wall Street, a wave of global jitters wiped out a jaw-dropping Rs 16 lakh crore in market value — the sharpest intraday collapse since June 2024. Inflation fears, a looming consumption crunch, and recession fears had investors running for cover as the Nifty and Sensex plunged deep into the red. India VIX — the fear gauge of the domestic market — soared as much as 66 percent to 22.85 on April 7, marking its sharpest intraday spike since June 4, 2024, according to Bloomberg data. The dramatic surge has completely erased the downtrend that had been in place since the latter half of January this year.

Meanwhile, domestic institutions stepped in with their heftiest buying since February 28, 2025—stacking up stocks worth Rs 12,122 crore. During the trading session of April 7, FIIs bought shares worth Rs 13,372 crore and sold shares worth Rs 22,412 crore. DIIs purchased shares worth Rs 26,528 crore and sold shares worth Rs 14,405 crore. For the year so far, FIIs have been net sellers of shares worth Rs 1.63 lakh crore, while DIIs have net bought Rs 1.96 lakh crore worth of shares. Market Performance Dalal Street went into a freefall on April 7, as panic-selling took the benchmark indices sharply lower. Triggered by Donald Trump’s tariff tantrum on Wall Street, a wave of global jitters wiped out a jaw-dropping Rs 16 lakh crore in market value — the sharpest intraday collapse since June 2024.

The dramatic surge has completely erased the downtrend that had been in place since the latter half of January this year. ""The primary reason behind the selloff is the fear of a full-blown global trade war and its potential to tip the world economy into a recession. Countries including China, Canada, and the European Union have spoken about retaliatory tariffs on American goods, and the uncertainty around whether a settlement can be reached before the next phase of tariff hikes is causing widespread nervousness,"" Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Research and Wealth Management said in a conversation with Moneycontrol. Khemka advised against panic selling or making adventurous bets. Instead, he recommended a disciplined, long-term approach. Investors should use the correction to gradually accumulate fundamentally strong, domestically focused companies, particularly in consumption, financials, and banks. These areas are better positioned to weather global headwinds compared to globally exposed sectors like IT, pharma, and metals.

"Bloodbath on Wall Street: S&P500 enters bear market, Dow Jones down 1,300 pts amid trade war fears",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/bloodbath-on-wall-street-s-p500-enters-bear-market-dow-jones-down-1-300-pts-amid-trade-war-fears-12987804.html,"U.S. stocks plunged for a third straight session on Monday, with investors reeling from the fallout of the Trump administration’s aggressive tariff measures that have triggered a global market rout and fears of a deepening trade war. Coming off a brutal week, Monday’s losses added to the wreckage across equity markets. The Dow has now shed more than 1,200 points to trade 3 percent lower for three straight sessions— a historic first — including a staggering 2,231-point tumble on Friday. The S&P 500 lost 6 percent on the last day of the previous week, its sharpest single-day decline since the COVID crash in March 2020, wiping out 10 percent in just two sessions. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq has officially entered bear market territory, now down over 22 percent from its all-time high. Investors had hoped the weekend would bring some signs of moderation or talks following President Trump’s abrupt imposition of 10 percent tariffs on nearly all key U.S. trade partners, which kicked in on Saturday. Instead, the White House struck a combative tone. ""I don’t want anything to go down, but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something,"" Trump said in a Sunday evening statement. ""We’re losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year to China. Until we fix that, there won’t be a deal."" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick reaffirmed the administration’s firm stance, stating that the tariffs were ""definitely going to stay in place for days and weeks,"" quashing any hopes of a near-term reversal. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent echoed the message, adding that while over 50 countries have approached the U.S. for talks, resolving the issue won’t be quick. Canada and the European Union are reportedly preparing countermeasures as well, signalling a broadening of the standoff. Wall Street now fears the selloff could spiral further, as hedge funds and institutional investors are forced to liquidate positions to meet mounting margin calls. The CBOE Volatility Index — Wall Street’s so-called fear gauge — shot up to 50 early Monday, a level rarely seen outside of major bear markets. The ripple effects were felt far beyond U.S. shores. Bitcoin crashed below $77,000, oil prices tumbled under $60 per barrel to multi-year lows, and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong nosedived 13 percent in its steepest drop since 1997. Germany’s DAX also sank, falling as much as 10 percent during Monday’s session. Among the hardest-hit U.S. stocks were high-profile names like Tesla, down 6 percent in early trade, along with Caterpillar — a global construction bellwether — which shed 5 percent. Apple also saw a sharp 4 percent drop. If the S&P 500 closes down 4 percent or more on Monday, it would mark the third consecutive day of such a steep decline — something that hasn’t happened since the depths of the Great Depression in 1933. With the administration showing no signs of backing down and retaliatory measures mounting, traders are bracing for more pain in the days ahead — unless diplomacy steps in to cool things off. As for Indian markets, Dalal Street went into a freefall on April 7, as panic-selling took the benchmark indices sharply lower. Triggered by Donald Trump’s tariff tantrum on Wall Street, a wave of global jitters wiped out a jaw-dropping Rs 16 lakh crore in market value — the sharpest intraday collapse since June 2024. Inflation fears, a looming consumption crunch, and recession fears had investors running for cover as the Nifty and Sensex plunged deep into the red. India VIX — the fear gauge of the domestic market — soared as much as 66 percent to 22.85 on April 7, marking its sharpest intraday spike since June 4, 2024, according to Bloomberg data. The dramatic surge has completely erased the downtrend that had been in place since the latter half of January this year.

All sectoral indices bore the brunt of the tariff tremors, with Nifty Metal and IT among the top laggards. ""Sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something,"" Trump said on his April 2 reciprocal tariffs that have since wiped trillions of dollars in company valuations. Hindustan PetroleumCrude-sensitive companies bounced back from day's lows after Brent oil price fell about 4% to $63 per barrel, its lowest since April 2021. HPCL had recovered from day’s low, but succumbed in late trade on Centre's announcement to hike excise duty. Britannia (up by 0.65% at closing) BritanniaShares of the FMCG major gained during the market mayhem, with Nifty FMCG index emerging as the least-impacted index, with 3 out of 15 constituents in the positive. The relative outperformance of FMCG is attributed to their consumer-facing nature, which provides cushion during market volatility. Trent (down by 14.77% at closing) TrentShares of Trent fell sharply by about 18% after the promoter of Zudio and Westside apparel chains announced a weak Q4FY25 business update, showing Q4FY25 revenue was lower than estimate. Bajaj Housing (down by 2.86% at closing) Bajaj HousingEven after strong provisional numbers for the March quarter, a bearish market sentiment pulled the shares of Bajaj Housing lower by 6% in trade. April is a key month for the company as the shareholder lock-in period comes to an end, and according to Nuvama, over 64 percent of Bajaj Housing Finance’s outstanding equity — about 529 crore shares — will become eligible for trade. Tata Group Tata GroupAll Tata Group stocks dipped as a part of the 'Black Monday' market crash. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Tata Steel, Tata Motors, Titan Company, Tata Consumer Products, and Trent, altogether witnessed Rs 1.28 lakh crore erosion in market capitalisation. Bharat Petroleum (down by 1% at closing) Bharat PetroleumShares of BPCL ended in the red with losses, however, the stock rebounded by nearly 5 percent from its day’s lows. The fall in Brent crude is expected to benefit oil marketing companies as the decline in crude prices would lower their input costs. Delhivery (down by 3.69% at closing) DelhiveryOwing to acquisition of Ecom Express, Delhivery shares defy general market sentiment and leap 4%. Estimates predict further upward movement. Delhivery has formally announced its decision to acquire a rival firm, Ecom Express Limited, for a total sum of Rs 1,407 crore. Mazagaon (down by 8.39%) Mazagon Dock ShipbuildersThe shares of Mazagon crashed nearly 10 percent, marking a downgrade for a third continuous session, fuelled by government's plans to sell up to 4.83 percent stake in the PSU defence firm. Kotak Bank (down by 4.41% at closing) Nifty Bank indexThe banking index ended down more than 3 percent following US President Trump's slew of tariffs on multiple countries.

"Glenmark’s R&D bet pays off handsomely with AbbVie deal, vindicating backer-in-chief Saldanha",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/glenmark-s-r-d-bet-pays-off-handsomely-with-abbvie-deal-vindicating-backer-in-chief-saldanha-13261705.html,"Glenmark Pharmaceuticals chairman and managing director Glenn Saldanha has secured one of the largest global licensing deals for an Indian-origin biotech asset, a high-risk bet that not only proved naysayers wrong but also seems to have paid off really well. ISB 2001, a cancer treatment developed by Glenmark’s US-based subsidiary Ichnos Glenmark Innovation has been licensed to AbbVie for $700 million upfront. IGI could earn up to $1.225 billion in additional milestone payments, according to the agreement, which needs regulatory approvals. “This is not just a Glenmark moment — it’s an India moment,” Saldanha told media on July 10 evening following the deal announcement. “We’ve gone through blood, sweat, and tears to get here. This validates everything we’ve built,” he said. Just a year ago, the company had to sell some assets to pare debt and clean up its balance sheet. Its cash-heavy model didn’t sit too well with investors either. And then ISB 2001 happened. ISB 2001 targets relapsing multiple myeloma, a form of blood cancer that affects white blood cells. The drug has the potential to address a significant unmet need, especially in cases where patients have exhausted other lines of treatment. It is estimated that globally between 200,000 and 300,000 patients suffer from multiple myeloma. The milestone payments hinge on successful clinical trials such as completion of Phase 1, 2, and Phase 3, regulatory nods and commercial outcomes such as launches in specific markets, sales thresholds or market share. Globally, the ISB 2001 deal ranks third-largest in terms of upfront payment size for a multi-specific or bispecific asset in the last two years, placing it in elite company alongside two agreements involving China’s 3SBio licensing its PD-1 asset to Pfizer for $1.25 billion, with milestone payments potentially reaching $4.8 billion plus royalties on sales. The other is BioNTech – BMS licensing deal worth $11.1 billion, including upfront and milestone payments. High risk, high cash burn Glenmark's high-risk, high-cash-burn research and development model didn't resonate well with most Indian investors and analysts. The Mumbai-based firm has an impressive track record of building brands domestically and has a sizeable presence in the US and Europe. Nine of its brands, including Candid, Ascoril, and Telma, are among the top 300 in India by sales but the company has struggled with high debt and sub-20 EBITDA margins, way below the industry standard. It had to sell some good assets, including its API business to Nirma in March 2024, which allowed the company to clean up the balance sheet, lowering the net debt to around Rs 400 crore. ""The challenge with India has always been that the capital markets are always short-term focused. So, there's always pressure on showing higher margins, getting better valuation, getting better market cap. And that's contrary to spending in innovation.” Saldanha said. “Innovation is the long gestation period capital that you're putting aside every year, with a view that something will culminate down the road.” What’s different this time? ISB 2001, developed using IGI’s proprietary BEAT multispecific antibody platform, targets BCMA and CD38 on myeloma cells and CD3 on T cells. It showed a 79 percent overall response rate and 30 percent complete response in heavily pre-treated multiple myeloma patients in Phase 1 trials, earning Orphan Drug Designation and Fast Track status from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Unlike previous efforts, Glenmark focused its resources on a single, high-potential asset. “We shut down other programmes and bet big on ISB 2001,” said Saldanha. “All it takes is one asset to transform a company — just look at Keytruda.” He was referring to American drug firm Merck’s Keytruda (pembrolizumab), which is the top selling cancer drug globally, generating $29.5 billion in sales in 2024 alone. Behind the scenes The work on licensing deal between IGI and AbbVie for ISB 2001 began in earnest in January 2025 during the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference — the global event for biotech dealmaking. Following the presentation of promising Phase 1 data at American Society of Hematology (ASH) in late 2024, IGI scouting for potential partners. Compelling clinical data — a 79 percent overall response rate and 30 percent complete response —sparked interest among several global pharma companies. Negotiations with AbbVie intensified after the ASCO 2025 presentation, which further validated ISB 2001’s efficacy and safety profile. Over the next six months, IGI and AbbVie engaged in rigorous due diligence, contracting, and strategic discussions, culminating into licensing deal. What next? AbbVie will now lead global development and commercialisation in North America, Europe, Japan, and Greater China. Glenmark retains rights for Emerging Markets, including India, Latin America, and Africa. The molecule remains in Phase 1 dose expansion, with commercialisation expected in four to five years, subject to regulatory progress. Glenmark will remain deeply involved through joint committees and retain commercial rights in key geographies, Saldanha said. “It’s a partnership not a hands-off,” he said. The Rs 6,000 crore upfront payment will make IGI self-funded for at least three years, reducing pressure to launch IPO immediately. “We’ll time the IGI IPO based on market conditions,” Saldanha noted. “But we’re now debt-free and have the flexibility to reward shareholders.” While no acquisitions are planned yet, Glenmark will continue investing in innovation. “We’re not stepping away from R&D. We’ll do globally relevant work,” he said. Beyond ISB 2001 IGI’s pipeline includes ISB 2301, another multi-specific antibody targeting NK cells, which is expected to enter clinical trials next year. Two monoclonal antibody programmes in dermatology are also partnered and progressing. “We’re building a portfolio, not just a one-hit wonder,” said Saldanha. “We’ve always believed in moving up the value chain,” said Saldanha. “This is just the beginning.”"
A $2 billion shot in the arm: Why Glenmark’s AbbVie deal could trigger rerating,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/a-2-billion-shot-in-the-arm-why-glenmark-s-abbvie-deal-could-trigger-rerating-13264819.html,"Glenmark Pharmaceuticals may have just triggered a reset in how Indian pharma innovation is valued. On July 10, its Swiss-based innovation arm IGI Therapeutics SA announced a landmark global licensing deal with US major AbbVie for its lead investigational molecule ISB 2001, currently in Phase 1. The deal — a first of its kind in scale for a domestic biotech player — includes a $700 million (Rs 6,000 crore) upfront payment, up to $1.2 billion in milestone payouts, and tiered double-digit royalties. If the drug succeeds, Glenmark could be staring at a royalty stream larger than its current EBITDA — a leap that investors and analysts say could not only de-risk the balance sheet but also re-rate the innovation story that Glenmark has long tried to build. “With $2 billion in deal value and double-digit royalties, AbbVie’s implied peak sales estimate for this molecule is likely $5 to 6 billion,” said Vishal Manchanda, pharma analyst at Systematix. “If the drug delivers, Glenmark could earn over $500 million in annual royalties — more than its current consolidated EBITDA,” he added. Manchanda also pointed out that the size of the deal for a Phase 1 molecule is materially large, even by global standards. He expects commercialisation in about three years, and peak sales in six to seven. Glenmark won't chase IPO cash — for now As per management comments in the post-deal briefing, Glenmark sees no urgency for an IPO of IGI, a step it had previously planned to fund its high R&D burn. Instead, IGI — which needs about $70 million annually for R&D over the next three years — plans to retain the upfront cash, pay a small dividend to Glenmark, and not deleverage materially, given the limited debt on its books. That pivot makes this one of the most meaningful pre-IPO de-risking moves in Indian pharma’s recent past. “This makes the IGI platform self-sustaining,” said Vineet Gala, an independent pharma analyst. “For years, Glenmark was funding it through leverage and internal cash flows. This removes that pressure, and shifts the story from 'R\&D on debt' to a monetizable innovation pipeline,” he added. Gala added that Glenmark has at least two to three more molecules in development, and may still explore a private equity partner or fundraising event at a later stage. “But for now, they have a long runway,” he said. What changes now? The strategic implication of the deal goes beyond the headline numbers. “This is de-risking on all fronts — balance sheet, innovation funding, even IPO timelines,” Gala said, “The innovation engine is finally capitalised.” Glenmark’s intangibles had ballooned to Rs 4,000 to 4,500 crore over the last two years, with most of it parked in IGI’s pipeline. With the licensing of ISB 2001 — a T-cell engager targeting solid tumors — Glenmark has created a blueprint for capital-light R&D in India, similar to SPARC or China-origin biotech platforms. The street has already started to price that in. The stock closed nearly 5% higher on July 10, and analysts say the medium-term trajectory remains positive. “The company has run up in anticipation, but there’s still more room if the innovation roadmap becomes credible,” said Gala. With an Analyst Day scheduled for July 16, more colour on the pipeline is expected. And for Glenmark, this could mark a turning point — not just in valuation, but in trust from public markets around its innovation thesis."
"Sensex, Nifty eye weak start as Trump tariff jitters resurface; key levels to track on July 11",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sensex-nifty-eye-weak-start-as-trump-tariff-jitters-resurface-key-levels-to-track-on-july-11-13264639.html,"Benchmark indices Nifty and Sensex are set for a weak start on July 11, likely extending their losing streak to a third straight session, after fresh tariff threats from US President Donald Trump rattled global sentiment. Trump announced a 35 percent tariff on Canadian imports starting August 1 and hinted at blanket duties of 15 to 20 percent on most trade partners, reigniting fears of a global trade war. At approximately 7:55 a.m., the GIFT Nifty was trading at 25,283, down 127 points or 0.5 per cent. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates In the previous session, equity indices were weighed down by heightened volatility typical of the weekly derivatives expiry. On the sectoral front, the Nifty IT index emerged as the biggest drag, with heavyweights such as Infosys, Wipro, TCS, and Tech Mahindra slipping. Analysts warned that the IT sector may witness a tepid earnings season. On July 10, both Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) and domestic institutional investors (DIIs) were net buyers. DIIs net bought Rs 221 crore in Indian equities while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) net bought Rs 591 crore, according to provisional data on NSE. Here are the key levels to watch out for in today's session The 25,300 level is now a crucial make-or-break point; a sustained close below this could further weaken the chart structure. On the flip side, the 25,550–25,600 zone continues to attract selling pressure, marking a critical resistance area that needs to be crossed for any sustainable up move. Additionally, Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) are aggressively increasing their short positions in index futures, indicating caution from institutional participants. Until there's evidence of short covering or long buildup by FPIs, upside momentum is expected to remain limited. ""A firm hurdle has formed near 57,350, where selling pressure has repeatedly emerged. Unless the index closes above this resistance zone, a sustained bullish reversal appears unlikely,"" says Dhupesh Dhameja of SAMCO Securities. ""Price action remains indecisive, oscillating between the 10-day and 20-day EMAs. The index continues to consolidate within a narrow 500-point band (56,800–57,300), with muted institutional participation. A close below the key support at 56,770 could weaken the structure further, while a sustained move above 57,350 is needed to signal strength. Adding to the cautious outlook, FPIs have been consistently short on index futures, pointing to persistent supply pressure at higher levels,"" he added. India VIX slipped 2.24 percent to close at 11.67, remaining well below the psychological mark of 15. This low-volatility regime points to muted investor fear and favours a slow, grinding market rather than volatile price swings. However, it also reflects indecision and a lack of strong directional conviction. The Put-Call Ratio (PCR) remained steady at 0.69, underscoring a bearish tilt due to elevated call writing.

A total of 1,443 shares saw a correction compared to 1,196 shares that gained on the NSE. The market is expected to see further consolidation with a negative bias in the upcoming sessions. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Mandar Bhojane, Senior Equity Research Analyst at Choice Broking Prestige Estates Projects | CMP: Rs 1,696.5 Prestige Estates Projects has recently formed a Cup and Handle pattern on the daily chart with strong volume participation, indicating rising bullish interest. A decisive close above Rs 1,750 would confirm the pattern breakout and could open up a fresh upside rally. The immediate support is placed at Rs 1,640, making it a strong accumulation zone for traders looking to enter on dips. The RSI stands at 61.15 and is trending upward, reflecting improving momentum and increasing buying pressure. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,000, Rs 2,100 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,580 Sterling and Wilson Renewable Energy | CMP: Rs 336.55 Sterling and Wilson Renewable Energy saw a decisive breakout from a Cup and Handle formation on the daily chart. The move, backed by a noticeable rise in volumes, suggests that bulls are regaining control and a trend shift may already be underway. Momentum is building, with the RSI at 65.9, trending upward and reflecting growing strength without entering overbought territory. The Rs 320 level stands out as a strong base and could act as a buy-on-dips zone. With the price holding above the breakout zone, sustained momentum could lead to targets of Rs 400 and Rs 420 in the short term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 400, Rs 420 Stop-Loss: Rs 310 Jay Mehta, Technical Research at JM Financial Services IndiaMart InterMesh | CMP: Rs 2,586.2 IndiaMart InterMesh has formed an inverse Head-and-Shoulders pattern on the daily chart—a bullish reversal pattern—and it has already given a breakout above the pattern. On June 25, the stock formed a bullish gap, and it is currently retesting this gap while finding support at the 20-day EMA, indicating potential for a continuation of the upward trend. A move above Rs 2,661 could accelerate the bullish momentum. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,750, Rs 2,980 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,387 Ingersoll Rand (India) | CMP: Rs 4,178.9 Ingersoll Rand (India) has broken above a trendline resistance in place since the high of November 26, 2024. After three unsuccessful attempts this week, marked by consolidative spinning top candlestick patterns, it achieved a breakout today with positive volume confirmation, signaling potential for further upside. Momentum indicators are exhibiting strong bullish strength. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 4,350, Rs 4,450 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,990 JSW Energy | CMP: Rs 530.55 JSW Energy has broken out of a triangular consolidation pattern on the daily chart, accompanied by a surge in positive volume. The stock has found support near its 20-day and 50-day EMAs, confirming bullish strength. A move above Rs 545 could further fuel the upward momentum. The momentum indicator is in a bullish zone, with a positive crossover signaling growing bullish strength. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 578, Rs 600 Stop-Loss: Rs 509 Dhupesh Dhameja, Derivatives Research Analyst at Samco Securities Premier Energies | CMP: Rs 1,115.8 Premier Energies is on the verge of a breakout from a classic Cup and Handle formation, signaling a potential reversal of its prior downtrend and laying the groundwork for the next leg of upward momentum. The pattern is accompanied by a notable surge in volumes, confirming the breakout. Interestingly, volume participation remained muted during the pattern formation—an ideal setup often seen before a sharp price-volume expansion—which now reflects renewed investor interest. The stock is trading firmly above its 20-day EMA, and the daily RSI has climbed above 60, reinforcing the bullish momentum. These technical indicators suggest growing strength and support the likelihood of a sustained rally. Traders may consider initiating long positions at the current market price or on dips toward Rs 1,105. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,255 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,030 EID Parry India | CMP: Rs 1,109.8 EID Parry India is displaying impressive relative strength, outperforming the benchmark index and trading near its record high. The stock has confirmed a breakout from a classic Flag and Pole continuation pattern, signaling the potential for a further rally into uncharted territory. The breakout is validated by a sharp surge in trading volumes following a period of subdued activity during the pattern formation—an ideal setup that often precedes significant price expansion. This volume-price action suggests renewed buying interest and strengthening bullish sentiment. Technically, the stock is comfortably trading above its upward-sloping 20-day EMA, while the daily RSI continues to hold above the 60 mark, reinforcing the ongoing momentum and increasing the probability of sustained upside. Traders may consider entering long positions at the current market price or on dips toward Rs 1,095. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,200 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,054 Adani Power | CMP: Rs 605.8 Adani Power has decisively broken out of an ascending triangle pattern, marking a key technical shift as the stock exits its accumulation phase and trades well above its neckline. This breakout also signals early signs of a reversal from its prolonged downtrend, suggesting the potential beginning of a fresh markup phase. The move is backed by a notable surge in trading volumes, following a period of subdued participation during the pattern formation—a classic setup that often precedes sharp price expansion. The strong volume confirms renewed buying interest and builds a solid foundation for sustained upward momentum. From a technical perspective, the daily RSI has sustained above the 60 mark for the first time in nearly a year, further validating the bullish reversal and increasing confidence in a continued rally. The stock is now well-positioned for a strong uptrend in the sessions ahead. Traders may consider initiating long positions at the current market price or on dips toward Rs 598. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 680 Stop-Loss: Rs 560 Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

SEBI fines Aqua Proof Rs 45 lakh for front-running KPIT Tech trades,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sebi-fines-aqua-proof-rs-45-lakh-for-front-running-kpit-tech-trades-13261169.html,"The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has penalised Aqua Proof Wall Plast Private Limited (APWPPL) and its director Naresh Chandra Bohra for front-running trades in the shares of KPIT Technologies Ltd. SEBI has imposed a fine of Rs 40 lakh on APWPPL and Rs 5 lakh on Bohra for the violation. The regulator found that APWPPL made illegal gains of Rs 19.52 lakh in 2017 by executing trades ahead of a large client’s order, a practice known as front-running, which is banned in India. SEBI did not estimate the exact investor losses but warned that such activity distorts market prices, erodes investor trust, and causes financial harm to large clients who get poorer execution rates. The trades in question were originally done by Mehrangarh Financial Advisors Pvt Ltd (MFAPL), which later merged with APWPPL. The firm allegedly traded KPIT Technologies shares on July 26, 2017, based on non-public client information accessed through Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers. Here’s how it played out: MFAPL sold shares at around Rs 123.73, just before the big client placed its sell order. As soon as the client’s order hit the market and prices dropped, MFAPL bought the shares back at around Rs 120.20. The company made a profit of Rs 3.53 per share on 5.52 lakh shares in a single day. SEBI concluded that the firm had used privileged information to gain an unfair advantage in the market.

At close, the Sensex was down 345.80 points or 0.41 percent at 83,190.28, and the Nifty was down 120.85 points or 0.47 percent at 25,355.25. Nifty Midcap and smallcap indices shed 0.3 percent each. Except metal, realty, all other indices ended lower with pharma, telecom, IT, PSU Bank, FMCG down 0.5 percent each. IT stocks were cautious ahead of TCS Q1 results. Bharti Airtel, HDFC Life, Asian Paints, Apollo Hospitals, Shriram Finance were among major losers on the Nifty, while gainers were IndusInd Bank, Maruti Suzuki, Tata Steel, Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv.

Click to View More Outlook for July 11 Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities Nifty slipped lower following a breakdown from the congestion zone on the daily chart, reinforcing the prevailing bearish sentiment. Additionally, the index has moved below the 21-hour exponential moving average. The RSI (14) on the daily chart has also turned negative, indicating weakening momentum. In the short term, the trend is likely to remain weak, which could lead to further downside. On the lower end, support is placed at 25,250–25,200, while on the higher end, resistance levels are seen at 25,400 and 25,500. Aditya Gaggar Director of Progressive Shares Today's trade was dominated by bears. After a muted start, the market witnessed a one-sided move toward the south, ultimately ending the session at 25,355.25 with a notable loss of 120.85 points. Except for the Realty and Metal, all other sectors closed in negative territory, with IT and PSU Banking being the major laggards. The broader markets outperformed the Frontline Index, as the Midcap and Smallcap segments managed to restrict their corrections. Over the past few sessions, the level of 25,400 had acted as a strong support; however, it was breached in today’s trade, though a confirmatory move is required. If the downward momentum continues, the correction could extend further toward the 25,200 mark, while resistance is now seen lower at 25,520. Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets edged lower and lost nearly half a percent on the weekly expiry day. After a flat start, the Nifty gradually drifted lower as the session progressed and finally settled near the day’s low, around the 25,355.25 mark. On the sectoral front, profit booking in IT majors ahead of TCS results weighed on the index, followed closely by weakness in FMCG and pharma stocks. However, the realty and metal sectors bucked the trend and closed in the green. The broader indices also ended with modest losses, continuing their profit-taking phase. Markets will react to TCS’s earnings in early trade, with a keen eye on management commentary, which could set the initial tone. With the Nifty now hovering near its immediate and crucial support zone—marked by the 20-day exponential moving average (20-DEMA) and the upper boundary of its previous consolidation range around the 25,200–25,300 zone—it will be critical for the index to hold this level to maintain its positive bias. That said, with the earnings season underway, stock-specific opportunities are likely to emerge on both sides, so participants should align their positions accordingly.

"Sensex, Nifty slide for second day amid expiry-day jitters; all eyes on TCS Q1",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sensex-nifty-slide-for-second-day-amid-expiry-day-jitters-all-eyes-on-tcs-q1-13258818.html,"Nifty extended its losing streak for the second straight session on July 10, weighed down by heightened volatility typical of the weekly derivatives expiry. The subdued mood also reflected a lack of fresh triggers, as investors awaited the start of the June-quarter earnings season with TCS’s results and monitored progress on the long-pending India–US trade deal. At the close, the Sensex was down 345.80 points or 0.41 percent at 83,190.28, and the Nifty was down 120.85 points or 0.47 percent at 25,355.25. About 1919 shares advanced, 1947 shares declined, and 140 shares remained unchanged. Also read: Merchant bankers are gearing up for a ‘beauty parade’ in anticipation of NSE’s IPO On the sectoral front, Nifty IT emerged as the biggest drag, with heavyweights like Infosys, Wipro, TCS, and Tech Mahindra slipping. Analysts warned that the IT sector may witness a tepid earnings season, hurt by global macroeconomic uncertainties. Brokerage Equirius Capital expects TCS’s US revenues to decline sequentially by about 0.4 percent in constant currency terms for the quarter, citing headwinds from the ramp-down of the BSNL deal and weaker international sales growth. Nifty PSU Bank index was also one of the worst performers, falling 0.77 percent, followed by Nifty IT and Nifty Pharma, which declined 0.82 percent and 0.59 percent, respectively. Nifty Bank and Nifty FMCG also slipped 0.41 percent and 0.55 percent. On the broader front, the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices dropped 0.29 percent and 0.28 percent, respectively.

Volatility remained subdued as India VIX declined over 2 percent to 11.68. Looking ahead, Manish Sonthalia, Director & CIO at Emkay Investment Managers, maintained a positive medium-term view despite near-term volatility, describing it as “unequivocally a buy-on-dips market.” “I believe investors who buy into this dip will benefit from tailwinds expected in Q3 and Q4. We see Nifty 50 earnings growth in Q1FY26 at around 3–8 percent. While markets could overshoot on the upside, this volatility is an opportunity to accumulate select stocks,” he said. On the technical side, Vaishali Parekh, VP – Technical Research at Prabhudas Lilladher Capital, noted that volatility could intensify as the results season unfolds. “The index has strong support in the 25,250–25,300 zone, which needs to hold. On the upside, a decisive break above 25,650 could trigger a fresh rally, opening the path to targets of 25,700 and 26,200 in the coming sessions,” she added. Maruti Suzuki, IndusInd Bank, Tata Steel, Bajaj Finance, and Bajaj Finserv were the top gainers on the Nifty. Laggards on the index included Bharti Airtel, Asian Paints, HDFC Life, Apollo Hospitals, and Shriram Finance.

"IPO-bound Anthem Bio says cost arbitrage drove expansion, proposing China alternative for global pharma",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/ipo-bound-anthem-bio-says-cost-arbitrage-drove-expansion-proposing-china-alternate-for-global-pharma-13257667.html,"IPO-bound Anthem Biosciences, a Bengaluru-based contract research development and manufacturing firm (CRDMO), will be the second such player to debut on stock exchanges in less than a year, and has positioned itself as a key alternative to global biotech and pharma majors in diversifying their supply chains. The management told Moneycontrol that it is now the second source for many Chinese products, and one of the fastest-growing CRDMOs in India. “We’re now the second source for many products made in China, and the first choice for new ones,” Ajay Bhardwaj, CEO and Founder of Anthem told Moneycontrol in an interview. Anthem’s IPO, opening on July 14, is a pure offer-for-sale of Rs 3,395 crore in which the private equity investor True North will be offloading shares along with promoters trimming stakes slightly. Post-listing, promoter holding will remain above 74%. In December, Hyderabad-based Sai Life Sciences had completed a successful IPO - oversubscribed more than ten times - with institutional investors showing strong interest, betting on the sector's tailwinds. Since then, Sai Life has gained around 19% from its listing price of Rs 660 per share to trade near Rs 784.90 on BSE on July 10. The supply chain diversification by global pharma, in addition to India’s scientific capabilities and cost arbitrage, made Anthem the fastest-growing CRDMO with revenue growing at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 24.8% and EBITDA growth of almost 30% in the last five financial years. The company ended FY25 with revenue of Rs 1844.6 crore and an EBITDA margin of 36.8%. Among CRDMOs, Divi’s Laboratories led the pack with revenue of Rs 9,360 crore, and an EBITDA margin of 31.7% with a net profit of Rs 2,191 crore in FY25. Divi’s was followed by Syngene International with a revenue of Rs 3,642 crore, EBITDA margin of 29% and a net profit of Rs 496 crore. Sai Life Sciences recorded revenue of Rs 1,642 crore, an EBITDA margin of 24%, and net profit of Rs 173 crore and Cohance Lifesciences posted revenue of Rs 1,198 crore, an EBITDA margin of 31.3%, and net profit of Rs 265 crore. Divi’s and Cohance’s revenues also comes from active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) manufacturing, along with CDMO. How Did it all Start? Anthem Biosciences began its journey in 2006, with Ajay Bhardwaj, Ganesh Sambasivam, and K Ravindra Chandrappa as founders, who were all colleagues at Biocon and its subsidiary Syngene. Bhardwaj, while leaving Biocon in 2006, had a chance conversation with Dinesh (a colleague from Syngene) which sparked the idea of starting a company. Bhardwaj recollects their vision was to build a ‘company that does things differently, instead of replicating products or clients’ from previous pharma employers.""We targetted small biotech firms that were under-served by larger CRDMOs, offering a fee-for-service (FFS) model - where clients pay only upon delivery - rather than the traditional full-time equivalent (FTE) model where clients are billed on the number of work hours,"" Bhardwaj said. Its early bet on combining synthetic chemistry with fermentation and enzymatic processes paid off, enabling it to lead in complex modalities like peptides, ADCs, and oligonucleotides. Capacity Expansion While global pharma companies are jittery about outsourcing research and manufacturing of their prized assets to Chinese CRDMOs due to potential data or intellectual property (IP) breaches - in addition to supply chain disruptions and uncertainties of trade war – yet Chinese CRDMOs score over Indian companies in terms of capacity and execution speed, industry executives have said. Bhardwaj said Anthem is attempting to meet this demand and is expanding aggressively with a capex investment of Rs 451.4 crore. The Unit III (NeoAnthem) is operational, and the unit IV is under construction on a 30-acre site at Harohalli, Karnataka, which will support both small and large molecule programs. Anthem’s proposed Unit V is planned in Hosur. By FY26, the company’s fermentation capacity is expected to reach 182 KL, and custom synthesis at 425 KL. The company said it is sitting on a net cash of Rs 622.8 crore to fund this expansion. Anthem’s client base includes more than 550 pharma and biotech firms, with top 5 customers contributing 70% of revenue, point towards concentration risk. “These are sticky relationships,” CFO Mohammed Gawir Baig said. “We’re embedded in their filings, their IP, their future.” More than half of Anthem revenue comes from US, followed by Europe, India and rest of Asia. The company’s facilities have passed multiple USFDA, PMDA, and TGA inspections with zero observations."

"FMCG volume growth seen soft, early monsoon dented demand for summer-related products, says Axis Securities",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/fmcg-volume-growth-seen-soft-early-monsoon-dented-demand-for-summer-related-products-says-axis-securities-13258136.html,"The FMCG volume growth for the June quarter is expected to stay soft, as was the trend during the fourth quarter for the last fiscal, with rural India outperforming urban areas due to demand weakness, Axis Securities said in a note ahead of the earnings season, adding that early rains have hurt some of the summer season sales. Consumer companies also face stiff regional competition, a rising trend of D2C brands and inventory pressures in trade channels, which has been worsened by a summer season sale that has been largely muted, the note said. ""Summer-reliant categories such as beverages, ice cream, and talcum powder are likely to witness pressure this quarter,"" the note added, underscoring the impact of unseasonal rain and early monsoon. The note said investors can hope for a recovery in demand and consumer sentiment in the second half of the fiscal. ""Looking ahead, growth momentum is expected to be supported by monetary policy easing, income tax benefits, a healthy monsoon outlook, and government measures aimed at boosting disposable incomes, which could uplift consumer sentiment and drive demand recovery by H2FY26,"" said Axis Securities. Not just volumes, even margins could stay subdued during the June quarter earnings, owing to 'elevated raw material inventory costs and subdued operating leverage', however, easing input prices could provide margin relief from Q2FY26 onward, said the Axis note. In this context, the note has underscored Britannia and DOMS Industries to outperform peers in the FMCG pack in the June quarter earnings, while Trent and D-Mart could do well in the retail space. This is likely on account of a recovery in smaller towns which could help value retailers such as D-Mart while premium retailers like Trent and Ethos are expected to maintain growth momentum. Axis Securities said it expects Britannia to report 8% YoY revenue growth along with a 5% volume growth during the June quarter. Investors should also watch out for the effectiveness of recent price hikes, a crucial factor which will need to be monitored in the coming quarters.

"Bharat Dynamics, GRSE, HAL, other defence stocks decline up to 3%: Here are the likely triggers",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/bharat-dynamics-grse-hal-other-defence-stocks-decline-up-to-3-here-are-the-likely-triggers-13257810.html,"Defence stocks tumbled in trade today, buoyed by several factors. The sharp fall in the share prices pushed the Nifty India Defence index down nearly 1.4 percent to hover around 8,739 in the morning. After a significant rally, defence stocks have seen significant volatility recently. While geopolitical tensions around the globe fuel the sentiment, analysts flag elevated valuations and lack of fresh triggers. Motilal Oswal gives 'Neutral' rating to BDL shares Bharat Dynamics (BDL) shares were the top loser on the index, dropping over 3 percent to trade at Rs 1,917 apiece. This comes after Motilal Oswal Financial Services initiated coverage on the stock with a 'Neutral' rating and a target price of Rs 1,900 apiece. This implies a downside potential of more than 4 percent from the stock's previous closing price of Rs 1,985 apiece. ""We like the business model of BDL and its ability to scale up its revenues and order book in current scenario, however, with fair valuations, we would look for lower price points to enter the stock,"" the brokerage said. It expects the firm's revenue growth to rebound and benefit from emergency procurement pipeline. Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers (GRSE) shares followed, dropping over 3 percent to trade at Rs 2,890 apiece. While the stock has dropped nearly 11 percent in the past one month, it has rallied over 96 percent in the past six months. Data Patterns and Zen Technologies shares plunged over 2 percent each, while Solar Industries, Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) and Cochin Shipyard shares declined over 2 percent each. Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders, Bharat Electronics (BEL) and Paras Defence shares were down over 0.6 percent, while those of BEML were trading in the red with marginal losses. Concerns over elevated valuations The defence stocks have been in focus on hopes of higher order inflows, after the Indian military conducted targeted strikes against terrorist outfits in Pakistan under the codename 'Operation Sindoor' in May. As the geopolitical tensions between India and Pakistan eased, the escalations in Russia-Ukraine war continued to support the rally in defence stocks. The rise in tensions between Israel and Iran further boosted the stocks. However, analysts have mixed views regarding the space, with some flagging elevated valuations in these stocks. Easing geopolitical tensions The fall in the defence stocks also comes on the back of overall easing geopolitical tensions. US President Donald Trump had hinted at a possible Gaza ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas this week. This comes amid Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s visit to US. Earlier, the easing tensions between Iran and Israel after significant escalations in the oil-rich middle east, had pushed down the stocks. Profit booking after record rally Defence stocks may have also dropped as investors booked profits at elevated levels. The stocks have seen significant surge in 2025 so far. BDL shares have gained over 69 percent this year, while those of jumped 75 percent. HAL shares are up 19 percent while Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders shares are up nearly 46 percent.

"Jane Street unlikely to get any immediate relief against SEBI order, say legal experts",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/jane-street-unlikely-to-get-any-immediate-relief-against-sebi-order-say-legal-experts-13257718.html,"Global high frequency trading major Jane Street, which is planning to challenge the SEBI order banning it from the Indian markets, is unlikely to get an immediate relief though an appeal could lead to a time bound final order being passed by the regulator, say legal experts. Lawyers specialising in securities market matters further add that since the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has passed an interim order, the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) could, without providing any kind of stay order, direct the regulator to pass a final order within a specified period. SAT is the designated tribunal to appeal against orders issued by the capital market regulator. “At the appeal stage, the first outcome could be a direction to SEBI for a time bound disposal in the form of a final order,” said Jayesh H, co-founder, Juris Corp Advocates & Solicitors. “It is highly unlikely that the order is completely set aside as even the Supreme Court has ruled that SEBI has powers to issue interim ex-parte orders in instances where there is market wide ramifications and irrevocable damage could be done if SEBI were to not issue such orders,” he added. Also Read: Jane Street leveraged India entity to breach FPI rules, powering trading strategy for alleged illicit gains In an order issued on Friday last week, SEBI banned Jane Street and its India arms from trading in Indian securities, and sought to impound Rs 4,843.5 crore in alleged unlawful gains linked to expiry-day manipulation using cash and futures trades to distort options pricing. As per SEBI, Jane Street made a profit of Rs 36,671 crore between January 2023 and March 2025. “Matters related to market manipulation are tricky ones and at this stage, SEBI only has to show ‘enough’ to convince the tribunal that something wrong has happened and it is working towards final disposal of the matter,” said another lawyer on conditions of anonymity. “There have been instances in the past when SAT has directed SEBI to issue a final order while giving a specified period of time and also giving the affected party an opportunity to present their case in front of the regulator. It is highly likely that the same logic would be applied to this matter as well,” he added. Incidentally, SEBI in its order has emphasised on the allegations related to market manipulation and fraudulent trades. The order states that Jane Street resorted to undertaking prima facie manipulative ‘extended marking the close’ trading pattern on the index and constituent stocks towards the close on expiry day, so as to influence and manipulate the index for illegal advantage. Also Read: Criminal prosecution against Jane Street? Sebi Act empowers watchdog to seek fine and imprisonment of up to 10 years Meanwhile, Sumit Agrawal, Founder, Regstreet Law Advisors and a former legal officer of SEBI, is of the view that while the interim order is rich in detail and reflects SEBI’s broader concerns about trading behaviour around derivatives expiry, the legal threshold for proving market manipulation under Indian law is quite high. “The order leans significantly on circumstantial indicators like timing and market impact, but absent clear evidence of intent or artificial price creation, those arguments may not be legally decisive,” says Agrawal. Jane Street, on its part, has already disputed the allegations in SEBI’s interim order, and has communicated to its staff that it will challenge the regulatory ban. In a communique to its employees, it said that the trades under question were “basic index arbitrage trading”, adding that it was “beyond disappointed” by what it called “extremely inflammatory” accusations by SEBI, and is working on a formal response. “Jane Street may argue that its actions formed part of a legitimate, rule-based trading model designed for hedging or liquidity management. It could also point to the transparent execution of trades via the exchange, and stress the lack of intent to mislead or cause artificial price movement. Additionally, there may be questions raised about procedural fairness, given the ex-parte nature of the order,” said Agrawal while adding that if the global high frequency trading major can establish that the trading was lawful and not intended to distort the market, relief from SAT is certainly within the realm of possibility.

IREDA shares rise over 2% ahead of Q1 results; Gensol exposure puts spotlight on asset quality,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/ireda-shares-rise-over-2-ahead-of-q1-results-gensol-exposure-puts-spotlight-on-asset-quality-13257345.html,"Shares of Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA) rose over 2 percent to Rs 170 on July 10 ahead of its June quarter earnings announcement due later in the day. The state-run lender had earlier shared a business update, offering a glimpse into its operational performance for the first quarter of FY26. Loan sanctions during the April–June period rose 28.5 percent year-on-year to Rs 11,740 crore, while disbursements grew 31.1 percent to Rs 6,981 crore, signalling continued momentum in the renewable energy financing space. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates The company’s loan book expanded to nearly Rs 80,000 crore, up 26.5 percent from the Rs 63,207 crore recorded in the same quarter last year. As IREDA prepares to release its full financials, key metrics to watch include growth in assets under management (AUM), loan mix, and most notably, asset quality—a metric that has attracted scrutiny due to its exposure to Gensol Engineering, a firm now undergoing insolvency proceedings. IREDA has a total exposure of Rs 470 crore to Gensol, comprising a term loan of Rs 254.9 crore and working capital facilities worth Rs 215.7 crore. The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has admitted IREDA’s insolvency plea against the borrower.

TCS shares trade flat ahead of Q1 results: What to expect?,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/tcs-shares-trade-flat-ahead-of-q1-results-what-to-expect-13257162.html,"The shares of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) were trading flat on July 10, ahead of the firm's Q1 FY26 results announcement, which will effectively open the earnings season for the IT pack. The shares of the IT major were trading with minor gains and losses in the morning. At 10.30 am, the stock was up 0.02 percent to hover around Rs 3,384 apiece.

While intimating stock exchanges about the same, the company had said that its board will meet on July 10 to consider and approve the results and a dividend. TCS shareholders eye dividend announcement; record date announced: The record date to determine the eligibility of the shareholders set to receive the possible dividend has been set at July 16. ""The interim dividend, if declared, shall be paid to the equity shareholders of the Company whose names appear on the Register of Members of the Company or in the records of the Depositories as beneficial owners of the shares as on Wednesday, July 16, 2025, which is the Record Date fixed for the purpose,"" the company said. What to expect from TCS Q1 results? Analysts have suggested that the IT sector may see a soft earnings season, amid global uncertainties. ""If the final U.S. tariffs are pushed on the consumer, U.S. inflation will rise, which is injecting continued uncertainty for global corporations and could drag growth in IT,"" said Girish Pai, analyst at BOBCAPS. Equirius Capital expects TCS' US revenue to dip sequentially by 0.4 percent in CC terms. It noted that tepid growth will largely be driven by expected ramp down in BSNL deal and some softness in sales growth in international markets. The firm expects EBIT margins to improve marginally as soft demand will likely result into lower operating. ""Equirus expects material dip in TCV QoQ given seasonal softness,"" it added. ICICI Securities has projected TCS to report a decline of 3.4 percent CC, ""led by $300 million quarterly ramp-down from BSNL deal, partly offset by resilient growth in international markets led by BFSI"". Axis Securities expects TCS revenue to fall 0.3 percent sequentially in Q1, driven by the impact from BSNL deal. ""EBIT margin to remain flattish by 60 bps during the quarter,"" it said. Ashika Institutional Equity Research expects TCS to report a sequential decline of 0.5 percent in USD revenue, amid the likely revenue impact of the BSNL deal ramp down. What to watch out for in TCS Q1 results? The key things to watch out for in TCS quarterly show include demand outlook in BFSI, retail, communication, hi-tech and other key segments, as well as any impact of volatile macro environment and tariff issues on demand. The firm's deal pipeline, outlook on CY25E/FY26E IT budgets, any further update on growth strategies as well as possible wage hike and new deal with BSNL will be in focus. TCS share price history TCS shares have dropped over 2 percent in the past one month, and nearly 21 percent in the past six months. The stock is down around 18 percent in 2025 so far. The sharp fall came on the back of global uncertainties, buoyed by US President Donald Trump's tariff flip flops.

Moneycontrol reported citing sources that the under-recovery will be funded through the proceeds of excise duty hikes, and will be channelled via the Consolidated Fund of India. The Finance Ministry is finalizing the contours of the deal, and a Cabinet approval for the compensation could be sought soon, it is learnt. Sources also told Moneycontrol that the Finance Ministry has agreed to this proposed fund that be to the tune of Rs 32,000-35,000 crore, though this is lower than the Petroleum Ministry's initial demand of Rs 40,000 crore. In April this year, domestic LPG prices were raised by Rs 50 per cylinder, which resulted in a decrease in under-recoveries. OMCs have been hopeful in recent quarters about some mechanism to address the rising LPG recoveries. ""We are hopeful some mechanism definitely because after increase of Rs 50, now the under-recovery has come down every month, we are expecting around Rs 650-700 crore per month for BPCL. And we are hopeful some mechanism will be put in place so that maybe on a quarterly basis, we can get the reimbursement, whatever under recovery,"" VRK Gupta, Dir - Finance at BPCL had said in May 2025. BPCL said the current under recovery per cylinder is estimated around Rs 170 per cylinder, and the total negative buffer as on March 31, 2025 is Rs 10,446 crore. HPCL has absorbed almost Rs 10,900 crore of LPG under recovery, the company said in May 2025, but after the government raised prices of LPG by Rs 50, the under-recovery came down to around Rs 165-170 per cylinder for the company. The Centre has in the past said that the excise duty hike on petrol and diesel would be used for payment of the LPG under-recovery."

"Vedanta, Hindustan Zinc shares extend losses to 2nd day after short-seller's report; group's base metal CEO quits",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/vedanta-hindustan-zinc-shares-in-green-after-group-denies-viceroy-research-s-ponzi-scheme-allegations-13256788.html,"The shares of Vedanta were trading in the red on July 10, a day after the stock crashed over 8 percent intraday following American short-seller Viceroy Research's allegations regarding its parent company. The shares of the company were down nearly 1.5 percent to hover around Rs 434.30 apiece, as seen at 11.34 am. US-based short seller Viceroy Research on July 9 said that it has taken a short position on the debt of Vedanta Resources, saying that it resembles a 'Ponzi scheme'. It called the parent company of Vedanta a ""parasite holding company with no significant operations of its own, propped up entirely by cash extracted from its dying host, Vedanta Limited"". Anil Agarwal-owned mining conglomerate is systematically draining Vedanta to service its own debt, Viceroy further said. ""VRL's actions to meet its short-term obligations directly impair its creditors’ long-term ability to recover their principal, a situation that resembles a Ponzi scheme where Vedanta stakeholders, which include VRL creditors, are the 'suckers',"" it added. Vedanta shares had crashed over 8 percent intraday on July 9 after the report was published. The stock later made some recovery to close 3 percent lower. The recovery was fuelled after Vedanta issued a clarification, strongly denying the claims. ""Viceroy Research report is a malicious combination of selective misinformation and baseless allegations to discredit the Group,"" Vedanta said in a stock exchange filing. ""It has been issued without making any attempt to contact us with the sole objective creating false propaganda. It only contains compilation of various information - which is already in the public domain, but the authors have tried to sensationalise the context to profiteer from market reaction,"" added Vedanta. ""The timing of the report is suspect and could be to undermine the forthcoming corporate initiatives. Our stakeholders are discerning enough to understand such tactics. In fact, to avoid any responsibility – authors of the report have added various disclaimers that the report has been prepared for educational purposes only and expresses their opinions and are not statements of fact,” the company further said. Notably, Vedanta is set to hold its Annual General Meeting (AGM) later today. Investors will actively await Chairman Anil Agarwal's speech, which may address the short-seller's allegations. Hindustan Zinc shares were also trading in the red, after seeing a strong downturn yesterday. The American short-seller had alleged that Hindustan Zinc's resources are being ""looted"" through related-party deals with promoter-family owned companies and unjustifiable brand fees. ""Vedanta's crown jewel may be its biggest liability,"" it said while speaking about Hindustan Zinc. Also read: Our LIVE blog on stock market updates Chris Griffith, the CEO of the base metals business of Vedanta Resources, has left the mining firm in recent days, Bloomberg reported. He was in charge of some of Vedanta's key assets like zinc mines in South Africa and neighboring Namibia. He was also the President of the firm's international business. Moneycontrol couldn't independently verify the report. Debt doesn't seem to be a challenge for Vedanta, and all its entities are self-sufficient, said Rakesh Arora, Managing Partner at Go India Advisors. Speaking to CNBC-TV18, Arora noted that the lenders wouldn't have approved the company's demerger if debt was a problem. ""Viceroy is two years late on Vedanta. The claims don't hold any ground now. I don't think there is fundamentally any any issue in Vedanta,"" he further told the publication. ""Vedanta has done phenomenally well in the last two-three years, and things will only get better hereon,"" he added.

"Sensex, Nifty fall for 2nd day as IT stocks slip ahead of TCS Q1 results; small, midcaps pare gains",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sensex-nifty-fall-for-2nd-day-as-it-stocks-slip-ahead-of-tcs-q1-results-small-midcaps-outperform-13256644.html,"Benchmark indices Nifty and Sensex slipped lower for a second session in a row on July 10 as investors adopted a wait-and-watch approach ahead of the Q1 earnings season and a potential trade deal between India and the US. IT stocks slipped ahead of Q1 earnings kickstarting today, while the broader market pared gains to trade flat. At about 10:20 am, the Sensex was down 179.98 points or 0.22 percent at 83,356.10, and the Nifty was down 61.95 points or 0.24 percent at 25,414.15. About 1804 shares advanced, 1329 shares declined, and 150 shares remained unchanged. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates ""The strength on Wall Street may partly reflect optimism about a potential trade agreement between the U.S. and the European Union. Reports indicate that EU negotiators are closing in on a trade deal with the U.S. that would cement higher tariffs than those granted to the U.K,"" Devarsh Vakil, Head of Prime Research at HDFC Securities, said. He added that any progress in finalising trade agreements over the coming weeks and months should reduce uncertainty, while any flexibility in lowering tariffs should help contain inflation and growth concerns. NSE sectoral indices were largely negative in early trade on Thursday, with the India VIX rising 1.01 percent, indicating a slight uptick in market volatility. Nifty Realty was the top gainer, up 0.86 percent, followed by modest gains in Nifty Metal and Private Bank, which rose 0.20 percent and 0.11 percent, respectively. Nifty Smallcap 100 and Consumer Durables saw marginal gains, while Midcap 100 was flat. On the flip side, Nifty IT and Pharma were the biggest losers, down 0.72 percent and 0.73 percent, respectively. Other indices trading in the red included Auto, Bank, Energy, FMCG, Infrastructure, Media, Oil & Gas, and PSU Bank, all slipping between 0.04 and 0.37 percent. Also read: Groww, Zerodha together lose 11 lakh active investors in the first half of 2025 As for individual stocks, Prestige Estates Projects rose 2 after global and domestic brokerages issued upbeat views on the real estate developer, citing its strongest-ever quarterly performance and robust outlook. Morgan Stanley maintained an Overweight rating with a target price of Rs 1,700, while Nuvama raised its target to Rs 2,009 and reiterated a Buy call. Shares of housing finance companies rose by up to 5 percent after Bernstein initiated coverage on four listed firms with a largely positive view on the sector, citing structural growth opportunities and business model resilience. The brokerage has rated HomeFirst Finance, Aptus Value Housing, and Aadhar Housing Finance as ‘Outperform’, while assigning a ‘Market Perform’ rating to Aavas Financiers. TCS shares slipped 1 percent ahead of its Q1 results later today. The IT giant is likely to report a slight improvement in dollar revenue growth for the June quarter on a sequential basis. The country’s largest IT services firm, set to announce its first-quarter results on Thursday evening, is also expected to post a rise in net profit, reversing the decline seen in the previous quarter. As long as the index holds above 25,350, the bullish undertone is expected to strengthen. However, a sustained close above the 25,500 mark will be vital to establish a clear directional bias in the next session. On the downside, the 25,300–25,400 zone has emerged as a critical support area, where the index has repeatedly found buying interest. A decisive close above 25,550 backed by strong buying could reinvigorate bullish momentum and open the door toward the psychological barrier of 26,000. Maruti Suzuki, Jio Financial Services, Eternal, IndusInd Bank, and Tata Steel were the top gainers on the Nifty. Laggards on the index included Bharti Airtel, Cipla, Dr Reddy's, Wipro, and Apollo Hospitals Enterprises.

The brokerage has rated HomeFirst Finance (up 5.4%), Aptus Value Housing (up 2%), and Aadhar Housing Finance (up 1%) as ‘Outperform’, while assigning a ‘Market Perform’ rating to Aavas Financiers (down 1%). Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates For HomeFirst Finance, the target price is set at Rs 1,650 per share, implying an upside potential of 22 percent from the last close on the NSE. The international brokerage highlighted the company’s ability to replicate its operating model across multiple states consistently. Its smaller size allows for faster growth and better productivity metrics, which gives it more flexibility to sustain profitability compared to peers. Aptus Value Housing received a target of Rs 400 per share, implying an upside potential of 17 percent from the last close of Rs 342 on the NSE. Bernstein noted that the company’s higher share of fixed-rate loans and exposure to small business lending positions it well in a falling interest rate environment. Valuations were seen as reasonable. Also read: Groww, Zerodha together lose 11 lakh active investors in the first half of 2025 Aadhar Housing Finance was assigned a target of Rs 550 per share. This implies an upside of 22.5 percent from the last close on the NSE. As the largest and most geographically diversified player among peers, Bernstein expects it to maintain a steady growth trajectory of around 20 percent AUM CAGR. Aavas Financiers, however, was rated ‘Market Perform’ with a target of Rs 2,070 per share. The brokerage forecasts an upside of 5 percent from the last close. Bernstein pointed to weaker yield and profitability metrics, a recent slowdown in growth, and inconsistent outcomes from geographic expansion as reasons for its more cautious stance. A near-term rebound is possible, the brokerage added. Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol are their own and not those of the website or its management.

"Sensex, Nifty likely to open flat as investors await Q1 earnings, US trade deal clarity",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sensex-nifty-likely-to-open-flat-as-investors-await-q1-earnings-us-trade-deal-clarity-13256195.html,"Benchmark indices Nifty and Sensex are expected to open largely flat on Thursday as consolidation continues, with investors adopting a wait-and-watch approach ahead of the Q1 earnings season and a potential trade deal between India and the US. At approximately 7:50 a.m., the Gift Nifty was trading at 25,555, up 0.1 percent. In the previous session, the equity benchmark indices closed lower as investors turned cautious ahead of the start of the earnings season and the expected trade deal announcement between India and the United States, with selling pressure seen in IT and oil & gas stocks. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Both Foreign Institutional Investors (FII/FPI) and Domestic Institutional Investors (DII) were net buyers on July 9, with FIIs buying shares worth Rs 77 crore while domestic institutional investors (DII) were net buyers of shares worth Rs 920 crore. Here are the important levels to watch out for in today's session As long as the index holds above 25,350, the bullish undertone is expected to strengthen. However, a sustained close above the 25,500 mark will be vital to establish a clear directional bias in the next session. On the downside, the 25,300–25,400 zone has emerged as a critical support area, where the index has repeatedly found buying interest. A decisive close above 25,550 backed by strong buying could reinvigorate bullish momentum and open the door toward the psychological barrier of 26,000. ""A strong move above Tuesday’s high of 57,303 for the Bank Nifty would validate bullish sentiment and pave the way for further upside traction. Importantly, the index did not witness any major breakdown, underscoring the strength of buyers holding their ground,"" Dhupesh Dhameja of SAMCO Securities said. Onn the downside, the zone between 56,800–57,000 remains a key demand area, where the index has repeatedly bounced and found firm footing, he added. India VIX eased by 2.09 percent, closing at 11.94, remaining well below its psychological threshold of 15. The continued low volatility environment indicates subdued fear in the market, typically favouring a gradual and steady uptrend over sharp directional swings. The Put-Call Ratio (PCR) has slipped sharply to 0.70 from 0.93, signalling increased bearish bias due to heightened call writing.

Track the latest updates on GIFT Nifty right here on Moneycontrol. Benchmark indices ended on a negative note after a rangebound session on July 9, with last-hour selling taking Nifty below 25,500 as investors stayed cautious ahead of US President Trump's announcement of trade deals with seven more countries on Wednesday. At close, the Sensex was down 176.43 points or 0.21 percent at 83,536.08, and the Nifty was down 46.40 points or 0.18 percent at 25,476.10. Broader indices outperformed the main indices with BSE midcap index was ended flat, while smallcap index added 0.5 percent. Here is how financial markets across the globe fared overnight: GIFT Nifty (Up) The GIFT Nifty is trading higher at around 25,569, indicating a positive start for the day. Asian Equities (Mixed) Asian shares opened cautiously as investors held back from taking risky bets after President Donald Trump ruled out extending his August deadline. Copper futures fell on Trump’s tariff threat. US Equities (Gain) Wall Street indexes closed higher on Wednesday, led by the tech-heavy Nasdaq as Nvidia briefly reached a $4 trillion valuation, and Federal Reserve meeting minutes fueled hopes that inflation pressures from President Donald Trump's tariffs would not derail interest rate cuts this year. The minutes for the mid-June meeting showed that most Fed officials said they expect rate cuts will be appropriate later this year, with price shocks from Trump's import taxes expected to be ""temporary or modest."" However, there was little support for a rate cut at the end of July meeting. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 217.54 points, or 0.49%, to 44,458.30, the S&P 500 gained 37.74 points, or 0.61%, to 6,263.26 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 192.87 points, or 0.95%, to 20,611.34. US Bond Yield (Down) The yields on the 10-year Treasury and 2-year Treasury yields were trading marginally lower at 4.33 percent and 3.84 percent respectively. Dollar Index (Down) The U.S. dollar slipped further from a two-week high versus major peers on Thursday, as President Donald Trump's latest tariff salvos failed to shake markets, except in Brazil where a threatened 50% levy sent the real sliding as much as 2.8% overnight. Asian currencies (Gain) Asian currencies were trading mostly higher in the early trade on Thursday with Thai Baht leading the gainers followed by Japanese Yen, Philippines Peso, South Korean Won, Malaysian Ringgit and Singapore Dollar. Crude (Down) Oil prices dropped on Thursday as the latest tariff announcements by U.S. President Donald Trump were perceived by market participants to threaten global economic growth and demand for the resource. Gold (Up) Gold held a small gain, as investors weighed President Donald Trump’s latest trade demands along with the outlook for the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate cycle. Fund Flow Action The Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) bought equities worth Rs 77 crore on July 9, while Domestic institutional investors (DIIs) also bought equities worth Rs 920 crore on the same day.

SEBI proposes to opening up activities for credit rating agencies,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sebi-proposes-to-opening-up-activities-for-credit-rating-agencies-13251964.html,"After proposing to open up business activities for mutual funds, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has now suggested easing restrictions on credit rating agencies (CRAs). The market regulator has proposed that rating agencies be allowed to undertake activities not regulated by SEBI, subject to certain conditions. For instance, they may be permitted to rate financial instruments that fall under the purview of other financial sector regulators, provided they comply with the regulatory framework specified by the regulator concerned. This includes aspects such as policy, eligibility criteria, risk management, investor grievance mechanisms, dispute resolution, inspection, enforcement and claims. The conditions outlined in SEBI’s proposal include that rating agencies can undertake only fee-based and non-fund-based rating activities. Activities not regulated by SEBI must be carried out strictly at arm’s length through one or more separate business units (SBUs) of the rating agency. These SBUs must be segregated by a Chinese Wall and ring-fenced from SEBI-regulated activities. Rating agencies must transfer all non-SEBI-regulated activities to a separate unit within six months of the date of SEBI’s notification. Separate records must be maintained for the non-SEBI-regulated activities within the SBU. Staff involved in these activities must be distinct from those engaged in SEBI-regulated functions. According to SEBI’s proposal, the information technology infrastructure may be shared between SEBI-regulated and non-SEBI-regulated activities, provided proper procedures approved by the rating agency’s board are followed. Additionally, the minimum net worth of the rating agency must be ring-fenced to prevent any impact arising from non-SEBI-regulated activities. Rating agencies will also be required to disclose on their websites the list of activities that are not regulated by SEBI. Before undertaking such activities, upfront disclosures must be made to all stakeholders, including clients, beneficiaries and counterparties. The same disclosure must be included in all engagement letters, contracts, agreements and business communications. A confirmation must also be obtained from stakeholders at the time of engagement, stating that they understand the nature of the activity, the associated risks and the absence of SEBI’s investor protection mechanisms. For existing and ongoing arrangements involving such activities, rating agencies must make the necessary disclosures, obtain the required confirmations or acknowledgements from stakeholders and submit a compliance report to SEBI within six months of the proposal’s notification. Financial sector regulators include the Reserve Bank of India, Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India, Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority, International Financial Services Centres Authority, Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India or any other authority specified by SEBI. SEBI has invited feedback on the consultation paper by July 30."

Outlook for July 10 Aditya Gaggar Director of Progressive Shares A rangebound activity was witnessed for most part of the session, but a sudden fall in the last session dragged the Index lower to close the trade at 25,476.10 with a loss of 46.40 points. FMCG was the top gainer, followed by Auto, whereas Realty and Metal declined by over 1.40% each. A mixed trend was seen among the Broader markets, where Midcaps more or less moved in tandem with Nifty50, while Smallcaps outperformed. Despite the Flag and Pole formation breakout, the Index failed to capitalise on the positive momentum and formed a bearish candle. In terms of levels, 25,580 and 25,430 will continue to act as immediate resistance and support, respectively. Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets traded in a volatile but in a narrow range and ended marginally lower, extending the ongoing consolidation phase. After an initial dip, the Nifty attempted to recover in the first half; however, a sharp decline in select heavyweights during the final hours derailed the recovery and dragged the index lower. Eventually, the Nifty settled at 25,476.10, down by 0.18%. On the sectoral front, the mixed trend persisted—FMCG and auto sectors edged higher, while realty, metal, and IT were among the top losers. The broader market also reflected a mixed performance, with the small-cap index gaining over half a percent, while the mid-cap index ended almost flat. While the tariff-related concerns linger, the focus now shifts to the earnings season, with IT major, TCS, scheduled to announce its results on Thursday, July 10. Additionally, the weekly expiry could add to the choppiness. Amid all this, we maintain our bullish stance and recommend continuing with a “buy on dips” strategy, with a strong emphasis on stock selection. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities Nifty witnessed range-bound movement after a strong upmove, facing stiff resistance around 25,500–25,550. On the hourly chart, the index has slipped below the 50-hour simple moving average, while the RSI has also moved below the 50 mark, indicating weakening momentum. However, it continues to hold above the breakout zone of 25,200–25,250, which may act as immediate support in the short term. As long as this level is sustained, the broader trend remains positive. A sustained move above 25,550 could trigger fresh upside.

Metal index plunges 2%: Viceroy Research's report on Vedanta Resources among key factors behind bearish movement,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/metal-index-plunges-2-viceroy-research-s-report-on-vedanta-resources-among-key-factors-behind-bearish-movement-13248630.html,"Metal stocks sharply plunged in the second half of July 9, pushing the Nifty Metal index down nearly 2 percent to emerge as the top sectoral loser on the market today. While the index was hovering in the red since morning, the selling pressure intensified after short seller Viceroy Research issued a report on its parent firm Vedanta Resources (VRL), claiming that the Anil Agarwal-led conglomerate ""resembles a Ponzi scheme"". Viceroy Research shorts Vedanta Resources debt, calls it a 'parasite' The US-headquartered short seller took a short position of VRL’s debt, calling it a ""parasite holding company with no significant operations of its own, propped up entirely by cash extracted from its dying host, Vedanta Limited"".Vedanta – Limited Resources Viceroy is short of Vedanta Resources (PropCo), the heavily indebted parent & majority owner of Vedanta Limited (NSE : VEDL). The group structure is financially unsustainable, operationally compromised, & resembles a Ponzi scheme. $VEDL 1/ pic.twitter.com/U15v9tlnPm — Viceroy (@viceroyresearch) July 9, 2025 Anil Agarwal-owned mining conglomerate is systematically draining Vedanta to service its own debt, Viceroy further said. ""VRL's actions to meet its short-term obligations directly impair its creditors’ long-term ability to recover their principal, a situation that resembles a Ponzi scheme where Vedanta stakeholders, which include VRL creditors, are the ""suckers',"" it added. Vedanta shares crashed over 8 percent after the report was published. The stock has now made some recovery, trading over 3 percent lower at Rs 440 apiece. Further, the American short seller said that Hindustan Zinc's resources are being ""looted"" through related-party deals with promoter-family owned companies and unjustifiable brand fees. ""Vedanta's crown jewel may be its biggest liability,"" it said while speaking about Hindustan Zinc. The shares of the company are currently down nearly 3 percent to trade at Rs 424 apiece. A perusal of HZL’s brand fee arrangement (2% of revenues) shows that brand fees are often paid in advance on revenue “estimates”, which appear to be consistently over-estimated. This acts as a interest-free line of credit for tens of millions of dollars. $VEDL 15/ pic.twitter.com/IU8ETl0jR8 — Viceroy (@viceroyresearch) July 9, 2025 Trump threatens 50% tariff on US imports Hindustan Copper, which is part of the group, also witnessed significant selling pressure. The shares of the company dropped over 3 percent. This was further buoyed following US President Trump's threat to impose a 50 percent tariff on imported copper soon, leading to a surge in US prices of the metal by more than 12 percent. Hindalco Industries shares were meanwhile down nearly 2 percent to trade at Rs 674 apiece. ""I believe the tariff on copper, we're going to make 50%,"" the US President told reporters at a White House cabinet meeting. Following this, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in an interview with CNBC that the copper tariffs will likely be put in place by the end of July or August 1. Steel, aluminium not to be part of India-US mini trade deal, says reports Steel and aluminium stocks meanwhile plummeted amid reports stating that the two metals won’t be part of the mini trade deal which will likely be announced by US and India soon. Without any exemptions, the steel and aluminium companies will face a 50 percent tariff on exports to America. Tata Steel shares plunged over 2 percent to trade at Rs 158 apiece, while those of Steel Authority of India (SAIL) and National Aluminium Company (NALCO) dropped over 1.5 percent each. NMDC, JSW Steel and Adani Enterprises shares were trading in the red with marginal losses."

IT stocks drop up to 1.5% ahead of TCS Q1 results tomorrow,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/it-stocks-drop-up-to-1-5-ahead-of-tcs-q1-results-tomorrow-13247342.html,"The shares of IT companies declined in trade on July 9 as investors actively awaited the release of the first set to Q1 FY26 results from the pack. The fall in the share prices pushed the Nifty IT index down nearly half a percent to hover around 38,801 in the morning. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is scheduled to release its results for the first quarter of the ongoing financial year 2025-2026 tomorrow (July 10), effectively opening the earnings season for the IT pack. What to expect from TCS Q1 results? Analysts have suggested that the IT sector may see a soft earnings season, amid global uncertainties. Equirius Capital expects TCS' US$ revenue to dip sequentially by 0.4 percent in CC terms. It noted that tepid growth will largely be driven by expected ramp down in BSNL deal and some softness in sales growth in international markets. The firm expects EBIT margins to improve marginally as soft demand will likely result into lower operating. ""Equirus expects material dip in TCV QoQ given seasonal softness,"" it added. Axis Securities expects TCS revenue to fall 0.3 percent sequentially in Q1, driven by the impact from BSNL deal. ""EBIT margin to remain flattish by 60 bps during the quarter,"" it said. Ashika Institutional Equity Research expects TCS to report a sequential decline of 0.5 percent in USD revenue, amid the likely revenue impact of the BSNL deal ramp down. What to watch out for in TCS Q1 results? The key things to watch out for in TCS quarterly show include demand outlook in BFSI, retail, communication, hi-tech and other key segments, as well as any impact of volatile macro environment and tariff issues on demand. The firm's deal pipeline, outlook on CY25E/FY26E IT budgets, any further update on growth strategies as well as possible wage hike and new deal with BSNL will be in focus. IT stocks in red HCL Tech shares were the top loser on the index, dropping over 1 percent to trade at Rs 1,688 apiece. LTI Mindtree, Wipro and Persistent Systems shares fell around 0.7 percent each. Heavyweights Infosys, Tech Mahindra and TCS shares were trading in the red with marginal losses.

Godrej Properties shares drop 2% after 'Reduce' call from Nomura,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/godrej-properties-shares-drop-2-after-reduce-call-from-nomura-13246939.html,"The shares of Godrej Properties dropped nearly 2 percent on July 9 after Nomura initiated a 'Reduce' rating on the stock. The shares of the company were trading at Rs 2,272 apiece in the morning. Nomura initiated a 'Reduce' rating on the shares of the real estate major, with a target price of Rs 1,900 apiece. This implies a downside potential of nearly 18 percent from the stock's previous closing price of Rs 2,310 apiece. The global brokerage said that the company's pre-sales momentum was likely to be weaker than expectations. The stock's valuation looks stretched, it added. The brokerage expects the company to report pre-sales volume for FY26 at Rs 31,000 crore, lower than its guidance of Rs 32,500 crore. Volume-driven strategy poses risk of further equity dilution and execution challenges, which are visible, Nomura further said in its note. Godrej Properties shares have tumbled nearly 8 percent in the past one month, and around 9 percent in the past six months. The stock is down over 18 percent so far in 2025. While the stock declined over 30 percent in the past one year, it gained nearly 155 percent in the past five years. The stock currently has a P/E ratio of over 47. Its market capitalization stands at Rs 68,449 crore. Earlier in May, the real estate company had reported a 19 percent year-on-year fall in net profit to Rs 382 crore for the fourth quarter of the financial year 2024-2025. It had earlier reported a net profit of Rs 471 crore in Q4 FY24. Although the company reported a fall in net profit on an yearly basis, it rose by a whopping 135 percent from the Rs 163 crore net profit reported in the previous quarter (Q3 FY25). The real estate major's revenue from operations strongly surged on both terms, rising 49 percent from Q4 FY24 and 119 percent from Q3 FY25 to Rs 2,122 crore during the quarter under review. Godrej Properties also reported an EBITDA of Rs 634 crore for Q4 FY25, marking a 2 percent fall from the Rs 649 crore EBITDA reported in Q4 FY24.

Prices of US Comex copper futures jumped over 12 percent to hit a record high after Trump’s announcement, as the 50 percent rate mentioned by Trump was higher than analysts’ expectations. Shares of Vedanta, Hindustan Copper and Hindalco Industries shares fell in early trade, with shares of Hind Copper down by over 1.8 percent at 9:48 am. Also Read: Our LIVE blog on stock market updates ""I believe the tariff on copper, we're going to make 50%,"" the US President told reporters at a White House cabinet meeting. Following this, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in an interview with CNBC that the copper tariffs will likely be put in place by the end of July or August 1, and President Trump would post details regarding the same on his Truth Social media account on Tuesday. ""The idea is to bring copper home, bring copper production home, bring the ability to make copper, which is key to the industrial sector, back home to America,"" Lutnick said. He added that the administration's Section 232 investigation into US imports of the red metal was completed, much ahead of the November deadline for the review. Trump’s copper tariff dare comes as the demand for the metal is expected to rise going ahead, with increasing demand seen from data centers, car companies and power producers. Already, there are duties in place on import of steel, aluminum and automobiles into America.

Asian shares are mixed after Wall Street closes higher and edges to more records,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/asian-shares-are-mixed-after-wall-street-closes-higher-and-edges-to-more-records-2025-07-10/,"MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Asian shares were mixed in cautious trading Friday after Wall Street closed at an all-time high with Delta Air Lines kicking off earnings season with a solid outlook for the rest of 2025, spurring an airline stock rally. Chinese markets were sharply higher. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong added 1.6 % to 24,402.41, while the Shanghai Composite index climbed 1.1% to 3,546.50. Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 edged down 0.1% to 39,662.19, while South Korea's Kospi was up 0.1% to 3,185.15. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 slipped 0.1% to 8,583.40. India's BSE Sensex was flat at 83,190.28. “Just as the market was catching its breath at new highs—drunk on Nvidia fumes and blissfully ignoring the dollar’s quiet groan—President Trump tugged the rug again. A new act in the tariff opera: 35% duties on Canadian imports, with a sweeping upgrade in blanket tariffs now floating between 15% and 20%,"" Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. “Asian equities, initially hopeful, wilted into flat lines as if someone had pulled the plug on the optimism generator. There’s a growing sense now that risk has become radioactive—tradable, but only in hazmat gloves,"" he added. On Thursday, Wall Street added to its recent milestones as the market closed at an all-time high after Delta Air Lines kicked off earnings season with a solid outlook for the second half of the year. The S&P 500 rose 0.3%, inching past the record it set last week after a better-than-expected June jobs report. The Nasdaq composite edged up 0.1%, enough of a gain to notch a new high for the second day in a row. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 0.4% higher. Delta surged 12%, bringing other airlines along with it, after beating Wall Street’s revenue and profit targets. The Atlanta airline also gave a more optimistic view for the remaining summer travel season than it had just a couple months ago. The airline and other major U.S. carriers had pulled or slashed their forecasts in the spring, citing macroeconomic uncertainty amid U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff rollouts, which have consumers feeling uneasy about spending on travel. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) climbed to a new all-time high Thursday, breaking above $113,000. The token’s price jump came amid bullish momentum across risk assets and coincides with Nvidia’s surge to a $4 trillion valuation. It also comes days before the U.S. Congress’ Crypto Week on July 14, where lawmakers will debate a series of bills that could define the regulatory framework for the industry. In other dealings on Friday, benchmark U.S. crude added 44 cents to $67.01 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, advanced 41 cents to $69.05 per barrel.

"To get their own cash, people in Gaza must pay middlemen a 40% cut",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/cash-is-scarce-in-gaza-palestinians-are-paying-a-high-price-to-get-it-2025-07-10/,"DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Cash is the lifeblood of the Gaza Strip’s shattered economy, and like all other necessities in this war-torn territory — food, fuel, medicine — it is in extremely short supply. With nearly every bank branch and ATM inoperable, people have become reliant on an unrestrained network of powerful cash brokers to get money for daily expenses — and commissions on those transactions have soared to about 40%. “The people are crying blood because of this,” said Ayman al-Dahdouh, a school director living in Gaza City. “It’s suffocating us, starving us.” At a time of surging inflation, high unemployment and dwindling savings, the scarcity of cash has magnified the financial squeeze on families — some of whom have begun to sell their possessions to buy essential goods. The cash that is available has even lost some of its luster. Palestinians use the Israeli currency, the shekel, for most transactions. Yet with Israel no longer resupplying the territory with newly printed bank notes, merchants are increasingly reluctant to accept frayed bills. Gaza’s punishing cash crunch has several root causes, experts say. To curtail Hamas’ ability to purchase weapons and pay its fighters, Israel stopped allowing cash to enter Gaza at the start of the war. Around the same time, many wealthy families in Gaza withdrew their money from banks and then fled the territory. And rising fears about Gaza’s financial system prompted foreign businesses selling goods into the territory to demand cash payments. As Gaza’s money supply dwindled and civilians’ desperation mounted, cash brokers' commissions — around 5% at the start of the war — skyrocketed. Someone needing cash transfers money electronically to a broker and moments later is handed a fraction of that amount in bills. Many brokers openly advertise their services, while others are more secretive. Some grocers and retailers have also begun exchanging cash for their customers. “If I need $60, I need to transfer $100,” said Mohammed Basheer al-Farra, who lives in southern Gaza after being displaced from Khan Younis. “This is the only way we can buy essentials, like flour and sugar. We lose nearly half of our money just to be able to spend it.” In 2024, inflation in Gaza surged by 230%, according to the World Bank. It dropped slightly during the ceasefire that began in January, only to shoot up again after Israel backed out of the truce in March. About 80% of people in Gaza were unemployed at the end of 2024, according to the World Bank, and the figure is likely higher now. Those with jobs are mostly paid by direct deposits into their bank accounts. But “when you want to buy vegetables, food, water, medication -- if you want to take transportation, or you need a blanket, or anything — you must use cash,” al-Dahdouh said. Shahid Ajjour’s family has been living off of savings for two years after the pharmacy and another business they owned were ruined by the war. “We had to sell everything just to get cash,” said Ajjour, who sold her gold to buy flour and canned beans. The family of eight spends the equivalent of $12 every two days on flour; before the war, that cost less than $4. Sugar is very expensive, costing the equivalent of $80-$100 per kilogram (2.2 pounds), multiple people said; before the war, that cost less than $2. Gasoline is about $25 a liter, or roughly $95 a gallon, when paying the lower, cash price. The bills in Gaza are tattered after 21 months of war. Money is so fragile, it feels as if it is going to melt in your hands, said Mohammed al-Awini, who lives in a tent camp in southern Gaza. Small business owners said they were under pressure to ask customers for undamaged cash because their suppliers demand pristine bills from them. Thaeir Suhwayl, a flour merchant in Deir al-Balah, said his suppliers recently demanded he pay them only with brand new 200-shekel ($60) bank notes, which he said are rare. Most civilians pay him with 20-shekel ($6) notes that are often in poor condition. On a recent visit to the market, Ajjour transferred the shekel equivalent of around $100 to a cash broker and received around $50 in return. But when she tried to buy some household supplies from a merchant, she was turned away because the bills weren’t in good condition. “So the worth of your $50 is zero in the end,” she said. This problem has given rise to a new business in Gaza: money repair. It costs between 3 and 10 shekels ($1-$3) to mend old bank notes. But even cash repaired with tape or other means is sometimes rejected. After most of the banks closed in the early days of the war, those with large reserves of cash suddenly had immense power. “People are at their mercy,” said Mahmoud Aqel, who has been displaced from his home in southern Gaza. “No one can stop them.” The war makes it impossible to regulate market prices and exchange rates, said Dalia Alazzeh, an expert in finance and accounting at the University of the West of Scotland. “Nobody can physically monitor what’s happening,” Alazzeh said. A year ago, the Palestine Monetary Authority, the equivalent of a central bank for Gaza and the West Bank, sought to ease the crisis by introducing a digital payment system known as Iburaq. It attracted half a million users, or a quarter of the population, according to the World Bank, but was ultimately undermined by merchants insisting on cash. Israel sought to ramp up financial pressure on Hamas earlier this year by tightening the distribution of humanitarian aid, which it said was routinely siphoned off by militants and then resold. Experts said it is unclear if the cash brokers’ activities benefit Hamas, as some Israeli analysts claim. The war has made it more difficult to determine who is behind all sorts of economic activity in the territory, said Omar Shabaan, director of Palthink for Strategic Studies, a Gaza-based think tank. “It's a dark place now. You don't know who is bringing cigarettes into Gaza,"" he said, giving just one example. ""It's like a mafia.” These same deep-pocketed traders are likely the ones running cash brokerages, and selling basic foodstuffs, he said. “They benefit by imposing these commissions,” he said. Once families run out of cash, they are forced to turn to humanitarian aid. Al-Farra said that is what prompted him to begin seeking food at an aid distribution center, where it is common for Palestinians to jostle over one other for sacks of flour and boxes of pasta. “This is the only way I can feed my family,” he said. ___ Kullab reported from Jerusalem."
He closed his store after years of threats. Why Mexico's extortion problem is getting worse,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/he-closed-his-store-after-years-of-threats-why-mexicos-extortion-problem-is-getting-worse-2025-07-10/,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — It started with a phone call to a men’s clothing store in the heart of Mexico City’s historic center. “I need you to put together 10,000 pesos ($500) for me weekly, or else we’ll have to do something,” the voice said. The owner hung up and didn’t answer the phone again for days. But when another call came the following week, in a surge of courage and indignation the owner told the caller he wouldn’t pay, that the money demanded would have been half the store's daily income. “Well, prepare to face the consequences,” the voice said. Several years of escalating threats, visits from goons and armed robberies followed until the shop owner, who requested anonymity because he still fears retaliation, decided to close the store his grandfather had opened in 1936. Extortion is strangling businesses in Mexico. Much, but not all, of it is linked to Mexico powerful organized crime groups. While some larger companies eat it as the cost of doing business, many smaller ones are forced to close. The Mexican Employers’ Association, Coparmex, says extortion cost businesses some $1.3 billion in 2023. And this year, while other major crimes are descending, extortion continues to rise, up 10% nationally in the first quarter compared to the same period last year. In Mexico City, the number of reported extortion cases nearly doubled in the first five months of 2025 to 498, up from 249 for the same period last year. It’s the highest total at this point in the year in the past six years, according to federal crime data. After the first call in 2019, the store owner had his employees stop answering the phone for eight months. Things quieted, but in early 2020, two men came to the shop and demanded payment. The owner pretended to be a shopper and slipped out. In 2021, the weekly calls demanding money in exchange for “security” resumed. Under advice of his attorneys, eventually stopped going into the shop, instead managing everything remotely. In one of several robberies, his employees were held at gunpoint, tied up and locked in a bathroom, while the thieves took money from the cash register. Finally, after two years of threats and robberies, he reported it to authorities. Investigators demanded proof from him that he couldn’t provide because the threats were always verbal, he said. The investigation went nowhere. Reported extortion cases are only a small fraction of the reality. Mexico’s National Institute for Statistics and Geography estimated that some 97% of extortion cases were not reported in 2023. Reporting is low because of a combination of fear and skepticism that authorities will do something. Mexico City police chief Pablo Vásquez Camacho said in an interview with AP that police were receiving more reports of extortion, but recognized that they still weren’t hearing about many more. “We can’t solve something that we’re not even seeing or that isn’t being reported,” Vásquez said. The problem, said Vicente Gutiérrez Camposeco, president of the Mexico City Chamber of Commerce, “has become entrenched” in Mexico and especially the capital in recent years. Daniel Bernardi, whose family has run a popsicle shop in the historic center for 85 years, was resigned to the situation. “There isn't much to do,” he said. ""You pay when you have to pay."" Last month, the Mexico City prosecutor’s office announced that it was creating a special prosecutor’s office to investigate and prosecute extortion. In July, President Claudia Sheinbaum said she would propose legislation giving the government greater powers to pursue extortionists. This week, her administration also announced a national strategy to address extortion. There will be a phone number to anonymously report extortion; the power to immediately cancel phone numbers associated with extortion calls; local anti-extortion units to investigate cases and the involvement of Mexico's Financial Intelligence Unit to freeze bank accounts associated with extortion. Nationally, extortion cases are up more than 6% on the year. Extortion’s rapid expansion has to do with the significant sums it generates for organized crime, drawing in the country’s most powerful drug cartels among others. The Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation cartels have made extortion “one of the divisions of their criminal portfolios,” said security analyst David Saucedo. And with the cartels involved, small-time crooks take advantage of the fear and run their own little extortion rackets, pretending to be associated with larger organized crime groups. The Mexico City men's clothing store owner didn't know who was extorting him. But without help from authorities, he felt alone and exposed. The threats had grown stronger and they now said they’d kill him if he didn’t pay. The owner recalled that a nearby restaurant that had opened around the same time as his own store, had closed after its owner was killed, supposedly after not paying extortion demands. So in December 2023, he saw no other option but to close. Little by little he watched old pieces of furniture carried out of the store that his father had passed on to him as his grandfather had passed it on to his father. “When I closed I felt very sad. And then it made me so mad to think that I could still go on, but because of fear I couldn’t,” he said. “You work your whole life for them to destroy it.”"
Rubio to meet China's foreign minister in Malaysia as US-Chinese tensions mount,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/rubio-to-meet-chinas-foreign-minister-in-malaysia-as-us-chinese-tensions-mount-2025-07-10/,"KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is wrapping his up his second and final day at a Southeast Asian security conference with a high-stakes meeting with his Chinese counterpart as tensions grow between Washington and Beijing over issues from trade to security and China's support for Russia's war in Ukraine. After discussions with regional countries at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations forum in Malaysia, Rubio on Friday was close out his first official trip to Asia in his first face-to-face talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, the State Department said. The meeting comes less than 24 hours after Rubio met in Kuala Lumpur with another rival, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, during which they discussed potential new avenues to jumpstart Ukraine peace talks. The meetings come against a backdrop of global and regional unease over U.S. policies, notably on trade and large tariffs that U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to impose on friend and foe alike. While Rubio heard complaints about the tariffs from his Southeast Asian counterparts, he told reporters Thursday that many of them focused their discussion on security issues, their concerns about Chinese domination and desire for cooperation with the U.S. “Of course, it’s raised. It’s an issue,” he said. “But I wouldn’t say it solely defines our relationship with many of these countries. There are a lot of other issues that we work together on, and I think there was great enthusiasm that we were here and that we’re a part of this.” However, Trump sees China as the biggest threat to the United States in multiple fields, not least technology and trade, and like previous U.S. presidents has watched the country greatly expand its influence globally while turning increasingly assertive in the Indo-Pacific, notably toward its small neighbors over the South China Sea and Taiwan. Trump has warned of massive tariffs that he could impose on Chinese exports to the United States and preliminary discussions between the two sides have yet to produce significant progress. Since former President Joe Biden was in office, the U.S. has also accused China of assisting Russia in rebuilding its military industrial sector to help it execute its war against Ukraine. Rubio said the Trump administration shares that view. “I think the Chinese clearly have been supportive of the Russian effort, and I think that generally they’ve been willing to help them as much as they can without getting caught,” Rubio said Thursday, suggesting the topic would be discussed if he and Wang met. Rubio and Wang have been shadow boxing during the two-day ASEAN meeting with each touting the benefits of their countries' partnerships with Southeast Asian nations. While Rubio has played up cooperation with the U.S., signing a civil-nuclear cooperation agreement with Malaysia for instance, Wang has railed against Trump's threatened tariffs, notably against almost all of ASEAN's 10 member states, calling them an abuse and an attempt to subvert free and open trade and a danger to global financial stability. While noting an overall “positive” situation in East Asia, in his discussions with Southeast Asian foreign ministers, Wang warned of growing challenges brought by “unilateral protectionism and the arbitrary imposition of tariffs by certain major powers.” On Thursday, Wang and Lavrov met and delivered a subtle but unmistakable warning to the United States over Southeast Asia. “Russia and China both support ASEAN’s central role in regional cooperation, are committed to maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, and are wary of certain major powers creating divisions and instigating confrontation in the region,” they said, according to Russia's foreign ministry."
Albanese will meet with Xi next week on a trip focused on Australia-China business ties,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/albanese-will-meet-with-xi-next-week-on-a-trip-focused-on-australia-china-business-ties-2025-07-10/,"MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese will meet with China’s leader Xi Jinping on an upcoming trip he said Friday would focus on closer business ties. Albanese departs Saturday for the trip that includes stops in Beijing, Shanghai and Chengdu, and meetings with Xi, Premier Li Qiang and Chairman Zhao Leji of the National People’s Congress. Details on those meetings weren't disclosed. Albanese plans to meet business, tourism and sport representatives in Shanghai and Chengdu, his office said. He will lead a business delegation and will attend a CEO roundtable scheduled for Tuesday in Beijing. “Certainly in areas such as green energy for example, there is a real prospect of further engagement,” Albanese told reporters in Sydney. “We cooperate where we can and we disagree where we must and we’re able to have those honest conversations about some of the disagreements that are there,” he added. It will be Albanese’s second visit to China since his center-left Labor Party government was first elected in 2022. It was reelected with an increased majority in May. Albanese has managed to persuade Beijing to remove a series of official and unofficial trade barriers introduced under the previous conservative government that cost Australian exporters more than 20 billion Australian dollars ($13 billion) a year. Beijing severed communications with the previous administration over issues including Australian calls for an independent inquiry into the origins of and responses to COVID-19. But Albanese wants to reduce Australia’s economic dependence on China, a free trade partner. “My government has worked very hard to diversify trade … and to increase our relationships with other countries in the region, including India and Indonesia and the ASEAN countries,” Albanese said, referring to the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations. “But the relationship with China is an important one, as is our relationships when it comes to exports with the north Asian economies of South Korea and Japan,” he added."
Trump plans to hike tariffs on Canadian goods to 35%,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-plans-to-hike-tariffs-on-canadian-goods-to-35-2025-07-10/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said in a Thursday letter that he will raise taxes on many imported goods from Canada to 35%, deepening a rift between two North American countries that have suffered a debilitating blow to their decades-old alliance. The letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is an aggressive increase to the top 25% tariff rates that Trump first imposed in March after months of threats. Trump's tariffs were allegedly in an effort to get Canada to crack down on fentanyl smuggling despite the relatively modest trafficking in the drug from that country. Trump has also expressed frustration with a trade deficit with Canada that largely reflects oil purchases by America. “I must mention that the flow of Fentanyl is hardly the only challenge we have with Canada, which has many Tariff, and Non-Tariff, Policies and Trade Barriers,” Trump wrote in the letter. The higher rates would go into effect Aug. 1, creating a tense series of weeks ahead for the global economy as recent gains in the S&P 500 stock index suggest many investors think Trump will ultimately back down on the increases. While multiple countries have received tariff letters this week, Canada — America's second largest trading partner after Mexico — has become something of a foil to Trump. It has imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods and pushed back on the president's taunts of making Canada the 51st state. Mexico has also faced 25% tariffs because of fentanyl, yet it has not faced the same public pressure from Trump. Carney was elected prime minister in April on the argument that Canadians should keep their “elbows up.” He has responded by distancing Canada from its intertwined relationship with the U.S., seeking to strengthen its links with the European Union and the United Kingdom. Hours before Trump's letter, Carney posted on X a picture of himself with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, saying, “In the face of global trade challenges, the world is turning to reliable economic partners like Canada.” Implied in his statement was that the U.S. has become unreliable because of Trump's haphazard tariff regime, which has gone through aggressive threats and reversals. When Carney went to the White House in May, the public portion of their meeting was cordial. But Trump said there was nothing the Canadian leader could tell him to remove the tariffs. “Just the way it is,” Trump said at the time. Carney indicated he would be willing to be patient in pursuing talks on trade. “There are much bigger forces involved,” the Canadian leader said. “And this will take some time and some discussions.” Trump has sent a series of tariff letters to 23 countries so far. Those form letters became increasingly personal with Canada as well as a Wednesday note that put a 50% tariff on Brazil for the ongoing trial of its former president, Jair Bolsonaro, for trying to stay in office after his 2022 election loss. Trump was similarly indicted for his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss. The letters reflect the inability of Trump to finalize the dozens of trade frameworks that he claimed would be easy to negotiate. Shortly after unveiling his April 2 “Liberation Day” tariffs, a financial market selloff caused Trump to announce a 90-day negotiating period during which a 10% baseline tariff would be charged on most imported goods. But Trump has indicated that the 10% tariff rates are largely disappearing as he resets the rates with his letters. “We’re just going to say all of the remaining countries are going to pay, whether it’s 20% or 15%,” Trump said in a phone interview with NBC News. So far, Trump has announced trade frameworks with the U.K. and Vietnam, as well as a separate deal with China in order to enable continued trade talks. Trump jacked up import taxes on Chinese goods to as much as 145%, but after talks Trump has said China faces total tariffs of 55%. In June, Trump said he was suspending trade talks with Canada over its plans to continue its digital services tax, which would hit U.S. technology companies. A few days later, talks resumed when Carney rescinded the tax. Under the current tariff structure, the 2020 United States Mexico Canada Agreement has protected eligible goods from Trump's tariffs. But a review of the pact is scheduled for 2026."
Protesters and federal agents clash during raid at Southern California farm,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/protesters-and-federal-agents-clash-during-raid-at-southern-california-farm-2025-07-10/,"A confrontation erupted Thursday between protesters and federal officials carrying out a raid on a Southern California farm, with authorities throwing canisters that sprayed what looked like smoke into the air to disperse the crowd. Vehicles from Border Patrol and U.S. Customs and Border Protection blocked the road in a largely agricultural area of Camarillo lined with fields and greenhouses. There were military-style vehicles and a helicopter flying overhead. Television images showed dozens of demonstrators gathered on a road between fields where uniformed officers stood in a line across from them. In other images, white and green smoke can be seen as protesters retreat. Other images showed protesters shouting at agents wearing camouflage gear, helmets and gas masks. It wasn’t clear why the authorities threw the canisters or if they released chemicals like tear gas. Another image from KTLA showed people sat against a wall with their hands bound in front of them; it wasn't clear if they were workers or protesters. A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said they were executing a warrant at a marijuana facility. Glass House Farms said on social media that it was visited Thursday by officials for Immigration and Customs Enforcement and “fully complied with agent search warrants.” It's legal to grow and sell cannabis in California with proper licensing. State records show the company has multiple active licenses to cultivate cannabis. The company also has a permit to grow in Ventura County, and as of last year used half of the space for cannabis while half was dedicated to tomatoes and cucumbers, the Ventura County Star reported. Judith Ramos said she received a call Thursday morning from her father, who worked in the tomato fields. “He said immigration was outside his job, and if anything happened to take care of everything,” Ramos said, her voice cracking. The 22-year-old certified nurse assistant said she has two young siblings. Ramos went to the farm and saw a busload of people being taken out. She was protesting alongside others when agents sprayed the deterrent. “They didn't want us to get any closer, and they started firing,” Ramos said. “I got some in my eyes. I had to put milk on my face.” Ramos said she does not know where her father is and had not had contact with him for more than an hour. His truck is still at the worksite, she said. It was not immediately known which agencies participated in the raid. The incident comes as federal immigration enforcement agents have ramped up arrests in Southern California, heading to car washes, farms and Home Depot parking lots to take people into custody while stoking widespread fear among immigrant communities. The Trump administration has had the National Guard providing protection to federal immigration agents carrying out the raids, and this week it sent a large caravan with guns and horses to a park in Los Angeles. Andrew Dowd, spokesperson for the Ventura County Fire Department, said they were dispatched around 12:15 p.m. Thursday to the area to provide emergency medical aid. Crews took three people to nearby hospitals, he said, and the incident is ongoing. Dowd said he had no information on the types of injuries or medical emergencies sustained, and he did not have any details of the people sent to hospitals. He said he had no information on what law enforcement was doing there. ___ Associated Press writer Janie Har in San Francisco and freelancer Michael Owen Baker in Camarillo, California, contributed."
Global Citizen takes its fight against poverty to the world's growing cities,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/global-citizen-takes-its-fight-against-poverty-to-the-worlds-growing-cities-2025-07-10/,"DETROIT (AP) — Global Citizen is turning to cities as it looks to break through what it sees as widespread political gridlock hindering large-scale action on its goal of ending extreme poverty worldwide. The nonprofit advocacy group has rallied the private sector and foreign dignitaries to solve humanitarian challenges together, driving millions of dollars toward replenishing international aid and eradicating polio since 2008. But Global Citizen co-founder Simon Moss said Thursday it is local officials who are increasingly joining traditional international players in shaping whether communities are equipped to tackle urgent crises. “We can get beyond partisan politics a lot of the time when you’re dealing with a group of people in a city who all literally live there,"" Moss said. “That’s easier a lot of the time to get real progress compared to waiting on elected officials in capitals, who will often talk a good game and who’ll be responsive, but where, in America and many other countries, they’re finding it really hard to actually make big-picture policy decisions,"" he added. The emphasis arose when leaders heard shared concerns from partners across major African and North American cities. In Detroit, which Thursday hosted Global Citizen’s first American conference outside New York City, organizers saw an opportunity to highlight a place experiencing population growth after decades-long losses alongside the auto industry’s decline. The urban focus also reflects U.N. projections that more than two-thirds of the world's population will live in cities by 2050 — a trend that Global Citizen fears will worsen concentrated poverty if local governments don't start creating inclusive economic opportunities. To prevent under-resourced communities from missing the latest technological changes, Global Citizen unveiled a new partnership making artificial intelligence more accessible. Goodera, a company that helps implement corporate volunteer programs, aims to mobilize engineers with the goal of making 10 million people “AI literate” by 2030. Half of those people will be underserved women and youth, according to Moss. Their first focus will be bridging the digital divide in cities, according to Moss, and Goodera is helping identify those most at risk of getting left behind. They also plan to work with entrepreneurs in low-income countries. Billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban noted the transformative potential for small business owners during a panel Thursday at Global Citizen NOW: Detroit. ChatGPT can “write a business plan that's better” than anything he could write, Cuban admitted, and offers access to every piece of business advice out there. George Opare Addo, Ghana's minister of youth development and empowerment, pointed out that farmers are already using the technology's limited availability to better predict weather and improve their yields. But he said that youth must be engaged in its rollout. “For young people to be able to appreciate AI, then they must be not just users of it, but makers of it,” he said. Other panelists emphasized the need for cities to build shared cultures by fostering creative scenes and sports fandoms. Global Citizen has recently relied on high-powered sports leagues such as FIFA to raise money for education initiatives. And Cuban — who previously owned the Dallas Mavericks — said no industry unites people around a common cause like sports. “As things change in a city, the first place you look is the sports team for support, always. Every tragedy, you look to the sports team first, always,” Cuban said. “And that is so unique. You just don’t get that with any other business.” For celebrity chef Marcus Samuelsson, the food industry provides “spaces that you can have dialogues” and “opportunities to break bread.” Samuelsson's cuisine, for example, blends his Ethiopian heritage with his Swedish upbringing. Jessica Nabongo, a Ugandan-American travel blogger, recalled growing up eating Lebanese, Polish and Japanese foods in Detroit’s diverse culinary scene. That experience, she said, instilled “a respect for other people’s culture out the gate.” “There has to be a reverence — truly a reverence — for the people who are here and have been here and made the city what it is, no matter what the ebbs and flows are,” she said. As cities change, though, it is local artists who Detroit Poet Laureate jessica Care moore finds are tasked with making sure their histories remain told and their longtime residents remain seen. Good artists, she said, “paint the pictures that people can’t see” and “ask the questions that nobody’s asking.” “Artists are the pulse of the people,” she said. “If you turn cities into just places for corporations, then you lose the soul of the city. And Detroit, the soul of our city, are the people that live here.” ___ Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Trump administration opens investigation into Minnesota agency's affirmative action policy,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-administration-opens-investigation-into-minnesota-agencys-affirmative-action-policy-2025-07-10/,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The Trump administration said Thursday that it has opened an investigation into whether a Minnesota state agency's newly updated affirmative action policy violates civil rights laws. The Minnesota Department of Human Services' policy requires supervisors to provide a “hiring justification when seeking to hire a non-underrepresented candidate.” Supervisors who don't comply can be disciplined, even fired. The Department of Justice said in a statement that the policy “seems to be part of a broader effort by the state to engage in race- and sex-based employment practices in its ‘affirmative action’ objectives.” The Trump administration has been using federal civil rights law to fight diversity, equity and inclusion programs on several fronts, saying diversity preferences amount to illegal discrimination against white and Asian American people. On Thursday, the administration opened a civil rights investigation into hiring practices at George Mason University, Virginia’s largest public university. ""Minnesotans deserve to have their state government employees hired based on merit, not based on illegal DEI,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement. The policy, as first reported this week by Alpha News, a local conservative website, requires supervisors to justify their decision when hiring a candidate who doesn't come from an “underrepresented” group — women and racial minorities — for job categories where those groups are considered underrepresented. The state Department of Human Services said in a statement that it “follows all state and federal hiring laws.” It said justification for “non-affirmative action hires for some vacancies has been required by state law since 1987."" And it cited a state statute that says, “An agency that does not meet its hiring goals must justify its nonaffirmative action hires in competitive appointments and noncompetitive appointments.” In a letter Thursday to Shireen Gandhi, the state agency’s temporary commissioner, and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, the head of Justice Department's Civil Rights Division said it has reason to believe the policy is unlawful. “This hiring justification policy appears to be just one component of a broader effort by Minnesota to engage in race- and sex-based employment practices pursuant to ‘affirmative action’ objectives,” Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon wrote. Minnesota Republicans were quick to call for elimination of the policy. “This hiring policy is DEI on steroids,” Senate Minority Leader Mark Johnson, of East Grand Forks, said in a statement. In another Trump administration move against DEI programs on Thursday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture published a final rule lifting requirements for racial and gender preferences in its programs. The Justice Department has targeted other racial justice initiatives in Minnesota. In May, it backed out of a settlement with Minneapolis that called for an overhaul of its police department following the murder of George Floyd in 2020. Also in May, it opened an investigation of the prosecutor’s office in Minnesota’s most populous county after its leader directed her staff to consider racial disparities as one factor when negotiating plea deals."
"Co-worker kills Detroit-area McDonald's employee who was mom of 6, police say",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/co-worker-kills-detroit-area-mcdonalds-employee-who-was-mom-of-6-police-say-2025-07-10/,"EASTPOINTE, Mich. (AP) — A McDonald's employee returned to her Detroit-area restaurant after an argument Thursday and fatally stabbed a co-worker multiple times, police said.

Alex Holish said. “For a verbal dispute to turn into this is ridiculous,” Holish told the Macomb Daily. “People have to learn how to resolve their disputes."" The victim was identified as Jennifer Harris, a mother of six children who had worked at the McDonald's location for more than 10 years, family members said. ""My mama died trying to take care of us,” daughter Antonia Griffin said.

Missouri governor repeals paid sick leave law approved last year by voters,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/missouri-governor-repeals-paid-sick-leave-law-approved-last-year-by-voters-2025-07-10/,"JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) — Eight months after voters approved it, Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe signed the repeal of a law Thursday that had guaranteed paid sick leave to workers and inflationary adjustments to the minimum wage. The move marked a major victory for the state's largest business group and a frustrating defeat for workers' rights advocates, who had spent years — and millions of dollars — building support for the successful ballot measure. The repeal will take effect Aug. 28. Kehoe, who also signed a package of tax breaks Thursday, described the paid sick leave law as an onerous mandate that imposed burdensome record-keeping. ""Today, we are protecting the people who make Missouri work — families, job creators, and small business owners — by cutting taxes, rolling back overreach, and eliminating costly mandates,” Kehoe, a Republican, said in a statement released after a private bill-signing ceremony. The new tax law excludes capital gains from individual state income taxes, expands tax breaks for seniors and disabled residents and exempts diapers and feminine hygiene products from sales taxes. Richard von Glahn, who sponsored the worker benefit ballot initiative, said many parents felt forced to go to work, instead of staying home to care for a sick child, in order to pay for their rent or utilities. ""The governor signing this bill is an absolute betrayal to those families, and it hurts my heart,” said von Glahn, policy director for Missouri Jobs With Justice. About one-third of states mandate paid sick leave, but many businesses voluntarily provide it. Nationwide, 79% of private-sector employees received paid sick leave last year, though part-time workers were significantly less likely to receive the benefit than full-time employees, according to Department of Labor data. Voters in Alaska, Missouri and Nebraska all approved paid sick leave measures last November. Only Alaska’s, which kicked in on July 1, has remained unchanged by state lawmakers. Before Nebraska's measure could take effect Oct. 1, Republican Gov. Jim Pillen signed a measure last month exempting businesses with 10 or fewer employees from the paid sick leave requirements. The revision also lets businesses withhold paid sick leave from seasonal agricultural workers and 14- and 15-year-olds. Missouri's law allowed employees to earn one hour of paid sick time for every 30 hours worked, starting May 1. By the time it's repealed, 17 weeks will have elapsed. That means someone working 40 hours a week could have earned 22 hours of paid sick leave. If workers don't use their paid sick leave before Aug. 28, there's no legal guarantee they can do so afterward. The Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry had made repealing the law its top legislative priority. The ""paid leave and minimum wage policies were a job killer,” chamber President and CEO Kara Corches said. But Missouri voters could get a second chance at mandating paid sick leave. Von Glahn has submitted a proposed ballot initiative to the secretary of state that would reinstate the repealed provisions. Because the new measure is a constitutional amendment, the Legislature would be unable to revise or repeal it without another vote of the people. Supporters haven't decided whether to launch a petition drive to try to qualify the measure for the 2026 ballot."

Brazil vows retaliatory tariffs against US if Trump follows through on 50% import taxes,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/brazil-vows-retaliatory-tariffs-against-us-if-trump-follows-through-on-50-import-taxes-2025-07-10/,"RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said Thursday that he will impose retaliatory tariffs on the United States if President Donald Trump follows through on a pledge to boost import taxes by 50% over the South American country's criminal trial against his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro. Lula said he will trigger Brazil's reciprocity law approved by Congress earlier this year if negotiations with the U.S. fail. “If there’s no negotiation, the reciprocity law will be put to work. If he charges 50 (% tariffs) from us, we will charge 50 from them,” Lula told TV Record in excerpts of an interview that will be fully aired later in the day. “Respect is good. I like to offer mine and I like to receive it.” Lula's comments raise the risk of a tariffs war erupting between the two countries, similar to what has happened between the U.S. and China. Trump has vowed to respond forcefully if countries seek to punish the U.S. by adding tariffs of their own. The president of Brazil's Senate, Sen. Davi Alcolumbre, and Chamber of Deputies Speaker Hugo Motta, a pair of moderates who have recently been at odds with Lula, agreed that the recipricity law gives Brazil “the means ... to protect our sovereignty.” “We will be ready to act with balance and firmness in defense of our economy, our productive sector, and the protection of Brazilian jobs,” they said in a joint statement. The tariffs letter that Trump sent to Brazil — and posted on social media Wednesday — railing against the “witch hunt” trial against Bolsonaro opened up a new front in his trade wars, with the U.S. leader directly using import taxes to interfere with another nation’s domestic politics. Trump has already tried to use tariffs to ostensibly combat fentanyl trafficking and as a negotiating tool to change how other nations tax digital services and regulate their economies. In Brazil’s case, Trump is trying to dictate the outcome of the criminal trial of Bolsonaro, an ally who like Trump has been charged with attempting to overturn a presidential election. Bolsonaro maintains that he is being politically persecuted by Brazil’s Supreme Court over his charges on the alleged plot to remain in power after his 2022 election loss to Lula. “There’s nothing Lula or Brazil can do about Bolsonaro’s trial,” said Carlos Melo, a political science professor at Insper University in Sao Paulo. “Any change in that would be Brazil's capitulation. Bolsonaro’s situation here won’t change. How do you negotiate over that?"" Lula ordered his diplomats on Thursday to return Trump's letter if it physically arrives at the presidential palace in Brasilia. The document attacks the country's judiciary and mentions recent rulings on social media companies among the reasons why goods from the South American nation will have higher tariffs from Aug. 1. Trump has initiated his tariffs under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, saying in April that the persistent deficit between what the U.S. exports and what it imports is a national crisis. But the U.S. runs a trade surplus with Brazil, undermining some of the rationale. A staffer of Brazil's foreign ministry told The Associated Press that trade negotiations that were ongoing since Trump imposed a first set of tariffs in April are now “up in the air.” Some members of the Lula administration say Trump’s move is actually aimed at Brazil’s connection with other Southern economies, as displayed on Sunday at the summit of BRICS nations hosted in Rio de Janeiro. Brazil's president once again mentioned the hope for an alternative currency to the dollar for transactions, a topic that frequently draws Trump's ire. “Trump was never worried about democracy anywhere, much less with Bolsonaro’s destiny,” said Gleisi Hoffmann, Brazil’s institutional relations minister. Trump's interference in Brazilian affairs has brought a sense of unity that was largely absent in the politically divided nation. Some of Bolsonaro's allies claimed Lula had drawn the U.S. president's anger with other decisions, including criticism of Israel's war in Gaza. But other supporters of the former president chose to ask for prudence in negotiations. Daily O Estado de S. Paulo, a frequent critic of Lula and his administration, said in an editorial on Thursday that Trump’s move against the Brazilian government is “a mafia thing.” It also said Lula's reaction was correct, a rare feature for the newspaper. Analysts also see Trump’s attempt to interfere in the country's domestic affairs as a potential backfire for Bolsonaro during his trial and a push for Lula, whose reelection bid was facing unpopularity headwinds this year. Canadians recently elected Mark Carney as prime minister, with his Liberal Party reenergized by Trump’s tariffs and threats to make Canada the 51st U.S. state. “The reaction of a lot of people is that this is a political gift to Lula,” said Andre Pagliarini, a professor of history and international studies at Louisiana State University who is also affiliated with the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft. Thomas Traumann, an independent political consultant and former Brazilian minister, called Trump's move “a game changer"" for next year's election. “Trump put Lula back in the game,” Traumann said. “This gives Lula a narrative, puts Bolsonaro as the guilty part for any economic problems.” The U.S. Court of International Trade ruled in May that Trump had exceeded his authority by declaring an emergency to impose tariffs without congressional approval. The Trump administration is appealing that decision, but opponents plan to use his Brazil letter to bolster their case. “This is a brazenly illegal effort by Donald Trump to sacrifice the economy to settle his own personal scores, and it is far outside his legal authority,” said Democratic Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden. The Republican administration has argued that their tariffs are now relatively harmless for the U.S. economy, since inflation has trended down in recent months. But many companies stockpiled imports to get ahead of the import taxes, and it’s unclear what happens when their inventories dwindle and consumers consider the risk of higher prices. Most outside economic analyses expect growth to decline. In Brazil, Trump’s interest in Bolsonaro’s trial is expected to weigh over the trial. Media outlets have reported that lawmakers and judges are worried the former president will try to leave Brazil for the U.S. if he is convicted. Lawmaker Eduardo Bolsonaro, a son of the former president, moved to the U.S. in March. On Wednesday night, he asked his supporters on X to post “their thank you to President Donald Trump."" In Thursday's interview, Lula said the elder Bolsonaro “should take the responsibility for agreeing with Trump’s taxation to Brazil.” “His son went there to make up Trump’s mind, then he (Trump) writes a letter to speak about a case that is in the hands of the Supreme Court. A case that is not a political trial. What is under investigation is the evidence of the case,” Lula said. ___ Boak reported from Washington."
BigBear.ai: Why a 90% Rally Could Be Just the Start,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/bigbearai-why-a-90-rally-could-be-just-the-start/,"While Wall Street and the news media often focus on the titans of artificial intelligence (AI), a powerful, yet underreported, story is unfolding in the small-cap market space. BigBear.ai Holdings, Inc. NYSE: BBAI, a provider of AI solutions, has been on a remarkable run. Its stock has climbed nearly 90% in the last 30 days, a move that demands attention from investors looking for the next wave of AI winners. BigBear.ai’s (BBAI) explosive growth signals a potential market awakening to a company that is consistently delivering on strategic goals. The sharp upward move in BBAI's stock suggests a shift in focus, where investors are now prioritizing a compelling series of operational wins over the company's past challenges. BigBear.ai’s recent stock price climb is driven by tangible business successes that showcase its strategic expansion and technological strength. A key catalyst is the company's strategic push into international markets. BigBear.ai recently announced an exclusive partnership with Easy Lease PJSC and Vigilix Technology to bring its AI solutions to the United Arab Emirates. This deal addresses high-growth needs, such as logistics and predictive fleet maintenance, establishing a vital foothold in the Middle East. At the same time, the company is demonstrating its ability to apply its powerful technology to the commercial world. A new collaboration with Analogic will integrate BigBear.ai's ""Pro-Detect"" vision AI into airport CT scanners. This technology helps improve threat detection, creating a significant new business opportunity in aviation security. While expanding its commercial reach, BigBear.ai has also strengthened its core defense business. The company successfully demonstrated its advanced forecasting technology at the U.S. Army's prestigious Project Convergence experiment. This success reaffirms its strong relationships with government clients and validates its high-tech credentials. These wins are happening as governments worldwide increase their spending on AI capabilities. This favorable market trend provides a strong tailwind for BigBear.ai's continued growth. A closer look at the market data reveals signals that support a continued positive outlook for BigBear.ai. The recent analyst action from H.C. Wainwright is a telling indicator. On July 1, the firm maintained its Buy rating and raised its price target from $6.00 to $9.00. This suggests that Wall Street is beginning to recognize the company’s strong execution and is revising its valuation models upward. BigBear.ai also has a very high short interest, with nearly 28% of its public shares being bet against by short-selling investors. Usually, a sign of negative sentiment, this can become a powerful positive catalyst for a stock backed by good news. If the stock continues to rise, these short-sellers may be forced to buy back shares to limit their losses. This rush of buying, known as a short squeeze, can act like rocket fuel for the stock price. No investment story is without its challenges. In March 2025, BigBear.ai disclosed the need for a financial restatement and identified a material weakness in its internal controls. These past events created the initial buying opportunity for investors who could see the company's long-term potential. Today, the market appears to be forward-looking. The powerful rally since those announcements suggests investor focus has shifted squarely to the company's future. The ongoing efforts to strengthen financial governance are now seen as a necessary and positive step for a maturing public company. With procedural deadlines in related lawsuits having passed in June, the market seems confident in the company's ability to navigate these historical hurdles. The narrative is no longer defined by past issues but by the strong operational engine driving the company forward. BigBear.ai's powerful rally is built on a solid foundation of tangible achievements.

5 Hot Stocks With Summer Buybacks You Can Cash In On,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/5-hot-stocks-with-summer-buybacks-you-can-cash-in-on/,"Stock buybacks remain one of the most effective tools for boosting share prices, especially when backed by solid fundamentals. When a company is healthy, repurchasing shares reduces the float, enhances earnings per share, and signals confidence to the market. Several companies announced major repurchase plans in June and early July, combining strong balance sheets with strategic capital return. Each has the financial muscle and operational momentum to follow through, driving shareholder value in the process. Collegium Pharmaceuticals NASDAQ: COLL is a small pharmaceutical firm focused on pain management. Critical highlights in 2025 include the company’s growing revenue, positive pipeline developments, improving profitability, and profits. The profits are critical as they allow this company to return capital to shareholders, and the return has been robust. The share count fell by 20% on average year-over-year (YOY) in Q1 and can be expected to continue falling at an aggressive pace. The latest news is a new $150 million share repurchase authorization to replace the existing. Collegium’s balance sheet offers no red flags for investors. Details at the end of Q1 reflect an increased cash position, reduced intangibles, and flat assets, all of which are compounded by a reduction in total liabilities. The net result is increased equity despite the massive share count reduction and improved leverage. The long-term debt-to-equity ratio is roughly 3x, leaving the company in a healthy financial position. Enovix NASDAQ: ENVX affirmed its robust outlook by initiating a buyback plan in early July. The plan, worth $60 million over the next two years, is significant because it exceeds the company’s 2025 revenue outlook. The critical takeaway is that its rapidly improving manufacturing capability, new products, and end-market demand point to sustainable hypergrowth and the ability to follow through with the buying. The consensus forecast for 2026 predicts revenue growth of more than 300%, which may be conservative due to the mounting traction. Enovix's Balance sheet affirms its ability to buy back shares as indicated. The highlights from Q1 include reduced cash but a solid $248 million, roughly equal to its total liability. Leverage is low, and cash flow is improving, leaving it in a healthy position capable of returning $60 million comfortably over the next 18 months. That’s worth approximately 2.3% of the market cap as of early July. After a long period during which it was not allowed to buy shares, Thor Industries NYSE: THO is hammering down on buybacks again. The news from June is that the board re-authorized its $400 million allowance, and buybacks have been reducing the count since the start of the fiscal third quarter. At $400 million, the authorization is worth more than 8% of the early July market cap and will significantly boost shareholder value once completed. Critical details for Thor Industries investors are that this RV leader emerged from post-pandemic industry normalization in Q3, resuming growth and widening margins. The margin is a significant factor, providing sufficient cash flow and income to sustain balance sheet health, buyback shares, pay dividends, and increase the distribution annually. The yield is attractive at roughly 2.2%. Darden Restaurants' NYSE: DRI FQ4 2025 report provided investors with just what they wanted: growth, solid margins, improved guidance, and a healthy increase in capital return. The increase included a dividend increase and a new, $1 billion share repurchase authorization. The repurchase is worth 3.8% of the shares as of the time of the release and is expected to be completed over the coming quarters. Darden’s ability to buy back the shares is supported by its healthy balance sheet, growth outlook, and decision to sell Bahama Breeze. Bahama Breeze is an underperforming business that management sees benefiting from new owners. A sale would allow them to focus on their core business and provide a substantial cash injection. The board of Fifth Third Bancorp NASDAQ: FITB reauthorized the company’s buyback plan. The existing authorization had only 11.8 shares remaining; the new one is worth 100 million and comes with no expiration. The company’s buybacks reduce the count quarterly and are compounded by a robust dividend. The yield is worth an annualized 3.45% and can be expected to grow at a mid-single-digit pace annually. Analyst trends are supporting this financial stock in July. The group of 19 tracked by MarketBeat reveals firming sentiment, a solid Moderate Buy rating, and upward pressure in the price target. The consensus forecasts a 10% upside, aligning this market with 2024’s highs, and the revision trend is leading to higher levels. Before you consider Fifth Third Bancorp, you'll want to hear this."
Why Now Could Be the Smartest Time to Buy Crypto Stocks,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/why-now-could-be-the-smartest-time-to-buy-crypto-stocks/,"With the U.S. dollar down a whopping 10.7% against peer currencies for the first half of 2023—the worst performance in more than 50 years—investors are seeking out alternative investments for either security or growth potential. Cryptocurrencies are not known for their stability, but many investors do see potential in their volatility. What's more, some (including BlackRock CEO Larry Fink) actually see the possibility of Bitcoin overtaking the U.S. dollar as the world's reserve currency. Finally, investors may watch out for secondary benefits to cryptocurrencies as the One Big Beautiful Bill raises the debt ceiling by several trillion dollars. While a direct investment in crypto is likely the most common way of gaining exposure to the space, investors seeking diversification or looking to avoid the risks of transacting with and storing tokens might also consider any number of cryptocurrency-adjacent stocks. These include companies that mine crypto, that provide infrastructure or hardware used in the industry, and so on. Interestingly, while there are reasons to buy crypto stocks related to the potential of the cryptocurrency space, one of the most successful of these firms has pivoted toward energy sales in a compelling way as well. Marathon Digital NASDAQ: MARA is one of the largest crypto mining firms in the United States, with a market value of more than $6 billion. This has allowed it to build up a massive mining fleet, with impressive results: in June, the firm won 211 Bitcoin blocks through the complex mining process, or more than 5% of all available Bitcoin rewards that month. Shares of the stock spiked on the news and are up about 6% in the last month. The firm appears poised to achieve its ambitious production upscaling goals. MARA executives have set a production target by year-end of 75 exahashes per second (a measure of computational power key to successfully mining Bitcoin). This is a full 40% higher than the hash rate achieved at the end of 2024. MARA's substantial mining power has translated into significant BTC holdings as well, as the company had nearly 48,000 BTC as of the end of June. At a value of roughly $5.2 billion, this makes up the lion's share of MARA's market value—investors should keep in mind that a crash in crypto prices could very well decimate the firm. Nonetheless, five out of 10 analysts rate MARA stock a Buy, with another four suggesting Hold. Analysts predict upside potential of more than 21% for shares, a potential boon for investors keen to access the mining industry. Like MARA, Cipher Mining Inc. NASDAQ: CIFR is primarily a Bitcoin mining operation. Its share price spike of about 47% in the last month is also likely due to its recent good news on that front. In the second quarter, Cipher outperformed its self-mining capacity guidance for its new Black Pearl site in Texas. The reported hash rate of 3.4 EH/s was well above the company's previous prediction of 2.5 EH/s. Now might be a good time for investors to join in the rally because Cipher anticipates further boosts to its hash rate in the coming months as other new mining rigs come online and the site installation is completed. This optimism is visible in the 11 Buy ratings analysts have provided CIFR shares, alongside forecasts for upside of 26%. Hut 8 NASDAQ: HUT focuses primarily on mining Bitcoin. It, too, has experienced a rally, with shares roughly doubling in price since late April. The company recently announced an expansion into regulation-friendly Dubai, a move that the company has said is about the efficiency of its capital strategy. Hut 8 is also tied with Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump via a venture called American Bitcoin Corp., which recently garnered $220 million in accredited investor support. But the primary driver of Hut's recent share price explosion may more likely be its successful deployment of its energy infrastructure outside of the cryptocurrency space. Mining firms like Hut require massive supplies of electricity for mining purposes, and the infrastructure necessary to support these activities can also be put to use for more traditional applications. Case in point, the company recently announced five-year capacity contracts for four of its natural gas-fired plants with the Ontario Independent Electricity System Operator. The contracts represent some 310 MW of power generation capacity in total. With rising energy demand and prices, pivoting in this way could prove to be highly lucrative for companies like Hut 8, and analysts think so too—HUT shares have a unanimous Buy rating from all 19 analysts, as well as 21% in upside potential.

US has reclosed its southern border after a flesh-eating parasite is seen further north in Mexico,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/us-has-reclosed-its-southern-border-after-a-flesh-eating-parasite-is-seen-further-north-in-mexico-2025-07-10/,"The U.S. has closed its southern border again to livestock imports, saying a flesh-eating parasite has moved further north in Mexico than previously reported. Mexico's president was critical Thursday, suggesting that the U.S. is exaggerating the threat to its beef industry from the parasite, the New World screwworm fly. The female flies lay eggs in wounds on warm-blooded animals, hatching larvae that are unusual among flies for feeding on live flesh and fluids instead of dead material. American officials worry that if the fly reaches Texas, its flesh-eating maggots could cause large economic losses, something that happened decades ago. The U.S. largely eradicated the pest in the 1970s by breeding and releasing sterile male flies to breed with wild females, and the fly had been contained in Panama for years until it was discovered in southern Mexico late last year. The U.S. closed its southern border in May to imports of live cattle, horses and bison but announced June 30 that it would allow three ports of entry to reopen this month and another two by Sept. 15. However, since then, an infestation from the fly has been reported 185 miles (298 kilometers) northeast of Mexico City, about 160 miles (258 kilometers) further north than previously reported cases. That was about 370 miles (595 kilometers) from the Texas border. “The United States has promised to be vigilant,” U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said in a statement Wednesday announcing the border closing. “Thanks to the aggressive monitoring by USDA staff in the U.S. and in Mexico, we have been able to take quick and decisive action to respond to the spread of this deadly pest.” In Mexico, President Claudia Sheinbaum said authorities there were following all established protocols to deal with the northernmost case. Mexican authorities said the country has 392 infected animals, down nearly 19% since June 24. “From our point of view, they took a totally exaggerated decision to closing the border again,” Sheinbaum said. “Everything that scientifically should be done is being done.” Three weeks ago, Rollins announced plans for combating the parasite that include spending nearly $30 million on new sites for breeding and dispersing sterile male flies. Once released in the wild, those males would mate with females, causing them to lay eggs that won’t hatch so that the fly population would die out. The USDA hopes a new fly factory will be operating in southern Mexico by July 2026 to supplement fly breeding at an existing complex in Panama. The agency also plans to open a site in southern Texas for holding sterile flies imported from Panama, so they can be released along the border if necessary. Also Thursday, U.S. Reps. Tony Gonzalez, of Texas, and Kat McCammack, of Florida, urged the Trump administration to quickly approve the use of existing anti-parasite treatments for New World screwworm fly infestations in livestock. They said labeling requirements currently prevent it."
Alphabet: Technical Momentum Is Starting to Turn,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/alphabet-technical-momentum-is-starting-to-turn/,"Alphabet Inc. NASDAQ: GOOGL has trailed behind its mega-cap tech peers in 2025, with shares still down 7.8% year-to-date. While the broader market, led by the technology sector and many of the Magnificent Seven members, continues to hit new highs, GOOGL has remained one of the few laggards. However, recent price action and improving technical structure suggest that the tide may be turning in favor of the bulls. Technically speaking, Alphabet stock is showing early signs of a trend reversal. Shares have now bounced more than 24% off their 52-week low, which technically puts the stock back in bull market territory. More importantly, GOOGL has reclaimed its 200-day simple moving average (SMA), a widely followed level that many consider the line between long-term uptrends and downtrends. The reclaim of the 200-day SMA, particularly following several weeks of consolidation and underperformance, could signal a significant shift in sentiment and momentum. The next key level to watch is the $180 area, which has acted as strong resistance in recent months. A decisive breakout above that level is likely to confirm a shift in the trend, opening the door for a potential upside move toward $190 and beyond. The technical picture will remain constructive as long as the stock remains above its 200-day moving average and continues to build higher lows. Despite the recent rally, GOOGL remains an underperformer in 2025 compared to notable names such as NVIDIA, Meta, and Microsoft. Much of the recent lag is attributed to concerns surrounding AI monetization, increasing regulatory pressure in both the U.S. and Europe, and growing competition in the digital advertising and cloud infrastructure sectors. Still, the company’s fundamentals remain strong. Alphabet remains the global leader in search, holds dominant positions in YouTube and Android, and is aggressively expanding its AI capabilities through Gemini and AI Overviews. Meanwhile, its Google Cloud business continues to grow steadily, providing diversification beyond ad revenue. Notably, the company has a history of operational discipline and capital efficiency. Alphabet reported solid Q1 results, beating top-line earnings expectations, and remains on track for substantial margin expansion through 2025. With nearly $100 billion in cash and cash equivalents on hand, Alphabet also has the flexibility to invest in growth, repurchase shares, or even increase its dividend yield. The point is, despite the challenges it faces, it remains in a position to deal with them head-on and from a position of strength. Looking ahead, Alphabet is set to report Q2 earnings on July 22. And while the stock hasn’t participated in the broader rally just yet, its recent technical strength heading into earnings could be a positive signal. Should the company deliver another strong report and provide upbeat forward guidance, particularly around AI initiatives, its cloud business, or advertising, it could be the catalyst GOOGL needs to break through resistance decisively. The improving chart structure, combined with strong fundamentals and low expectations relative to its peers, sets the stage for a potential catch-up trade. In a market where many tech stocks are priced for perfection, Alphabet’s historically low P/E of 19.44 and forward P/E approaching the mid-teens gives it a more reasonable entry point for investors seeking both quality and value. While Alphabet has lagged in 2025, it now finds itself in a position of growing technical strength. A 24% rebound from the lows and a reclaim of the 200-day moving average mark a notable change in trend. If GOOGL can continue to consolidate and push above the $180 resistance level, it could confirm a longer-term shift that rewards patient bulls. For investors looking for a high-quality name with improving momentum, a dominant market position, and upside potential into the second half of the year, Alphabet is one to watch closely.

White House escalates pressure campaign on Fed chair by targeting its headquarters renovation,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/white-house-budget-director-accuses-fed-chair-of-violating-building-rules-in-renovation-2025-07-10/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is escalating his pressure campaign to get the Federal Reserve chairman to either lower interest rates or quit his post by targeting the expensive renovation at the central bank’s headquarters. The latest step came Thursday when Russ Vought, Trump’s top budget adviser, sent a letter to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell saying the president is “extremely troubled” that plans may have violated government building rules with an “ostentatious overhaul.” Trump also named two close aides to an obscure commission who plan to review the Federal Reserve building plans — another avenue to increase scrutiny on Powell, whose eight-year term formally ends next May. This follows a near-daily drumbeat of criticism that Trump has leveled at Powell, whom he has disparaged as “a very stupid person” who should “resign immediately.” It’s an unprecedented attempt to reshape the Federal Reserve’s traditional role as an autonomous arbiter of U.S. monetary policy. If successful in getting Powell to leave or getting interest rates lowered, Trump will have expanded his influence to yet another corner of American government that was once seen as beyond the reach of political pressure. But he also risks jeopardizing the independence that has made the central bank a foundational player in the U.S. economy. Powell has sought to avoid politics and refrains from responding directly to the president. Fed officials did not respond to an email seeking a response to the letter, though Powell has previously said that some parts of the renovation plans have changed. Powell has so far resisted Trump’s pressure to cut rates, largely out of concern that Trump’s tariff plans could increase costs for American consumers. If rates are lowered too aggressively, it could lead to a resurgence of inflation. But Trump insists that inflation is no longer a problem, and a rate cut would help make mortgages, auto loans and other forms of consumer debt cheaper. Trump has also said it would allow the U.S. government to finance its debt more cheaply, a pressing concern as legislation signed by the president is poised to increase the federal deficit by extending tax cuts. “LOWER THE RATE!!!” Trump wrote on social media on Thursday. However, there’s no guarantee that financial markets will reduce rates on government debt even if the Fed bows to Trump’s wishes. Such a situation could lead to higher interest costs for consumers — a reminder of how monetary missteps may backfire. Powell was nominated to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors by President Barack Obama, then made chairman by Trump during his first term. But in his second term, Trump turned Powell into one of his primary antagonists. Trump has said that he wouldn’t directly oust Powell. “I don’t know why it would be so bad, but I’m not going to fire him,” he said last month. The Supreme Court said in May that it could block such a step. However, Trump's allies have found other ways to make Powell uncomfortable. Bill Pulte, the Trump-appointed director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, also accused Powell of lying to Congress about the renovations. “I am asking Congress to investigate Chairman Jerome Powell, his political bias, and his deceptive Senate testimony, which is enough to be removed ‘for cause,’” he said last week. Pulte said the situation “stinks to high heaven.” Trump's naming of James Blair, a deputy chief of staff, and Will Scharf, the staff secretary who furnishes the president with executive orders for his signature, to the National Capital Planning Commission also potentially ratchets up the pressure on Powell. Blair said he would be “requesting a review of all previous and current building plans” and suggested that Powell wasn’t honest while testifying to Congress about the renovations last month. If Powell isn’t truthful, Blair wrote on social media, “how else is the American Public to maintain confidence that its monetary policy manager is acting in their interests?” Vought, in his own letter, called the initial renovation plans featuring rooftop terrace gardens, VIP dining rooms and premium marble an “ostentatious overhaul.” Vought also suggested that Powell misled Congress by saying the headquarters had never had a serious renovation, saying that an update to its roof and building systems that was completed in 2003 counts as a “comprehensive” renovation. Powell said in Senate testimony last month that some of the elements in the 2021 plan, such as the dining rooms and rooftop terraces, are no longer part of the project for the 90-year-old Marriner S. Eccles Building. The debate over the renovation could set up a legal battle between the White House and the Fed, which under the law is allowed to use its own judgment to establish “suitable” and “adequate” quarters for its operations. Sung Won Sohn, a finance and economics professor at Loyola-Marymount University, said, “It’s good that the central bank budget is coming under review and scrutiny.” However, he warned against using such issues to challenge the Fed’s independence. If that’s compromised, he said, it’s “bad for the economy, that’s bad for inflation expectations and therefore long term inflation.” ___ Associated Press writer Fatima Hussein contributed to this report."
AI device startup that sued OpenAI and Jony Ive is now suing its own ex-employee over trade secrets,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/ai-device-startup-that-sued-openai-and-jony-ive-is-now-suing-its-own-ex-employee-over-trade-secrets-2025-07-10/,"A secretive competition to pioneer a new way of communicating with artificial intelligence chatbots is getting a messy public airing as OpenAI fights a trademark dispute over its stealth hardware collaboration with legendary iPhone designer Jony Ive. In the latest twist, tech startup iyO Inc., which already sued Ive and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman for trademark infringement, is now suing one of its own former employees for allegedly leaking a confidential drawing of iyO's unreleased product. At the heart of this bitter legal wrangling is a big idea: we shouldn't need to stare at computer or phone screens or talk to a box like Amazon's Alexa to interact with our future AI assistants in a natural way. And whoever comes up with this new AI interface could profit immensely from it. OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT, started to outline its own vision in May by buying io Products, a product and engineering company co-founded by Ive, in a deal valued at nearly $6.5 billion. Soon after, iyO sued for trademark infringement for the similar sounding name and because of the firms' past interactions. U.S. District Judge Trina Thompson ruled last month that iyO has a strong enough case to proceed to a hearing this fall. Until then, she ordered Altman, Ive and OpenAI to refrain from using the io brand, leading them to take down the web page and all mentions of the venture. A second lawsuit from iyO filed this week in San Francisco Superior Court accuses a former iyO executive, Dan Sargent, of breach of contract and misappropriation of trade secrets over his meetings with another io co-founder, Tang Yew Tan, a close Ive ally who led design of the Apple Watch. Sargent left iyO in December and now works for Apple. He and Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. “This is not an action we take lightly,” said iyO CEO Jason Rugolo in a statement Thursday. “Our primary goal here is not to target a former employee, whom we considered a friend, but to hold accountable those whom we believe preyed on him from a position of power.” Rugolo told The Associated Press last month that he thought he was on the right path in 2022 when he pitched his ideas and showed off his prototypes to firms tied to Altman and Ive. Rugolo later publicly expanded on his earbud-like “audio computer"" product in a TED Talk last year. What he didn't know was that, by 2023, Ive and Altman had begun quietly collaborating on their own AI hardware initiative. “I’m happy to compete on product, but calling it the same name, that part is just amazing to me. And it was shocking,” Rugolo said in an interview. The new venture was revealed publicly in a May video announcement, and to Rugolo about two months earlier after he had emailed Altman with an investment pitch. “thanks but im working on something competitive so will (respectfully) pass!” Altman wrote to Rugolo in March, adding in parentheses that it was called io. Altman has dismissed iyO's lawsuit on social media as a “silly, disappointing and wrong” move from a “quite persistent” Rugolo. Other executives in court documents characterized the product Rugolo was pitching as a failed one that didn't work properly in a demo. Altman said in a written declaration that he and Ive chose the name two years ago in reference to the concept of “input/output” that describes how a computer receives and transmits information. Neither io nor iyO was first to play with the phrasing — Google’s flagship annual technology showcase is called I/O — but Altman said he and Ive acquired the io.com domain name in August 2023. The idea was “to create products that go beyond traditional products and interfaces,” Altman said. “We want to create new ways for people to input their requests and new ways for them to receive helpful outputs, powered by AI.” A number of startups have already tried, and mostly failed, to build gadgetry for AI interactions. The startup Humane developed a wearable pin that you could talk to, but the product was poorly reviewed and the startup discontinued sales after HP acquired its assets earlier this year. Altman has suggested that io's version could be different. He said in a now-removed video that he's already trying a prototype at home that Ive gave him, calling it “the coolest piece of technology that the world will have ever seen.” Altman and Ive still haven't said is what exactly it is. The court case, however, has forced their team to disclose what it's not. “Its design is not yet finalized, but it is not an in-ear device, nor a wearable device,” said Tan in a court declaration that sought to distance the venture from iyO's product. It was that same declaration that led iyO to sue Sargent this week. Tan revealed in the filing that he had talked to a “now former” iyO engineer who was looking for a job because of his frustration with “iyO’s slow pace, unscalable product plans, and continued acceptance of preorders without a sellable product.” Those conversations with the unnamed employee led Tan to conclude “that iyO was basically offering ‘vaporware’ — advertising for a product that does not actually exist or function as advertised, and my instinct was to avoid meeting with iyO myself and to discourage others from doing so.” IyO said its investigators recently reached out to Sargent and confirmed he was the one who met with Tan. Rugolo told the AP he feels duped after he first pitched his idea to Altman in 2022 through the Apollo Projects, a venture capital firm started by Altman and his brothers. Rugolo said he demonstrated his products and the firm politely declined, with the explanation that they don’t do consumer hardware investments. That same year, Rugolo also pitched the same idea to Ive through LoveFrom, the San Francisco design firm started by Ive after his 27-year career at Apple. Ive's firm also declined. “I feel kind of stupid now,” Rugolo added. “Because we talked for so long. I met with them so many times and demo'd all their people — at least seven people there. Met with them in person a bunch of times, talking about all our ideas.” ———————- The Associated Press and OpenAI have a licensing and technology agreement that allows OpenAI access to part of AP’s text archives."
Senate Republicans block attempt to roll back massive tax hike on professional gamblers,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/senate-republicans-block-attempt-to-roll-back-massive-tax-hike-on-professional-gamblers-2025-07-10/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate Republicans on Thursday blocked an attempt to reverse a little-noticed provision from their tax and spending cuts law that professional gamblers warn could be the end of their industry. Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada sought unanimous passage of a bill that would roll back the change on gambling tax deductions, but Republican Sen. Todd Young of Indiana objected, stalling the proposal for now. The emerging fight over the gambling provision is likely only the beginning of the fallout from the new tax law and its impact on the country. Spanning more than 900 pages, the bill signed into law by President Donald Trump last week contained a slew of provisions changing federal programs and the tax code, many of which lawmakers admit they are only now beginning to fully digest. “My understanding is many Republicans, many Democrats did not even know it was part of that process,” Cortez Masto said of the gambling provision. Under the new tax law, starting in 2026, individuals can only deduct 90% of their gambling losses up to the amount of their winnings. That’s a change from the previous rule, which allowed gamblers to deduct 100% of their losses, up to the amount they won. The change will only significantly impact those who gamble larger amounts and who take the extra steps to itemize and deduct their losses. But for those individuals, the impact could be steep. In practice, for example, under the old rule, someone who wins $100,000 and loses $100,000 could deduct the full $100,000 in losses and owe nothing. Under the new rule, they would only be able to deduct $90,000 and would still owe taxes on the remaining $10,000, despite having lost all their winnings. “This new amendment to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act would end professional gambling in the U.S. and hurt casual gamblers, too,” Phil Galfond, a professional poker player, said on social media just days ahead of the bill's final passage. The provision was included in the bill's text released on June 16 by Senate Finance Committee Chair Mike Crapo. Some senators have said they weren't aware of the provision, and it only publicly came to light days ahead of the bill's passage, with professional gamblers and media figures drawing attention to it. “Now I see Republican senators walking all over the Capitol saying they didn’t even know anything about this policy,"" said Sen. Ron Wyden, the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. “The fact is, when you rush a process like this, this way, and cram in all of these policies that you haven’t really thought about, you risk consequences for people back home. That is what is going on here,” Wyden. said The provision is estimated to generate over $1.1 billion in tax revenue over eight years. The entirety of the tax break and spending cuts bill will increase the deficit by nearly $3.3 trillion from 2025 to 2034, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Republicans say it was a necessary procedural change tied to the reconciliation process, which allowed them to pass the sweeping bill without Democratic support. Young, the Indiana Republican who objected to Cortez Masto’s bill, said he supports the policy but would only agree to undo it if Democrats accepted other provisions in return. “I strongly support the underlying bill, but will have to object unless you can agree to my request,” Young said on the Senate floor. Thursday's attempt by Cortez Masto won't be the last. On Wednesday, she introduced a bill that will first have to go through committee, but has bipartisan support, to restore the full gambling deduction. In the House, Nevada Democratic Rep.

"Ford recalls over 850,000 cars in the US due to potential fuel pump failure",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/ford-recalls-over-850000-cars-in-the-us-due-to-potential-fuel-pump-failure-2025-07-10/,"NEW YORK (AP) — Ford is recalling more than 850,000 of its cars across the U.S. because the low-pressure fuel pump inside the vehicles may fail — and potentially cause an engine stall while driving, increasing crash risks. The recall covers a wide range of Ford and Lincoln-branded vehicles made in recent model years. That includes certain Ford Broncos, Explorers and F-150s, as well as Lincoln Aviators and Navigators, documents published this week by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration note. Ford plans to send out notification letters to affected owners starting this Monday (July 14), to warn of safety risks related to potential fuel pump failure. But a remedy is still “under development,” the NHTSA's recall report notes. It wasn't immediately clear if there was an estimate for when a fix would become available. But this week's recall report noted that owners will receive an additional letter with instructions to take their car to an authorized dealer for that service when the time comes — and that there will be no charge. The Associated Press reached out to Ford for further comments Thursday. The Michigan-based automaker isn't aware of any accidents or injuries related to this recall, this week's report notes. But owners should look out for potential warnings. Prior to fuel pump failure, customers may encounter poor engine performance, for example, a check engine light or a decrease in engine power. Fuel pump failure is “more likely to occur” during warm weather or if there’s low fuel in the tank, the recall report notes. And loss of fuel pressure and flow can be caused by internal contamination of a car’s jet pump, amid other factors. Ford also identified supplier changes during a review of the manufacturing process, the report adds. Ford estimates that 10% of the 850,318 vehicles it's recalling in the U.S. have this fuel pump risk. The recall covers certain Ford Broncos, Explorers and Lincoln Aviators between the 2021 and 2023 model years, in addition to 2021-2023 model year F-250 SD, F-350 SD, F-450 SD and F-550 SD vehicles. Select 2021-2022 Lincoln Navigators, Ford Mustangs and F-150s are also impacted, as well as some 2022 Expeditions."
"Nebius Group: Up 385%, Analysts Say It’s Still a Bargain",https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/nebius-group-up-385-analysts-say-its-still-a-bargain/,"The search for the next impactful name in artificial intelligence (AI) often leads investors to crowded fields. Yet, quietly capturing a significant market share is Nebius Group N.V. NASDAQ: NBIS. This international AI cloud provider delivered a staggering 385% year-over-year revenue growth in its latest quarter. This narrative of rapid expansion becomes even more compelling when you consider that the company is backed by a Buy consensus rating from Wall Street analysts, who see a clear path to significant upside, suggesting the market has yet to fully price in the company's potential. Nebius Group’s financial performance paints a clear picture of potent market demand. For the first quarter of 2025, the company reported revenues of $55.3 million (up 385% from last year). This growth was driven by its core business of providing the specialized infrastructure that companies desperately need to build and run sophisticated AI models. For investors, top-line growth is compelling, but predictable revenue is even better. This is where Nebius’s Annualized Recurring Revenue (ARR) becomes a critical indicator. ARR, which measures predictable income from subscriptions, soared to $310 million by April 2025. This metric is highly valued because it signifies a stable and growing base of loyal customers, giving strong credibility to management’s full-year revenue guidance of $500 million to $700 million. Of course, rapid growth often comes at the cost of profitability. However, Nebius has provided a clear catalyst for investors to watch. Management has confidently guided that it expects to reach adjusted EBITDA break-even in the second half of 2025. Achieving this milestone would be a significant de-risking event for the stock, demonstrating that the underlying business model is fundamentally sound and can generate profits even as it continues to invest in scaling its operations. In a market dominated by cloud titans, Nebius thrives not by competing head-on, but by specializing. The company has engineered a competitive advantage through its full-stack platform. This means it controls the entire technology pipeline, from designing its server hardware to writing the proprietary software that manages it. This integration enables a level of optimization that general-purpose clouds using off-the-shelf components cannot easily achieve. The problem Nebius solves is specific. AI models require massive amounts of data to be processed simultaneously across thousands of computer chips. A general-purpose cloud can create bottlenecks, slowing down training and increasing costs. The Nebius platform is purpose-built to handle these intensive, parallel workloads with maximum efficiency. This technical expertise is validated by its key industry partnerships. As a launch partner for NVIDIA’s NASDAQ: NVDA latest chips, Nebius ensures its clients get early access to the most powerful AI hardware available, creating a significant advantage in a fast-moving industry. This focus is further sharpened by strategic decisions, such as the recent deconsolidation of its Toloka data unit, which enables the company to concentrate all its resources on its core, high-margin AI infrastructure business. An ambitious vision requires the capital to make it a reality. Nebius recently secured its financial future with a $1 billion convertible note offering. Convertible notes are a hybrid security that starts as debt but can convert into stock later, a method often used by growth companies to raise capital with less immediate dilution to existing shareholders. This billion-dollar war chest ensures Nebius has the funding to aggressively expand its data center footprint and acquire the compute power needed to meet customer demand, directly fueling its future revenue. Beyond capital, Nebius has attracted validation from the highest levels of the tech world. A recent strategic investment in its Toloka business was led by Bezos Expeditions, the personal investment firm of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. This kind of smart money validation provides far more than just cash; it confers immense credibility. The association with a name like Bezos signals a strong belief in the company's technology and long-term vision, which can attract other top-tier investors, partners, and talent. The ultimate question for investors is what a stock is worth. While Nebius is not yet profitable by standard accounting, Wall Street is looking ahead. All six analysts covering the company rate the stock a Buy, reflecting a strong consensus among professionals that its future is bright. This optimism is reflected in their price targets. The average twelve-month forecast for Nebius is $66.50 per share, which represents a potential upside of over 40% from its current price. The highest target is set at $84.00, suggesting that some analysts believe the growth potential is even greater. For a hyper-growth company, valuation is often less about past performance and more about future potential. Analysts are signaling that as Nebius continues to execute on its growth plan and reaches its profitability goals, its stock price will be rerated higher to match its standing as a critical player in the AI ecosystem. Nebius Group is charting a compelling course in the competitive AI landscape. With verifiable hyper-growth, a differentiated technology stack, and the strong backing of both Wall Street and elite investors, the company presents a clear, data-driven case for investors seeking a focused, high-potential play on the future of artificial intelligence.

Boeing's Rebound Is Well Underway—But Is It Too Late?,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/boeings-rebound-is-well-underwaybut-is-it-too-late/,"Boeing NYSE: BA has been one of the most maligned titans of industry in the United States over the past several years. As of the July 8 close, the stock’s five-year total return was only 22%. The aerospace stock has massively underperformed the market, as the S&P 500 Index’s return was approximately 112% over this period. Boeing stock started 2025 off in a bad way, with shares falling to depths of -23% through early April. However, the company managed to completely flip the script as the year progressed. As of the June 8 close, Boeing stock is now up 23% in 2025, far outpacing the approximately 6% return of the S&P 500. This strong stock market performance accompanies the big improvement in the firm’s operational success, which it just made clear to the public. Now, the question is whether Boeing’s recent success is sustainable, or is it too late for the company to regain its former glory? Let’s break down the latest news around the company to form an outlook on the stock. On July 8, Boeing announced massive improvements in its plane deliveries compared to a year ago. The company said it delivered 60 commercial planes in June, marking a 27% increase in deliveries compared to the same period a year ago. Through the first half of 2025, the company’s commercial plane deliveries came in at 280. That is a 60% increase versus the first half of 2024. The company’s Defense, Space, and Security deliveries have improved significantly as well, coming in at 62. That is a nearly 48% increase from 42 in the first half of 2024. Crystalizing the improvement in the firm’s operations is the fact that its deliveries in June were the highest since December 2023. Deliveries are a very important metric in assessing the competitiveness of Boeing versus its rival Airbus Group OTCMKTS: EADSY. Planes are costly and take a long time to build. Thus, customers must have confidence that Boeing will deliver in a timely fashion to win orders over Airbus. Airbus is still winning the battle in 2025, delivering 306 planes through the first half of the year and 63 in June. However, Boeing is gaining ground. While its deliveries have skyrocketed compared to 2024, Airbus’s deliveries fell by around 5.6%. However, more important than timely delivery is the perception that Boeing’s planes are safe. This has been the bane of Boeing’s existence over the past several years and is the main thing it needs to change. The June 12 Air India crash of the company’s 787 Dreamliner is just the latest setback to the company’s efforts to promote its perception of safety. So far, no clear blame has fallen on Boeing. Authorities will likely release the details of the preliminary investigation soon. Regulators finding Boeing at fault would be a clear catalyst for shares to move down. The crash came at a particularly bad time for Boeing. The firm retreated into the shadows during the Paris Air Show, while Airbus raked in $21 billion in orders. The company has made efforts to improve the safety of its planes. It hired a new Chief Executive Officer back in August 2024 to help shift the company’s culture. It is also working to complete the purchase of key supplier Spirit AeroSystems NYSE: SPR to improve its quality control. Notably, airline executives have expressed confidence in the safety and quality improvements Boeing is making. Still, it will take years to assess whether Boeing’s safety issues are truly behind them. One saving grace for Boeing is its massive backlog, which stood at 5,953 planes at the end of June. At its current delivery pace, it would take the firm more than a decade to fulfill all these orders. Despite its issues, the demand for the company’s products remains strong, giving Boeing a big opportunity to succeed going forward if it can show that its house is in order. This means that the recovery Boeing is currently seeing is not too little, too late. However, the company still has a huge amount to prove. If Boeing’s execution continues to improve, the stock has the ability to appreciate strongly over the coming years. For perspective, the stock would need to gain approximately 51% to reclaim the all-time high it achieved in March 2019. Before you consider Boeing, you'll want to hear this."
Woman convicted of stowing away on flight to Paris faces extradition to Connecticut,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/woman-convicted-of-stowing-away-on-flight-to-paris-faces-extradition-to-connecticut-2025-07-10/,"NEW YORK (AP) — A woman convicted of stowing away on a flight from New York to Paris without a boarding pass or a passport won’t be released from custody as she faces new charges of breaching security at a Connecticut airport. Svetlana Dali was sentenced Thursday to time already served for her illegal ride to Paris last year. But a federal judge in Brooklyn said she would not be released as Connecticut authorities are seeking to extradite her to face felony charges that could have her serving up to five years behind bars if convicted. The 57-year-old, who is originally from Russia but has a green card, has been held in a federal lockup in Brooklyn for roughly seven months. Connecticut State Police confirmed after the hearing that they have an active arrest warrant against Dali, but, in an emailed statement, said release of any further information would be “dependent on an arrest being made"" in Connecticut. During her sentencing Thursday, Dali spoke for more than half an hour, repeating in detail her claim that she believes she is being poisoned by unknown persons. She pleaded with the judge to order medical tests to prove her fears, which she said had prompted her to attempt to flee the country by boarding the Paris flight illegally. “All of these actions were taken in order to save my life,” Dali said in Russian through a translator. Prosecutors say that on Nov. 24, 2024, Dali was able to get through security checkpoints at Bradley International Airport near Hartford, Connecticut, by hiding among other passengers. She wasn’t able to board a plane, but two days later, she successfully evaded security at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York and boarded a plane bound for Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris. Prosecutors said Dali was initially rebuffed by a Transportation Security Administration official when she was unable to produce a boarding pass. But she was able to get through a special security lane for airline employees by joining a large flight crew for Air Europa as they were screened and patted down. At the gate for the Paris flight, surveillance video showed Dali sneaking past Delta Air Lines staff checking tickets by again blending into a large group of passengers. On the plane, prosecutors say Dali hid in a bathroom for hours and wasn’t discovered by Delta crew members until the plane was nearing Paris. During her trial, Dali took the stand in her defense, maintaining she was never asked to show her boarding pass at the gate in JFK and had gone into the airplane bathroom because she was feeling sick. She was initially released after her arrest, but was apprehended in Buffalo, New York, after authorities said she cut off her electronic monitor and attempted to enter Canada. Prosecutors have said Dali also appears to have flown into Miami International Airport illegally. In February 2024, U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents discovered her hiding in a bathroom in a secured area in the international arrivals zone. Before you consider Delta Air Lines, you'll want to hear this."
