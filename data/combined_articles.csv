The next leg of growth is expected from building simple, scalable and secure platforms for MSMEs and enterprises. In addition to the earlier announced Jio AI Cloud, the company announced two new features this AGM- Jio PC and Jio Frames. The first enables converting any TV or screen into AI-ready computer by plugging a keyboard into Jio Set-Top Box. The latter is an AI powered wearable platform and ecosystem and enables clicking photos and recording videos. It aims to list Jio in H1CY26 subject to necessary approvals.

In absence of further details, we have valued its New Energy segment at 2x its stated capex of Rs 750bn, valuing it at Rs111/share. However, New Energy segment faces 1) overcapacity and ability of the Chinese to crash prices, 2) rapid changes in technologies, 3) tight control of Chinese over the supply-chain, and 4) lack of ecosystem in the country. We have also highlighted in our thematic note the difficulties faced by non-Chinese companies in this segment, which has seen ten large size bankruptcies in 2024 alone. We use SOTP to value the company at Rs 1,555 (unchanged). The stock has corrected by 7% since our last note. Due to the same, we upgrade the stock to BUY from Accumulate.

JKCE has a rather cogent roadmap to achieve its 50mtpa target by 2030. First off, it recently announced a 7mtpa project in Jaisalmer which, in conjunction with projects in-hand, should catapult capacity to 38mtpa by Q2FY28 (24mtpa in FY25). Complementing this, the low-hanging brownfield expansion potential (to add 12mtpa) shall make the remaining job that much easier while increased cashflow may support project execution simultaneously. This setting is reminiscent of Shree Cement (SRCM), which in its high-growth years (FY14–18) commanded premium valuation of an average 22x EV/EBITDA. Outlook JKCE is set to tread a robust growth path with low-cost expansions guarding its industry-superior RoE along the way. Jaisalmer’s greenfield project is pegged to cost a mere USD 78/t (special incentive package to boost returns further); other brownfield expansions should cost USD 60/t. The clear path to high-quality growth is reminiscent of SRCM, which in its high-growth years commanded a valuation multiple of 22x EV/EBITDA. Drawing confidence from JKCE’s proven project execution prowess, its robust volume ramp-up, and disciplined approach to leverage, we now value the stock at 22x FY27E EV/EBITDA (being SRCM’s FY14–18 average).

Sensex gained over 300 points (0.4 percent) to hover near 80,100, while Nifty 50 rose over 100 points (0.4 percent) to reclaim the 24,500-mark. The broader market indices also recorded strong gains, with the smallcap and midcap indices rising around 1 percent each. All sectoral indices, expect FMCG, were trading in the green, with IT stocks leading in gains. Here are the key factors behind the uptrend in Indian stock markets today: Strong Q1 GDP numbers: Indian economy grew 7.8 percent in the April-June quarter of the ongoing financial year. This is the highest growth recorded in five consecutive quarters, beating economists' estimates. Gross domestic product (GDP) topped both the RBI's 6.5 percent projection and the 6.6 percent median recorded in a Moneycontrol poll. The GDP growth was also stronger than the 7.4 percent rate recorded in the preceding three months (Q4 FY25) and 6.5 percent recorded a year earlier (Q1 FY25). ""The key driver for this upbeat opening is India’s strong GDP data, which has boosted investor confidence and supported sentiment across sectors. Backed by healthy economic momentum and stable global cues, the market is set to begin on a firm note, though moves may turn stock-specific as the day progresses,"" said Mandar Bhojane, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst - Research at Choice Equity Broking Private Limited. Optimism over PM Modi attending SCO Summit in China: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is currently attending the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Tianjin, China. At the summit, he has met Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin. This holds strong significance in global geopolitics after US President Donald Trump's administration increased tariffs on Indian imports to a whopping 50 percent. Additionally, the cooling tensions between India and China also may have boosted the markets. ""Global geopolitics is transforming fast in response to Trump’s tantrums. The coming together of China, India and Russia can have profound consequences on global power equations and thereby on global trade. This will have its impact on the stock market too,"" said VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited. US court rules Trump tariffs illegal: A US appeals court last week ruled that most of Donald Trump's tariffs are illegal. The court has allowed the tariffs to remain effective till October 14, giving the Trump administration time to file an appeal with the US Supreme Court. Trump has criticized the move, saying, ""If these Tariffs ever went away, it would be a total disaster for the Country."" The court ruling may have also provided some relief to the Indian stock markets, which earlier fell sharply after the additional tariffs took effect. VK Vijayakumar noted that the US court ruling on Trump's tariffs is a big development, and investors will await the final verdict by the US Supreme Court on the issue. Value buying: After three days of fall, investors may have resorted to value buying now. Sensex dropped more than 1,800 points (over 2 percent) to fall below the 80,000 mark, while Nifty 50 fell 541 points (over 2 percent) to fall below the 24,500-mark between August 26 and August 29. ""The Nifty 50 is trading below its 100-DEMA, showing a weak trend with risks of further downside if 24,350 breaks. Key supports are at 24,350 and 24,150, while resistance lies at 24,600–24,800. Traders are advised to stay cautious, avoid aggressive positions, and consider buying near 24,350 with a stop-loss at 24,280 and profit booking around 24,700–24,800,"" said Mandar Bhojane, while explaining the technical side of the benchmark index. India Vix, which measures volatility in the markets, also dropped more than 1.5 percent to 11.57 in the morning trading hours of September 1. IT stocks lead gains: IT stocks rose 1.3 percent after data showed the US Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) rose in line with estimates, keeping alive the expectations of a rate cut in September. The Federal Reserve tracks the PCE price measures for its 2 percent inflation target. Lower interest rates in the US make emerging markets such as India more attractive for foreign investors. All 10 constituents of the Nifty IT index traded in positive territory, with Mphasis leading the pack. The surge followed Morgan Stanley’s overweight rating on the stock, along with a revised target price of Rs 3,625 per share, up from Rs 3,500 earlier. GST reforms expectations: The GST Council, chaired by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, is slated to meet in New Delhi on September 3-4 to deliberate on the Centre's proposal for a simplified two-rate structure of 5 percent and 18 percent. According to market experts, this will likely act as a strong boost for several sectors. ""The proposed GST reforms can accelerate growth in the coming quarters. This, along with the huge liquidity coming into mutual funds will continue to support the market,"" VK Vijayakumar said.

"Sterlite Tech shares lower after US court affirms $96.5 million order in non-compete breach, company plans to appeal",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sterlite-tech-shares-lower-after-us-court-affirms-96-5-million-order-in-non-compete-breach-company-plans-to-appeal-13506167.html,"Optical fiber cables company Sterlite Tech's shares were sharply lower in early trade on September 1, down by over 3 percent, after an exchange filing said an American company - Prysmian Cables - has filed a lawsuit against STL's US subsidiary over breach of non-compete and confidentiality agreements. Prysmian Cables and Systems USA, LLC sued the company and Stephen Szymanski, an employee of Sterlite Tech Inc over violation of 'certain non-compete and confidentiality agreements', which have provided Sterlite Tech with an 'alleged unjust competitive advantage', an exchange filing said. Sterlite Tech has denied these allegations, and said the company is 'not a party to this dispute and no claims have been made against STL'. A South Carolina jury had awarded $200,000 against Szymanski and $96.5 million against Sterlite Tech, and the Court affirmed the verdict on August 29, 2025, but denied pre-judgment interest. A pre-judgment interest refers to any compensation to the winning side in a lawsuit for the loss of the use of money between the date of the final judgment, and the claim becoming due. ""On August 9, 2024, following a three week trial, a Jury returned a verdict of $200,000 against Szymanski and USD 96.5 million against STI. On August 29, 2025, the Court affirmed the verdict but denied Plaintiff’s post-trial motion for pre-judgment interest,"" the company informed. Sterlite Tech has disputed the ruling and intends to appeal the verdict. The judgment is 'unsupported by the testimony and evidence presented at trial' said Sterlite Tech. The company intends to 'vigorously pursue all available post-trial remedies, including an appeal', the statement said. ""Matter is sub-judice and given STI intends to file an appeal, the ultimate financial implications, if any, will be assessed on the ultimate resolution of the matter,"" Sterlite Tech added. Having recovered from early lows, the shares of Sterlite Tech are sharply down in the trading session. On a YTD basis, shares of STL are down by over 4 percent, and lower by 16 percent over past one year."
IT stocks shine as strong GDP data lifts sentiment; Mphasis leads on Morgan Stanley's upgrade,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/it-stocks-shine-as-strong-gdp-data-lifts-sentiment-mphasis-leads-on-morgan-stanley-s-upgrade-13505997.html,"IT stocks took the spotlight on September 1, as shares of major players including Mphasis, Coforge, Infosys, Tech Mahindra, Persistent Systems, TCS, and Wipro gained between 1 percent and 2 percent. The rally came after India’s GDP grew 7.8 percent in the June quarter, lifting overall market sentiment on Dalal Street. All 10 constituents of the Nifty IT index traded in positive territory, with Mphasis leading the pack. The surge followed Morgan Stanley’s overweight rating on the stock, along with a revised target price of Rs 3,625 per share, up from Rs 3,500 earlier. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog Analysts believe micro factors are aligning in favor of Mphasis, and any macro support from interest rate cuts would provide additional tailwinds for growth. Morgan Stanley expects Mphasis to narrow its valuation gap with mid-cap peers as revenue growth picks up. The IT pack has been on investors’ radar in recent days after US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell hinted at possible monetary easing. Powell suggested that the weak US job market could push the Fed to cut interest rates as early as its September 16–17 meeting. Brokerages remain optimistic about the sector. Analysts at CLSA have maintained a bullish stance, citing strong US economic growth and signs of a revival in discretionary IT spending. They also highlighted that IT valuations remain attractive historically and relative to benchmarks such as the Nifty and Nasdaq, offering downside protection. CLSA identified Infosys and Wipro as its top picks, rating them ‘Outperform’ and noting their high beta characteristics.

Based on Friday’s close, this works out to Rs 18,347 crore.

The solar power solutions provider entered the market on September 3 last year with one of the standout listings of 2023, opening at more than double its issue price of Rs 450. The stock quickly surged to an all-time high of Rs 1,388, before giving up some gains. As of June 2025, promoters hold 64.25 percent in Premier Energies.

The brokerage hosted Suzlon’s Group CEO J.P. Chalasani, who reaffirmed his long-term commitment to the company, noting that his role carried no defined sunset clause and was driven by the goal of scaling up the business. He also said the appointment of a new CFO is in its final stages. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Motilal Oswal said government efforts to reduce import dependence through the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) in wind turbine manufacturing could be transformative, positioning India as a global hub while boosting domestic supply chains. The brokerage highlighted that more clarity is awaited on how localisation will be defined and implemented, but said Suzlon’s domestic readiness gives it a clear edge over overseas competitors. It added that the company plans to enter global markets, with export orders expected by FY26 and deliveries from the second half of FY27, targeting Europe and the Middle East. Suzlon, the brokerage noted, is uniquely positioned with its in-house R&D, design, and prototype testing facilities, giving it a head start over global rivals who may face long lead times in adapting to localisation rules. While further clarity is awaited on the scope of the localisation order and standard operating procedures, Motilal Oswal believes Suzlon has structural advantages that can translate into market share gains. Beyond India, the company is preparing to re-enter export markets, with orders expected by FY26 and supplies beginning in the second half of FY27. Europe and the Middle East are the first focus geographies, though the U.S. remains uncertain due to tariffs. Importantly, Suzlon plans to stick to equipment supply in global markets, avoiding execution risks tied to EPC contracts. On valuations, Motilal Oswal applied a target P/E of 35x FY27 earnings, slightly above Suzlon’s historical average, citing strong execution visibility, policy support, and an expanding order book. ""SUEL remains well-positioned to capture growth opportunities,"" the brokerage said. At about 9:45 am, shares of the company were trading at Rs xx, higher by xx percent from the last closing price.

The broader market, represented by the mid and smallcap indices, also mirrored positive trends to snap their three and six-day losing streak. At about 9:25 am, the Sensex was up 330.87 points or 0.41 percent at 80,140.52, and the Nifty was up 99.30 points or 0.41 percent at 24,526.15. About 2175 shares advanced, 793 shares declined, and 150 shares were unchanged. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates The growing alignment of China, India, and Russia carrying potential to reshape power dynamics and trade flows worldwide—moves that will inevitably ripple into markets. Two key developments stand out for investors. Globally, a U.S. court has ruled Trump’s tariffs illegal, though the Supreme Court’s final word is awaited. On the domestic front, India’s Q1 GDP growth surprised at 7.8 percent, aided by earlier fiscal and monetary measures whose effects are now showing up. Planned GST reforms could further lift growth in the coming quarters, while strong mutual fund inflows and abundant liquidity remain supportive for equities. Among individual stocks, Reliance Industries shares were in focus after its 48th AGM, where the big highlight was a plan to list Jio by June 2026. JPMorgan, with an ‘Overweight’ and a Rs 1,695 target, noted that Jio is already fairly valued but said higher telecom tariffs before the listing could lift sentiment. Reliance plans to launch Jio’s IPO in the first half of 2026, banking on strong broadband growth and a push to sell its 5G stack overseas. Shares of Premier Energies traded flat as the one-year shareholder lock-in ends, freeing up 185.2 crore shares—41 percent of its equity—worth about Rs 18,347 crore at Friday’s close, according to Nuvama Alternative and Quantitative Research. In the past year, mutual funds have doubled their stake in Premier Energies to 8.34 percent from 4.22 percent, while foreign institutions have raised holdings from 3.08 percent to 4.41 percent. RBL Bank shares rose almost 2 percent on Monday after the lender said its board will seek shareholder approval at the 82nd AGM to raise Rs 3,500 crore via QIP and Rs 3,000 crore through debt securities in multiple tranches. Technical View Nifty’s August close on a fragile note—breaking through key support zones and slipping beneath its two-month low—nearly confirms a bearish Harami setup on the monthly chart. The dominance of call writing at crucial strikes, coupled with unwinding and migration of put positions to lower levels, reinforces the prevailing bearish sentiment. With the index trading well below all major moving averages and resistances gradually shifting lower, the structure remains vulnerable. Unless Nifty decisively clears the 24,800 zone, upside momentum will stay capped. On the downside, holding above 24,400 is critical to prevent deeper corrections. For now, a “sell-on-rise” approach appears prudent, with any technical rebounds in oversold conditions likely to be viewed as fresh shorting opportunities. Tech Mahindra, TCS, HCL Tech, Hero MotoCorp, and Asian Paints were the top gainers on the Nifty. Laggards on the index included Jio Financial Services, Hindustan Unilever, and Maruti Suzuki.

"PG Electroplast shares surge 3% as arm inks Rs 1,000 crore deal with Maharashtra govt",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/pg-electroplast-shares-surge-3-as-arm-inks-rs-1-000-crore-deal-with-maharashtra-govt-13505912.html,"Shares of PG Electroplast surged 3 percent to Rs 551 per share on September 1 after its subsidiary, Next Generation Manufacturers, entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Government of Maharashtra. The agreement entails setting up a Rs 1,000 crore greenfield consumer electronics facility at Kamargaon in Ahilyanagar. This upcoming project is part of the state’s Magnetic Maharashtra initiative and aims to develop integrated manufacturing capacities for air conditioners, washing machines, refrigerators, and related products. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog The facility is expected to generate over 5,000 direct and indirect employment opportunities, strengthening the consumer electronics ecosystem in western India. The MoU was formalised in Mumbai in the presence of Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and Industries Minister Uday Samant. PG Electroplast stated that the plant will be highly vertically integrated and help strengthen the local components ecosystem. However, the stock had been under pressure over the last month, falling nearly 30 percent compared to a 0.2 percent decline in the benchmark Nifty 50 index. This was triggered after the company revised its full-year revenue guidance downward. PG Electroplast now expects net profit for the year to be between Rs 300 crore and Rs 310 crore, reflecting a growth of 3 percent to 7 percent over the previous year. Earlier, during the March quarter, the company had projected net profit of around Rs 405 crore. The company also trimmed its product business growth expectations to 17 percent–21 percent, estimating revenue in the range of Rs 4,140 crore to Rs 4,280 crore, down from the earlier forecast of Rs 4,770 crore. Consequently, the total group revenue guidance has been lowered to between Rs 6,550 crore and Rs 6,650 crore, compared to the previous estimate of Rs 7,200 crore.

"Sensex, Nifty to snap 3-day losing streak? Key levels to track on September 1",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sensex-nifty-to-snap-3-day-losing-streak-key-levels-to-track-on-september-1-13505393.html,"Benchmark indices Nifty and Sensex are set to open slightly higher on Monday, September 1, as GIFT Nifty traded at 25,597, up 46 points or 0.2 percent, hinting at a break from the three-day losing streak. After a lukewarm start, Sensex, Nifty slipped in the last hour of trade on Friday, August 29, as auto, IT, and metal stocks outweighed support from FMCG stocks. The pressure also spilled over to the broader market, with mid- and small-cap indices trimming early gains to end lower. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Foreign investors (FIIs/FPIs) net sold Rs 8,313 crore worth of Indian equities on Friday. At the same time, domestic institutional investors (DIIs) net bought shares worth Rs 11,487 crore. Here are the key levels to watch out for in today's session Nifty’s August close on a fragile note—breaking through key support zones and slipping beneath its two-month low—nearly confirms a bearish Harami setup on the monthly chart. The dominance of call writing at crucial strikes, coupled with unwinding and migration of put positions to lower levels, reinforces the prevailing bearish sentiment. With the index trading well below all major moving averages and resistances gradually shifting lower, the structure remains vulnerable. Unless Nifty decisively clears the 24,800 zone, upside momentum will stay capped. On the downside, holding above 24,400 is critical to prevent deeper corrections. For now, a “sell-on-rise” approach appears prudent, with any technical rebounds in oversold conditions likely to be viewed as fresh shorting opportunities. ""Closing August on a weak note, Nifty Bank’s breakdown below critical support levels and a strong bearish monthly candle reinforce the dominance of sellers. The steady shift of resistance to lower levels, combined with aggressive call writing and unwinding of put positions, leaves the market structure fragile and tilted toward weakness. For the near term, a decisive move above 54,500 is essential for any sustainable recovery,"" Dhupesh Dhameja of SAMCO Securities said. ""On the downside, holding above 53,500 will be critical to prevent a deeper slide. Until then, a “sell-on-rise” strategy remains the most prudent approach, with minor rebounds in oversold conditions likely to offer fresh shorting opportunities rather than signalling any meaningful turnaround,"" he added. India VIX eased by 3.49 percent to 11.75. Despite persistent global uncertainties, the subdued VIX signals a consolidation phase rather than a panic-led selloff. The calmness in volatility reflects cautious optimism, with market participants refraining from aggressive hedging activity. The Put-Call Ratio (PCR) slipped sharply from 0.64 to 0.54, indicating elevated supply pressure. However, with PCR now deeply oversold, the possibility of a minor technical rebound cannot be ruled out.

In the latest session, the stock decisively broke out of this flag formation with a massive 431% surge in volume compared to the 50-day average, clearly indicating strong institutional participation. Such a technical setup, backed by volumes, often leads to sharp follow-through momentum, keeping CG Power well-positioned for a significant continuation of its upmove. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 950 Stop-Loss: Rs 645 CreditAccess Grameen | CMP: Rs 1,400 CreditAccess Grameen has broken out of a bullish 272-day-long cup and handle pattern, confirming a strong technical setup.

DII buying breach Rs 5 lakh crore mark for second year,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/mutual-funds/dii-buying-breach-rs-5-lakh-crore-mark-for-second-year-13504840.html,"Domestic institutional investors (DIIs) have poured more than Rs 5 lakh crore into Indian equities so far in 2025, underscoring their growing clout in cushioning markets against foreign outflows. With four months still left in the year, this is the second successive year that DIIs have breached the milestone. Provisional NSE data shows that mutual funds, banks, insurers and other domestic institutions have net purchased Rs 5.13 lakh crore worth of equities in 2025, after a record Rs 5.25 lakh crore in 2024. This comes on the back of Rs 1.81 lakh crore in 2023, followed by Rs 2.76 lakh crore in subsequent purchases that year. The surge in domestic buying has coincided with relentless selling by foreign institutional investors (FIIs), who have withdrawn over Rs 1.6 lakh crore from the secondary market this year after pulling out nearly Rs 1.21 lakh crore in 2024, according to NSDL data. Market watchers note that DII inflows have been instrumental in absorbing this selling pressure, even amid heavy promoter offloads and profit-booking by private equity funds. Yet, robust domestic flows have not translated into broad-based gains. A Bloomberg note highlighted that only 30 percent of BSE500 companies have delivered positive returns over the past year, while 70 percent ended lower — a reminder that liquidity alone cannot guarantee market breadth. Indian equities have remained volatile in 2025, with the Sensex up 2.1 percent and the Nifty ahead by 3.1 percent, even as the BSE MidCap index fell 3.9 percent and the SmallCap index slipped 6.8 percent. Analysts, however, remain optimistic on the structural shift underway. Independent market expert Ajay Bagga said domestic participation in equities is rising steadily as higher incomes and growing investment appetite set off a self-reinforcing cycle. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments, added that the market’s resilience at current levels is largely due to DII flows, which represent a longer-term trend of household savings transitioning into equity investments.

Broader indices snap 2-week gains; 15 small caps record double digit fall,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/broader-indices-snap-2-week-gains-15-small-caps-record-double-digit-fall-13504585.html,"The broader indices underperformed the main indices and snapped two-week gaining streak in the week ended August 29 with BSE Small and Mid-cap indices falling 3 percent each, while Large-cap index shed 2 percent. For the week, the BSE Sensex index shed 1,497.2 points or 1.84 percent to close at 79,809.65 and Nifty50 lost 443.25 points or 1.78 percent to end at 24,426.85. However, in the month of August, Sensex fell 1.7 percent, and Nifty index was down 1.4 percent. The Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) extended their selling on 9th consecutive week, as they sold equities worth Rs 21,151.90 crore. On the other hand, Domestic Institutional Investors (DII) continued their buying in 20th consecutive week, as they bought equities worth Rs 28,645.04 crore. In this month of August, FII offloaded equities worth Rs 46,902.92 crore and DII bought equities worth Rs 94,828.55 crore. On the sectoral front, Nifty Realty index shed more than 4 percent, Nifty Defence index fell 4 percent, Nifty PSU Bank index shed 3.5 percent, Nifty Oil & Gas index slipped 3 percent. On the other hand, Nifty FMCG index added 0.7 percent. ""In the last week, the benchmark indices witnessed selling pressure at higher levels. The Nifty ended 1.8 percent lower, while the Sensex declined by 1500 points. Among sectors, the Capital Market Index lost the most, declining by 7.5 percent, whereas some buying was seen in selective FMCG stocks, resulting in the FMCG Index gaining 0.67 percent. Technically, on weekly charts, it has formed a long bearish candle and also a lower top formation, which is largely negative,"" said Amol Athawale, VP technical Research, Kotak Securities. ""We are of the view that the market's short-term outlook remains weak, but a fresh selloff is possible only if the level of 24,330/79700 is breached. On the other hand, above 24,550/80500, the pullback rally could continue up to the 20-day SMA (Simple Moving Average) or 24,700/81000 and 24,800/81300,"" he added. ""On the downside, if the market falls below 24,330/79700, it could slip to the 200-day SMA or around 24,070/78900. Further downside may also continue, which could drag the market down to 23,900/78400."" ""For Bank Nifty, if it sustains above 53,500, a pullback move is likely to continue toward 54,500–55,000–55,800. Conversely, if it falls below 53,500, it could decline toward the 200-day SMA or around 53,000–52,800,"" Athawale added further. The BSE Small-cap index shed 3 percent with Blue Jet Healthcare, Vishnu Prakash R Punglia, Angel One, Sterlite Technologies, Panama Petrochem, Ethos, Shankara Building Products, Shiva Cement, Sai Life Sciences, Nelcast, Technocraft Industries (India), Gokaldas Exports, GOCL Corporation, Faze Three, Ramky Infrastructure falling between 10-13%. On the other hand, Sadhana Nitrochem, Kabra Extrusion Technik, Rattanindia Enterprises, Permanent Magnets, Jindal Poly Films, Timex Group India, Edelweiss Financial Services, Advanced Enzyme Technologies, Apollo Micro Systems, Kolte-Patil Developers, S H Kelkar & Company, Seamec added between 10-21%. Where is Nifty50 headed? Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking The ongoing decline appears to be more sentiment-driven in the absence of fresh positive triggers. Notably, the Nifty is now approaching a critical support zone at 24,250–24,350. Meanwhile, the banking index has almost tested its major support around the 200 DEMA at 53,600, which could prompt some pause or even a rebound. That said, participants should continue to adopt a cautious approach, with greater emphasis on risk management, until there are clear signs of a consolidation. Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities The downside momentum continued in the market on Friday and Nifty closed the day lower by 74 points amidst choppy movement. A small negative candle was formed on the daily chart with long upper shadow. Technically, this market action indicates weak bounce and sell on rise in the market. Hence, one may expect some more weakness in the coming week. Nifty is nearing a crucial lower support around 24300-24200 levels (previous swing low and 200day EMA), but a sustainability above the said supports could be doubtful. Hence, a decisive move below 24200, the Nifty could slide down to the next lows of around 24000-23900 levels in the near term. However, a strong upside momentum above the hurdle of 24700 could change the sentiment in favor of bulls. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The RSI is in a bearish crossover, indicating sustained weakness. In the short term, the trend may remain weak, potentially dragging Nifty towards the 200 DMA placed at 24,071. On the lower end, support is placed at 24,400/24,150, while on the higher end, resistance is seen at 24,650. A “sell on rise” strategy remains preferable as long as the index stays below 24,850.

SEBI directs Katalyst Software to refund NCD investors with 15% interest,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sebi-directs-katalyst-software-to-refund-ncd-investors-with-15-interest-13503284.html,"The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has directed Katalyst Software Services Ltd. (KSSL) to refund funds raised through non-convertible debentures (NCDs) issued in 2017-18, along with 15 percent annual interest, after finding violations in the debt issuance process. In a 55-page order, Sebi’s Quasi-Judicial Authority, Santosh Shukla, in his order said, KSSL had mobilised funds through NCDs purportedly issued as a private placement to Karvy Capital Ltd., but the securities were later transferred to more than 200 investors, effectively making it a public offer. The regulator held that the company bypassed disclosure and compliance requirements mandated under the Companies Act and SEBI’s debt regulations. SEBI’s directions: Sebi directed that KSSL must refund investors the money collected via NCDs in FY 2017-18, together with 15 percent per annum interest from the eighth day of collection till actual repayment. Also, the company must publish a notice in all editions of two national dailies (one English and one Hindi) and in a widely circulated local newspaper, within 15 days, detailing the modalities for repayment and providing contact details for investor queries. Sebi said, mode of refunds, including principal and interest, must be made only via verifiable banking channels such as demand drafts, pay orders, or electronic fund transfers, ensuring a clear audit trail to identify beneficiaries. Sebi also barred the former promoter, Rahul Dilip Shah, for six months from accessing the securities market. Sebi order said, Shah is directed not to, directly or indirectly, access the securities market, by issuing prospectus, offer document and is restrained from soliciting money from the public in contravention of law, directly or indirectly and is restrained and prohibited from buying, selling or otherwise dealing in the securities market, directly or indirectly in any manner whatsoever, for a period of six months from the date of this order The order comes in the wake of a complaint by former promoter Rahul Dilip Shah, who had alleged irregularities in the pledge of his shares and collusion between Karvy and the majority shareholder group. Sebi’s probe into the NCD issuance established that investor funds were raised in a manner that circumvented regulatory safeguards."
"Sebi passes order against Sanjay Dalmia and others in Golden Tobacco case, imposes penalty and bars from market",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sebi-passes-order-against-sanjay-dalmia-and-others-in-golden-tobacco-case-imposes-penalty-and-bars-from-market-13503040.html,"The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has passed a fresh order in the case of Golden Tobacco Limited (GTL), alleging fund diversion and misstatement of financials over the years. The order, issued on Friday, comes after a detailed investigation into alleged diversion of assets, misstatements and lapses in disclosures by the company and its key officials. In its order, Sebi restrained Sanjay Dalmia, promoter of GTL, from accessing the securities market for a period of 2 years. The regulator also imposed a penalty of Rs 30 lakh on him for violations of the Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices (PFUTP) Regulations and the Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements (LODR) Regulations. Similarly, Anurag Dalmia, another promoter and director, has been barred from the securities market for one-and-half year and fined Rs 20 lakh. The order also names Ashok Kumar Joshi, a former director of GTL, who has been prohibited from accessing the capital markets for one year and also ordered to pay a penalty of Rs 10 lakhs . As per the Sebi order, GTL transferred Rs.175.17 crore to its subsidiary GRIL during the period FY10 to FY15 in the form of loans and advances and has been showing as outstanding in its annual reports. Sebi alleged that out of the total advance only Rs 36 crore was returned and the rest of the funds were diverted from GRIL to the promoter related entities. Sebi alleged that the promoters and directors of GTL had entered into agreements relating to the company’s prime land assets without proper disclosures to shareholders. These included arrangements with third parties for sale or lease of land that were either not executed in the company’s best interest or were not transparently disclosed to the stock exchanges. Sebi’s Quasi-Judicial Authority, N Murugan, noted in the order, “from the connection established among the promoter entities, they have been benefitted by the said diversion of funds”. He further noted that, “I also note that GTL is not a party/notice in the present proceedings. The promoter- connected entities are also not party in these proceedings. In view of this, no direction can be contemplated against GTL or the promoter connected entities”. Order noted, the funds diverted should be indirectly attributable to the shareholders. From that perspective, it can be considered as loss to the shareholders of GTL notionally GTL, once known for its cigarette brands like Panama and Chancellor, had over the years transitioned into a company with significant real estate holdings, particularly in Mumbai and Delhi. In 2022, the company was admitted into insolvency after National Company Law Tribunal, Ahmedabad ordered for commencement of Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) against the company. Sebi had previously also passed adjudication orders against Anurag Dalmia, Sanjay Dalmia in October 25, 2013 and against others in February 14, 2014."
S&P 500 ends lower as Dell and Nvidia drop,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/s-p-500-ends-lower-as-dell-and-nvidia-drop-13503047.html,"The S&P 500 ended down from record highs on Friday, with losses in Dell, Nvidia and other AI-related stocks, while investors parsed inflation data showing tariffs have started feeding into prices. Dell tumbled almost 9% and was among the deepest decliners in the S&P 500 after high manufacturing costs for AI-optimized servers and intensifying competition overshadowed the company's bullish demand forecast for artificial intelligence infrastructure. Nvidia dipped 3.4%, down for a third straight day. The AI heavyweight's quarterly report on Wednesday fell short of investors' high expectations but confirmed that spending related to artificial intelligence infrastructure remains strong. ""Today is just weakness in the top of the market, in tech,"" said Zachary Hill, head of portfolio management at Horizon Investments in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""This is not the first time that we've had some worries about over-investment in AI, lack of monetization opportunities and that type of thing."" S&P 500 components so far in 2025 U.S. consumer spending increased by the most in four months in July while services inflation picked up, but economists did not believe the signs of strong domestic demand would prevent the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates next month against a backdrop of softening labor market conditions. The report from the Commerce Department on Friday showed mild price pressures from tariffs on imports. A U.S. tariff exemption for package imports valued under $800 also ended on Friday, raising costs for businesses and, in turn, consumers. Traders widely expect the Fed will cut interest rates by 25 basis points at its September meeting. ""Even if we see an uptick in inflation, which it looks like we are, the Fed may look past that, given that this is going to be tariff-related and temporary,"" said Jim Smigiel, chief investment officer at SEI. The U.S. stock market will be closed on Monday for the Labor Day holiday. Expectations of interest rate cuts helped lead the benchmark S&P 500 and the blue-chip Dow to their fourth straight month of gains, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq logged its fifth consecutive monthly rise. U.S. shares of Alibaba soared 13% and were among the most-traded on Wall Street after the Chinese company reported stronger-than-expected quarterly growth in its cloud computing business, driven by AI-related demand. As well, the Wall Street Journal reported that Alibaba has developed a new AI chip. The S&P 500 declined 0.64% to end the session at 6,460.26 points a day after notching a record-high close. The Nasdaq declined 1.15% to 21,455.55 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.20% to 45,544.88 points. Six of the 11 S&P 500 sector indexes rose, led by healthcare, up 0.73%, followed by a 0.64% gain in consumer staples. The S&P 500 technology index fell 1.63%. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies dipped 0.5%, and it logged a 7% gain in August. For the month, the S&P 500 rose 1.9%, the Dow rose 3.2% and the Nasdaq added 1.6%. Fed Governor Christopher Waller, a candidate for the central bank's top job, said on Thursday he wants to start cutting rates next month, in line with President Donald Trump's calls to lower borrowing costs. A court hearing on Trump's attempt to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook ended on Friday with no immediate ruling from the judge hearing the unprecedented legal fight, meaning the U.S. central bank policymaker will remain in place for now. Chipmaker Marvell slumped almost 19% after forecasting quarterly revenue below expectations. Global economy bellwether Caterpillar dropped 3.65% a day after the heavy-equipment maker forecast higher tariff-related expenses for 2025.Advancing issues outnumbered falling ones within the S&P 500 by a 1.3-to-one ratio. The S&P 500 posted 21 new highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq recorded 76 new highs and 67 new lows. Volume on U.S. exchanges was relatively light, with 14.8 billion shares traded, compared to an average of 16.4 billion shares over the previous 20 sessions."
Sebi extends digital accessibility compliance timelines for investment advisors and research analysts,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sebi-extends-digital-accessibility-compliance-timelines-for-investment-advisors-and-research-analysts-13502438.html,"The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has extended compliance timelines and revised reporting requirements for investment advisors (IAs) and research analysts (RAs) under its framework on digital accessibility. The decision comes less than a month after the regulator mandated that all regulated entities align their digital platforms with the provisions of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 and related rules. In a circular issued on Friday, Sebi said that the deadlines applicable to IAs and RAs for submitting reports and completing specific obligations under the July 31 accessibility framework have been relaxed. The move is aimed at providing additional time to these entities to adapt their systems and processes, given the operational challenges raised by industry participants. Market participants had raised the issue of implementation with Moneycontrol. The deadline for submitting a compliance or action-taken report with respect to the earlier set for August 30, has now been extended to September 30, 2025. The same timeline also applies for submission of the list of digital platforms offered by entities to investors. Also read: Is Sebi revisiting F&O suitability? Recent remarks indicate entry criteria discussion is back on table and here's how it could look The appointment of IAAP-certified accessibility professionals as auditors has been extended by three months, with the new deadline now December 14, 2025. The deadline for conducting accessibility audits of digital platforms has also been pushed to April 30, 2026. Further, remediation of audit findings and ensuring compliance with the circular has been extended until July 31, 2026. The requirement to conduct annual accessibility audits of all digital platforms and submit the final report to Sebi has also been deferred by a year, with the new deadline set for April 30, 2027. The July 31 circular had laid out a phased roadmap requiring regulated entities to list all their digital platforms, appoint an Independent Accessibility Audit Professional (IAAP), conduct audits, and complete remediation to make websites and mobile applications compliant. It also mandated annual reporting on accessibility compliance and designated nodal officers for grievance redressal. Also read: Sebi panel recommends open offer process may be faster with quicker payout to investors With the latest update, Sebi has also clarified the reporting authority for IAs and RAs. The regulator has realigned the compliance submission process, shifting reporting obligations of stock brokers and depository participants to stock exchanges and depositories, of IA and RAs to BSE Limited instead of BASL and MIIs and other regulated entities to Sebi. The extension underscores Sebi’s intent to balance inclusivity with practical implementation. The revised timelines and updated reporting framework are expected to ease the compliance burden on IAs and RAs while reinforcing Sebi’s broader push for inclusive finance and investor protection."

Top gainers and losers: Stocks that moved the most on August 29,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/top-gainers-and-losers-stocks-that-moved-the-most-on-august-29-13500853.html,"The Sensex slipped 270 points on Friday to close at 79,809.65, as renewed concerns over fresh US tariffs on Indian exports dampened risk appetite and kept foreign inflows subdued. Market breadth was weak, with 12 of 16 sectoral indices closing lower, underscoring broad-based pressure. Still, there were pockets of resilience. Consumer-oriented stocks gained nearly 0.6%, supported by expectations that the upcoming GST Council meeting may bring in measures favourable to the sector. On the index front, ITC and HDFC Bank provided notable support. Defensives and financials showed some resilience, but the overall mood stayed cautious. Top GainersRBL Bank (CMP: Rs 261.05 ; up by 4.07%) RBL Bank shares went up by around 4.3% following Societe Generale's bulk purchase of 32.78 lakh shares at Rs 250.57 per share. This substantial institutional buying signaled confidence in the bank's prospects, giving a positive boost to its share price today.Thejo Engineering (CMP: Rs 1939.30 ; up by 1.01%) Thejo Engineering shares rose about 4% due to plans for manufacturing expansion and technology upgrades, which investors expect will drive capacity growth and strengthen the company's competitive position in the market.ITC Ltd (CMP: Rs 409.75 ; up by 2.21%) ITC gained over 2% today. The stock saw buying interest backed by steady domestic demand and optimism about the company’s diversified portfolio in FMCG, cigarettes, and packaged foods. ITC’s dividend yield and stable earnings outlook kept investor sentiment positive despite broader market weakness.Shriram Finance (CMP: Rs 580.25 ; up by 1.50%) The gains were supported by expectations of a good quarter from the NBFC sector, along with improved credit demand and pickup in loans. Institutional buying and stability in the finance sector also helped its stock price. 5. Larsen & Toubro (CMP: Rs 3,601 ; up by 1.15%) The stock benefited from optimism around the company’s capital goods and infrastructure projects, which are expected to see steady execution and revenue inflows in the coming quarters.Top LosersShanthala FMCG Products (CMP: Rs 38.50 ; down by 3.87%)The stock saw a steep decline of 12% at intraday and has been away from its 52-week high for a while now, with promoters recently increasing their holding. The stock came under pressure due to thin liquidity and heightened volatility in smaller counters, with no major company-specific developments to support buying interest. 2. GSS Infotech (CMP: Rs 28.66 ; down by 12.62%) The fall is attributed to weak market sentiment for technology stocks and lack of any positive triggers or news, leading to profit booking after a recent upmove. The company reported a consolidated net loss in its recent earnings, with standalone net sales for June 2025 down 6.97% year-over-year (announced on August 6, 2025). 3. KCK Industries (CMP: Rs 44.20 ; down by 9.15%) KCK Industries is seeing continued low trading volumes and little investor interest, which has caused increased volatility and sharp downward movement. No major fundamental news combined with technical weakness and sector-specific selling activity likely drove the fall, with its intraday lowest being at -9.20%. 4. Adani Enterprises (CMP: 2,244.70 ; down by 1.34%) The decline is linked to broader market weakness and some profit booking following prior gains. The stock fell as low as 1.55% at intraday. The modest drop is part of a continued multi-day decline (six consecutive sessions of losses in late August), amid broader Adani group pressures. 5. Apollo Hospitals (CMP: Rs 7,610 ; down by 1.53%) The fall is related to profit booking after recent gains and uncertain outlook in the healthcare sector. The stock fell as much as 2% during trading today. The drop occurred on the day of the company's AGM (August 29, 2025), where a Rs 10 per share final dividend for FY25 was up for approval amid strong prior Q4 growth.

Click to View More Outlook for September 1 Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets began the new derivatives series on a muted note, extending the prevailing corrective phase. After an initial uptick, the Nifty traded in a narrow range for most of the session; however, selling pressure in select heavyweights during the closing hours dragged the index lower. Consequently, it settled near the day’s low at 24,426.85, down 0.30%. Sector-wise, barring FMCG, all major sectors ended in the red, with realty, IT, and auto leading the decline. The broader indices also mirrored this trend, losing nearly half a percent each. The ongoing decline appears to be more sentiment-driven in the absence of fresh positive triggers. Notably, the Nifty is now approaching a critical support zone at 24,250–24,350. Meanwhile, the banking index has almost tested its major support around the 200 DEMA at 53,600, which could prompt some pause or even a rebound. That said, participants should continue to adopt a cautious approach, with greater emphasis on risk management, until there are clear signs of a consolidation. Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities The downside momentum continued in the market on Friday and Nifty closed the day lower by 74 points amidst choppy movement. After opening on a weak note, the market made an attempt to bounce back in the early to mid-part of the session. The selling pressure has emerged towards the end and the markets closed at the lows. A small negative candle was formed on the daily chart with long upper shadow. Technically, this market action indicates weak bounce and sell on rise in the market. Hence, one may expect some more weakness in the coming week. Nifty is nearing a crucial lower support around 24300-24200 levels (previous swing low and 200day EMA), but a sustainability above the said supports could be doubtful. Hence, a decisive move below 24200, the Nifty could slide down to the next lows of around 24000-23900 levels in the near term. However, a strong upside momentum above the hurdle of 24700 could change the sentiment in favor of bulls.

Is Sebi revisiting F&O suitability? Recent remarks indicate entry criteria discussion is back on table and here's how it could look,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/is-sebi-revisiting-f-o-suitability-recent-remarks-indicate-entry-criteria-discussion-is-back-on-table-and-here-s-how-it-could-look-13500091.html,"Recent speeches by Sebi Chairman Tuhin Kanta Pandey and Whole Time Member Ananth Narayan G suggest that the regulator may reconsider its stand on product suitability and entry barriers for Futures & Options (F&O). The process, if revived, will undergo a thorough consultative exercise with exchanges, brokers, and other market participants. Moneycontrol has learned that last year the idea of product suitability was discussed with expert working group. The proposal was to introduce product suitability framework by evaluating various criteria at the time of account opening. Also, based on combination of various financial and non-financial related checks, an overall profile score was to be generated. What kind of entry checks possible? As per the note circulated by Sebi to the expert working group last year, when the proposal was under active consideration, financial and non-financial parameters were suggested. These parameters then envisaged may give some clue about the regulatory thinking. Financial: For the financial criteria the income and tax paid data was to be picked up based on Income Tax Return (ITR). Minimum amount in the bank account for past few months and minimum net worth for writing options was proposed. Non-Financial: Also, there was a non-financial criterion like a mandatory exam, though kind of exam was not elaborated. Initial cooling off period after account opening before enabling F&O, Mandatory cooling off or closure after losing certain amount in F&O, only permitting Accredited Investors to participate in F&O and a System driven Stop Loss Approach by exchanges or brokers was discussed. But the proposal was abandoned then, as participants wanted to see the regulatory measures initiated especially the steps to curb frenzy on weekly expiry. Regulatory thinking on excessive F&O tradesThe regulatory intent was to ensure that derivatives are accessed only by individuals with the financial capacity to handle leveraged products amid volatility. Sebi has repeatedly stressed that ease of account opening and digitisation should not give unqualified investors exposure to complex products. The aim is to reduce the number of small traders incurring heavy losses by consolidating participation among investors and institutions with stronger financial capacity and market knowledge. Retail traders’ losses in F&O and Sebi's concerns Sebi in the note to expert working group said, “Considering growth of derivatives segment over the years combined with increased participation by individual investors in this segment and the poor profitability outcome for them, there is a need to stipulate certain objective criteria for allowing access to this segment”. Sebi’s recent study on F&O trading suggests that 91 percent of traders incurred losses in FY25 in F&O. The study indicates that the net losses of individual traders widened by 41 percent to Rs 1,05,603 crore in FY25 from Rs 74,812 crore in FY24, after accounting for transaction costs. The existing practice of on-boarding clients As per the existing practice, SEBI Circular Aug 22, 2011 mandates brokers to collect documents (ITR, bank statement, net worth certificate) for clients trading in derivatives, but no minimum threshold is specified. Brokers are asked to share risk disclosure documents also, but hardly its explained to the clients. Can the issue be solved without new barriers?Brokers have resisted client profiling, arguing that verifying ITRs and bank accounts is cumbersome. The regulatory view is that if brokers conduct proper profile checks at the onboarding stage and exchanges enforce compliance, the issue could be addressed without new entry barriers. Currently, clients are provided with risk disclosure documents during account opening, but most rarely read them until faced with heavy losses. Also read: Sebi panel recommends, open offer process may be faster with quicker payout to investors South Korean Model for entry check in derivatives South Korea permits only qualified retail investors in its derivatives market through a two-stage entry system. In the first stage, investors must complete an education programme, undergo mock trading, and deposit a minimum margin before being allowed to trade in simple index or stock futures. In the second stage, those with over a year’s trading experience and a higher margin deposit can access more complex products such as structured futures and options. No regulatory change without consultation Though the same proposal of product suitability was abandoned last year due to concerns in implementation from stakeholders, especially from brokers. Sebi, has again clarified that any regulatory tweak in equity derivatives whether in tenure of contracts or product suitability will not happen without wider consultation. An email seeking comments from Sebi on the issue of product suitability did not elicit any response. Sebi, Chairman, Tuhin Kanta Pandey in his speech at FICCI CAPAM on August 21, said on the issue of equity derivatives, “We will consult with stakeholders on ways to improve, in a calibrated manner, the tenor and maturity profile of derivative products, so that they better serve hedging and long-term investing. Ensuring risk awareness and suitability is equally important and constructive ideas for appropriate stakeholder engagement will be much needed to achieve this goal”. In the same event, Sebi’s Whole Time Member, Ananth Narayan G, also emphasised on the issue of equity derivatives and said, “Equally important is ensuring risk awareness and suitability amongst participants. We are open to objective and simple mechanisms to ensure that derivative participation is informed, suitable, and appropriate. Here again, stakeholder engagement will be key – we are open to all constructive ideas” Sebi had first raised the concern of excessive equity derivative trading, in its July 2017 discussion paper. Even then the issue of product suitability was raised but the proposal could not take off. Also read: Sebi may tweak key norms governing ETF trading to reduce risk, align with real-time conditions"
"FMCG shares rise ahead of next week's GST council meet; Colgate, ITC, HUL gain up to 3%",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/fmcg-shares-rise-ahead-of-next-week-s-gst-council-meet-colgate-itc-hul-rise-up-to-3-13499776.html,"Shares of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies gained in Friday’s trade ahead of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council meeting scheduled for September 3-4. The council, chaired by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, is expected to deliberate on moving to a two-rate structure of 5 percent and 18 percent, with a special levy of 40 per cent on items such as luxury cars and sin goods. At present, GST follows a four-tier structure of 5, 12, 18 and 28 percent. Colgate-Palmolive surged up to 4 percent to an intraday high of Rs 2,357.90 on the NSE after a report said GoM on GST has proposed a GST cut to 5% on toothpaste. Britannia, ITC, Dabur, Patanjali Foods, Emami and Marico advanced between 2 percent and 3 percent. Hindustan Unilever also traded higher. Tracking the movement, the Nifty FMCG index climbed 1.7 percent, with 12 of 15 index constituents trading in the green. GST Council to meet on September 3-4 in New Delhi Items in the 12 percent bracket such as ghee, butter, cheese, paneer, bottled water, juices, instant noodles, pasta, wafers and Chyawanprash could shift to 5 percent if the proposal is cleared. ""Indian FMCG companies are on a structural growth path, with several categories like shampoos and premium detergents still under-penetrated and underserved. Increasing rural penetration further strengthens the sector’s growth potential. Additionally, government tax incentives, potential rate cuts, and the recent GST reduction are expected to further spur consumption,"" said Axis Securities recently. ""FMCG demand remained stable, showing a gradual sequential improvement backed by favorable macros. The rural market continued to perform well, with urban demand also picking up. Our staple companies reported sales growth of 10% (est. 6%), EBITDA was +1% (est. +1%), and APAT was flat YoY (est. +2%). Volume growth for most companies was limited to low- to mid-single digits. The early onset of the monsoon impacted the summer product portfolio of a few consumer companies (Dabur, Emami),"" said Motilal Oswal Financial Services earlier this week. Sanjiv Puri, Chairman, ITC Ltd., said PM's vision to unleash next generation reforms especially in the GST framework is far-sighted and will spur a virtuous cycle of consumption, investment, growth and employment. ""The Government’s resolve to ensure ease of living by enhancing affordability and accessibility of all items meant for daily consumption, including foods, for a large section of society will benefit the sizeable middle-class population, MSME’s and farmers,"" he added. FMCG stocks are seen as key beneficiaries of a rate cut. Food and beverages currently fall under 5, 12 and 18 percent slabs.

"BSE, Angel One, other capital market stocks drop up to 4%, fall for 4th day on weak investor sentiment",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/bse-angel-one-other-capital-market-stocks-fall-for-4th-day-on-weak-investor-sentiment-13499756.html,"The shares of several capital market stocks dropped in trade on August 29, as investor sentiment remained muted in the midst of global uncertainties. The sharp drop in the share prices pushed the capital markets index down into the red for the fourth consecutive session. The Nifty Capital Markets index dropped nearly 2 percent to close at around 4,092. The shares of Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) were the top loser on the index, plunging nearly 4 percent to trade at Rs 2,099 apiece. Motilal Oswal Financial Services shares followed, also dropping nearly 4 percent to close at Rs 857.35 apiece. Nuvama shares fell nearly 3 percent, while Angel One, 360 One WAM and Kfin Technologies shares fell more than 2 percent each. Central Depository Services (CDSL), NAM-India and HDFC AMC shares closed nearly 2 percent lower. UTI AMC, Indian Energy Exchange (IEX), Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC and MCX shares closed in the red with marginal losses. The capital market stocks have remained under pressure recently, as US increased tariffs on Indian imports to a whopping 50 percent. The index has now dropped more than 6 percent in four consecutive sessions so far. The fall in the capital markets stocks comes as benchmark indices closed in the red, erasing all early gains. Sensex fell nearly 271 points (0.34 percent) to 79,809.65, while Nifty 50 fell 74 points (0.30 percent) to 24,426.85. The combined cash market turnover of the BSE and NSE continued to weaken in August, slipping to a six-month low, as volatility in Indian equities kept investor participation subdued. Exchange data analysed by Moneycontrol showed that the average daily turnover in the cash segment has dropped below Rs 1 lakh crore so far in August, marking the lowest level since February. This is also the second consecutive month of decline on a month-on-month basis and down nearly 20 percent from June, underscoring the absence of a strong rally that had previously spurred momentum-driven trading. Instead, benchmark indices have largely moved sideways in recent weeks, leading to muted volumes. Market sentiment has been weighed down by persistent global uncertainty, especially around trade and tariff issues. However, domestic liquidity remains resilient. Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) inflows touched record highs, reflecting continued confidence of retail investors in India’s long-term growth prospects.

The Ahmedabad-based drugmaker plans to file for USFDA approval in the first quarter of 2026, targetting a market projected to reach $10.8 billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 36.3%. The trial met its primary endpoint, with 48.5% of patients on Saroglitazar 1mg achieving a meaningful biochemical response compared with the placebo. The drug also met other key results including complete normalization of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), a critical marker of disease progression. The trial enrolled 149 patients across multiple centers and was designed as a seamless study. Full data will be presented at an upcoming scientific congress, the company said. “Saroglitazar is the first PPAR alpha/gamma agonist to demonstrate positive Phase 3 data in PBC,” said Pankaj Patel, Chairman of Zydus Lifesciences. “It has the potential to bring real value to patients and providers who need more options.” PBC affects thousands globally and is often resistant to first-line of therapy using ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). Saroglitazar, which targets both bile acid toxicity and liver inflammation, has received Orphan Drug and Fast Track designations from the USFDA. “In clinical practice, we often see patients who continue to struggle despite being on standard therapy,” said Dr. Raj Vuppalanchi, Global Principal Investigator for the EPICS-III study. “Expanding our treatment options could significantly change how we personalize care for PBC.” Zydus Therapeutics is focused on rare and serious liver conditions, including PBC and Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH). The company leverages a global R&D network of over 1,300 researchers and 30 manufacturing sites. Shares of Zydus Lifesciences rose 0.88% and were trading at Rs.985.45 on BSE at 12.05 pm on Friday, the benchmark Sensex rose 0.13% to 80,182.51 points."

"Garment, footwear shares rise on hopes that lower GST may spur demand; Trent, Relaxo among key gainers",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/garment-footwear-shares-rise-on-hopes-that-lower-gst-may-spur-demand-trent-relaxo-among-key-gainers-13499019.html,"Shares of textile and footwear companies were sharply higher in early trade on August 29, in anticipation of benefits from the proposed GST rate rationalisation, which will be taken up by the GST Council next week. News reports suggest that the Group of Ministers (GoM) on rate rationalisation may propose to the council to reduce GST on textile products such as glimped yarn, metallised yarn and rubber thread to 5 percent from the current 12 percent. The panel is also expected to recommend raising the price threshold for readymade garments attracting 5 percent GST to Rs 2,500 from Rs 1,000. Garments priced above Rs 2,500 could attract 18 percent GST compared to 12 percent at present, CNBC-TV18 reported citing people familiar with the developments. For footwear, GST on items priced above Rs 2,500 is likely to be increased to 18 percent from 12 percent. Anticipating these changes, shares of Trent were higher by over 3 percent, making it one of the top gainers on the Nifty 50 index. Siyaram Silk Mills gained 3.55 percent to touch an intraday high of Rs 630 on expectations of higher sales following a lower GST slab. Indiamart Intermesh and Avenue Supermarts also saw buying interest, rising up to a percent intraday. Among footwear stocks, Relaxo Footwears surged 9.34 percent while Khadim India advanced more than 10 percent. The buying comes amid recent declines in textile and leather shares following the imposition of a steep 50 percent tariff on Indian goods entering the United States.

"Yes Bank shares jump 4% after report says SMBC set to infuse Rs 16,000 crore",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/yes-bank-shares-jump-4-after-report-says-smbc-set-to-infuse-rs-16-000-crore-13499072.html,"Yes Bank shares jumped nearly 4 percent in the morning trading hours of August 29. This comes after a report by the Economic Times said that SMBC is set to invest Rs 16,000 crore ($1.83 billion) in the Indian private lender through a combination of equity and debt. The proposed infusion by the Japanese financial giant is aimed at strengthening Yes Bank's balance sheet, and is seen to be a precursor to SMBC taking an ownership position, ET reported, citing people familiar with the matter. The reported infusion will comprise Rs 7,500 crore in equity, and Rs 8,500 crore in debt. This will be in addition to the Rs 13,500 crore that SMBC has committed to pay the lender's existing shareholders, including State Bank of India (SBI) and others, for acquiring a 20 percent stake in Yes Bank, the report further said. The Rs 16,000-crore infusion will be reflected in Yes Bank's books, while the Rs 13,500 crore will be paid to the bank's shareholders to facilitate their exit, according to the report. Moneycontrol couldn't independently verify the report. As part of the debt funding, SMBC will opt for yen-dominated bonds equivalent to Rs 8,500 crore, priced below 2 percent, to ensure low-cost, long-term funding, ET cited a source as saying. The equity infusion of Rs 7,500 crore will be done through a foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs), in order to boost its capital, the source added. Last week, Yes Bank said that the RBI has accorded approval to Japan-based Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC) to acquire up to 24.99 percent stake in the lender. This came after Yes Bank in May disclosed that SMBC proposed to acquire 20 percent holding in the lender through a secondary stake purchase of 13.19 percent stake from the State Bank of India (SBI) and 6.81 percent share from seven other shareholders. Other shareholders are Axis Bank, Bandhan Bank, Federal Bank, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, IDFC First Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank. Yes Bank shares were trading at around Rs 19.41 apiece in the morning. The shares have gained nearly 16 percent in the past six months, and have a P/E ratio of over 21. Also read: Our LIVE blog on stock market updates"

"UBS upgrades Kotak Bank to a Buy, says non-lending financials will outpace lending businesses",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/ubs-upgrades-kotak-bank-to-a-buy-says-non-lending-financials-will-outpace-lending-businesses-13499182.html,"Brokerage UBS has come out with a bullish note on financials, where it has projected the profit pool of the sector to nearly double over five years, and has upgraded Kotak Mahindra Bank to a Buy from Neutral, with a target price of Rs 2450 per share. The note said the non-lending businesses within the financial sector such as AMCs and wealth management are expected to grow up to 1.5-1.7 times faster than the lending businesses, showing strong outperformance. Among NBFCs, UBS said it is bullish on Chola Finance and PFC, and prefers SBI Life among its play on insurers. The sector is expected to benefit from a structural shift in household saving and investment pattern. The note added that it sees Paytm's margins improving going forward and raised its target on the stock to s 1250 per share from the previous Rs 1,100 per share. On Kotak Bank, UBS believes the stock is the best way to play the financial services sector, supported by its various subsidiaries, expecting the re-rating in the stock to continue. Kotak's key subsidiaries include Kotak Securities, Kotak AMC, Kotak Life, Kotak Alternate Assets and Kotak Prime. Shares of Kotak Mahindra Bank are higher by over 1.3 percent in early trade on August 29, while the Nifty 50 is marginally in the green and the Bank Nifty is higher by 0.4 percent. During its June quarter earnings call, Kotak Bank had told analysts that it expects the bank's Net Interest Margin (NIM) to stabilize over FY26, and the full benefit of RBI's repo rate cuts would accrue to borrowers in Q2FY26. The lender said it has reduced its unsecured advances from 11.6% to 9.7% by tightening underwriting norms, especially for unsecured business. The bank added that it saw a sequential increase in slippages and credit cost due to its microfinance business and stress in retail commercial vehicle loans, along with a seasonal impact on the rural segment.

"Ola Electric Mobility shares surge 20% this week on PLI boost, GST buzz",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/ola-electric-mobility-shares-surge-20-this-week-on-pli-boost-gst-buzz-13499011.html,"Shares of Ola Electric Mobility rallied as much as 5 percent on Friday to Rs 57.50, taking weekly gains to nearly 20 percent. A mix of policy triggers and company-specific developments fuelled the rally, with the highlight being the company’s Production Linked Incentive (PLI) certification for its Gen 3 scooter portfolio. In an exchange filing on August 26, the EV maker said it had received certification of compliance under the PLI scheme for automobiles and auto components, granted by the Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) under the Ministry of Heavy Industries. The approval covers all seven scooters in Ola’s S1 Gen 3 line-up — including the S1 Pro 3 kWh, S1 Pro 4 kWh, S1 Pro+ 4 kWh, S1 X 2 kWh, S1 X 3 kWh, S1 X 4 kWh and S1 X+ 4 kWh. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates The company noted that both its Gen 2 and Gen 3 scooters are now PLI-certified. With the Gen 3 range accounting for the bulk of Ola’s current sales, management expects the certification to significantly enhance profitability beginning Q2FY26. Another sentiment booster has been the buzz around a possible GST cut on entry-level two-wheelers and EVs. Additionally, reports that Niti Aayog has convened a meeting with leading two-wheeler manufacturers to accelerate the electrification of motorcycle sector lifted optimism this week. Government estimates indicate electric scooters could make up as much as 80 percent of sales by 2030. However, penetration in motorcycles may reach only about 10 percent, keeping the overall two-wheeler electrification rate at roughly 36 percent — well short of policymakers’ ambitions. To bridge this gap, discussions are likely to focus on scaling up production, reducing upfront costs, exploring battery-swapping solutions and offering innovative financing models to make EV motorcycles more competitive. Also read: Govt to begin work on smartphone PLI 2.0 to boost exports, competitiveness with China, Vietnam Also, Ola founder Bhavish Aggarwal has reiterated the company’s ambition to capture 25–30 percent of India’s electric two-wheeler market. He said the company’s strategy of vertical integration, coupled with new product launches, will ensure long-term profitability as volumes scale. “Our mojo is still there,” Aggarwal remarked last week, expressing confidence in Ola’s ability to hold margins while chasing growth. At about 10:20 am, shares of the company were trading at Rs 56.1, higher by 2.3 percent from the last close on the NSE.

The other potential beneficiary, DOMS Industries, saw selling pressure and traded almost a percent lower in the morning. A panel of ministers on rate rationalisation is expected to present proposals that could see taxes on several items either scrapped or sharply reduced, CNBC TV-18 reported, citing sources. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates According to the proposals, GST on erasers and exercise books may be cut to zero. At the same time, rates on pencils, crayons, sharpeners, maps, atlases and related items could also drop to nil from the current 12 percent. Taxes on products such as mathematical and geometry boxes, as well as colour boxes, may be lowered to 5 percent. It is essential to note that these are preliminary suggestions, and the final decision will be made by the GST Council when it convenes in New Delhi on September 3–4.

"Sensex, Nifty open flat amid weakness in auto, IT, metal stocks",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sensex-nifty-open-flat-amid-weakness-in-auto-it-metal-stocks-13498586.html,"Benchmark indices Nifty and Sensex opened subdued on Friday, August 29, slipping into a third straight day of losses and setting up a weak close for the week. Decline in IT, auto and metal stocks dragged the markets lower, while broader markets bore the brunt as mid and smallcap indices saw sharper declines. At about 9:30 am, the Sensex was down 7.67 points or 0.01 percent at 80,072.90, and the Nifty was down 1.90 points or 0.01 percent at 24,499.00. About 1517 shares advanced, 1373 shares declined, and 132 shares were unchanged. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates One striking aspect of yesterday’s trade was that despite heavy domestic buying of Rs 6,920 crore, which far outpaced FII selling of Rs 3,856 crore, the Nifty still fell 211 points. The drag came from a build-up of short positions by FIIs, driven by concerns over the 50 percent Trump tariff and stretched valuations in India, V K Vijayakumar of Geojit Investments said. Back home, policy measures like fiscal support through the Budget, monetary easing via rate cuts, and the expected GST rationalisation are likely to bolster growth and corporate earnings in the coming quarters. A sustainable rally will then have stronger fundamentals behind it. In the meantime, investors may look to accumulate fairly valued stocks on market declines and stay patient for the upturn, experts say. Among movers, Navneet Education gaiend up to 2 percent after CNBC TV-18 reported that the Group of Ministers on rate rationalisation may table proposals for a major GST revamp. According to sources, the GST Council could consider revising rates on items such as erasers, maps, atlases, sharpeners, pencils, crayons, exercise books, mathematical sets, geometry boxes and colour boxes. The report added that the proposals include cutting GST on erasers and exercise books to nil, and reducing rates on items like pencils, crayons, sharpeners, maps and geometry boxes from 12 percent to either nil or 5 percent. Bharat Forge shares were down over a percent after Morgan Stanley said that exports to the US made up 38 percent of its standalone revenue in FY25, with about 30 percent of the topline exposed to the recent hike in tariffs from 10 percent to 50 percent. While the company managed to pass on part of the impact in the June quarter when the lower tariffs were in place, the sharper levy could now dent its EBITDA by nearly 30 percent. Technical View ""Technically, this market action indicates a down trend continuation pattern. The crucial support of the previous opening upside gap of 18th Aug has been broken decisively on the downside at 24670, and Nifty closed below it. Another support of the ascending trend line connecting April to Aug 25's bottom has also been broken on the downside. This is not a good sign,"" says Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities. ""The underlying trend of Nifty continues to be negative, and more weakness could be in store for the short term. The next lower supports to be watched are around 24,300-24,250 (previous swing lows and 200-day EMA). Any pullback could find strong resistance around 24,700 levels,"" he added. HUL, Asian Paints, Trent, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Tata Consumer Products, and Shriram Finance were the top gainers on the Nifty. Laggards on the index included Tata Motors, NTPC, ONGC, Hero MotoCorp, and Titan Company.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Caplin Point, Jindal Stainless, Engineers India, Advanced Enzyme, Nykaa, Endurance Tech, and others on August 29?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-caplin-point-jindal-stainless-engineers-india-advanced-enzyme-nykaa-endurance-tech-and-others-on-august-29-13497964.html,"The benchmark indices remained under pressure for the second consecutive session, falling nearly 1 percent on August 28, the F&O expiry day. Bears dominated market breadth with about 1,901 shares declining compared to 835 advancing shares on the NSE. A rebound may be possible after the severe sell-off, but sustainability is the level to watch given the bearish sentiment. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Jay Mehta, Technical Research at JM Financial Services Avenue Supermarts | CMP: Rs 4,700 Avenue Supermarts (DMart) has been consolidating within a triangular pattern since April 2025, characterized by below-average trading volume, suggesting an accumulation phase. On August 18, the stock broke out above this pattern with a breakaway gap, indicating a surge in buying interest. The price is currently trading above all major Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs), supported by a notable increase in volume, which validates the breakout. Momentum indicators display a bullish outlook, reinforcing an upward trajectory toward Rs 4,900 and Rs 5,166. A potential pullback to the Rs 4,440–4,550 support range could present a favourable entry point for buyers. The Average Directional Index (ADX) indicates sustained bullish momentum, with the DMI+ line positioned above the DMI- line. Strategy: Buy Targets: Rs 4,900, Rs 5,166 Stop-Loss: Rs 4,126 Kirloskar Brothers | CMP: Rs 1,985.8 Kirloskar Brothers delivered a significant breakout above a complex bullish head-and-shoulders pattern (not a classical one) on June 23 from the Rs 1,910 level, rallying to Rs 2,475 within just five trading sessions. Since then, the price has trended downward, approaching a retest of the prior breakout zone. Recently, it has established a short-term base near the 200-day EMA, which coincides with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the upward move. Additionally, the stock has broken out above a short-term triangular consolidation pattern. A robust support base is forming around the Rs 1,930–1,960 range, where the 20-day, 50-day, and 100-day EMAs converge. Momentum and trend indicators suggest a continuation of the recent upward momentum. Strategy: Buy Targets: Rs 2,150, Rs 2,280 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,840 Hardik Matalia, Derivative Analyst at Choice Broking Caplin Point Laboratories | CMP: Rs 2,156.2 Caplin Point Laboratories, on the daily chart, had been moving within a parallel channel formation. Recently, it witnessed a breakout from this channel, followed by a retest, and is now showing early signs of reversal, suggesting renewed buying interest at current levels. If the stock sustains a move above the Rs 2,200 mark, it would confirm the breakout and reversal, opening the door for further upside towards the Rs 2,400 level in the near term. Such a move would also validate the completion of the consolidation phase and signal a continuation of the broader positive trend. Momentum indicators also support this view. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 54.76, reflecting a reversal with early signs of a positive crossover, highlighting improving momentum. Additionally, the stock has taken consistent support at its 20-day, 50-day, and 100-day EMAs and is now trading comfortably above all key moving averages, underlining strength in its overall structure. From a price action perspective, the breakout and successful retest provide confidence that bulls are gradually regaining control. This setup offers a favourable risk-reward scenario for traders. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,400 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,040 Engineers India | CMP: Rs 200.3 Engineers India, on the daily chart, has been trending within a falling parallel channel, reflecting a corrective phase. At present, it is on the verge of breaking out of this channel, signaling the possibility of a trend reversal. A sustained move above the Rs 205 mark would confirm the breakout and could trigger further upside momentum. Such a move would indicate the end of the corrective phase and set the stage for a potential rally towards higher levels. Momentum indicators also support this developing setup. The RSI stands at 42.92, showing a strong reversal from lower levels and trending upwards, which highlights improving momentum and buying interest. Furthermore, the stock has reversed from its recent swing lows and is now approaching its key moving averages. A decisive move above these moving averages would further strengthen the bullish outlook. From a technical standpoint, the breakout from the falling channel coupled with supportive momentum suggests that bulls are gradually regaining control. This provides a favourable risk-reward opportunity for traders. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 221 Stop-Loss: Rs 190 Jindal Stainless | CMP: Rs 806.5 Jindal Stainless continues to remain in a strong overall uptrend. Over the past few months, the stock underwent a wide-range consolidation phase, which helped in building a solid base. On the daily chart, this consolidation has taken the shape of a Rounding Bottom formation, a bullish continuation pattern that often precedes further upward movement. Recently, JSL has given a strong breakout from this formation, highlighting the resumption of its bullish momentum. If the stock manages to surpass and sustain above the Rs 820 level, it would confirm the breakout strength and could open the way for a move towards the Rs 895 mark in the near term. Such price action would reaffirm the continuation of its prevailing uptrend. Momentum indicators also support this bullish outlook. The RSI is at 74.69 and continues to trend upwards, reflecting strong buying interest and robust momentum. Furthermore, JSL is comfortably trading above all its key moving averages — short-term, medium-term, and long-term EMAs — underlining the strength of its underlying trend. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 895 Stop-Loss: Rs 765 Om Mehra, Technical Research Analyst at Samco Securities Advanced Enzyme Technologies | CMP: Rs 324.15 Advanced Enzyme Technologies, in the latest session, posted a strong bullish candle backed by a sharp rise in volumes, indicating renewed momentum. After a period of sideways consolidation near the Rs 300 zone, the stock has staged a breakout from its recent base, reaffirming strength in the short term. The price has moved above both the 20-SMA and 50-SMA, signalling an improving outlook and positioning itself for further gains. Momentum indicators support the bullish view. The RSI has rebounded to 54, climbing above the neutral zone and reflecting rising strength. The MACD has turned positive with a fresh crossover, confirming the shift in momentum toward the upside. The breakout zone near Rs 315–320 now acts as a strong support base. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 352 Stop-Loss: Rs 308 FSN E-Commerce Ventures Nykaa | CMP: Rs 233.84 Nykaa continued its upward momentum, advancing and registering its third consecutive positive close. The stock has broken past the consolidation band around Rs 220, confirming a clean breakout that now turns this zone into a strong support base. Sustained trading above the 20-SMA (Rs 216) and Supertrend support adds strength to the prevailing uptrend. The RSI has climbed to 70, showing positive momentum without divergence. The MACD is in a positive crossover, with the histogram expanding steadily, further validating the breakout strength. The higher-high formation and steady volume alongside the rise in price indicate a strengthening trend. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 248 Stop-Loss: Rs 223 Endurance Technologies | CMP: Rs 2,859.70 Endurance Technologies is forming a strong bullish candle that adds weight to its emerging cup and handle pattern on the daily chart. The stock has been consolidating above the 20-SMA and 50-SMA while also maintaining a firm hold above the Supertrend support, indicating strength in the medium-term uptrend. The RSI has climbed to 64, and the MACD is skewed to the higher side. Volume remains steady alongside the price increase. A breakout above the Rs 2,900–2,930 neckline would confirm the pattern, potentially unlocking further upside.

"360 One Private Equity Fund, Manager and KMP settle case with Sebi for Rs 14.62 lakh",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/360-one-private-equity-fund-manager-and-kmp-settle-case-with-sebi-for-rs-14-62-lakh-13497291.html,"The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has settled enforcement proceedings against 360 One Private Equity Fund, its manager 360 One Alternates Asset Management Limited, and key managerial personnel (KMP) Saksham Kohli after they jointly paid a settlement amount of Rs 14.62 lakh. The case pertained to violations of the Alternative Investment Funds (AIF) Regulations, 2012. Sebi observed that 360 One Private Equity Fund, through its scheme 360 One Seed Ventures Fund 1, had simultaneously accepted investments from other AIFs while also investing in units of AIFs. This breached Regulation 15(1)(da) of the AIF Regulations. The fund manager and Kohli were also held liable for additional violations under Regulations 20(1), 20(5) and clauses of the code of conduct. The matter came to light in June 2023 when the scheme’s filings disclosed investments of Rs 54.19 crore in AIFs, despite having an AIF investor within the scheme. The non-compliance was later corrected on October 30, 2024, but Sebi initiated an examination and found grounds for enforcement action. On December 23, 2024, Sebi issued a Notice of Summary Settlement to the Fund, its manager, and Kohli, followed by a Supplementary Notice on March 20, 2025. The regulator offered settlement upon payment of Rs 14.62 lakh jointly and severally, in line with the Sebi (Settlement Proceedings) Regulations, 2018. The three applicants opted for the summary settlement route and remitted the prescribed amount within the stipulated 30-day period. Sebi confirmed receipt and, on August 28, 2025, passed a formal order. The case highlights Sebi’s increasing scrutiny of AIFs, which have grown rapidly in recent years. With rising concerns over inter-fund investments and structural complexities, Sebi has been tightening compliance and disclosure norms to enhance transparency."
"Sensex falls 1,500 points in two days, Nifty at 24,500 amid additional US tariffs; experts suggest these strategies for index traders",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sensex-falls-1-500-points-in-two-days-nifty-at-24-500-amid-additional-us-tariffs-experts-suggest-these-strategies-for-index-traders-13496872.html,"Indian stocks recorded strong losses on August 28, closing in the deep red for the second consecutive session after US increased tariffs on Indian imports to a whopping 50 percent. Analysts expect the downturn to continue, although some say that chances for a sharp rally cannot be ruled out. Sensex dropped nearly 706 points (nearly 0.9 percent) to close at 80,080.57. Sensex has now fallen more than 1,500 points over the past two sessions on tariff jitters. Nifty 50 meanwhile fell more than 211 points (0.85 percent) to end today's session at 24,500.90. All sectoral indices closed in the red, except consumer durables. Nifty Bank plunged more than 1 percent (over 630 points) to close at 53,820.35, with private lenders leading losses. What lies ahead? Today's dip in the equity markets was indeed larger that what was expected, said Osho Krishan, Senior Analyst of Technical & Derivatives at Angel One. ""Although initial lows were quickly recouped, the rebound proved to be short-lived, as bearish sentiment prevailed, resulting in the Nifty index falling below the 100-day EMA,"" the analyst explained. According to Krishnan, 24,350 is expected to function as a critical support level for Nifty tomorrow. If Nifty falls below this level, it can then fall to as low at 24,100. If the index shows any rebound, investors must analyse that thoroughly due to the lack of favorable macroeconomic developments, he added while painting a bleak technical outlook for the benchmark index. ""In terms of levels, 24,700-24,800 appears to be an intermediate obstacle, and it is advisable to consider reducing long positions on any bounce for the time being,"" he further said. For Bank Nifty, Krishnan suggested resistance at 54,250 – 54,500, and support at 53,600 – 53,400. 'Quick pullback rally cannot be ruled out' Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research at Kotak Securities, however said that a quick pullback rally from the current levels cannot be ruled out as market is currently oversold, although the short-term market outlook is weak. The weak market sentiment will likely continue as long as Nifty remains below 24,600 and Sensex below 80,600, he said, while adding that the benchmark indices can slip to as low as 24,300 and 79,700 respectively. ""On the flip side, if the market moves above 24,600/80600, the pullback could extend up to the 20-day SMA (Simple Moving Average) or 24,725/81000. Further upside may also continue, potentially lifting the market up to 24,800/81300,"" he added. 'Nifty must begin forming higher high and higher low to pause the current drop' Bajaj Broking noted that the technical charts for Nifty 50 signal continuation of the corrective decline. It said that it has formed a ""second consecutive sizable bear candle with a lower high and lower low"". In order to pause the current drop, Nifty needs to start forming higher high and higher low in the daily chart, Bajaj Broking said. ""Nifty has immediate support base placed at 24,400-24,350 levels being the confluence of the recent lows and the key retracement area. Index holding above the same will lead to a consolidation in the range of 24,400-24,900. While failure to do so will signal acceleration of decline towards 24,000-23,800 levels being the confluence of the 52 weeks EMA and the previous major lows and the previous major breakout area,"" it noted. In its technical analysis for Bank Nifty, the domestic brokerage said that the bank index also has formed a lower high and lower low, signaling continuation of the corrective decline. ""Going ahead, failure to move above 55,000 will keep the bias down and will open downside towards 53,500-53,000 levels in the coming sessions. Key support is placed at 53,500-53000 levels being the confluence of the 200 days EMA and the low of May 2025,"" it added. Despite the downturn, market experts believe that an India-US trade deal may soon be reached and Indian economy remains support, which will soon lead to recovery in the market after the current dip. Market expert Madhusudan Kela said the current downturn in the stock markets is only temporary, and investors should use this dip to buy stocks, which have undergone strong price correction. Speaking to CNBC Awaaz, he added, ""Prime Minister Narendra Modi has handled several such crises in the past in a very decisive way. I don't think there is anything to worry that much about.""

Oncology emerges as top revenue and profitability driver for India’s leading hospital chains,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/oncology-emerges-as-top-revenue-and-profitability-driver-for-india-s-leading-hospital-chains-13497072.html,"India’s top hospital chains are witnessing a structural shift in their revenue mix, with oncology emerging as the fastest-growing and most profitable specialty. Once a niche segment, cancer care is now central to the strategic plans of Max Healthcare, Apollo Hospitals, and Fortis Healthcare, among others, driven by rising incidence, improved diagnostics, and high-complexity treatments that command premium pricing. “Oncology clearly is growing faster for us,” said Abhay Soi, Chairman and MD of Max Healthcare. “We are making significant investments in radiation oncology infrastructure, especially in Lucknow and Dwarka, where new bunkers are being commissioned,” he said in a recent interview to Moneycontrol. At Max, oncology now contributes nearly 25 percent of inpatient revenue, making it the largest therapeutic segment. Fortis Healthcare reported 28 percent year-on-year growth in oncology revenue in Q1 FY26, with the segment accounting for 16.4 percent of total hospital income. CEO Dr. Ashutosh Raghuvanshi of Fortis in recent earnings call said that when accounting for oncology-related treatments classified under other specialties, the total revenue contribution is estimated to be around 19 percent to 20 percent, even surpassing cardiology — its largest therapeutic segment — by revenue. Raghuvanshi expects the momentum to continue as Fortis expands oncology setups across its network. “We expect that kind of growth will continue for another few years,” Raghuvanshi said. “We are adding oncology setups to hospitals where it is not there at the moment,” he added. Apollo Hospitals, which pioneered proton therapy in India, sees oncology as both a clinical and commercial imperative. Apollo operates 13 Comprehensive Cancer Centres (CCCs) across 12 cities, equipped with 23–25 LINACs for advanced radiation therapy. “In terms of why is every hospital chasing it (oncology) ..because the volumes are truly large. It's growing at 15 to 18 percent. Environmental stresses are adding to this. And the whole thing about the morbidity can be prevented,” told Suneeta Reddy, Managing Director of Apollo Hospitals to Moneycontrol recently. Oncology is the second largest revenue contributor for Apollo with 17 percent share to its healthcare services business in Q1FY26. “We are helping save lives. We invest in high-end technology. We were able to get the best doctors, able to publish clinical research in the Oncology space and really improve survivorship for patients,” she said. “It fits in very well with Apollo’s ethos of having some purpose before we make investments and grow certain segments,” she added. Hospitals are also investing heavily in infrastructure. Cancer care is more capital intensive than other segments, as it requires expensive radiation therapy, robotic surgery machines, and advanced diagnostics. HCG reported a 17 percent YoY growth in oncology revenue in Q1 FY26, with LINAC (radiation therapy) utilization rising to 69 percent, reflecting strong demand. Why is oncology surging? The growth in oncology is underpinned by factors such as rising cancer incidence, improved screening, insurance penetration, and the inherently high revenue per patient. Cancer care typically involves multidisciplinary teams, advanced diagnostics, and long treatment cycles—making it a high-margin specialty. Treatments such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and robotic surgeries are highly specialized and technology-intensive, which translates into significantly higher revenue per patient or Average Revenue Per Occupied Bed (ARPOB). According to the National Cancer Registry Programme (NCRP) Report 2020, published by the ICMR and the National Centre for Disease Informatics and Research in Bengaluru, the number of cancer cases in 2020 was estimated to be 13.9 lakhs and it is projected to increase to 15.7 lakhs by 2025. The country’s cancer burden is growing at a compound annual rate of 6.8 percent, and experts estimate that actual incidence may be 1.5 to 3 times higher than reported figures due to underdiagnosis and limited registry coverage. Head and neck, gastrointestinal and lung contributes to 50 percent incidences in males and breast, cervix uteri and gastrointestinal organs in case of females. Head and neck, prostate and ovarian cancer are growing at a faster pace than other cancers. As insurance penetration improves through both private and government schemes, more patients can afford advanced oncology procedures, further fueling demand. Moreover, hospitals with strong oncology programs enjoy a reputation premium, allowing them to command better pricing and attract patients seeking high-quality, specialized care. This convergence of clinical need and commercial opportunity is making oncology the centerpiece of growth strategies for India’s leading hospital chains."

"Taking Stock: US tariff shock drags Nifty below 24,500 on monthly expiry day; Sensex slips 706 pts",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/taking-stock-us-tariff-shock-drags-nifty-below-24-500-on-monthly-expiry-day-sensex-slips-706-pts-13495912.html,"The profit booking continued on second consecutive session on August 28 as the benchmark indices fell nearly 1% after 50% US tariffs on India came into effect. The market opened lower, continuing Tuesday's fall, with Nifty falling below 24,500, intraday, amid selling across the sectors. However, buying at lower levels, especially in consumer durables names, capped the losses. At close, the Sensex was down 705.97 points or 0.87% at 80,080.57, and the Nifty was down 211.15 points or 0.85% at 24,500.90. The BSE midcap index shed 1 percent and smallcap index declined 0.9%.

Click to View More Outlook for August 29 Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets extended their decline on monthly expiry day, losing nearly a percent and continuing the corrective trend. After a weak opening, the Nifty staged a swift rebound in the initial hours, but sustained pressure from heavyweight stocks across key sectors dragged the index to fresh lows as the session progressed. It eventually settled near the day’s low at 24,500.9. Sectoral performance was broadly weak, with IT, realty, and banking stocks leading the decline. The broader indices also mirrored this trend, with mid- and small-cap segments slipping close to a percent each. Sentiment remained under strain from the implementation of additional 25% U.S. tariff, which, combined with weakness in heavyweights such as banks, is exerting steady pressure on the markets. In the absence of major domestic triggers, global developments continue to drive near-term direction. On the technical front, the Nifty has breached its medium-term support at the 100-day EMA around 24,600. The next support is seen in the 24,250–24,350 zone, which aligns with the previous swing low and the long-term 200-day EMA. On the upside, the 24,650–24,800 region, earlier a support zone, is now likely to act as resistance. Traders are advised to align positions with the prevailing trend and exercise heightened caution in stock selection. Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical Research and Derivatives at SBI Securities Technically, the Nifty is showing strong signs of weakness. The index is now trading below its 20-day, 50-day and 100-day EMAs, all of which have started to edge lower, reflecting a build-up of downward momentum. This alignment of key averages turning south indicates that short-term as well as medium-term trends are under pressure. Adding to the concern, the daily RSI is on the verge of slipping below the crucial 40 mark and continues to remain in a declining trajectory. A breach of this level would further strengthen the bearish undertone, suggesting that momentum is favouring sellers over buyers. From a technical perspective, unless the Nifty reclaims its short-term moving averages with strong volume support, the bias is likely to remain negative in the near term. Going ahead, the 100-day EMA zone of 24630–24650 is expected to act as a crucial hurdle for the Nifty. As long as the index remains below this zone, the overall sentiment is likely to stay weak. On the downside, the index may first drift towards 24350, and a sustained breach of that support could open the gates for a further slide towards the 24200 level. A decisive move above 24650 would be needed to negate the bearish momentum and signal the possibility of a short-term recovery. Until then, the market trend remains tilted in favour of the bears.

The Nifty PSU Bank index was down nearly 0.7 percent to hover around 6,803 in the afternoon. The index has now dropped nearly 5 percent in six consecutive sessions of recording losses. Punjab & Sind Bank (PSB) was the top loser on the index, dropping nearly 2 percent to trade at around Rs 28 apiece.

Bank Nifty, with a bearish candle formation, has broken below the important and crucial support zone at the 55,000 level to weaken the bias and sentiment, expecting a further slide with the next major support visible near the 53500 zone. For the bias to improve, the index needs to witness a revival and move past the significant 50EMA level at the 55700 zone to establish some conviction and thereafter expect a further rise in the coming days. Bankex with profit booking witnessed a slip down below the 61000 zone to weaken the bias, and further ahead, a decisive breach below the important support of the 200 DMA level of 59900 shall trigger fresh selling pressure with the next major and crucial support positioned near the 58300 zone. For the bias to improve, the index needs to move past the resistance hurdle of the 50EMA level of 62300 to anticipate further rise in the coming days. BankNifty would have the daily range of 53800-55000 levels,"" said Vaishali Parekh, Vice President - Technical Research at PL Capital, while explaining the technical side of the index. Notably, the Indian government has appointed global investment banking firm Goldman Sachs as the transaction advisor for the stake sale in four public sector banks - UCO Bank, Central Bank of India, Punjab & Sind Bank, and Indian Overseas Bank (IOB). The government will likely dilute its equity stake in each of the four banks by up to 5% over the next two to three years, CNBC-TV18 reported.

State-run BEML has plans to make Tunnel Boring Machines to cut dependence on China,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/state-run-beml-has-plans-to-make-tunnel-boring-machines-to-cut-dependence-on-china-13495488.html,"In a move to reduce India’s dependence on China for Tunnel Boring Machines (TBMs) and to cater to the growing demand from infrastructure projects, state-run BEML is preparing to manufacture TBMs domestically and has invited bids for design consultancy. Sources familiar with the developments have told Moneycontrol that BEML has already initiated discussions with firms from countries like Austria and Japan. “This tender is for design consultancy, and we will have to wait and see the kind of response we receive from global firms. Manufacturing will take some more time,” one source said. BEML, which comes under the Ministry of Defence, recently floated an Expression of Interest (EoI) seeking partnerships with globally reputed design consultancy firms for the indigenous design and development of TBMs. The company is seeking interested parties with a proven track record in designing TBMs ranging from 6 metres to 16.5 metres in diameter. Also Read: MC Explains: Overcrowded Bengaluru Metro coaches: Fallout of Indo-China conflict India has witnessed a growing demand for TBMs for Metro rail, tunnel roads, hydroelectric, irrigation, mining, and other infrastructure projects. Government’s Backing The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) too is playing a major role in encouraging indigenous TBM production, given the surge in metro rail projects across the country. MoHUA sources said a meeting with senior officials of BEML was held in June 2025 in New Delhi where the PSU presented its proposal to manufacture TBMs ranging from 6m to 15m in diameter. ""BEML is likely to begin with a 6.5-metre diameter TBM project in the first phase, possibly in collaboration with Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC)"" one MoHUA source told Moneycontrol.

The Centre’s budget for Metro projects in 2025-26 has jumped to Rs 34,807 crore, a more than six-fold rise compared to 2013-14. Focus on Customised Design and Urban Needs The shortlisted design consultancy will be responsible for analysing project-specific factors, including geological and geotechnical conditions, tunnel geometry, production targets, risks and regulatory requirements. “Based on this analysis, the appropriate TBM type- such as Earth Pressure Balance (EPB), Slurry, Hard Rock, or Dual Mode - will be selected for different Indian conditions, especially in urban areas with mixed-face geology and high groundwater pressure”, the tender document said. BEML said that the TBMs will be designed to minimise settlement impact, reduce noise and vibration, and offer tight turning radius capability for use in densely built environments. “The after-sales service will be rendered by our nationwide service network with the support of the design consultancy firm,” the PSU said in its EoI document. Also Read: Bengaluru's infra body invites global bids for Rs 17,700 crore tunnel road project This is not BEML’s first venture into the TBM segment. In 2009, BEML signed a Memorandum of Agreement with France-based NFM Technologies to manufacture TBMs for India and Southeast Asia. However, the partnership stalled in 2018 after NFM was acquired by German firm Mühlhäuser, which shifted focus to the European market. Currently, India relies heavily on imported TBMs, mainly from Herrenknecht (Germany), Terratec (Australia), CRCHI and STEC (China), and Komatsu (Japan), with many of these assembled in China. The recent Indo-China border standoff had disrupted TBM imports, affecting major infrastructure projects such as Mumbai’s underground Metro project.

"JTEKT India, steering supplier to Maruti, abuzz as investor assess e-Vitara order ruboff",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/jtekt-india-steering-supplier-to-maruti-abuzz-as-investor-assess-e-vitara-order-ruboff-13495677.html,"Shares of JTEKT India, a manufacturer of steering systems, are higher by as much as 10 percent in trade on August 28 after investors placed bets on increased orders from Maruti Suzuki for its export-focused SUV, the e-Vitara, for which the ancillary player is a complete supplier. Shares of JTEKT India clocked their best day since May 2023 on very high volumes that have taken the stocks above its 100 and 200-Day Moving Averages. On August 26, Maruti Suzuki inaugurated its electric vehicle (EV) and battery plant in Hansalpur, Gujarat, as well as launched Maruti Suzuki’s first electric vehicle, the e-Vitara, which will be exported to over a hundred countries. Maruti Suzuki has invested about Rs 21,000 crore in the Gujarat facility and plans to invest additional Rs 3,100 crore to add a fourth production line. The company is largely into the manufacturing of high-performance manual steering gear, hydraulic and electric power steering, and other allied components, with leading car companies as clients, including Maruti Suzuki, Toyota, Tata Motors, Mahindra, Honda, Renault, Nissan and others. JTEKT India is a 100% supplier for this new SUV model, e-Vitara, that has been unveiled for exports. ""...whatever exports and domestic production will happen, we will be supplying for that. And the good news is that we are a complete system supplier for this particular product. We will be supplying manual gear. We will be supplying Chemical Process System (CPS), and we will be supplying Constant Velocity Joints (CVJ) also. And we are very hopeful for that. Our lines are ready. We are ready with our production facilities,"" Rajiv Chanana, CFO, JTEKT India said during the March quarter earnings call. In anticipation of an increased order flow from Maruti, JTEKT India has already started work on expanding capacity. Maruti Suzuki contributes 56 percent to JTEKT India's annual revenue. As a component supplier, JTEKT India will be heavily dependent on its OEM's performance and the overall demand outlook. The auto parts maker is looking to ramp up its Constant Velocity Joints (CVJ) business, for which the company has set up a new line at a capex of Rs 100 crore. Assuming a capex of Rs 300 crore for FY26, JTEKT India said it will end up with about Rs 760 crore of capex over a three-year period. ""...currently we are at around 5% market share (in CVJ). I think we should be expanding to within a year or so. We expect that we may touch 7.5%, 10% kind of a number,"" CFO Chanana said in June. So far, the company has been talking only to Maruti and Toyota, but the management is confident of attracting other customers too. ""...we want to expand that to not only to Maruti and Toyota, we need to expand to other customers also. So, this is where we are struggling, and we are working, and we want this to be a big success story for India. And this is a possibility, and we are very, very hopeful about expanding CVJ."" Japan's JTEKT Corporation is a majority shareholder in the company with which it has a technical collaboration."
"Concerns of retail response in mega IPOs? Here are 10 IPOs that saw retail put in bids worth more than Rs 10,000 cr each",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/concerns-of-retail-response-in-mega-ipos-here-are-10-ipos-that-saw-retail-put-in-bids-worth-more-than-rs-10-000-cr-each-13495571.html,"There have been at least 10 initial public offers (IPOs) till date – with the most recent one witnessed just last month – wherein retail investors participated in huge numbers with the cumulative size of the retail applications exceeding Rs 10,000 crore. This assumes significance as a recent consultation paper by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) highlighted industry concerns related to retail response in mega-sized IPOs while proposing to reduce the retail quota in public issues. Though the proposal was rolled back – while allowing companies to list with a small quantum of dilution – data clearly shows that retail response is not always a concern even in instances when the IPO size runs into thousands of crores. Data from PRIME Database shows that the highest-ever quantum of retail bids was seen in 2008 when Reliance Power launched its IPO to raise Rs 10,123 crore. The retail portion was subscribed 13.57 times with 46.23 lakh applications with the cumulative bid amount pegged at nearly Rs 40,000 crore. While no other IPO has come close to touching that retail number again, there have been quite a few that saw the retail response in the range of Rs 10,000 crore and Rs 17,000 crore each. For instance, last year saw the IPO of Waaree Energies hitting the market to raise Rs 4,321 crore. More than 70 lakh retail applications were received with the total size of bids pegged at Rs 16,470 crore. The year 2024 was witness to three other IPOs – Bajaj Housing Finance, KRN Heat Exchanger & Refrigeration and Unimech Aerospace & Manufacturing – wherein the cumulative worth of retail bids was in excess of Rs 10,000 crore each. Interestingly, the IPO size of KRN Heat Exchanger & Refrigeration and Unimech Aerospace & Manufacturing was Rs 342 crore and Rs 500 crore, respectively. Industry experts say that retail response is not a concern if the issue is reasonably priced and the outlook for the company and the sector is robust. “We have to acknowledge that retail investors do like to invest in IPOs and the data shows that even large issues, if attractively priced, have generated tremendous response from retail,” says Pranav Haldea, Managing Director, PRIME Database. “With SEBI allowing companies to come to the market with a smaller float, I think the concerns of the industry around the retail demand have been largely put to rest,” he adds. Most recently, NSDL saw nearly 46 lakh retail applications pour in with the total bid size pegged at nearly Rs 10,500 crore even as the overall IPO size was only Rs 4,011 crore. In the past, Tata Technologies, MOIL, Reliance Petroleum, and Coal India also saw huge response from retail investors.

Within this, the super-premium & luxury segment (12 mn cases) contributes just 3% of overall industry volume but delivers 21% of profits. Realisations in premium and super-premium to luxury are 3x and 7x higher, respectively, than those in the prestige and semi-prestige segments. Outlook We model revenue/ EBITDA/ PAT CAGRs of 12%/18%/28%, over FY25-27E. Maintain BUY with a DCF-based revised target price of INR 600 (prior: INR 580).

The team highlighted that while industry-wide demand remains mixed, budgets are opening up for vendors that can deliver outcome-driven solutions. Clients are fatigued by plain-vanilla RFPbased procurement, though they are willing to fund transformation initiatives by vendors that bring true solutioning capabilities. The healthy momentum in large deals continues, with Coforge aiming to sign at least 20 deals above USD20m in FY26 (five done so far). Outlook We believe Coforge’s strong executable order book and resilient client spending across verticals bode well for its organic business. Cross-selling opportunities in Cigniti remain highly synergistic for the company. We value Coforge at 38x FY27E EPS with a TP of INR2,240, implying a 29% potential upside.

Ola Electric shares jump 15% in two sessions on PLI certification for its Gen 3 scooters,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/ola-electric-shares-jump-15-in-two-sessions-on-pli-certification-for-its-gen-3-scooters-13495442.html,"The shares of Ola Electric Mobility jumped nearly 10 percent to hit a five-month high of Rs 55.75 on August 28. The stock has now gained nearly 15 percent in two consecutive sessions after the firm said it has secured PLI certification for its Gen 3 scooter portfolio. The shares of the Bhavish Aggarwal-led company have now recovered nearly 41 percent from its 52-week low of Rs 39.6 per share in just over a month. In an exchange filing released on August 26, Ola Electric said, ""Ola Electric, India’s largest pure-play EV company, today announced that it has received Certification for Compliance with the eligibility assessment requirements under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for automobile and auto components sector, for its Gen 3 scooter portfolio. This certification was granted by the Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) under the aegis of the Ministry of Heavy Industries, Government of India to all of the seven Ola S1 Gen 3 scooters."" The EV-bike maker said its Gen 2 and Gen 3 scooter portfolio are now PLI-certified. Its Gen 3 portfolio, which comprises S1 Pro 3 kWh, S1 Pro 4 kWh, S1 Pro+ 4 kWh, S1 X 2 kWh, S1 X 3 kWh, S1 X 4 kWh and S1 X+ 4 kWh, comprises majority of its current sales. As a result, this certification is set to significantly enhance its profitability from Q2FY26 onwards, the company said. The PLI certification makes Ola Electric eligible for incentives ranging from 13% to 18% of the determined sales value (DSV) until 2028, it added. The shares of the company had surged nearly 5 percent on August 26 after the announcement. The stock has now extended massive gains. It is currently the top gainer on the Nifty Midcap 100 index. The stock is however down around 58 percent from its 52-week high of Rs 132.70 apiece, which it had hit in August last year. Is Ola Electric the next Zomato? Helios Mutual Fund recently added Ola Electric to its portfolio due to its potential in the EV two-wheeler space, the fund house's CEO Dinshaw Irani told The Economic Times. Speaking to the newspaper, Irani compared Ola to Eternal (Zomato), and how Helios' early bet in the food delivery giant played out. Helios had bought Zomato shares for around Rs 40 apiece. The stock is currently trading at around Rs 320 apiece. Speaking about the PLI certification, Ola Electric's spokesperson said, ""Securing PLI certification for our Gen 3 scooters, which form the bulk of our sales, is a critical step towards profitability. This will directly strengthen our cost structure and margins, enabling us to deliver sustainable growth. With our auto business targeted to turn EBITDA positive, the certification acts as a strong catalyst to achieve that goal while ensuring our customers continue to get the best-in-class EVs at highly competitive prices.""

"Auto parts maker Suprajit Engineering sees 'minimal impact' of 25 percent Trump tariffs, exploring 'full relief' from buyers",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/auto-parts-maker-suprajit-engineering-sees-minimal-impact-of-25-percent-trump-tariffs-exploring-full-relief-from-buyers-13494879.html,"Auto ancillary player Suprajit Engineering, which derives over half of its revenue from exports, sees 'minimal impact' of the additional 25 percent US tariffs, an exchange filing said on August 28, and the company will be exploring a 'full relief' from its customers. ""Most parts are not affected at all, but a small portion of exports with a possible tariff impact of about $0.5 million is estimated. This will be discussed with respective customers for full relief,"" the statement said. Suprajit Engineering said it has carried out customs consultants in US to arrive at this assessment. Shares of the company have reversed early losses, and is trading higher by over 0.5 percent, in-line with broad gains in the automotive space. Over the last one month, the shares are down 3.5 percent, and are lower by 5.6 percent on a YTD basis. The company has a market capitalisation of over Rs 6,200 crore. The company counts on leading automotive players as clients, including Bajaj Auto, TVS Motors, Hero Motocorp, Piaggio Vehicles, BMW, Volkswagen and M&M, among others.

So, we are seeking support from the customers. Now we will need to see how this and where this tariff lands and our biggest concern here is the effect on OEM and end customers, particularly how it will affect the US economy and the global economy,"" MD and Group CEO NS Mohan said during the June quarter earnings call. ""I believe that the tariff actually offers a good opportunity for us in the medium to long term than many of our competitors have."" Suprajit said the company's exposure to the US market stands at around $100-110 million, of which 70 percent is compliant with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, implying the products meet the rules of origin outlined in the agreement, to ensure it originates from North America. As of Q1FY26, there has not been any impact related to tariffs on the company, Suprajit said. ""...our conversation so far with the customer is that about 30 plus percent have agreed to accept the increased tariffs,"" founder and chairman Ajith Kumar Rai said."
