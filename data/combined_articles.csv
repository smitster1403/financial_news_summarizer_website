Defence stocks jump up to 10% after Russia's fresh attacks on Ukraine amid ceasefire talks,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/defence-stocks-jump-up-to-10-after-russia-s-fresh-attacks-on-ukraine-amid-ceasefire-talks-13479388.html,"The shares of defence companies recorded notable rise on August 22 after Russia increased its attacks on Ukraine, despite US President Donald Trump advocating for a ceasefire between the two countries. The sharp fall in the share prices pushed the Nifty India Defence index up nearly 1 percent to hover around 7,760.25. Russia launched one of its largest attacks on Ukraine, sending 574 drones and 40 missiles to the neighboring country, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. One person was killed and 22 were wounded in the overnight strikes, authorities said. According to Zelenskyy, a missile strike on a US-owned electronics firm was a ""telling"" indicator of Russian intentions in U.S.-led peace initiatives. ""Now the signals from Russia are simply, to be honest, indecent. They are trying to back away from the need to hold meetings. They don't want to end the war. They carry on with massive strikes,"" he said in a video address. This comes after US President Donald Trump said earlier this week that there was an agreement for a bilateral meeting between Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Vladimir Putin now demands that Ukraine gives up all of the eastern Donbas region, renounce ambitions to join NATO, remain neutral and keep Western troops out of the country, Reuters reported citing sources. The Russian president met Donald Trump in Alaska last week for the first Russia-US summit in more than four years and spent almost all of their three-hour closed meeting discussing what a compromise on Ukraine might look like, the report further said. The defence stocks had earlier tumbled amid rising ceasefire talks and lack of fresh triggers. The fresh escalations in the Russia-Ukraine war may have re-boosted the stocks. DCX Systems shares rallied around 10.5 percent to trade at Rs 275.50 apiece. Solar Industries and Zen Technologies shares gained around 2 percent each. Astra Microwave Products, Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL), Bharat Electronics (BEL) and Paras Defence shares gained around 1 percent each, while Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers (GRSE), BEML and Bharat Dynamics (BDL) shares were trading in the green with marginal gains.

Urban infra lender Hudco likely to cross annual loan book guidance of Rs 1.5 lakh crore during Q3FY25,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/urban-infra-lender-hudco-likely-to-cross-annual-loan-book-guidance-of-rs-1-5-lakh-crore-during-q3fy25-13479184.html,"Hudco, a lender for government-backed housing and urban development projects, said the company is likely to cross its annual loan book guidance of Rs 1.5 lakh crore during Q3FY25, and could end up lending around Rs 1.55-1.60 lakh crore this fiscal, though the lender will review the guidance after the second quarter for any changes. ""...after Q2, we will be revisiting and we'll see that if the guidance needs to be changed. ...we will be crossing Rs 1.50 lakh crore may be in Q3 or sometime before that,"" said Hudco's CMD Sanjay Kulshrestha during the June quarter earnings call earlier this month. The lender has sanctioned over Rs 32,000 crore during the first quarter, with disbursement of around Rs 12,800 crore, which makes the sanction to disbursement ratio at around 35 percent. This disbursement amount is all-time high for the company, and Hudco said it is now targetting around 30 percent growth on full-year disbursement for FY25, which was Rs 40,000 crore. Hudco said for the past 10 quarters, the lender has not recorded new NPAs and is moving towards being a 'zero NPA company', with net NPA down to slightly less than 0.1 percent. As of now, around one-third of Hudco's borrowing is based on floating rate and rest is fixed rate borrowing. ""Hudco is a company which is not agnostic to any sector, and we are funding to each and every sector. We are serving the requirement of state government. In some states, the roads may be the priority, but in other states, the river linking is a priority,"" chairman Sanjay Kulshrestha said. ""...we have started exploring new areas, new segments, new infrastructure segment. We had also explored new states and other entities...,"" the chairman added."

Its ability to leverage group cargo while steadily growing third-party volumes (52% in 1Q FY26) underlines its position in India’s port and logistics ecosystem. The company has reiterated that expanding port capacity remains a core priority, with plans to scale from 177MTPA today to 400MTPA by FY30. Alongside ports, JSWINFRA is pursuing an aggressive logistics infrastructure build-out under JSW Ports Logistics, supported by an investment plan of INR90b through FY30. This expansion is expected to deliver revenue of INR80b and EBITDA of INR20b at scale. Outlook We expect JSWINFRA to strengthen its market dominance, leading to a 13% volume CAGR over FY25-27E. This should drive a 22% CAGR in revenue and a 23% CAGR in EBITDA over the same period. We reiterate our BUY rating with a TP of INR380 (premised on 23x FY27 EV/EBITDA).

This comes ahead of US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's speech at the annual Jackson Hole symposium. The Nifty Metal index declined over 0.7 percent to stand at 9,424, while the Nifty Realty index fell more than 0.5 percent to hover around 912, as seen at 10.20 am. The American central bank is holding its annual symposium from August 21 to August 23 in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak on the economic outlook and central bank's policy framework on Friday. US President Donald Trump has criticised Powell multiple times for not cutting rates. In a Truth Social post, Trump referred to Powell as ""Jerome ‘Too Late’ Powell"" and accused him of not acting promptly to reduce interest rates. He also stated that Powell is ""hurting"" the housing industry ""very badly"" and reiterated his call for a cut in key interest rates. Most investors now expect a 25-basis-point Fed rate cut next month. A rate cut in the US could reduce borrowing costs for foreign investors, encouraging them to invest in higher growth markets in India. This boosts real estate and metal stocks. Additionally, investors expect the RBI to follow Fed in the pursuit of a rate cut, if any. This too can further impact the stocks. JSW Steel and Jindal Steel & Power shares dropped over 1.3 percent each, while Steel Authority of India (SAIL) and Hindustan Zinc shares fell more than 1 percent each. Adani Enterprises, Hindustan Copper, Tata Steel and National Aluminium Company (NALCO) shares fell nearly 1 percent each, while Hindalco, Vedanta and Welspun Corp shares were down with marginal losses. Raymond shares were the top loser on the realty index, dropping nearly 2 percent to trade at Rs 622 apiece. Oberoi Realty, Macrotech Developers (Lodha), DLF and Anant Raj shares fell nearly 1 percent each, while Phoenix Mills, Brigade Enterprises and Godrej Properties shares were down marginally in the red."

"Vodafone Idea shares jump 4% after report says PMO to take a call on relief measures; should you buy, sell or hold?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/vodafone-idea-shares-jump-4-after-report-says-pmo-to-take-a-call-on-relief-measures-should-you-buy-sell-or-hold-13478975.html,"The shares of Vodafone Idea (Vi) jumped over 4 percent on August 22 after a report said that the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) is set to take a call on a relief proposal for the telecom major. The shares of the company were trading at Rs 6.85 apiece in the early trading hours. PMO had received an informal note from the Department of Telecommunication (DoT), proposing multiple relief options for the debt-ridden telecom company, Mint reported citing people familiar with the matter. These options include another two-year pause on paying the statutory dues under moratorium currently. The PMO will take the decision on whether these relief measures are to be extended, the report cited a source as saying. DoT has also proposed to give Vodafone Idea more time to repay dues, smaller annual payouts, and a waiver on penalties and interest penalties on AGR payment, the report added. Moneycontrol couldn't independently verify the report. Vodafone Idea has been struggling with dues, owing about Rs 83,400 crore in adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues, with annual payments of nearly Rs 18,000 crore scheduled from March 2025. Its overall dues to the government stand at around Rs 2 trillion including penalty and interest, Mint said. The debt-laden operator has repeatedly warned it cannot survive without funding support, as banks remain wary of lending given its financial stress. Vi employs over 18,000 people and has nearly 198 million subscribers. A collapse, analysts note, could reduce India’s telecom sector to a two-player market dominated by Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel. Telecom service provider Vodafone Idea (Vi) is exploring non-bank avenues to fund its capital expenditure plans, as negotiations with lenders remain stalled due to uncertainty over adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues, outgoing CEO Akshaya Moondra said on August 18 during the June quarter earnings call. Vi has also formally urged the government to settle the AGR matter ahead of the March 2026 deadline, which Moondra said would help reassure banks and unlock financing support. ""Given the fact that we are keen on maintaining a continuity of our capex, which has been going on since last year, we are looking at non-banking sources of funding, also not the full amount of Rs 25,000 crore that we have talked about, but a lesser amount so that we can continue with the capex cycle,"" Moondra said. Should you buy, sell or hold? Motilal Oswal recommended a 'Sell' rating for the stock, with a target price of Rs 6 per share. This implies a downside potential of more than 8 percent from the previous closing price of Rs 6.55 per share. “We cut our FY27-28E revenue and EBITDA estimates by ~4-5% each, driven by higher subscriber declines. We reiterate our SELL rating on Vi with a revised TP of INR6, based on DCF implied ~12.5x Sep’27E EV/EBITDA,” the domestic brokerage said. ICICI Securities kept a 'Hold' rating for the stock, with a target price of Rs 7 per share. This implies an upside potential of nearly 7 percent from the previous closing price. “VIL has funding to incur elevated capex only till Q2FY26; its future capex is dependent on closing the funding arrangement which has been in the process for a while. VIL is also hopeful of a resolution on AGR matter before its first EMI due in Mar’26, remains critical for establishing its going concern status,” the brokerage noted.

"Markets snap 6-day rally: Sensex down 400 pts, Nifty below 25,000 as bank, metal, IT stocks drag",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/markets-snap-6-day-rally-sensex-down-400-pts-nifty-below-25-000-as-bank-metal-it-stocks-drag-13478724.html,"Benchmark indices Nifty and Sensex were off to a weak start, snapping their 6-day gaining streak on Friday, August 22, as investors booked profit at elevated levels. Auto, bank, metal and IT stocks were the big drags while the broader market mirrored weak trends to edge lower. At about 9:40 am, the Sensex was down 396.99 points or 0.48 percent at 81,603.72, and the Nifty was down 127.65 points or 0.51 percent at 24,956.10. About 1246 shares advanced, 1661 shares declined, and 135 shares were unchanged. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates ""The six-day rally in equities could run into resistance as Trump’s proposed tariffs loom large. If the 25 percent levy takes effect in August—as now seems likely—the drag on India’s growth could exceed the earlier 20–30 basis point estimates based on reciprocal tariffs. Markets will have to price in that risk,"" V K Vijayakumar of Geojit Investments Ltd said. ""However, a key development has been the relative strength of largecaps, a trend that appears both justified and sustainable, he added. At the open, sectoral trends were mixed. Pharma, media, energy and consumer durables posted modest gains, while FMCG and realty were flat. On the other hand, metals, banks, IT, oil & gas and autos were under pressure, dragging broader indices lower. The India VIX inched up 2.1 percent, signalling some uptick in market volatility. Midcap and smallcap indices also opened in the red. Among individual stocks, Apollo Hospitals Enterprises fell 1 percent to Rs 7,852 in morning deals on August 22 after Suneeta Reddy, promoter and managing director of the company, offloaded 1.32 percent of her holding in the healthcare major through a block transaction, Bloomberg data showed. The deal, involving approximately 18.97 lakh shares, is valued at Rs 1,489 crore and has a floor price of Rs 7,850 per share. FMCG bellwether, Hindustan Unilever, traded in the red after it announced a leadership transition, appointing Niranjan Gupta as its next Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and member of the Management Committee. Gupta will take charge as CFO and Executive Director, Finance from November 1, 2025, succeeding Ritesh Tiwari, who has been elevated as Global Head of M&A and Treasury at Unilever Plc. Technical View Nifty’s broader structure remains constructive, with higher lows indicating persistent buying interest. The near-equal positioning of both call and put writers highlights the possibility of a consolidation phase, but a sustained move above 25,150 could unlock the next leg higher towards 25,250, likely forcing call writers into short covering. Support zones have shifted higher, with 24,850–25,000 now emerging as the key demand area. Firm positioning by put writers at lower strikes further strengthens the positive outlook. Unless the index decisively breaches 24,850, bulls are expected to hold the upper hand. For now, a “buy-on-dips” strategy remains the most prudent approach, with traders watching closely for a breakout above 25,150 to confirm the next leg of upside momentum. L&T, Bajaj Finance, M&M, Jio Financial Services, and Cipla were the top gainers on the Nifty. SBI Life Insurance, Grasim, Hero MotoCorp, Asian Paints, and HCL Tech were the major laggards.

Q1FY26 operating revenue surged 55% YoY to ₹3,131.7 cr, driven by strong performance in the Wind Turbine Generator (WTG) segment, which delivered 444 MW, marking a 62% YoY increase. OMS division posted a modest 10% YoY revenue growth for the quarter, while the Forging division surged 60% YoY to ₹146.49 cr. Suzlon’s share in Forging rose from 40% to 62%, driven by strong order execution. Gross profit rose 58% YoY, even as raw material costs jumped 85%, driven by effective price pass-through strategies that helped maintain profitability. Higher capacity utilization in the WTG and forging business, led to stronger operating leverage. As a result, EBITDA reached ₹599.07 cr, with a margin expansion of 82.3 bps. Profit before tax (PBT) grew 52% YoY to ₹459.23 cr. However, a ₹134 cr deferred tax charge led to higher tax expenses, moderating the growth in profit after tax (PAT), which stood at ₹324.32 cr, up 7% YoY over a high base. Outlook Suzlon’s ALMM compliance and backward integration offer a strong competitive moat, but sustaining margin discipline remains key to preserving pricing power. Factoring in execution risks, we revise our valuation multiple to 35x (from 38x earlier) FY27E EPS of ₹2.2 to arrive at a target price of ₹75, upgrading our rating to a BUY recommendation.

At 8:10 am, the Gift Nifty slipped 80 points, or 0.32 percent, to 25,041, hinting at a softer start for Dalal Street on Friday, August 22. Indices gained on Thursday, lifted by pharma, oil & gas and banking stocks. The midcap and smallcap index, however, broke their three-day rally to end lower, while weakness in autos, FMCG and PSU banks also capped the upside. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Foreign investors (FIIs/FPIs) pumped Rs 1,247 crore into Indian equities on Thursday, August 21. At the same time, domestic institutional investors (DIIs) sustained their support with net purchases of Rs 2,546 crore, according to provisional exchange data. Here are the important levels to watch out for in today’s session. Nifty’s broader structure remains constructive, with higher lows indicating persistent buying interest. The near-equal positioning of both call and put writers highlights the possibility of a consolidation phase, but a sustained move above 25,150 could unlock the next leg higher towards 25,250, likely forcing call writers into short covering. Support zones have shifted higher, with 24,850–25,000 now emerging as the key demand area. Firm positioning by put writers at lower strikes further strengthens the positive outlook.

For now, a “buy-on-dips” strategy remains the most prudent approach, with traders watching closely for a breakout above 25,150 to confirm the next leg of upside momentum. “Nifty Bank index continues to struggle for strong directional momentum, with leading banking heavyweights yet to exhibit sustained strength. The immediate hurdle lies in the 55,800–56,000 zone, and only a decisive breakout above this band could unleash bullish momentum, powered by short covering. On the downside, dips toward 55,500 remain attractive accumulation opportunities, supported by firm put writing at lower strikes” Dhupesh Dhameja of SAMCO Securities said. “However, a breach below 55,450 would be an early sign of weakness, opening the doors for a slide toward the 55,000 mark. Until then, sideways movement is expected to dominate”, he added. India VIX slipped 3.50 percent to settle at 11.37. Despite lingering global uncertainties, volatility remains subdued, hinting at a consolidation phase rather than sharp corrections. The muted VIX reading underscores cautious optimism among market participants, with no signs of heightened fear. The Put-Call Ratio (PCR) has eased slightly from 1.34 to 1.01, yet continues to reflect the dominance of put writers and a bullish-to-sideways sentiment in the market.

Around 1,381 shares declined compared to 1,350 advancing shares on the NSE. Overall, the trend remains favourable for bulls, despite the likelihood of intermittent consolidation. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Jay Mehta, Technical Research at JM Financial Services Afcons Infrastructure | CMP: Rs 427.8 Afcons Infrastructure had been trading in a descending triangle pattern since March 2025, hitting a low of around Rs 398 post-listing. It retested this level on April 7 and recently experienced a false breakdown below it on July 29, forming a hammer candlestick. The stock has now broken out above the triangle pattern, with an upside Tasuki candlestick pattern observed recently. Volume has increased positively in the past few sessions, with over 60% average delivery volume. The price is trading above its 20- and 50-day EMAs, and the price action aligns with RSI, showing a higher high and higher low structure in the short-to-medium term. Momentum indicators support a bullish outlook. The ADX trend indicator indicates fading bearish momentum, with bullish strength increasing as DMI+ trades above DMI- and ADX trends upward. A break above Rs 447 could accelerate the rally. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 465, Rs 484 Stop-Loss: Rs 405 Avenue Supermarts | CMP: Rs 4,691.9 DMart had been in a triangular consolidation pattern since April 2025, with below-average volume indicating an accumulation phase. On August 18, it broke out above the pattern with a breakaway gap, signaling renewed buying interest. The price is trading above all key EMAs, and the breakout is backed by positive volume buildup. Momentum indicators reflect a bullish bias, supporting an upward trend toward Rs 4,900 and Rs 5,166. A minor correction to the Rs 4,440–4,550 support zone could offer a buying opportunity. The ADX trend indicator suggests continued bullish momentum, with DMI+ trading above DMI-. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 4,900, Rs 5,166 Stop-Loss: Rs 4,126 Can Fin Homes | CMP: Rs 782.1 After correcting from a swing high of Rs 826, Can Fin Homes formed a base near its 200EMA, consolidating in a tight range for about 14 days. It recently broke out above this range with a surge in positive volume and strong delivery volume in recent sessions. The price is now trading above all key EMAs, which should act as support during minor dips. Momentum indicators support a bullish bias, with RSI trading above 50 and the MACD histogram rising. The ADX trend indicator shows fading prior bearish momentum, with bullish strength increasing as DMI+ trades above DMI-. Also, when comparing the relative move of peers in the housing finance space, Can Fin Homes is showing good relative strength. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 820, Rs 850 Stop-Loss: Rs 750 Mandar Bhojane, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst at Choice Broking Radico Khaitan | CMP: Rs 2,894.8 Radico Khaitan is consolidating just above its breakout level, indicating strength and the potential for a fresh breakout. The move is supported by strong volume participation, reflecting rising bullish interest. A decisive close above Rs 2,900 would confirm the breakout and could pave the way for a fresh upside rally. On the downside, immediate support is placed at Rs 2,850, which also acts as a strong accumulation zone for traders looking to enter on dips. The RSI stands at 62.34 and is trending upward, signaling improving momentum and increasing buying pressure. From a risk–reward perspective, traders may consider keeping a stop-loss at Rs 2,785 to manage downside risk. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,100, Rs 3,200 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,785 Swiggy | CMP: Rs 435.7 Swiggy has given a decisive breakout from a Cup and Handle formation on the daily chart, supported by strong volumes. This indicates that bulls are regaining control and a trend shift is already underway. The momentum outlook remains positive, with the RSI at 67.62 and trending upward, signaling growing strength while still staying below the overbought zone. The Rs 425 level is acting as a strong base and offers a buy-on-dips opportunity for traders. With price action holding above the breakout zone, the stock looks poised for further upside. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 505, Rs 540 Stop-Loss: Rs 407.5 Cipla | CMP: Rs 1,592.8 Cipla has recently broken out of a Symmetrical Triangle pattern on the daily chart. The breakout was backed by a strong bullish candle along with rising volumes, indicating renewed buying interest and a potential shift in trend in favour of the bulls. This price action highlights strength and the possibility of further upside in the stock. On the momentum front, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is placed at 65.9 and trending upward, suggesting growing bullish momentum. The Rs 1,570 level now serves as a strong support zone and could act as a buy-on-dips opportunity for positional traders. Sustaining above the breakout level with continued volume participation would likely open the door for higher levels in the coming sessions. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,700, Rs 1,790 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,525 Om Mehra, Technical Research Analyst at Samco Securities Dr Reddy's Laboratories | CMP: Rs 1,276.6 Dr Reddy’s Laboratories advanced in the latest session, breaking past the falling trendline resistance and closing above both the 20-SMA (Rs 1,245) and 50-SMA (Rs 1,270). This breakout from the recent consolidation phase suggests the stock is attempting to reverse its corrective trend. The daily RSI has improved to 58, indicating strengthening momentum with further scope before entering overbought territory. The MACD has turned positive, supported by a rising histogram, confirming that the short-term bias has tilted in favour of the bulls. The stock has formed a strong bullish candle on the daily chart backed by decent volumes, and is comfortably holding above the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement. On the downside, support is well-defined at Rs 1,255, aligned with the 50-SMA. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,345 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,245 Caplin Point Laboratories | CMP: Rs 2,211.10 Caplin Point Labs advanced 4.25% in the latest session, forming a strong bullish engulfing candle on the daily chart and decisively breaking out from a prolonged consolidation phase. The breakout was supported by a notable rise in volumes and followed weeks of sideways price action, where the stock had been coiling within a broad range. This move now signals a shift in momentum toward sustained upside. The daily RSI has improved to 62, confirming strengthening momentum while still leaving room before entering overbought territory. The MACD remains positive, while the hourly chart displays a higher high formation. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,320 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,140 Cummins India | CMP: Rs 3,886.30 Cummins India has staged a breakout from a well-defined saucer pattern, overcoming the prolonged resistance zone that had repeatedly capped the stock’s up move in recent months. This breakout is supported by a sequence of higher highs and higher lows, underscoring the strength of the ongoing uptrend. The stock continues to trade comfortably above its key moving averages, which are firmly sloping upward, providing a solid base for continuation. The RSI has climbed to 74, reflecting robust bullish momentum, though it is approaching overbought territory, which may invite brief consolidation phases. The MACD remains in positive territory with a widening histogram, confirming trend acceleration.

Click to View More Outlook for August 22 Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The Nifty traded in a narrow range of 25,050–25,150 throughout the day, reflecting limited volatility. Sentiment remains positive, with the index comfortably holding above the short-term moving average. The daily RSI is in a bullish crossover and trending higher. On the downside, support is placed at 24,800; as long as this level holds, a buy-on-dips strategy is likely to prevail. On the upside, resistance is seen at 25,250 and 25,500. Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities Today, the benchmark indices witnessed narrow-range activity. The Nifty ends 33 points higher, while the Sensex was up by 143 points. Among sectors, Pharma and Healthcare indices gained nearly 1 percent, whereas the Capital Market index lost the most, shed over 2 percent. Technically, after a gap-up open, the market experienced range-bound activity throughout the day. On daily charts, it has formed a small candle, indicating indecisiveness between the bulls and the bears. We are of the view that, the larger market trend is upward, but for day traders, buying on intraday corrections and selling on rallies would be the ideal strategy. On the downside, 25,000/81700 and 24,950/81500 would act as key support zones, while 25,150/82300 and 25,250/82500 could be crucial resistance levels for the bulls. However, below 24,950/81500, the sentiment could change. If the index falls below this level, traders may prefer to exit long positions. Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets traded lackluster on the weekly expiry day and ended largely unchanged amid mixed cues. After a flat start, the Nifty moved in a narrow range throughout the session before settling at 25,080. Sectoral performance was mixed, with gains in pharma, realty, and financials, while FMCG, energy, and auto witnessed profit-taking. The broader indices also remained subdued, closing flat to marginally lower. Overall sentiment, however, stayed constructive, with stock-specific moves driving the market. Investors are closely tracking developments around recent discussions and approvals on GST reforms, which are prompting sector-specific reactions. In addition, global cues remain in focus, particularly the Jackson Hole symposium, where commentary from central bankers could influence sentiment. The IT space, in particular, may witness further rebound once clarity emerges on the global policy outlook. Amid this backdrop, we maintain a positive view on the market but advise traders to focus on selective opportunities arising from rotational buying across sectors. At the same time, it is prudent to avoid aggressive positioning in the broader indices and adopt a stock-specific approach in the near term. Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities Nifty continued to move higher on Thursday amidst choppy movement and closed the day with gains of 33 points. After opening on a positive note, the market moved up further in the early part of the session. Nifty failed to breach above 25150 levels and later shifted into a narrow range movement till the end. A small red candle was formed on the daily chart after surpassing the hurdle of down sloping trend line at 25050 levels. Technically this market action indicates lack of strength to witness decisive upside breakout. This could be considered as a short term breather in the market amidst uptrend. The overall uptrend of Nifty remains intact, but short term consolidation or minor weakness can't be ruled out in the next 1-2 sessions before surging higher towards next hurdle of 25300. Immediate support is placed at 25000 levels. Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

The midcap and smallcap index, however, broke their three-day rally to end lower, while weakness in autos, FMCG and PSU banks also capped the upside. At close, the Sensex was up 142.87 points or 0.17 percent at 82,000.71, and the Nifty was up 33.20 points or 0.13 percent at 25,083.75. About 2025 shares advanced, 1886 shares declined, and 145 shares remained unchanged. Also read: GoM approves Centre's GST rate rationalisation proposal, backing the proposed two-slab structure Sectoral indices traded mixed. Pharma was the top gainer, up nearly 1 percent, followed by oil & gas, realty, private banks, infra and IT, all posting modest gains. Metals and media were also marginally higher. On the flip side, FMCG, energy, auto, consumer durables, PSU banks and midcaps were in the red. The India VIX slipped over 3 percent to 11.37, reflecting subdued volatility. Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and Angel One fell as much as 5 percent on Thursday, August 21, after Tuhin Kanta Pandey, Chairman of market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) made new statements with regards to the tenure of equity derivatives. Speaking at the FICCI Annual Capital Market Conference, Pandey said that there is a need to increase the tenure of equity derivatives. Trouble continued for Nazara Technologies' stock, which tumbled another 8 percent, after the Lok Sabha passed the Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Bill, 2025. The bill aims to prohibit all pay-to-play online games, including both games of skill and chance. If passed, the bill would pause the total operations of regulated real-money gaming (RMG) platforms across India. Shares of Ola Electric Mobility tumbled more than 8 percent on August 21 following a massive 30 percent rise over two sessions, after the latest data from VAHAN portal showed rival electric two-wheeler maker Ather Energy nudging ahead on total monthly registrations so far in August, likely prompting some investors to book profits. According to the VAHAN portal, Ola Electric recorded 9,681 registrations in August so far, lower than the 10,283 registrations recorded by rival EV player Ather Energy. Read more: Need to increase tenure of equity derivatives in consultation with stakeholders: Sebi's Tuhin Kanta Pandey Technical View Yesterday’s rally lost steam as the Nifty stalled near 25,096, the initial upside target set for the session. The index is now hovering close to the upper Bollinger Band, a technical signal that suggests consolidation could be on the cards. This makes the path toward the higher objectives of 25,156–25,200 less certain in the near term. While a sharp collapse looks unlikely, traders may need to brace for dips toward 25,000–24,977 or even lower before the market attempts another leg higher. Such pullbacks, if they occur, could offer a healthier base for the next upswing. Cipla, Dr Reddy's, ICICI Bank, Bajaj Finserv, and SBI Life Insurance were the top gainers on the Nifty. Laggards on the index were Bajaj Auto, Coal India, Tata Consumer Products, Power Grid Corp, Eternal, and IndusInd Bank.

Buy Spandana Sphoorty; target of Rs 280: Motilal Oswal,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-spandana-sphoorty-target-of-rs-280-motilal-oswal-13472557.html,"Motilal Oswal's research report on Spandana Sphoorty Spandana Sphoorty’s (SPANDANA) 1QFY26 loss stood at ~INR3.6b (vs. a loss of INR4.3b in 4QFY25). 1Q NII declined ~70% YoY to ~INR1.3b (~8% miss). Operating loss stood at INR587m (PQ: operating profit of INR251m). Total borrower count declined ~18% QoQ to 2m. Opex rose ~10% YoY to ~INR2.1b (inline), resulting in a cost-income ratio of ~140% (PY: ~40% and PQ: ~90%). Credit costs stood at ~INR4.2b, resulting in annualized credit costs (as a % of average loans) of ~34% (PQ: ~36% and PY: ~8%). Technical write-offs stood at INR5.8b (vs. INR6.5b in 4QFY25). As a prudent measure, the company recognized additional credit costs of INR1.3b for the quarter due to technical write-off. Excluding this, impairment costs would have been INR2.9b. Recovery from the 90dpd account was INR410m in 1QFY26 (vs. INR520m in 4QFY25). Spandana indicated that disbursements in Jul’25 were nearly equivalent to the total disbursements in 1QFY26, with momentum strengthening further in Aug’25 as MTD-Aug’25 was tracking better than the corresponding period run-rate in July. Management anticipates a significant acceleration in both AUM and disbursement growth from 2HFY26, even as 2Q is still expected to remain challenging.

TCIEXP IN reported weak set of results as revenues declined 2.1% YoY to Rs2,868mn (PLe Rs2,950mn) with an EBITDA margin of 9.8% (PLe 11.4%) as volumes declined for 7th quarter in a row to 233,000 MT (auto was the key segment facing challenges this time). Pricing pressure was also evident as realization was down 1.3% YoY to Rs12.3 per KG. Given stiff competition, we expect volume and realization CAGR of 4%/1% over FY25-FY27E. However, EBITDA margin is expected to improve 290 bps over the next 2 years amid improvement in utilization levels to 84% by FY27E.

DN’s Q1FY26 adjusted revenue stood at Rs18.7bn, declining to 13.6% YoY and 7% QoQ. Operating performance was impacted by ongoing pricing pressure, oversupply from China, and a decline in spreads. The Advanced Intermediates segment witnessed stable volumes across most products, except agrochemical intermediates, which were affected. The Phenols segment reported steady volumes, but profitability remained subdued due to an influx of cheap imports. Going forward, spreads in the phenolics segment are expected to see some uptick. Projects such as CNA and Hydrogenation were commercialized during the quarter. WNA and the R&D centre are expected to be commissioned in Q2FY26, while Nitration, MIKB, and MIBC projects are likely to come online in H2FY26. The total planned capex for the polycarbonate value chain stands at Rs85bn; however, the management’s guidance of only Rs8bn-10bn capex for FY26 suggests the polycarbonate resin project is unlikely to be commissioned by Dec’27 as previously guided. Outlook DN has been undertaking numerous growth initiatives, primarily in the Phenolics segment. While domestic demand for all products is expected to remain robust, the threat of cheap imports will likely keep margins under pressure. The agrochemicals business is expected to continue facing headwinds in the near term. The stock is currently trading at ~31x FY27 EPS. We upgrade to ‘HOLD’ rating.

Accumulate Indian Oil Corporation; target of Rs 152: Prabhudas Lilladher,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/accumulate-indian-oil-corporation-target-of-rs-152-prabhudas-lilladher-13472650.html,"Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Indian Oil Corporation Indian Oil Corporation (IOCL) reported refining throughput of 18.7mmt with reported GRM of USD2.15/bbl, led primarily by inventory losses. Domestic marketing sales volume stood at 22.4mmt with implied gross marketing margin (GMM) of Rs8.3/lit. Reported standalone EBITDA came in at Rs126.1bn (Ple Rs172bn, BBGe Rs156bn, +46% YoY, -7% QoQ), YoY rise primarily led by rise in GMM. Standalone PAT came in at Rs56.9bn (Ple Rs92.9bn, BBGe Rs86.3bn). Petrochem EBIT stood at a loss of Rs10.2mn. While GRMs remain subdued at ~USD3/bbl, benign crude oil prices are expected to keep GMMs strong. We build in a GRM of USD4.7/5/6/bbl forFY25/26/27E. On the marketing front, we build in a GMM of Rs6.5/4.8/4.8/lit for FY25/26/27E. Outlook Due to correction in stock price combined with strength in GMMs and compensation of LPG underrecoveries, we upgrade the stock from ‘Reduce’ to ‘Accumulate’ rating on the stock with a TP of Rs152 (earlier TP Rs138) based on 1.0x FY27E P/BV.

""The EoI part of the process has been fully completed, the qualified parties have been through a provisional fit and proper assessment by the RBI. They are now doing the due diligence, and all details have been made available through the data room. We are in an advanced stage of completing the due diligence exercise and further steps, essentially the RFP stage, we hope to complete by the end of the financial year,"" Arunish Chawla told CNBC-TV18 during an interaction. DIPAM said all necessary details relating to the divestment have been shared with the qualified bidders, and the technical document for the divestment is ready now. The stake sale process, which is likely to conclude this fiscal, includes divestment of LIC's stake in the lender. Centre has already completed Rs 20,000 crore worth of divestment during Q1FY26 out of the targetted Rs 47,000 crore for the fiscal. The IDBI Bank stake sale, after multiple delays, is moving forward and is considered as key to government's broader divestment strategy. The government and the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) jointly own 95 percent of IDBI Bank, of which 60.72 percent stake is earmarked for sale under the ongoing disinvestment programme. The Centre has been working on the share purchase agreement with potential buyers and will be seeking approval from the ministerial panel overseeing the deal. IDBI Bank shares have surged 27 percent year-to-date, vastly outperforming the Nifty 50 index’s 5.5 percent rise."

Earlier this week, founder and chairman Bhavish Aggarwal laid out an ambitious growth strategy at the company’s annual Sankalp event. Ola is aiming for a 25-30 percent share in India's two-wheeler electric vehicle market, backed by vertical integration and new product launches. ""Our target market share for two-wheeler EVs is about 25 to 30 percent with very high margins, so we believe we are on the trajectory again,"" Aggarwal said. He added that Ola's 'mojo is still there' despite the challenges faced during its transition phase. Aggarwal also stressed that profitability in electric vehicles requires more than just scale. “No one is making money. To make money with EVs, you need vertical integration, you need the technology development, you need the DNA of technology,” Aggarwal said. Ola Electric reported a weak first quarter compared to last year, though results were better when compared sequentially. The electric two-wheeler maker posted a consolidated net loss of Rs 428 crore in Q1FY26 as against a loss of Rs 870 crore in Q4FY25 and Rs 347 crore in Q1FY25. Revenue for the quarter fell to Rs 828 crore, marking a 49.6 percent year-on-year (YoY) decline from Rs 1,644 crore.

The company's Gross margin expanded 630 basis points to 35.5% in 1Q FY26, which is attributed to stabilizing input costs. The company anticipates similar gross margins for the rest of FY26.

After a 17% correction in the share price over the last 12M, valuations at 11x FY27 P/E appear relatively reasonable, even as the long-term project pipeline continues to build up, supported by an expanding footprint in nuclear, PSP, renewables, and green chemicals. However, we maintain a cautious view on execution, especially at NGEL, even though management has guided that 87/80% of capacity slated to be commissioned in FY26/27 already has PPAs tied up. Further, we believe valuations for NGEL (15% of our SOTP) have little room for re-rating and may continue to face pressure. Lastly, we believe the FY27E dividend yield of 2.9% remains modest and lower than peers such as PWGR (FY27: 3.4%). Outlook Our TP of INR380 for NTPC is based on: Value of INR219 for the standalone, coal, and other businesses at Mar’27E P/B of 2.2x.

Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates ""A striking divergence has emerged between India and the U.S. markets. While worries over sticky inflation are dragging Wall Street lower, Indian equities continue to hold firm, supported by bold reform measures and steady fund inflows. Softer retail inflation at 1.55 percent in July has also raised hopes of another rate cut by the MPC, though the RBI remains cautious amid global uncertainty,"" V K Vijayakumar of Geojit Investments Ltd said. He added that valuations, however, remain a key concern. Large-cap valuations appear justified by India’s long-term growth story, and midcaps are backed by healthy earnings momentum. But smallcaps look stretched, making them the riskiest segment of the market.

Realty led the pack with a 1.1 percent gain, followed by pharma, up 0.9 percent, and oil & gas, which rose 0.6 percent. The smallcap and midcap indices also outperformed, advancing 0.7 percent and 0.3 percent, respectively. Among other gainers, metals added 0.4 percent, infrastructure 0.4 percent, IT 0.3 percent, and banking stocks posted modest gains, with the Nifty Bank and private bank indices higher by 0.3 percent each. On the flip side, FMCG slipped 0.6 percent, while auto was flat, down 0.1 percent. Trouble continued for Nazara Technologies' stock, which tumbled another 8 percent, after the Lok Sabha passed the Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Bill, 2025. The bill aims to prohibit all pay-to-play online games, including both games of skill and chance. If passed, the bill would pause the total operations of regulated real-money gaming (RMG) platforms across India. Bajaj Finserv rose 2 percent after global brokerage Jefferies initiated coverage with 'Buy' call and gave a target of Rs 2,420 per share. The target implies up to 22 percent upside potential from the current market price. Bajaj Finserv to benefit from lower rates, stronger BALIC (Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Company Limited) profits and BAGIC (Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Company Limited) growth, Jefferies said. Insurance players saw some cheer in trade on Thursday, August 21, after reports suggested that life and health insurance purchased by individuals may be exempt from the 18 percent Goods and Services Tax (GST) that is currently levied. The GST Group of Ministers (GoM) on insurance has proposed that health and life insurance premiums be exempted from the levy, in a move aimed at making insurance products more affordable and improving penetration in India’s underinsured market.

"Real estate stocks jump up to 3%, extend gains for 4th day: What's driving the rally?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/real-estate-stocks-jump-up-to-3-extend-gains-for-4th-day-what-s-driving-the-rally-13474728.html,"The shares of real estate companies recorded notable gains on August 21, buoyed by multiple factors. The sharp rise in the share prices pushed the Nifty Realty index up over 1 percent to hover around 923 in the morning. The realty index has now extended gains for the fourth consecutive session. Here are the likely triggers pushing the real estate stocks up: 'Listed developers are well-positioned for sustained growth': Listed residential developers delivered their strongest-ever quarter in Q1 of the financial year 2026, said Pankaj Kumar, VP-Fundamental Research, Kotak Securities. ""With a robust ~Rs 1.8 lakh crore launch pipeline, strong balance sheets, and low leverage, listed developers are well-positioned for sustained growth and market share gains. Valuations for most residential real estate stocks stand at 7-10X adjusted EV/EBITDA (FY27E). Despite moderating industry volume trends, we remain constructive on listed developers, driven by geographical expansion and market share gains,"" he added. Kotak Securities named DLF, Brigade Enterprises, Lodha, and Prestige Estates as its preferred picks in the sector. Rate cut expectations: The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) kept its repo rate unchanged during the last meeting in August. Repo rates directly influence home loan interest rates, affecting EMIs and loan costs. Hence, no rate cut had dampened sentiment in the sector, pushing the stocks down significantly earlier this month. However, several analysts now expect RBI to deliver a repo rate cut during its upcoming meeting scheduled for October. ""While concerns of potential rising inflation in the U.S. is weighing on the market there, the bold reform initiatives in India and the sustained money flows into the market are imparting resilience to the market. With retail inflation in India remaining much lower than expected (1.55% in July) another rate cut by the MPC is possible soon even though the RBI is cautious in the context of heightened global uncertainty,"" said VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments. The expectations of a rate cut may have further fuelled the optimism in the real estate sector. GST reforms: While delivering his Independence Day speech, Prime Minister Narendra Modi hinted at the next generation of Goods and Services Tax (GST) reforms to be announced as a Diwali gift for consumers. The Centre has proposed to move towards ""simple tax"" with 2 slabs—""standard and merit"", with special rates applicable for only for select few items. This will likely reduce tax burden on consumers, thereby increasing discretionary spending limit, which in turn may boost housing demand. Value buying: The sharp rise in the share prices also comes after a strong correction. After hitting a record high in June, the Nifty Realty index tumbled nearly 17 percent in just two months to hit a low of nearly 871 in August. The sharp correction may have made the stocks attractive for investors at the current levels. The index has now risen nearly 6 percent in eight sessions. Anant Raj shares were the top gainer on the index, rising more than 3 percent to trade at Rs 555 apiece. Prestige Estates and Sobha shares were up around 2 percent each, while Godrej Properties, Macrotech Developers (Lodha), DLF and Oberoi Realty shares gained around 1 percent each. Brigade Enterprises and Phoenix Mills shares were trading in the green with marginal gains. Bucking the trend, Raymond shares were down over 1 percent to trade at Rs 643 apiece.

"Prince Pipes rallies 6 percent on improved outlook, Motilal Oswal says sector on the cusp of recovery",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/prince-pipes-rallies-6-percent-on-improved-outlook-motilal-oswal-says-sector-on-the-cusp-of-recovery-13474762.html,"Shares of Prince Pipes are sharply higher by 6 percent in trade after a Motilal Oswal note said on August 21 that the sector is poised for recovery following DGTR's recent recommendation for an anti-dumping duty and prices of PVC stabilizing at lower levels. MOSL in its note observed that the companies in the sector are looking ripe for a volume recovery in the July-August period, and are retaining their FY26 guidance as the demand outlook seems to be improving. ""Though 1QFY26 was weighed down by weak macros, muted demand, and inventory losses from PVC volatility, we expect the PVC pipes industry to see a gradual recovery from 2QFY26 (on a low base), with a further pickup in momentum from 2HFY26,"" said the MOSL note. This recovery is likely to be supported by improving PVC prices, which will lead to restocking, supported by Centre's infrastructure push and improving housing demand. Prince Pipes had posted a muted quarter as volatile pricing and the early monsoon had dampened demand. The management has anticipated a gradual demand recovery for the rest of FY26, with a high single-to-low double-digit volume growth for the year. The bathware segment is expected to generate Rs 50-60 crore in revenue and could break-even by mid-FY27, according to the company, with plans of expasion in the southern and eastern markets in this segment. The company is expanding its eighth manufacturing facility which is expected to be completed by Q2FY26. ""We expect Prince Pipes to clock 14%/37%/71% CAGR in revenue/EBITDA/PAT over FY25-28. We value the stock at 30x FY27 EPS to arrive at our target of Rs 440,"" said MOSL. Read More The PVC pipe industry is coming out of a year that saw inflationary pressures and subdued demand across segments, with a reduction in government's infrastructure spending, leading to caution in inventory optimization by channel partners. An increased volatility in PVC resin prices too dampened volume growth and profitability across the industry. Going forward, the management is confident of 'high single-digit to low double-digit' growth for the rest of the year. Prince Pipes also said it is focusing on geographical expansion and innovation to navigate the market uncertainties. ""Looking ahead, we are optimistic about a gradual recovery in demand, supported by the government's renewed thrust on infrastructure spending,"" Parag Chheda, Joint MD of Price Pipes said during the June quarter earnings call. The stock is down 19 percent on a YTD basis but has rebounded by close to 18 percent in the last five trading sessions. Prince Pipes has a near 5 percent share in PVC pipes segment and is among the top six players in the industry that is increasingly getting organised.

According to the brokerage, the recent decline in Hexaware’s stock after soft Q2CY25 earnings has created a favourable entry point. “The CMP offers an excellent opportunity to own a high-quality business at an inexpensive valuation,” it said, adding that the stock trades at 28x and 24x its CY26 and CY27 earnings, in line with peers such as LTIMindtree and Mphasis.

"Interglobe Aviation shares slip 2% as Kotak downgrades stock to ""add"" amid capacity cuts",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/interglobe-aviation-shares-slip-2-as-kotak-downgrades-stock-to-add-amid-capacity-cuts-13474523.html,"Shares of InterGlobe Aviation, the operator of IndiGo, fell 2 percent to Rs 6,010 apiece on August 21 after Kotak Institutional Equities downgraded the stock to “add”, even as it maintained a target price of Rs 6,850, implying an upside potential of 14 percent from current levels. Kotak noted that recent data indicates the impact of IndiGo’s capacity cuts, which seem to be occurring at a slightly faster pace than its key competitor. However, the brokerage clarified, “We would not take this as a sign of weakening demand.” According to Kotak, the airline is phasing out damp leases and possibly deferring new aircraft deliveries during what is traditionally a loss-making quarter. Unlike its earlier approach of adding capacity in Q2 ahead of strong Q3 and Q4 demand, IndiGo is now focusing on measures to support yield growth during the festive season. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog Kotak further highlighted that airlines aim to avoid setting low yields as the new norm, particularly when most carriers are operating at a loss. Despite falling crude prices, yields have remained flat for the past three years, which Kotak described as a “commendable feat.” The brokerage expects carriers to push for year-on-year yield growth in the upcoming festive season. As part of its capacity adjustments, IndiGo has reduced its average monthly flight count to around 2,000 for the current months, representing a decline of 11 percent compared to Q4FY25 and 9 percent compared to Q1FY26. By comparison, Air India has reduced its flights by 10 percent and 8 percent, respectively. For the June quarter, IndiGo reported a net profit of Rs 2,176 crore, down 20.2 percent from Rs 2,728 crore in the corresponding period last year. Revenue rose 4.7 percent year-on-year to Rs 20,496 crore, but missed the estimated Rs 21,150 crore. EBITDA increased marginally by 1 percent year-on-year to Rs 5,226 crore, while the operating margin slipped to 25.5 percent from 26.4 percent a year earlier.

Notably, major call writers have begun shifting their positions to higher strikes, adding further conviction to the bullish structure.

A total of 1,553 shares saw buying interest, compared to 1,164 shares that were under pressure on the NSE. The market may retain its gradual upward trajectory, given healthy technical indicators. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Nilesh Jain, Head – Technical and Derivatives Research Analyst (Equity Research) at Centrum Broking Tata Consumer Products | CMP: Rs 1,105.3 Tata Consumer has given a breakout from a falling wedge pattern on the daily chart, indicating a bullish reversal. It has also crossed above all key short-term and long-term moving averages, further strengthening the positive outlook. We anticipate the stock to surpass the immediate resistance at Rs 1,110 and move towards the Rs 1,170 level in the near term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,170 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,068 Jindal Steel and Power | CMP: Rs 1,016.3 Jindal Steel continues to find support along its rising trendline and recently achieved a multi-month breakout above the Rs 1,008 level. It is trading firmly above all key short-term and long-term moving averages, reflecting strong underlying strength. Moreover, momentum indicators and oscillators on the daily chart have confirmed a bullish crossover, reinforcing the positive bias. Given this setup, we expect the stock to move towards a new all-time high near Rs 1,100 in the near term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,100 Stop-Loss: Rs 975 Cummins India | CMP: Rs 3,318.4 Cummins India is forming a saucer bottom pattern on the chart, signaling a gradual accumulation phase and potential trend reversal. On the derivatives front, a strong buildup of long positions indicates positive market sentiment. Furthermore, momentum indicators and oscillators remain in buy mode on both the daily and weekly charts. Considering this technical setup, the stock is poised for continued upside in the short term, and adopting a buy-on-dips approach is advisable. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 4,100 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,650 Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical Research and Derivatives at SBI Securities Mphasis | CMP: Rs 2,835.5 On Wednesday, the Nifty IT index emerged as a clear outperformer among frontline indices, registering a robust gain of over 2.7%. This marks a significant technical development, as the index has decisively crossed above its 20-day EMA for the first time since July 9, indicating a potential shift in short-term momentum. Among individual stocks, Mphasis stood out with a breakout from a symmetrical triangle pattern on the daily chart. This breakout is backed by a noticeable increase in trading volumes, lending credibility to the move and suggesting strong market participation. Technically, the stock is now trading above both its short-term and long-term moving averages. Momentum indicators are also supporting the bullish narrative. The daily RSI is on the verge of crossing the 60 mark, and its upward trajectory reflects improving strength in price action. This confluence of price breakout, volume confirmation, and supportive trend and momentum indicators suggests that Mphasis may be poised for further upside in the near term. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the Rs 2,840-2,820 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,050 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,740 Swiggy | CMP: Rs 421 Swiggy marked a swing high of Rs 429.90 on July 24, and thereafter witnessed a minor correction. During this phase, volume activity remained mostly below average—indicating a lack of aggressive selling pressure and suggesting the correction was a healthy consolidation. The correction halted near the 100-day EMA, after which the stock has resumed its upward movement. Currently, Swiggy is on the verge of a Stage-2 Cup pattern breakout on the daily chart—a bullish continuation pattern that typically signals the start of a fresh uptrend. Notably, Wednesday’s trading session saw volumes rise above the 50-day average, a sign of accumulation and growing investor interest ahead of the breakout. Technically, the stock is trading above all its key moving averages, which are aligned in a bullish sequence, further reinforcing trend strength. Momentum indicators are supportive—the daily RSI is in bullish territory and continues to rise, indicating improving price strength. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the Rs 425-420 range. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 460 Stop-Loss: Rs 408 FACT | CMP: Rs 1,014.5 Fertilizers and Chemicals Travancore has shown encouraging price action by establishing a strong base near its 100-day EMA, which acted as a key support during the recent consolidation. Following this base formation, the stock witnessed a sharp rebound, supported by higher-than-average volumes—indicating renewed buying interest and improving sentiment. Currently, the stock is trading over 10% above its 100-day EMA and more than 12% above its 200-day EMA, underscoring the strength of the ongoing uptrend. This significant distance from key moving averages reflects strong bullish momentum, suggesting the stock is comfortably within a well-defined upward trajectory. Adding to the positive setup, the daily RSI has surged past the 60 mark for the first time since June 2025, signaling a shift in momentum and validating the current rally. Hence, we recommend accumulating in the Rs 1,020-1,010 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,100 Stop-Loss: Rs 980 Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities Infosys | CMP: Rs 1,496 For the first time in several sessions, Infosys managed to reclaim the 21-EMA on the daily chart.

"Sebi close to finalising block deal norms, with higer price range and deal size",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sebi-close-to-finalising-revamped-block-deal-norms-with-higer-price-range-and-deal-size-13473305.html,"Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is likely to finalise the framework for block deals soon, including tweaking the reference price range and increasing the minimum order size. Sebi had formed a working group which shared its recommendations recently. With inputs from market participants, Sebi is expected to finalise the framework soon. The block deal mechanism allows pre-negotiated deals between parties to be executed on the exchange within designated windows and under strict rules to prevent price manipulation. Moneycontrol had previously reported on May 27 that block deals could get a makeover, and on August 11 that the Sebi working group had proposed a broader price range and higher order size. The Higher Price Range for Block Deals As per sources, Sebi may come up with two kinds of price ranges for block deals. Stocks which are available for trading in the Futures & Options (F&O) segment may remain within the plus and minus 1 percent price range of the applicable reference price. Non-F&O segment stocks may be placed under the plus and minus 3 percent price range of the reference price. A working group formed on the issue had suggested a price range of 5 percent for the morning block deal window and a 3 percent price range for the afternoon trading window, though one of the exchanges had suggested a plus and minus 2 percent price range. NSE data for FY25 suggested that around 66 percent of block deals happened in non-F&O stocks. Higher Order Threshold Similarly, the minimum order size is likely to be revised to Rs 25 crore instead of the current Rs 10 crore. The working group had recommended that the limit should be hiked, and the rationale was that benchmark indices have increased nearly three times over the last 10 years. So, with the growth in the size and depth of markets, it is desirable that limits be increased. Higher Order Size based on Data Study Sebi also analysed the data of block deals of FY25 at NSE and concluded that 90 percent of block deals were of the size above Rs 14 crore, 75 percent above Rs 26 crore, 60 percent above Rs 50 crore, and 50 percent above Rs 84 crore. So, the need was felt to review the order size. Sebi had last tweaked the order size in October 2017. One market participant, on the condition of anonymity, said, “The higher threshold is expected to bring liquidity, as the orders below Rs 25 crore will take place in the normal market.” The Sebi working group was of the view that raising the order size limit would ensure participation mainly from serious institutional investors, not high-net-worth individuals or family offices, who bypass the main market via block deals.

The Sebi working group was of the view that it should be common across windows. Currently, the morning window’s reference price duration (8:45–9:00 am) is based on the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) of the last 30 minutes of trades from the previous day’s close. But the afternoon window’s reference price duration (2:05–2:20 pm) uses the VWAP of trades executed in the stock between 1:45 pm and 2:00 pm. OFS-like Mechanism as an Alternative to Block Deals It is also being discussed with stakeholders such as exchanges, clearing corporations, mutual funds, and brokers that a simplified version of the Offer for Sale (OFS)-like mechanism can be introduced for non-promoter shareholders. It will act as an alternative to the block deal mechanism. Though, it may take longer time to materialize. The mechanism of block deals was introduced by Sebi in 2005 and is primarily used by institutional investors such as mutual funds and insurance companies to execute large trades without disturbing the market price. An email seeking comments from Sebi on the proposed changes, did not elicit any response.
