Option trading for range-bound market: Shubham Agarwal,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/expert-columns/option-trading-for-range-bound-market-shubham-agarwal-13364809.html,"It is worrisome when the major index like Nifty is changed by a little over a percent in the last 3 months. The volatility has been there, but that too in a good 3-4% range. These are the times when a simple Buy and Hold strategy can get frustrating. In such times of range-bound movement, especially, initiating a bearish trade after a big fall feels like going against the trend. The risk of indices and stocks getting back into the range is very high. So essentially, we need a trade that does not hurt us if the very short-term trend ends right after we take the trade. At the same time, we need not miss the opportunity nor be too protective. Detect a range-bound market with the following 3 characteristics visible in the equities market. 1. The Highs and Lows made a few weeks back have not been broken (and sustained)2. Open Interest in Nifty Calls and Puts is almost equal (Publicly available information on NSE website)3. India VIX has dropped in the last few weeksAs soon as it is established, we can treat and trade such market conditions like a range-bound market. Trading Technique #1 Put a Butterfly in place in Nifty Creating this strategy is simple. Sell Both Call & Put of a strike closest to the current level of the index. Being an index, it is likely to be less volatile, and liquidity is enough as well. However, since selling options has an unknown risk profile, we will add a couple of more options to this. I always buy Protection. Along with the Sell Options, Buy a Higher Strike Call Option and a Lower Strike Put Option. An easy way to choose the strike is that the difference between the Buy strikes could be equal to the total premium received by selling options. Example: Index at 1000Sell 1000 Call @ 50Sell 1000 Put @ 50Total Premium received 100Buy 1100 Call & Buy 900 Put for Protection. Maximum Profit would be the net premium received, and maximum Loss would be the difference between Buy strike & Sell Strike minus the Net Premium received. It’s always better to get this economics right before entering the trade. Trading Technique #2 As far as individual stocks are concerned, we can resort to options there as well. However, we need to keep in mind that there will be a lack of big moves, so adjust the trades accordingly. Also, care must be taken for the fact that stocks and indices could keep moving down from the upper end of the range and moving up from the lower end. To handle this:1. While trading stock options, we could keep our price target and stop losses smaller.2. Take trades in single Options (Buy Call/Put) for 1 -2 days3. When we are close to a recent high, have a mix of Buy Call & Buy Put (Bullish & Bearish) trades Range-bound market has an attractive characteristic of not having to commit to the trade for a longer period. History says that many small trades do improve the probability of profit. So, range-bound markets are also equally profitable if traded effectively using Options.

"Stocks slump on latest tariffs, soft jobs data",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/stocks-slump-on-latest-tariffs-soft-jobs-data-13375128.html,"US stocks slumped on Friday, and the S&P suffered its biggest daily percentage decline in more than two months as new U.S. tariffs on dozens of trading partners and a surprisingly weak jobs report spurred selling pressure. Also weighing on equities was an 8.3% tumble in Amazon.com shares after the company posted quarterly results but failed to meet lofty expectations for its Amazon Web Services cloud computing unit. Just hours before the tariff deadline on Friday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order imposing duties on U.S. imports from countries, including Canada, Brazil, India and Taiwan, in his latest round of levies as countries attempted to seek ways to reach better deals. Further denting confidence in the economic picture, data showed U.S. job growth slowed more than expected in July while the prior month's report was revised sharply lower, indicating the labor market may be starting to crack. The report significantly pushed up expectations the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its September meeting. ""There’s no way to pretty-up this report. Previous months were revised significantly lower where the labor market has been on stall-speed,"" said Brian Jacobsen, Chief Economist at Annex Wealth Management in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin. ""Last year the Fed messed up by not cutting in July so they did a catch-up cut at their next meeting. They’ll likely have to do the same thing this year."" Market expectations the Fed will cut rates by at least 25 basis points at its September meeting stood at 86.5%, according to CME's FedWatch Tool, opens new tab, up from 37.7% in the prior session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 542.40 points, or 1.23%, to 43,588.58, the S&P 500 lost 101.38 points, or 1.60%, to 6,238.01 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 472.32 points, or 2.24%, to 20,650.13. The S&P 500 recorded its biggest single-day percentage decline since May 21 while the Nasdaq suffered its biggest daily percentage drop since April 21. For the week, the S&P 500 fell 2.36%, the Nasdaq declined 2.17%, and the Dow fell 2.92%. The CBOE Volatility Index, also known as Wall Street's fear gauge, closed up 3.66 points at 20.38, its highest close since June 20. Amazon was the biggest drag on the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq and pushed the consumer discretionary index (.SPLRCD), opens new tab, down nearly 3.6% as the worst performing of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors. Also reporting earnings was Apple which lost 2.5% after it posted a current-quarter revenue forecast well above Wall Street estimates, but CEO Tim Cook warned U.S. tariffs would add $1.1 billion in costs over the period. Stocks briefly extended declines after Trump said he ordered the commissioner of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Erika L. McEntarfer, to be fired in the wake of the jobs data. ""(Trump) didn't seem to be disappointed with the last five jobs reports,"" said Art Hogan, Chief Market Strategist, B. Riley Wealth, Boston, saying that the firing stood out as irregular. ""I think this is clearly something that happens in dictatorships, not in democracies.” The Federal Reserve said Governor Adriana Kugler is resigning early from her term and will exit the central bank on Aug. 8, enabling President Donald Trump to select a new governor as he has ramped up pressure against Chair Jerome Powell recently to cut interest rates. Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2.17-to-1 ratio on the NYSE, and by a 2.69-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P 500 posted eight new 52-week highs and 29 new lows, while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 29 new highs and 202 new lows. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 19.51 billion shares, compared with the 18.44 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days."
"Chartist Talk: Sudeep Shah shares 2 buy and 2 sell picks amid market caution; Nifty at risk below 24,400",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/chartist-talk-this-vp-shares-2-buy-and-2-sell-picks-amid-market-caution-nifty-at-risk-below-24-400-13373897.html,"The Nifty now traded below its 20-day, 50-day, and even 100-day EMA, and daily RSI fell below the 40 mark, signalling the bearish sentiment. Hence, the caution is advised and the 24,400-24,350 is expected to be crucial for further downside in the Nifty 50, said Sudeep Shah, Vice President and Head of Technical and Derivative Research at SBI Securities in an interview to Moneycontrol. Amid market caution, he advised two buy (Emami and Jindal Stainless) and two sell picks (Tata Steel and Aurobindo Pharma) for the next week. With this week's rally, Emami has managed to reclaim both its short-term and long-term moving averages, reinforcing the positive shift in momentum, while on Friday, Jindal Stainless gave a Symmetrical Triangle breakout on the daily scale which is confirmed by robust volume. Further, Aurobindo Pharma on Friday has given an upward sloping trendline breakdown on a daily scale accompained by robust volume, while Tata Steel slipped below its 100-day EMA level on Friday, which is a bearish sign, Sudeep reasoned. Do you see the Nifty easily breaking below its 200-day EMA in the coming week? The benchmark index Nifty wrapped up its fifth consecutive week in the red — its longest losing streak since August 2023, raising eyebrows across the street. What adds to the concern is the back-to-back formation of bearish candles with long upper shadows on the weekly chart. This pattern is a classic sign of rejection at higher levels. Despite making multiple attempts to scale up, the index has struggled to hold ground, only to be met with selling pressure each time. The long upper wicks are a telling story — bulls tried, but bears had the final say. It reflects a market that’s finding it hard to build on gains, weighed down by renewed supply pressure, and a cautious sentiment hovering overhead. Several factors have contributed to this shift in tone — from renewed concerns around the progress of India–US trade negotiations, to persistent FII outflows, and a string of underwhelming corporate earnings that failed to meet market expectations. The broader markets weren’t spared either. Both the Nifty Midcap and Nifty Small Cap 100 indices came under notable selling pressure and have now underperformed the frontline index for the second consecutive week. Adding to the concern, the ratio charts comparing these broader indices to the Nifty have slipped to their lowest levels in nearly two months, pointing to deteriorating relative strength and increasing caution among market participants when it comes to mid and small-cap exposures. Technically, Nifty is now trading below its 20-day, 50-day, and even 100-day EMA — a sign of mounting weakness. The daily RSI has dipped below the 40 mark and continues to trend lower, reinforcing the underlying bearish momentum. Talking about key levels, the zone of 24,400–24,350 is expected to act as an immediate support for Nifty. A sustained break below this could further accelerate the downside. On the flip side, the 50-day EMA zone of 24,900–24,950 now stands as a crucial hurdle, and any meaningful recovery would need to clear this zone with conviction. Looking at the medium-term structure, the 24,000–23,900 zone holds even greater significance. This area is likely to serve as a vital support base, and any breach below it could lead to a deeper corrective phase in the index. Despite its recent outperformance relative to the Nifty 50, do you expect the Bank Nifty to extend its downtrend and test the June lows as well as the 100-day EMA? The banking benchmark index, Bank Nifty, traded within a narrow range of 2,081 points during July — its tightest monthly range since July 2023. After posting gains for four consecutive months, the index finally snapped its winning streak and closed the July month on a negative note. On the monthly chart, Bank Nifty has formed a bearish candle, indicating a loss of momentum and a potential pause in the prevailing uptrend. At present, the index is trading below both its 20-day and 50-day exponential moving averages, with both averages exhibiting a downward slope — a sign of prevailing weakness. Additionally, the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) has slipped below the 40 mark and continues to trend lower, reflecting fading momentum and increasing bearish pressure. The daily MACD stays bearish as it is quoting below its zero line and signal line. The MACD histogram is suggesting a pickup in downside momentum. Going ahead, the zone of 55,200-55,100 will act as an important support for the index. If the index slips below the 55,100 level, then the next crucial support is placed at the 54,600 level. On the upside, the zone of 56,300-56,400 will act as an immediate hurdle for the index. Do you anticipate the rally in Suzlon Energy and Kaynes Technology India to continue in the coming week? Yes, based on the recent price action and technical indicators, the rally in both Suzlon Energy and Kaynes Technology India appears poised to extend into the coming week. During the previous week, both stocks took strong support near their respective 200-day EMA — a key long-term trend indicator closely tracked by market participants. This support acted as a springboard for a sharp and decisive rebound. What adds conviction to this recovery is the surge in trading volumes, which confirms that the rebound is backed by strong market participation and not merely a technical pullback. Moreover, both counters are now trading comfortably above their key short and medium-term moving averages, reinforcing the strength of the ongoing uptrend. In addition, momentum indicators such as the RSI and MACD are showing signs of continued bullish traction, indicating sustained buying interest. Given these favourable technical signals, we expect both Suzlon Energy and Kaynes Technology India to maintain their positive momentum and continue to outperform in the short term, provided broader market conditions remain stable. Which two stocks would you prefer to bet on for the upcoming week? Emami The Nifty FMCG has strongly outperformed frontline indices in the last week. The stock of Emami has found strong support near its upward-sloping trendline, which has been intact since April 2023 by connecting key swing lows. Following this retest, the stock witnessed a sharp upside rally, indicating a solid reversal from the support zone — a move that was further validated by robust volume participation, adding strength to the price action. With this upmove, the stock has managed to reclaim both its short-term and long-term moving averages, reinforcing the positive shift in momentum. Additionally, the daily RSI has surged past the 60 mark and is trending higher, signaling growing bullish strength and increasing buying interest. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 620-615 level with a stop-loss of Rs 595 level. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 660 in the short term. Jindal Stainless On Friday, the stock gave a Symmetrical Triangle breakout on the daily scale. This breakout is confirmed by robust volume. Currently, the stock is trading above its short and long-term moving averages. These averages are in rising mode, and they are in the desired sequence, which reinforces the strength of the ongoing trend. The daily RSI has surged above the 60 mark, and it is in rising mode, suggesting sustained momentum and increasing bullish sentiment. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 710-700 level with a stop-loss of Rs 680 level. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 760 in the short term. Are you particularly bullish on GE Vernova T&D and Radico Khaitan, given their continued higher highs and higher low formation? What are your price targets for both in August? GE Vernova T&D While GE Vernova T&D has displayed remarkable strength in recent sessions, locking in upper circuits for the past three consecutive trading days. Going ahead, it is important to exercise caution at this juncture. The stock has already witnessed a steep vertical rally, and its daily RSI is now approaching the overbought territory, indicating stretched short-term momentum. In such scenarios, the risk-reward becomes unfavourable for fresh entries. Hence, we advise avoiding any immediate exposure to the stock until it cools off or offers a healthy consolidation. Radico Khaitan Radico Khaitan has shown encouraging technical strength by breaking out of a consolidation pattern on the daily chart in Friday’s session. The breakout was supported by decent volumes, which is a positive sign. However, after touching an intraday high of Rs 2,940, the stock faced some profit booking, ultimately forming a bullish candle with a long upper shadow. This suggests selling pressure at higher levels. For the stock to resume its upward trajectory convincingly, it must sustain above Rs 2,900 mark. If that level is reclaimed and held, we expect Radico Khaitan to potentially move towards Rs 3,025–3,075 in August, provided market sentiment remains supportive. Considering the current market weakness, are there any two stocks you'd look to short in the coming week, and what’s your rationale? Aurobindo Pharma The stock has strongly underperformed the Nifty Pharma index in the last couple of months. On Friday, the stock has given an upward sloping trendline breakdown on a daily scale. This breakdown is confirmed by robust volume. Also, it is trading below its crucial moving averages. The daily RSI has given a breakdown of upward sloping trendline. Hence, we believe the stock is likely to continue its southward journey and test the level of Rs 1,000 in the short term. Tata Steel The stock has slipped below its 100-day EMA level on Friday, which is a bearish sign. In the recent pullback, the daily RSI has failed to cross 60 mark and thereafter slipped below 40 mark, which is a bearish sign as per RSI range shift rules. The daily MACD histogram is suggesting pickup in downside momentum. Hence, we believe it is likely to continue its southward journey and test the level of 145 in the short term.

"Taking Stock: Nifty below 24,600 in fifth week of fall, big selloff in pharma",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/taking-stock-nifty-below-24-600-in-fifth-week-of-fall-big-selloff-in-pharma-13367331.html,"Benchmark indices ended lower for a second consecutive session on August 1, marking the fifth week of losses, with Nifty closing below 24,600 on the first day of the August series, as selling across sectors weighed on the sentiment, majorly in pharma names. This has been the longest weekly losing streak in two years for Nifty 50. Tracking weak global cues, the indices had opened lower but recovered, however, a mid-session profit booking and extended selloff in the final hour dragged Nifty below 24,550, ending near day's low. At close, the Sensex was down 585.67 points or 0.72 percent at 80,599.91, and the Nifty was down 203 points or 0.82 percent at 24,565.35. The broader indices underperformed, with BSE Midcap index down 1.3 percent and Smallcap index lower by 1.6 percent. For the week, BSE Sensex and Nifty slipped by a percent each.

Click to View More Outlook for August 4 Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities Nifty witnessed another sharp decline as it failed to reclaim the 200-DMA on the hourly chart, despite a strong recovery on Thursday. Throughout the day, the index remained below the 50-EMA on the hourly timeframe. On the daily chart, it has broken below the recent consolidation support at 24,600. Sentiment remains weak, with the potential for the correction to extend towards 24,400–24,450. A further decline is likely if it slips below 24,400; otherwise, a recovery can be expected. On the higher side, resistance is seen at 24,600–24,650 and 24,850. Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets began the August series on a negative note, extending the prevailing corrective trend, and ended lower by over half a percent. The first half of the session remained range-bound, with Nifty oscillating in a narrow band. However, selling pressure in heavyweights during the final hours dragged the index below its medium-term moving average—the 100-day EMA—near the 24,600 mark, eventually settling at 24,565.35. On the sectoral front, pharma, metal, and IT were among the top losers. The broader indices also witnessed sharp cuts, each losing nearly 1.5%, resulting in a significant decline in market breadth. Markets continue to grapple with a mixed earnings season, while the recent tariff announcement and persistent foreign fund outflows are further weighing on sentiment. Nifty is now approaching its next crucial support at 24,450; a breach of this level could trigger a retest of the long-term moving average, the 200-day EMA, near 24,180. On the upside, the 24,800–25,000 zone is expected to act as a strong hurdle. We maintain our cautious stance and continue to recommend a hedged approach with a negative bias until clear signs of reversal emerge. Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities After showing high volatility on Thursday, Nifty slipped into a sharp weakness amidst choppy movement on Friday and closed the day lower by 203 points. A long negative candle was formed on the daily chart on Friday at the new swing lows beside the long bull candle of previous session. Technically, this market action is suggesting inherent weakness in the market to sustain the bounces. Nifty is currently placed near the crucial support of around 24500 levels (multiple swing lows of May-June 25), but the sustainable recovery has not emerged from near the supports so far. Bearish lower highs and lower lows pattern is intact on the daily chart. Nifty on the weekly chart formed a reasonable negative candle this week, which is for the fifth consecutive bearish candle formation on the trot. The previous sharp upside breakout of larger range movement of last month has been completely negated and the market slipped below the immediate support zone of 24600 mark. The underlying trend of Nifty remains weak. A decisive move below the support of 24500, Nifty could slide down towards the next lower area of 24100-24000 levels in the near term. Immediate resistance is placed at 24950 levels. Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

"Markets slide for second session amid global weakness, tariff Concerns",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/markets-slide-for-second-session-amid-global-weakness-tariff-concerns-13369060.html,"Indian equity benchmarks ended lower for a second consecutive session on August 1, mirroring global market weakness as heightened US tariffs dampened investor sentiment. At close, the Sensex fell 0.5 percent, shedding 420 points to end at 80,761.70, while the Nifty declined 0.61 percent or 151 points to settle at 24,620. Asian markets were largely in the red, with indices in South Korea, Japan, China and Hong Kong trading lower. The negative trend followed weak closing on Wall Street, and US futures indicating a subdued start, further dampening investor confidence. ""Investor sentiment weakened further as FIIs now hold the second-highest net short position in derivatives, reflecting elevated caution. Globally, markets turned negative amid rising U.S. inflation and trade tensions. While the sell-off was broad-based, FMCG stocks emerged as a defensive play, supported by attractive valuations, resilient demand, and relative immunity to external trade disruptions"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments Sectoral indices were broadly in the red, with Nifty Pharma emerging as the biggest loser, dropping 3.3 percent following US President Donald Trump’s call for drugmakers to slash prices. Nifty IT and Nifty Metal also saw sharp declines, each down over 1.5 percent, while Nifty Realty and Nifty Auto slipped 1.3 percent and 0.6 percent, respectively. The broader market sentiment took a hit after President Trump imposed a 25 percent tariff plus penalty on Indian imports, raising concerns over trade dynamics. However, economists believe the GDP impact for India will remain contained, estimated between 0.1 to 0.3 percentage points. Despite the near-term disruptions, India is expected to continue benefiting from global supply chain shifts. Technically, the Nifty continues to struggle near resistance. Anand James, Chief Market Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, noted that the index once again failed to decisively cross the 24,960 level. He maintains a cautiously optimistic stance, stating that sustained trade above 24,675 could trigger another upswing, while a breakdown below the 24,650–24,600 zone could lead to a fall toward 24,450. A breakout above 25,000 could potentially push the index towards 25,330, he added."

This comes after the US President Donald Trump announced 25 percent tariff and an additional penalty on India, rattling the export-oriented stocks. Bangladesh has secured a trade deal with US, agreeing on 20 percent export tariff. This is significantly lower than the 37 percent initially proposed by the US President. This further fuelled the downturn in the stocks, as Indian textile exports will now face higher tariffs on exports than their rivals from Bangladesh. Gokaldas Exports shares dropped more than 4 percent to trade at Rs 814 in the afternoon. The stock has now declined nearly 9 percent over the two days. Notably, nearly 70 percent of the company’s topline comes from the US market. Indo Count Industries, which has a similar exposure to US market, saw its shares price decline more than 4 percent. The stock has dropped around 8 percent so far. Welspun Living and Vardhman Textiles shares also declined 4 percent each, while Pearl Global Industries shares plunged more than 6 percent. Trident shares declined more than 3 percent, while KPR Mill shares dropped up to 6 percent each. Among the smallcap stocks, Credo shares declined 20 percent to hit the lower circuit.

That may happen,"" says V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments Limited.""An important trend in the market is the weakness in the broader market, particularly the smallcaps. This trend is likely to continue given the high valuations of the segment. Sustained selling by the FIIs continues to be a negative. The sharp surge in the dollar index to 100 will nudge the FIIs to continue selling, putting pressure on large caps too. Investors can adopt a wait-and-watch strategy,"" he added.

Nifty Metal declined 0.93 percent, while Auto, Infra, Realty, and Midcap 100 indices also saw notable declines. Nifty FMCG and Media were the only gainers, rising 0.86 percent and 1.03 percent, respectively. Other sectors, including Bank, Private Bank, Consumer Durables, and Smallcap 100, edged lower. India VIX rose 1.65 percent to 11.73, indicating slightly higher market volatility. Among movers, shares of PNB Housing Finance fell sharply by over 15 percent on August 1, a day after the lender informed that the resignation of MD and CEO Girish Kousgi has been accepted by the board, a move that some brokerage notes have cited as negative, given his role in transforming PNB Housing, scaling new businesses and improving asset quality. Hindustan Unilever (HUL) jumped nearly 8 percent on August 1, taking the stock's gains in two days to 12 percent. This comes after brokerages issued positive notes for the stock after the release of the firm's April-June quarter results. The FMCG major reported a 6 percent year-on-year rise in consolidated net profit to Rs 2,768 crore for the quarter ended June 2025, aided by lower tax expenses and volume-led sales growth across key categories. Revenue grew 5 percent to Rs 16,323 crore. Shares of Swiggy fell as much as 4 percent after its net loss widened almost 96 percent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs 1,197 crore in the first quarter (Q1) of financial year 2025-26 (FY26), up from Rs 611 crore in the same period a year ago. The gains follow two foreign brokerages issuing bullish calls on the stock, citing positive growth levels. Jefferies has upgraded the counter to a buy, while Morgan Stanley maintained its overweight rating. Technical View ""Nifty opened weak but staged a strong recovery to touch 24,950, only to face resistance near the 50-EMA and end around 24,750 amid profit booking. Sentiment remains cautious, with crucial support at 24,500—holding above it is key to maintaining the current trend. A breakout above 25,000 is needed to turn the bias positive. Sensex was volatile, facing resistance near its 50-EMA at 81,800 but holding above the 100-EMA at 80,800. A decisive move above 82,050 is needed for further upside, while 80,500 remains a critical support. For the day, Nifty support is seen at 24,600 and resistance at 25,000,"" Vaishali Parekh, Vice President of Technical Research at PL Capital, says. Trent, Asian Paints, HUL, Eicher Motors, and ITC were the top gainers on the Nifty. Laggards on the index included Dr Reddy's, Sun Pharma, Cipla, Tata Steel, and ONGC.

The company has raised Q1 exploratory core drilling to 34.9km (16.2% y/y). The pace of core drilling is directly proportionate to R&R added, which would provide a road-map to a volume ramp-up.

"HUL shares jump 12% in 2 days as brokerages hike target prices after Q1 results: Should you buy, sell or hold?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/hul-shares-jump-12-in-2-days-as-brokerages-hike-target-prices-after-q1-results-should-you-buy-sell-or-hold-13365839.html,"The shares of Hindustan Unilever (HUL) jumped nearly 8 percent on August 1, taking the stock's gains in two days to 12 percent. This comes after brokerages issued positive notes for the stock after the release of the firm's April-June quarter results. Hindustan Unilever (HUL) on July 31 reported a 6 percent year-on-year rise in consolidated net profit to Rs 2,768 crore for the quarter ended June 2025, aided by lower tax expenses and volume-led sales growth across key categories. Revenue (total sales) grew 5 percent to Rs 16,323 crore, with underlying volume growth (UVG) at 4 percent and underlying sales growth (USG) at 5 percent, HUL said in a stock exchange filing. Profit after tax before exceptional items declined 5 percent year-on-year to Rs 2,526 crore, while earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) for the quarter stood at Rs 3,718 crore, marginally down from Rs 3,744 crore in the year-ago period. The EBITDA margin declined 130 basis points to 22.8 percent, in line with the company’s guidance, as HUL continued to step up business investments. Should you buy, sell or hold? Goldman Sachs upgraded HUL shares to 'Buy' from its earlier 'Neutral' rating, and raised its target price to Rs 2,900 per share, from its earlier estimate of Rs 2,400 per share. The latest target price implies an upside potential of nearly 15 percent from the stock's previous closing price. According to Goldman Sachs, HUL is witnessing a turnaround which is fuelled by a combination of macro factors and internal initiatives, according to the note cited by CNBC-TV18. The international firm is hopeful that HUL's revenue growth will speed up to high-single-digit levels by the second half of the ongoing financial year 2026 and in financial year 2027. JM Financial retained its 'Buy' rating on the stock, but increased its target price to Rs 2,770 apiece. The domestic brokerage said that the firm’s Q1 earnings were in line with its estimates. ""We like HUL's strategy pivot to focus on growth at the cost of near-term margin. Mgmt. commentary on outlook remains optimistic – volume recovery to continue, GM also expected to improve sequentially as pricing/NMI gap reduces. Consol. margin guidance remains unchanged at 22-23% (delivered closer to upper end in 1Q). With macro narrative improving along with clear step up in portfolio interventions by HUL, the worst seems to be behind. Initial benefits are visible with uptick in sales for Market Makers/Future Core portfolio & further gradual recovery in Core (GAL/Lifebuoy) should also follow,"" it added. Motilal Oswal Financial Services kept a 'Buy' call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 3,000 apiece. This implies an upside potential of nearly 19 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. ""The company plans to focus aggressively on volume acceleration, alongside new launches and the reactivation of its value proposition, which is expected to drive better growth in FY26,"" the domestic brokerage said. HUL shares hit a day’s high of Rs 2,727 in early morning trade. The stock later pared some gains to trade 2 percent higher at Rs 2,578 apiece.

Pharma stocks slump as Trump shoots letters to 17 global drug majors seeking lower prices,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/pharma-stocks-slump-as-trump-shoots-letters-to-17-global-drug-major-seeking-lower-prices-13365619.html,"Shares of leading pharma companies are sharply lower, as investors tried to assess the impact of US President Trump's letter to 17 of the global drug majors demanding them lower drug prices in US and bring it in-line with what other nations are paying for new medicines. The Nifty Pharma index fell over 2.8 percent to extend the fall for a third day, with Sun Pharma leading the fall with a 4 percent cut, followed by Aurobindo Pharma, Gland Pharma, Cipla, Granules India and Lupin down over 3 percent. As much as 20 percent of Sun Pharma's revenue comes from drugs sold in the US market. Shares of Sun Pharma were the worst hit on Nifty 50 following the quarterly earnings. Brokerage Investec has downgraded Sun Pharma by two notches to 'Sell', which had added to the sour sentiment. Trump's letters to 17 of the world’s biggest pharmaceutical majors has stated that companies should immediately lower charges for existing drugs, and furnish guarantee that future medicines be launched at par with what other countries are paying. The letters were sent to Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer and others, demanding that Most Favored Nation (MFN) pricing be implemented with in 60 days. During a briefing, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said, ""According to recent data, the prices that Americans have been paying for brand name drugs are more than three times the price of other similarly developed nations pay. The president is determined to solve this problem and took further action today. He has signed 17 letters to pharmaceutical companies' CEOs."" In the letter, Trump has issued a 60-day ultimatum to companies to voluntarily comply to the new pricing diktat, failing which US will deploy 'every tool in our arsenal' in order to protect Americans from 'continued abusive drug pricing' practices. Companies will also have to offer certain medicines directly to patients at prices at whch they are offered to third-party insurers, Trump's letter said. There is also an overhang of a pharma tariff policy coming soon, that US President had mentioned in the recent past. On July 29, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said during an interview with CNBC International that President Trump will be coming out with a pharmaceutical policy in the next two weeks, exploring higher tariffs on pharma companies. ""Basically, if you are not building your plant in America where we pay for pharmaceuticals, you are going to pay a massive tariff, because why should we pay for your drugs? And you make them overseas and you make your money overseas? At least if we’re going to pay for your drugs, you’re going to build them in America,"" Lutnick had said. Through the measure, Trump is seeking US drug makers to use the increased revenue from abroad for the benefit of American patients and tax payers by providing them direct access of medicines at MFN pricing. Sandeep Bhatia, Managing Director and Head of Equity India at Macquarie Capital told CNBC-TV18 that there is a potential fear of pricing pressure for the US supplies. ""...right now there's a fear that this most favoured nation (MFN) treatment for Medicaid and other US administered medical programmes, the pricing of that should match the pricing which the companies charge in other wealthy developed nations. So clearly there's a potentially a pricing pressure that can emerge for the US supplies."" CNBC International reported that spokespersons for Pfizer, Novo Nordisk and Novartis have said that they are working to find solutions to help Americans access affordable drugs."

Eicher Motors shares rise 4% after Q1; Morgan Stanley sees 25% downside,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/eicher-motors-shares-rise-4-after-q1-morgan-stanley-sees-25-downside-13365454.html,"Shares of Eicher Motors rallied as much as 4 percent to Rs 5,670 in morning trade on August 1 after the company reported a 9 percent rise in consolidated net profit at Rs 1,205 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2025. Eicher witnessed a 15 percent increase in revenue at Rs 5,042 crore in Q1 FY26. The gains come despite Morgan Stanley maintaining its Underweight rating with a target price of Rs 4,079. This implies a downside potential of 25 percent from the last close on the NSE. The management continues to focus on driving volumes over margins. However, the brokerage sees downside risks to consensus margin estimates, adding that the stock appears to be pricing in both high growth and high margins. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates While earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) grew 3 percent at Rs 1,203 crore in Q1 FY26 from Rs 1,165 crore in the same quarter of the previous fiscal, the operating margin declined by 266 basis points to 23.86 percent in the June quarter from 26.52 percent in the year-ago period. Speaking during the Q1 FY26 post-earnings call, the company’s management said it remains ""cautiously optimistic"" about overseas markets and is laying the groundwork for sustained expansion. Brazil, in particular, has emerged as a high-potential market for Royal Enfield, with its large two-wheeler customer base and improving macroeconomic environment. ""We see huge potential in Brazil. It’s a good two-wheeler market, and we’re putting the CKD (completely knocked down) infrastructure in place with two assembly partners already onboard,” the company said. Eicher is also working on localised financing options in the region to improve customer access. ""We’re tying up with banks to ensure seamless financing, and our retail footprint is expanding steadily."" Beyond Brazil, Eicher reported mixed trends across international markets. The UK remains muted due to an overhang of pre-registered inventory, but mainland Europe is seeing improving momentum. “We’ve taken distribution into our own hands in Europe and are now fixing the operational back end, including floor funding,” the management said. Eicher Motors shares have risen 16 percent since the beginning of the year.

Swiggy’s revenue from operations rose 54 percent YoY to Rs 4,961 crore in Q1, up from Rs 3,222 crore a year ago. It had reported a revenue of Rs 4,410 crore in the previous quarter. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates The drop comes despite two foreign brokerages issuing bullish calls on the stock, citing positive growth levels. Jefferies has upgraded Swiggy to a Buy with a target price of Rs 500 per share. The brokerage highlighted strong growth in the food delivery business during Q1 and noted continued momentum in quick commerce (Q-commerce). However, EBITDA margin declined quarter-on-quarter, primarily due to higher rider and staff costs. Despite this, management views Q1 as the trough for profitability, indicating improvement ahead. Morgan Stanley has maintained an ""Overweight"" rating on Swiggy, with a target price of Rs 450 per share. The brokerage said the food delivery segment is performing in line with expectations. It has also raised its profitability assumptions for the Q-commerce business and lowered loss projections based on positive commentary from the company on Q2 performance. Also read: India Inc Q1 earnings disappoint: Slowest profit growth in 8 quarters, revenue falls sharply Revenue for Swiggy's quick commerce business, Instamart, more than doubled to Rs 806 crore on an annual basis. GOV growth accelerated to 107.6 percent YoY and 21.1 percent QoQ to Rs 5,655 crore, with 1.2 million MTUs added. “Q1 is a seasonal low for availability of delivery partners given reverse-migration and beginning of rains, and hence incremental investments into their availability are made every year by Food delivery platforms. Bunched with our regular annual appraisal cycle in Q1, this has kept our Adjusted EBITDA margin at 2.4 percent (vs 2.9 percent in Q4); a seasonal impact which will normalise as the year progresses,” Swiggy Group CEO and MD Sriharsha Majety, talking about the company’s food delivery business. At about 9:30 am, shares of the company were trading at Rs 387, lower by 4.1 percent from the last close on the NSE.

"Maruti Suzuki shares rise over 1% after Q1; should you buy, sell or hold?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/maruti-suzuki-shares-rise-over-1-after-q1-should-you-buy-sell-or-hold-13364896.html,"Shares of Maruti Suzuki rose by over a percent to Rs 12,779 morning trade on August 1 after the company reported a 2 percent rise in net profit at Rs 3,712 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2025. It reported a net profit of Rs 3,650 crore in the year-ago period. The carmaker's revenue rose 8 percent to Rs 38,414 crore in Q1 FY26 as against Rs 35,531 crore a year ago. Non-operating income, or other income, for the quarter nearly doubled. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Jefferies has maintained a Buy rating on Maruti Suzuki, raising the target price to Rs 14,750 from Rs 13,600. While EBITDA fell 11 percent year-on-year, a significant improvement in average selling price (ASP) was offset by a decline in margins. The brokerage remains optimistic about demand but has trimmed its FY25–28 industry volume CAGR forecast from 8 percent to 6 percent. Jefferies flagged the continued decline in Maruti’s passenger vehicle (PV) market share as a concern. However, it noted that exports are growing steadily and a new ICE SUV is planned for launch in FY26. The firm expects a 12 percent CAGR in earnings per share over FY25–28. Reiterating a Buy rating on Maruti Suzuki, Motilal Oswal has set a target price of Rs 14,476, valuing the stock at 26x June FY27E EPS. The company is expected to benefit from multiple tailwinds in FY26, including the launch of the e-Vitara, a new SUV, and hybrid variants. Exports are projected to grow at least 20 percent, with around 70,000 units of the e-Vitara likely to be delivered, mostly to overseas markets. A favourable government policy on hybrids could act as a re-rating trigger, given MSIL’s strong positioning. While a 50 basis points margin pressure is expected in FY26 due to higher input costs, the company is projected to deliver a 10 percent earnings CAGR over FY25–27. Maruti Suzuki outpaced its peers in overseas sales during the June quarter, with exports rising 37.4 percent even as the rest of the industry saw a 2.1 percent decline. The carmaker now accounts for nearly half—47 percent—of India’s total passenger vehicle exports. Also read: Maruti Suzuki races ahead in export growth even as rivals lose ground Japan emerged as Maruti’s second-largest export market in Q1, ahead of several traditional markets. The company said it expects further growth once it begins shipping electric vehicles globally, including to Europe and Japan. After a sluggish start to the fiscal year, Maruti Suzuki is betting on a stronger second half, supported by new launches and a revival in rural demand. The company remains cautiously optimistic about industry growth and its ability to outperform peers despite muted volumes in the first quarter. Speaking during the post-earnings call, Maruti Suzuki’s management acknowledged that Q1 fell short of expectations, echoing broader concerns across the auto industry. “Q1 has not been up to the mark, but there are positives building up in Q2,” the company said, pointing to a better monsoon and steady rural sentiment. At about 9:20 am, shares of the company were trading at Rs 12,715, higher by 0.8 percent from the last close on the NSE. Maruti Suzuki shares have risen over 16 percent since the beginning of the year.

In a surprise move, Donald Trump has raised import duties on Canadian goods to 35 percent from 25 percent, keeping global investors on edge. HUL was the brightest spark, rising 4 percent and extending gains after strong Q1 earnings. At about 9:20 am, the Sensex was down 156.08 points or 0.19 percent at 81,029.50, and the Nifty was down 48.30 points or 0.20 percent at 24,720.05.

Nifty Metal was the biggest laggard, down 1.02 percent, followed by Nifty IT, which slipped 0.77 percent. Nifty PSU Bank and Oil & Gas fell 0.53 percent and 0.44 percent, respectively. The Auto, Bank, Consumer Durables, Private Bank, Midcap 100, and Smallcap 100 indices also edged lower. In contrast, Nifty FMCG was the standout gainer, rising 1.36 percent, while Nifty Media added 0.40 percent. Indices like Energy, Infra, Realty, and Pharma remained flat. Meanwhile, India VIX rose nearly 2 percent to 11.77, indicating a slight uptick in market volatility. Among individual stocks, Maruti Suzuki rose over a percent after the company reported 2 percent rise in net profit at Rs 3,712 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2025. The carmaker's revenue rose 8 percent to Rs 38,414 crore in Q1 FY26 as against Rs 35,531 crore a year ago. Jefferies has maintained a Buy rating on Maruti Suzuki, raising the target price to Rs 14,750 from Rs 13,600. Shares of Swiggy fell as much as 3 percent even as it reported that its net loss widened almost 96 percent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs 1,197 crore in the first quarter (Q1) of financial year 2025-26 (FY26), up from Rs 611 crore in the same period a year ago. The gains follow two foreign brokerages issuing bullish calls on the stock, citing positive growth levels. Jefferies has upgraded the counter to a buy while Morgan Stanley maintained its overweight rating. Two-wheeler major Eicher Motors rose over 2 percent after it reported a 9 percent rise in consolidated net profit at Rs 1,205 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2025. Eicher witnessed a 15 percent increase in revenue at Rs 5,042 crore in Q1 FY26. Morgan Stanley has maintained its Underweight rating. The brokerage sees downside risks to consensus margin estimates, adding that the stock appears to be pricing in both high growth and high margins. Technical View The support zone at 24,500–24,550 remains critical in the near term, while a convincing breakout above 24,900 could unlock further upside potential. For now, the Nifty continues to trade below the heavy resistance zone of 25,000, which also serves as a psychological barrier. Until this is reclaimed decisively, the overall sentiment remains cautious. Any short-term rally may attract renewed short positions unless backed by strong volumes and follow-through. Additionally, the long-short ratio, hovering around 14 percent, indicates an oversold territory, raising the possibility of a short-covering bounce — but only if the index breaks and sustains above the resistance zone. Hindustan Unilever, Tata Consumer Products, Hero MotoCorp, Asian Paints, and Maruti Suzuki were the top gainers on the Nifty. Laggards on the index included Dr Reddy's, ONGC, Cipla, Tata Steel, and JSW Steel.

"Sensex, Nifty to open lower as tariff uncertainty jolts investor mood; key levels to track on August 1",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sensex-nifty-to-open-lower-as-tariff-uncertainty-jolts-investor-mood-key-levels-to-track-on-august-1-13364852.html,"Benchmark indices Nifty and Sensex are set to open lower, starting the new month on a cautious note as fresh tariff actions by the US weigh on sentiment. In a surprise move, Donald Trump has raised import duties on Canadian goods to 35 percent from 25 percent, keeping global investors on edge. Dalal Street saw a choppy session in trade as investors weighed the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump imposing a 25 percent tariff and penalty on India. After opening with one percent losses, benchmark indices Nifty 50 and Sensex clawed back gains to trade in the green. However, the last hour of selling pressure drove the headline indices back into the red. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Here are the key levels to watch out for in today's session The index has clearly defined its key trading zone and appears stuck in a consolidation phase with limited momentum on either side. Although buyers have shown interest at lower levels, strong supply persists near resistance zones, making a directional bias elusive. The support zone at 24,500–24,550 remains critical in the near term, while a convincing breakout above 24,900 could unlock further upside potential. For now, the Nifty continues to trade below the heavy resistance zone of 25,000, which also serves as a psychological barrier. Until this is reclaimed decisively, the overall sentiment remains cautious. Any short-term rally may attract renewed short positions unless backed by strong volumes and follow-through. Additionally, the long-short ratio, hovering around 14%, indicates an oversold territory, raising the possibility of a short-covering bounce — but only if the index breaks and sustains above the resistance zone. ""The index has clearly defined its boundaries and remains confined within a consolidation zone, reflecting a lack of strong directional bias. While there are visible signs of accumulation at lower levels, sellers have consistently emerged from resistance zones, preventing any breakout attempts from gaining traction,"" Dhupesh Dhameja of SAMCO Securities said. ""The 55,500–55,700 band continues to serve as a critical support zone, while a breakout beyond 56,500 remains necessary to trigger sustained bullish momentum. For now, the Nifty Bank remains lodged beneath a heavy supply zone near the 56,500 mark — also coinciding with multiple key moving averages. Until the index decisively conquers this level, the broader trend remains cautious,"" he added. India VIX rose 3.01 percent, closing at 11.54. Despite significant negative cues, volatility stayed below the psychological 13 mark, suggesting that there is no panic or broad-based liquidation in the market. The subdued volatility implies that traders are expecting a continuation of the consolidation phase rather than a major breakdown. The Put-Call Ratio (PCR) has ticked up from 0.78 to 0.90, suggesting some bargain hunting at lower levels, although the upside remains constrained due to sustained overhead supply.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Bayer Cropscience, Jindal Stainless, General Insurance Corp, HUL, Bharti Hexacom, JSW Steel and others on August 1?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-bayer-cropscience-jindal-stainless-general-insurance-corp-hul-bharti-hexacom-jsw-steel-and-others-on-august-1-13363432.html,"The benchmark indices closed nearly 0.4 percent lower on July 31 following a Trump tariff-led volatile session. Bears dominated market breadth as about 1,786 shares declined, compared to 872 that gained on the NSE. The bearish sentiment is expected to prevail until the frontline indices provide a sustainable close above the medium-term moving average. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Jay Mehta, Technical Research at JM Financial Services Bayer Cropscience | CMP: Rs 6,322.5 Bayer Cropscience is currently forming a pennant pattern and is supported by the 20-day EMA following a breakout above the trendline resistance. The price action is displaying multiple Spinning Top and Doji candlestick patterns, indicating market indecision. A breakout above Rs 6,512 could target levels of Rs 7,200 and Rs 7,600, with a stop-loss at Rs 6,130 post-breakout. Additionally, a golden crossover at the start of the month supports a bullish outlook. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 7,200, Rs 7,600 Stop-Loss: Rs 6,130 Ajanta Pharma | CMP: Rs 2,751.4 Ajanta Pharma has broken out above a descending triangle pattern, supported by strong volume activity. A golden crossover was observed on Wednesday, reinforcing the bullish outlook. The price is currently finding support near its 20-EMA. A breakout above the resistance zone of Rs 2,850–2,862 could trigger a bullish move, potentially pushing the price toward Rs 3,000 and Rs 3,100. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,000, Rs 3,100 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,580 Mandar Bhojane, Senior Equity Research Analyst at Choice Broking Jindal Stainless | CMP: Rs 694.1 Jindal Stainless is displaying a strong bullish setup, with technical indicators aligning across multiple timeframes. On the daily chart, the stock is nearing a breakout from a descending triangle pattern, which typically signals accumulation and reduced selling pressure. A decisive close above Rs 700 with strong volumes would validate the breakout and could lead to a sharp upward rally. The stock is trading comfortably above its 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-day EMAs, indicating sustained strength across short-, medium-, and long-term horizons. The RSI is at 58.21, steadily rising and showing strong buying interest without being overbought. Momentum remains favourable, with a positive MACD bias, further supporting the bullish structure. Traders may consider a buy-on-dips strategy near Rs 675. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 777 Stop-Loss: Rs 655 NLC India | CMP: Rs 242.25 NLC India is consolidating near a key breakout zone, reflecting underlying strength. On the daily chart, the stock is forming a symmetrical triangle pattern, a classic bullish continuation setup. Rising volumes during this consolidation phase indicate growing investor interest, increasing the probability of an upside breakout. A decisive close above Rs 245 would confirm the breakout and could ignite strong bullish momentum. The RSI is at 57.85 and trending upward, signaling healthy momentum. On the downside, Rs 235 acts as immediate support and can be considered a buy-on-dips zone for positional traders. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 267 Stop-Loss: Rs 230 General Insurance Corporation of India | CMP: Rs 392.15 General Insurance Corporation of India is on the verge of a breakout from a falling trendline and a descending triangle pattern on the daily chart. This technical setup, along with rising volumes, reflects renewed buying interest and a potential trend reversal in favour of the bulls. From a momentum perspective, the RSI stands at 57.76, trending upward and showing bullish divergence, further supporting the strengthening momentum. On the downside, Rs 382 serves as a strong support level, making it a key accumulation zone for traders. If the stock sustains above current levels with continued volume participation, it could move toward a short-term target of Rs 440. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 440 Stop-Loss: Rs 369 Om Mehra, Technical Research Analyst at Samco Securities Hindustan Unilever | CMP: Rs 2,512.20 Hindustan Unilever decisively broke out of a downward-sloping flag pattern on the daily chart. This bullish continuation pattern emerged after a sharp recovery from the Rs 2,400 level. Thursday’s breakout was backed by a notable rise in volume, confirming strong follow-through momentum. The stock reclaimed the Rs 2,510 horizontal resistance, which had capped gains in a previous breakout attempt. The candle structure shows a wide bullish body with a close near the day’s high, indicating strong institutional buying and no signs of upper wick exhaustion. The daily RSI rebounded sharply from the 50 level and is now near 64, climbing above its signal line and hinting at improving bullish momentum. The surge in volume adds further credibility to the breakout. The flag breakout, along with a rebound in the FMCG sector, suggests potential short-term upside. The Rs 2,470–2,480 zone can be considered for accumulation on any pullback. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,640 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,460 JSW Steel | CMP: Rs 1,048.3 JSW Steel is breaking out above a rising triangle formation on the daily chart after facing multiple rejections near the Rs 1,045 zone. The stock has consistently formed higher lows since March, with the trendline now acting as a critical support—underlining the bullish setup. The breakout candle is accompanied by a noticeable increase in volume and has closed near the day’s high, indicating sustained strength. The RSI has risen sharply to 65, crossing above its signal line and confirming strengthening momentum. Meanwhile, the MACD is nearing a bullish crossover. The stock has formed a solid base in the Rs 1,030–1,035 range, and with the current breakout above Rs 1,045, the bullish trend is likely to extend further. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,095 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,025 Bharti Hexacom | CMP: Rs 1,847.70 Bharti Hexacom has regained strength, staging a breakout after forming a double bottom base near the Rs 1,750 zone. The pattern had been developing over the past few weeks within a defined rectangle range, and Thursday’s move confirms a bullish reversal from recent consolidation. The stock reclaimed the 20-EMA and crossed above the upper horizontal resistance near Rs 1,840, which had capped multiple intraday rallies. The breakout candle closed near the day’s high with above-average volume, indicating renewed strength. The RSI has rebounded to 56, validating the breakout with improving momentum. The price is also trending above the 50-SMA, which is expected to act as immediate support on any dip. The daily Supertrend indicator also supports the bullish bias. Any pullback toward the Rs 1,820 zone would present a good accumulation opportunity.

"Eicher Motors cautiously optimistic on exports as Brazil, Europe show promise",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/eicher-motors-cautiously-optimistic-on-exports-as-brazil-europe-show-promise-13362164.html,"Eicher Motors is doubling down on key international markets such as Brazil, even as it works to strengthen its global distribution and financing ecosystem to support the next leg of growth for Royal Enfield. Speaking during the Q1 FY26 post-earnings call, the company’s management said it remains ""cautiously optimistic"" about overseas markets and is laying the groundwork for sustained expansion. Brazil, in particular, has emerged as a high-potential market for Royal Enfield, with its large two-wheeler customer base and improving macroeconomic environment. Also read: Dividend on hold as Indus Towers conserves cash amid evolving industry landscape, eyes inorganic bets ""We see huge potential in Brazil. It’s a good two-wheeler market, and we’re putting the CKD (completely knocked down) infrastructure in place with two assembly partners already onboard,” the company said. Eicher is also working on localised financing options in the region to improve customer access. ""We’re tying up with banks to ensure seamless financing, and our retail footprint is expanding steadily."" Beyond Brazil, Eicher reported mixed trends across international markets. The UK remains muted due to an overhang of pre-registered inventory, but mainland Europe is seeing improving momentum. “We’ve taken distribution into our own hands in Europe and are now fixing the operational back end, including floor funding,” the management said. Australia continues to perform well, while Indonesia has also shown encouraging growth. However, the company acknowledged ongoing challenges in Thailand. In South Asia, Royal Enfield is seeing strong traction in Bangladesh and Nepal, with both CKD facilities operating at full capacity.

Profit after tax stood at Rs 445 crore, down from Rs 538 crore in Q1FY25. The company’s EBITDA rose 25.8% to Rs 850 crore, with margins improving slightly to 23.8%. Revenue from operations surged to Rs 3,570 crore, driven by strong growth in both domestic and export businesses. Domestic sales rose 18.9% to Rs 3,101 crore, while exports jumped 81.1% to Rs 469 crore, aided by the consolidation of BSV and expansion in the base business. “We continue to outperform the Indian pharma market across chronic and acute segments,” said Rajeev Juneja, Vice Chairman and Managing Director. “Our consumer healthcare and specialty portfolios are gaining traction, and we remain confident of delivering healthy performance this year onwards.” Consumer Healthcare (CH) revenue grew 15% YoY to Rs 237 crore, with strong secondary sales in brands like Gas-O-Fast, Manforce, and Preganews.

Maruti Suzuki races ahead in export growth even as rivals lose ground,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/maruti-suzuki-races-ahead-in-export-growth-even-as-rivals-lose-ground-13361459.html,"Maruti Suzuki outpaced its peers in overseas sales during the June quarter, with exports rising 37.4 percent even as the rest of the industry saw a 2.1 percent decline. The carmaker now accounts for nearly half—47 percent—of India’s total passenger vehicle exports. The company attributed its strong performance to long-term investments in building a global network and adapting its domestic sales and service strategies to overseas markets. “This has been a gradual build-up over the past decade,” the management said during its post-earnings call, pointing to improved dealership penetration, a wider product portfolio, and better customer engagement practices abroad. Read more: Dividend on hold as Indus Towers conserves cash amid evolving industry landscape, eyes inorganic bets A key enabler, the company said, has been access to Suzuki’s global distributor network, which helped expand Maruti’s footprint across nearly 100 countries.

The company said it expects further growth once it begins shipping electric vehicles globally, including to Europe and Japan.

One of the brokerage notes cited the development as negative, given his role in the transformation of PNB Housing Finance and scaling new businesses and improving asset quality. During his tenure, Kousgi drove innovation and strategic evolution, and aligned the company with customer-centric solutions. The board appreciated Kousgi's leadership and mentorship through his tenure and wished him best for his future endeavours. The MD and CEO submitted his resignation on July 30, which was accepted by the board on July 31. Kousgi will also step down from the boards of PHFL Home Loans and PEHEL Foundation, both subsidiaries of PNB Housing Finance. Brokerages also noted that only recently, the head of PNB Housing's newly-launched affordable housing business head too had resigned. Shares of PNB Housing Finance marginally ended lower on July 31, however, in the last one month, the HFC's shares are down over 11 percent. During the earnings call after the June quarter results, Kousgi had said that PNB Housing Finance is confident to achieve a higher NIM guidance of 3.7% as against the previously stated range of 3.6–3.65%, with affordable and emerging segments driving the margins."
"Maruti Suzuki pins festive hopes on new launches, rural recovery amid tepid start to FY26",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/maruti-suzuki-pins-festive-hopes-on-new-launches-rural-recovery-amid-tepid-start-to-fy26-13361008.html,"After a sluggish start to the fiscal year, Maruti Suzuki is betting on a stronger second half, supported by new launches and a revival in rural demand. The company remains cautiously optimistic about industry growth and its ability to outperform peers despite muted volumes in the first quarter. Speaking during the post-earnings call, Maruti Suzuki’s management acknowledged that Q1 fell short of expectations, echoing broader concerns across the auto industry. “Q1 has not been up to the mark, but there are positives building up in Q2,” the company said, pointing to a better monsoon and steady rural sentiment. Also read: Fiscal deficit for June quarter at 17.9% of full-year target, a quarter of annual capex spent The festive season, which spans the second and third quarters, is expected to be a key demand trigger. “We are looking at Q2 and the festive season with optimism,” the management noted, adding that the company is hopeful of a stronger showing compared to the performance so far this year. Maruti Suzuki has lined up two new SUV launches for the current financial year—one of them electric—which the company believes will bolster its market position. These launches are expected to play a pivotal role in meeting the company’s guidance of outpacing industry growth, pegged at around 2 to 3 percent. SIAM, the industry body, had initially projected growth of 1 to 2 percent for FY26, but a weak Q1 has cast some doubt on that outlook. Still, Maruti’s management is confident that upcoming product activity and a better festive season could help the sector regain momentum. During the quarter, Maruti Suzuki reported a 2 percent rise in net profit at Rs 3,712 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2025.

For the month of July, Sensex and Nifty lost nearly 3 percent each. The BSE Mid and Smallcap indices shed 0.7 percent each, underperforming the main indices. US President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced 25% tariffs on India and an additional penalty for buying Russian military equipment and oil ahead of the August 1 deadline.

Among Sectors, FMCG Index outperformed, rallied 1.4 percent whereas Oil and Gas, Capital market and Pharma indices shed over 1 percent. Technically, after a gap down open one more time market took the support near 24600/80600 and bounced back sharply. From the day lowest point market rallied over 300 points. However, it failed to close above 24900/81600 levels. Nevertheless, on intraday charts it has formed higher bottom formation which is largely positive. For the day traders now, 24650/80800 and 24600/80600 would act as a key support zones. As long as market is trading above the same, the pullback formation is likely to continue. On the higher side market could move up to 25000/81900 and 25050/82200. On the other side, below 24600/80600 the sentiment could change. Below the same, traders may prefer to exit out from the trading long positions. Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets witnessed volatile swings on the monthly expiry day and ended marginally lower amid mixed cues. The surprise tariff announcement by the US President on India initially triggered a knee-jerk reaction; however, a gradual recovery in heavyweight stocks across sectors helped the index briefly turn positive. Selling pressure resurfaced in the final hours, once again putting bulls on the back foot. As a result, the Nifty closed at 24,768.35, down 0.35%. All major sectors, except FMCG, came under pressure, with pharma, metal, and energy emerging as the top losers. The broader indices also resumed their corrective phase, each losing over a percent. As the new series begins, the market is likely to consolidate, but global developments and corporate earnings will continue to drive volatility. We maintain our cautious stance and recommend a stock-specific approach, given the mixed trends across sectors. Traders should also avoid averaging down on loss-making positions. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The index recovered smartly after a gap-down opening, rising above 24,900. However, the Nifty failed to sustain at higher levels. The index continues to trade below the 50 EMA, confirming a bearish trend. The RSI is in a bearish crossover. Despite several negative setups, a hidden positive divergence has been observed over the past 2–3 days, indicating a potential bullish reversal. This setup may play out well if the Nifty decisively moves above 25,000. On the lower side, support is placed at 24,600. A range-bound movement is expected until the Nifty breaks out of the 24,600–25,000 range.

However, margins remained resilient, with EBITDA margin expanding ~200bp to 15.2% on the back of robust cost controls. Management remains cautious on near-term revenue recovery but expects profitability to improve through the streamlining of backend process and operational efficiencies. We cut our FY26-28 revenue estimates by ~5% each, though EBITDA margin assumptions are raised by 60-80bp, driven by cost controls, resulting in broadly unchanged EBITDA estimates over FY26-28E. Outlook The recent ~10% run-up in RLXF’s stock price over the past month appears to fully price in the near-term margin optimization. At ~56x 1-year forward P/E, valuations remain rich for modest growth. We maintain Sell rating with a revised TP of INR410, based on 40x Sep’27E P/E.

Order inflow was healthy for the quarter, driven by the second HVDC order win of Bhadla-Fatehpur and a bulk order from Powergrid for the supply of transformers. Hitachi Energy has been a key beneficiary of renewable and T&D capex in both domestic and international markets. The company’s capacity expansion will help meet the upcoming demand across segments.

"Hospital chains to add 14,500 beds, spend up to Rs 32,000 crore by FY27, says ICRA",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/hospital-chains-to-add-14-500-beds-spend-up-to-rs-32-000-crore-by-fy27-says-icra-13357402.html,"India’s hospital industry is set for major growth, with at least 13 players expected to invest up to Rs 32,000 crore by FY27 to add around 14,500 beds, ICRA said. Occupancy rates are projected to remain resilient at 62–64 percent this fiscal, while average revenue per occupied bed (ARPOB) is expected to grow 6–8 percent in line with the 7 percent year-on-year increase seen in FY25. Operating profit margins (OPM) are forecast to stay stable at 22–24 percent. “Following a strong occupancy of 63.5 percent in FY25, the sector is expected to maintain momentum, driven by expanding insurance penetration and continued market share gains for organised players,” said Mythri Macherla, vice president & sector head, ICRA. “Structural factors such as rising lifestyle diseases, higher awareness and affordability, and preventive health check-ups will continue to fuel demand.” Despite geopolitical headwinds impacting international patient inflows, especially from Bangladesh, ARPOB remained solid in FY25, supported by improved case and payor mix, annual price revisions and high-value procedures like robotic surgeries, it said. Capex surge The planned bed additions represent a 26 percent increase over current capacity and are aimed at addressing unmet demand in underserved regions such as Nagpur, Lucknow, Ongole and Coimbatore. Citing these aggressive expansion plans and The robust operating metrics, ICRA revised its outlook for the sector to “positive”. The sector is also seeing increased consolidation through mergers and acquisitions, helping hospital chains diversify geographically and expand specialty offerings, it said. Institutional investor interest has surged, buoyed by strong financial performance and growth prospects. Despite the capital-intensive nature of the industry, ICRA expects debt metrics to remain healthy. It expects operating profit before depreciation, interest, taxes, and amortization (OPBDITA) at 2.4–2.6x by March 2026, up from 2.1x in FY25. Return on capital employed (RoCE), long constrained by high gestation periods, is expected to remain between 13 percent and 15 percent in FY26, supported by improved performance of mature hospitals and turnaround of newer centres."
"Nifty Bank jumps 1.4% from day's low as markets shrug off Trump tariff jitters; ICICI, Kotak Mahindra Bank lead recovery",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/nifty-bank-jumps-1-4-from-day-s-low-as-markets-shrug-off-trump-tariff-jitters-icici-kotak-mahindra-lead-recovery-13357223.html,"The Nifty Bank index sharply rebounded from day’s low, amid a broad-based recovery in the stock market. This comes as the impact of Trump tariffs gradually faded away from the market. After US President Donald Trump announced 25 percent tariff and a penalty on India, Indian benchmark indices opened in the red with significant losses. However, Sensex and Nifty sharply recovered all losses later. Nifty Bank, which had declined more than 600 points in the morning to hit a low of 55,547, regained more than 750 points (1.4 percent) from that level to swing into the green territory. It is currently up nearly 150 points (0.27 percent) to stand at 56,300. The recovery was led by private banks, with Kotak Mahindra Bank and ICICI Bank leading gains, rising nearly 1 percent each. Axis Bank and Bank of Baroda shares gained more than 0.5 percent each. IDFC First Bank, HDFC Bank, AU Small Finance Bank and State Bank of India were hovering in the green with marginal gains. Punjab National Bank (PNB) shares dropped 2 percent, after weak Q1 results. Federal Bank, IndusInd Bank and Canara Bank shares were hovering in the red with marginal losses. On the technical front, the index has broken key resistance levels suggested by analysts. This may imply strong upside potential for the bank index. ""A sustained move above 56,275 could lead to a rally toward 57,000 and 57,630,"" said Hardik Matalia, Derivative Analyst - Research at Choice Equity Broking Private Limited. ""The broader price structure continues to reflect a bullish bias, making dips a buying opportunity for positional traders,"" he said. Motilal Oswal Wealth Management in its report stated that Bank Nifty's support is at 55,750, and then at 55,500. Resistance was quoted at 56,350, and then at 56,500. ""Now it has to hold above 56,000 zone for a bounce towards 56,350 then 56,500 levels while a hold below the same could see decline towards 55,750 then 55,500 zones,"" it said. US President Donald Trump on July 30 announced 25 percent tariffs and an additional penalty against India ahead of the August 1 deadline. In a post on Truth Social, Trump described India as America's ""friend"" but added that it will face 25 percent tariffs plus a penalty for buying Russian military equipment and oil. The US President reiterated that India has among the ""highest tariffs in the world"". ""Seasoned investors know markets rarely reprice on the headline alone. Beneath the volatility lies a set of divergent sectoral narratives that deserve attention,"" said Bhavik Joshi, Business Head at INVasset PMS.

While the sectoral indices were down more than 1 percent each, benchmark indices were down around 0.6 percent each. Sensex was down 460 points to hover around 81,022, while Nifty dropped 141 points to stand at 24,714. US President Donald Trump on July 30 announced 25 percent tariffs and an additional penalty against India ahead of the August 1 deadline. In a post on Truth Social, Trump described India as America's ""friend"" but added that it will face 25 percent tariffs plus a penalty for buying Russian military equipment and oil. The US President reiterated that India has among the ""highest tariffs in the world"". The US Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided to keep interest rates unchanged at 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent in the July 29-30 meeting. Nifty IT: The index dropped 1 percent to hover around 35,161 in the morning. The index has now snapped a two-day gaining streak. Coforge and Wipro shares were the top losers on the index, dropping nearly 2 percent each. Infosys, Mphasis and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) shares fell over 1 percent each, while Persistent Systems, Tech Mahindra and HCL Tech were down with marginal losses. The stocks in the sector have seen strong downturn recently, after heavyweight TCS announced significant layoffs, which in turn raised concerns over the broader industry. ""IT stocks remain under pressure, and justifiably so. The recent wave of layoffs and hiring freezes points to a demand environment that’s yet to normalize. While some anticipate a second-half recovery, the runway appears longer than previously expected. Budget cuts and delayed decision-making by global clients continue to weigh on sentiment. The space may need more time before a sustained uptrend materializes,"" said Bhavik Joshi Business Head, INVasset PMS. Nifty Metal Nifty Metal index dropped nearly 1 percent to hover around 9,331. The index has now extended losses for the second consecutive session. Hindustan Copper was the top loser on the index, falling more that 4 percent to trade at Rs 247 apiece. Adani Enterprises shares followed, dropped nearly 1.5 percent. The Adani Group company is set to release its results for the first quarter of the financial year 2026 today. NMDC, Jindal Steel and Power, Hindustan Zinc and Welspun Corp shares dropped more that 1 percent, while Vedanta, Hindalco, Tata Steel, Jindal Stainless Steel, SAIL and NALCO shares were trading in the red with marginal losses. ""Metals are bearing the brunt of tariff anxiety, but they’ve also corrected sharply in recent months. With global stimulus chatter rising and inventories low, this may be a setup for a reversion play once dust settles,"" Joshi said. Nifty Realty Nifty Realty dropped more than 1 percent to hover around 907. The index has now extended losses to the second consecutive session. Sobha shares were the top loser on the index, dropping more than 2 percent. Oberoi Realty, Phoenix Mills and Raymond shares followed, tumbling nearly 2 percent each. Prestige Estates and Anant Raj shares fell more than 1 percent each, while DLF and Brigade Enterprises shares were down in the red with marginal losses. Analyst Bhavik Joshi however holds an optimistic view for the sector. ""Real estate is quietly gaining strength. Institutional buying, robust pre-sales, and rising rental yields suggest that premium residential and commercial spaces are seeing genuine demand—not just speculative froth. This trend often leads the broader cycle,"" he said. Here's what analysts say: ""Given the current landscape of heightened volatility and mixed technical signals, traders are advised to adopt a cautious ""sell-on-rise"" strategy, particularly when operating with leverage. Booking partial profits on rallies and employing tight trailing stop-losses is essential to manage risk. Fresh long positions should only be initiated if the Nifty sustains above the 25,000 mark. While the broader market undertone remains cautiously bullish, it is crucial to monitor key technical levels and global developments closely,"" said Hardik Matalia, Derivative Analyst - Research at Choice Equity Broking Private Limited. However, recent progress in trade negotiations suggests a constructive path forward, and the trade deal between India and US will eventually follow provided both nations show the necessary political will, said Utsav Verma, Head of Research - Institutional Equities, Choice Broking. ""Many investors expect the tariff rate to eventually settle around 15%, paving the way for renewed confidence and stronger trade ties. In the short term, market will try to shed off its complacency. We do not expect huge knee-jerk reaction but a rangebound market focused on ongoing earnings,"" he said.

The surge in share price has taken HEG to nearly a year high, and up over 11 percent on a YTD basis. HEG posted a strong Q1FY26 net profit of Rs 71.8 crore from Rs 2.6 crore a year ago, with revenue up at Rs 613 crore from Rs 570 crore, along with a three-fold margin growth at 17.29%, which the management said is likely to go higher later in the fiscal. The company said its existing capacity utilization rate stands at 85-90%. The board also approved a 15,000 TPA graphite electrode capacity expansion, at a cost of around Rs 650 crore, which will be funded via internal accruals and debt if required, and is likely to be completed in 30 months. The capacity expansion by HEG can also be seen in the light of the US recently seeking to nudge its EV manufacturing to rely less on Chinese components. The US duty on Chinese graphite is expected to put pressure on the global supply chain, with China also squeezing export of critical minerals used by EV manufacturers. Earlier this month, the US announced plans to impose 93.5 percent of preliminary anti-dumping duties on graphite imports from China, accusing it of dominating the processing capacity and unfairly subsidizing its industry. Graphite is an important raw material used in the anodes of batteries of electric vehicles, with about two-thirds of the US supply coming from China in 2024. China is the dominant player in graphite processing, making it the most-exposed to potential supply risks and in urgent need for diversification, International Energy Agency had said in a report in May 2025."

"Sensex down 500 pts, Nifty below 24,750 as Trump imposes 25% tariff; India VIX spikes 7%",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sensex-down-500-pts-nifty-below-24-750-as-trump-imposes-25-tariff-india-vix-spikes-7-13355552.html,"Benchmark indices Nifty and Sensex tumbled sharply on July 31 as investor sentiment took a hit following U.S. President Donald Trump’s unexpected move to slap a 25 percent tariff—along with additional penalties—on Indian exports. While markets had braced for a possible tariff, the severity of the action caught traders off guard, triggering a wave of selling across sectors. At about 9:20 am, the Sensex was down 468.95 points or 0.58 percent at 81,012.91, and the Nifty was down 140.85 points or 0.57 percent at 24,714.20. About 651 shares advanced, 2013 shares declined, and 108 shares were unchanged. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates ""The 25 percent tariff rate is certainly a negative development as it compares to a lower rate for peers such as Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines, which compete with India in a similar category of labour-intensive products and electronic goods,"" says Garima Kapoor, Economist and Executive Vice President, Elara Capital. ""The exact details of the tariffs on the exempted items, such as pharma and the ones that were charged at a differential rate such as iron, steel and auto is unknown as of now, but inclusion of pharma into tariffs should be incremental negative for India’s exports as US accounts for more than 30 percent of India’s pharma exports. If no deal is signed by September-October, we see a downside to the full-year GDP growth estimate for India by 20 bps,"" she added. At the open on July 31, market sentiment appeared cautious with most sectoral indices trading in the red. The Nifty Auto index led the losses, falling 1.16 percent, followed by declines in Nifty Consumer Durables (1.15 percent), Oil & Gas (1.65 percent), and Midcap 100 (0.93 percent). Banking stocks were under pressure as well, with Nifty Bank and PSU Bank down 0.59 percent and 0.78 percent, respectively. The Nifty IT and Metal indices also saw mild declines. On the volatility front, India VIX spiked 7.76 percent to 12.08, indicating a pick-up in market nervousness. Shares of Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) fell over a percent despite the company posting a strong set of numbers for the June quarter and issuing an upbeat outlook for the months ahead. The automaker reported a 32 percent year-on-year rise in net profit to Rs 3,450 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, driven by healthy demand for its high-margin SUVs and tractors. Revenue from operations grew 26 percent to Rs 34,143 crore, up from Rs 27,133 crore in the same period last year. Jio Financial Services Ltd (JFSL) shares gained almost a percent despite the weak market mood after the company unveiled plans to raise as much as Rs 15,825 crore through a preferential issue of warrants. The company’s board has cleared the proposal to issue 50 crore warrants at Rs 316.50 apiece—each warrant carrying a face value of Rs 10 and a premium of Rs 306.50. Technical View Market sentiment remains cautiously optimistic amid heightened volatility and mixed global cues. ""On the technical front, the Nifty formed a bullish hammer candlestick and closed above the previous day’s high, signaling the potential for a follow-up rally. The index is currently trading above its 100-day EMA, reflecting underlying strength. A close above the 50-day EMA at 24,935 would further confirm a bullish reversal. If this level is sustained, the index could advance toward 25,200 and eventually 25,800 in the coming sessions. On the downside, support is placed in the 24,590–24,400 zone, which could act as a potential area for dip-buying,"" Hardik Matalia of Choice Equity Broking said. Jio Financial Services and Tata Steel were the only gainers on the Nifty. Laggards on the index included Tata Motors, Dr Reddy's, Reliance Industries, Titan Company, and Bharti Airtel.

Shares of Tata Motors are off early lows, still down over 0.5 percent on July 31 as of 10:00am, following a sharp fall a day before, weighed down by investors' concern around the acquisition. Iveco's trucks have 11 percent market share in EU and Latin America, while its the second largest bus manufacturer in Europe. In powertrain and engines, Iveco is the fifth largest maker in the world. The company which is rooted in Europe has core revenues and production coming in from across the world, which will be a significant expansion of Tata Motors' footprint in the CV business. While Europe accounts for 75 percent of the industrial revenue for Iveco, the company has a manufacturing as well as R&D presence in South America, with 12 percent revenue contribution. Iveco's trucks are a market leader in the LCV category, and the company has a growing traction in HCVs, with new launches in the electric platform. This multi-energy portfolio covering all segments is being positioned by Tata Motors are a big draw. The development comes as Tata Motors is progressing towards a demerger to separate commercial and passenger vehicle businesses by March 2026. ""This is a logical next step following the demerger of the Tata Motors Commercial Vehicle business and will allow the combined group to compete on a truly global basis with two strategic home markets in India and Europe. The combined group's complementary businesses and greater reach will enhance our ability to invest boldly. I look forward to securing the necessary approvals and concluding the transaction in the coming months,"" N Chandrasekaran, Chairman of Tata Motors said.

Olof Persson, CEO of Iveco Group said, ""By joining forces with Tata Motors, we are unlocking new potential to further enhance our industrial capabilities, accelerate innovation in zero-emission transport, and expand our reach in key global markets."" Tata Motors will also gain access to advanced electric and hydrogen powertrains, likely accelerating its clean mobility transition. Iveco is a leader in a vast range of advanced powertrain technologies in agriculture, construction, and commercial vehicles sectors. Girish Wagh, Executive Director of Tata Motors called the deal a 'strategic leap forward' in the ambition to build a 'future-ready commercial vehicle ecosystem'. The deal will see a continuation of the Iveco brand, with Tata Motors maintaining the corporate identity, as well as key brands and logos, positioning Tata Motors as a global CV powerhouse that can be comparable to Daimler Truck and Volvo. Iveco has been a strong 4 in European heavy truck sales with a 13% share, trailing Daimler (Mercedes), Volvo, and Scania. Renault Trucks, Volvo's subsidiary, reported 2024 revenue of €6.42 billion, Daimler Truck's 2024 group revenue was around €54.1 billion, while Iveco reported consolidated revenue of €15.29 billion last year. Together, Iveco and Tata Motors' commercial vehicle business will have combined revenue of €22 billion (Rs 2.20 lakh crore) across Europe (50%), India (35%) and the Americas (15%). The combined entity now boasts of a broader range of trucks, buses, and commercial vehicles, enhancing competitiveness, as well as new efficiencies in manufacturing, R&D, and supply chains. Italy's Iveco Group is breaking itself up to selling the defense unit to Leonardo, and the rest of the business to Tata Motors. The offer aims to acquire 100% of Iveco's shares with a subsequent delisting from Euronext Milan. This is the first major deal by Tata Motors nearly two decades after its purchase of Jaguar Land Rover in 2008."
"Trump imposes 25% tariff on India: Markets unlikely to see any long-term earth-shattering impact, says Shankar Sharma",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trump-imposes-25-tariff-on-india-markets-unlikely-to-see-any-long-term-earth-shattering-impact-says-shankar-sharma-13353852.html,"The imposition of 25% tariff on India by the US will not have a major long-term impact on India and the Indian markets in particular as Indian exports to US are traditional in nature, including gems & jewellery, leather, textiles etc, says Shankar Sharma. From a market perspective, it is a non-issue but could act as a catalyst at a time when the sentiments are already subdued due to the ongoing lacklustre earnings season. “India exports nothing of great value to the US. It is all traditional exports like gems & jewellery, textile etc, which we have been doing for many years. I don’t think the 25 percent tariff will have a major long-term impact of any kind,” Sharma told Moneycontrol. Also Read: Industry 'disappointed' as US Imposes 25% tariff on Indian goods On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump announced a 25 percent tariff on Indian imports and an additional penalty effective from August 1. More importantly, the Indian tariff rate of 25 percent is higher than most other countries with which the US has reached an agreement -- European Union (15 percent), UK (10 percent), Indonesia (19 percent), Philippines (20 percent) and Vietnam (20 percent). The Indian tariff rate, however, is less than the current 30 percent rate for China. Meanwhile, Sharma is of the view that the US tariff development is a “non-issue” for the Indian markets, which are currently in the doldrums because of domestic factors. “The Indian market in any case is not in a good position and it has nothing to do with US tariffs. It is more to do with the corporate earnings and other local factors. Indian market has not done well in the recent past and is among the worst performers globally when compared with other leading equity markets,” said Sharma. Also Read: 'We're negotiating right now': Trump refers to BRICS, ‘tremendous’ trade deficit with India after announcing 25% tariff Indeed, as since mid-December, Indian benchmarks Sensex and Nifty are the worst performing benchmarks among all leading global indices. Since December 17, 2024, the Sensex and Nifty have each declined by nearly four percent, ranking them as the worst-performing among major global indices during this period. Only the Philippines Stock Exchange comes close with a decline of three percent. In sharp contrast, South Korea’s Kospi surged by 35 percent, followed by Germany’s DAX and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng with gains of 30 percent and 26 percent, respectively. Other notable performers included France’s CAC, Brazil’s Ibovespa, and the UK’s FTSE 100, each posting an increase of approximately 17 percent. “There could be some impact on the rupee. In the markets, the tariff news will have some impact on the sentiments but not a long-term earth-shattering one,” said Sharma.

Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 4,600 Stop-Loss: Rs 4,180 TD Power Systems | CMP: Rs 516.2 TD Power Systems has recently demonstrated a strong technical setup by finding support in the Rs 460–450 zone—a region marked by the confluence of the 100-day EMA and the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level, drawn from its prior upward rally spanning Rs 387 to Rs 552.75. This confluence zone acted as a critical support level, and the stock responded with a sharp rebound over the last two trading sessions. The recovery was accompanied by a noticeable increase in trading volumes, which adds conviction to the strength and reliability of the reversal. Importantly, the stock has now moved decisively above its short-term moving averages. Further, the daily RSI has also surged past the 60 mark, entering bullish territory and indicating improving strength in the underlying trend.

Consolidated volumes declined by ~3% YoY (India volumes down 7.1% YoY while international volumes up 15%). Despite temporary headwinds in the domestic market, VBL reported an EBITDA margin expansion of ~80bp YoY, led by operating efficiencies and healthy growth in the international markets (led by volume growth, positive currency movement in Africa territories; and increased operational efficiencies).

The growth was driven by the supply chain business, which grew ~23% YoY in 1QFY26. The manufacturing sector’s revival, particularly in chemicals, engineering, and consumer goods, has positively impacted demand for reliable, scalable, and sustainable logistics solutions.

Lower CDMO and complex hospital generics (CHG) sales led to a considerable operating deleverage. This resulted in a 48% miss on EBITDA. However, the reduction in interest costs and lower tax rates capped the loss at INR1b for the quarter. Management, however, has kept its FY26 guidance intact, implying 1QFY26 to be an aberration.

EBITDA/PAT, adj. for UoP provisions (INR1.4b), stood at 6%/20% above our estimates. Total volumes came in 6% above our estimate, primarily due to higher third-party and service cargos. Dahej utilization was 8% above estimates, while Kochi utilization stood 18% below est. We note that Spot LNG prices remain elevated at USD13/mmbtu in Jul’25’td (INR12.4/mmbtu in 1QFY26).

"M&M sticks to SUV growth outlook, expects PLI boost to power EV margins",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/m-m-sticks-to-suv-growth-outlook-expects-pli-boost-to-power-ev-margins-13352762.html,"Mahindra & Mahindra has reiterated its SUV growth guidance of mid to high teens for FY26, despite sector-wide concerns over demand sustainability and supply-side disruptions. The management, speaking on an analyst call post its Q1FY26 results, said that the company is well-positioned to meet its targets, backed by a steady stream of launches and tactical product refreshes. To be sure, M&M's Q1FY26 SUV revenue market share increased to 27.3 percent from 23.5 percent in the previous quarter, the company's investor presentation showed. Also read: Donald Trump announces 25% tariffs on India, slaps penalty over purchase of Russian equipment & energy ""We stay with our number"" the management said when asked about risks to SUV growth. ""We believe we can achieve this because we have two new electric SUVs and two more expected in calendar 2026. Minor variant refreshes, like the Rev-X2 on the XUV 3XO and updates to Scorpio N, have also helped."" The company added that further model actions are planned over the next few months, supported by a strong launch pipeline that could spill into early 2026 and support FY26 growth. However, the management flagged that any material deterioration in the macroeconomic environment could pose a risk, though current conditions support their guidance. On electric vehicles, Mahindra clarified that the improved profitability visible in the latest results does not include any benefits from the government’s Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme. The company said it has qualified for the PLI under the XEV90 programme but is awaiting the final technical audit. ""We expect the certification in Q2 or early Q3. Once received, we will accrue PLI benefits from near the launch period,"" the company said.

While Mahindra’s EV segment is still in early stages, the company pointed to improved operating leverage and strategic cost management as key contributors to profitability. Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd on July 30 reported a 32 percent jump in net profit at Rs 3,450 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, driven by robust demand for its high-margin sports utility vehicles and tractors. The carmaker's revenue from operations rose 26 percent to Rs 34,143 crore in Q1FY26 from Rs 27,133 crore in Q1FY25. M&M surpassed estimates as a Moneycontrol poll of six brokerage firms had pegged the automaker’s revenue at Rs 33,471 crore and net profit at Rs 3,112 crore. Anish Shah, Group CEO & Managing Director, M&M Ltd, said, “The operating excellence in our Auto and Farm businesses is evident in continued market share gains and margin expansion.” M&M shares closed at Rs 3,209, higher by 0.3 percent from the last close on the NSE.

Speaking after the company’s Q1FY26 results, the management said it has taken multiple steps to mitigate risk and does not anticipate any production disruption in the near term. ""We are comfortably covered on the rare earth magnet issue, as we have shared earlier. There has been no disruption to production because of that,"" the company told analysts. ""We’ve taken a series of actions — some related to inventory, others around substituting rare earth with light earth elements and ferrite materials."" Also read: Donald Trump announces 25% tariffs on India, slaps penalty over purchase of Russian equipment & energy The management added that Mahindra is covered for the current quarter and the next two, and “mostly covered” for the fourth quarter as well.

"Abbott India reboots Digene: old-school antacid, new school vibe",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/abbott-india-reboots-digene-old-school-antacid-new-school-vibe-13351239.html,"Heartburn may be timeless but the way India treats it is changing. Abbott India is giving its iconic antacid brand, Digene, a contemporary twist, introducing new formats for the modern, on-the-go consumer. Leading the makeover is Digene Insta On The Go, a single-dose, water-free stick pack that offers quick, discreet relief, a shift from the traditional tablet and syrup formats. “Digene Insta On The Go is a ready-to-use solution that fits seamlessly into the fast-paced lives of today’s consumers,” said Dr Jejoe Karankumar, Director of Medical Affairs at Abbott. “It was developed based on consumer insights that revealed a growing demand for portable solutions to manage acidity.” These launches are part of the company’s broader lifecycle management strategy, aimed at diversifying the Digene portfolio through new formats and flavours. “For over 80 years, Digene has been synonymous with acidity relief in India. Today, it’s a household name,” Karankumar said. Introduced by Boots in India as a prescription gel, Digene transitioned to an over-the-counter (OTC) product. The move was enabled by regulatory approvals and a shift in medical practice, as physicians increasingly prescribed newer proton pump inhibitors. Abbott repositioned Digene for direct consumer engagement, rolling out mass-market campaigns and expanding retail visibility. “We believe great brands are built on real insights and meaningful stories,” said Karankumar. “Our consumer-centric approach has been pivotal in developing Digene in various formats, tailored to meet different customer needs and preferences.” Campaigns like #ControlKar helped the brand maintain visibility in a competitive landscape dominated by rivals such as Eno, Gelusil, and Pudin Hara. In FY25, Digene posted sales of Rs 248.6 crore, at a 10 percent compound annual growth rate over four years. It remains one of Abbott India’s top-performing brands within its gastrointestinal portfolio, which grew 15.9 percent last year. India’s Rs 1,700 crore antacid category is growing at a CAGR of 8 percent. “To keep Digene meaningful and relevant, we took a deep dive into what the brand truly stands for—its purpose, values, and personality,” Karankumar added. “By listening closely to what people need and feel, we’ve built a strong connection with our audience—one that continues to grow with every story we share.”"

Click to View More Outlook for July 31 Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets traded in a tight range and ended marginally higher amid mixed cues. After a flat start, the Nifty oscillated within a narrow band throughout the session and finally settled at 24,855.05. Sentiment remained subdued due to lingering uncertainty over the trade deal, following the latest statement from the US President about potential tariffs on India, amid delays in finalizing the agreement ahead of the August 1 deadline. Additionally, caution prevailed ahead of the outcome of the FOMC meeting — while no rate change is expected, the Fed's commentary will be closely watched. On the sectoral front, a mixed trend kept traders active. IT and FMCG ended marginally in the green, while realty and auto declined. The broader market also saw mixed action — the midcap index closed flat, whereas the smallcap index slipped nearly half a percent. Participants will react to the US Fed Chair’s commentary in early Thursday trades. On the index front, the 25,000–25,100 zone is expected to act as a resistance and may attract fresh selling if the market attempts a rebound, while support is seen around the 24,450–24,550 zone. Given the likelihood of volatile swings, we recommend maintaining a cautious stance and prefer a hedged approach. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The Nifty traded within a narrow range, remaining below the 50 EMA on the daily timeframe. The short-term trend remains slightly weak as the index continues to sustain below this critical moving average. However, the possibility of a meaningful recovery stays intact, supported by a bullish reversal pattern formation and a hidden positive divergence. In simple terms, the index may continue to move up towards 25,000–25,200 in the short term, with support placed at 24,750. A break below this level could weaken market sentiment.

"Broken altimeter, ignored warnings: Hearings reveal what went wrong in DC crash that killed 67",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/broken-altimeter-ignored-warnings-hearings-reveal-what-went-wrong-in-dc-crash-that-killed-67-2025-08-02/,"Over three days of sometimes contentious hearings this week, the National Transportation Safety Board interrogated Federal Aviation Administration and Army officials about a list of things that went wrong and contributed to a Black Hawk helicopter and a passenger jet colliding over Washington, D.C., killing 67 people. The biggest revelations: The helicopter's altimeter gauge was broken, and controllers warned the FAA years earlier about the dangers that helicopters presented. At one point NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy scolded the FAA for not addressing safety concerns. “Are you kidding me? Sixty-seven people are dead! How do you explain that? Our bureaucratic process?” she said. “Fix it. Do better.” Victims of the January crash included a group of elite young figure skaters, their parents and coaches and four union steamfitters from the Washington area. Here is a look at the major takeaways from the hearings about the collision, which alarmed travelers before a string of other crashes and close calls this year added to their worries about flying: The helicopter was flying at 278 feet (85 meters) — well above the 200-foot (61-meter) ceiling on that route — when it collided with the airliner. But investigators said the pilots might not have realized that because the barometric altimeter they were relying on was reading 80 to 100 feet (24 to 30 meters) lower than the altitude registered by the flight data recorder. The NTSB subsequently found similar discrepancies in the altimeters of three other helicopters from the same unit. An expert with Sikorsky, which makes the Black Hawks, said the one that crashed was an older model that lacked the air data computers that make for more accurate altitude readings in newer versions. Army Chief Warrant Officer Kylene Lewis told the board that an 80- to 100-foot (24- to 30-meter) discrepancy between the different altimeters on a helicopter would not be alarming, because at lower altitudes she would be relying more on the radar altimeter than the barometric altimeter. Plus Army pilots strive to stay within 100 feet (30 meters) of target altitude on flights, so they could still do that even with their altimeters that far off. But Rick Dressler of medevac operator Metro Aviation told the NTSB that imprecision would not fly with his helicopters. When a helicopter route like the one the Black Hawk was flying that night includes an altitude limit, Dressler said, his pilots consider that a hard ceiling. Both tried to deflect responsibility for the crash, but the testimony highlighted plenty of things that might have been done differently. The NTSB’s final report will be done next year, but there likely will not be one single cause identified for the crash. “I think it was a week of reckoning for the FAA and the U.S. Army in this accident,” aviation safety consultant and former crash investigator Jeff Guzzetti said. Army officials said the greater concern is that the FAA approved routes around Ronald Reagan International Airport with separation distances as small as 75 feet (23 meters) between helicopters and planes when planes are landing on a certain runway at Reagan. “The fact that we have less than 500-foot separation is a concern for me,” said Scott Rosengren, chief engineer in the office that manages the Army’s utility helicopters. Army Chief Warrant Officer David Van Vechten said he was surprised the air traffic controller let the helicopter proceed while the airliner was circling to land at Reagan’s secondary runway, which is used when traffic for the main runway stacks up and accounts for about 5% of flights. Van Vechten said he was never allowed to fly under a landing plane as the Black Hawk did, but only a handful of the hundreds of times he flew that route involved planes landing on that runway. Other pilots in the unit told crash investigators it was routine to be directed to fly under landing planes, and they believed that was safe if they stuck to the approved route. Frank McIntosh, the head of the FAA’s air traffic control organization, said he thinks controllers at Reagan “were really dependent upon the use of visual separation” to keep traffic moving through the busy airspace. The NTSB said controllers repeatedly said they would just “make it work.” They sometimes used “squeeze plays” to land planes with minimal separation. On the night of the crash, a controller twice asked the helicopter pilots whether they had the jet in sight, and the pilots said they did and asked for visual separation approval so they could use their own eyes to maintain distance. Testimony at the hearing raised serious questions about how well the crew could spot the plane while wearing night vision goggles and whether the pilots were even looking in the right spot. The controller acknowledged in an interview that the plane’s pilots were never warned when the helicopter was on a collision path, but controllers did not think telling the plane would have made a difference at that point. The plane was descending to land and tried to pull up at the last second after getting a warning in the cockpit, but it was too late. An FAA working group tried to get a warning added to helicopter charts back in 2022 urging pilots to use caution whenever the secondary runway was in use, but the agency refused. The working group said “helicopter operations are occurring in a proximity that has triggered safety events. These events have been trending in the wrong direction and increasing year over year.” Separately, a different group at the airport discussed moving the helicopter route, but those discussions did not go anywhere. And a manager at a regional radar facility in the area urged the FAA in writing to reduce the number of planes taking off and landing at Reagan because of safety concerns. The NTSB has also said the FAA failed to recognize a troubling history of 85 near misses around Reagan in the three years before the collision, NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said “every sign was there that there was a safety risk and the tower was telling you that.” But after the accident, the FAA transferred managers out of the airport instead of acknowledging that they had been warned. “What you did is you transferred people out instead of taking ownership over the fact that everybody in FAA in the tower was saying there was a problem,” Homendy said. “But you guys are pointing out, ‘Welp, our bureaucratic process. Somebody should have brought it up at some other symposium.’” ___ Associated Press writer Leah Askarinam contributed."
India indicates it will keep buying Russian oil despite Trump's threats,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/india-indicates-it-will-keep-buying-russian-oil-despite-trumps-threats-2025-08-02/,"NEW DELHI (AP) — India has indicated that it would continue buying oil from Russia despite threats by U.S. President Donald Trump. The Indian foreign ministry said its relationship with Russia was “steady and time-tested,” and should not be seen through the prism of a third country. Addressing a weekly presser on Friday, spokesman Randhir Jaiswal said India’s broader stance on securing its energy needs was guided by the availability of oil in the markets and prevailing global circumstances. The comments follow an announcement by President Donald Trump that he intends to impose a 25% tariff on goods from India plus an additional import tax because of New Delhi’s purchases of Russian oil. The threat came as the U.S. president has increasingly soured on Russia for failing to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine and has threatened new economic sanctions if progress is not made. India bought 68,000 barrels per day of crude oil from Russia in January 2022, but by June of same year oil imports rose to 1.12 million barrels per day. The daily imports peaked at 2.15 million in May 2023 and have varied since. Supplies rose as high as nearly 40% of India's imports at one point, making Moscow the largest supplier of crude to New Delhi, the Press Trust of India reported, citing data from Kpler, a data analytics company. India’s daily oil consumption is pegged around 5.5 million barrels, of which nearly 88% is met through imports. The country has historically bought most of its crude from the Middle East, but this has changed since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. India, the world’s third-largest crude importer after China and the U.S., began buying Russian oil available at discounted rates after the West shunned it to punish Moscow."
What to know if you're at risk of having your wages garnished over student loan debt,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/what-to-know-if-youre-at-risk-of-having-your-wages-garnished-over-student-loan-debt-2025-08-02/,"NEW YORK (AP) — Millions of student borrowers could begin having their wages garnished as soon as this summer, according to estimates from credit bureau TransUnion. The company predicts that by August roughly 3 million borrowers could move into default, meaning they're 270 days past due on payments. At that point, loan holders are at risk of having 15% of their pay docked by the government, with the money going toward the outstanding debt. There has been no clear indication of when wage garnishment will start. After the pandemic-era pause on student loan payments ended in May, borrowers have had to reassess the state of their loans and budgets. According to TransUnion, another 2 million borrowers are on course to default in September. A Biden-administration grace period, during which late or missed payments were not counted against credit scores, ended in the fall. Since then, millions of borrowers have seen hits to their credit ratings. Here's what to know: “The most important thing borrowers can do before administrative wage garnishment restarts is to log into studentaid.gov to check whether their federal student loans are in default and take steps now to remove them from default,” said Kyra Taylor, staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center. Taylor said it's not uncommon for borrowers to be unaware that their loans are in default. If borrowers attended college or graduate school during different periods of time, or if they have different federal loan types, they may also have multiple student loan servicers. If that's the case, you should act now to get your loans out of default and back into good standing by either entering a rehabilitation agreement, where you must make nine consecutive payments based on their income, or by consolidating your loans into a new federal Direct Loan. “Because this hasn’t happened for so long, there are many people who have no idea they’re at risk,"" said Aissa Canchola Bañez, policy director at the Student Borrower Protection Center. Wait times for student borrowers attempting to contact their loan servicers have been long, with many dropped calls, in part due to layoffs at the Education Department. Bañez recommends contacting your congressperson, using a casework tool that can guide you through submitting a constituent request. “These offices have entire teams dedicated to constituent casework for when you have an issue with a federal agency, such as the Department of Education,” she said. “So you can request assistance from your member of congress — your representative or senator.” Until past due payments are paid or the loan's default status is resolved, borrowers are at risk of having up to 15% of their wages deducted directly from their paychecks. The Department of Education has sent notices to borrowers warning that tax refunds and wages could be withheld starting this summer if borrowers don’t take steps to restart payments. The department hasn’t yet provided additional information on timing. Richelle Brooks, 37, an education administrator based in Los Angeles, said she's received warnings and notices about the resumption of collection of her loans. For several degrees, she still has $239,000 in outstanding debt, and she was informed her monthly payments on those loans will be roughly $3,000. “I can't afford it,” she said. “We just came out of the moratorium — not paying for five years. People getting these notices — they're terrified. I'm uneasy, too."" Brooks said she's an informed borrower who stays up to date on each development and who knows her options. She plans to enroll in coding classes, at least half-time, which could place her loans in deferment, so she wouldn't be required to make monthly payments, while she makes a financial plan. There's still time to take action. According to Taylor, the Department of Education must provide 30 days notice before it sends a garnishment order to your employer. During that time, you can request a hearing to object by telling the department that the garnishment would cause you financial hardship. You can also request that the department reduce the amount being garnished and submit documentation about your income and expenses. To do this, you must make your hearing request in writing, postmarked no later than 30 days after the garnishment order. Your loan holder will then arrange the hearing. If you're unsure who your loan holder is, you can contact the Education Department's Default Resolution Group. If you were laid off from your last job, you can also object to garnishment if you have not been in your current job for 12 consecutive months. You can further request a hearing and object if you submitted an application for certain kinds of statutory discharges and those have not yet been decided. Some common reasons for statutory discharge of student loans include: if the school you attended closed before you could complete your degree, if your school owes you a refund but fails to pay it, if you're experiencing total disability, or if you're experiencing bankruptcy. “If the borrower requests a hearing within 30 days after receiving the garnishment notice, the department cannot start garnishment until it issues a decision on the borrower’s objections and financial hardship request,” Taylor said. You can request a hearing after the 30 day period is up, but in those cases the department will generally not stop garnishing your wages while the hearing request is pending. ___ The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

"From Laos to Brazil, Trump's tariffs leave a lot of losers. But even the winners will pay a price",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/from-laos-to-brazil-trumps-tariffs-leave-a-lot-of-losers-but-even-the-winners-will-pay-a-price-2025-08-02/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s tariff onslaught this week left a lot of losers – from small, poor countries like Laos and Algeria to wealthy U.S. trading partners like Canada and Switzerland. They’re now facing especially hefty taxes – tariffs – on the products they export to the United States starting Aug. 7. The closest thing to winners may be the countries that caved to Trump's demands — and avoided even more pain. But it's unclear whether anyone will be able to claim victory in the long run — even the United States, the intended beneficiary of Trump’s protectionist policies. “In many respects, everybody’s a loser here,’’ said Barry Appleton, co-director of the Center for International Law at the New York Law School. Barely six months after he returned to the White House, Trump has demolished the old global economic order. Gone is one built on agreed-upon rules. In its place is a system in which Trump himself sets the rules, using America’s enormous economic power to punish countries that won’t agree to one-sided trade deals and extracting huge concessions from the ones that do. “The biggest winner is Trump,” said Alan Wolff, a former U.S. trade official and deputy director-general at the World Trade Organization. “He bet that he could get other countries to the table on the basis of threats, and he succeeded – dramatically.’’ Everything goes back to what Trump calls “Liberation Day’’ – April 2 – when the president announced “reciprocal’’ taxes of up to 50% on imports from countries with which the United States ran trade deficits and 10% “baseline’’ taxes on almost everyone else. He invoked a 1977 law to declare the trade deficit a national emergency that justified his sweeping import taxes. That allowed him to bypass Congress, which traditionally has had authority over taxes, including tariffs — all of which is now being challenged in court. Trump retreated temporarily after his Liberation Day announcement triggered a rout in financial markets and suspended the reciprocal tariffs for 90 days to give countries a chance to negotiate. Eventually, some of them did, caving to Trump’s demands to pay what four months ago would have seemed unthinkably high tariffs for the privilege of continuing to sell into the vast American market. The United Kingdom agreed to 10% tariffs on its exports to the United States — up from 1.3% before Trump amped up his trade war with the world. The U.S. demanded concessions even though it had run a trade surplus, not a deficit, with the UK for 19 straight years. The European Union and Japan accepted U.S. tariffs of 15%. Those are much higher than the low single-digit rates they paid last year — but lower than the tariffs he was threatening (30% on the EU and 25% on Japan). Also cutting deals with Trump and agreeing to hefty tariffs were Pakistan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines. Even countries that saw their tariffs lowered from April without reaching a deal are still paying much higher tariffs than before Trump took office. Angola's tariff, for instance, dropped to 15% from 32% in April, but in 2022 it was less than 1.5%. And while Trump administration cut Taiwan's tariff to 20% from 32% in April, the pain will still be felt. “20% from the beginning has not been our goal, we hope that in further negotiations we will get a more beneficial and more reasonable tax rate,” Taiwan’s president Lai Ching-te told reporters in Taipei Friday. Trump also agreed to reduce the tariff on the tiny southern African kingdom of Lesotho to 15% from the 50% he’d announced in April, but the damage may already have been done there. Countries that didn't knuckle under — and those that found other ways to incur Trump's wrath — got hit harder. Even some poorer countries were not spared. Laos' annual economic output comes to $2,100 per person and Algeria's $5,600 — versus America's $75,000. Nonetheless, Laos got rocked with a 40% tariff and Algeria with a 30% levy. Trump slammed Brazil with a 50% import tax largely because he didn't like the way it was treating former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who is facing trial for trying to lose his electoral defeat in 2022. Never mind that the U.S. has exported more to Brazil than it's imported every year since 2007. Trump's decision to plaster a 35% tariff on longstanding U.S. ally Canada was partly designed to threaten Ottawa for saying it would recognize a Palestinian state. Trump is a staunch supporter of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Switzerland was clobbered with a 39% import tax — even higher than the 31% Trump originally announced on April 2. ""The Swiss probably wish that they had camped in Washington'' to make a deal, said Wolff, now senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. ""They’re clearly not at all happy.’’ Fortunes may change if Trump's tariffs are upended in court. Five American businesses and 12 states are suing the president, arguing that his Liberation Day tariffs exceeded his authority under the 1977 law. In May, the U.S. Court of International Trade, a specialized court in New York, agreed and blocked the tariffs, although the government was allowed to continue collecting them while its appeal wend its way through the legal system, and may likely end up at the U.S. Supreme Court. In a hearing Thursday, the judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit sounded skeptical about Trump's justifications for the tariffs. “If (the tariffs) get struck down, then maybe Brazil’s a winner and not a loser,’’ Appleton said. Trump portrays his tariffs as a tax on foreign countries. But they are actually paid by import companies in the U.S. who try to pass along the cost to their customers via higher prices. True, tariffs can hurt other countries by forcing their exporters to cut prices and sacrifice profits — or risk losing market share in the United States. But economists at Goldman Sachs estimate that overseas exporters have absorbed just one-fifth of the rising costs from tariffs, while Americans and U.S. businesses have picked up the most of the tab. Walmart, Procter & Gamble, Ford, Best Buy, Adidas, Nike, Mattel and Stanley Black & Decker, have all hiked prices due to U.S. tariffs ""This is a consumption tax, so it disproportionately affects those who have lower incomes,'' Appleton said. “Sneakers, knapsacks ... your appliances are going to go up. Your TV and electronics are going to go up. Your video game devices, consoles are going to up because none of those are made in America.’’ Trump’s trade war has pushed the average U.S. tariff from 2.5% at the start of 2025 to 18.3% now, the highest since 1934, according to the Budget Lab at Yale University. And that will impose a $2,400 cost on the average household, the lab estimates. “The U.S. consumer’s a big loser,″ Wolff said. ____ AP Economics Writer Christopher Rugaber contributed to this story."
Bitcoin and Dividends: A Winning Combo in These 3 ETFs,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/bitcoin-and-dividends-a-winning-combo-in-these-3-etfs/,"With Bitcoin trading just below all-time highs, there is fresh attention on the world's first and largest cryptocurrency. Investors concerned about the future of the dollar may also be inclined to turn to crypto, though the space remains highly speculative. If the risk of investing directly in Bitcoin or another major token is too high, an alternative is a cryptocurrency-focused exchange-traded fund (ETF). The most straightforward crypto funds are spot ETFs like the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund NYSEARCA: FBTC. These funds invest directly in Bitcoin and are thus highly risky, although they do provide a layer of protection for investors in that investors don't have to store and transfer crypto holdings by themselves. An income-generating Bitcoin fund may be a better alternative for less risk-tolerant investors. These funds typically use crypto futures, covered calls, and other complex strategies to generate distributions that function similarly to dividend payments made by traditional stocks. Of course, tax implications in these cases may be different, so it's up to the investor to keep track of the implications. One way to generate income for investors is with call options on Bitcoin futures ETFs, and that's exactly the play that the NEOS Bitcoin High Income ETF NYSEARCA: BTCI aims for. This fund invests in exchange-traded products (ETPs) directly exposed to Bitcoin. BTCI is actively managed, meaning that the team from NEOS makes decisions about how and when to utilize call options to maximize distributions while also achieving upside potential. BTCI is one of the newer ETFs in the Bitcoin and crypto space, having only launched late in 2024. However, its track record so far is highly successful; it has returned more than 26% in 2025 alone. This is in addition to monthly distributions, which have provided the fund with a dividend yield of 22.2%. Investors should expect to pay for this fund's active management. BTCI, unsurprisingly, has a fairly high expense ratio of 0.98%. Far cheaper crypto funds are available, but many investors may find the fund's track record and history of distributions to more than make up for the comparably high cost. For a bit more diversification outside of the Bitcoin space, investors might look to the Global X Blockchain & Bitcoin Strategy ETF NASDAQ: BITS. BITS does include a focus on the Bitcoin futures market, but it also aims for exposure to stocks of companies in the blockchain technology and digital assets industries as well as other ETFs focused on blockchain. BITS has traditionally offered investors a distribution twice per year, translating to an annual dividend yield of 24.5%. Considering the fund's substantial payouts and active strategy combining cryptocurrency with traditional stocks and ETFs, the fund's expense ratio of 0.65% is relatively low. Its year-to-date (YTD) return of roughly 18% is likely quite compelling. Investors should be aware, though, that BITS has quite low assets under management (AUM) at just $35.4 million and low trading volume, which may make liquidity a concern for more active traders. The first Bitcoin-related ETF to launch in the United States was the ProShares Bitcoin ETF NYSEARCA: BITO. However, BITO does not invest directly in Bitcoin; instead, it invests in futures and swaps. As might be expected for the first-ever Bitcoin fund, BITO has substantially higher AUM and trading volume than BITS above, with about $2.8 billion in invested assets. Distributions are also a popular draw for BITO investors, as the fund makes monthly payments and has a dividend yield of 49.6%. With an expense ratio of 0.95%, BITO remains on the higher end of the expense ratio scale for Bitcoin funds, but the fund's strong history, its distributions, and recent performance likely make that a worthwhile fee for many investors. BITO has returned about 21% so far this year, far ahead of the broader market. Before you consider NEOS Bitcoin High Income ETF, you'll want to hear this."
Profits drop at Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway as it writes down its Kraft Heinz investment,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/profits-drop-at-warren-buffetts-berkshire-hathaway-as-it-writes-down-its-kraft-heinz-investment-2025-08-02/,"OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Warren Buffett's company reported less than half as much profit in the second quarter as it took a $3.76 billion writedown on the value of its stake in Kraft Heinz, as that iconic food producer considers largely undoing the merger that Berkshire Hathaway helped bankroll. Berkshire said it earned $12.37 billion, or $8,601 per Class A share, during the quarter. That's down from $30.248 billion, or $21,122 per Class A share, a year ago, because it recorded a much smaller paper investment gain this year. Berkshire's earnings can swing wildly from quarter to quarter because it has to record the current value of its massive investment portfolio even though it doesn't sell most of the stocks. That's why Buffett has long recommended that investors pay more attention to Berkshire's operating earnings, which exclude those investment gains. Although last year Berkshire did surprise shareholders by selling off a huge chunk of its Apple stake which inflated the investment gains then. By that measure, Berkshire's operating earnings were only down slightly at $11.16 billion, or $7,759.58 per Class A share. That compares with $11.598 billion, or $8,072.16 per Class A share, a year ago. Most of Berkshire's myriad assortment of companies — major insurers like Geico, BNSF railroad, a group of utilities and a collection of manufacturing and retail businesses — generally performed well despite the uncertainty about the economy and President Donald Trump's tariffs. The four analysts surveyed by FactSet Research expected Berkshire to report earnings per Class A share of $7,508.10, so the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate's results were ahead of that. Berkshire owns more than 27% of Kraft Heinz' stock and, for years, it had representatives on the company's board. Buffett has said previously that he believes the company's iconic brands will do well over time, but in hindsight, he overpaid for the investment and underestimated the challenges branded foods face from retailers and the growth of private label products. This spring, Berkshire's representatives resigned from the Kraft Heinz board shortly before the company announced it is exploring strategic options that may include spinning off a large part of its portfolio of brands. Over the years since Berkshire helped Kraft buy Heinz in 2015, the company has been hurt by changing consumer tastes and a shift toward healthier options than Kraft’s core collection of processed foods. Another writedown could be coming in the future because CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert pointed out that Berkshire's holding of 28% of Occidental Petroleum's stock, which is currently valued at about $5.3 billion less than the $16.5 billion that Buffett paid for it. Buffett's is still sitting on a massive pile of $344.1 billion in cash, although the company's reserves dipped slightly from the $347.7 billion cash it was holding at the end of the first quarter. Buffett told shareholders in May he just isn't finding any attractive deals for companies he understands. Buffett surprised shareholders at the annual meeting when he announced that he plans to give up the CEO title at the end of the year and hand over operations to Vice Chairman Greg Abel, but Buffett will remain Chairman. Berkshire shareholders might be disappointed that the company didn't repurchase any of its shares this quarter, even though the price has fallen more than 12% since just before Buffett announced his retirement. But investor Chris Ballard, who is managing director at Check Capital, said he wasn't surprised at the lack of buybacks because even after the recent drop, Berkshire's stock is still selling at a premium compared to the value of its businesses. Many investors are watching Berkshire's BNSF closely after rival Union Pacific announced a plan to buy Norfolk Southern earlier this week to create the nation's first transcontinental railroad. The speculation is that BNSF needs to pursue a merger with eastern rail CSX to be able to compete. But Seifert said it isn't Buffett's style to jump into a deal just because the market thinks he should. Over the decades, he has built Berkshire by finding strong companies selling for less than they are worth. CSX is trading near its 52-week high at $35.01 amid all the deal speculation. “He wants to do it because he found an undervalued franchise -- not because the market says you need to do a deal,” Seifert said. “I think one of the reasons why that cash hasn’t been deployed is that valuations run through the Berkshire M-and-A model tend to be too rich. But if there’s a logical case to be made they’ll accept it.” And BNSF appears to be doing fine right now on its own. The railroad recorded a 19% jump in its operating profit this quarter at $1.47 billion as it cut costs and delivered about 1% more shipments. Berkshire's insurance results disappointed a bit as it appeared the company might be pulling back from writing as much property insurance at a time when premiums aren't as attractive. Even in areas where it is growing, like Geico, Seifert said Berkshire lagged behind peers such as Progressive and Allstate. Berkshire normally pulls back on writing insurance when it doesn't like the premiums. “The insurance business has struggled a bit. I would say the takeaways for me is on that front, they’re doing less property and casualty insurance,” said Ballard, who's firm counts Berkshire as its largest holding. Berkshire said it's underwriting operating profit dipped to just below $2 billion in the quarter from last year's $2.26 billion."
Is PG&E an AI Power Play? Why Options Traders Are Betting Big,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/is-pg-and-e-an-ai-power-play-why-options-traders-are-betting-big/,"Utility stocks are typically known for their predictability, not for explosive growth. It is especially noteworthy, then, when market indicators begin flashing for one of the utility sector’s most-watched companies. For Pacific Gas & Electric NYSE: PCG, a dramatic, recent spike in bullish activity suggests some professional investors believe the company is at a major inflection point. This unusual interest warrants a deeper look into the fundamental drivers that could be fueling a powerful turnaround, one that links the future of California's power grid to the global boom in artificial intelligence (AI). A clear signal of shifting sentiment appeared on July 25, when the trading volume of bullish call options for PG&E stock soared by over 380% compared to its daily average. A call option gives an investor the right to buy a stock at a specific price in the future, making it a direct bet on a price increase. A surge of this magnitude signals a wave of new confidence. A closer look at the trading data shows significant interest in options expiring in September 2025 with ""strike prices"" of $16, $19, and $20 per share. With PG&E’s stock price currently trading in the 13-14 range, this pattern reveals that investors are positioning for a sustained rally. They are betting on a potential upside of 20% to 50% over the coming months, which raises a critical question: What fundamentals justify such optimism? The justification for this bullish sentiment is found in the company's second-quarter 2025 earnings report. The results paint a picture of a business that is successfully stabilizing its operations and finances. The company confidently reaffirmed its full-year non-GAAP core earnings per share (EPS) guidance of $1.48 to $1.52. This signals that management's plan is on track, providing the predictability investors value. This stability is built on a foundation of tangible operational achievements that reduce risk. The company is also managing its regulatory environment more proactively. It recently submitted its smallest rate increase request in a decade. While legislative debates in Sacramento remain a key watch item, earnings call that the company's $63 billion, five-year financial plan can withstand various outcomes, CEO Patti Poppe stated on the call without diluting shareholder value by issuing new stock at current prices. While a stable foundation is essential, the catalyst igniting genuine investor excitement is a powerful, new growth engine. PG&E’s earnings report revealed that demand for its new data center pipeline has swelled to an immense 10 gigawatts. This surge is a direct result of the artificial intelligence revolution centered in PG&E’s Northern California service area. The massive server farms required for AI development consume vast amounts of electricity, giving PG&E a unique growth opportunity that most other utilities lack. For investors, this new demand is the engine of future profit. Meeting this demand will require billions in new infrastructure investment. For a regulated utility, these capital investments are added to its rate base, which is the core asset portfolio on which the company earns a guaranteed profit. This growth in the rate base directly supports the company's goal of delivering at least 9% annual EPS growth through 2028. This growth story also presents a winning narrative for customers and regulators. As management explained, every gigawatt of new data center load can reduce residential bills by 1-2%, as the grid's high fixed costs are spread over more sales. Confirmed projects with major tech players like Microsoft NASDAQ: MSFT make this growth feel tangible and imminent, positioning PG&E as a key partner in the AI economy. The recent surge in bullish options trading appears to be a rational market signal indicating PG&E's fundamental transformation. The company is successfully moving beyond its recovery phase by stabilizing its operations and proactively managing its risks. More importantly, it has secured a robust, long-term growth catalyst by positioning itself as the energy backbone for the AI industry. For a company long defined by its past challenges, the narrative is compellingly shifting to one of durable, technology-driven growth.

MarketBeat Week in Review – 07/28 - 08/01,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/marketbeat-week-in-review-07-28-08-01/,"Stocks drifted lower to end the week as economic uncertainty overshadowed strong Magnificent Seven earnings. On July 31, the latest Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index showed a slight uptick in the rate of inflation growth. Then on Friday, the August Jobs report came in lighter than expected. However, that number looked bullish compared with massive downward revisions to the May and June numbers. Investors are also weighing the impact of tariffs now that the August 1 deadline has come and gone. On a more bullish note, reports from several mega-cap technology companies reinforce the reality of the artificial intelligence (AI) trade. Many of these companies will spend billions of dollars over several years to build out an AI infrastructure, creating opportunities in several sectors. Next week will be quieter for economic data, but earnings season will continue to roll along. August itself is typically a quiet week for markets. But that low volume can also lead to high volatility. Count on the MarketBeat analysts to help you separate market signals from noise. Here are some of our most popular articles from this week. Articles by Sam Quirke One week after its earnings report, Tesla Inc. NASDAQ: TSLA stock has given up almost all of its post-earnings gains. However, Sam Quirke pointed out why the long-term upside continues to look bullish as Tesla’s robotics and autonomous vehicle solutions begin to emerge. Amazon.com Inc. NASDAQ: AMZN stock dropped despite a solid earnings report. It’s just one example of how investors had priced growth into the company’s results. Quirke explained the long-term bull case and how investors and traders may want to approach the stock. NVIDIA Corp. NASDAQ: NVDA would appear to be a winner as AI spending shows no signs of slowing down. Quirke pointed to two technical indicators that look bearish for NVDA stock despite continued optimism from analysts. Articles by Chris Markoch Palantir Technologies Inc. NASDAQ: PLTR reports earnings next week. Chris Markoch explained why investors will want to pay close attention to the company’s growing defense business as the company becomes the Pentagon’s go-to AI engine. Stocks that form a golden cross pattern can be opportunities for investors. Markoch highlighted three stocks that have recently made a golden cross that is supported by strong fundamentals. Apple Inc. NASDAQ: AAPL delivered a strong earnings report on July 31. However, AAPL stock is delivering muted gains. Markoch explained why investors are skeptical about the sustainability of the company’s results, and what that may mean for a stock that many believe is still priced for perfection. Articles by Ryan Hasson Bitcoin has made a resurgence in July, and this time it’s bringing other tokens with it. This week, Ryan Hasson looked at five stocks set to ride the wave of the crypto surge that investors can own without owning and storing the digital assets. Autonomous technology is the bullish cousin to artificial intelligence. This week, Hasson looked at this sector and provided investors with five autonomous technology stocks trading for less than $15. That means there’s some risk and the potential for outsized gains for patient investors. Hasson also looked at two cybersecurity stocks that are poised for a breakout. As interest in AI continues to grow, so will the threats from AI-driven cyberattacks. Hasson explained why upcoming earnings may be the catalyst that moves these stocks higher. Articles by Gabriel Osorio-Mazilli This week, Gabriel Osorio-Mazilli analyzed the surge in American Eagle Outfitters Inc. NYSE: AEO. More importantly, he looked beyond the noise and explained why the move in AEO stock may have more behind it than speculation. With so many stocks trading at or near all-time highs, it can be hard to find undervalued stocks. However, that’s exactly what Osorio-Mazilli did this week. Not only did he provide investors with the names of three undervalued stocks, but he also pointed out why each has catalysts that the market may be overlooking. Buy-and-hold investors understand the importance of compounding. This week, Osorio-Mazilli pointed these investors to three stocks with attractive outlooks for compounding for years to come. Articles by Leo Miller Investors expected a strong earnings report from Meta Platforms Inc. NASDAQ: META, and the company did not disappoint. Leo Miller summarized the tech giant's strong report and explained why investors should be willing to chase META stock higher. Earnings season is a time when investors seek out analyst upgrades. This week, Miller highlighted three AI stocks that have received bullish upgrades after reporting strong earnings. Earnings season can also be synonymous with stock buybacks. Although that hasn’t been a prominent factor so far in this cycle, Miller highlighted four stocks that have announced significant increases in Q2 buybacks. Articles by Nathan Reiff D-Wave Quantum Inc. NYSE: QBTS has been one of the best-performing stocks in the emerging quantum stock sector. This week, Nathan Reiff pointed out the catalysts that briefly allowed QBTS stock to make a new all-time high, but why investors may still want to proceed with caution. Investors have been waiting for basic materials stocks to take off. However, uncertainty in key economic indicators has weighed on these stocks. Reiff explained why three material stocks are likely to have further upside based on fundamentals and market trends. Defense stocks have been some of the most closely watched stocks for investors. Reiff pointed out why a beaten-down small-cap stock, Byrna Technologies Inc. NASDAQ: BYRN, is one to watch based on bullish analyst sentiment and a strong earnings report. Articles by Dan Schmidt History frequently rhymes, and Dan Schmidt pointed out why 2025 is starting to look a lot like 2021. In both cases, traders were looking for short squeeze candidates. This is a risky strategy, but it can be profitable. Schmidt highlighted three stocks with catalysts that could make them good short-squeeze candidates. It hasn’t been all bad news on the tariff front, Schmidt pointed out why the recent deal between the United States and Japan is bullish for automotive stocks. Schmidt highlighted three automaker stocks that investors may be overlooking. Articles by Jeffrey Neal Johnson “The quantum computing industry is reaching an inflection point.” Jeffrey Neal Johnson highlighted this issue for investors. Johnson explained the key factors driving quantum stocks higher and gave investors three stocks that are among the most promising for long-term investors. Drone stocks have been soaring, which is why Johnson made it a point to highlight Red Cat Holdings Inc. NASDAQ: RCAT. The stock has dropped recently, but a new contract is only one reason why analysts believe there’s significant upside to come. As the AI revolution progresses, investors will want to watch applications on the edge. This week, Johnson pointed out that its application of semiconductors in automotive and internet of Things (IoT) applications makes Qualcomm Inc. NASDAQ: QCOM a growth stock that may be flying under the radar. Articles by Jordan Chussler Healthcare is normally an evergreen sector for investors. However, that hasn’t been the case for several years. Jordan Chussler analyzed the headwinds impacting the healthcare sector and why that adds to the bullish case for HCA Healthcare Inc. NYSE: HCA, which recently issued bullish forward guidance. Before you consider HCA Healthcare, you'll want to hear this."
SpaceX delivers four astronauts to the International Space Station just 15 hours after launch,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/astronauts-take-express-flight-to-the-space-station-arriving-15-hours-after-their-launch-2025-08-02/,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — SpaceX delivered a fresh crew to the International Space Station on Saturday, making the trip in a quick 15 hours. The four U.S., Russian and Japanese astronauts pulled up in their SpaceX capsule after launching from NASA's Kennedy Space Center. They will spend at least six months at the orbiting lab, swapping places with colleagues up there since March. SpaceX will bring those four back as early as Wednesday. Moving in are NASA's Zena Cardman and Mike Fincke, Japan's Kimiya Yui and Russia's Oleg Platonov — each of whom had been originally assigned to other missions. “Hello, space station!” Fincke radioed as soon as the capsule docked high above the South Pacific. Cardman and another astronaut were pulled from a SpaceX flight last year to make room for NASA's two stuck astronauts, Boeing Starliner test pilots Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, whose space station stay went from one week to more than nine months. Fincke and Yui had been training for the next Starliner mission. But with Starliner grounded by thruster and other problems until 2026, the two switched to SpaceX. Platonov was bumped from the Soyuz launch lineup a couple of years ago because of an undisclosed illness. Their arrival temporarily puts the space station population at 11. “It was such an unbelievably beautiful sight to see the space station come into our view for the first time,” Cardman said once on board. While their taxi flight was speedy by U.S. standards, the Russians hold the record for the fastest trip to the space station — a lightning-fast three hours. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

It's Trump's economy now. The latest financial numbers offer some warning signs,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/its-trumps-economy-now-the-latest-financial-numbers-offer-some-warning-signs-2025-08-01/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — For all of President Donald Trump’s promises of an economic “golden age,” a spate of weak indicators this week told a potentially worrisome story as the impacts of his policies are coming into focus. Job gains are dwindling. Inflation is ticking upward. Growth has slowed compared with last year. More than six months into his term, Trump’s blitz of tariff hikes and his new tax and spending bill have remodeled America’s trading, manufacturing, energy and tax systems to his own liking. He’s eager to take credit for any wins that might occur and is hunting for someone else to blame if the financial situation starts to totter. But as of now, this is not the boom the Republican president promised, and his ability to blame his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden, for any economic challenges has faded as the world economy hangs on his every word and social media post. When Friday’s jobs report turned out to be decidedly bleak, Trump ignored the warnings in the data and fired the head of the agency that produces the monthly jobs figures. “Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can’t be manipulated for political purposes,” Trump said on Truth Social, without offering evidence for his claim. “The Economy is BOOMING.” It’s possible that the disappointing numbers are growing pains from the rapid transformation caused by Trump and that stronger growth will return — or they may be a preview of even more disruption to come. Trump's aggressive use of tariffs, executive actions, spending cuts and tax code changes carries significant political risk if he is unable to deliver middle-class prosperity. The effects of his new tariffs are still several months away from rippling through the economy, right as many Trump allies in Congress will be campaigning in the midterm elections. “Considering how early we are in his term, Trump’s had an unusually big impact on the economy already,” said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist at Firehouse Strategies. “The full inflationary impact of the tariffs won’t be felt until 2026. Unfortunately for Republicans, that’s also an election year.” The White House portrayed the blitz of trade frameworks leading up to Thursday's tariff announcement as proof of his negotiating prowess. The European Union, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Indonesia and other nations that the White House declined to name agreed that the U.S. could increase its tariffs on their goods without doing the same to American products. Trump simply set rates on other countries that lacked settlements. The costs of those tariffs — taxes paid on imports to the U.S. — will be most felt by many Americans in the form of higher prices, but to what extent remains uncertain. “For the White House and their allies, a key part of managing the expectations and politics of the Trump economy is maintaining vigilance when it comes to public perceptions,” said Kevin Madden, a Republican strategist. Just 38% of adults approve of Trump’s handling of the economy, according to a July poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs. That’s down from the end of Trump’s first term when half of adults approved of his economic leadership. The White House paints a rosier image, seeing the economy emerging from a period of uncertainty after Trump’s restructuring and repeating the economic gains seen in his first term before the pandemic struck. “President Trump is implementing the very same policy mix of deregulation, fairer trade, and pro-growth tax cuts at an even bigger scale – as these policies take effect, the best is yet to come,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said. The economic numbers over the past week show the difficulties that Trump might face if the numbers continue on their current path: — Friday's jobs report showed that U.S. employers have shed 37,000 manufacturing jobs since Trump's tariff launch in April, undermining prior White House claims of a factory revival. — Net hiring has plummeted over the past three months with job gains of just 73,000 in July, 14,000 in June and 19,000 in May — a combined 258,000 jobs lower than previously indicated. On average last year, the economy added 168,000 jobs a month. — A Thursday inflation report showed that prices have risen 2.6% over the year that ended in June, an increase in the personal consumption expenditures price index from 2.2% in April. Prices of heavily imported items, such as appliances, furniture, and toys and games, jumped from May to June. — On Wednesday, a report on gross domestic product — the broadest measure of the U.S. economy — showed that it grew at an annual rate of less than 1.3% during the first half of the year, down sharply from 2.8% growth last year. “The economy's just kind of slogging forward,” said Guy Berger, senior fellow at the Burning Glass Institute, which studies employment trends. “Yes, the unemployment rate’s not going up, but we’re adding very few jobs. The economy’s been growing very slowly. It just looks like a ‘meh’ economy is continuing.” Trump has sought to pin the blame for any economic troubles on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, saying the Fed should cut its benchmark interest rates even though doing so could generate more inflation. Trump has publicly backed two Fed governors, Christoper Waller and Michelle Bowman, for voting for rate cuts at Wednesday's meeting. But their logic is not what the president wants to hear: They were worried, in part, about a slowing job market. But this is a major economic gamble being undertaken by Trump and those pushing for lower rates under the belief that mortgages will also become more affordable as a result and boost homebuying activity. His tariff policy has changed repeatedly over the last six months, with the latest import tax numbers serving as a substitute for what the president announced in April, which provoked a stock market sell-off. It might not be a simple one-time adjustment as some Fed board members and Trump administration officials argue. Of course, Trump can't say no one warned him about the possible consequences of his economic policies. Biden, then the outgoing president, did just that in a speech last December at the Brookings Institution, saying the cost of the tariffs would eventually hit American workers and businesses. “He seems determined to impose steep, universal tariffs on all imported goods brought into this country on the mistaken belief that foreign countries will bear the cost of those tariffs rather than the American consumer,” Biden said. “I believe this approach is a major mistake.”"
"Who is Erika McEntarfer, the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner fired by Trump?",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/who-is-erika-mcentarfer-the-bureau-of-labor-statistics-commissioner-fired-by-trump-2025-08-01/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The head of the agency that compiles the closely watched monthly jobs report usually toils in obscurity, but on Friday, the current holder of that job was loudly fired by the president of the United States. Erika McEntarfer, a longtime government employee, bore the brunt of President Donald Trump’s unhappiness with Friday’s jobs report, which showed that hiring had slowed in July and was much less in May and June that previously estimated. He accused her without evidence of manipulating the job numbers and noted she was an appointee of President Joe Biden. McEntarfer, a longtime government worker who had served as BLS head for a year and a half, did not immediately respond to a request for comment by The Associated Press. But her predecessor overseeing the jobs agency, former co-workers and associates have denounced the firing, warning about its repercussions and saying McEntarfer was nonpolitical in her role. Here’s what to know about Erika McEntarfer: McEntarfer, whose research focuses on job loss, retirement, worker mobility, and wage rigidity, had previously worked at the Census Bureau’s Center for Economic Studies, the Treasury Department’s Office of Tax Policy and the White House Council of Economic Advisers in a nonpolitical role. She has a bachelor's degree in Social Science from Bard College and a doctoral degree in economics from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. McEntarfer was nominated in 2023 to serve as BLS head, and the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions recommended that her nomination go to the full Senate for a vote. She was confirmed as BLS commissioner in January 2024 on a bipartisan 86-8 Senate vote. Among the Republican senators who voted to confirm her included then-Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, who is now Trump's vice president, and then-Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who is now Trump's secretary of state. Before her confirmation hearing, a group called the Friends of the BLS, made up of former commissioners who served in both Democratic and Republican administrations, members of statistical associations and credentialed economists, said McEntarfer's background made her a great choice for the job. “The many reasons to quickly confirm Dr. McEntarfer as the new BLS Commissioner all boil down to this: the agency, like the entire statistical system, is undergoing an intense, significant period of change and Dr. McEntarfer’s wealth of research and statistical experience have equipped her to be the strong leader that BLS needs to meet these challenges,” Friends of the BLS wrote. William Beach, who was appointed BLS commissioner in 2019 by Trump and served until 2023 during President Joe Biden's administration, called McEntarfer's firing “groundless” and said in an X post that it “sets a dangerous precedent and undermines the statistical mission of the Bureau.” Former Labor Department chief economist Sarah J. Glynn, who received regular briefings from McEntarfer about BLS findings, said McEntarfer was generous with her time explaining what conclusions could or couldn’t be reached from the data. If the data didn’t support something an administration official was saying, McEntarfer would say so, Glynn said. She also never weighed in on how the administration should present or interpret the data, Glynn said — she would simply answer questions about the data. “She had a sterling reputation as someone who is concerned about the accuracy of the data and not someone who puts a political spin on her work,” Glynn said. Heather Boushey, a senior research fellow at Harvard University, served with McEntarfer on the White House Council of Economic Advisers and said McEntarfer never talked politics at work. “She showed up every day to focus on the best analysis and the best approach to her field and not get political. That is what I saw from her time and again. She is brilliant and well-respected among labor economists generally,” Boushey said. “She wasn’t coming into my office to talk politics or the political implications of something. She definitely wasn’t engaging on that side of things.” ___ Olson reported from New York. Associated Press writer Christopher Rugaber in Washington contributed to this report."
"American Eagle responds to critics over ad with Sydney Sweeney, saying it was always about the jeans",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/american-eagle-responds-to-critics-over-ad-with-sydney-sweeney-saying-it-was-always-about-the-jeans-2025-08-01/,"NEW YORK (AP) — Teen retailer American Eagle Outfitters has a message to its critics, who took issue over its denim ad campaign with 27-year-old actor Sydney Sweeney that sparked a debate over race and Western beauty standards. The campaign, the retailer said, was always about the jeans. In a statement posted on American Eagle's Instagram account on Friday, the retailer said the ad campaign “is and always was about the jeans. Her jeans. Her story. We'll continue to celebrate how everyone wears their AE jeans with confidence, their way. Great jeans look good on everyone.” The message marked the first time the teen retailer responded to days of backlash since the ad with the tagline “Sydney Sweeney has great jeans” launched last week. In the run-up to the ad blitz, the company's chief marketing officer told trade media outlets that it included “clever, even provocative language” and was “definitely going to push buttons."" It's unclear if the company knew how much controversy the ad could raise. Most of the negative reception focused on videos that used the word “genes” instead of “jeans” when discussing the blonde-haired, blue-eyed actor known for the HBO series “Euphoria” and “White Lotus.” Critics found the most troubling was a teaser video in which Sweeney says, “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color. My jeans are blue.” The video appeared on American Eagle’s Facebook page and other social media channels but is not part of the ad campaign. Some critics saw the wordplay as a nod, either unintentional or deliberate, to eugenics, a discredited theory that held humanity could be improved through selective breeding for certain traits. Other commenters accused detractors of reading too much into the campaign’s message. Some marketing experts said the buzz is always good even if it’s not uniformly positive. “If you try to follow all the rules, you’ll make lots of people happy, but you’ll fail,” Allen Adamson, co-founder of marketing consultancy Metaforce said. “The rocket won’t take off.” Before you consider Meta Platforms, you'll want to hear this."

"Columbia Sportswear sues Columbia University, alleging merchandise too similar and causes confusion",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/columbia-sportswear-sues-columbia-university-alleging-merchandise-too-similar-and-causes-confusion-2025-08-01/,"NEW YORK (AP) — Outerwear retailer Columbia Sportswear has sued Columbia University over alleged trademark infringement and a breach of contract, saying that the university’s merchandise looks too similar to its own offerings and can confuse shoppers. In a lawsuit filed July 23 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon, Columbia Sportswear, whose roots date back to 1938, alleges that the Ivy League university intentionally violated an agreement the parties signed on June 13, 2023. That agreement dictated how the university could use the word “Columbia” on its own apparel and accessories. As part of the pact, the university could feature “Columbia” on its merchandise provided that the name included a recognizable school insignia or its mascot, the word “university,” the name of the academic department or the founding year of the university — 1754 — or a combination. Columbia Sportswear clothing is sold at more than 800 retail locations including more than 150 of its branded stores as well as its website and third-party marketplaces. But Columbia Sportswear alleges the university breached the agreement a little more than a year later, with the Portland, Oregon-based company noticing several garments without any of the school logos being sold at the Columbia University online store. Many of the garments feature a bright blue color that is “confusingly similar” to the blue color that has long been associated with Columbia Sportswear, the suit alleged. The lawsuit offered photos of some of the Columbia University items that say only Columbia. “The likelihood of deception, confusion, and mistake engendered by the university’s misappropriation and misuse of the Columbia name is causing irreparable harm to the brand and goodwill symbolized by Columbia Sportswear’s registered mark Columbia and the reputation for quality it embodies,” the lawsuit alleged. The lawsuit comes at a time when Columbia University has been threatened with the potential loss of billions of dollars in government support. Last week, Columbia University reached a deal with the Trump administration to pay more than $220 million to the federal government to restore federal research money that was canceled in the name of combating antisemitism on campus. Under the agreement, the Ivy League school will pay a $200 million settlement over three years, the university said. Columbia Sportswear aims to stop all sales of clothing that violate the agreement, recall any products already sold and donate any remaining merchandise to charity. Columbia Sportswear is also seeking three times the amount of actual damages determined by a jury. Neither Columbia Sportswear nor Columbia University could be immediately reached for comment."
Will Hims & Hers Fall Along With Novo Nordisk?,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/will-hims-and-hers-fall-along-with-novo-nordisk/,"One of the most widely watched names in the healthcare sector is Hims & Hers Health Inc. NYSE: HIMS, not only due to its rampant price action over the past six months, but also because of its underlying growth story, which almost makes it feel like a miracle in the making. The reason behind its popularity lies in the fact that it combines the safety of health services along with the sort of growth reserved for the technology space of the market. However, most investors have associated Hims & Hers stock with the world of weight loss lately, in a sort of Ozempic boom. Given the company's recent entry into this space, this association has some justification. However, these assumptions overlook the fact that the company was already on a path to success and compounding growth before making this decision. The stakes are particularly high, along with uncertainty, now that shares of Novo Nordisk NYSE: NVO have fallen by as much as 31% over the past month alone. The bearish reaction was triggered by regulatory intervention and investigations into weight loss products, which specifically targeted Novo Nordisk due to its overconcentration in the product and limited diversification. Due to correlation regimes, it is likely that shares of Hims & Hers stock will also experience a slight slump. However, the fundamentals dictate that the decline shouldn’t be as harsh as it was for Novo Nordisk. With a diversified product offering and a completely different business model, here is why Hims & Hers might make it out okay. Hims & Hers leverages the world of telehealth in a way that Novo Nordisk can’t, and that means operating as a remote platform that monetizes through the best way investors tend to look for in every business: Subscriptions. Because over 90% of the company’s revenue comes through subscriptions, Hims & Hers might hold stronger than expected. This is because subscriptions enable investors and Wall Street analysts to more accurately predict future financials in any business, as the churn rate tends to be significantly lower, particularly in healthcare services. With this in mind, the fact that Hims & Hers stock still trades at 95% of its 52-week high should be a strong sign that optimism is still alive. On the other hand, Novo Nordisk has fallen to a dismal 35% of its 52-week high, showing investors how aware the market is that Hims & Hers is not as exposed to weight loss products as Novo Nordisk is today. The probability that this momentum will continue into the future is high, and evidence can be found in the company's fundamentals. Investors examining Hims & Hers' latest quarterly results will see no reason for the stock to decline in the near future, despite some concerns about its weight loss product exposure. Revenue has surged 111% over the past year, clearly indicating strong demand for this innovative health platform. The main driver of this growth is the swift and aggressive adoption rate and ongoing expansion of market share that the company consistently reports. Subscribers grew to 2.4 million, up 38% compared to the same quarter last year. This isn’t just slight price increases per subscription but also attractive growth in the company’s user base, which is the main driver in any technology or subscription-based company. Another factor investors need to keep in mind is that Hims & Hers management reiterated its full-year financial guidance for 2025. This is a strong point, considering that other companies have chosen not to provide guidance due to the current trade tariffs and inflation uncertainty in the economy. One benefit of having a business model as predictable and stable as this one is that it provides certainty in a market where every investor needs it. All told, this financial growth boiled down to one of the most important metrics: free cash flow (operating cash flow minus capital expenditures). Free cash flow was reported at up to $50.1 million for this quarter, which is up nearly fivefold compared to the $11,9 million reported for the same quarter last year. This metric matters because it represents the most raw form of compounding potential, as free cash flow is typically used for reinvestments to drive further growth. All the evidence, both technical momentum and fundamental growth, seems to point to very low chances of Hims & Hers falling with Novo Nordisk, and that is one conviction investors can take for this name moving forward. Before you consider Hims & Hers Health, you'll want to hear this."
AMA and other medical associations are kicked out of CDC vaccine workgroups,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/ama-and-other-medical-associations-are-kicked-out-of-cdc-vaccine-workgroups-2025-08-01/,"NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. health officials have told more than a half-dozen of the nation's top medical organizations that they will no longer help establish vaccination recommendations. The government told the organizations on Thursday via email that their experts are being disinvited from the workgroups that have been the backbone of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. The organizations include the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Infectious Diseases Society of America. “I’m concerned and distressed,” said Dr. William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University vaccine expert who for decades has been involved with ACIP and its workgroups. He said the move will likely propel a confusing fragmentation of vaccine guidance, as patients may hear the government say one thing and hear their doctors say another. One email said the organizations are “special interest groups and therefore are expected to have a ‘bias’ based on their constituency and/or population that they represent.” A federal health official on Friday confirmed the action, which was first reported by Bloomberg. The decision was the latest development in what has become a saga involving the ACIP. The committee, created in 1964, makes recommendations to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on how vaccines that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration should be used. CDC directors have traditionally almost always approved those recommendations, which are widely heeded by doctors and greenlight insurance coverage for shots. U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was a leading voice in the anti-vaccine movement before becoming the U.S. government’s top health official, and in June abruptly fired the entire ACIP after accusing them of being too closely aligned with manufacturers. He handpicked replacements that include several vaccine skeptics. The workgroups typically include committee members and experts from medical and scientific organizations. At workgroup meetings, members evaluate data from vaccine manufacturers and the CDC, and formulate vaccination recommendation proposals to be presented to the full committee. The structure was created for several reasons, Schaffner said. The professional groups provide input about what might and might not be possible for doctors to implement. And it helped build respect and trust in ACIP recommendations, having the buy-in of respected medical organizations, he said. Workgroup members are vetted for conflicts of interest, to make sure than no one who had, say, made money from working on a hepatitis vaccine was placed on the hepatitis committee, Schaffner noted. Also disinvited from the groups were the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American College of Physicians, the American Geriatrics Society, the American Osteopathic Association, the National Medical Association and the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. In a joint statement Friday, the AMA and several of the other organizations said: “To remove our deep medical expertise from this vital and once transparent process is irresponsible, dangerous to our nation’s health, and will further undermine public and clinician trust in vaccines.” They urged the administration to reconsider the move ""so we can continue to feel confident in its vaccine recommendations for our patients.” Some of the professional organizations have criticized Kennedy’s changes to the ACIP, and three of the disinvited groups last month joined a lawsuit against the government over Kennedy’s decision to stop recommending COVID-19 vaccines for most children and pregnant women. In a social media post Friday, one of the Kennedy-appointed ACIP members — Retsef Levi — wrote that the working groups “will engage experts from even broader set of disciplines!” Levi, a business management professor, also wrote that working group membership “will be based on merit & expertise — not membership in organizations proven to have (conflicts of interest) and radical & narrow view of public health!” HHS officials have not said which people are going to be added to the ACIP workgroups. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

The surprisingly weak hiring numbers led investors to step up their expectations for an interest rate cut in September and sent Treasury yields sharply lower in the bond market. The new set of tariffs are set to go into effect Aug. 7. On Friday: The S&P 500 fell 101.38 points, or 1.6%, to 6,238.01. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 542.40 points, or 1.2%, to 43,588.58. The Nasdaq composite fell 472.32 points, or 2.2%, to 20,650.13. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 44.87 points, or 2%, to 2,166.78. For the week: The S&P 500 is down 150.63 points, or 2.4%. The Dow is down 1,313.34 points, or 2.9%. The Nasdaq is down 458.18 points, or 2.2%. The Russell 2000 is down 94.29 points, or 4.2%. For the year: The S&P 500 is up 356.38 points, or 6.1%. The Dow is up 1,044.36 points, or 2.5%. The Nasdaq is up 1,339.34 points, or 6.9%. The Russell 2000 is down 63.38 points, or 2.8%."

"Federal Reserve Governor Kugler steps down, giving Trump slot to fill",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/federal-reserve-governor-kugler-steps-down-giving-trump-slot-to-fill-2025-08-01/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve announced Friday that governor Adriana Kugler will step down next week, opening up a spot on the central bank's powerful board that President Donald Trump will be able to fill. Kugler, who did not participate in the Fed's policy meeting earlier this week, would have completed her term in January. Instead, she will retire Aug. 8. She did not provide a reason for stepping down in her resignation letter. Federal Reserve governors vote on the central bank's interest rate decisions and also on changes to bank regulations and other financial rules. The Trump administration could take advantage of Kugler's resignation and appoint a potential replacement for Fed Chair Jerome Powell to replace her. Powell, who has been repeatedly attacked by Trump for not reducing the Fed's key short-term interest rate, completes his term as chair in May 2026. Trump said Friday afternoon he was “very happy” to have an opportunity to name someone to the Fed's board. Several names have been floated as potential replacements for Powell, including Kevin Hassett, currently a top economic adviser to Trump, and Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor from 2006 to 2011. Asked about potential candidates, Trump said he has “about three very good – I’ve got a lot of good candidates."" Trump has continued his attacks on the Fed since Powell said Wednesday that the central bank would keep its short-term interest rate unchanged. Powell also said the Fed could take months to evaluate the impact of tariffs on the economy before deciding to cut rates, as Trump has demanded. Powell is “a stubborn MORON, must substantially lower interest rates, NOW,"" Trump posted early Friday morning, before the monthly jobs report was released. That report showed hiring slowed in July and was much lower in May and June than had been initially reported. Kugler was appointed to the Fed's seven-member board of governors by former President Joe Biden in September 2023. She was the first Hispanic Fed governor, and prior to joining the Fed, was a professor at Georgetown University and was the U.S. representative to the World Bank. She will return to the Georgetown faculty in the fall. “I am proud to have tackled this role with integrity, a strong commitment to serving the public, and with a data-driven approach strongly based on my expertise in labor markets and inflation,” she said in her resignation letter. In her last speech as a Fed governor two weeks ago, Kugler expressed support for Powell's view that the central bank should keep rates unchanged while officials monitor the economy to see how Trump's tariffs affect inflation and the economy. Trump, meanwhile, has said he will appoint Fed officials who favor cutting rates. One complication is that Powell's term as chair ends in May 2026. But his position on the Fed's governing board lasts through January 2028. As a result, he could stay on the board even after stepping down as chair, and simply remain as one of seven governors. There is some precedent for such a step: Marriner Eccles, who served as Fed chair in the 1930s, remained on the board after completing his term as chair. If Powell took such a step, that would mean whomever the Trump administration chose to replace Kugler could then be elevated to chair after Powell finishes as chair in May 2026. In other words, to get their choice of Fed Chair in 2026, the Trump White House may choose to appoint that person to replace Kugler as governor, and then elevate them to Fed chair in May 2026. Powell has declined to answer at the last two press conferences whether he will leave the board when he is done as chair. ____ AP Writer Will Weissert contributed to this report."
"NFL on the verge of selling media assets to ESPN for an equity stake in the network, AP sources say",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/nfl-on-the-verge-of-selling-media-assets-to-espn-for-an-equity-stake-in-the-network-ap-source-says-2025-08-01/,"The NFL and ESPN are expected to announce an agreement next week under which most of the league's significant media holdings would go to the sports network. People familiar with the transaction said the multibillion-dollar deal would give the NFL an equity stake in ESPN. The people spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the deal has not been finalized. It was first reported by The Athletic. The NFL and ESPN had no comment. The NFL has been trying to sell its media properties for nearly five years. ESPN and the league have been involved in on-again, off-again talks for the past three years. The proposed move comes as ESPN is expected to soon launch its direct-to-consumer service, possibly before the end of August. The service would give cord cutters access to all of ESPN's programs and networks for $29.99 per month. Most cable, satellite and viewers who have streaming services will receive the service for free as part of their subscription. ESPN would get access to the popular RedZone channel, as well as NFL Network and an additional seven regular-season games (six international and a Saturday afternoon late-season contest). A couple of weeks ago, ESPN announced that NFL Network host Rich Eisen's three-hour program would air on ESPN Radio as well as stream on Disney+ and ESPN+. “The Rich Eisen Show” is not affiliated with NFL Network. ESPN has carried NFL games since 1987 and “Monday Night Football” since 2006. Under the current TV contract, it will have the 2027 and 2031 Super Bowls for the first time. NFL Network started in November 2003 and was the second major pro league to have its own network. NBA TV started in 1999, MLB Network in 2009 and NHL Network in the United States in 2007. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl"
"Corporation for Public Broadcasting to shut down after being defunded by Congress, targeted by Trump",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/corporation-for-public-broadcasting-to-shut-down-after-being-defunded-by-congress-targeted-by-trump-2025-08-01/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a cornerstone of American culture for three generations, announced Friday it would take steps toward its own closure after being defunded by Congress — marking the end of a nearly six-decade era in which it fueled the production of renowned educational programming, cultural content and even emergency alerts. The demise of the corporation, known as CPB, is a direct result of President Donald Trump's targeting of public media, which he has repeatedly said is spreading political and cultural views antithetical to those the United States should be espousing. The closure is expected to have a profound impact on the journalistic and cultural landscape — in particular, public radio and TV stations in small communities across the United States. CPB helps fund both PBS and NPR, but most of its funding is distributed to more than 1,500 local public radio and television stations around the country. The corporation also has deep ties to much of the nation’s most familiar programming, from NPR’s “All Things Considered” to, historically, “Sesame Street,” “Mister Rogers' Neighborhood” and the documentaries of Ken Burns. The corporation said its end, 58 years after being signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson, would come in an “orderly wind-down.” In a statement, it said the decision came after the passage through Congress of a package that clawed back its funding for the next two budget years — about $1.1 billion. Then, the Senate Appropriations Committee reinforced that policy change Thursday by excluding funding for the corporation for the first time in more than 50 years as part of a broader spending bill. “Despite the extraordinary efforts of millions of Americans who called, wrote, and petitioned Congress to preserve federal funding for CPB, we now face the difficult reality of closing our operations,” said Patricia Harrison, the corporation’s president and CEO. Democratic members of the Senate Appropriations Committee made a last-ditch effort this week to save the CBP's funding. As part of Thursday's committee deliberations, Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., authored but then withdrew an amendment to restore CPB funding for the coming budget year. She said she still believed there was a path forward “to fix this before there are devastating consequences for public radio and television stations across the country.” “It's hard to believe we’ve ended up in the situation we’re in,” she said. “And I’m going to continue to work with my colleagues to fix it.” But Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., sounded a less optimistic tone. “I understand your concerns, but we all know we litigated this two weeks ago,” Capito said. “Adopting this amendment would have been contrary to what we have already voted on.” CPB said it informed employees Friday that most staff positions will end with the fiscal year on Sept. 30. It said a small transition team will stay in place until January to finish any remaining work — including, it said, “ensuring continuity for music rights and royalties that remain essential to the public media system.” “Public media has been one of the most trusted institutions in American life, providing educational opportunity, emergency alerts, civil discourse, and cultural connection to every corner of the country,” Harrison said. “We are deeply grateful to our partners across the system for their resilience, leadership, and unwavering dedication to serving the American people.” NPR stations use millions of dollars in federal money to pay music licensing fees. Now, many will have to renegotiate these deals. That could impact, in particular, outlets that build their programming around music discovery. NPR President and CEO Katherine Maher estimated recently, for example, that some 96% of all classical music broadcast in the United States is on public radio stations. Federal money for public radio and television has traditionally been appropriated to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which distributes it to NPR and PBS. Roughly 70% of the money goes directly to the 330 PBS and 246 NPR stations across the country, although that’s only a shorthand way to describe its potential impact. Trump, who has called the CPB a “monstrosity,” has long said that public broadcasting displays an extreme liberal bias, helped create the momentum in recent months for an anti-public broadcasting groundswell among his supporters in Congress and around the country. It is part of a larger initiative in which he has targeted institutions — particularly cultural ones — that produce content or espouse attitudes that he considers “un-American.” The CPB’s demise represents a political victory for those efforts. His impact on the media landscape has been profound. He has also gone after U.S. government media that had independence charters, including the venerable Voice of America, ending that media outlet’s operations after many decades. Trump also fired three members of the corporation’s board of directors in April. In legal action at the time, the fired directors said their dismissal was governmental overreach targeting an entity whose charter guarantees it independence. ___"
Play It Cool: Why Comfort Systems USA Is a Hidden AI Winner,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/play-it-cool-why-comfort-systems-usa-is-a-hidden-ai-winner/,"Suppose you heard mention of a stock that’s ridden the artificial intelligence wave to a 1,300% gain over the last five years. In that scenario, you’d probably envision industries like semiconductors, computer software, or maybe cybersecurity. You’d likely NOT think of an industrial conglomerate that installs air conditioning, but sometimes markets have a sense of humor. One of the AI revolution’s biggest winners has been Comfort Systems USA Inc. NYSE: FIX, a $25 billion HVAC company reaping the benefits of the data center gold rush. If its order backlog is any indication, FIX investors will be staying cool well into next year. Artificial intelligence agents may not need to eat, drink, or sleep like humans, but they do need the temperature to be just right. AI data centers consume tremendous amounts of energy, with a significant portion of that energy being used for sophisticated cooling systems. If you think your energy bills are high in the summer, imagine trying to keep hundreds of thousands of NVIDIA Corp. NASDAQ: NVDA GPUs from overheating under unprecedented usage. AI superscalers require specialized HVAC solutions to meet their rapidly expanding needs, with data center cooling expected to become a $42 billion industry by 2032. That’s a 12.4% compound annual growth rate! This quickly growing market is precisely what companies like Comfort Systems USA are capitalizing on with innovative and customized HVAC solutions. Comfort Systems USA is actually 45 different companies in one, operating across a vast swath of the U.S. in services like construction, property maintenance, automation controls, and mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) systems. Their expertise in the latter area gives the company an advantage when working with AI data centers. Using a strategy called Modular Construction, FIX can fabricate crucial components like air handling units or utility plants off-site and then install them on location. This technique was designed to reduce costs and lead times but also creates a safer construction site environment and enhances quality control. The company’s Immersion Cooling is another innovative solution AI hyperscalers crave, as it supplies data centers with precise temperature management systems so servers can be packed closer together, thereby saving on energy consumption. Most importantly, modular construction allows Comfort Systems USA to scale projects quickly. And if Meta Platforms Inc. NASDAQ: META and Microsoft Corp. NASDAQ: MSFT earnings this week provide any hints, the demand for data center equipment is only going up from here. What makes an industrial sector stock jump 22% in a day? An earnings report like the one Comfort Systems USA delivered on July 24. The company comfortably topped revenue projections, growing sales 20% year-over-year (YOY) with gross margins jumping from 20.1% to 23.5%. The $6.53 EPS figure was nearly double the Q2 number from last year, and the company’s $250 million net cash pile gives it plenty of room for more acquisitions. But the real golden nugget in this report was the company’s backlog, which is blowing away even the most optimistic projections. For the first time in the company’s history, its backlog exceeded $8 billion, jumping from $6.89 billion to $8.12 billion between Q1 and Q2. At this time last year, FIX’s backlog stood at $5.77 billion. Tacking on more than $2 billion in just 12 months (growth of more than 40%!) shows the immense demand for cooling solutions from AI data centers, and the company seems to have no problem shifting its growing tariff burdens onto customers. A backlog of this magnitude indicates that FIX is well-positioned to continue growing revenue at a rapid pace into 2026 and beyond. Following the report, FIX stock received its highest analyst price boost yet, a $810 price target from DA Davidson, which suggests further upside of at least 15%. Comfort Systems USA is giving investors plenty of reasons to be bullish, and the daily chart also shows an uptrend firmly intact following a Golden Cross signal last month and a parabolic jump following earnings. The 50-day moving average was established as a support level in the days before the report, and volume spiked to its highest level since April following the release. If there’s a fly in the ointment, it's short-term trading signals like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) hinting at an overextended rally. The RSI screeched higher to 82, well above the 70 number typically considered Oversold territory. The RSI rolling average is also creeping near 70, and the stock traded down in the two days following earnings. Profit-taking following a 60% year-to-date (YTD) gain is never a bad idea, and new investors might find a better entry point later in the next few weeks, once the post-earnings volatility subsides. Before you consider Comfort Systems USA, you'll want to hear this."

Trump removes official overseeing jobs data after dismal employment report,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-seeks-to-fire-official-overseeing-jobs-data-after-weak-employment-report-2025-08-01/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Friday removed the head of the agency that produces the monthly jobs figures after a report showed hiring slowed in July and was much weaker in May and June than previously reported. Trump, in a post on his social media platform, alleged that the figures were manipulated for political reasons and said that Erika McEntarfer, the director of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden, should be fired. He provided no evidence for the charge. “I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY,” Trump said on Truth Social. “She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified.” Trump later posted: “In my opinion, today’s Jobs Numbers were RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad.” The charge that the data was faked is an explosive one that threatens to undercut the political legitimacy of the U.S. government's economic data, which has long been seen as the “gold standard” of economic measurement globally. Economists and Wall Street investors have for decades generally accepted the data as free from political bias. Trump’s move to fire McEntarfer represented another extraordinary assertion of presidential power. He has wielded the authority of the White House to try to control the world’s international trade system, media companies, America’s top universities and Congress’ constitutional power of the purse, among other institutions. McEntarfer's firing was roundly condemned by a group that included two former BLS commissioners, including William Beach, who was appointed by Trump to the position. They particularly objected to the charge that the data was altered for political reasons. “This rationale for firing Dr. McEntarfer is without merit and undermines the credibility of federal economic statistics that are a cornerstone of intelligent economic decision-making by businesses, families, and policymakers,” the statement from the group, the Friends of BLS, said. In addition to Beach, the statement was signed by Erica Groshen, BLS commissioner under former President Barack Obama. “Firing the Commissioner ... when the BLS revises jobs numbers down (as it routinely does) threatens to destroy trust in core American institutions, and all government statistics,” Arin Dube, an economist at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, said on X. “I can’t stress how damaging this is.” After Trump's initial post, Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer said on X that McEntarfer was no longer leading the bureau and that William Wiatrowski, the deputy commissioner, would serve as the acting director. “I support the President’s decision to replace Biden’s Commissioner and ensure the American People can trust the important and influential data coming from BLS,” Chavez-DeRemer said. Friday’s jobs report showed that just 73,000 jobs were added last month and that 258,000 fewer jobs were created in May and June than previously estimated. The report suggested that the economy has sharply weakened during Trump's tenure, a pattern consistent with a slowdown in economic growth during the first half of the year and an increase in inflation during June that appeared to reflect the price pressures created by the president's tariffs. “What does a bad leader do when they get bad news? Shoot the messenger,” Democratic Senate Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said in a Friday speech. McEntarfer was nominated by Biden in 2023 and became the Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics in January 2024. Commissioners typically serve four-year terms but since they are political appointees can be fired. The commissioner is the only political appointee of the agency, which has hundreds of career civil servants. The Senate confirmed McEntarfer to her post 86-8, with now Vice President JD Vance among the yea votes. Trump focused much of his ire on the revisions the agency made to previous hiring data. Job gains in May were revised down to just 19,000 from a previously revised 125,000, and for June they were cut to 14,000 from 147,000. In July, only 73,000 positions were added. The unemployment rate ticked up to a still-low 4.2% from 4.1%. “No one can be that wrong? We need accurate Jobs Numbers,” Trump wrote. “She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified. Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can’t be manipulated for political purposes.” Trump has not always been so suspicious of the monthly jobs report and responded enthusiastically after the initial May figures came out on June 6, when it was initially reported that the economy added 139,000 jobs. “GREAT JOB NUMBERS, STOCK MARKET UP BIG!” Trump posted at the time. That estimate was later revised down to 125,000 jobs, prior to the most recent revision down to just 19,000. During the 2016 campaign, Trump was more critical: He often attacked the jobs figures as they showed the unemployment rate steadily declining while Obama was still president, only to immediately switch to praising the data once he was in office, as steady job gains continued. The monthly employment report is one of the most closely-watched pieces of government economic data and can cause sharp swings in financial markets. The disappointing figure sent U.S. market indexes about 1.5% lower on Friday. The revisions to the May and June numbers were quite large and surprising to many economists. At the same time, every monthly jobs report includes revisions to the prior two months' figures. Those revisions occur as the government receives more responses from businesses to its survey, which helps provide a more complete picture of employment trends each month. In the past decade, companies have taken longer to respond, which may have contributed to larger monthly revisions. The proportion of companies responding to the surveys has also fallen steadily over the past 10 years, but the survey still gets responses from roughly 200,000 business locations, which can be independent companies or franchises of larger chains. The monthly jobs report has long been closely guarded within the BLS, with early copies held in safes under lock and key to prevent any leaks or early dissemination."

"Online creators, led by MrBeast and Mark Rober, want to raise $40 million for clean water access",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/online-creators-led-by-mrbeast-and-mark-rober-want-to-raise-40-million-for-clean-water-access-2025-08-01/,"NEW YORK (AP) — Online creators from dozens of countries, led by MrBeast and popular science YouTuber Mark Rober, are launching a $40 million fundraiser to build water quality projects around the world. The monthlong crowdfunding campaign, touted as the biggest YouTube collaboration and called #TeamWater, promises to rally their combined 2 billion subscribers around combating unsafe water sources. Funds will primarily benefit WaterAid, an international nonprofit that builds community-tailored infrastructure ranging from solar-powered wells to rainwater harvesting systems. More than 2 billion people lacked access to safely managed drinking water as of 2022, according to the United Nations. Organizers want to put a dent in that figure by providing sustainable access for 2 million people — and instilling new generations with a lifelong commitment to advocacy. Joining #TeamWater are smaller creators and some of the biggest names online such as streaming giant Kai Cenat, trendy YouTubers the Stokes Twins and sports entertainers Dude Perfect. Whether they are filming serious explainers or silly water-themed challenges, creators are encouraged to produce content that is authentic to their brand. Water access was identified as a solvable issue that could also unite their mass global following. But MrBeast CEO Jeff Housenbold acknowledged they are better awareness builders than infield executors So, they sought a partner with global reach, existing community partnerships and long-term change-making abilities. That led them to WaterAid. The organization first started talking with MrBeast's team two years ago, according to WaterAid America CEO Kelly Parsons. She said WaterAid typically engages communities for up to a year designing the proper solution. That work sometimes involves training local water technicians. “It all begins and ends in the communities we work with and through them to ensure design that lasts,” Parsons said. “It’s about people more than about plumbing.” While WaterAid would did not provide a list of all the places where funds would go, countries include Colombia, Bangladesh, Ecuador, Malawi and Kenya. Charity partners GivePower and the Alok Foundation are also helping implementation in rural Kenya and Brazil, respectively. U.S.-based projects include an atmospheric water generator for an assisted living facility in Jackson, Mississippi, where the fragile water system nearly collapsed three years ago. The nonprofit DigDeep is helping fix crumbling infrastructure in the small town of Rhodell, West Virginia. Alex and Alan Stokes, whose 129 million subscribers make them one of YouTube's biggest channels, filmed in a Nepalese village where the campaign is building a 15,000-liter tank. The trip recalled their own upbringing in a Chinese town where their grandfather walked miles to fill 5-gallon water jugs. “Being there in person was definitely one of those experiences that brought it all back for us,” Alex said. “(We) saw these kids there and it just reminded us a lot of our childhood as well.” The multi-platform drive follows the 2019 #TeamTrees and 2021 #TeamSeas campaigns, which reportedly drew more than $50 million altogether. That money helped plant millions of trees and remove millions of pounds of waste from bodies of water. Those humanitarian efforts, however, drew criticism that they promoted oversimplified solutions to complicated issues and applied Band-Aids instead of addressing the main drivers of forest loss or ocean pollution. “Ideally, you would not use philanthropy simply to take away the symptoms of whatever is the problem,"" said Patricia Illingworth, a Northeastern University philosophy professor who writes about ethics in philanthropy. ""But, rather, you would want to address the root cause.” Matt Fitzgerald, a digital campaign strategist who has organized the efforts, said the campaigns were never intended to be the “end all be all."" He hopes they serve as an entry point for deeper commitments. While the previous two campaigns were about “a fist-bump, Mother Earth-style of environmentalism,” he said, this one seeks to center people while still “keeping the planet top of mind.” “No matter how big a mass internet mobilization moment might be, real progress on these issues demands people continuing to pay attention and continuing to stay involved,” Fitzgerald said. ""To me, the way you do that, is you reach people’s hearts before you try to convince them with their minds.” ___ Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.
