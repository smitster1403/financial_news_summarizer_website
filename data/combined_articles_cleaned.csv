Reduce Piramal Pharma; target of Rs 160: Choice Institutional Equities,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/reduce-piramal-pharma-target-of-rs-160-choice-institutional-equities-13799372.html,"Choice Institutional Equities's report on Piramal Pharma PIRPHARM continues to face pressure on overall financial performance and we expect these challenges to persist through FY26. The weakness is driven by inventory destocking by a key customer and operational constraint at the Lexington facility. We expect FY26 revenues to remain under pressure, with some recovery only from FY27. In line with the management guidance, we expect EBITDA margin to be ~8.5%, a sharp decline from ~15.8% in FY25. Tax rates remain volatile, reflecting losses in overseas CDMO operations. In light of these headwinds, we have revised our estimate downward by 2.0%/2.9% for FY26E/FY27E. Outlook Given the uncertainty around the CDMO order book and revenue visibility, we have also cut our valuation multiple by 10% and will continue to closely monitor performance over the next few quarters for signs of margin recovery and revenue stabilisation. Our revised TP is INR 160 (from INR 195), and we maintain our REDUCE rating.

"Swiggy falls 6% as Instamart reports wider sequential losses in Q3, CLSA downgrades stock",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/swiggy-falls-6-as-instamart-reports-wider-sequential-losses-in-q3-clsa-downgrades-stock-13799229.html,"Swiggy shares fell nearly 8 percent on Friday after its quick commerce arm Instamart reported wider sequential losses in the December quarter, while global brokerage CLSA downgraded the stock. Shares of Swiggy declined 7.78 percent to an intraday low of Rs 302.15 apiece on the NSE. The stock opened gap-down, slipping 5.69 percent in early trade, and extended losses thereafter. The decline came after three consecutive sessions of gains. Brokerage reactions to the quarterly performance were mixed. CLSA downgraded Swiggy to ‘Hold’ and cut its price target to Rs 335 after the company missed its revenue and Ebitda estimates for the third quarter. The brokerage said that while the food delivery business reported better growth in gross order value and revenues, with Ebitda broadly in line, the quick commerce segment disappointed across key metrics, reflecting slower growth and weaker profitability. Swiggy Q3 FY26: Strong growth, profitability still a challenge CLSA added that although the company has maintained its guidance for contribution breakeven, the path to achieving it now appears steeper. Ebitda losses at Instamart, the company’s quick commerce unit and its largest revenue generator, widened sequentially during the quarter, even as contribution and Ebitda margins showed some improvement. At the consolidated level, Swiggy reported a narrower sequential loss and reaffirmed its outlook for contribution margin breakeven by the first quarter of FY27. Jefferies said there remain several unanswered questions around the profitability trajectory of the quick commerce business and raised its estimates for Instamart’s losses going forward. Elara Capital described the third-quarter performance as a “mixed bag” but said it expects a sharper focus on profitability in the quick commerce segment, as management reiterated its contribution margin breakeven guidance. The stock is down 20.5 percent so far this year.

"Vedanta shares snap 6-day gains, fall 8% despite strong Q3 results on global decline in metal prices",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/vedanta-shares-snap-6-day-gains-fall-6-despite-strong-q3-results-on-global-decline-in-metal-prices-13799308.html,"The shares of metals-to-oil conglomerate Vedanta dropped more than 8 percent on January 30 after the company released its results for the third quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026. Brokerages have mixed views for the stock. The shares of the company dropped to Rs 702.4 apiece in the morning trading hours of Friday to snap a six-session gaining streak. This comes a day after the stock hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs 769.80 apiece. Notably, today’s sharp fall in Vedanta’s share price also comes amid a broader downturn in metal stocks, buoyed by profit booking, falling metal prices and speculation of a hawkish Federal Reserve Governor. The Nifty Metal index tumbled nearly 5 percent today. Vedanta Q3 Results: Vedanta on January 29 reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 5,710 crore for the October-December quarter of FY26, marking a 61 percent year-on-year (YoY) jump from the Rs 3,547 crore net profit reported in the same period of the previous financial year. The firm’s revenue from operations meanwhile rose 37 percent YoY to Rs 23,369 crore during the quarter under review. “Q3 FY26 has been a landmark quarter for Vedanta, delivering our highest-ever EBITDA of ₹15,171 crore, with two of our businesses achieving their best-ever financial results. Aluminium posted its strongest EBITDA margin of $1,268 per ton, supported by record alumina and aluminium production. Zinc India recorded its highest-ever quarterly EBITDA of ₹6,064 crore, driven by record mined and refined metal output, with silver contributing 44% of overall profit. Zinc International also reported a 28% YoY increase in production, led by Gamsberg achieving its highest-ever recovery,” said Arun Misra, Executive Director, Vedanta. “Our Oil & Gas business reached a major milestone with India’s first subsea template installation, while our Thermal Power Business delivered 188% YoY EBITDA growth with a 62% increase in sales volumes. Steel and Ferrochrome Business also achieved record production of steel billets at 285 kt, and ferrochrome output up 32% YoY,” he added. Brokerages on Vedanta: ICICI Direct Research said that Vedanta’s overall performance for the quarter was aided by higher aluminium, zinc and silver prices, but any cool-off in non-ferrous metal prices and silver could potentially led to stock price decline. Motilal Oswal Financial Services kept a ‘Neutral’ rating on the shares of Vedanta, with a target price of Rs 810 apiece. This implies an upside potential of nearly 6 percent from the stock’s previous closing price of Rs 766.35 apiece. The domestic brokerage said that Vedanta’s Q3 operational performance came largely as expected, supported by better volumes and favorable LME prices. “Capex plans are progressing well and will likely lead to further cost savings. Management targets to maintain strong growth in earnings, led by the upcoming capacity, which will produce higher VAP products. VEDL remains firm on its deleveraging plans, and going forward, higher cash flows will support both its expansion plans and deleveraging efforts,” it added. The stock currently trades at 7x EV/EBITDA and 4.4x P/BV on the FY27 estimate, Motilal said. Emkay Global kept a ‘Buy’ call on the stock, and increased its target price over 21 percent to Rs 850 apiece. The domestic brokerage said that the firm’s strong Q3 results were driven by higher aluminium and zinc profitability. “We continue to believe that if there was ever a better time in the past decade to own exposure to industrial metals, it is now,” it added.

"Hind Copper, NALCO, other metals stocks fall up to 10%; metal index tumbles 5%: Here's why",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/hind-copper-nalco-other-metals-stocks-drop-up-to-10-metal-index-snaps-3-day-gaining-streak-here-s-why-13799147.html,"The shares of metal companies tumbled in trade, pushing the Nifty Metal index down nearly 5 percent in the early trading hours of January 30. This comes amid profit booking after a sharp gaining streak, and decline in commodity prices. The Nifty Metal index tumbled nearly 5 percent to 11,855.85 on Friday, snapping a three-day gaining streak during which it gained nearly 9 percent. The sectoral index is currently the top loser on the market today. Why are metal stocks falling today? The fall in metal stocks may have been partially driven by profit booking after the rally. Additionally, metal prices significantly declined today. Gold and silver futures dropped around 6 percent each on the MCX, while Copper and aluminium futures with February expiries fell up to 4 percent in the morning trading hours. The sharp fall in global metal prices comes amid speculations that the US Federal Reserve may get a more hawkish chair. US President Donald Trump said he intends to announce his pick to replace Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Friday, as speculation intensifies over who will lead the American central bank after Jerome Powell steps aside in May. ""So, a potentially less dovish Fed Chairman pick, a rebound in the dollar and gold giving way to overbought conditions have contributed to the decline in the price of the precious metal,"" Reuters quoted KCM Chief Trade Analyst Tim Waterer as saying. Top metal losers today: Hindustan Copper shares dropped 10.5 percent to trade at Rs 680 apiece. This comes a day after the stock jumped 20 percent to hit a fresh lifetime high of Rs 760.05 apiece. National Aluminium Company (NALCO) shares fell around 10 percent. Vedanta shares dropped 8 percent, a day after the company released its results for the October-December quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026. The company reported a 60 percent year-on-year (YoY) jump in net profit to Rs 7,807 crore on strong base metal prices. Its net profit was Rs 4,876 crore in the year-ago period. The firm's revenue increased 19 percent to Rs 45,899 crore in Q3 FY26. Hindustan Zinc, which is the largest producer of silver in India, saw its share price decline by 7 percent.

"Gold, silver ETFs crash up to 14% as precious metals tumble from record highs: Should you buy?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/gold-silver-etfs-crash-up-to-14-as-precious-metals-tumble-from-record-highs-should-you-buy-13799082.html,"Gold and silver exchange traded funds (ETFs) declined in trade on January 30, as the prices of the precious metals plunged after a record rally. Gold futures with April expiry on MCX dropped around 5 percent to trade at Rs 1,75,100 per 10 grams. This comes a day after the contracts hit a fresh lifetime high of Rs 1,93,096 per 10 grams. The contracts with February and June expiries fell around 6 percent each in the early trading hours of Friday. Silver futures with March expiry meanwhile dropped around 6 percent to Rs 3,75,900 per kilogram. The contracts with May and July expiries also fell around 6 percent each. Gold and silver ETFs crash: Nippon India ETF Gold BeES, which has delivered a return of 104 percent over the past one year, dropped around 10 percent to trade at Rs 132 apiece. ICICI Prudential Gold ETF also plunged nearly 10 percent, while Axis Gold ETF fell around 9 percent. UTI Gold ETF, Edelweiss Gold, ETF, HDFC Gold ETF, Quantum Gold ETF, DSP Gold ETF and others also significantly dropped in trade. Among the silver ETFs, Mirae Asset Silver ETF fell around 13 percent, while Motilal Oswal Silver ETF dropped around 12.5 percent to Rs 330.01 apiece. HDFC Silver ETF and Nippon India Silver ETF meanwhile plunged more than 14 percent each. Aditya Birla Sun Life Silver ETF, Groww Silver ETF, ICICI Prudential Silver ETF, Axis Silver ETF, UTI Silver ETF, Tata Silver ETF, Kotak Silver ETF also declined sharply. Why are gold and silver prices crashing today? The sharp fall in global prices of the precious metals comes amid speculations that the US Federal Reserve may get a more hawkish chair. Spot gold fell 5 percent on Friday, a day after hitting a record high of $5,594.82. US President Donald Trump said he intends to announce his pick to replace Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Friday, as speculation intensifies over who will lead the American central bank after Jerome Powell steps aside in May. ""So, a potentially less dovish Fed Chairman pick, a rebound in the dollar and gold giving way to overbought conditions have contributed to the decline in the price of the precious metal,"" Reuters quoted KCM Chief Trade Analyst Tim Waterer as saying. ""Rumours that Kevin Warsh will replace Jerome Powell as Fed Chair has weighed on gold during Asian trade,"" said Matt Simpson, a senior analyst at StoneX, as quoted by the report. What should you do? The market is divided between those viewing corrections as buying opportunities and those warning of overheated conditions, said Tanvi Kanchan, Associate Director at Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers. She however added that despite price swings, fundamentals are compelling, driven by near-record industrial demand from solar panels, electric vehicles, and AI infrastructure. Kanchan however cautioned that after such explosive gains in 2025, timing a single entry point is “treacherous”. “Rather than deploying capital all at once, investors should consider spreading purchases over the coming weeks or months. This approach captures the dip while protecting against further corrections that could see silver test,” she said. For conservative investors, allocating 5-10 percent of portfolios to precious metals ETFs through systematic purchases reduces timing risk while maintaining exposure to an asset class that benefits from geopolitical instability and monetary policy uncertainty, according to the expert. With structural drivers such as central-bank accumulation, long-term demand and inflation hedging undiminished, disciplined investors may see this correction as a strategic accumulation zone, but should avoid aggressive short-term speculation given ongoing volatility, Khoo from VT Market said. Nirpendra Yadav, Senior Commodity Research Analyst at Bonanza, said that with global uncertainties, central bank gold accumulation, and expectations of softer real interest rates over the medium term, gold continues to play an important portfolio-hedging and diversification role.

About 1,717 shares declined against 1,205 advancing shares on the NSE. The market may see range-bound trading ahead of the Union Budget scheduled on February 1. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Jay Mehta, Technical Research at JM Financial Services NTPC | CMP: Rs 358.15 NTPC consolidated in a long-term wedge since April 2025. After breaking above the wedge, it traded sideways in a rectangular range. The latest session delivered a strong breakout above this range on robust positive volume, confirming buyer conviction. The price now trades above all key EMAs with upward slopes. The RSI holds support at 50 on both daily and weekly charts, supporting continued bullish momentum. The structure remains firmly bullish while support holds. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 375 Stop-Loss: Rs 335 Ipca Laboratories | CMP: Rs 1,479.7 Ipca Laboratories broke out from a prolonged triangular consolidation (from January 2–9, 2026), gaining 13.6 percent while broader indices fell around 2.5 percent, showing clear relative strength. The breakout was backed by strong volume. The stock is now retesting the breakout zone and formed a dragonfly doji on January 21, signalling throwback exhaustion. Support has been defended for the third time. Momentum indicators remain bullish and rising. The price is trading above short-, medium-, and long-term EMAs. Repeated support defence and relative strength point to a high-probability reversal. Adding more above Rs 1,525 could propel the bullish move. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,575, Rs 1,680 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,380 NMDC | CMP: Rs 84.6 NMDC broke out above a bullish inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on December 23 from Rs 78.6, rallying to Rs 86.72 before correcting. The pullback found support at the 100-day EMA and successfully retested the breakout zone. The latest bounce formed a strong three white soldiers pattern with rising positive volume, confirming accumulation. The price trades above all key EMAs with upward slopes. Momentum indicators align bullishly, and the structure favours buyers as long as the 100-day EMA holds. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 92, Rs 98 Stop-Loss: Rs 79 Om Mehra, Technical Research Analyst at Samco Securities Mishra Dhatu Nigam | CMP: Rs 387.5 Mishra Dhatu Nigam has shown a sharp pickup in momentum and is now attempting to break above a long-standing downward trendline on the daily chart. The stock has moved decisively higher and is trading above its short-term moving average, indicating improving strength. Volumes have remained stable alongside the rise in price. The daily RSI is placed near 66, highlighting strengthening momentum. The DMI setup shows the positive directional line above the negative line, while the ADX remains elevated, confirming improving trend strength. As long as the stock sustains above the Rs 360 zone, the near-term outlook remains positive. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 415 Stop-Loss: Rs 370 Bharat Petroleum Corporation | CMP: Rs 366.95 BPCL has bounced back from a triple bottom pattern after a corrective phase. The stock is now holding above the previous resistance zone and is attempting to move higher from the Rs 360–365 area. It is trading above its short- and medium-term moving averages and has reclaimed the mid-Bollinger band. The daily RSI is placed near the 55 level. The rate of change indicator remains in positive territory, supporting the ongoing recovery attempt. As long as BPCL holds above the Rs 355 support area, the near-term outlook remains steady. The stock is also respecting the rising VWAP (volume-weighted average price). Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 395 Stop-Loss: Rs 352 BSE | CMP: Rs 2,861.6 BSE has maintained its post-September recovery and is currently trading within a well-defined range on the daily chart. After a sharp advance from the September lows, the stock has spent the last several weeks consolidating between the Rs 2,650 and Rs 2,950 zones, with prices now positioned in the upper half of this range. The stock continues to trade above its 20-day average near Rs 2,750, indicating that short-term support remains intact. The daily RSI is placed near 60, reflecting steady momentum. The DMI setup shows the positive directional line above the negative line, while the ADX remains low. As long as the stock holds above Rs 2,750, the broader setup remains stable, with a directional move likely only on a decisive range breakout. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,080 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,770 Hitesh Tailor, Technical Research Analyst at Choice Broking Larsen & Toubro | CMP: Rs 3,932.9 Larsen & Toubro continues to exhibit a strong bullish structure in the longer-term trend. On the weekly chart, the stock is maintaining a clear higher high–higher low formation, confirming sustained trend strength. Recently, L&T delivered a breakout above its previous higher high. Post-breakout, the price retraced toward the 50-week EMA, where it found strong support and resumed its upward move, indicating healthy pullback buying and trend validation. The stock is trading comfortably above its 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-week EMAs, reinforcing the presence of a robust primary uptrend and positive medium-to-long-term sentiment. On the downside, Rs 3,800 acts as an important support zone, where accumulation activity is visible. The latest weekly candle has engulfed the previous range, reflecting renewed bullish dominance and improving momentum. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 4,270 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,730 Indus Towers | CMP: Rs 441.55 Indus Towers has recently delivered a decisive breakout from its prolonged sideways range, signalling the beginning of a fresh bullish phase. Post-breakout, the stock witnessed a healthy retest of the breakout zone, where it successfully took support aligned with the 50-day EMA and has since started moving higher, indicating strong follow-through buying and improving price structure. The stock is trading above its key 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-day EMAs, confirming a well-established uptrend and reinforcing positive short-to-medium-term sentiment. From the recent bottom, Indus Towers is forming a higher high and higher low structure, reflecting sustained demand and trend continuation. On the downside, Rs 425 remains an important support area, where accumulation activity is clearly visible. Momentum also supports the bullish view, with the RSI placed at 61.89, holding above the midline and turning higher, suggesting strengthening upside momentum. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 480 Stop-Loss: Rs 420 Axis Bank | CMP: Rs 1,363.9 Axis Bank is showing clear signs of strength after registering a decisive breakout above its previous higher high. The breakout is supported by strong volumes, indicating genuine buying interest and improved participation, which enhances the reliability of the move and signals bullish intent. On the weekly chart, the stock is trading comfortably above its key 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-week EMAs, confirming a well-established primary uptrend and strengthening medium-to-long-term sentiment. On the downside, the Rs 1,320–1,340 zone emerges as an important support area, aligned with the earlier higher-high breakout region, indicating a classic role reversal from resistance to support and providing a favourable risk-reward setup. Momentum indicators further support the bullish outlook, with the RSI placed at 69.36, reflecting a strong rising trend and sustained upside momentum without immediate signs of exhaustion. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,490 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,300",The stock is now holding above the previous resistance zone and is attempting to move higher from the Rs 360–365 area.,"Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 92, Rs 98 Stop-Loss: Rs 79 Om Mehra, Technical Research Analyst at Samco Securities Mishra Dhatu Nigam | CMP: Rs 387.5 Mishra Dhatu Nigam has shown a sharp pickup in momentum and is now attempting to break above a long-standing downward trendline on the daily chart.","The benchmark indices added 0.3 percent gains and maintained an uptrend for three consecutive sessions on January 29, but market breadth turned negative.","After a sharp advance from the September lows, the stock has spent the last several weeks consolidating between the Rs 2,650 and Rs 2,950 zones, with prices now positioned in the upper half of this range."

After a weak start, the market traded in a negative zone for the first half, while buying in the second half helped to regain in the losses to end near day's high. At close, the Sensex was up 221.69 points or 0.27 percent at 82,566.37, and the Nifty was up 76.15 points or 0.30 percent at 25,418.90.

Click to View More Outlook for January 30 Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets remained volatile but managed to edge higher amid mixed cues. After an initial downtick, the Nifty drifted lower in early trade; however, buying interest in heavyweight stocks across sectors helped pare losses and eventually pushed the index into positive territory. As a result, the benchmark settled near the 25,418 level, up by 0.30 percent. Sectoral trends were mixed, keeping participants engaged, with metals, energy and banking stocks edging higher, while FMCG, pharma and IT names remained under pressure. The broader market took a breather after two sessions of rebound and ended largely unchanged. Market sentiment stayed cautious as investors awaited key domestic events, including the Economic Survey and the upcoming Union Budget. Global uncertainty, mixed corporate earnings and continued foreign institutional selling weighed on risk appetite, while weakness in the Indian rupee added to the cautious undertone. That said, resilience in select heavyweight stocks helped limit the downside and enabled the index to sustain its recovery. The Nifty continues to hover around the long-term moving average, the 200 DEMA, with the ongoing tussle reflecting indecision at these levels. Having crossed the immediate hurdle around 25,350, the index now appears poised to inch towards the 25,600 zone. Strength in the banking index is playing a key role in the rebound, with other sectors providing support on a rotational basis. However, participants should avoid getting carried away by the recovery and remain selective, focusing on performing sectors and themes while keeping position sizes in check amid lingering geopolitical uncertainty and the approaching Union Budget. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities After initial weakness, the Nifty gained strength and closed higher. Overall, it maintained its position above the 50 EMA on the hourly chart. The RSI has remained in a positive crossover on the hourly timeframe. With Friday being the last trading session ahead of the Budget, a relatively contained movement can be expected. On the higher end, 25,500 is likely to act as a crucial resistance. On the lower end, immediate support is placed at 25,200, below which a sharp decline may be seen in the market. Abhinav Tiwari, Research Analyst at Bonanza Today, the Indian stock markets recovered strongly, after a volatile start. The Sensex ended 221 points higher at 82,566, while the Nifty 50 closed above 25,400. The recovery was driven by three key factors. First, the recently finalized India–EU FTA boosted market sentiment. Second, FIIs turned buyers after selling for 15 straight sessions, investing Rs. 480 crore in the cash market. DIIs continued to provide strong support, with inflows of Rs. 3,360 crore, helping stabilize the market. Third, the Economic Survey 2025-26 reassured investors about India’s macro strength. It projected GDP growth of 7.4% in FY26 and 7.2% in FY27, highlighted low inflation, improved bank asset quality, and continued government capital spending to support growth. Sector wise, metal stocks outperformed sharply, led by Hindustan Copper, supported by strong commodity prices and infrastructure demand expectations. In contrast, IT stocks declined, while FMCG and auto stocks saw mild profit booking. Looking ahead, markets may remain volatile until the Union Budget.

"Coal India, BCCL shares rise up to 5% as govt designates coking coal as critical mineral",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/coal-india-bccl-shares-rise-up-to-5-as-govt-designates-coking-coal-as-critical-mineral-13797237.html,"The shares of Coal India and Bharat Coking Coal sharply gained in trade on January 29 after the government designated coking coal as a 'Critical and Strategic Mineral' under the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957. The newly-listed shares of Bharat Coking Coal (BCCL) jumped nearly 5 percent to Rs 39 apiece in the afternoon trading hours of Thursday. Coal India shares meanwhile gained around 3 percent to Rs 456.95 apiece. Govt designates coking coal as critical mineral: The Ministry of Coal is a press statement said that the decision was taken on the basis of the recommendations of the High-Level Committee on Implementation of Viksit Bharat Goals (HLC-VB) and policy inputs from NITI Aayog, recognising the “strategic role of coking coal in ensuring mineral security and meeting the requirements of the domestic steel sector”. The ministry noted that India has approximately 37.37 billion tonnes of coking coal resources, largely located in Jharkhand, with additional reserves in Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal and Chhattisgarh. “Despite this domestic availability, imports of coking coal have increased from 51.20 million tonnes in 2020–21 to 57.58 million tonnes in 2024–25. Currently, around 95 % of the coking coal requirement of the steel sector is met through imports, leading to significant foreign exchange outgo,” it added. The inclusion of coking coal in the category will likely facilitate faster approvals, improve ease of doing business and accelerate exploration and mining activities, including of deep-seated deposits, the government said. “Mining of critical minerals is exempt from public consultation requirements and permits the utilisation of degraded forest land for compensatory afforestation, measures that are also expected to encourage greater private sector participation,” it added. The amendment is expected to reduce India’s import dependence, strengthen supply-chain resilience for the steel sector, and support the objectives of the National Steel Policy, according to the ministry. What the Economic Survey said about coal: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman tabled the Economic Survey in the Parliament earlier today. According to the survey, coal “remains crucial” as India has the fifth-largest coal reserves and is the second-largest consumer. Coal contributes 55 percent to the national energy mix and fuels over 74 percent of total power generation, it added. The survey noted that India’s coal industry reached historic heights in FY25, producing 1,047.52 million tonnes (MT) of coal. This marked a 4.98 percent year-on-year (YoY) increase from the Rs 997.83 MT. “This represents the highest coal production the country has ever achieved, demonstrating the industry's impressive growth and importance to India's energy needs,” it added. “Driven by this strong domestic output, imports registered a significant 7.9 per cent decline, falling from 264.53 MT in FY24 to 243.62 MT in FY25.15 Furthermore, the ratio of domestic production to consumption has also steadily improved over the past decade, as production growth has consistently outpaced consumption growth,” the Economic Survey further said. Additionally, the survey noted that India’s steel industry faces critical dependence on imported Coking Coal. “To mitigate global supply risks, the Ministry of Coal launched Mission Coking Coal in 2022 with a view to significantly enhance domestic raw coking coal production to 140 MT by 2030,” it said. Coal stocks: Coal India shares hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs 456.95 apiece today. The stock has gained around 8 percent in one week, and 14 percent in one month. Bharat Coking Coal shares made a stellar stock market debut on the exchanges earlier this month, listing with a premium of nearly 96 percent, following a massive subscription of 147 times between January 9-13 in the primary market. Shares of Bharat Coking Coal Ltd were listed at Rs 45 per share on the National Stock Exchange (NSE). The stock has so far declined around 13 percent since listing.

BEL shares decline up to 3% amid rich valuations despite strong Q3; profit booking pulls defence index 2% lower,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/bel-shares-decline-up-to-3-amid-rich-valuations-despite-strong-q3-profit-booking-pulls-defence-index-2-lower-13796838.html,"Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL) shares fell over 3 percent on Thursday amid profit booking, despite the company reporting strong December quarter results. The stock touched an intraday low of Rs 438.25. The defence PSU on Wednesday reported a 20.4 percent rise in consolidated net profit for the December quarter, while revenue from operations grew nearly 24 percent year-on-year. BEL shares have gained 36.3 per cent so far in 2025 and are up about 13 per cent in January. Brokerage firm CLSA maintained an ‘outperform’ rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 453, noting that third-quarter execution was better than expected. However, it said much of the optimism is already priced in, adding that near-term stock movement will depend on execution of the company’s large order backlog amid lumpy order inflows. Kotak Institutional Equities reiterated its ‘sell’ rating with a target price of Rs 390, citing limited upside after the recent rally and an unfavourable risk-reward profile at current levels. JP Morgan, which has an ‘overweight’ rating on BEL with a target price of Rs 556, said the company’s earnings beat estimates but cautioned that margins may normalise. It added that growth will hinge on operating leverage and timely execution of orders. BEL is a constituent of the benchmark Nifty 50 index. The sharp decline in the stock also weighed on other defence stocks. The Nifty Defence index, which had risen for two consecutive sessions, snapped its rally and fell up to 2 percent on Thursday amid profit booking. Defence stocks had rallied over the past two sessions after India and the European Union concluded a defence and security agreement aimed at enhancing cooperation in areas such as counter-terrorism, the Indo-Pacific and joint development of military hardware. The pact was finalised at the India-EU summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, along with European Council President Antonio Costa. Officials said the agreement is expected to improve interoperability in the defence sector and create opportunities for Indian companies under the EU’s Security Action for Europe programme.

Infrastructure projects delivered healthy execution internationally, while domestic execution was impacted by headwinds in central-funded water projects. Energy projects continued to see strong execution; however, cost overruns in select hydrocarbon projects weighed on margins, which are expected to remain soft over the next 2-3 quarters. In Hi-tech manufacturing, an execution ramp-up in Precision Engineering drove growth, while L&T’s participation in the 87 MALE drone procurement program with its technology partner, General Atomics, further strengthens its growth prospects. Management remains optimistic, supported by an anticipated pickup in private capex, an improving share of private-sector opportunities (~35% of domestic infrastructure prospects), and expansion into new verticals such as data centers, semiconductors, and electrolyzers, while reiterating its ~15% YoY revenue growth guidance and ~8.5% P&M margins for FY26.

"IT shares decline up to 3% on profit booking after 2-day rise, Persistent Systems, TCS, HCLTech lead losses; here are likely triggers",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/it-shares-decline-up-to-3-on-profit-booking-after-2-day-rise-persistent-systems-tcs-hcltech-lead-losses-here-are-likely-triggers-13796653.html,"IT shares declined up to 3 percent on Thursday after two sessions of gains, as investors booked profits across the sector. Stocks such as Persistent Systems, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and HCL Technologies led the losses amid selling pressure. The Nifty IT index, which had risen 1.2 percent over the previous two sessions, gave up those gains and fell 1.5 percent in trade. Key factors behind the decline 1) US Federal Reserve decision: The fall came after the US Federal Reserve held interest rates, in line with expectations, citing elevated inflation and resilient economic growth. Markets are not pricing in another rate cut until the June policy meeting. Higher US interest rates tend to support the dollar and Treasury yields, making emerging markets such as India relatively less attractive for foreign investors. ""The Fed decision is likely to lead to short-term challenges in US rate-sensitive sectors. Globally, this may lead to a slight market decline as investors adjust to the expectation of no immediate rate cuts,"" said Rajesh Palviya, Head of Research at Axis Securities. The Indian IT sector, valued at about USD 283 billion, derives a significant portion of its revenue from the United States, making developments in the world’s largest economy critical for the industry. 2) Profit booking: After the recent rally, profit booking was seen across IT stocks, leading the Nifty IT index to surrender all its gains from the past two sessions. Shares of TCS declined more than 2 percent, while Persistent Systems emerged as the biggest laggard, falling up to 3 percent. Wipro, Tech Mahindra, Infosys and HCL Technologies were down up to 1 percent. All ten constituents of the Nifty IT index were trading in the red. 3) Weak US dollar: The US dollar extended its losses this week, slipping to a four-year low against a basket of currencies. A weaker dollar can weigh on Indian IT companies as it reduces the value of dollar-denominated revenues when converted into rupees, impacting earnings visibility for export-oriented firms.

"Q3 Results impact: SBI Card, SBI Life shares fall 3%; Gland Pharma surges 9% to two-month high",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/q3-results-impact-sbi-cards-sbi-life-shares-fall-3-gland-pharma-surges-9-to-two-month-high-13796631.html,"The shares of SBI Card and SBI Life dropped more than 3 percent each on January 29 after their respective Q3 results failed to impress D-Street. Gland Pharma shares meanwhile rallied more than 9 percent. The three companies had released their results for the October-December quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026 earlier yesterday. SBI Card Q3 Results: SBI Cards and Payment Services shares dropped 3 percent to trade at a near one-year-low of Rs 758 apiece, nearing its 52-week low of Rs 721 apiece. The stock has now snapped a two-session gaining streak. The company reported a net profit of Rs 556.64 crore for the third quarter of FY26. This marked a 45 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise from the Rs 383.23 crore net profit reported in the same period of the previous financial year. The firm’s revenue from operations meanwhile rose more than 11 percent YoY to Rs 5,127.26 crore during the quarter under review. Motilal Oswal said that net interest margins fell 11 percent sequentially, as most of the benefit from the lower cost of funds has already been realized, while yields carry a mild near-term downside bias, which could keep margins under check. “We reduce our earnings estimates by 4%/6.5% for FY26/FY27, considering a contraction in margins and a decline in receivables, while credit costs are likely to witness a modest decline. We expect SBICARD to post an RoA/RoE of 3.85%/17.9% by FY27,” the domestic brokerage said. It reiterated its ‘Neutral’ rating on the stock, but revised its target price to Rs 875 apiece. This implies an upside potential of nearly 12 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. SBI Life Q3 Results: SBI Life Insurance Company also fell more than 3 percent to trade at a one-month low of Rs 1,984.20 apiece, snapping a two-session gaining streak. SBI Life Insurance Company reported a net profit of Rs 576.74 crore for Q3 FY26, marking a 5 percent YoY increase from the Rs 550.82 crore net profit reported in Q3 FY25. This however included a one-time exceptional item arising due to the new labour codes. Goldman Sachs maintained a ‘Buy’ call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 2,385 apiece. This implies an upside potential of more than 16 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. The international brokerage noted that the firm’s VNB rose 22 percent YoY, driven by improved product mix. It however noted that margin declined by 35 bps YoY due to ITC loss. Jefferies said that improvement in APE growth is encouraging, but markets expected a slight upgrade as company's reiterated growth guidance of 13-14 percent. Gland Pharma Q3 Results: Gland Pharma shares gained more than 9 percent to trade at Rs 1,847.10 apiece, the highest level seen by the stock since November 14 last year. The company reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 261.47 crore for Q3 FY26, marking a 28 percent year-on-year (YoY) increase from the Rs 204.69 crore net profit reported in Q3 FY25.

Ambit Capital, which has a ‘Sell’ rating on the stock with a price target of Rs 13,286, said margins are being weighed down by higher electric vehicle spending, new capacity-related costs and a shift towards lower-margin models. It added that the company’s volume-led strategy risks prioritising market share over profitability. Emkay Global, which has a ‘Buy’ rating on the stock, said it remains positive on Maruti Suzuki’s long-term prospects, citing its aggressive product pipeline and expectations of a recovery in small car demand after years of subdued growth. However, the brokerage cut its price target by 4.5 percent to Rs 17,000, citing rising commodity pressures. Auto index see profit booking The sharp fall in Maruti Suzuki shares weighed on the Nifty Auto index, which declined up to 2 percent during the session. TVS Motor Company, Mahindra & Mahindra, Maruti Suzuki India and Exide Industries were among the major laggards in the auto index, with losses of up to 3 percent. Auto shares also came under pressure following reports that India will sharply reduce import duties on high-end European cars, lowering rates to 30 percent from as much as 110 percent under a new trade agreement with the European Union. The move would significantly open India’s auto market, benefiting luxury manufacturers such as BMW and Mercedes-Benz. India and the EU concluded the trade agreement on Tuesday, which is set to reduce tariffs across a wide range of goods and strengthen bilateral trade.

"Hindustan Copper shares surge 20%, metal index gains for 3rd day: What's behind the rally?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/hindustan-copper-shares-surge-18-metal-index-gains-for-3rd-day-what-s-behind-the-rally-13796372.html,"Metal stocks extended their sharp surge for the third consecutive session on January 29, pushing the Nifty Metal index up more than 3 percent. Hindustan Copper shares were the top gainers on the index, jumping 20 percent to hit the upper circuit at an all-time high of Rs 760.05 apiece on Thursday. The stock has now rallied a whopping 314 percent in just nine months from its 52-week low of Rs 183.82 apiece, which it had hit in April this year. The Nifty Metal index rose to a record high of 12,498.60. This comes despite an overall bearish sentiment in markets, with benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty in the red. Why are Hindustan Copper shares rallying? Hindustan Copper shares have seen a sharp surge in recent days, rallying more than 42 percent in just three sessions so far after the company announced on January 24 that it has emerged as the preferred bidder for Baghwari-Khirkhori Copper and associated mineral block in Madhya Pradesh. The company had participated in the state government’s e-auction for the grant of mining lease and composite license for the said block. “Since, HCL had submitted the highest final price offer, it has been declared as the Preferred Bidder for this auction,” it said. The sharp surge in the shares of the Vedanta Group-company also comes amid the rally in copper prices, after the red metal gained 60 percent in 2025. Copper’s long-term fundamentals remain strong, and Indian investors increasingly seek global commodity exposure to help diversify their portfolios and use as hedges against inflation, said Ross Maxwell, Global Strategy Operations Lead, VT Markets. Why are metal stocks rising? Notably, gold and silver prices also jumped today, boosting the overall sentiment for metals. Gold futures with February expiry on the Multi Commodity Exchange of India (MCX) jumped 9 percent to hit an all-time high of Rs 1,80,779 per 10 grams. The contracts with April and June expiries also surged around 9 percent each to fresh lifetime highs. Silver futures with March expiry meanwhile gained around 6 percent to hit a fresh all-time high of Rs 4,07,456 per kilogram. The contracts with May and July expiries also jumped around 6 percent each to their respective lifetime highs. Meanwhile, the US Federal Reserve decided to leave rates unchanged on Wednesday, as widely expected. However, investors are actively looking forward to some boost for manufacturing in the upcoming Budget, which will likely in turn may push the metal stocks further up. Growth in the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) accelerated for the second straight month to a 26-month high of 7.8 percent on-year in December, compared with an upwardly revised 7.2 percent in November, driven by robust consumer demand, data released yesterday showed. On a sectoral basis, mining and electricity were drivers of higher IIP growth in December, while manufacturing growth moderated a little. Other metal stocks: National Aluminium Company (NALCO) gained around 6 percent, while Tata Steel, Vedanta and NMDC shares gained more than 4 percent each, as seen at 3.15 pm. Jindal Steel shares gained nearly 4 percent, while Hindalco Industries shares rose around 3 percent. JSW Steel shares jumped around 2 percent, while Steel Authority of India (SAIL), Hindustan Zinc and Adani Enterprises shares were up over 1 percent each. Jindal Stainless shares were trading in the green with marginal gains. Bucking the trend, APL Apollo Tubes and Welspun Corp shares fell up to 1 percent.

Buy Somany Ceramics; target of Rs 575: Choice Institutional Equities,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-somany-ceramics-target-of-rs-575-choice-institutional-equities-13796277.html,"Choice Institutional Equities's report on Somany Ceramics We maintain our ‘BUY’ rating on Somany Ceramics (SOMC) with a revised target price of INR 575/share. We factor in: 1) Volume CAGR of 7% over FY25–28E driven by market share gains from unorganised players in the Tiles segment, 2) Bathware segment revenue CAGR of 12% over FY25–28E, 3) Revenue contribution of 17%/12% from Projects/Bathware segments, respectively. Strong launches and sales in the Real Estate sector between FY22 and FY25 would help drive volume growth for SOMC over FY26–28E as these projects near completion, 4) EBITDA margin expansion of ~316 bps over FY25–28E. We forecast SOMC EBITDA/EPS CAGR of 20/44% over FY25–28E on the basis of our volume/realisation CAGR assumption of 7%/0.4% over the same period. We revise our 1-year forward target price for SOMC to INR 575/share (earlier INR 635/share). Our EPS estimate is reduced by 10.8% and 10.4% for FY26 and FY27E, respectively, primarily reflecting a 2% cut in the expected volume CAGR over FY25–FY28E. We value SOMC on our PEG ratio-based framework – we assign a PEG ratio of 0.9x on FY25–28E core EPS CAGR of 44%, which, we believe, is a conservative multiple. This valuation framework gives us the flexibility to assign a commensurate valuation multiple based on quantifiable earnings growth. Outlook We do a sanity check of our PEG ratio-based TP using implied EV/EBITDA, P/BV and P/E multiples. On our TP of INR 575, FY27E implied EVEBITDA/PB/PE multiples are 7.6x/2.4x/17.6x, all of which are reasonable in our view.

"Gold ETFs surge up to 13%, outperform silver ETFs as precious metals extend rally to record highs",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/gold-etfs-surge-up-to-13-outperform-silver-etfs-as-precious-metals-extend-rally-to-record-highs-13796240.html,"Gold and silver ETFs gained sharply on January 29, tracking the sharp rise in the precious metal. However, the yellow metal’s ETFs are currently outperforming those of silver after several sessions. Gold futures with February expiry on the Multi Commodity Exchange of India (MCX) jumped 9 percent to hit an all-time high of Rs 1,80,779 per 10 grams. The contracts with April and June expiries also surged around 9 percent each to fresh lifetime highs. Silver futures with March expiry meanwhile gained around 6 percent to hit a fresh all-time high of Rs 4,07,456 per kilogram. The contracts with May and July expiries also jumped around 6 percent each to their respective lifetime highs. Why are gold and silver prices surging today? ""Growing U.S. debt and uncertainty created by signs that the global trade system is splintering into regional blocs as opposed to a U.S.-centric model (are leading investors to pile into gold),"" Reuters quoted Marex analyst Edward Meir as saying. This comes after US President Donald Trump urged Iran to engage in negotiations and strike a deal on nuclear weapons. He warned that any future US attack would be far more severe than the one in 2025 when Iranian nuclear sites were struck. Tehran responded with a threat to strike back against the US, Israel and those who support them. Meanwhile, the US Federal Reserve decided to leave rates unchanged on Wednesday, as widely expected. the precious metal also drew support from crypto group 's plans to allocate 10–15 percent of its investment portfolio to physical gold. Gold, silver ETFs jump: Kotak Gold ETF surged more than 13 percent to hit a fresh all-time high of Rs 155 apiece, while Baroda BNP Paribas Gold ETF gained around 10 percent. Axis Gold ETF, 360 ONE Gold ETF, Union Gold ETF, LIC MF ETF and others gained around 9 percent each. Motilal Oswal Silver ETF meanwhile gained around 8 percent to hit a fresh lifetime high of Rs 371.91 apiece. Nippon India Silver ETF and few others also gained around 8 percent each in the morning. Gold vs silver: Motilal Oswal Financial Services in a recent note highlighted that silver has delivered an exceptional rally of over 200 percent in the past 12 months, sharply outperforming gold’s 80 percent rise during the same period. This made silver one of the strongest-performing assets globally. However, the domestic brokerage noted that this sharp outperformance of the white metal has led to a significant compression in the gold–silver ratio, which has fallen from pandemic highs of 127 to around 50 at the beginning of 2026. “This reset suggests that while the long-term outlook for precious metals remains constructive, the near-term risk-reward equation may now be shifting in favour of gold after silver’s outsized run,” Motilal said. “Silver has delivered sharp outperformance in a short span, and with the gold–silver ratio now near lower levels, the near-term risk-reward is turning more favourable for gold. While we remain positive on both metals and silver continues to have long-term upside backed by industrial demand and tight physical market conditions, the recent rally has also increased near-term volatility. In this phase, a higher allocation to gold can help manage fluctuations while staying invested in precious metals,” said Navneet Damani, Head of Research Commodities and Manav Modi, Commodities Analyst, Motilal Oswal Financial Services. However, the domestic brokerage emphasized that it does not have a negative view on silver. But, it suggests a risk-managed reallocation strategy after an aggressive up move. It added that silver has become more volatile with sharper price swings, while gold continues to offer relatively better stability—making it a preferred near-term hedge in uncertain market conditions. Despite the sharp surge in prices, global silver ETFs have seen outflows of over 3 million ounces since the start of 2026, while gold ETFs have witnessed comparatively steadier inflows, reflecting investor preference for more defensive positioning, Motilal added. Also read: Is it time to shift money from equities to precious metals? Here's what analysts say The brokerage advises investors a 75 percent allocation to gold and 25 percent to silver, indicating a preference for gold as a relatively steadier hedge in the current environment, while still retaining meaningful exposure to silver’s long-term structural upside. “Going forward, we believe investors can benefit from a rebalanced precious metals strategy—retaining silver as a long-term structural theme, while increasing gold allocation to manage near-term volatility and capture a potentially stronger risk-adjusted opportunity in the next phase of the cycle,” Damani said. Long-term investors may consider staggered allocation within asset allocation limits, while short-term traders should remain cautious amid continued volatility, said Aditya Agrawal, Chief Investment Officer at Avisa Wealth Creators.

"L&T shares jump 4% as brokerages stay bullish on long-term prospects post-Q3 results: Should you buy, sell or hold?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/l-t-shares-jump-4-as-brokerages-stay-bullish-on-long-term-prospects-post-q3-results-should-you-buy-sell-or-hold-13796129.html,"The shares of Larsen & Toubro (L&T) jumped around 4 percent on January 29 after the company released its results for the October-December quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026. Brokerages have increased their target prices for the stock, citing several reasons. The shares of the company rose to Rs 3,932.6 in the early trading hours of Thursday, extending gains for the third consecutive session. L&T Q3 Results: Larsen & Toubro (L&T) reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 3,215 crore for Q3 FY26, marking a 4 percent YoY fall from Rs 3,358.84 crore net profit reported in Q3 FY25. This however included a one-time exceptional cost of Rs 1,191 crore due to the implementation of new labour codes last year. Moneycontrol's poll of brokerages had estimated the firm’s net profit to rise to Rs 4,524 crore. The firm’s revenue from operations meanwhile rose 10.5 percent YoY to Rs 71,449.70 crore, missing MC poll estimate of Rs 75,011 crore. The Group’s consolidated order book as on December 31, 2025, stood at Rs 7,33,161 crore, reflecting a 30 percent YoY growth. International orders constituted 49 percent of the overall order book. Motilal Oswal on L&T: Motilal Oswal maintained a ‘Buy’ rating on the stock, while raising its target price for the stock to Rs 4,600 apiece from Rs 4,500 earlier. The latest target price implies an upside potential of more than 21 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. The domestic brokerage said that the firm’s consolidated Q3 earnings were slightly below its estimates due to weaker-than-expected execution for core E&C. Revenue growth for core E&C, which has remained weak for the last two quarters, is expected to ramp up from the fourth quarter. On the positive side, Motilal said that order inflows remained strong, driven by large order wins in domestic and international markets, providing healthy visibility for revenue. An improved prospect pipeline, further reduction in NWC and healthy RoE give comfort in an environment where domestic execution and margin performance in select segments were weak, it added. JM Financial on L&T: JM Financial maintained a ‘Buy’ rating on the stock, while raising its target price for the stock to Rs 4,655 apiece from Rs 4,500 earlier. The latest target price implies an upside potential of nearly 23 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. The domestic brokerage noted that the company yet again reported a strong delivery on order inflows, significantly exceeding estimates. “We estimate 24% FY26E order inflows (vs 10%+ guidance) factoring in Q3 strength and a robust international outlook. We expect the order inflow strength to sustain in FY27 (est 11% growth). We raise our FY28E core EBITDA by 3% factoring in stronger FY26 inflows,” it said. Nomura on L&T: Nomura maintained its ‘Buy’ call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 4,510 apiece. This implies an upside potential of nearly 19 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. The international brokerage noted that the company delivered robust order inflows, but execution missed estimates. It cut FY27–28 EBITDA estimates by 1-3 percent to factor in weaker energy segment margin. Jefferies on L&T: Jefferies maintained its ‘Buy’ call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 4,715 apiece. This implies an upside potential of more than 24 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. The international brokerage said that the firm’s Q3 EBITDA was 4 percent above estimates, and margin also improved. Potential discussions on semiconductor investments and Hyderabad Metro moving off books are positive triggers ahead, it added.

Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the Rs 183–181 zone with a stop-loss of Rs 175. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 195 in the short term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 195 Stop-Loss: Rs 175 Power Finance Corporation | CMP: Rs 383.05 PFC had been consolidating in a falling channel since the start of January before staging a decisive breakout, backed by a strong surge in volumes, indicating fresh buying interest. The RSI, which earlier struggled to sustain above the 60 mark, has now firmly moved past this level, signaling a clear pickup in bullish momentum. The DI+ crossing above DI– on the ADX indicator further confirms strengthening positive trend strength. Additionally, a fresh breakout in the Nifty PSE / Nifty ratio chart suggests potential near-term outperformance, positioning PFC as a likely leader within the sector. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the Rs 385–380 zone with a stop-loss of Rs 370. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 410 in the short term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 410 Stop-Loss: Rs 370","The trend appears to be strengthening again, and with a positive crossover in the daily RSI, the price may move higher in the coming sessions.","Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 330 Stop-Loss: Rs 278 Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical and Derivatives Research at SBI Securities Union Bank of India | CMP: Rs 181.93 Union Bank broke out above its major swing high zone of Rs 171–173 on January 14, supported by a clear rise in volumes, signaling a strong breakout.","On the lower end, support is placed at Rs 78.50; a break below this level may weaken sentiment.","On the higher end, the stock could move towards the Rs 87–90 zone in the short term."

Outlook for January 29 Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities After showing decent bounce back with high volatility on Tuesday, Nifty witnessed a sustainable follow-through up move on Wednesday and closed the day higher by 167 points. After opening on a positive note, the market showed volatility within a range for better part of the session. The sharp upside has emerged towards the end and Nifty closed higher. A reasonable bull candle has been formed on the daily chart with upper and lower shadow. Technically, this market action indicates continuation of Pre-Budget rally and the market is now placed at the edge of breaking above the crucial overhead resistance of 25450 levels. The overall chart pattern of Nifty indicates a formation of short-term bottom reversal for the market. A sustainable move above the hurdle of 25450-25500 levels could open broad based rally for the Nifty towards 25800 levels in the near term. Immediate support is placed at 25200 levels. Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical and Derivatives Research at SBI Securities Nifty opened on a strong note but quickly lost momentum, leading to range-bound trade for the major part of the day before sharp surge towards the last hour of the day led to Index closing 0.66% higher at 25,343. On the daily chart, the index has formed a bullish candle with a relatively long lower wick, indicating strong buying interest at lower levels. Despite the strong close above its 200-Day EMA, the Index has been hovering around this key level since last five sessions, underscoring persistent indecision and a tug-of-war between bulls and bears at this crucial long-term support. Going ahead, the key support for Nifty is placed in the 25,200–25,150 zone, which coincides with the 200-day EMA zone. A decisive breakdown below this zone could result in Nifty extending its weakness towards 24,900, followed by 24,600 in the near term. On the upside, the 25,450–25,500 zone is expected to act as an immediate resistance zone.

"BEL, BEML, other defence shares rise up to 12%, Nifty defence index soars 5%: Here are three likely reasons",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/bel-beml-other-defence-shares-rise-up-to-12-nifty-defence-index-soars-5-here-are-three-likely-reasons-13794883.html,"Defence shares advanced on Wednesday, with Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL), BEML rising up to 12 percent, driven by broad-based buying across the sector. The strong momentum pushed the Nifty India Defence index up by around 5 percent during the session. Key factors behind the sharp rise in defence shares 1) India-EU defence pact: India and the European Union on Tuesday concluded a defence and security agreement aimed at enhancing cooperation in areas such as counter-terrorism, the Indo-Pacific and joint development of military hardware. The pact was finalised at the India-EU summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and European Council President Antonio Costa. Officials said the agreement would improve interoperability in the defence sector and create opportunities for Indian companies to participate in the EU’s Security Action for Europe (SAFE) programme, supporting long-term growth prospects for domestic defence manufacturers. 2) Rub-off from BEL rally: Shares of BEL jumped 10 percent to a record high of Rs 457.50 after the firm reported a 20.4 percent year-on-year rise in consolidated net profit for the December quarter, while revenue from operations increased nearly 24 percent. BEL, which is also a constituent of the Nifty 50 index, saw heavy buying interest, triggering a spillover effect across other defence stocks. 3) Pre-Budget rally: The rally also comes ahead of the Union Budget scheduled for February 1. The Nifty India Defence index gained about 5 percent amid expectations that the government may announce a meaningful increase in capital expenditure for the defence sector, according to brokerage firms. The index extended gains for a second straight day and has risen more than 8 percent over the past two sessions.

Accumulate ABB India; target of Rs 5540: Prabhudas Lilladher,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/accumulate-abb-india-target-of-rs-5540-prabhudas-lilladher-2-13794377.html,"Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on ABB India ABB IN has announced its intention to divest its Robotics business, in line with the global parent’s divestment of ABB Robotics Schweiz AG (“ARSAG”) to SoftBank Group. As part of the divestment, ABB IN incorporated ABB Robotics India Private Limited (“INRBT”) as a wholly owned subsidiary and proposes to transfer its Robotics business to INRBT on a slump-sale basis for a consideration of Rs15.7bn. ABB IN then will sell its entire stake in INRBT to ARSAG. The transaction is expected to be completed by 27 February 2026. In our view, the deal is value-accretive for ABB IN, implied at ~2.2x EV/TTM sales and ~24.4x EV/TTM EBIT (inc. other income). The divestment is likely to sharpen the company’s focus on its core portfolio and support at least 10-15bps improvement in EBIT margins in CY26E and CY27E. Additionally, the exit should marginally enhance return ratios, driven by the elimination of negative net capital employed in the Robotics business. Outlook The stock is currently trading at a PE of 53.3x/45.9x on CY26/27E. We have a ‘Accumulate’ rating on the stock valuing it at a multiple of 56x Sep’27E (same as earlier) arriving at a TP of Rs5,540 (same as earlier).

Despite recent tax cuts, benign inflation and incremental gains in disposable income, paint demand has remained subdued indicating structural softness while intensifying competition is preventing any meaningful recovery for APNT We remain cautious on APNT due to. 1) sustained competitive intensity in decorative paints. 2) ~4-5% volume–value gap from an adverse mix (higher growth in Putty, Construction Chemicals and Waterproofing), limiting sales growth to mid-single-digit; and 3) sustained softness in Bath, Kitchen and Home Décor business.

"ONGC, Oil India shares jump up to 10% to new record highs as oil prices rise",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/ongc-oil-india-shares-jump-up-to-10-to-new-record-highs-as-oil-prices-rise-13794243.html,"The shares of state-run Oil & Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Oil India jumped up to 10 percent in trade on January 28, tracking the sharp rise in oil prices. This comes amid supply concerns after a severe winter storm disrupted US crude output and exports. Additionally, rising tensions in the Middle East also supported oil prices. Brent crude futures rose 33 cents to $67.90 a barrel, while WTI Crude futures gained 42 cents to trade at $62.81 per barrel, as seen at 11 am. The two stocks were among the top gainers on the Nifty Oil & Gas index, which was up more than 3 percent at 11,735.55. Why are oil prices rising? Oil extended gains as analysts estimated that US producers lost up to 2 million barrels per day or roughly 15 percent of national output over the weekend as the storm strained energy infrastructure and power grids. Crude and liquefied natural gas exports from U.S. Gulf Coast ports tumbled to zero on Sunday, Reuters quoted ship tracking service Vortexa as saying. The report added that Toshitaka Tazawa, an analyst at Fujitomi Securities, said that a loss of production in Kazakhstan is also underpinning the rally in oil prices. ""But once supply fears ease, selling pressure is likely to return,"" Tazawa added. He further said that an estimated global crude supply surplus this year amid geopolitical risks, including the Middle East tensions, could keep WTI trading around $60 a barrel for now. Tensions between US and Iran are also supporting oil prices. Reuters reported citing sources that a US aircraft carrier and supporting warships have arrived in the Middle East. This has raised the prospect of US President Donald Trump following through on his threat to attack Iran's senior leadership in response to the violent crackdown on nationwide protests, said ANZ analysts in a note. ONGC share price: ONGC shares jumped more than 7 percent to hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs 266.2 apiece. Earlier yesterday, ONGC announced that it entered into Ship Building Contracts (SBCs) with South Korea’s Samsung Heavy Industries for the construction of two state-of-the-art Very Large Ethane Carriers (VLEC). “ONGC and MOL Japan have set up two joint venture companies, Bharat Ethane One IFSC Pvt. Ltd. and Bharat Ethane Two IFSC Pvt. Ltd., in GIFT City, Gujarat, with each company owning and operating one VLEC. These vessels will support the transportation of about 600 KTPA of ethane for OPaL, a subsidiary of ONGC,” the company said in a press release. The VLECs will be Indian-flag, with a cargo capacity of one lakh cubic meters each, it added. ONGC shares have gained nearly 9 percent in the past five days, and more than 12 percent in the past one month.

Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director Amitabh Chaudhry said the bank’s ambition remains unchanged and it aims to outpace system growth in a sustainable manner. The gross non-performing assets ratio improved to 1.40 percent from 1.46 percent in the preceding quarter. Provisions increased to Rs 2,245.92 crore from Rs 2,155.63 crore in the year-ago period.

"Silver ETFs surge as precious metal rises 6%, but Hindustan Zinc shares fall 3%: Here's why",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/silver-etfs-surge-as-precious-metal-rises-6-but-hindustan-zinc-shares-fall-3-here-s-why-13794178.html,"The shares of Hindustan Zinc dropped more than 3 percent on January 28 even as silver prices surges, pushing silver ETFs to fresh lifetime highs. The shares of the Vedanta Group-company dropped to Rs 705.10 apiece in the early trading hours of Wednesday, snapping a two-session gaining streak. Why are Hindustan Zinc shares falling today? Hindustan Zinc shares are falling today after promoter Vedanta announced announced that its committee of directors has approved the plan to sell up to 6.7 crore equity shares, representing 1.59 percent stake in Hindustan Zinc, through an offer for sale (OFS). The floor price for the OFS has been set at Rs 685 apiece, marking a 6 percent discount from yesterday's closing price.

According to data on Hindustan Zinc’s latest shareholding pattern, promoter Vedanta held 61.84 percent stake in the company, as on December 31 last year.

"DCB Bank Q3 FY26: Earnings momentum builds, re-rating still has legs",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/moneycontrol-research/dcb-bank-q3-fy26-earnings-momentum-builds-re-rating-still-has-legs-13793999.html,"Highlights DCB Bank (CMP: Rs 198; Market cap: Rs 6,379 crore; Rating: Overweight) reported its highest-ever quarterly profit of Rs 185 crore in Q3 FY26, marking an increase of 23 percent YoY (year-on-year) despite one-off expense related to new labour code. The bank’s performance was broad-based, driven by healthy loan growth, robust fee income, better margins, improvement in operating efficiency, stronger asset quality, and contained credit costs. More encouragingly, the management expects margin expansion to continue through Q2 FY27, assuming no further rate cuts by the RBI. It has guided for a ROE (return on equity) of 13.5 percent in FY26 and 14.5 percent in FY27 — levels the bank has already effectively achieved in Q3 FY26. The reported ROA (return on asset) and the ROE for the quarter stood at 0.91 percent and 12.73 percent, respectively. However, excluding the one-off impact of the new labour code, the ROA would have been 1.01 percent and the ROE a healthy 14.1 percent in Q3 FY26, underscoring the underlying strength of profitability. DCB Bank’s stock has outperformed the sector benchmark (Bank Nifty) and overall market (Nifty) surging 46 percent and 70 percent in the past 6 months and 1 year respectively. The key question now is whether this rally can sustain. The most compelling aspect of DCB Bank is its valuation. Even after a sharp rally, the stock trades at only 0.9x its estimated FY27 book value, making it attractive. While a valuation re-rating hinges on the bank’s ability to sustain consistent performance, several profitability levers are in place that could drive further upside. Healthy business growth, robust fee income DCB Bank has maintained steady growth, with net advances rising to Rs 56,600 crore as of December 2025, reflecting a 18 percent YoY increase. DCB Bank aims to double its balance sheet over the next 3-3.5 years, targeting an annual loan growth of 18-22 percent. Mortgages constitute around 50 percent of the loan book as of September end. DCB’s deposits grew by 20 percent YoY till end December’25, higher than the banking system deposit growth, albeit on a smaller base. DCB’s CASA deposits ratio of 23 percent remains much lower compared to the banking system average. That said, it is reassuring to see the bank strengthening the granularity of its deposit base. Deposits from the top 20 depositors have come down to 6.61 percent of total deposits as of December 2025, compared to 15 percent in FY18, which adds stability to its funding profile. DCB Bank’s core fee income grew a strong 29 percent YoY, driven by robust traction in third-party distribution, trade finance, and processing fees. The management expects this momentum to sustain in Q4, which is seasonally strong for fee income. Over the medium term, the bank is confident of sustaining fee income at around 1 percent of average assets, broadly in line with the 1.1 percent achieved in Q3 FY26. Margin expansion to continue DCB’s net interest margin (NIM) came in at 3.27 percent in Q3 FY26, up 2 basis points YoY from the previous quarter (Q2 FY26). The management has guided to a gradual margin expansion from here onward till Q2 FY27, assuming the RBI doesn’t implement further rate cuts. The improvement is expected to play out over the next 3-4 quarters as the bank’s long-tenure fixed deposits will mature and get repriced at lower rates. In addition to lower funding costs, improved yields are expected to drive margin expansion. Over the past five years, DCB Bank has steadily built its home loan portfolio, which now accounts for nearly half of its mortgage book. Going forward, the bank aims to raise the share of business loans (LAP), which generate higher yields than home loans, while keeping the lower-margin co-lending portfolio capped at 15 percent of total advances. The bank had borrowings of more than Rs 8,000 crore as of March’25, which has declined to less than Rs 5,000 crore as the bank replaced it with relatively lower cost deposits. Together, the decline in funding costs and a more profitable product mix should support margin expansion. Operating efficiency improves DCB Bank effectively controlled its operating expenses aided by a reduction in employee base. Despite the one-off expense of Rs 27 crore in Q3 FY26, the cost-to-average assets ratio remained stable at 2.59 percent in Q3 FY26. Looking forward, the bank expects to benefit from the operating leverage as the balance sheet grows further. The management anticipates the cost-to-average-assets ratio to remain steady in the range of 2.5-2.6 percent and targets a cost-to-income ratio of 60 percent or below in the near term. Asset quality strengthens DCB Bank’s asset quality improved meaningfully in Q3 FY26, with a decline in both gross and net NPAs. More importantly, slippages fell to an 18-quarter low, signalling better asset quality trends. As a result, credit costs remained contained at just 37 bps—well below management’s guided 45 bps—even after accounting for floating provisions. The restructured book eased slightly but remains elevated at Rs 811 crore (1.4 percent of advances) as of December 2025 and needs to be monitored closely. View and Valuation Overall, DCB bank is poised for a healthy loan growth, margin expansion (assuming no further rate cut), stable cost-to-assets ratio, and a very low credit cost in near to medium term. This guidance is very encouraging and should drive healthy earnings growth in FY27 Despite the sharp rally post earnings, DCB Bank is trading at just 1 time FY27 estimated book value. The valuation can move above 1x forward BV on sectoral tailwinds which along with healthy earnings growth will drive a meaningful stock upside in the near to medium term. Long-term investors should buy the stock. Follow @nehadave01.

Asian Paints shares tumble 7% after 'lacklustre' Q3 results; brokerages expect delay in demand recovery,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/asian-paints-shares-tumble-7-after-lacklustre-q3-results-brokerages-expect-delay-in-demand-recovery-13794089.html,"The shares of Asian Paints tumbled nearly 7 percent on January 28 as brokerages analysed the company's results for the October-December quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026. The shares of the paint-maker dropped to Rs 2,451 apiece in the early trading hours of Wednesday. This is the lowest level seen by the stock since October last year. Asian Paints Q3 Results: Asian Paints on January 28 reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 1,060 crore for Q3 FY26, marking a 4.6 percent year-on-year (YoY) fall from Rs 1,110.48 crore net profit reported in Q3 FY25. This however includes exceptional items of Rs 157.61 crore due to labour code and Impairment loss following acquisition of Obgenix Software Private Limited ('White Teak'). The firm's revenue from operations meanwhile rose around 4 percent YoY to Rs 8,867.02 crore. Consolidated net sales increased 3.9 percent YoY to Rs 8,849.7 crore during the quarter under review. Motilal Oswal on Asian Paints: Motilal Oswal said that Asian Paints delivered a ""lacklustre performance"" as growth delivery remained soft despite a favorable base and multiple initiatives. ""A shorter festive period and an extended monsoon did weigh on 3Q performance and further delay demand recovery,"" the brokerage said. ""The management commentary on demand recovery was uninspiring, especially after the constructive commentary post-2QFY26. APNT expects volumes to be in the 8-10% range and value growth of ~5% in the near term. That said, management maintained its EBITDA margin guidance of 18-20%, aided by formulation and sourcing efficiencies. We model 10% revenue CAGR over FY26-28E along with ~19% EBITDA margin for FY27/FY28E,"" Motilal added. Given slower demand recovery and competitive pressure, Motilal expects the near-term growth outlook to remain muted. ""However, as the paint category enjoys pentup demand, we will be watchful if the recovery pace picks up faster in the coming seasonal quarters. The company is focusing on product innovation, brand salience, regionalization, and execution excellence to negate competitive pressure,"" it added. Motilal cut its EPS estimates by 1-3 percent over FY26-28E. It reiterated its ‘Neutral’ rating on the stock, with a target price of Rs 2,950 apiece, which implies an upside potential of nearly 12.5 percent over the stock's previous closing price. JM Financial on Asian Paints: JM Financial said that the company's Q3 results were marginally below expectation. ""Decorative volume/value growth of 7.9%/2.8% YoY was below ours and consensus estimate, despite weak base, owing to shorter festive (impacted October sales, November/December had better growth) and extended monsoons. Management remains cautious on demand trends – a) sees mid-single-digit sales growth as reasonable in near term led by volume growth of c.8-10% and negative price/mix impact of c.4-5% (similar to trends seen in 2Q/3Q), b) prolonged softness in industry growth seen due to some reduction in frequency of painting/occasion-led painting and consumer shift to other discretionary spends. Moreover, based on current trends the negative mix impact (c.4-5%) is likely to sustain for next few quarters (will percolate into FY27E),"" the brokerage said. It cut FY27/28E earnings estimate by 2-3 percent. JM Financial maintained its ‘Reduce’ call on the stock, while lowering its target price to Rs 2,735 apiece. This implies an upside potential of more than 4 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. CLSA on Asian Paints: CLSA kept an ‘Underperform’ call on the shares of Asian Paints, with a target price of Rs 1,875 apiece. This implies a downside potential of more than 28.5 percent over the stock’s previous closing price. The international brokerage said that the firm’s consolidated revenue growth was 2 percent below forecast, while standalone volume growth of 7.9 percent was in-line with an earlier festive season. It cut FY26-28 earnings estimate by 0-7 percent to account for persistence in gap between revenue and volume growth. HSBC on Asian Paints: HSBC downgraded the shares of Asian Paints to ‘Hold’, and cut its target price to Rs 2,900 per share. This implies an upside potential of nearly 11 percent over the previous closing price. The international brokerage said that the firm saw disappointing volume and revenue growth in Q3 FY26.

Bruised but Not Broken: These stocks are worth a bet amid the market weakness,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/moneycontrol-research/bruised-but-not-broken-stocks-worth-a-bet-amid-the-market-weakness-13793924.html,"Indian equity investors endured a bruising 2025, marked by heightened volatility and the weakest relative performance versus Asian peers in nearly three decades. Lacklustre corporate earnings, slowing consumption, higher valuations, adverse tariff outcomes, weakening currency, and heavy foreign outflows all weighed on Indian equities over the past year. While 2026 too has begun on a fragile note, rattled by global uncertainty and persistent foreign investor selling, there are emerging silver linings. Policy measures aimed at reviving domestic growth, including the biggest GST overhaul in eight years, tax cuts, and monetary easing, should help cushion the impact of global headwinds, particularly those arising from US tariff risks. Adding to the positives is the recent flurry of trade agreements, including the “mother of all deals” with the EU, which strengthens India’s medium-term growth outlook. Most importantly, the recent market correction has brought valuations to far more attractive levels. This valuation comfort, combined with policy support, sets the stage for a potential rebound in the market. Accordingly, we have identified a set of stocks that have borne the brunt of the sell-off. These fundamentally strong names are well placed for a swift rebound as sentiment improves, and are also relatively well protected on the downside should the market weakness persists.

LG Electronics India continues to dominate the consumer durables space with a best-in-class ROE of over 35 percent. The ongoing Rs 5,000-crore expansion and the recent price correction have created an attractive valuation gap versus peers such as Havells and Voltas, making this debt-free leader a compelling long-term growth play. Dixon Technologies dominates Indian EMS with more than a 50 percent mobile market share. Its strategic pivot into high-margin display modules and camera sub-assemblies, paired with recent price corrections, offers a rare value entry into this debt-free, ""Make in India"" titan. Among the largest manufacturer of aliphatic amines in India, Balaji Amines is an import substitution play.

Shadowfax Tech IPO: The weak market debut comes despite the IPO of Shadowfax Technologies closing with 1.68 times subscription during its three days of public bidding between January 20 and January 22. Retail individual investors (RII) and qualified institutional buyers (QIB) had booked their respective reserved portion more than 2 times, while non-institutional investors (NII) subscribed 54 percent of their allotted quota. Bengaluru-based technology-led logistics solutions provider Shadowfax Tech moved to the primary capital market to raise Rs 1,907.2 crore through its initial public offering (IPO), which comprised a fresh issue of shares worth Rs 1,000 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of shares worth Rs 907.2 crore by several investors including Flipkart, Eight Roads Investments, Qualcomm, and NewQuest Asia Fund. The price band for the IPO was set at Rs 118-124 per share. Investors could bid for a minimum of 120 shares, requiring an investment of Rs 14,160, and in multiples thereafter. How will the IPO proceeds be used? The company proposes to utilise proceeds from the fresh issue towards funding enhancing capacity in terms of network infrastructure, funding of lease payments for new first mile, last mile, and sort centres, as well as towards branding, marketing, and communication initiatives, unidentified inorganic acquisitions, and general corporate purposes. Shadowfax IPO anchor book: A day before the IPO opened for public bidding, Shadowfax announced that it has raised Rs 856.02 crore from 39 anchor investors on January 19. ""Out of the total allocation, 3.67 crore equity shares worth Rs 455.73 crore were allocated to nine domestic mutual funds including ICICI Prudential AMC, Nippon Life India, Motilal Oswal AMC, Bandhan Mutual Fund, HSBC MF, Helios MF, JM Financial MF, and Trust Mutual Fund,"" Shadowfax Technologies in its filing to exchanges said. ICICI Prudential AMC was the largest investor in the anchor book, acquiring 1.53 crore equity shares for Rs 190 crore through its four schemes - ICICI Prudential Flexicap Fund, ICICI Prudential Balanced Advantage Fund, ICICI Prudential Transportation and Logistics Fund, and ICICI Prudential Exports and Services Fund. Should you buy, sell or hold? Shadowfax is a technology-driven, asset-light logistics company focused on last-mile delivery, express parcels, reverse logistics and quick commerce services, said Mahesh M. Ojha, VP Research and Business Development at Kantilal Chhaganlal Securities. The company operates across more than 2,300 cities and 14,700 PIN codes and serves clients such as Flipkart, Meesho, Swiggy, Blinkit and Nykaa. The analyst highlighted that the IPO valuation appears relatively rich, when compared to peers like Delhivery. The business also faces intense competition and customer concentration risks, with a significant portion of revenue coming from a small number of large clients. According to him, the stock may be suitable for high-risk investors given the overall positive industry outlook. Investors with a long-term perspective who have already applied may consider holding the stock, while short-term investors could look to book gains on listing, if any. Fresh investors may wait for price discovery after listing. Gaurav Garg, Research Analyst at Lemonn Markets Desk, noted that Shadowfax offers a compelling play on India’s rapidly growing e-commerce and quick-commerce ecosystem. ""With pan-India reach across over 14,700 pincodes and a client roster that includes Flipkart, Meesho, Swiggy, Zomato, and Blinkit, the company has demonstrated strong revenue growth (~32% CAGR FY23–25) and operational scalability through its large gig-based delivery network. Its asset-light model and EBITDA-positive performance since FY24 highlight its improving profitability trajectory,"" the analyst said. He however cautioned that investors should be mindful of the risks and structural constraints. ""Margins remain thin, ROE and ROCE are modest, and revenue is concentrated with its top client contributing around 50%. At the upper price band, the IPO implies an EV/EBITDA of ~106x, which is rich compared with peers, suggesting that current valuations already reflect significant growth expectations,"" he said. Overall, Shadowfax offers long-term exposure to India’s logistics and hyperlocal delivery sector, but the IPO is better suited for investors with a long-term horizon, who are comfortable tracking execution, client diversification, and margin expansion over time, the analyst said. He added that for short-term listing gains, the risk-reward appears balanced but neutral.

Asian currencies gain as dollar weakens before Fed,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/asian-currencies-gain-as-dollar-weakens-before-fed-13793459.html,"Asian currencies gained as the dollar sank to levels last seen four years ago as investors turned cautious toward the world’s reserve currency amid unpredictable policymaking from Washington. The Malaysian ringgit, Thai baht and the South Korean won all appreciated in early Asian trading after the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index slid to its lowest since February 2022 during the US session. The dollar steadied after its biggest fall since April. The greenback’s decline had accelerated after President Donald Trump said he was not concerned about the weakening. Asian stocks were mixed with South Korea rising and Japan falling. US equity-index futures extended gains as the Wall Street Journal reported SoftBank is in talks to invest up to $30 billion more in OpenAI. The dollar’s weakness reflects uncertainty over policy from the Trump administration, including threats to take over Greenland and comments that have raised concerns about the Federal Reserve’s independence. That forms the backdrop as the Fed announces its interest-rate decision Wednesday, just as traders turn their attention to megacap technology earnings. “The Trump administration is taking a calculated risk,” said Win Thin, chief economist at Bank of Nassau 1982 Ltd. “Foreign exchange typically is the leader in terms of showing market discomfort with a country’s policies and economic outlook, so this dollar weakness bears watching.” The latest decline in the dollar also follows signs of US support to boost the yen, reopening speculation around the potential for coordinated currency intervention to guide the greenback lower against key trading partners. Reports from traders Friday indicated that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York contacted financial institutions to check on the yen’s exchange rate — a preliminary step that’s often taken before interventions. Meanwhile, Trump’s dollar comments added to an earlier slide in the greenback, which reflected a lack of confidence in the US economy partly due to his erratic tariff policy. Speaking to reporters in Iowa, Trump said “the dollar is doing great.” When asked if he wants to see the currency decline more, he replied that he could have it go up or down “like a yo-yo.” In other corners of the market, gold traded slightly below its record high and silver advanced. West Texas Intermediate crude also edged up. The commodities are all priced in dollars. Treasuries were a touch stronger with the yield on the 10-year falling one basis point to 4.23% ahead of Wednesday’s Fed meeting. The central bank is projected to halt its rate-cutting cycle as a steadier jobs market restores a degree of consensus among officials after months of growing division. With the economy still displaying exceptional strength, the Fed’s messaging is likely to emphasize a data‑driven approach to future policy decisions, according to Chris Brigati at SWBC. Also, the tone from this week’s earnings from the so-called ‘Magnificent Seven’ tech companies should be solid. Around a third of S&P 500 companies by market capitalization report results this week. Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc. and Tesla Inc. report earnings on Wednesday, followed by Apple Inc. on Thursday. Alphabet Inc., by far the best performer among megacaps last year, reports on Feb. 4. Results from Amazon.com Inc. land on Feb. 5 and Nvidia Corp.’s on Feb. 25. “This week is pivotal in setting the market’s near‑term tone as 2026 progresses,” Brigati noted. “History shows that a strong January often frames the narrative for the rest of the year, with investor psychology playing an outsized role.”",Around a third of S&P 500 companies by market capitalization report results this week.,"“The Trump administration is taking a calculated risk,” said Win Thin, chief economist at Bank of Nassau 1982 Ltd. “Foreign exchange typically is the leader in terms of showing market discomfort with a country’s policies and economic outlook, so this dollar weakness bears watching.” The latest decline in the dollar also follows signs of US support to boost the yen, reopening speculation around the potential for coordinated currency intervention to guide the greenback lower against key trading partners.",Around a third of S&P 500 companies by market capitalization report results this week.,"“The Trump administration is taking a calculated risk,” said Win Thin, chief economist at Bank of Nassau 1982 Ltd. “Foreign exchange typically is the leader in terms of showing market discomfort with a country’s policies and economic outlook, so this dollar weakness bears watching.” The latest decline in the dollar also follows signs of US support to boost the yen, reopening speculation around the potential for coordinated currency intervention to guide the greenback lower against key trading partners."

Budget 2026: Capital gains tax fears rattle markets as weak sentiment amplifies risk,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/budget-2026-capital-gains-tax-fears-rattle-markets-as-weak-sentiment-amplifies-risk-13793450.html,"As the Union Budget 2026 approaches, investors are growing increasingly nervous about the possibility of further changes to capital gains taxation at a time when equity markets are already fragile. The concern is not driven by any formal proposal, but by the broader market context: volatile equities, sustained foreign investor selling and lingering unease after tax hikes introduced in 2024. Market participants say even the perception that equity taxation could be pushed closer to marginal income tax rates is amplifying anxiety. The fear is less about a headline hike and more about structural shifts that could quietly alter behaviour. These include aligning equity gains with income-tax slabs, frequent changes to holding periods, or raising the burden on short-term trades without reviewing the securities transaction tax. This debate is unfolding against an already layered tax framework, where investors face capital gains tax, STT and currency depreciation pressures at the same time. 2024 Changes Still Casting a Shadow Budget 2024 raised long-term capital gains tax to 12.5 percent, removed indexation benefits for new investments and increased short-term capital gains tax to 20 percent. While markets initially absorbed the changes during a strong rally, corrections later in the year dragged sentiment lower and kept the Nifty largely range-bound through 2025. “When long-term capital gains were raised from 10 percent to 12.5 percent in July 2024, foreign investors were unhappy,” said Tushar Sachde, tax partner at PwC. “Will the government change rates again within a year? The consensus is that it is unlikely.” Still, with 2026 beginning on a volatile note and foreign portfolio investors continuing to sell, investors are reassessing whether the higher tax burden is beginning to bite at the wrong point in the cycle. “Foreign investors look at post-tax returns,” Sachde said. “With higher taxes and the rupee moving closer to 92, they’ve effectively been hit on both counts.” Risk of Sell-Off if Taxes Rise Further Tejas Khoday, Co- founder & CEO, FYERS, said the current framework has already stretched market participants. “The system has overshot for active traders,” he said. “Any hike from here could trigger a sharp sell-off because it disincentivises equity investors to stay invested, especially when markets are not delivering returns.” Market participants stress the issue is not whether equities should be taxed. They already are. The concern is about direction. After successive changes, investors are trying to assess whether the government sees the current regime as settled or as a step toward treating capital gains more like regular income. “Frequent tinkering creates instability,” Khoday said. “What markets need is long-term predictability.” Layered Taxes Add to Pressure Satwik Jain of Generational Capital pointed to the cumulative impact of overlapping levies. “STT was introduced in lieu of long-term capital gains. Now you have both,” he said. “Add currency depreciation to that, and post-tax returns get squeezed. Even a directional signal like reducing STT would be taken very positively.” Market participants argue layered taxation combined with currency weakness is hurting risk appetite, particularly for foreign investors and active domestic traders. Government’s Fiscal Limits From the government’s perspective, capital gains remain an important revenue source. A large share of gains accrue to higher-income investors, strengthening the argument that passive income should not enjoy large tax advantages over salaries. At the same time, welfare commitments and infrastructure spending leave limited room for large concessions. “There is limited fiscal headroom,” said PwC’s Sachde. “Any relief has to be weighed against revenue considerations.” However, experts warn that aggressive tax tightening could be counterproductive at a time when markets are central to household financialisation, IPO funding and the government’s own divestment plans. Incremental Tweaks More Likely Most market participants expect incremental changes rather than sweeping reform. These could include a review of STT, rationalisation between short- and long-term rates or structural simplification without raising headline taxes. “STT is almost unique to India. It taxes participation, not profits,” Khoday said. “If you want to widen participation, you need to reduce STT and avoid raising capital gains further.” There is also a growing call for policy stability. “Taxation has become a key issue for foreign investors,” Khoday said. “Most countries don’t tax portfolio investors the way India does. Any further increase becomes a deterrent when post-tax returns are already under pressure.” Trivesh D of Tradejini said even partial relief could help sentiment. “Simplification rather than tightening should be the focus. Reducing STT or easing short-term capital gains could improve risk appetite without distorting long-term investment behaviour.” Markets may have absorbed the 2024 changes, but patience is thinning. What investors want ahead of Budget 2026 is clarity, stability and fewer negative surprises.","As the Union Budget 2026 approaches, investors are growing increasingly nervous about the possibility of further changes to capital gains taxation at a time when equity markets are already fragile.","The consensus is that it is unlikely.” Still, with 2026 beginning on a volatile note and foreign portfolio investors continuing to sell, investors are reassessing whether the higher tax burden is beginning to bite at the wrong point in the cycle.","Even a directional signal like reducing STT would be taken very positively.” Market participants argue layered taxation combined with currency weakness is hurting risk appetite, particularly for foreign investors and active domestic traders.","The consensus is that it is unlikely.” Still, with 2026 beginning on a volatile note and foreign portfolio investors continuing to sell, investors are reassessing whether the higher tax burden is beginning to bite at the wrong point in the cycle."
"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade LIC, Indian Hotels, Asahi India Glass, JSW Steel, MCX India, and others on January 28?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-lic-indian-hotels-asahi-india-glass-jsw-steel-mcx-india-and-others-on-january-28-13793413.html,"The benchmark indices recouped some of the previous day’s losses, with the Nifty 50 rising half a percent on January 27, but market breadth remained weak. A total of 1,622 shares were under pressure compared to 1,311 shares that gained on the NSE. The market is expected to remain range-bound amid a rising India VIX. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Amol Athawale, VP Technical Research at Kotak Securities Indian Hotels Company | CMP: Rs 651.35 After the short-term correction in Indian Hotels from higher levels, the downward momentum has stalled and the stock has entered a consolidation phase over the past few sessions. Moreover, the stock is available near its important demand zone. The structure suggests a revival of the uptrend from the current levels in the near future. For traders, Rs 625 would be the key support level to watch. Above this, the uptrend structure could continue towards Rs 695. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 695 Stop-Loss: Rs 625 Tech Mahindra | CMP: Rs 1,745.1 On the weekly charts, Tech Mahindra is in a rising channel chart formation with a higher-high and higher-low series pattern. The stock has witnessed a steady recovery from trendline support levels. Additionally, the technical indicator RSI is indicating a further uptrend from the current levels, which could boost bullish momentum in the near future. For the next few trading sessions, Rs 1,680 could be the trend-decider level for the bulls. If the stock sustains above this level, a further uptrend towards Rs 1,870 can be expected. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,870 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,680 Life Insurance Corporation of India | CMP: Rs 807.8 On a broader timeframe, LIC has been in a prolonged downtrend and is currently in oversold territory. The texture of the chart formation and the technical indicator RSI indicate that the stock is very likely to rebound for a new leg of the upward move from its lower levels. For positional traders, Rs 780 would be the decisive level. Trading above this level, the uptrend formation will continue towards Rs 860. However, if the stock closes below Rs 780, traders may prefer to exit long positions. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 860 Stop-Loss: Rs 780 Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors Asahi India Glass | CMP: Rs 991.9 On the daily chart, Asahi India Glass has been consistently protecting the prior day’s low on a closing basis over the past four trading sessions, indicating strong buying interest emerging from lower levels. Additionally, prices have closed above the mid-Bollinger Bands, suggesting a shift in short-term momentum. With follow-up buying, a move towards the upper Bollinger Bands near the Rs 1,030 zone is expected. Along with this, the MACD has shown a bullish crossover below the zero line, reinforcing the positive outlook for the stock. For now, a sustained break above Rs 1,000 can extend the rise further towards Rs 1,030, followed by Rs 1,065 levels, while immediate support is placed around the Rs 960 level. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,030, Rs 1,065 Stop-Loss: Rs 960 JSW Steel | CMP: Rs 1,222 On the daily chart, JSW Steel has been trading in a broad consolidation range between Rs 1,150 and Rs 1,202 since early January 2026, indicating a phase of accumulation. In the previous session, the stock surged over 4 percent and decisively broke out of this range, also making a fresh record high near the Rs 1,230 level with a sharp rise in volumes, which is a strong bullish signal. Additionally, prices recently found support at the 20-day Exponential Moving Average and bounced higher, confirming improving momentum. For now, a buy-on-dips strategy can be adopted for upside targets of Rs 1,280–1,300 levels. On the downside, Rs 1,170, which is an EMA support, should remain protected. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,280, Rs 1,300 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,170 Aditya Thukral, Founder & Analyst of AT Research & Risk Managers Multi Commodity Exchange of India | CMP: Rs 2,418 A falling trendline breakout has been witnessed in MCX with rising volumes. The stock is consistently trading above all its major exponential moving averages, namely the 20-day, 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day EMAs. An imminent uptrend has been established with the formation of higher highs and higher lows across all timeframes. Now that prices are trading above the short-term resistance of Rs 2,400, an uptrend continuation can be expected. Any minor dip towards the support at Rs 2,400 should be considered a buying opportunity, as previous resistance has turned into support. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,550 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,299 Infosys | CMP: Rs 1,682.7 Infosys has been consolidating within a box pattern formed since December 22, 2025. Now that corrections in the stock are shrinking and an uptrend in prices is still very fresh, a breakout above the resistance at Rs 1,694 could provide a decent upward move. The stock is consistently trading above all its major exponential moving averages—20-day, 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day—with all the EMAs sloping upwards. A breakout above Rs 1,694 would be a continuation of the established uptrend and would provide an opportunity for fresh long positions.

Click to View More Outlook for January 28 Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical and Derivatives Research at SBI Securities On monthly expiry, Nifty experienced a choppy session for the major part of the day before last hour short covering surge. The 25,190–25,200 zone, which acted as a support in the previous session, acted as a strong resistance for the major part of the session before Index managed to close higher. On the daily chart, Nifty formed a sizeable bullish candle with long lower wicks, indicating buying interest at lower levels. Notably, the index has managed to close above the 200-day EMA zone. Going ahead, the key support for Nifty is placed in the 24,950–24,900 zone, which coincides with the upward-sloping trendline, drawn by connecting the swing lows of 24,338 (8th August) and 24,405 (29th August). A decisive breakdown below this zone could result in Nifty extending its weakness towards 24,700, followed by 24,500 in the near term. On the upside, the 25,250–25,300 zone is expected to act as a strong resistance area, limiting any pullback attempts. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The NSE monthly expiry day proved to be a roller-coaster session for the market, as the Nifty witnessed a 300-point swing during the day. On closing, the index ended above the 200-DMA; however, a follow-up move is required before changing the bearish view on the Nifty. Support remains at 24,900, and a slip below this level could unlock fresh selling pressure from the bears. On the higher end, 25,500 continues to be a crucial resistance zone. Until the Nifty decisively breaks above 25,500, a sell-on-rise strategy may continue to work in the market.
