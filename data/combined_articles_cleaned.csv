South Korea's top court upholds acquittal of Samsung's Lee over contentious 2015 merger,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/south-koreas-top-court-upholds-acquittal-of-samsungs-lee-over-contentious-2015-merger-2025-07-16/,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s top court Thursday upheld the acquittal of Samsung Electronics Chairman Lee Jae-yong on financial criminal charges, ending years of legal disputes over the 2015 merger between Samsung affiliates that solidified his control over the company. In 2024, the Seoul Central District Court acquitted Lee of charges like stock price manipulation and accounting fraud by ruling that prosecutors failed to sufficiently prove the merger was unlawfully conducted with an aim to strengthen Lee’s control over Samsung. The Seoul High Court upheld the district court's ruling in February, and the Supreme Court dismissed prosecutors' appeal of the high court's decision Thursday. Its ruling is final and cannot be appealed. Samsung’s lawyers said in a statement that they “sincerely thank” the Supreme Court for “wisely"" ruling on the case. They said the ruling confirmed the 2015 merger was legitimate. Lee, a third-generation corporate heir who was officially appointed chairman of Samsung Electronics in 2022, has led the Samsung group of companies since 2014, when his late father, Lee Kun-hee, suffered a heart attack. The senior Lee died in 2020. Lee Jae-yong served 18 months in prison after being convicted in 2017 on separate bribery charges related to the 2015 merger. He was originally sentenced to five years in prison for offering bribes to then-President Park Geun-hye and her close confidante to win government support for the merger, which was key to strengthening his control over the Samsung business empire and solidifying the father-to-son leadership succession. Lee was paroled in 2021 and pardoned by then-President Yoon Suk Yeol in 2022. Some shareholders opposed the 2015 merger, saying it unfairly benefited the Lee family while hurting minority shareholders.","SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s top court Thursday upheld the acquittal of Samsung Electronics Chairman Lee Jae-yong on financial criminal charges, ending years of legal disputes over the 2015 merger between Samsung affiliates that solidified his control over the company.","SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s top court Thursday upheld the acquittal of Samsung Electronics Chairman Lee Jae-yong on financial criminal charges, ending years of legal disputes over the 2015 merger between Samsung affiliates that solidified his control over the company.","In 2024, the Seoul Central District Court acquitted Lee of charges like stock price manipulation and accounting fraud by ruling that prosecutors failed to sufficiently prove the merger was unlawfully conducted with an aim to strengthen Lee’s control over Samsung.","He was originally sentenced to five years in prison for offering bribes to then-President Park Geun-hye and her close confidante to win government support for the merger, which was key to strengthening his control over the Samsung business empire and solidifying the father-to-son leadership succession."
Republican senators caution Trump against firing Fed chair Jerome Powell,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/republican-senators-caution-trump-against-firing-fed-chair-jerome-powell-2025-07-16/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is gaining some key backing on Capitol Hill from GOP senators who fear the repercussions if President Donald Trump follows through with threats to try and remove the politically independent central banker. As Trump seemingly waffled back and forth this week on trying to dismiss the Fed chair, some Republicans in Congress began to speak up and warn that such a move would be a mistake. Trump would potentially obliterate the Fed’s independence from political influence and inject uncertainty into the foundations of the U.S. economy if he fires Powell. “If anybody thinks it would be a good idea for the Fed to become another agency in the government subject to the president, they’re making a huge mistake,” GOP North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis said in a floor speech. The measure of support from GOP members of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs showed how traditional Republicans are carefully navigating a presidency in which Trump often flirts with ideas — like steep tariffs or firing the Fed chair — that threaten to undermine confidence in the U.S. economy. Tillis, who recently decided not to seek reelection after clashing with Trump, later told The Associated Press that the economic fallout from Powell's firing would mostly hurt “little guys like me that grew up in trailer parks that may have a few thousand dollars in a 401k.” He also pointed out that the underlying complaint that Trump has with the Fed — its reluctance to cut interest rates — is not controlled by Powell alone, but instead a 12-member committee. “The markets expect an independent, central bank,” said GOP South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds, who cautioned against firing Powell. “And if they thought for a minute that he wasn’t independent, it would cast a spell over the forecasts and the integrity of the decisions being made by the bank.” Still, plenty of other Republicans think that dismissing Powell is a fine idea. “The most incompetent, worst Federal Reserve chairman in American history should resign,” said GOP Ohio Sen. Bernie Moreno. Trump said he was also encouraged to fire Powell during a meeting with about a dozen far-right House members Tuesday evening. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told reporters that he was “unhappy with the leadership"" at the Fed, but added “I’m honestly not sure whether that executive authority exists” to fire Powell. House Financial Services Committee chair French Hill has underscored that presidents don’t have the authority to fire the Fed chair, yet has also been sympathetic to Trump’s complaints about Powell’s leadership. He and other Republicans have also noted that Powell’s term as chair is ending next year anyway, and Trump will have an opportunity to name a new chair then. When Congress started the Federal Reserve over 100 years ago, it insulated it from political pressure by stipulating that its governors and chair could only be fired “for cause” — a higher bar than most political appointees. However, the Trump administration has maneuvered to meet that standard by accusing Powell of mishandling a $2.5 billion renovation project at the Fed's headquarters. “When his initial attempts to bully Powell failed, Trump and Republicans in Congress suddenly decided to look into how much the Fed is spending on building renovations,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, said in a speech Wednesday. “Independence does not mean impunity and I have long pushed for more transparency and accountability at the Fed. But give me a break.” After Powell sent Congress a letter detailing parts of the renovation project, Sen. Tim Scott, the Senate Banking Committee chair, released a short statement saying Scott “has continued to call for increased transparency and accountability at the Federal Reserve, and this letter is consistent with improving the communication and transparency he is seeking.” Regardless, it would be legally dubious to fire Powell over the renovation. ""That would be litigated and I don’t see a reason, for cause or otherwise, to remove him,” Sen. John Kennedy, a Republican member of the Senate committee that oversees the Fed, told reporters this week. He added that he understood the president's “frustration” with the Fed's reluctance to lower interest rates as it tries to tamp down inflation, saying, “I get that, but I think it’s very important the Federal Reserve remains independent.” Even those Republicans who argued that the president has grounds to fire Powell and piled criticism on the central banker conceded that it would still be a painful step. “That’s a decision the president will make, and he’s being very deliberate about it,"" said Moreno, the Ohio senator who called for Powell's resignation. “But I don’t think we should put the country through any of that.""","WOODINVILLE, Wash.

"Families, kids most at risk of losing HUD housing with Trump’s proposed time limits",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/families-kids-most-at-risk-of-losing-hud-housing-with-trumps-proposed-time-limits-2025-07-16/,"WOODINVILLE, Wash. (AP) — More than 1 million low-income households — most of them working families with children — who depend on the nation’s public housing and Section 8 voucher programs could be at risk of losing their government-subsidized homes under the Trump administration’s proposal to impose a two-year time limit on rental assistance. That’s according to new research from New York University, obtained exclusively by The Associated Press, which suggests the time restriction could affect as many as 1.4 million households helped by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The NYU report also raises concerns about the largely untested policy, as most of the limited number of local housing authorities that have voluntarily tried the idea eventually abandoned the pilots. “If currently assisted households are subject to a two-year limit, that would lead to enormous disruption and large administrative costs,"" for public housing authorities, the report said, adding that once the limit was up, housing authorities ""would have to evict all of these households and identify new households to replace them.” Amid a worsening national affordable housing and homelessness crisis, President Donald Trump’s administration is determined to reshape HUD’s expansive role providing stable housing for low-income people, which has been at the heart of its mission for generations. At a June congressional budget hearing, HUD Secretary Scott Turner argued reforms like time limits will fix waste and fraud in public housing and Section 8 voucher programs while motivating low-income families to work toward self-sufficiency. “It’s broken and deviated from its original purpose, which is to temporarily help Americans in need,” Turner said. “HUD assistance is not supposed to be permanent.” Elderly and disabled people would be exempted, but there’s little guidance from the agency on how time-limited housing assistance would be implemented — how it would be enforced, when the clock starts and how the exemptions would be defined. The NYU researchers dove deep into HUD’s nationwide data over a 10-year period, analyzing nearly 4.9 million households that have been public housing and Section 8 voucher tenants. Of that, about 2.1 million could be affected by the time limits because they include at least one adult who is not elderly or disabled and about 70% of those households had already been living on those subsidies for two or more years. HUD spokesperson Kasey Lovett pushed back on the NYU study. “There is plenty of data that strongly supports time limits and shows that long-term government assistance without any incentive disincentivizes able-bodied Americans to work,” Lovett said in a statement. The time limits could displace more than a million children, as it would largely punish families who are working but still earning far below their area’s median income. “Housing assistance is especially impactful for children,” said Claudia Aiken, the director of new research partnerships for the Housing Solutions Lab at NYU's Furman Center who co-authored the study with Ellie Lochhead. Their health, education, employment and earnings potential can “change in really meaningful ways if they have stable housing,” Aiken said. Havalah Hopkins, a 33-year-old single mom, has been living in a public housing unit outside of Seattle since 2022, but now fears a two-year time limit would leave her and her teenage son homeless. The 14-year-old boy has autism but is considered high-functioning, so how HUD defines disabled and “able-bodied” for the time limit could determine if their family will be affected by the restriction. Hopkins, who does catering work for a local chain restaurant, pays $450 a month in rent — 30% of her household income — for their two-bedroom apartment in Woodinville, Washington. Asked what she likes most about her home, Hopkins said: “I like that I can afford it.” Of the 17 housing authorities that tried time limits, 11 discontinued the trial. None tried two-year limits — the most common policy was a five-year limit with the option for an extra two and the limits usually applied to specific programs or referrals. Although there are over 3,000 housing authorities in the country, only 139 of them have ever been granted flexibility to consider testing a time limit while using federal funds for programs such as job training and financial counseling. “Any conversation about time limits ends up being this really nuanced, hyper-local focus on what works for specific communities rather than this broad national-level implementation,” said Jim Crawford, director of the Moving to Work Collaborative which oversees that group of housing authorities. Even with those supports, several housing authorities said rent was still too high and well-paying jobs were scarce, according to the study. Others said they didn’t have enough capacity to provide enough supportive services to help households afford rent. Shawnté Spears of the Housing Authority of the County of San Mateo in California said the agency's five-year time limits have “given folks motivation” to meet their goals in tandem with self-sufficiency programs funded by dollars Trump wants to cut. Time limits also give more households the chance to use vouchers, she said. But with the Bay Area’s high rents, some tenants still have to spend more than half of their income on rent once their time is up or end up back on waitlists. “I believe the program is very helpful in getting folks prepared but there lies this really, really significant rent burden here in our county,” said Spears. “When folks do leave our time-limited program, they are facing an uphill battle.” ___ Kramon reported from Atlanta. ___ Kramon is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

1.4M of the nation's poorest renters risk losing their homes with Trump's proposed HUD time limit,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/14m-of-the-nations-poorest-renters-risk-losing-their-homes-with-trumps-proposed-hud-time-limit-2025-07-16/,"WOODINVILLE, Wash. (AP) — Havalah Hopkins rarely says no to the chain restaurant catering gigs that send her out to Seattle-area events — from church potlucks to office lunches and graduation parties. The delivery fees and tips she earns on top of $18 an hour mean it’s better than minimum-wage shift work, even though it’s not consistent. It helps her afford the government-subsidized apartment she and her 14-year-old autistic son have lived in for three years, though it’s still tough to make ends meet. “It’s a cycle of feeling defeated and depleted, no matter how much energy and effort and tenacity you have towards surviving,” Hopkins said. Still, the 33-year-old single mother is grateful she has stable housing — experts estimate just 1 in 4 low-income households eligible for U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development rental assistance get the benefits. And now Hopkins is at risk of losing her home, as federal officials move to restrict HUD policy. Amid a worsening national affordable housing and homelessness crisis, President Donald Trump’s administration is determined to reshape HUD's expansive role providing stable housing for low-income people, which has been at the heart of its mission for generations. The proposed changes include a two-year limit on the federal government’s signature rental assistance programs. At a June congressional budget hearing, HUD Secretary Scott Turner argued policies like time limits will fix waste and fraud in public housing and Section 8 voucher programs. “It’s broken and deviated from its original purpose, which is to temporarily help Americans in need,” Turner said. “HUD assistance is not supposed to be permanent.” But the move to restrict such key subsidies would mark a significant retreat from the scope of HUD's work. Millions of tenants moved in with the promise of subsidized housing for as long as they were poor enough to remain qualified, so time limits would be a seismic shift that could destabilize the most vulnerable households, many unlikely to ever afford today’s record-high rents. New research from New York University, obtained exclusively by The Associated Press, found that if families were cut off after two years, 1.4 million households could lose their vouchers and public housing subsidies — largely working families with children. This would lead housing authorities to evict many families, the report said. A broad time limit would cause “substantial disruption and dislocation,” the it said, noting the policy is largely untested and most of the few housing authorities to voluntarily try it eventually abandoned the pilots. A break from HUD's long-held purpose of helping house the poor could also jeopardize its contracts with private landlords, who say they're already feeling the uncertainty as public housing authorities from Seattle to Atlanta announce they're scaling back in anticipation of federal funding cuts. Critics fear the restriction could derail those working towards self-sufficiency — defeating the goal time-limit supporters hope to achieve. HUD spokesperson Kasey Lovett pushed back on the NYU study. “There is plenty of data that strongly supports time limits and shows that long-term government assistance without any incentive disincentivizes able-bodied Americans to work,” Lovett said in a statement. She primarily cited statistics suggesting low employment among HUD-subsidized tenants. Hopkins said the policy would likely leave her and her son homeless in an economy that often feels indifferent to working poor people like her. “A two-year time limit is ridiculous,” she said. “It’s so disrespectful. I think it’s dehumanizing — the whole system.” Researchers from the Housing Solutions Lab at New York University’s Furman Center analyzed HUD’s data over a 10-year period and found about 70% of households who could be affected by a two-year limit had already been living on those subsidies for two or more years. That’s based on 2024 estimates and doesn’t include elderly and disabled people who wouldn't be subject to time limits. Exempted households make up about half of the roughly 4.9 million households getting rental assistance. In the first study to examine the proposed policy’s possible impacts, the NYU researchers found time limits would largely punish families who are working but earning far below their area’s median income, which would ultimately shift federal rental assistance away from households with kids. “Housing assistance is especially impactful for children,” said Claudia Aiken, the study co-author and director of new research partnerships for the Housing Solutions Lab. Their health, education, employment and earnings potential can ""change in really meaningful ways if they have stable housing,” she said. It would affect people like Hopkins, whose family was on a years-long waitlist in the expensive region where she grew up. In July 2022, she and her son moved into a two-bedroom public housing unit in Woodinville, Washington. She pays $450 a month in rent — 30% of her household income. A market-rate apartment in the area costs at least $2,000 more, according to the King County Housing Authority, which in June announced it would pause issuing some new vouchers. Hopkins knows she could never afford to live in her home state without rental assistance. It was a relief they could stay as long as they needed. She had been struggling to scrape together hundreds of dollars more a month for her previous trailer home. “There’s no words to put on feeling like your housing is secure,” Hopkins said. “I feel like I was gasping for air and I’m finally able to breathe.” She credits the housing subsidy for her ability to finally leave an abusive marriage, and still dreams of more — perhaps her own catering business or working as a party decorator. “We all can’t be lawyers and doctors — and two years isn’t enough to even become that,” Hopkins said. Since learning of Trump’s proposal, Hopkins said she's been haunted by thoughts of shoving her possessions into a van with her son, upending the stability she built for him. The average household in HUD-subsidized housing stays about six years, studies show. HUD funds local public housing projects where nearly 1 million households live and the Section 8 vouchers that about 4 million households use to offset their private rentals. There’s been little guidance from HUD on how time-limited housing assistance would be implemented — how it would be enforced, when the clock starts and how the exemptions would be defined. Both Democrats and Republicans have acknowledged the potential for time limits to help curb HUD’s notorious waitlists. Hard-liners contend the threat of housing loss will push people to reach self-sufficiency; others see limits, when coupled with support and workforce incentives, as a means to motivate tenants to improve their lives. Yet there are strikingly few successful examples. NYU researchers identified just 17 public housing authorities that have tested time limits. None of the programs were designed for only two years and 11 abandoned the restriction — despite being able to use federal dollars for services to help people achieve self-sufficiency. Several agencies that dropped the limits said tenants still struggled to afford housing after their time was up. “These policies are complex and difficult to monitor, enforce, and do well,” NYU's Aiken said. The city of Keene, New Hampshire, tried five-year time limits starting in 2001, but terminated the policy before fully enforcing it to avoid kicking out households that would still be “rent burdened, or potentially homeless,” said Josh Meehan, executive director of Keene Housing. In California, Shawnté Spears of the Housing Authority of San Mateo County said the agency has kept its five-year time limit in tandem with educational programs she says have “given folks motivation” to meet their goals. It also gives more people the chance to use vouchers, she said. NYU's Aiken acknowledged HUD's long waitlists make the current system “a bit of a lottery,"" adding: ""You could say that time limits are a way of increasing people’s odds in that lottery.” HUD's Section 8 programs have long depended on hundreds of thousands of for-profit and nonprofit small business owners and property managers to accept tenant vouchers. Now, landlords fear a two-year limit could put their contracts for HUD-subsidized housing in limbo. Amid the uncertainty, Denise Muha, executive director of the National Leased Housing Association, said multiple landlord groups have voiced their concerns about HUD's next budget in a letter to congressional leaders. She said landlords generally agree two years is simply not enough time for most low-income tenants to change their fortunes. “As a practical matter, you’re going to increase your turnover, which is a cost,"" Muha said. “Nobody wants to throw out their tenants without cause.” It’s always been a significant lift for private landlords to work with HUD subsidies, which involve burdensome paperwork, heavy oversight and maintenance inspections. But the trade-off is a near guarantee of dependable longer-term renters and rental income. If that’s compromised, some landlords say they’d pull back from the federal subsidy programs. Brad Suster, who owns 86 Chicago-area units funded by HUD, said accepting subsidies could become risky. “Would we have the same reliability that we know has traditionally come for countless years from the federal government?” Suster said. “That’s something landlords and owners want to know is there."" The diminishing housing stock available to low-income tenants has been a brewing problem for HUD. Between 2010 and 2020, some 50,000 housing providers left the voucher program, the agency has reported. It's up for debate whether lawmakers will buy into Trump's vision for HUD. This week the U.S. House appropriations committee is taking up HUD's 2026 budget, which so far makes no mention of time limits. HUD's Lovett noted the Senate’s budget plans for the agency have not yet been released, and said the administration remains focused on future implementation of time limits. “HUD will continue to engage with colleagues on the hill to ensure a seamless transition and enforcement of any new time limit,” Lovett said in a statement. Noëlle Porter, the director of government affairs at the National Housing Law Project, said Trump’s fight for time limits is far from over, noting that legislative and rule changes could make them a reality. “It is clearly a stated goal of the administration to impose work requirements and time limits on rental assistance, even though it would be wildly unpopular,” Porter said. Democratic Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina says there's no evidence time limits would save HUD money. “This doesn’t help families who already are working multiple jobs to become self-sufficient,” Clyburn said at a June hearing. “Instead, it creates chaos, financial uncertainty and pushes these families into more severe trade-offs.” Time limits could imperil Aaliyah Barnes' longtime dream of graduating college and becoming a nurse, finding a job and a home she can afford. The 28-year-old single mom in Louisville, Kentucky, this year joined Family Scholar House, which provides counseling and support for people pursuing an education — and, to Barnes’ relief, housing. Her apartment is paid for by a Section 8 voucher. In March, Barnes moved in and her 3-year-old son, Aarmoni, finally got his own room, where she set up a learning wall. Previously, she had struggled to afford housing on her wages at a call center — and living with her mom, two sisters and their kids in a cramped house was an environment ridden with arguments. The stable future she’s building could disappear, though, if she's forced out in two years when her schooling is expected to take three years. “I’d be so close, but so far away,” Barnes said. ___ Kramon reported from Atlanta. ___ Kramon is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

"Leaders of the UK and Germany to sign a treaty on defense, trade and migration",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/leaders-of-the-uk-and-germany-to-sign-a-treaty-on-defense-trade-and-migration-2025-07-16/,"LONDON (AP) — U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz are set to sign a treaty on Thursday pledging to tighten defense ties and step up law-enforcement cooperation against gangs that smuggle migrants across the English Channel. The center-right German leader is in London on his first official visit to Britain since taking office in May. Starmer visited Berlin in August 2024, announcing plans for the U.K.-Germany “friendship and cooperation” treaty with Merz’s predecessor, Olaf Scholz. A priority for Starmer, who heads the center-left Labour Party, is curbing the gangs behind cross-channel people smuggling. About 37,000 people were detected crossing the English Channel from France in small boats in 2024, and more than 20,000 people made the crossing in the first six months of 2025. Dozens of people have died trying to cross. Berlin agreed last year to make facilitating the smuggling of migrants to the U.K. a criminal offence, a move that will give law enforcements more powers to investigate the supply and storage of small boats to be used for the crossings. Merz is expected to commit to adopting the law change by the end of the year. “Chancellor Merz’s commitment to make necessary changes to German law to disrupt the supply lines of the dangerous vessels which carry illegal migrants across the Channel is hugely welcome,” Starmer said, calling the U.K. and Germany “the closest of allies.” Germany and the U.K. – Europe’s largest and second-largest economies – are also expected to announce a series of investment deals. The treaty builds on a defense pact the U.K. and Germany, two of the biggest European supporters of Ukraine, signed last year pledging closer co-operation against a growing threat from Russia. It includes a promise to come to one another’s aid in case of attack. The two leaders also are expected to agree Thursday to joint export campaigns for jointly produced equipment such as Boxer armored vehicles and Typhoon jets, and to develop a deep precision strike missile in the next decade. Starmer has worked to improve relations with Britain’s neighbors, strained by the U.K.’s acrimonious departure from the European Union in 2020. He has sought to rebuild ties strained by years of ill-tempered wrangling over Brexit terms. He has ruled out rejoining the 27-nation bloc’s single market or customs union, and has been cool to the idea of a youth mobility agreement with the EU, but has sought to reduce trade barriers and to strengthen defense cooperation. “I make no secret of the fact I very much regret to this day that Britain left the European Union,” Merz told the German parliament last week. “But if they at least work together with us again in the area of foreign and security policy, then that is a very good sign.

Inside the high-stakes battle to win a New York City casino license,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/inside-the-high-stakes-battle-to-win-a-new-york-city-casino-license-2025-07-16/,"NEW YORK (AP) — A Caesars Palace casino in the heart of Times Square. A sprawling gambling hall along Coney Island’s iconic boardwalk. A Hard Rock casino complex next to the home stadium of baseball’s New York Mets. Eight projects are bidding for a state license to operate a casino in the lucrative New York City market, each dangling the prospect of generational investment in America’s largest metropolitan region. But one — a Bally's casino proposed on a Bronx golf course once run by President Donald Trump’s company — may have already run out of luck, after city lawmakers denied it a key approval this week. All of the proposed casinos, in application materials submitted in recent days, promise to create thousands of new jobs, flashy new community amenities in the form of hotels, shops, restaurants and entertainment venues and billions of dollars a year in taxable gambling revenues for the state’s coffers. How realistic those promises are, though, is an open question, given the proliferation of casinos in the northeast and the explosion of online gambling in recent years, casino experts say. The arrival of full-fledged casino resorts in New York City has been years in the making. The gambling industry spent mightily to secure approval from New York voters in a referendum authorizing the licensing of up to seven full casinos with live table games back in 2013. But the state initially allowed upstate venues a head start. The state's Gaming Commission says it hopes to finally award up to three downstate licenses in December. But before then, community advisory committees appointed by lawmakers and local officials will weigh community opinions of each plan. Nearly all the casino proposals face some degree of local push back. On Monday, the New York City Council denied Bally's a needed rezoning change following local resident concerns about the environmental impact of its $4 billion proposal, which also calls for a 500-room hotel and a 2,000-seat event center. Bally’s, which bought the former Trump Links course in 2023, had promised to pay Trump another $115 million if it were to secure a casino license, though that was not among the objections voiced by the Democratic majority on the council nor the Republican lawmaker representing the Bronx district. Spokespersons for Bally’s declined to comment on the future of the project this week. Not surprisingly, the debate over the proposed Times Square casino has taken center stage, with supporters and opponents recently holding dueling rallies in the Crossroads of the World. Among the prominent groups opposed to the $5.4 billion plan is the Broadway League, a trade group representing America’s performing arts theaters. It says a casino would draw patrons away from neighborhood businesses and threaten a theater industry still reeling from the COVID-19 pandemic. The project's backers have countered that the plan, which calls for renovating a skyscraper that currently houses the Minskoff Theatre, home of long-running “The Lion King” musical, will actually boost demand for Broadway tickets. The developers, which have also enlisted Jay-Z’s Roc Nation to curate their entertainment offerings, promise $250 million in community projects, including a public safety plan designed by former NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton and a multimillion-dollar civil rights museum that helped earn an endorsement from the Rev. Al Sharpton. The two other casinos proposed in Manhattan — one for its West Side and another on its East Side — could face similar headwinds, given their proximity to residential neighborhoods, according to casino experts. But the proposed West Side resort, near the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center and the Lincoln Tunnel to New Jersey, could reel in business travelers and convention attendees, if it can win over locals, said Soojin Ha, a lecturer at Cornell University’s business school. Meanwhile in Brooklyn, organizers of the quirky Mermaid Parade are among those leading the charge against a Coney Island casino, arguing the plan would remove large chunks of the boardwalk’s iconic amusement rides and block access to the public beach. Since the 2013 referendum, four full casinos have opened in New York, though all of them are located upstate, miles away from Manhattan. The state also has nine gambling halls offering slot machines and other electronic gambling machines but no live table games. Some three hours drive north of Manhattan are the Native American tribe-owned Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods casinos in Connecticut. Two hours south are the New Jersey shore casinos of Atlantic City, and less than two hours due west in Pennsylvania is the tribe-owned Wind Creek Casino at the former site of Bethlehem Steel. Despite the competition from seemingly all corners, New York City’s dense market could sustain three gambling halls, depending on where they’re located, suggests John Holden, a business professor at Indiana University who specializes in gambling law. “We typically see fairly rosy revenue projections put out by the gaming industry, but the New York City market is really without comparison,” he said. The state could hedge its bets by awarding two of the three licenses to proven winners: the racinos -- slot parlors built alongside horse racing tracks — that have been successfully operating for years in the New York City area, said Alan Woinski, a New Jersey-based gambling consultant. MGM Resorts is proposing a $2.3 billion expansion of the Empire City Casino at Yonkers Raceway. Resorts World, owned by Malaysian casino giant Genting, is proposing a $5.5 billion investment to its gaming facility at the Aqueduct Racetrack in Queens. Those expansions, Woinski noted, could be rolled out in a matter of months, meaning the state wouldn’t have to wait years for the construction of a wholly new site to start reaping the financial windfall. ___ Follow Philip Marcelo at https://x.com/philmarcelo Before you consider Empire, you'll want to hear this.",It also comes as rail project leaders are seeking private investment to help pay for its estimated price tag of more than $100 billion.,"Democratic Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan said at a budget hearing earlier this year that her constituents “overwhelmingly believe” high-speed rail spending “has been irresponsible.” Newsom plans to extend the state's cap-and-trade program, a key funding source for the project which is set to expire at the end of 2030, through 2045.",State officials are now focused on building a 119-mile (192-kilometer) stretch connecting the Central Valley cities of Bakersfield and Merced that is set to be operating by 2033.,"""This project was Severely Overpriced, Overregulated, and NEVER DELIVERED.” The loss marks the latest blow to California by the Trump administration, which has blocked a first-in-the-nation rule to phase out the sale of new gas-powered cars, launched investigations into university admission policies and threatened to pull funding over transgender girls being allowed to compete in girls sports."
Trump administration pulls $4B in federal funding for California's bullet train project,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-administration-pulls-4b-in-federal-funding-for-californias-bullet-train-project-2025-07-16/,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — The Trump administration revoked federal funding for California's high-speed rail project on Wednesday, intensifying uncertainty about how the state will make good on its long-delayed promise of building a bullet train to shuttle riders between San Francisco and Los Angeles. The U.S. Transportation Department announced it was pulling back $4 billion in funding for the project, weeks after signaling it would do so. Overall, a little less than a quarter of the project's funding has come from the federal government. The rest has come from the state, mainly through a voter-approved bond and money from its cap-and-trade program. President Donald Trump and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy both have slammed the project as a “train to nowhere."" “The Railroad we were promised still does not exist, and never will,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social. ""This project was Severely Overpriced, Overregulated, and NEVER DELIVERED.” The loss marks the latest blow to California by the Trump administration, which has blocked a first-in-the-nation rule to phase out the sale of new gas-powered cars, launched investigations into university admission policies and threatened to pull funding over transgender girls being allowed to compete in girls sports. It also comes as rail project leaders are seeking private investment to help pay for its estimated price tag of more than $100 billion. Voters first approved the project in 2008 and it was supposed to be operating this decade. But cost estimates have consistently grown and its timeline pushed back. State officials are now focused on building a 119-mile (192-kilometer) stretch connecting the Central Valley cities of Bakersfield and Merced that is set to be operating by 2033. The California High Speed Rail Authority is slated to release a report this summer to state lawmakers with an updated funding plan and timeline for the project. Authority officials wrote in a letter earlier this month that the Trump administration made up its mind about revoking funding before thoroughly reviewing the project. They noted that more than 50 structures have already been built, including underpasses, viaducts and bridges to separate the rail line from roadways for safety. “Canceling these grants without cause isn’t just wrong — it’s illegal,” authority CEO Ian Choudri said in a statement Wednesday. “These are legally binding agreements, and the Authority has met every obligation, as confirmed by repeated federal reviews, as recently as February 2025."" The authority has asked potential private investors to express their interest by the end of the month. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said the state will keep “all options on the table” to fight the revocation of federal funds. “Trump wants to hand China the future and abandon the Central Valley. We won’t let him,"" he said in a statement. The state has “no viable plan” to complete even the Central Valley segment, said Drew Feeley, acting administrator of the transportation department's Federal Railroad Administration, in a report released last month. He called the project a “story of broken promises” and a waste of taxpayer dollars. California Democrats also have criticized project spending. Democratic Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan said at a budget hearing earlier this year that her constituents “overwhelmingly believe” high-speed rail spending “has been irresponsible.” Newsom plans to extend the state's cap-and-trade program, a key funding source for the project which is set to expire at the end of 2030, through 2045. The program sets a declining limit on the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions large emitters can release. Those polluters can buy allowances from the state needed to pollute, and about 45% of that money goes into what's known as the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, according to the Independent Emissions Market Advisory Committee, a group of experts that reviews the program. The fund helps pay for climate and transportation projects, including high-speed rail. The bullet train project receives 25% of the money from the fund, which ends up being a little less or a little more than $1 billion annually, depending on the year. Newsom in May proposed guaranteeing $1 billion a year for the project from the fund, but lawmakers have not agreed to that. ___ Austin is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

The initial offer, made last year, was for 2,200 yen ($14.86) per share in cash. In the letter, sent to media Thursday and signed by its two top executives, including founder Alain Bouchard, Couche-Tard expressed exasperation at the response it was getting from Seven & i despite repeated attempts at dialogue. “We have been very patient and respectful throughout this process, beginning with our meeting on July 23, 2024,” the letter said. “You have engaged in a calculated campaign of obfuscation and delay, to the great detriment of 7 & i and its shareholders. We believe this approach reinforces our concerns about your approach to governance. Based on this persistent lack of good faith engagement, we are withdrawing our proposal.” Couche-Tard, which runs nearly 17,000 stores in more than 30 countries and territories, including the U.S., said the documents it got lacked key information, executives were no-shows at meetings, and the meetings it did have ended up being “readouts” of statements, not frank discussions. Seven & i acknowledged the dropped offer Thursday and said it considered talks “in good faith and constructively.” “We remain fully committed to our standalone value creation plan, which we have been pursing in parallel, and to unlocking the value of our businesses, including our North American convenience store business. Our plan is concrete and actionable,” it said in a statement. Some analysts say Seven & i management has not fully leveraged the business’ global potential or delivered enough value to shareholders, and could use better marketing, although its bottom line is unlikely to be affected by U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff policies. The 7-Eleven franchise, which spans more than 85,000 stores in Japan, the U.S. and Europe, has a new chief executive, Stephen Hayes Dacus, the first foreigner tapped to head 7-Eleven. Dacus, an American whose mother is Japanese, has promised a leaner business by focusing on the supply chain and tailoring shop offerings to various regions. For the first quarter of this fiscal year, Seven & i reported a doubling in profits to 49 billion yen ($330 million), mainly due to previously announced sales of property and equipment at its Ito-Yokado Co. retail chain. Quarterly sales held up, as a favorable exchange rate helped some overseas earnings, according to the Tokyo-based chain. The seemingly omnipresent 7-Eleven chain speckles the streets of Japan, offering everything from stationery items and rice balls to hot coffee and utility bill payments. ___ Yuri Kageyama is on Threads: https://www.threads.com/@yurikageyama","“Instead of simply shifting those harmful impacts to another area, TVA should scrap its plans for a new gas plant altogether and invest in clean and cost-effective power options, like solar power and battery storage,” said Trey Bussey, a staff attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center.","Rich last week posted a map showing many areas of farmland around the preferred area, saying it “CANNOT happen.” Rollins, the agriculture secretary, replied, “ON IT” and “Standby.” Rich additionally has called for a “complete revamping” of TVA, saying, “Cheatham County ain't the only place they're doing this.” Any final decision on the plant would need to await the installation of more TVA board members.","Clean energy advocates applauded TVA’s decision to back off the Cheatham County location, but said it should instead invest more in clean energy options and heed the concern of communities where similar gas plants are proposed in Cumberland City, Kingston and Memphis.","Rich last week posted a map showing many areas of farmland around the preferred area, saying it “CANNOT happen.” Rollins, the agriculture secretary, replied, “ON IT” and “Standby.” Rich additionally has called for a “complete revamping” of TVA, saying, “Cheatham County ain't the only place they're doing this.” Any final decision on the plant would need to await the installation of more TVA board members."
Federal utility backs off Tennessee gas plant site after John Rich says he enlisted Trump's help,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/federal-utility-backs-off-tennessee-gas-plant-site-after-john-rich-says-he-enlisted-trumps-help-2025-07-16/,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — The nation's largest public utility says it is looking at other sites for a new natural gas power plant after its preferred location in Tennessee drew heavy public scrutiny, including from country musician John Rich. The Tennessee Valley Authority announced Tuesday that the Cheatham County site is no longer its preferred one. Rich, a conservative supporter of President Donald Trump who has Cheatham County roots, has been a key opponent of TVA's 900-megawatt plant in the county. He said he enlisted Trump to team up on the issue. A TVA spokesperson declined to comment about Rich’s comments, including whether Trump was involved. A White House spokesperson also declined to comment. The community has raised concerns about the potential impact on water quality, air quality, noise pollution, safety, property rights and more, in a rural area that also has homes and schools nearby. Clean energy and environmental groups have also led resistance to the proposal. Rich said Trump and U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins “joined forces with me and all the residents of Cheatham County.” “They pulled out under threat,” Rich said about TVA in a social media post Tuesday. ""They pulled out because they’re afraid President Trump is going to fire every member on that board.” Based on feedback, the federal utility says it is considering a site at a nearby industrial park and other Middle Tennessee locations. Additionally, it floated options such as working with the Trump administration to extend the use of some fossil fuel plants. The utility has been planning to retire the last of its coal-fired plants by 2035. But Trump has signed executive orders aimed at boosting the coal industry. Power from the proposed Cheatham plant was intended to replace some of the electricity from the second unit of the coal-fired Cumberland Fossil Plant, which had been planned for retirement in 2028 but is now among the coal units being evaluated for potentially longer life. The site that sparked opposition includes the power plant and a battery storage system on 286 acres in Cheatham County, in addition to a 12-mile natural gas pipeline and up to 45 miles of transmission lines to the project. Rich last week posted a map showing many areas of farmland around the preferred area, saying it “CANNOT happen.” Rollins, the agriculture secretary, replied, “ON IT” and “Standby.” Rich additionally has called for a “complete revamping” of TVA, saying, “Cheatham County ain't the only place they're doing this.” Any final decision on the plant would need to await the installation of more TVA board members. Trump recently announced four nominees for the board, which for months has not had enough members to take many actions because Trump fired some of former President Joe Biden’s picks. TVA provides power to more than 10 million people across seven southern states. The board normally has nine members and requires five to make a quorum. It currently has three. Trump’s picks would not be seated until the U.S. Senate confirms them. Clean energy advocates applauded TVA’s decision to back off the Cheatham County location, but said it should instead invest more in clean energy options and heed the concern of communities where similar gas plants are proposed in Cumberland City, Kingston and Memphis. “Instead of simply shifting those harmful impacts to another area, TVA should scrap its plans for a new gas plant altogether and invest in clean and cost-effective power options, like solar power and battery storage,” said Trey Bussey, a staff attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center.","Replacing high fructose corn syrup with cane sugar would cost thousands of American food manufacturing jobs, depress farm income, and boost imports of foreign sugar, all with no nutritional benefit.” Trump himself is such a fan of Diet Coke that that he had a red button installed on the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office that he can press to have a White House butler bring one in for him.","Replacing high fructose corn syrup with cane sugar would cost thousands of American food manufacturing jobs, depress farm income, and boost imports of foreign sugar, all with no nutritional benefit.” Trump himself is such a fan of Diet Coke that that he had a red button installed on the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office that he can press to have a White House butler bring one in for him.","But it wouldn't affect Trump's drink of choice, Diet Coke, which uses aspartame as a calorie-free beverage.","Replacing high fructose corn syrup with cane sugar would cost thousands of American food manufacturing jobs, depress farm income, and boost imports of foreign sugar, all with no nutritional benefit.” Trump himself is such a fan of Diet Coke that that he had a red button installed on the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office that he can press to have a White House butler bring one in for him."
Trump says Coca-Cola will use real sugar in its US flagship drink.

President Donald Trump said Wednesday that Coca-Cola has agreed to use real cane sugar in its flagship soft drink in the U.S. at his suggestion — though the company didn't confirm such a move. Any switch from high-fructose corn syrup in Coke sold in the United States would put Coca-Cola more in line with its practice in other countries, including Mexico and Australia. But it wouldn't affect Trump's drink of choice, Diet Coke, which uses aspartame as a calorie-free beverage. “I have been speaking to Coca-Cola about using REAL Cane Sugar in Coke in the United States, and they have agreed to do so,” Trump wrote on his social media site. “I’d like to thank all of those in authority at Coca-Cola. This will be a very good move by them — You’ll see. It’s just better!” A spokesperson for Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Co. said in a statement that the company appreciated Trump’s enthusiasm and promised that more details on new offerings within its products would be shared soon. Coca-Cola didn’t elaborate. But the company has long indulged U.S. fans of cane sugar by importing glass bottles of Mexican Coke to the U.S. since 2005. Returning to sugar in U.S. production, meanwhile, might affect the nation’s corn farmers, whose yields are used in artificial sweeteners. “Replacing high fructose corn syrup with cane sugar doesn’t make sense,"" Corn Refiners Association President and CEO John Bode said in a statement. ""President Trump stands for American manufacturing jobs, American farmers, and reducing the trade deficit. Replacing high fructose corn syrup with cane sugar would cost thousands of American food manufacturing jobs, depress farm income, and boost imports of foreign sugar, all with no nutritional benefit.” Trump himself is such a fan of Diet Coke that that he had a red button installed on the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office that he can press to have a White House butler bring one in for him. Despite his fondness for Diet Coke, his relationship with the company hasn't always been sweet. In a series of posts in 2012, Trump suggested diet soda might be connected to weight gain before eventually writing, “The Coca Cola company is not happy with me — that’s okay, I’ll still keep drinking that garbage.” A bottle of Diet Coke could be seen sitting next to his chair years later, at a G20 summit in 2017. And The New York Times reported in 2018 that he was drinking a dozen Diet Cokes daily. __ Associated Press writer Dee-Ann Durbin in Detroit and Josh Funk in Omaha, Nebraska, contributed to this story.","“This could have been a game-changer for mid-Michigan’s economy.” Michigan House of Representatives Speaker Matt Hall, a Republican, said he supports Trump's strategy of relying on tariffs and incentives in the tax and spending bill to bring manufacturing development to America, not overseas.","“This could have been a game-changer for mid-Michigan’s economy.” Michigan House of Representatives Speaker Matt Hall, a Republican, said he supports Trump's strategy of relying on tariffs and incentives in the tax and spending bill to bring manufacturing development to America, not overseas.","“We simply need state leaders who are focused on making sure Michigan is the best possible place to build and grow,” he said.","The Trump administration is using tariffs and other tactics to bring manufacturing in critical areas like semiconductors back to the U.S., White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement in response to Whitmer’s remarks."
Whitmer says 'massive economic uncertainty' is to blame on semiconductor project failure in Michigan,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/whitmer-says-massive-economic-uncertainty-is-to-blame-on-semiconductor-project-failure-in-michigan-2025-07-16/,"LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Plans to build a semiconductor manufacturing plant in Michigan have fallen through and Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said Wednesday that “massive economic uncertainty” is to blame. Bringing the company to Michigan was a key goal for Whitmer, a Democrat and potential 2028 presidential candidate who is in her final years as governor of the battleground state. Domestic manufacturing is a priority of President Donald Trump's second administration and the president has leveraged tariffs as a way to incentivize companies to build and stay in America. While Whitmer did not mention Trump by name in her remarks, she pointed the finger at his tariffs that have shaken up the economy periodically this year. “Their board came to this decision amid national economic turmoil, which is at risk of worsening amid threats of even higher tariffs,” Whitmer said in a statement. Whitmer did not name the company but state records show California-based technology firm Sandisk Corp. was considering the sprawling 1,300-acre site near the city of Flint and forecasted 9,400 jobs and 5,000 construction jobs as a result. Sandisk declined to comment on Wednesday. The news quickly set off dueling political statements from Republicans and Democrats in the state. The Trump administration is using tariffs and other tactics to bring manufacturing in critical areas like semiconductors back to the U.S., White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement in response to Whitmer’s remarks. Desai pointed to new semiconductor development in Texas and Arizona this year as wins garnered by the Trump administration in the chips and technology industry. Other Democrats were quick to attribute the loss in Michigan to Trump’s economic policies Wednesday. “Trump’s abandonment of long-term investments and chaotic tariff practices are not only raising costs, they just killed 10,000 good-paying jobs,” U.S. Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet, a Democrat who represents the area, said in a statement. “This could have been a game-changer for mid-Michigan’s economy.” Michigan House of Representatives Speaker Matt Hall, a Republican, said he supports Trump's strategy of relying on tariffs and incentives in the tax and spending bill to bring manufacturing development to America, not overseas. “We simply need state leaders who are focused on making sure Michigan is the best possible place to build and grow,” he said. Sandisk, known for making flash drives and memory cards, was looking to break ground on the project in 2025, according to documents provided by the Michigan Economic Development Corporation. Michigan offered Sandisk $1.925 billion in cash grants, $250 million in workforce development funding and about $3.76 billion in tax breaks, according to documents dated to August 2024. Congress passed the CHIPS and Science Act incentivizing technology development about halfway through former President Joe Biden's term. Even as Trump and Republican lawmakers have since threatened to put an end to the act, the Department of Commerce was collaborating with Sandisk on securing federal incentives through the package. Whitmer in her statement said that the company is no longer looking to build a semiconductor facility anywhere in the U.S. In a speech in May, Whitmer said she had been advocating with the Trump administration directly to help bring a chip plant to the state.","NEW YORK (AP) — Prices as of 5:30:00 PM Wednesday, July 16.","Estimated volume: 23,083 Wednesday's volume: 23,083 Open Interest: 80,938 Open Interest Change: -51616","NEW YORK (AP) — Prices as of 5:30:00 PM Wednesday, July 16.","Estimated volume: 23,083 Wednesday's volume: 23,083 Open Interest: 80,938 Open Interest Change: -51616"

3 Stocks to Cushion Your Portfolio This Earnings Season,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/3-stocks-to-cushion-your-portfolio-this-earnings-season/,"Stocks are moving higher ahead of earnings season. Many of the big technology stocks are expected to do well. However, the same can't be said for all sectors. According to FactSet, consumer staples stocks are expected to average negative earnings growth of around 3%. That’s better than consumer discretionary stocks, which are expected to average negative growth of approximately 5.4%. This bearish earnings outlook confirms that many of the same themes from the first quarter are still in play. Inflation is sticky in some consumer-facing areas like food. Companies are also likely to continue hedging, if not abstaining from issuing future guidance, due to unknowns around tariffs. Tech stocks are still a strong growth area. However, the sector may be too volatile for investors who value income above growth. The good news is that some defensive stocks can protect portfolios from downside risk and still offer growth. PepsiCo. Inc. NASDAQ: PEP stock is down 11.75% in 2025 and more than 18% over the last 12 months. The company’s revenue has been down year-over-year (YOY) for four quarters. In the last quarter, that slowdown showed up in negative earnings per share (EPS) growth. There are concerns about persistent inflation putting a ceiling on the company’s pricing power. Investors are also concerned about how a beverage and snack food company will fare when GLP-1 drugs curb appetite for its products. However, the miss in revenue and earnings doesn’t seem to hint at more than a cyclical shift based on economic pressures. The likelihood of lower interest rates is likely to benefit a company like Pepsi, which can get more shelf space due to its leadership in two categories. From a technical standpoint, PEP stock shows signs of a bullish reversal with the stock price now above the 50-day simple moving average (SMA). There is potential resistance at the stock’s current level. Investors are likely to get more clarity when the company reports earnings on July 17. Procter & Gamble NYSE: PG is down 9.1% in 2025 and hit a 52-week low on July 15. Some of this is likely due to investors shifting to growth stocks. However, the stock has been in a downtrend since the beginning of the year as consumers look for private label brands. This was reflected in the company’s third quarter 2025 earnings report. P&G missed on the topline and beat EPS expectations by 1 cent. Moreover, both numbers were down YOY. Procter & Gamble reports earnings on July 29 and is expected to show growth and margin strength. The company will also announce additional share buybacks in addition to its already announced dividend payment of $1.05 per share. At 24x earnings, the stock is trading right around the average of the S&P 500, which is at 25.5x. However, PG stock is trading at a discount to its historical averages. Plus, the company generates approximately 50% of its revenue overseas, which is bullish against the weaker U.S. dollar. The PG stock chart confirms the opportunity. The relative strength indicator (RSI) shows an oversold condition that opportunistic investors can capitalize on ahead of earnings. Among the three stocks in this article, Costco Wholesale Corp. NASDAQ: COST has continued to deliver for investors. Over the last five years, COST stock has posted a total return of 233.5%. The company’s subscription membership model and low prices continue to mean the company is growing and profitable. However, for investors, this also means that COST stock is expensive. It’s not about the stock price, which was over $1,000 at one point. It’s the P/E ratio, which is over 55x. Stocks can be expensive for a reason, but the combination of a high stock price with a lofty valuation can cause investors to slow down their buying. That's all that’s happening now. In its last earnings report in late May, Costco delivered a whopping 8% same-store sales growth. But in early July, the company reported 5.5% same-store sales growth for June. That was slightly lower than the 6% analysts expected. It was also a reason for some investors to take profits. If it breaks support at its 200-day SMA, COST stock could fall further. An area around $957 has served as both support and resistance in the past year, and a 9% drop from the stock’s high in June would be about a 9% drop.

The international media and entertainment conglomerate filed a lawsuit in federal court in Los Angeles against the Red Earth Group, which sells jewelry online under the name Satéur. Disney says the marketing and branding of the rings, necklaces and earrings in Satéur's “Mickey 1928 Collection” violate its trademark rights and that the Hong Kong company is deliberately trying to fool customers into thinking the pieces are official Disney merchandise. Satéur, the suit alleges, “intends to present Mickey Mouse as its own brand identifier for its jewelry merchandise and ""seeks to trade on the recognizability of the Mickey Mouse trademarks and consumers’ affinity for Disney and its iconic ambassador Mickey Mouse.” A message seeking comment from representatives of the Red Earth Group was not immediately answered. The lawsuit is indicative of Disney's dogged efforts to protect its intellectual property from unauthorized appropriation. Although the earliest version of Mickey Mouse entered the public domain last year after Disney's copyright expired, the company still holds trademark rights to the character. Lawyers for Disney argue in the suit that Red Earth’s online marketing efforts “extensively trade on the Mickey Mouse trademarks and the Disney brand” with language that includes describing the jewelry as great for “Disney enthusiasts.” Such tactics indicate Red Earth was “intentionally trying to confuse consumers,” the lawsuit says. The impression created, it says, ""suggests, at a minimum, a partnership or collaboration with Disney.” The earliest depiction of Mickey Mouse, who first appeared publicly in the film short “Steamboat Willie” in 1928, are now in the U.S. public domain. The widely publicized moment was considered a landmark in iconography going public. The lawsuit alleges that Red Earth and Satéur are trying to use that status as a “ruse” to suggest the jewelry is legal, by dubbing it the “Mickey 1928 Collection” and saying it is being sold in tribute to the mouse's first appearance. The centerpiece of the collection, the suit says, is a piece of jewelry marketed as the ""Satéur Mickey 1928 Classique Ring,” which has a Steamboat Willie charm sitting on the band holding a synthetic stone. But there is an essential difference between copyright — which protects works of art — and trademark — which protects a company's brand. Even if a character is in the public domain, it cannot be used on merchandise in a way that suggests it is from the company with the trademark, as Disney alleges Red Earth is doing. “Disney remains committed to guarding against unlawful trademark infringement and protecting consumers from confusion caused by unauthorized uses of Mickey Mouse and our other iconic characters,” Disney said in a statement Wednesday. The lawsuit seeks an injunction against Red Earth selling the jewelry or trading on Disney's trademark in any other way, along with monetary damages to be determined later.","The Nasdaq is up 144.96 points, or 0.7%.","The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5%, and the Nasdaq composite gained 0.3%.",The S&P 500 added 0.3% Wednesday after whipping through an earlier drop and subsequent recovery.,President Donald Trump sent the U.S. stock market on a jagged round trip after saying he had “talked about the concept of firing” the head of the Federal Reserve.

This Fund Manager Says You Should Get Out of Tesla and Apple—Now,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/this-fund-manager-says-you-should-get-out-of-tesla-and-apple-now/,"If you currently hold Tesla NASDAQ: TSLA and Apple NASDAQ: APPL—two popular Magnificent Seven stocks—you might want to consider rotating out of them and into Broadcom NASDAQ: AVGO and Oracle NYSE: ORCL instead. This advice comes from Vimal Patel, Co‑Portfolio Manager of the Columbia Seligman Global Technology Fund (SHGTX), whose mutual fund has outperformed its tech-sector peers by 6% over the past five years. Tech stocks are navigating a volatile 2025 landscape marked by geopolitical tension, softening consumer demand, and tariff uncertainty. Patel believes that while the Magnificent Seven mega-cap tech stocks have dominated headlines, some are losing momentum in the current environment. He argues that Apple and Tesla are particularly exposed to those risks and face headwinds that could cap future growth, while Broadcom and Oracle are capitalizing on transformative trends like artificial intelligence (AI), chip customization, and enterprise cloud computing. So, is this a good idea? Let's take a closer look. SHGTX doesn’t own any shares of TSLA, and that’s by design (the fund doesn't currently own any Mag 7 stocks). Patel sees Tesla’s first-mover advantage eroding as new competition emerges, particularly from China’s BYD OTCMKTS: BYDDY and NIO NYSE: NIO. Legacy automakers like BMW ETR: BMW, Volkswagen ETR: VOW3, and General Motors NYSE: GM are also accelerating electric vehicle (EV) production, sparking a global price war and threatening Tesla’s position at the top of the EV food chain. Tesla’s stock is no longer supported by clear leadership or sustainable margins, according to Patel, and he is skeptical of Musk's longer-term plays in robotics and autonomous driving. Apple comprises 3.4% of the Columbia Seligman Global Technology Fund, with over 407,000 shares owned, valued at $81.7 million. Still, Patel advises shedding the stock, citing a stagnant iPhone product line, a sketchy AI strategy, and supply chain vulnerabilities tied to the company’s China partnership, which the ongoing tariff wars could negatively impact. Apple shares are down 16.9% so far in 2025, although the stock has rebounded 22% since mid-April. Patel is on target with the iPhone issue, which has contributed to AAPL’s declining market share value. ""Our Key First Look Data reflects weaker iPhone sales at -6% y/y, with sell-through below normal seasonal trends (m/m) due to pull ins from tariff-related pricing concerns the last two months and generally weaker iPhone demand,"" KeyBanc analyst John Vinh wrote in a new research note. On the upside, Apple is seeing 12% growth in its App Store after a tariff-based slow growth period, with 18% growth in the US against a 10% rise globally (non-US), according to YBS analyst David Vogt, who recently popped a $210 price target on AAPL shares, right about the stock’s current price. Broadcom earns pluses from Patel for its design of in-demand hyperscaling silicon microchips, such as those used by tech heavyweights like Amazon NASDAQ: AMZN and Microsoft NASDAQ: MSFT. These application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are optimized for AI training and inference tasks, making them more efficient and cost-effective than general-purpose chips. This puts Broadcom in a semiconductor sweet spot, supplying the infrastructure behind the most compute-intensive AI workloads. The numbers back it up: Broadcom shares have surged 76% over the past three months. The company sports a robust balance sheet, a lucrative partner base, ample free cash flow, and a growing number of data center customers, which comprise the bulk of AVGO’s $65 billion in anticipated sales revenue in 2025. Additionally, Broadcom’s expected earnings per share should rise $25% annually through 2027. Analysts have given the stock a consensus Buy rating and raised their price targets recently, reflecting confidence in the chipmaker’s AI positioning and robust financials. Oracle is another high riser in mid-2025, with its share price up 90% over the past three months and up 38.8% year-to-date. The company should sustain that growth after a new batch of cloud service software agreements was rolled out in the past week, which are expected to yield over $30 billion by 2028. Oracle is a key partner (along with SoftBank Group OTCMKTS: SFTBY and OpenAI) in the AI data center consortium rolled out by the White House as part of the Stargate Project, a $500 billion government-business initiative that the Trump administration calls the “largest AI infrastructure in history.” Oracle should also benefit from the passage of the recently enacted “Big Beautiful Budget Bill,” mainly due to tax savings considerations included in the bill that favor software companies in key spending areas, such as research and development and operations management. Analysts tracked by Marketbeat have given Oracle a Moderate Buy and a consensus target price of $211. The stock also comes with a modest 0.86% dividend yield. To be clear, Patel isn’t trying to rewrite what stocks make up the Magnificent Seven. What he is doing is sending a message to investors: just because a stock has been dominant historically doesn’t mean it’s still the best choice. His recommendation to get out of Tesla and Apple and get into Broadcom and Oracle reflects a deeper shift in the future tech growth and where its coming from. For investors looking to align their portfolios with the next wave of tech innovation, one that will be driven by artificial intelligence, purpose-built chips, and enterprise cloud infrastructure, Patel’s strategy offers a compelling case. But ultimately, it is up to individual investors and their risk tolerance to decide what's best for them and their portfolios.

JNJ’s Stock Price Is Back in Rally Mode—The Time to Buy Is Now,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/jnjs-stock-price-is-back-in-rally-modethe-time-to-buy-is-now/,"After years of post-COVID-19 normalization and the impact of its Kenvue spinoff, Johnson & Johnson’s NYSE: JNJ stock price is back in rally mode. It is still early in the game, but the Q2 results affirm that growth is back, acceleration is happening and is expected to continue in the back half of the year. Acceleration may be stronger than forecasted due to expected approvals and pipeline progress that promise to sustain this company’s growth over the long term. The critical takeaway is that this Dividend King’s capital return is as safe as ever and will continue to grow for the foreseeable future. Elements aligning with the outlook for stock price rally include the price action in 2025, the stochastic and MACD indicators, and the cluster of moving averages, which shows solid support as of mid-July. The price action is central to the rally thesis. It showed solid support at the $145 level in 2023, 2024, and again in 2025, followed by a higher level at $150 later in the year. The move to a higher support level indicates bullish sentiment advancing, which was confirmed by the price surge following the release. The market rose above the cluster of moving averages, representing broad market support, and triggered buying signals in the indicators. Both stochastic and MACD have swung into converging bullish entry signals on the weekly and daily charts, creating a strong buy signal with a convergence of convergences. This indicates that a high percentage of market participants are behind the move. The cluster of moving averages, visible on the chart of weekly prices, comprises the short-term 30-day moving average for traders and speculators, as well as the longer-term 150-day and 150-week EMAs for buy-and-hold investors. This cluster serves as the launchpad for a longer-term, sustained rally driven by results. Johnson & Johnson had a solid Q2 with strength in both operating segments, revealing strength in the broader pharmaceutical and medtech industries. The company produced $23.7 billion in reported earnings, up 5.8% compared to last year and 370 basis points better than expected. Favorable FX tailwinds impacted the top and bottom line, but are not the only reasons for strength. Operational performance, new products, and demand also contributed to a 7.8% increase in the U.S. business and growth abroad. Segmentally, MedTech was strongest, with a 7.3% increase and 6.1% adjusted growth, while Innovative Medicine grew by 4.9% reported and 3.8% adjusted. Margin news is also favorable to the rally. The company improved its gross and operating margin due to quality and FX tailwinds, leaving the net at $5.54 billion or up 18% compared to last year. The bottom line of $2.77 in adjusted earnings is also better than MarketBeat’s reported consensus, outperforming the estimate by 330 basis points, and the margin is expected to remain solid through year’s end. Johnson & Johnson’s guidance is a catalyst for higher share prices. It includes increased expectations for revenue and earnings that exceeded the consensus estimates at the mid-point, and may be cautious. The critical takeaway is that the outlook aligns with the outlook for increasing capital return, which is robust. JNJ’s incremental share repurchases provide modest leverage for investors, as they reap a 3.35% annualized yield. Analysts' trends align with JNJ's budding stock market rally. They include increased numbers of current reports, those less than 12 months old, a firm Moderate Buy rating, and price targets ranging around the $70 level. The $70 level aligns with the top of JNJ’s two-year trading range and is this market's critical resistance and trigger point.

"One Tech Tip: How to clean your computer, earbuds and smartphone",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/one-tech-tip-how-to-clean-your-computer-earbuds-and-smartphone-2025-07-17/,"LONDON (AP) — Smartphones, laptops, headphones and other electronic devices are essential for work and play in our daily lives. But all that time spent typing, scrolling or listening also means our devices gradually accumulate grime that needs to be cleaned off. You might not give much thought to cleaning your devices but there are reasons you should, says Logitech, which makes keyboards, webcams and other computer peripherals. “Regular cleaning and proper maintenance not only keeps your gadgets looking pristine, and wins you hygiene points, it also helps them perform better and last longer,” the company says. “In the case of devices like earbuds, the accumulated bacteria and debris may even cause health issues or discomfort.” Here are some pointers on cleaning your tech: Always check if the manufacturer has any specific guidelines for cleaning. Assemble some basic equipment and material for cleaning, which should include a soft and lint-free cleaning cloth, like a microfiber cloth; cotton swabs; a soft-bristled brush like a toothbrush, paintbrush or makeup brush; compressed air and isopropyl alcohol. Isopropyl, or rubbing alcohol, is a non-toxic cleaning solvent that’s antiseptic and antibacterial. It's popular for cleaning electronics because it doesn’t leave any residue and dries quickly. But you might want to wear gloves to avoid skin irritation. Drip some of it on a cloth instead of pouring it directly onto your device. Also heed some of the more specific warnings below. Water and mild soap can be useful for cleaning dirty surfaces, but isopropyl alcohol is recommended for cleaning the internals of a device, said Alex Diaz-Kokaisl, senior technical writer at electronics repair company iFixit. “While there isn’t a hard-and-fast rule for cleaning electronics, we generally use high-concentration isopropyl alcohol (more than 90%) because it evaporates quickly,” he said. “The faster a liquid evaporates, the less likely it is to affect any components that conduct electricity.” For whatever device you're cleaning, disconnect or power it off first. Remove any cases, plugs, covers and accessories. When using a computer, the keyboard and mouse are the parts that are touched most often and therefore need the most frequent cleaning. And all those crevices between a keyboard's keys are sure to catch crumbs. To remove any loose debris, iFixit's official in-house cleaning guide recommends using a can of compressed air. Run the spray back and forth across the keys to blow out any bits. If possible, hold the keyboard upside down so the debris falls out. If you don’t have compressed air, Logitech suggests using a hair dryer on the cold air setting. Some social media users also recommend a handheld balloon pump. Next, dampen a cleaning cloth with water and gently wipe down the keyboard and mouse. Logitech says you can also use rubbing alcohol but recommends you test it first on an inconspicuous spot to make sure it doesn't cause discoloration or scrub the lettering off the keys. Anti-bacterial baby wipes can also work on devices like a mouse, Diaz-Kokaisl said. “There shouldn’t be enough liquid to seep through cracks in the shell, and their residue typically evaporates faster than just using soap and water,” he said. For laptop screens or external monitors, use a dry microfiber cloth to gently wipe away fingerprint smudges. If there are more stubborn spots — like food stains or sneezy spatters — dampen the cloth with distilled water or a 50/50 solution of distilled water and vinegar. Computer maker Lenovo says the “gentle acidity of vinegar can help break down oils and fingerprints.” Avoid using household glass cleaners, which can contain ammonia that could damage the screen. The same goes for paper towels, which can scratch the screen. HP also warns against using rubbing alcohol. A lot of people listen to music or podcasts through their earbuds, but that also means they'll need regular cleaning to remove any earwax, natural skin oils or other grungy buildup. If the earbuds have silicon tips, remove them. Cleaning procedures vary depending on your brand and model. Logitech and Bose recommend using soapy water. But Sony warns against water or wet wipes because they can speed deterioration, and, instead, advises using a dry cloth. Use a cotton swab to wipe the earbud nozzles clean. Owners of Apple AirPods need to follow a much more elaborate procedure to clean the mesh. You'll need a child's toothbrush, two small cups, a paper towel, distilled water, as well as micellar water — typically used as a facial cleanser. Pour some micellar water into a cup, dip the toothbrush, brush the AirPod's various mesh parts, and then blot them dry with the paper. Repeat twice. Then repeat that procedure but using the distilled water to rinse off the micellar water. Finally, let the AirPods dry for at least two hours. To clean the rest of the AirPod's body, use a damp cloth. And don't forget about the charging case. Apple recommends brushing out any debris and then wiping with a dry cloth. If needed, dampen it with isopropyl alcohol. What about over-the-ear headphones? Bose says you should wipe them down at least once a week, especially after working out, to remove any dirt and bacteria hiding in the nooks and crannies. Remove the pads and use a cloth dampened with soapy water to clean them. Apple has issued specific instructions on its website for cleaning various iPhone models. Samsung has posted similar guidelines for its Galaxy lineup. They both advise using a soft, lint-free cloth, such as a lens cleaning cloth, to gently wipe the outside of the phone. Apple warns against using any cleaning products, which could erode the oil-repellent coating that most iPhones come with. Both companies say it’s OK to use disinfectants such as rubbing alcohol to gently clean the exterior, but avoid bleach or hydrogen peroxide. ___ Is there a tech topic that you think needs explaining?

Indigenous Wampis are ambushed in Peru after government backs out of anti-mining joint patrol,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/indigenous-wampis-are-ambushed-in-peru-after-government-backs-out-of-anti-mining-joint-patrol-2025-07-16/,"BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — An attack by armed assailants on a patrol of a mission by the Indigenous Wampis guards last week in the Peruvian Amazon has again brought into focus the issue of illegal gold mining in the ancestral territory. The 60-member mission was ambushed and shot at as they were patrolling near the Wampis community of Fortaleza on Saturday, just days after the Peruvian government’s sudden withdrawal from a planned joint enforcement operation to confront the illegal mining. No one was hurt in the attack. For two years, the Wampis Nation has pressed state agencies and the public prosecutor's office in Peru to work together to monitor for and remove illegal mining operations from the Santiago River basin. Days before a scheduled joint operation, government agencies pulled out without explanation, according to Amazon Watch, a U.S.-based environmental and Indigenous rights nonprofit. In response, the Wampis launched their own mission and its first patrol was attacked on Saturday. Indigenous leaders say the incident highlights the growing risks faced by land defenders and the government’s failure to uphold its promises. A Wampis official described the attack to The Associated Press. The around 60 Indigenous leaders, community guards and technicians were tasked with monitoring the environmental impacts of illegal gold mining in the Bajo Rio Santiago region. “People started throwing explosives — I don’t even know what kind they were — and then came the gunfire,” said Evaristo Pujupat Shirap, 45, communications officer for the Autonomous Territorial Government of the Wampis Nation. “Bullets hit the vehicle and even pierced a teacher’s jacket at chest level,” Shirap added. The Peruvian government did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Members on the Wampis mission were armed with hunting rifles, but according to Shirap, leaders had instructed the group not to fire under any circumstances. While they did fire a few warning shots into the air, no direct confrontation took place, Shirap added. “We will not stand by while our rivers are poisoned and our forests destroyed,” said Galois Yampis, vice president of the Wampis government. Peru's ""government failed to honor its commitments, so we are acting to defend our territory and the future of our people,” he added. The Indigenous Wampis territorial guards are community-led environmental defenders trained and organized by the autonomous territorial government of the Wampis Nation. Their aim is to protect Wampis ancestral lands from illegal activities such as mining, logging, and drug trafficking, while upholding their cultural values and vision of Tarimat Pujut — a life in harmony with nature. Raphael Hoetmer, Amazon program director at Amazon Watch, a longtime ally of the Wampis, said they only confront violent criminals — ""yet are left to face danger without state protection.” The Wampis Nation has long been urging Peru and gold-importing nations to strengthen enforcement against illegal gold trade and invest in Indigenous-led territorial monitoring and sustainable development. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

3 Drone Stocks Take Flight on Hegesth's Bold Memo: Who and Why,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/3-drone-stocks-take-flight-on-hegesths-bold-memo-who-and-why/,"Several drone stocks surged on July 11 after the United States Department of Defense (DoD) released a memo with highly bullish implications for the industry. In the memo titled “Unleashing U.S. Military Drone Dominance,"" Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth shared his vision for increased U.S. drone production and use. Let’s dive into some of the specifics of the memo and the defense stocks that were among the biggest beneficiaries. Hegseth says the United States has fallen behind the rest of the world in drone production. Now, to bridge this gap, Hegseth is “rescinding restrictive policies that hindered production."" However, the one-page memo didn’t provide much detail on what is actually changing in U.S. drone policy. Publications like The War Zone reveal that the memo largely focuses on increasing U.S. production of small drones, such as those made by Red Cat NASDAQ: RCAT. Small drones like Red Cat’s Black Widow will now be “accounted for as consumable commodities, not durable property."" This empowers soldiers to use these drones without worrying about whether adversaries will destroy them. By the end of 2026, Hegseth wants to equip every squad with cheap and expendable drones. This shift could lead to big-time sales boosts for Red Cat down the road. In response to this news, Red Cat soared over 26% on July 11 and another 20% on July 14. In 2024, the Black Widow became the winner of the U.S. Army’s Short Range Reconnaissance (SRR) Program of Record, making it the sole drone used by the Army in SRR. Red Cat only recorded around $16.5 million in sales over the last 12 months. Thus, the company has a significant opportunity to grow from that small base. Hegseth’s memo increases the likelihood of this happening. Although the memo is largely focused on small drones, Kratos Defense and Security Solutions NASDAQ: KTOS also saw shares rise nearly 12% on July 11. Kratos makes much larger fighter jet drones, but there are multiple key reasons why the memo is a positive for the firm. Hegseth wants America to “power the technological leapfrog” in drone technology, which lines up with Kratos’ jet drone focus. Additionally, there was an overarching emphasis in the memo on low-cost drones. Kratos has become known for making affordability a central tenet of the technologies it offers. Kratos developed the XQ-58A under the Air Force’s Low-Cost Attritable Aircraft Technology (LCAAT) Initiative. Attritable means that due to its low cost, the military can replace the drone if it is lost in battle. A XQ-58A currently costs between $4 million and $6 million. This is much cheaper than manned jets like Lockheed Martin’s NYSE: LMT F-35 at $80 million to $100 million each. Still, Kratos is working to get the XQ-58A price tag down to $2 million, largely through increased production. When it comes to advanced jet drones, Kratos' focus on affordability makes the company a prime drone jet partner for the U.S. military. Lastly, the memo highlighted the idea that the military should “train as we expect to fight."" By next year, Hegseth wants to see the military train by simulating battles using drones on both sides. Tying into this, Kratos also has a large focus on making target drones, which are used to mimic real fighting. In fact, the company is forecasting between $240 million and $250 million in target drone revenue in 2025. That accounts for more than 80% of its forecasted unmanned systems revenue. Thus, the company could see a big uptick in orders of target drones given the memo’s emphasis on training. Overall, Kratos' focus on technological advancement, affordability, and target drones clearly lines up with Hegseth’s vision, leading to a big rise in shares. AeroVironment NASDAQ: AVAV also gained 11% on July 11. The company makes a variety of drones of different sizes. Only some of its products will shift from the “durable” to the “consumable” classification. Still, the overall push toward expanded U.S. military drone adoption is good for this name. Overall, the Trump administration is clearly taking a more favorable stance on drone warfare. This means the overall pie for this industry will grow bigger, benefiting many players. Still, these firms will fiercely fight to carve out their own niches, making paying attention to changes in the competitive landscape going forward vital for investors.

"Daunted by geopolitics and trade war, US companies in China report record-low new investment plans",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/faced-with-geopolitics-and-trade-war-us-companies-in-china-report-record-low-new-investment-plans-2025-07-16/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — American companies in China are reporting record-low new investment plans for this year and declining confidence in their profitability, with uncertainty in U.S.-China relations and President Donald Trump’s tariffs their top concerns, according to a survey released Wednesday. The companies are also challenged by China's slowing economy, where weak domestic demand and overcapacity in local industries are eroding profitability for the Americans. “Businesses in China are less profitable now than they were years ago, but risks, including reputational risk, regulatory risk, and political risk, are increasing,” said Sean Stein, the president of the U.S.-China Business Council, a Washington-based group that represents American companies doing business in China, including major multinationals. The survey, conducted between March and May and drawing from 130 member companies, came as the two countries clash over tariffs and non-tariff measures, including export controls on critical products such as rare-earth magnets and advanced computer chips. Following high-level talks in Geneva and London, U.S. and Chinese officials agreed to pull back from sky-high tariffs and restrictions on exports, but uncertainty persists as the two sides are yet to hammer out a more permanent trade deal. Kyle Sullivan, vice president of business advisory services at the USCBC, said more than half of the companies in the survey indicated they do not have new investment plans in China “at all” this year. ""That’s a record high,” Sullivan said, noting that it is “”a new development that we have not observed in previous surveys.” Around 40% of companies reported negative effects from U.S. export control measures, with many experiencing lost sales, severed customer relationships, and reputational damage from being unreliable suppliers, according to the survey. Citing national security, the U.S. government has banned exports to China of high-tech products, such as the most advanced chips, which could help boost China's military capabilities. Stein argued that export controls must be very carefully targeted, because businesses from Europe or Japan, or local businesses in China would immediately fill the void left by American companies. Silicon Valley chipmaker Nvidia won approval from the Trump administration to resume sales to China of its advanced H20 chips used to develop artificial intelligence, its CEO Jensen Huang announced on Monday, though the company's most powerful chips remain under U.S. export control rules. While 82% of U.S. companies reported profits in 2024, fewer than half are optimistic about the future in China, reflecting concerns over tariffs, deflation, and policy uncertainty, according to the survey. Also, a record high number of American businesses plan to relocate their business operations outside of China, Sullivan said, as 27% of the members indicated so, up from 19% the year before. In a departure from past surveys, concerns over China's regulatory environment, including risks of intellectual property misuse and lack of market access, didn’t make it to the top five concerns this year. That's likely a first, and not for a good reason, Stein said. “It is not because things got dramatically better on the Chinese side, but the new challenges, often coming from the U.S., are now posing as much of a challenge,” Stein said. Almost all the American companies said they cannot remain globally competitive without their Chinese operations. A survey from the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China in May found that European companies were cutting costs and scaling back investment plans in China as its economy slows and fierce competition drives down prices.","Sen.

Trump says he's 'highly unlikely' to fire Fed's Powell after floating that idea in private,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-says-hes-highly-unlikely-to-fire-feds-powell-after-floating-that-idea-in-private-2025-07-16/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he was “highly unlikely” to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, a public statement made less than 24 hours after suggesting in a private meeting that he was leaning in favor of dismissing the head of the nation's central bank. Trump confirmed that in a White House meeting Tuesday night with about a dozen House Republicans he had discussed the “concept” of dismissing Powell, long a target because of his refusal to lower interest rates as Trump wants. “Almost every one of them said I should,” Trump said about the lawmakers who had come to talk to him about crypto legislation. He indicated he was leaning in that direction, according to a White House official. During that session, Trump waved a letter about firing Powell, but a person familiar with the matter said it was essentially a prop drafted by someone else and that the Republican president has not drafted such a letter. Neither source was authorized to publicly discuss the private meeting and they spoke only on condition on anonymity. Trump made his comment about being “highly unlikely” to dismiss Powell — ”unless he has to leave for fraud” — during an Oval Office meeting with Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, the crown prince of Bahrain. In recent days, White House and administration officials have accused Powell of mismanaging a $2.5 billion renovation project at the Fed, adding to months of efforts by Trump try to rid himself of the politically independent central banker. U.S. stocks were shaky as Trump spoke about Powell on Wednesday. The S&P 500's modest gain in the morning became a drop of 0.7% after initial reports that the president may fire the Fed chair. Stocks then trimmed their losses after Trump's later comment. Treasury yields also swiveled in the bond market but remained mostly calm. Those at the White House meeting were among the more far-right lawmakers, including members of the House Freedom Cause whose views are not always shared by other Republicans. In the Senate, Republicans have taken a more guarded approach. Some have backed Powell’s performance at the Fed as they await an inspector general's review of the construction project. In a speech Wednesday, Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said if Powell is dismissed, “you are going to see a pretty immediate response” “If anybody thinks it would be a good idea for the Fed to become another agency in the government subject to the president, they’re making a huge mistake,"" said Tillis, who has announced that he is not running for reelection.

The EU chief unveils a new $2.3 trillion budget. Lawmakers say the math doesn't 'add up',https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/the-eu-chief-unveils-a-new-23-trillion-budget-lawmakers-say-the-math-doesnt-add-up-2025-07-16/,"BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union needs a new budget that would allow it to respond to crises like Russia’s war on Ukraine or climate change, fund railways and energy grids, and protect farmers’ livelihoods, the EU chief said Wednesday while unveiling her proposal totaling 2 trillion euros ($2.3 trillion). European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who heads the EU’s executive branch, said that under her budget plan, spending on defense and space would increase five-fold, while investment in migration and border management would triple. The proposal kicks off two years of wrangling between the 27 member states which fund most of the budget and the European Parliament. The spending package — which runs from 2028 to 2034 — is seen as a statement about Europe’s ambitions in the world. Von der Leyen described her plan for the budget – known as the Multiannual Financial Framework – as “the most ambitious ever proposed.” “It is more strategic, more flexible, more transparent, and we are investing more in our capacity to respond and more in our independence,” she told reporters in Brussels. But in an early sign of the troubles ahead, von der Leyen conceded that even within her own team of policy commissioners — which worked through the night to finalize the proposal – “not everyone was satisfied with the amount.” EU lawmakers who will chaperone the commission’s proposal through parliament over the next year and 2027, and who were briefed on it, said that the budget math doesn't ""add up.” “However you try to package this, what we have is a real-terms investment and spending freeze,” they said in a statement. “It is the status quo, which the Commission has always insisted is not an option.” Part of the numbers confusion is due to von der Leyen's insistence that national contributions to the budget will not increase. Extra funds would be found through “a step change” in the way the commission raises its own money, she said. The EU as a bloc is not allowed to levy its own taxes, but it does earn revenue from things like customs duties and value added tax. The plan now is to get money through the carbon emissions trading system and a new tobacco duty, among other measures. At the same time, the EU must also pay off billions of euros in debt incurred by measures introduced to stop the spread of COVID-19 and to help revive economies after the pandemic. As for security, von der Leyen said 100 billion euros ($116 billion) should be set aside to help Ukraine rebuild from the ravages of the war, now in its fourth year. “We are suggesting 100 billion euros ... to support recovery, resilience, and of course their path to the EU membership,” she said. Outside the commission headquarters, as von der Leyen’s team debated the plan, around 200 farmers gathered and threw boots at the building. “Everybody is talking about security for Europe. Everybody is talking about a stronger Europe. Well ,let me tell you, you can’t get stronger with an empty stomach,” said Lode Ceyssens, head of the Belgian farmers trade union Boerenbond. ___ Associated Press journalist Sylvain Plazy in Brussels contributed to this report.","Considering that up to 19.4% of Super Micro Computer's short float is held in short positions, ranking up a dollar value of as much as $4.7 billion, most of this balance could be redeemed in buying activity if the stock delivers another double-digit month of upside.","That wide gap in performance could allow this potential short squeeze to push Super Micro Computer stock back to such highs, especially if the market is right in its assumption that Meta will contract the company for its new data centers.","This will likely happen, since other major players in the data center space, such as NVIDIA Co.

Super Micro Stock May Benefit as Cooling Demand Takes Off,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/super-micro-stock-may-benefit-as-cooling-demand-takes-off/,"Most companies in the technology sector are now beginning to recognize the importance of having the right footprint and infrastructure in place for their data center capacity. As the demand for artificial intelligence and cloud computing has skyrocketed and continues to rise, this has become an undeniable theme in the industry. For this reason, making the cost of running data centers as efficient as possible will also be a theme that investors won't want to miss, since the success of most of the technology and its infrastructure relies on this achievement. With this in mind, investors can look to one of the leading names in bringing this cost down through its industry-leading liquid cooling system for data centers. That company is Super Micro Computer Inc. NASDAQ: SMCI. This stock has surprised many investors over the past couple of years in terms of volatility and overcoming most (if not all) of the negative media that came its way while driving the stock price lower. Even after a stellar recovery, however, there is still ample room for this name to trend higher. One of the latest technology players to announce its expansion in the data center space is Meta Platforms Inc. NASDAQ: META. Considering the sizable need this behemoth may have for data centers, this could be enough of a tailwind for investors to start building into their potential buying thesis. However, one assumption needs to be made here: Meta will choose Super Micro Computer as its provider of cooling services for these new data centers, especially as the toll these centers take on the energy grid becomes a concern. That being said, investors can judge the likelihood of this happening based on Super Micro Computer's recent price action. Over the past month, this stock has already delivered a net rally of up to 21.7%, which also brings its quarterly run to a very aggressive 66.7%. Since markets are forward-looking, it isn't too far-fetched to believe that the expectation lies in Meta ultimately choosing Super Micro Computer as its efficiency provider in these new data centers. Still, plenty more indicators serve as evidence to support the potential scenario that is playing out. Not only is the price action bullish enough to justify this belief, but another month like this could turn Super Micro Computer stock into the next short squeeze story. A short squeeze is an event in which short sellers are forced to close their positions at a loss, resulting in buying the underlying stock and creating additional buying pressure. Considering that up to 19.4% of Super Micro Computer's short float is held in short positions, ranking up a dollar value of as much as $4.7 billion, most of this balance could be redeemed in buying activity if the stock delivers another double-digit month of upside. If a short squeeze happens, investors will likely notice Super Micro Computer reaching its previous 52-week high of $96.3 per share. Considering that high benchmark, today's price represents only 55% of the 52-week high, falling significantly behind other peers in the industry. That wide gap in performance could allow this potential short squeeze to push Super Micro Computer stock back to such highs, especially if the market is right in its assumption that Meta will contract the company for its new data centers. This will likely happen, since other major players in the data center space, such as NVIDIA Co. NASDAQ: NVDA, have already been working with Super Micro Computer for these services. Considering this potential, there is also one last gauge to believe in this development. Because of the bullish price action and the fundamental developments, some institutional investors decided that this might be the right time to boost their holdings in Super Micro Computer stock, such as the Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio, which raised its stake by 4.7% as of early July 2025. After that new allocation, the group now holds up to $7.9 million in Super Micro Computer stock, a decision that likely underwent a lot of scrutiny and analysis to be justified.

Trump's bid to claw back $9B in foreign aid and public broadcasting funds nears Senate vote,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trumps-bid-to-claw-back-9b-in-foreign-aid-and-public-broadcasting-funds-nears-senate-vote-2025-07-16/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate is poised to pass Donald Trump's request to cancel about $9 billion in foreign aid and public broadcasting spending, moving forward on one of the president's top priorities despite concerns from several Republican senators. The legislation, which would go next to the House, would have a tiny impact on the nation's rising debt but could have major ramifications for the spending that is targeted, from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to U.S. food aid programs abroad. It could also complicate efforts to pass additional spending bills this year, as Democrats and some Republicans have argued that they are ceding congressional spending powers to Trump with little idea of how the White House Office of Management and Budget would apply the cuts. The move to claw back a sliver of federal spending comes after Republicans also muscled Trump’s big tax and spending cut bill to approval without any Democratic support. The Congressional Budget Office has projected that measure will increase future federal deficits by about $3.3 trillion over the coming decade. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said Republicans were using the president’s rescissions request to target wasteful spending, and it is a “small but important step for fiscal sanity that we all should be able to agree is long overdue.” But Senate Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Susan Collins, R-Maine, said the bill “has a big problem – nobody really knows what program reductions are in it.” Collins was one of three Republicans who voted against moving forward with the bill in a Tuesday procedural vote, along with Sens. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. Vice President J.D. Vance cast a tiebreaking vote to put the legislation on a path to passage. McConnell, the former Republican leader, held out the possibility that he would vote for final passage of the bill, but said he was concerned that the White House wants “a blank check.” “I don't think that's appropriate,” McConnell said. Collins and Murkowski both expressed concerns about the cuts to public broadcasting, saying they could affect important rural stations in their states. Murkowski said in a speech on the Senate floor Tuesday that the stations are ""not just your news — it is your tsunami alert, it is your landslide alert, it is your volcano alert.” Less than a day later, as the Senate debated the bill, a 7.3 magnitude earthquake struck off the remote Alaska Peninsula, triggering tsunami warnings on local public broadcasting stations that advised people to get to higher ground. The situation is “a reminder that when we hear people rant about how public broadcasting is nothing more than this radical, liberal effort to pollute people's minds, I think they need to look at what some of the basic services are to communities,"" Murkowski said. The legislation would claw back nearly $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which represents the full amount it’s due to receive during the next two budget years. The corporation distributes more than 70% of the money to more than 1,500 locally operated public television and radio stations, with much of the remainder assigned to National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service to support national programming. Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., said he secured a deal from the White House that some funding administered by the Interior Department would be repurposed to subsidize Native American public radio stations in about a dozen states. But Kate Riley, president and CEO of America’s Public Television Stations, a network of locally owned and operated stations, said that deal was “at best a short-term, half-measure that will still result in cuts and reduced service at the stations it purports to save, while leaving behind all other stations, including many that serve Native populations.” The legislation would also claw back about $8 billion in foreign aid spending. Among the cuts are $800 million for a program that provides emergency shelter, water and sanitation and family reunification for those who flee their own countries and $496 million to provide food, water and health care for countries hit by natural disasters and conflicts. There's also a $4.15 billion cut for programs that aim to boost economies and democratic institutions in developing nations. Democrats argued that the Trump administration's animus toward foreign aid programs would hurt America's standing in the world and create a vacuum for China to fill. Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, said the amount of money it takes to save a starving child or prevent the transmission of disease is miniscule, even as the investments secure cooperation with the U.S. on other issues. The cuts being made to foreign aid programs through Trump's Department of Government Efficiency were having life-and-death consequences around the world, he said. “People are dying right now, not in spite of us but because of us,” Schatz said. “We are causing death.” After objections from several Republicans, GOP leaders took out a $400 million cut to PEPFAR, a politically popular program to combat HIV/AIDS that is credited with saving millions of lives since its creation under then-President George W. Bush. Democrats say the bill upends a legislative process that typically requires lawmakers from both parties to work together to fund the nation’s priorities. Triggered by the official recissions request from the White House, the legislation only needs a simple majority vote instead of the 60 votes usually required to break a filibuster, meaning Republicans can use their 53-47 majority to pass it along party lines. The Trump administration is promising more rescission packages to come if the first effort is successful. But some Republicans who supported the bill indicated they might be wary of doing so again. “Let’s not make a habit of this,” said Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker, who is backing the legislation but said he was concerned that the White House wasn’t providing enough information on what exactly will be cut. Wicker said there are members “who are very concerned, as I am, about this process.” North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis said Republicans will need to work with Democrats to keep the government running later in the year. “The only way to fund the government is to get at least seven Democrats to vote with us at the end of September or we could go into a shutdown,” Tillis said. Democrats sought to remove a variety of the proposed rescissions during a series of amendment votes lasting into the night Wednesday, but none had so far been adopted. An amendment by Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., for example, sought to remove the $496 million cut for countries hit by natural disasters. But Republicans opposed it, arguing that many foreign governments rely too much on U.S. aid. The House has already shown its support for the president’s request with a mostly party line 214-212 vote, but since the Senate is amending the bill, it will have to go back to the House for another vote. The bill must be signed into law by midnight Friday for the proposed rescissions to kick in. If Congress doesn't act by then, the spending stands. ___ Associated Press writer Becky Bohrer in Juneau, Alaska, contributed to this report.","The stock price targets for Advanced Micro Devices are based on the movement that preceded the breakout, including near-term, short-term, and long-term targets.","The stock price targets for Advanced Micro Devices are based on the movement that preceded the breakout, including near-term, short-term, and long-term targets.","AMD’s stock price has already achieved this target, rising by $10 from the critical resistance point to hit 155 in mid-July.","The sentiment is pegged at a solid Moderate Buy; the bias is due to the high number of Buy and Strong Buy ratings, which account for 73% and 13% of the total, respectively."
AMD Just Triggered a Signal Traders Can’t Ignore,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/amd-just-triggered-a-signal-traders-cant-ignore/,"Advanced Micro Devices' NASDAQ: AMD price action provided a clear signal that it would move higher in 2025 when it broke fresh highs in July. The move to new highs took the market above a critical resistance point that had been in place for more than a year, setting it up to continue rallying as the year progresses. The real question is how high the market can go now that fresh highs have been set and what will drive it there. The answer to the first question is based on both the technical setup and analyst sentiment trends. In contrast, the second includes results, forecasts, and, once again, analyst sentiment trends, along with a hint of FOMO. The stock price targets for Advanced Micro Devices are based on the movement that preceded the breakout, including near-term, short-term, and long-term targets. The near-term target is based on the near-term price movement, specifically the July rally, which is worth $10. AMD’s stock price has already achieved this target, rising by $10 from the critical resistance point to hit 155 in mid-July. The short-term and long-term targets are more interesting. They are based on stock price movements, which began in April 2025 and October 2022. They are worth $90 and $55, respectively, representing substantial gains relative to the critical resistance. Those targets are near $200 and $235, worth 37% and 60% when reached. AMD’s stock price action is being driven by analysts lifting sentiment and price targets after a wait-and-see period. The hopes priced into AMD’s 2023/2024 stock price surge are now being realized, leaving the stock undervalued due to the 2024/2025 price correction, and the rebound will likely be robust. The critical factor is that AMD’s acquisitions, technological advantages, and upcoming MI400 series have it well-positioned to deliver rack-scale AI semiconductor solutions at scale, provide AI infrastructure to hyperscalers globally, and begin taking a significant market share from NVIDIA NASDAQ: NVDA. The analysts' sentiment trends are robust, leading into the FQ2 earnings report. They include a significant increase in coverage, up 30% in under 12 months to 38, firming sentiment with a strongly bullish bias, and an increasing price target. The sentiment is pegged at a solid Moderate Buy; the bias is due to the high number of Buy and Strong Buy ratings, which account for 73% and 13% of the total, respectively. The consensus price reported by MarketBeat lags the price action in mid-July but preceding 30 days, reflecting a shift in sentiment. Recent revisions have led it up 10% to the $200 to $270 range. Q2 results will likely be a catalyst for AMD’s stock price, given the strength seen in previous quarters and the return of China sales. The resumption of sales to China means that written-off inventory can be recognized, and sales and earnings guidance will likely be much stronger than the current forecast estimate. The consensus is for a sequential decline, with year-over-year growth slowing to only 27%, which is unlikely given the current trends in the AI industry. Institutional trends are another factor supporting this market, aligning with the forecast for a higher share price. They bought on balance in Q1 and Q2 2025 and have extended the trend into the first weeks of Q3, buying at a robust pace of nearly 3-to-1 on a dollar basis. The takeaway is that positive sentiment trends, including analyst coverage, will likely continue through the year’s end. The likelihood of strong performance and guidance also raises the possibility of FOMO, or the fear of missing out, which can lead to a rapid and self-sustaining influx of capital into this market.
