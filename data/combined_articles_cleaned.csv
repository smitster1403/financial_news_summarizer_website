Asian shares charge higher after US stocks rally to records on hopes for interest rate cuts,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/asian-shares-charge-higher-after-us-stocks-rally-to-records-on-hopes-for-interest-rate-cuts-2025-08-13/,"BANGKOK (AP) — Shares advanced Wednesday in Asia after the U.S. stock market rallied to records when data showed inflation across the United States improved slightly last month. Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei 225 added to its record set a day earlier. Shares in Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia also gained more than 1%. The recent rally in share prices has been driven partly by relief over an extended truce in President Donald Trump’s trade war with China, and partly by persisting hopes the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates. Those were reinforced by a moderation in the consumer price index in July. “Asia woke up in full risk-on mode, riding the coattails of a U.S. session that looked like someone hit the ‘infinite bid’ button after CPI didn’t blow the inflation doors off,” Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. China and the U.S. agreed to extend by 90 days the pause in drastically higher tariff rates to allow more time for talks on a broad trade agreement. Although uncertainty over what the negotiations will yield remains, the truce has relieved pressure on companies and countries across Asia that rely heavily in supply chains routed through China. Hong Kong's Hang Seng surged 1.9% to 25,439.91, while the Shanghai Composite index added 0.6% to 3,686.34. In Japan, relief over the Trump administration's confirmation that its exports will face a flat 15% U.S. import duty has driven strong buying of computer chip-related companies and other exporters. The Nikkei 225 gained 1.6% to 43,407.46. Elsewhere in Asia, South Korea's Kospi advanced 0.8% to 3,215.43. In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 shed 0.5% to 8,840.30. Taiwan's Taiex was up 0.8% and the Sensex in India gained 0.4%. In Bangkok, the SET climbed 0.9%. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 rose 1.1% to top its all-time high set two weeks ago. It closed at 6,445.76. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.1% to 44,458.61, while the Nasdaq composite jumped 1.4% to set its own record of 21,681.90. Intel’s stock rose 5.6% after Trump said its CEO has an “amazing story,” less than a week after he had demanded Lip-Bu Tan’s resignation. Circle Internet Group, the company behind the popular USDC cryptocurrency that tracks the U.S. dollar, climbed 1.3% despite reporting a larger loss for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It said its total revenue and reserve income grew 53% in its first quarter as a publicly traded company, which topped forecasts. The better-than-expected report on inflation raised hopes the Federal Reserve will have the leeway to cut interest rates at its next meeting in September. Tuesday’s report said U.S. consumers paid prices for groceries, gasoline and other costs of living that were overall 2.7% higher in July than a year earlier. That’s the same inflation rate as June’s, and it was below the 2.8% that economists expected. Lower rates would give a boost to investment prices and to the economy by making it cheaper for U.S. households and businesses to borrow to buy houses, cars or equipment. President Donald Trump has angrily been calling for cuts to help the economy, often insulting the Fed’s chair personally while doing so. The Fed has hesitated, worried that Trump’s tariffs could make inflation much worse. The Fed will get one more report on inflation and another on the U.S. job market, before its next meeting, which ends Sept. 17. The most recent jobs report was a stunner, coming in much weaker than economists expected. Critics say the broad U.S. stock market is looking expensive after its surge from a bottom in April. That’s putting pressure on companies to deliver continued growth in profit. In other dealings early Wednesday, U.S. benchmark crude oil edged 4 cents higher to $63.21 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, was up 8 cents at $66.20 per barrel. The U.S. dollar rose to 147.94 Japanese yen from 147.84 yen. The euro climbed to $1.1686 from $1.1677. ___ AP Business writers Stan Choe and Matt Ott contributed.","That’s the same inflation rate as June’s, and it was below the 2.8% that economists expected.","The recent rally in share prices has been driven partly by relief over an extended truce in President Donald Trump’s trade war with China, and partly by persisting hopes the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates.","In Japan, relief over the Trump administration's confirmation that its exports will face a flat 15% U.S. import duty has driven strong buying of computer chip-related companies and other exporters.","“Asia woke up in full risk-on mode, riding the coattails of a U.S. session that looked like someone hit the ‘infinite bid’ button after CPI didn’t blow the inflation doors off,” Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary."
One of the world's most polluted cities has banned single-use plastics. It's not so easy,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/one-of-the-worlds-most-polluted-cities-has-banned-single-use-plastics-its-not-so-easy-2025-08-13/,"LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) — Nigerian shop manager Olarewanju Ogunbona says he uses Styrofoam and plastic packs at least five times a day — nothing unusual in the megacity of Lagos, one of the world's most plastics-polluted urban areas. The city's over 20 million people contributed 870,000 tons of the world's 57 million tons of plastic waste in 2024. Lagos state authorities last month imposed a ban on single-use plastics, but residents say weak enforcement and the absence of alternatives have weakened its effectiveness. Under the law that kicked off on July 1, the use of single-use plastics such as cutlery, plates and straws is banned and offenders risk their businesses being shut down. However, other forms of plastics, which make up a smaller percentage of the city’s waste, are still in use. The ban is far from being fully implemented, as some shops still display Styrofoam packs on their shelves. “Sellers are still using it very well,” said Ogunbona, who continues to buy his Styrofoam-packed meals. In Geneva this week, countries including Nigeria are negotiating a treaty to end plastic pollution. Such talks broke down last year, with oil-producing countries opposed to any limits on plastic production. In large part, plastics are made from fossil fuels like oil and gas. Lagos generates at least 13,000 tons of waste daily, almost a fifth of which is plastics, officials have said. In the absence of a proper waste management system, most of it ends up in waterways, clogging canals, polluting beaches and contributing to devastating floods. Although the state government has promoted the ban on single-use plastics as a major step, watchdogs are skeptical. “Its effectiveness is limited without strong enforcement, affordable alternatives for low-income vendors and meaningful improvements in the city’s overwhelmed waste management systems,” Olumide Idowu, a Lagos-based environmental activist, told The Associated Press. The Lagos state government did not respond to a request for comment. With the quest for a better life driving millions of Nigerians to Lagos, some in the city are finding ways to manage the pollution. Recent years have seen a rise of private waste managers and sustainability groups helping to tackle the crisis. At a sorting site in Obalende, a bustling commercial suburb adjacent to the upscale Ikoyi neighborhood, two women with razor blades scraped labels from plastic soft drink bottles. They uncapped the bottles and threw them into different nets, ready to be compressed and sold for recycling. Competition has become tougher as more people join the work, the women said. The informal network of waste collectors sell to, or sort for, private waste management companies. They can make around around 5,000 naira ($3.26) a day. But far more work is needed. Manufacturers have a key role to play in tackling the plastic waste problem, according to Omoh Alokwe, co-founder of the Street Waste Company that operates in Obalende. “They need to ... ensure that the plastics being produced into the environment are collected back and recycled,” Alokwe said. Experts also call for a behavioral change among residents for the law banning single-use plastics to be effective. Lagos residents need alternatives to plastics, shop owner Ogunbona said. Otherwise, “we will keep using them.""","Although the state government has promoted the ban on single-use plastics as a major step, watchdogs are skeptical.","Lagos state authorities last month imposed a ban on single-use plastics, but residents say weak enforcement and the absence of alternatives have weakened its effectiveness.","Lagos state authorities last month imposed a ban on single-use plastics, but residents say weak enforcement and the absence of alternatives have weakened its effectiveness.","With the quest for a better life driving millions of Nigerians to Lagos, some in the city are finding ways to manage the pollution."
Vietnam wants to be the next Asian tiger and it’s overhauling its economy to make it happen,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/vietnam-wants-to-be-the-next-asian-tiger-and-its-overhauling-its-economy-to-make-it-happen-2025-08-12/,"HANOI, Vietnam (AP) — Beneath red banners and a gold bust of revolutionary leader Ho Chi Minh in Hanoi's central party school, Communist Party chief To Lam declared the arrival of “a new era of development” late last year. The speech was more than symbolic— it signaled the launch of what could be Vietnam’s most ambitious economic overhaul in decades. Vietnam aims to get rich by 2045 and become Asia’s next “tiger economy” — a term used to describe the earlier ascent of countries like South Korea and Taiwan. The challenge ahead is steep: Reconciling growth with overdue reforms, an aging population, climate risks and creaking institutions. There's added pressure from President Donald Trump over Vietnam’s trade surplus with the U.S., a reflection of its astounding economic trajectory. In 1990, the average Vietnamese could afford about $1,200 worth of goods and services a year, adjusted for local prices. Today, that figure has risen by more than 13 times to $16,385. Vietnam's transformation into a global manufacturing hub with shiny new highways, high-rise skylines and a booming middle class has lifted millions of its people from poverty, similar to China. But its low-cost, export-led boom is slowing and it faces a growing obstacle to its proposed reforms — expanding private industries, strengthening social protections and investing in technology and green energy — from climate change. “It’s all hands on deck. . . . We can’t waste time anymore,"" said Mimi Vu of the consultancy Raise Partners. Investment has soared, driven partly by U.S.-China trade tensions, and the U.S. is now Vietnam's biggest export market. Once-quiet suburbs have been replaced with industrial parks where trucks rumble through sprawling logistics hubs that serve global brands. Vietnam ran a $123.5 billion trade surplus with the U.S. trade in 2024, angering Trump, who threatened a 46% U.S. import tax on Vietnamese goods. The two sides appear to have settled on a 20% levy, and twice that for goods suspected of being transshipped, or routed through Vietnam to avoid U.S. trade restrictions. During negotiations with the Trump administration, Vietnam's focus was on its tariffs compared to those of its neighbors and competitors, said Daniel Kritenbrink, a former U.S. ambassador to Vietnam. “As long as they’re in the same zone, in the same ballpark, I think Vietnam can live with that outcome,"" he said. But he added questions remain over how much Chinese content in those exports might be too much and how such goods will be taxed. Vietnam was preparing to shift its economic policies even before Trump's tariffs threatened its model of churning out low-cost exports for the world, aware of what economists call the “middle-income trap,” when economies tend to plateau without major reforms. To move beyond that, South Korea bet on electronics, Taiwan on semiconductors, and Singapore on finance, said Richard McClellan, founder of the consultancy RMAC Advisory. But Vietnam's economy today is more diverse and complex than those countries were at the time and it can’t rely on just one winning sector to drive long-term growth and stay competitive as wages rise and cheap labor is no longer its main advantage. It needs to make “multiple big bets,” McClellan said. Following China's lead, Vietnam is counting on high-tech sectors like computer chips, artificial intelligence and renewable energy, providing strategic tax breaks and research support in cities like Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, and Danang. It's also investing heavily in infrastructure, including civilian nuclear plants and a $67 billion North–South high-speed railway, that will cut travel time from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City to eight hours. Vietnam also aspires to become a global financial center. The government plans two special financial centers, in bustling Ho Chi Minh City and in the seaside resort city of Danang, with simplified rules to attract foreign investors, tax breaks, support for financial tech startups, and easier ways to settle business disputes. Underpinning all of this is institutional reform. Ministries are being merged, low-level bureaucracies have been eliminated and Vietnam's 63 provinces will be consolidated into 34 to build regional centers with deeper talent pools. Vietnam is counting on private businesses to lead its new economic push — a seismic shift from the past. In May, the Communist Party passed Resolution 68. It calls private businesses the “most important force” in the economy, pledging to break away from domination by state-owned and foreign companies. So far, large multinationals have powered Vietnam's exports, using imported materials and parts and low cost local labor. Local companies are stuck at the low-end of supply chains, struggling to access loans and markets that favored the 700-odd state-owned giants, from colonial-era beer factories with arched windows to unfashionable state-run shops that few customers bother to enter. “The private sector remains heavily constrained,"" said Nguyen Khac Giang of Singapore’s ISEAS–Yusof Ishak Institute. Again emulating China, Vietnam wants “national champions” to drive innovation and compete globally, not by picking winners, but by letting markets decide. The policy includes easier loans for companies investing in new technology, priority in government contracts for those meeting innovation goals, and help for firms looking to expand overseas. Even mega-projects like the North-South High-Speed Rail, once reserved for state-run giants, are now open to private bidding. By 2030, Vietnam hopes to elevate at least 20 private firms to a global scale. But Giang warned that there will be pushback from conservatives in the Communist Party and from those who benefit from state-owned firms. Even as political resistance threatens to stall reforms, climate threats require urgent action. After losing a major investor over flood risks, Bruno Jaspaert knew something had to change. His firm, DEEP C Industrial Zones, houses more than 150 factories across northern Vietnam. So it hired a consultancy to redesign flood resilience plans. Climate risk is becoming its own kind of market regulation, forcing businesses to plan better, build smarter, and adapt faster. “If the whole world will decide it’s a priority...it can go very fast,” said Jaspaert. When Typhoon Yagi hit last year, causing $1.6 billion in damage, knocking 0.15% off Vietnam’s GDP and battering factories that produce nearly half the country’s economic output, roads in DEEP C industrial parks stayed dry. Climate risks are no longer theoretical: If Vietnam doesn’t take strong action to adapt to and reduce climate change, the country could lose 12–14.5% of its GDP each year by 2050, and up to one million people could fall into extreme poverty by 2030, according to the World Bank. Meanwhile, Vietnam is growing old before it gets rich. The country’s “golden population” window — when working-age people outnumber dependents — will close by 2039 and the labor force is projected to peak just three years later. That could shrink productivity and strain social services, especially since families — and women in particular — are the default caregivers, said Teerawichitchainan Bussarawan of the Centre for Family and Population Research at the National University of Singapore. Vietnam is racing to pre-empt the fallout by expanding access to preventive healthcare so older adults remain healthier and more independent. Gradually raising the retirement age and drawing more women into the formal workforce would help offset labor gaps and promote ""healthy aging,” Bussarawan said. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

NFL and WWE Land on ESPN—The Impact on Disney and TKO Stocks,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/nfl-and-wwe-land-on-espnthe-impact-on-disney-and-tko-stocks/,"Do you smell what the Mouse is cooking? ESPN, one of the largest subsidiaries of The Walt Disney Company NYSE: DIS, announced major agreements last week with two of the world’s most prominent sports leagues: the National Football League (NFL) and World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). The deals mark a significant push by ESPN to bolster its live sports portfolio ahead of a critical streaming launch, underscoring the growing battle for premium sports rights in an increasingly crowded media landscape. The agreements bring high-value programming to ESPN’s new direct-to-consumer (DTC) streaming service, which is scheduled to launch before the start of the NFL and college football seasons. ESPN reached deep into its pockets to secure these deals, including surrendering a 10% equity stake to the NFL itself. For Disney, these moves come at a pivotal time as the company seeks to stabilize subscriber growth and solidify its position against rivals like Amazon Prime and Peacock, both of which have been aggressively chasing live sports content. But how beneficial are these new arrangements to parent companies Disney and TKO Group Holdings Inc. NYSE: TKO? Today, we’ll explore why these companies came together, their strategy moving forward, and how their stocks responded in the days following the announcements. For Disney, adding NFL and WWE programming to its new DTC streaming app was crucial for attracting customers who might be feeling tapped out over yet another monthly subscription. Launching August 21, the new ESPN streaming app will feature programming pillars like NFL Network, NFL Red Zone Channel, and WWE ‘Premium Live Events’ such as WrestleMania, the Royal Rumble, and SummerSlam. With an expected price of $29.99 per month (or $299.99 annually), this new ESPN DTC app needs to provide compelling value to consumers, and sporting events like NFL games and WWE specials remain one of the few areas of live TV where customers are willing to pay a premium. ESPN is planning to offer more than 47,000 live sporting events through this new streamer, with a cheaper option priced at $11.99 per month, featuring more targeted events like FCS-level college football, soccer, and tennis. The NFL and WWE boast two of the most passionate and dedicated fan bases on Earth, and adding these massive demographics will complement Disney’s network of streaming options like Disney+ and Hulu. The company plans to offer a variety of packages and bundles for its multi-pronged streaming attack, and the launch date isn’t a coincidence either—the FOX ONE sports app is also being released on August 21. The rights to these events didn’t come cheap, and both the NFL and WWE will have lucrative new revenue streams for signing over some control to ESPN. For the NFL, the agreement with ESPN comes with a 10% equity stake, which will allow the league to make sure the programming aligns with its mission and goals. It also means the NFL has a financial interest in the success of ESPN’s new streaming service, which means promotion across the NFL’s various media channels, live events, and outreach programs. An equity stake is a unique agreement between a league and a national programmer, and could finally mark a shift away from the traditional licensing models that have shown diminishing ROI. WWE (and its parent, TKO Holdings) receives $1.6 billion over five years in their deal, which includes ESPN paying $325 million per year for exclusive rights to stream marquee live events like WrestleMania. Formerly available on Pay-Per-View, WWE’s premium events currently air on NBC streamer Peacock, which has a lower price point but also less reach than the ESPN conglomerate. WWE and NBC agreed to a five-year deal worth just over $1 billion in 2021, but this time, NBC failed to match the $325 million ESPN was offering annually for the exclusive premium event rights. WWE not only gets lucrative revenue streams, but new partnership opportunities with ESPN’s cast of personalities, many of whom (such as College Gameday’s Pat McAfee) are already involved in pro wrestling. WWE’s weekly flagship program, Monday Night Raw, will continue to air on Netflix Inc. NASDAQ: NFLX through 2034. TKO shares have surged more than 15% in the week since the announcement, although some of that gain was due to the company’s new $7.7 billion UFC agreement with Paramount. The company’s Q2 earnings report, released after the August 6 close, also boosted confidence as revenue grew 53.7% year-over-year (YOY) to $1.31 billion, above the expected $1.23 billion. Thanks in part to these new licensing deals, the company boosted its full-year 2025 revenue guidance to $4.63 billion to $4.69 billion, the second straight quarter its raised guidance. Shares are also now trading above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, so technical and fundamental factors are beginning to align in TKO. For DIS shareholders, the latest foray into the streaming space is an expensive endeavor, and the company is counting on rabid fan bases paying higher rates for their favorite live programming. A $29.99 price point isn’t aimed at mass adoption; it's for dedicated sports fans. While offering the NFL Red Zone Channel, NFL Network, and WWE’s biggest shows is an impressive lineup, pushback from fans about the elevated price could dent the potential revenue boosts. Additionally, Disney risks cannibalizing some of its own growth if customers cancel Disney+ or Hulu to pay for the new app. So far, investors see more of a value proposition in TKO shares; DIS is down more than 2% over the last week and will likely need to demonstrate substantial subscriber numbers for its new DTC service to catch TKO’s gains.

"35 Union Pacific train cars derail near Texas town, no injuries reported",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/35-union-pacific-train-cars-derail-near-texas-town-no-injuries-reported-2025-08-12/,"GORDON, Texas (AP) — Thirty-five cars of a Union Pacific train derailed Tuesday afternoon near a small Texas town, officials said. No injuries were reported and no evacuations have been ordered following the afternoon derailment, Union Pacific spokeswoman Robynn Tysver said. News footage showed multiple train cars piled on top of one another on the railroad track located in a rural area. A grass fire and smoke could be seen beside the derailment site. The emergency services district said the derailment was being treated as a hazardous material situation. But it was not immediately known what the derailed train cars were carrying. The derailment occurred around 2 p.m. just east of the town of Gordon, Tysver said. Gordon is located about 65 miles (105 kilometers) southwest of Fort Worth. None of the railroad cars were leaking their contents, according to a post on social media by the Palo Pinto County Emergency Services District 1. “All personnel have been accounted for, and no injuries have been reported. The situation is currently stable, but not yet fully controlled,” the emergency services district said in a statement. Some small grass fires were reported following the derailment. “Fire officials are actively working to contain and extinguish them, and no structures are currently threatened,” the statement added. The Palo Pinto Fire Department was working to contain a grass fire, Tysver said. “Union Pacific crews are en route,” Tysver added.","No injuries were reported and no evacuations have been ordered following the afternoon derailment, Union Pacific spokeswoman Robynn Tysver said.","GORDON, Texas (AP) — Thirty-five cars of a Union Pacific train derailed Tuesday afternoon near a small Texas town, officials said.",But it was not immediately known what the derailed train cars were carrying.,"None of the railroad cars were leaking their contents, according to a post on social media by the Palo Pinto County Emergency Services District 1."
"VA hospitals are finding it harder to fill jobs, watchdog says",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/va-hospitals-are-finding-it-harder-to-fill-jobs-watchdog-says-2025-08-12/,"NORFOLK, Va. (AP) — Government-run medical centers serving the nation's veterans have reported an increase in severe staffing shortages, with many hospitals having trouble filling jobs for doctors, nurses and psychologists, according to an independent watchdog for the Department of Veterans Affairs. Tuesday's report from the VA's Office of Inspector General is based on surveys from late March and early April that were taken at 139 Veterans Health Administration facilities. Severe staffing shortages are not necessarily an indication of vacancies but refer to particular occupations that are difficult to fill. The surveys were taken just weeks after it was reported in early March that the VA had planned to cut 80,000 jobs — out of 484,000 — through the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE. The VA later reduced the figure to nearly 30,000 jobs to be cut by this fiscal year’s end on Sept. 30. President Donald Trump's administration said Tuesday that the surveys are unreliable because they do not reflect actual vacancies, which VA officials said were in line with historical averages. But Democratic lawmakers warned that veterans won't get the health care they need as VA positions become harder to fill. The surveys reflected a 50% increase in the reporting of severe staffing shortages for specific jobs, both for clinical occupations that include doctors and psychologists and for non-clinical jobs that include police and custodial workers. Nearly all of the facilities — 94% — reported a shortage for medical officer occupations that include doctors, while 79% reported shortages for nurses. The report noted that severe shortages for medical officers and nurses have been identified every year in the report since 2014. Pete Kasperowicz, the VA's press secretary, stressed in an email that the report is not based on vacancies and is therefore “not a reliable indicator of staffing shortages.” “The report simply lists occupations facilities feel are difficult for which to recruit and retain, so the results are completely subjective, not standardized and unreliable,” Kasperowicz wrote. He said that vacancy rates for doctors and nurses are 14% and 10%, respectively, which he said are lower than most other health care systems and in line with “normal VA historical averages.” But Jacqueline Simon, policy director for the American Federation of Government Employees, said the surveys reflect the Trump administration's profound hostility toward the federal workforce and what she said are its plans to ultimately privatize the VA. “This is a deliberate effort to incapacitate and to undermine veterans' support for and approval of the care they receive in VA hospitals and clinics,” Simon said. “They’ll have to wait much longer for appointments. There won’t be specialists available. They’ll have no choice but to go to the private sector.” Simon also noted the VA’s announcement last week that it was terminating collective bargaining agreements for most VA bargaining-unit employees, which could further hurt recruitment. The VA said in a news release that the move will “make it easier for VA leaders to promote high-performing employees, hold poor performers accountable, and improve benefits and services to America’s Veterans.” But U.S. Sen. Mark Warner said in a news release Tuesday that the Trump administration has made it harder for public servants to do their jobs “and ultimately harder for veterans to get the care they’ve earned.” “We also know from recent jobs reports that applications to work at the VA are plummeting,"" said Warner, a Democrat who represents the veteran-dense state of Virginia. “How do skyrocketing staffing shortages and declining applicant pools make it more ‘efficient’ for veterans to access the care and services they deserve? The answer is: they don’t.”","The VA said in a news release that the move will “make it easier for VA leaders to promote high-performing employees, hold poor performers accountable, and improve benefits and services to America’s Veterans.” But U.S. Sen.

"Trump's nominee to oversee jobs, inflation data faces shower of criticism",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trumps-nominee-to-oversee-jobs-inflation-data-faces-shower-of-criticism-2025-08-12/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The director of the agency that produces the nation's jobs and inflation data is typically a mild-mannered technocrat, often with extensive experience in statistical agencies, with little public profile. But like so much in President Donald Trump's second administration, this time is different. Trump has selected E.J. Antoni, chief economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation, to be the next commissioner at the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics. Antoni's nomination was quickly met with a cascade of criticism from other economists, from across the political spectrum. His selection threatens to bring a new level of politicization to what for decades has been a nonpartisan agency widely accepted as a producer of reliable measures of the nation's economic health. While many former Labor Department officials say it it unlikely Antoni will be able to distort or alter the data, particularly in the short run, he could change the currently dry-as-dust way it is presented. Antoni was nominated by Trump after the BLS released a jobs report Aug. 1 that showed that hiring had weakened in July and was much lower in May and June than the agency had previously reported. Trump, without evidence, charged that the data had been “rigged” for political reasons and fired the then-BLS chair, Erika McEntarfer, much to the dismay of many within the agency. Antoni has been a vocal critic of the government’s jobs data in frequent appearances on podcasts and cable TV. His partisan commentary is unusual for someone who may end up leading the BLS. For instance, on Aug. 4 — a week before he was nominated — Antoni said in an interview on Fox News Digital that the Labor Department should stop publishing the monthly jobs reports until its data collection processes improve, and rely on quarterly data based on actual employment filings with state unemployment offices. The monthly employment reports are probably the closest-watched economic data on Wall Street, and can frequently cause swings in stock prices. When asked at Tuesday’s White House briefing whether the jobs report would continue to be released, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the administration hoped it would be. “I believe that is the plan and that’s the hope,” Leavitt said. Leavitt also defended Antoni's nomination, calling him an “economic expert” who has testified before Congress and adding that, “the president trusts him to lead this important department.” Yet Antoni’s TV and podcast appearances have created more of a portrait of a conservative ideologue, instead of a careful economist who considers tradeoffs and prioritizes getting the math correct. “There’s just nothing in his writing or his resume to suggest that he’s qualified for the position, besides that he is always manipulating the data to favor Trump in some way,” said Brian Albrecht, chief economist at the International Center for Law and Economics. Antoni wrongly claimed in the last year of Biden's presidency that the economy had been in recession since 2022; called on the entire Federal Reserve board to be fired for not earning a profit on its Treasury securities holdings; and posted a chart on social media that conflated timelines to suggest inflation was headed to 15%. His argument that the U.S. was in a recession rested on a vastly exaggerated measure of housing inflation, based on newly-purchased home prices, to artificially make the nation’s gross domestic product appear smaller than it was. “This is actually maybe the worst Antoni content I’ve seen yet,” Alan Cole of the center-right Tax Foundation said on social media, referring to his recession claim. On a 2024 podcast, Antoni wanted to sunset Social Security payments for workers paying into the system, saying that “you’ll need a generation of people who pay Social Security taxes but never actually receive any of those benefits.” As head of the BLS, Antoni would oversee the release of the consumer price index by which Social Security payments are adjusted for inflation. Many economists share, to some degree, Antoni's concerns that the government's jobs data has flaws and is threatened by trends such as declining response rates to its surveys. The drop has made the jobs figures more volatile, though not necessarily less accurate over time. “The stock market moves clearly based on these job numbers, and so people with skin in the game think it’s telling them something about the future of their investments,” Albrecht said. “Could it be improved? Absolutely.” Katharine Abraham, an economist at the University of Maryland who was BLS Commissioner under President Bill Clinton, said updating the jobs report's methods would require at least some initial investment. The government could use more modern data sources, she said, such as figures from payroll processing companies, and fill in gaps with surveys. “There’s an inconsistency between saying you want higher response rates and you want to spend less money,” she said, referring to the administration's proposals to cut BLS funding. Still, Abraham and other former BLS commissioners don't think Antoni, if confirmed, would be able to alter the figures. He could push for changes in the monthly press release and seek to portray the numbers in a more positive light. William Beach, who was appointed BLS commissioner by Trump in his first term and also served under Biden, said he is confident that BLS procedures are strong enough to prevent political meddling. He said he didn't see the figures himself until two days before publication when he served as commissioner. “The commissioner does not affect the numbers,’’ Beach said. “They don’t collect the data. They don’t massage the data. They don’t organize it."" Regarding the odds of rigging the numbers, Beach said, “I wouldn’t put it at complete zero, but I’d put it pretty close to zero.’’ It took about six months after McEntarfer was nominated in July 2023 for her to be approved. Antoni will likely face stiff opposition from Democrats, but that may not be enough to derail his appointment. Sen. Patty Murray, a senior Democrat from Washington, on Tuesday slammed Antoni as “an unqualified right-wing extremist” and demanded that the GOP chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, hold a confirmation hearing for him. ___ Associated Press Staff Writers Paul Wiseman and Stephen Groves contributed to this story.",Antoni wrongly claimed in the last year of Biden's presidency that the economy had been in recession since 2022; called on the entire Federal Reserve board to be fired for not earning a profit on its Treasury securities holdings; and posted a chart on social media that conflated timelines to suggest inflation was headed to 15%.,"On a 2024 podcast, Antoni wanted to sunset Social Security payments for workers paying into the system, saying that “you’ll need a generation of people who pay Social Security taxes but never actually receive any of those benefits.” As head of the BLS, Antoni would oversee the release of the consumer price index by which Social Security payments are adjusted for inflation.","The government could use more modern data sources, she said, such as figures from payroll processing companies, and fill in gaps with surveys.","On a 2024 podcast, Antoni wanted to sunset Social Security payments for workers paying into the system, saying that “you’ll need a generation of people who pay Social Security taxes but never actually receive any of those benefits.” As head of the BLS, Antoni would oversee the release of the consumer price index by which Social Security payments are adjusted for inflation."
Police in Southern California find $30K worth of Labubus stolen from warehouse,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/police-in-southern-california-find-30k-worth-of-labubus-stolen-from-warehouse-2025-08-12/,"CHINO, Calif. (AP) — A police department in Southern California recovered about $30,000 worth of Labubu dolls that were stolen from a warehouse, the agency announced this week. The collectible items have recently surged in popularity. The Labubus were stolen in a series of trips that spanned multiple days, the Chino Police Department said in a social media post. Two suspects, both minors, were later identified as workers at the warehouse, the department said. Law enforcement found the items at a home in Upland, a city in the state's Inland Empire. The announcement comes as authorities in Los Angeles County investigate a separate incident in which thieves stole about $7,000 worth of the toothy little monsters from a store in La Puente. Chino Police obtained a search warrant to enter the home in Upland, the agency said. One suspect attempted to flee but later surrendered, the department said. The other was apprehended in a nearby city Tuesday, days after detectives searched the home, police said. Both were booked in San Bernardino County juvenile hall for suspected burglary and conspiracy to commit burglary. Detectives found 14 boxes of stolen items and evidence indicating the suspects were planning to resell and ship the collectibles across the country, the department said. The Labubu, created by Hong Kong-born artist Kasing Lung, was first introduced in 2015 and is sold by China's Pop Mart.","Chino Police obtained a search warrant to enter the home in Upland, the agency said.","CHINO, Calif.

ExxonMobil signs deal to explore for oil and gas near Trinidad despite criticism,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/exxonmobil-signs-deal-to-explore-for-oil-and-gas-near-trinidad-despite-criticism-2025-08-12/,"PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) — ExxonMobil signed a deal on Tuesday to explore a vast area near Trinidad and Tobago for oil and gas, even as the twin-island nation faces pressure to focus more on green energy deals. The search will take place off Trinidad’s east coast, in a region that spans more than 2,700 square miles (7,000 square kilometers) and is more than 6,500 feet (2,000 meters) deep, according to government officials. The deal was signed following six months of negotiations that were held at a record pace, said John Ardill, ExxonMobil’s vice president of global exploration. There are “no guarantees of success,” Ardill cautioned during the ceremony. “But many of the largest discoveries and developments in the world are occurring in deep-water environments similar to what you have here.” Ardill said ExxonMobil is committed to starting a geophysical survey in the next six months to collect data needed to identify prospects for oil and gas, after which, it will begin drilling for testing. Using nearby Guyana as an example, Ardill said it took the country less than five years to start producing oil after the initial discovery. He noted that 10 years after that discovery, Guyana is currently producing around 650,000 barrels of oil per day. “We see great potential to replicate the Guyana success here,” Ardill told the audience in Trinidad. While promising to help expedite the process, Trinidad and Tobago’s Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar said the necessary oversight and guardrails will be in place to ensure standards are not compromised. The prime minister said the agreement with ExxonMobil provides additional energy security for the Caribbean nation of approximately 1.4 million people. She noted that while there would be efforts to reduce carbon emissions during the project, Trinidad and Tobago would not hold back on using its energy resources. “The Northern Hemisphere developed their countries to the fullest and are now trying to put on us that we should clamp down on our carbon emissions, (that) we should look not too much to hydrocarbons,” Persad-Bissessar said. “Trinidad and Tobago has a competitive advantage when it comes to hydrocarbons, when it comes to the energy sector, and we should not lightly surrender that.” ExxonMobil first began operations in the twin-island republic in February 1998, but left in 2003 after its exploration efforts were unsuccessful. The ExxonMobil deal comes after a planned energy production partnership involving Trinidad and Tobago and neighboring Venezuela was halted by the U.S. government revoking two Office of Foreign Assets Control licenses for the partnership. The licenses were necessary due to U.S. sanctions against Venezuela’s energy industry. ___ This story corrects the depth of the area to be explored to 6,500 feet (2,000 meters).","“Trinidad and Tobago has a competitive advantage when it comes to hydrocarbons, when it comes to the energy sector, and we should not lightly surrender that.” ExxonMobil first began operations in the twin-island republic in February 1998, but left in 2003 after its exploration efforts were unsuccessful.","“Trinidad and Tobago has a competitive advantage when it comes to hydrocarbons, when it comes to the energy sector, and we should not lightly surrender that.” ExxonMobil first began operations in the twin-island republic in February 1998, but left in 2003 after its exploration efforts were unsuccessful.","PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) — ExxonMobil signed a deal on Tuesday to explore a vast area near Trinidad and Tobago for oil and gas, even as the twin-island nation faces pressure to focus more on green energy deals.","“But many of the largest discoveries and developments in the world are occurring in deep-water environments similar to what you have here.” Ardill said ExxonMobil is committed to starting a geophysical survey in the next six months to collect data needed to identify prospects for oil and gas, after which, it will begin drilling for testing."

"If Qualcomm Holds $145, Its Next Move Could Be Massive",https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/if-qualcomm-holds-145-its-next-move-could-be-massive/,"Tech giant Qualcomm Inc. NASDAQ: QCOM has once again been testing the patience of even its most loyal investors. Despite consistently beating earnings expectations, operating in one of the market's hottest sectors, and trading against the backdrop of record-high equity indices, the stock still can’t break free. It’s now down 3% for the year, while the S&P 500 has gained more than 8% and market-leader NVIDIA Corp. NASDAQ: NVDA is up a blistering 35%. The latest 10% drop to close out July broke the steady uptrend in place since spring, raising questions for long-term holders about the stock’s next move. Yet for those on the sidelines, the recent weakness could be setting up an attractive entry point. It does not necessarily demand a multi-year holding period but is undoubtedly a short-to-medium term trade worth considering. The first thing worth noting is that Qualcomm’s underlying performance remains solid beneath the frustrating price action. Management has moved past concerns about losing business from Apple Inc. NASDAQ: AAPL, which is shifting more production in-house. The company continues to demonstrate resilience in core markets like mobile and automotive. The semiconductor sector itself is still firing on all cylinders. Consider the iShares Semiconductor ETF NASDAQ: SOXX, in which Qualcomm is the fifth-largest holding. It’s up more than 50% since April, underscoring Wall Street’s belief in the growth potential of semiconductors. Against that backdrop, Qualcomm’s underperformance looks more and more like an anomaly than a warning sign. Then there’s the valuation. With a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 14, Qualcomm trades at a steep discount to both the broader market and sector peers, many of whom have P/E ratios in the triple digits. In an increasingly frothy market, this offers a rare opportunity to buy a proven business at a bargain multiple. A wall of recent analyst support strengthens the bullish case. Piper Sandler, Mizuho, Rosenblatt, and JPMorgan have all reiterated Buy or equivalent ratings within the past two weeks, with price targets running as high as $225. Qualcomm closed out Monday’s session below $150, which implies some very tempting upside potential in the region of 50%. Then there’s the technical setup, wherein lies this short-term opportunity. Despite sliding sharply since late July and staying down, Qualcomm shares have been unable to set a new low since last Wednesday. That suggests selling pressure is starting to fade, and the bears could soon be under pressure. It’s worth noting that Qualcomm’s struggles aren’t being driven by a deterioration in its business, which makes this the kind of setup where short-term traders can find outsized gains. If the stock can remain above the $145 level through the rest of this week and then reclaim $150, it should spark a reversal that sends it back toward the $160 mark and beyond. Of course, there are reasons Qualcomm is seen as one of the more frustrating tech stocks to own. Its tendency to lag in strong markets has tested investors’ patience for years, and the latest breakdown of its uptrend is another example. Momentum traders will want a clean break back above $150 before committing, while longer-term investors may wait for proof that operational wins can translate into sustained stock performance. Still, the risk-reward is compelling. A 14 P/E, strong analyst backing, and exposure to a sector leading the market higher all year make Qualcomm a diamond in the rough. The next move could be sharply higher if the bears fail to push it to new lows in the coming sessions. Before you consider QUALCOMM, you'll want to hear this.","It’s up more than 50% since April, underscoring Wall Street’s belief in the growth potential of semiconductors.","It’s worth noting that Qualcomm’s struggles aren’t being driven by a deterioration in its business, which makes this the kind of setup where short-term traders can find outsized gains.","Momentum traders will want a clean break back above $150 before committing, while longer-term investors may wait for proof that operational wins can translate into sustained stock performance.","If the stock can remain above the $145 level through the rest of this week and then reclaim $150, it should spark a reversal that sends it back toward the $160 mark and beyond."
Intel's White House Reset: From Political Storm to a Clearer Sky,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/intels-white-house-reset-from-political-storm-to-a-clearer-sky/,"A multi-day rally for Intel Corporation NASDAQ: INTC this week has pushed shares back toward the $22 level, with a surge of over 5% on August 11 that continued to August 12. This newfound momentum in Intel’s stock price was not driven by a new product or an earnings beat. Instead, it was fueled by the successful resolution of a significant political uncertainty that had created an overhang on the stock. Just days after facing high-level scrutiny from Washington, Intel’s CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, engaged in a direct meeting at the White House that resulted in a public de-escalation of tensions. This rapid and decisive action has cleared a significant hurdle for the company, allowing investors to refocus on the core fundamentals of Intel’s ongoing turnaround with renewed confidence in its strategic alignment with U.S. policy. For investors, understanding the importance of Intel's relationship with the U.S. government is critical to understanding the potential of the company. Intel’s ambitious and capital-intensive turnaround is fundamentally linked to its role as a key domestic manufacturing partner. The company was awarded nearly $8 billion in grants from the CHIPS and Science Act, the largest award to a single company. This funding is essential for building the advanced factories, or fabs, that are at the heart of its plan to regain technology leadership from international rivals like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company NYSE: TSM. Any significant misalignment with the administration's America First manufacturing agenda could have jeopardized this crucial financial and strategic support. Furthermore, leadership stability is one of the most critical requirements during a complex corporate overhaul. With CEO Lip-Bu Tan actively executing a deep restructuring (including a 15% workforce reduction and a pivot in the company's manufacturing roadmap), the recent public scrutiny of his position posed a direct risk to the consistent execution of this long-term strategy. In an age of intense global focus on supply chain security, Intel’s value proposition depends heavily on its status as a trusted, U.S.-based manufacturer. Reaffirming a constructive partnership with Washington was therefore not just a matter of public relations, but a core business imperative. The pivotal event was a ""candid and constructive discussion"" at the White House between CEO Lip-Bu Tan and the President. The outcome was a de-escalation, with the administration publicly praising Tan's ""amazing story"" and Intel releasing a statement reaffirming its commitment to U.S. tech sector leadership. More importantly, the meeting established a path for future collaboration, with plans for follow-up discussions between the CEO and key cabinet members. This transforms the relationship from one of scrutiny to one of active partnership. This renewed alignment appears to come with a tangible competitive advantage. Competitors like NVIDIA NASDAQ: NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ: AMD are reportedly subject to a revenue-sharing agreement with the U.S. government, estimated to be around 15%, on certain high-performance AI chip sales to China. Intel's Gaudi AI accelerators are not currently subject to this same requirement. For investors, this should be seen as a significant development. It provides Intel with a distinct edge in a key global market, allowing the company to either achieve higher effective margins on its AI hardware or pass those savings on to customers to be even more price-competitive against its rivals. The market's strong, positive reaction to these developments is a logical de-risking event. By successfully navigating this high-stakes test, Intel's management has removed a major, unpredictable uncertainty that was weighing on the stock. Analyst commentary following the meeting reflected this sentiment, with firms like Bernstein calling the resolution a ""clear positive."" This stability now allows the investment narrative to shift back to the company's fundamental progress in its strategic execution, which remains compelling. Investors can now refocus on the tangible proof points of the turnaround that were highlighted in Intel’s most recent earnings report. This includes the strong Q3 guidance for a sequential gross margin recovery, the overwhelmingly positive critical reception of the new Lunar Lake processors, and the long-term growth potential of the foundry business, which has been validated by major customer wins. By reaffirming its strategic importance to the U.S. government, Intel has not just returned to its prior standing; it has arguably strengthened its position, reinforcing the long-term investment thesis for a great American company on the path to recovery.

"Crypto mogul Do Kwon, known as 'the cryptocurrency king,' pleads guilty to fraud charges",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/crypto-mogul-do-kwon-known-as-the-cryptocurrency-king-pleads-guilty-to-fraud-charges-2025-08-12/,"NEW YORK (AP) — South Korean cryptocurrency mogul Do Kwon pleaded guilty on Tuesday to two fraud charges arising from the $40 billion collapse of a cryptocurrency ecosystem that had promised investors their money was safe. Kwon, 33, dubbed by some as “the cryptocurrency king,” entered the plea in Manhattan federal court. According to a plea agreement signed by Kwon and prosecutors, the government said it will not seek a prison term of more than 12 years as long as Kwon complies with the deal's terms, even though federal sentencing guidelines would have recommended a prison term of about 25 years. Sentencing is set for Dec. 11. Authorities said investors worldwide lost money in the Singapore crypto firm Terraform Labs’ $40 billion cryptocurrency crash. Kwon co-founded the company in 2018. The May 2022 collapse came after the company claimed that TerraUSD was a reliable “stablecoin.” TerraUSD was designed as a “stablecoin,” a currency that is pegged to stable assets such as the dollar to prevent drastic fluctuations in prices. However, around $40 billion in market value was erased for the holders of TerraUSD and its floating sister currency, Luna, after the stablecoin plunged far below its $1 peg. Kwon was extradited to the United States on Dec. 31 from Montenegro after his March 23, 2023, arrest while traveling on a false passport in Europe. As part of his plea to one count of conspiring to commit commodities fraud, securities fraud and wire fraud and a second count of wire fraud, Kwon also agreed to forfeit over $19 million, an amount that authorities said reflected ill-gotten proceeds. He'll also lose his interest in Terraform and its cryptocurrencies. His lawyer, Sean Hecker, said the plea meant that Kwon had accepted responsibility for making false and misleading statements to investors. In a statement, the lawyer said his client ""takes responsibility for misleading the Terra community.” In a news release, U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton said Kwon “used the technological promise and investment euphoria around cryptocurrency to commit one of the largest frauds in history.” He said investors around the world suffered billions of dollars in losses.",NEW YORK (AP) — South Korean cryptocurrency mogul Do Kwon pleaded guilty on Tuesday to two fraud charges arising from the $40 billion collapse of a cryptocurrency ecosystem that had promised investors their money was safe.,"As part of his plea to one count of conspiring to commit commodities fraud, securities fraud and wire fraud and a second count of wire fraud, Kwon also agreed to forfeit over $19 million, an amount that authorities said reflected ill-gotten proceeds.","His lawyer, Sean Hecker, said the plea meant that Kwon had accepted responsibility for making false and misleading statements to investors.","In a statement, the lawyer said his client ""takes responsibility for misleading the Terra community.” In a news release, U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton said Kwon “used the technological promise and investment euphoria around cryptocurrency to commit one of the largest frauds in history.” He said investors around the world suffered billions of dollars in losses."
"US national debt reaches a record $37 trillion, the Treasury Department reports",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/us-national-debt-reaches-a-record-37-trillion-the-treasury-department-reports-2025-08-12/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. government’s gross national debt has surpassed $37 trillion, a record number that highlights the accelerating debt on America’s balance sheet and increased cost pressures on taxpayers. The $37 trillion update is found in the latest Treasury Department report issued Tuesday which logs the nation's daily finances. The national debt eclipsed $37 trillion years sooner than pre-pandemic projections. The Congressional Budget Office’s January 2020 projections had gross federal debt eclipsing $37 trillion after fiscal year 2030. But the debt grew faster than expected because of a multi-year COVID-19 pandemic starting in 2020 that shut down much of the U.S. economy, where the federal government borrowed heavily under then-President Donald Trump and former President Joe Biden to stabilize the national economy and support a recovery. And now, more government spending has been approved after Trump signed into law Republicans' tax cut and spending legislation earlier this year. The law set to add $4.1 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates. Chair and CEO of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, Michael Peterson said in a statement that government borrowing puts upward pressure on interest rates, “adding costs for everyone and reducing private sector investment. Within the federal budget, the debt crowds out important priorities and creates a damaging cycle of more borrowing, more interest costs, and even more borrowing.” Wendy Edelberg, a senior fellow in Economic Studies at the Brookings Institution said Congress has a major role in setting in motion spending and revenue policy and the result of the Republicans' tax law ""means that we’re going to borrow a lot over the course of 2026, we’re going to borrow a lot over the course of 2027, and it’s just going to keep going."" The Government Accountability Office outlines some of the impacts of rising government debt on Americans — including higher borrowing costs for things like mortgages and cars, lower wages from businesses having less money available to invest, and more expensive goods and services. Peterson points out how the trillion-dollar milestones are “piling up at a rapid rate.” The U.S. hit $34 trillion in debt in January 2024, $35 trillion in July 2024 and $36 trillion in November 2024. “We are now adding a trillion more to the national debt every 5 months,"" Peterson said. ""That’s more than twice as fast as the average rate over the last 25 years.” The Joint Economic Committee estimates at the current average daily rate of growth an increase of another trillion dollars to the debt would be reached in approximately 173 days. Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget said in a statement that “hopefully this milestone is enough to wake up policymakers to the reality that we need to do something, and we need to do it quickly.”",The Congressional Budget Office’s January 2020 projections had gross federal debt eclipsing $37 trillion after fiscal year 2030.,"Within the federal budget, the debt crowds out important priorities and creates a damaging cycle of more borrowing, more interest costs, and even more borrowing.” Wendy Edelberg, a senior fellow in Economic Studies at the Brookings Institution said Congress has a major role in setting in motion spending and revenue policy and the result of the Republicans' tax law ""means that we’re going to borrow a lot over the course of 2026, we’re going to borrow a lot over the course of 2027, and it’s just going to keep going.""",The Congressional Budget Office’s January 2020 projections had gross federal debt eclipsing $37 trillion after fiscal year 2030.,"Within the federal budget, the debt crowds out important priorities and creates a damaging cycle of more borrowing, more interest costs, and even more borrowing.” Wendy Edelberg, a senior fellow in Economic Studies at the Brookings Institution said Congress has a major role in setting in motion spending and revenue policy and the result of the Republicans' tax law ""means that we’re going to borrow a lot over the course of 2026, we’re going to borrow a lot over the course of 2027, and it’s just going to keep going."""
‘Crazy!!’: How Labor Statistics staff reacted to Trump firing commissioner after dismal jobs report,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/crazy-how-labor-statistics-staff-reacted-to-trump-firing-commissioner-after-dismal-jobs-report-2025-08-12/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — “Depressing.” “CRAZY!!” That's how staff at the Bureau of Labor Statistics reacted after President Donald Trump fired its commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, after a dismal jobs report issued Aug. 1 undermined the White House's claims of an economic boom. The emails obtained by The Associated Press under the Freedom of Information Act suggest an agency with little of the corrupting partisanship that Trump had claimed. He called the report “phony” and “rigged” after it indicated a paltry 73,000 jobs were added in July and after downward revisions that showed 258,000 fewer jobs were added in May and June than previously reported. After the commissioner's firing, BLS employees talked about the importance of accurate numbers and professional integrity in producing data that is foundational for measuring the economy and holding elected officials accountable for how the nation performs. Officials at the agency sought to rally morale by focusing on their task at hand at a time when outside economists wondered if Trump had compromised the credibility of reports on jobs, inflation and other key economic indicators. The president has said without evidence that the numbers were meant to make him and other Republicans look bad — his latest effort to interfere with the functions of executive branch agencies, including the Federal Reserve. “This news is sudden, but our mission is unchanged — to provide high quality data to the nation,” William Wiatrowski, the acting commissioner, told the staff in an email. “Thank you for all the good work you do.” One assistant commissioner told staff to persevere just as a ship's crew might after losing its captain. “We may have lost our captain but the ship will not go down,” the assistant commissioner wrote. “We will neither hit an iceberg and sink to the ocean floor, nor run aground on a low-lying shoal. We are not rudderless. We remain ... guided by our mission to provide gold-standard statistics the public can trust.” For her part, McEntarfer stayed stoic in her email to staff, choosing not to dwell on her firing by the president. Instead, she thanked BLS employees for the importance of their work. ""Our data moves markets because it is some of the most timely and accurate information on economic conditions that businesses and policymakers have,"" she wrote. “BLS data impacts the decisions of the Fed, the President, Congress, and millions of businesses and households. The work of this agency is vital to the US economy.” The White House maintains that McEntarfer was removed because the size of the revisions suggested that the monthly jobs report was flawed. As part of each jobs report, the BLS revises the prior months' data two times. It also issues an annual benchmark revision after getting more complete survey information, an effort that is meant to balance being timely with being accurate. Trump announced Monday that he would nominate E.J. Antoni, chief economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation, to lead the BLS. Antoni told Fox News Digital in an interview before the announcement that the BLS “should suspend issuing the monthly job reports” because of inaccuracies and offer quarterly updates instead. When asked at Tuesday's White House briefing whether the monthly jobs report would continue to be released, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the administration hoped it would be. “I believe that is the plan and that’s the hope,” Leavitt said.","!” That's how staff at the Bureau of Labor Statistics reacted after President Donald Trump fired its commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, after a dismal jobs report issued Aug. 1 undermined the White House's claims of an economic boom.",The work of this agency is vital to the US economy.” The White House maintains that McEntarfer was removed because the size of the revisions suggested that the monthly jobs report was flawed.,"“We will neither hit an iceberg and sink to the ocean floor, nor run aground on a low-lying shoal.",The work of this agency is vital to the US economy.” The White House maintains that McEntarfer was removed because the size of the revisions suggested that the monthly jobs report was flawed.

Uber’s $20B Buyback Could Spark a Trend—2 Stocks Already on Board,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/ubers-20b-buyback-could-spark-a-trend2-stocks-already-on-board/,"Uber Technologies NYSE: UBER, the world’s leader in ride-sharing, just announced financial results that elicited a mixed reaction from market participants. However, Uber left no room for interpretation regarding its feelings. The company announced a new $20 billion buyback authorization, showing that it is confident in its future positioning. This buyback program equals 10.7% of Uber’s market capitalization as of the Aug. 8 close. Let’s dive into the company’s latest results to understand why it has undertaken this massive repurchase plan. We’ll also look at two other notable stocks that have increased the size of their buyback chests. In Q2, Uber’s results were solid. Revenue increased by 18% to $12.65 billion, surpassing Wall Street expectations by nearly $200 million. The company’s adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 62 cents also beat expectations by 2 cents. Uber forecasted strong growth in Q3 of between 17% and 21%. Still, shares rose less than 0.2% on Aug. 6 due to the print. However, MarketBeat tracked around half a dozen analysts who boosted their price target on Aug. 7. Among analysts who issued updates, their price target on Uber rose by an average of just under $4. Although this number signals only a slightly higher confidence in Uber from analysts, the company’s $20 billion buyback plans signal that Uber's confidence in itself has increased substantially. One of the key factors in making this decision was Uber’s robust free cash flow (FCF) generation. Uber’s last-12-month FCF hit an all-time high of $8.5 billion. Uber raked in $2.5 billion in Q2 alone, an increase of nearly 44% year-over-year. This marked the eighth time out of the last nine quarters that Uber’s FCF growth met or exceeded this level. For most of the company’s history, its FCF has been negative. In conjunction with this, the company rarely engaged in share buybacks. However, now that the firm has grown into somewhat of a cash cow, it is able to confidently spend that money on buybacks. In its earnings call, Uber stated, “at least half of our cash flow generation over the coming years will go to share repurchases."" Thus, if Uber continues to bring in cash, investors should expect to get rewarded with buybacks. Like Uber, entertainment stock Roku NASDAQ: ROKU reported Q2 results that beat estimates but led to a sell-off. Due to the firm's financials, shares fell 15% on Aug. 1. Roku also authorized a $400 million buyback program. That equals around 3.3% of the company’s market cap as of the Aug. 8 close, a solid figure for a new buyback initiative. The company also specifically cited its FCF as a reason for this decision. Roku’s last 12 months FCF increased by 23% compared to Q2 2024. Throughout the company’s history, it has only spent a total of around $169 million on buybacks. This illustrates how substantial the firm’s new authorization is, being equal to over twice its total buyback spending since going public. Last up is London Stock Exchange Group LON: LSEG. This approximately $70 billion company is a massive player in capital markets, particularly in Europe. LSEG is one of the key providers of consensus earnings estimates, aggregating analyst forecasts worldwide. Based on USD/GBP exchange rates on June 30, the company plans to spend around $1.37 billion on buybacks in the second half of 2025. This is equal to just under 2% of its market capitalization. Although this is not a massive percentage, the company's plan to execute it in just half a year is substantial. On LSEG’s earnings call, an analyst noted that this would be the largest buyback the company has ever executed over that time frame. Overall, investors should see these buyback announcements as positive signs for the three companies above. That is particularly true for Uber, which has now posted positive FCF for ten quarters in a row. The new authorization signals that Uber believes this will continue and wants to make buybacks a staple of its capital allocation policy. Before you consider Uber Technologies, you'll want to hear this.",Roku also authorized a $400 million buyback program.,"Although this number signals only a slightly higher confidence in Uber from analysts, the company’s $20 billion buyback plans signal that Uber's confidence in itself has increased substantially.","In its earnings call, Uber stated, “at least half of our cash flow generation over the coming years will go to share repurchases.""","Although this number signals only a slightly higher confidence in Uber from analysts, the company’s $20 billion buyback plans signal that Uber's confidence in itself has increased substantially."
Brutal 2025 for Sarepta—Analysts Still Call for 179% Upside,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/brutal-2025-for-sareptaanalysts-still-call-for-179-upside/,"For Sarepta Therapeutics NASDAQ: SRPT, 2025 has been nothing short of an unmitigated disaster. The firm owns the only Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved gene therapy for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), known as ELEVIDYS. Since gaining approval in June 2023, Sarepta has generated over $1 billion in revenue from ELEVIDYS. However, that success has been massively overshadowed by key failures. In 2025, multiple people treated with ELEVIDYS have died, causing shares to plunge. Overall, Sarepta shares are down by more than 85% in 2025, as of the Aug. 11 close. However, multiple Wall Street analysts seem to believe a huge recovery could be in store for Sarepta. That is particularly true for analysts at Wells Fargo and BMO Capital Markets. Their $50 price targets indicate that shares could nearly triple in value. As of the Aug. 11 close, these targets imply around 179% upside in Sarepta stock. Below, we’ll detail Sarepta’s journey in 2025, as well as the bull and bear arguments around the stock. As of June 16, investigators found that two ELEVIDYS patients had died from acute liver failure (ALF). Then, on July 18, the FDA requested that Sarepta stop all shipments of ELEVIDYS, causing shares to fall 36%. This came after two additional deaths linked to Sarepta treatments. One patient received ELEVIDYS, while another received a different investigational drug with similar properties. On July 22, Sarepta complied with the request. Previously, Sarepta had only stopped selling ELEVIDYS to non-ambulatory patients. However, on July 28, the FDA reversed this request. They concluded that the death of the third patient treated with ELEVIDYS was “deemed unlikely to be related” to the drug. Sarepta then decided to resume ELEVIDYS sales to ambulatory patients. This is notable, as ambulatory patients make up approximately 70% to 85% of ELEVIDYS patients. Sarepta says this patient group alone allows the company to be profitable. Since the reversal of the FDA’s request, Sarepta shares are up 50% as of the Aug. 11 close. This demonstrates the improving sentiment around the stock, now that the company can continue generating revenue from ELEVIDYS. Sarepta started 2025 with a market capitalization of approximately $11.61 billion. As of the Aug. 11 close, that number has fallen to $1.75 billion. For a stock that has lost so much value in such a short period, it’s not overly surprising to see some analysts predicting massive upside in shares. Despite the turmoil surrounding ELEVIDYS, it is important to note that Sarepta has large revenue streams outside of it. In fiscal 2024, 54% of the company’s net product revenue came from products other than ELEVIDYS. Although the growth outlook for Sarepta has weakened significantly, the stock now trades at a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of just 1.2x. This compares to a median forward P/S ratio of around 4.3x among U.S. large-cap pharma and biotech stocks. Based on this metric, the stock appears highly undervalued compared to many names in its industry. Despite some analysts' bullishness, Sarepta also faces several risks. The most obvious is the potential that another patient dies from ELEVIDYS. Such an event would hit shares and could result in the FDA reinstating its order for Sarepta to stop selling the drug to certain patients. This would greatly damage the firm’s financial prospects. Illustrating these risks are the respective $13 and $15 price targets from Sanford C. Bernstein and Piper Sandler. These targets indicate significant downside potential in Sarepta stock from its Aug. 11 closing price of just under $18. In the long term, the firm also faces risks from competitors developing DMD therapies. That includes Solid Biosciences NASDAQ: SLDB. Their DMD treatment, known as SGT-003, has shown strong efficacy in early-stage trials. SGT-003’s delivery method is also designed to decrease liver targeting. This combination could boost the chance of the drug gaining FDA approval, as it works to mitigate one of ELEVIDYS’ key risks. SGT-003’s approval would likely significantly degrade Sarepta’s market share. Still, gaining FDA approval is notoriously difficult, and there is certainly no guarantee that SGT-003 will ever generate sales. Overall, Sarepta’s financials indicate the stock could have serious upside potential. However, investors should understand that this reality could change quickly if ELEVIDYS causes further deaths. This could result in the FDA requesting that the firm halt sales again, taking away one of its key revenue streams. Before you consider Sarepta Therapeutics, you'll want to hear this.","Since the reversal of the FDA’s request, Sarepta shares are up 50% as of the Aug. 11 close.",Such an event would hit shares and could result in the FDA reinstating its order for Sarepta to stop selling the drug to certain patients.,"However, multiple Wall Street analysts seem to believe a huge recovery could be in store for Sarepta.","Since the reversal of the FDA’s request, Sarepta shares are up 50% as of the Aug. 11 close."
US July budget deficit up 20% year-over-year despite record Trump tariff income,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/us-budget-deficit-up-20-year-over-year-despite-record-trump-tariff-income-2025-08-12/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. budget deficit in July climbed 20% this fiscal year compared to the last despite the U.S. taking in record income from President Donald Trump’s tariffs, according to Treasury Department data released Tuesday. The U.S. saw a 273% increase — or $21 billion — in customs revenue in July over the same period last year, the data showed. A Treasury official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview the data said overall increased spending is in part due to a mix of expenditures, including growing interest payments on the public debt and cost-of-living increases to Social Security payouts, among other costs. This comes as the federal government’s gross national debt creeps up to the $37 trillion mark. Even as Trump talks about America becoming rich because of his import tax hikes, federal spending keeps outpacing the revenues collected by the government. That financial picture might change as companies exhaust their pre-tariff inventories, forcing them to import more goods and generate even more in tax revenues that could whittle away at the deficit without meaningfully reducing it as promised. If tariffs fail to deliver on Trump's pledge to improve the government's balance sheet, the American public could be faced with fewer job options, more inflationary pressures and higher interest rates on mortgages, auto loans and credit cards. The budget deficit is the annual gap between what the U.S. government raises in taxes and what it spends, over time feeding into the overall national debt. While organizations like the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget say that tariff income can be a stream of meaningful revenue — estimated to generate about $1.3 trillion over the course of President Trump’s four-year term in office; some economists like Kent Smetters of the University of Pennsylvania’s Penn Wharton Budget Model say tariffs are likely to result “ in only modest reductions in federal debt.” In June, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff plan would cut deficits by $2.8 trillion over a 10-year period while shrinking the economy, raising the inflation rate and reducing the purchasing power of households overall. But revenue estimates are also difficult to predict as the president has changed his tariff rates repeatedly and the taxes declared as part of an economic emergency are currently under appeal in a U.S. court. A Treasury official did not respond to an Associated Press request for comment on when the U.S. could begin to see tariff revenue start to put a dent in the deficit. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last month on Fox Business Network's “Mornings with Maria” that the administration is “laser-focused on bringing this deficit down.” The Trump administration expects to make more trade deals with other nations, including China and other major economies. For instance, on Monday, Trump extended a trade truce with China for another 90 days, which preserves the 30% tariffs he had imposed as a condition for negotiations. The previous deadline was set to expire at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday. Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that he signed the executive order for the extension, and that “all other elements of the Agreement will remain the same.” Beijing, at the same time, also announced the extension of the tariff pause, according to the Ministry of Commerce. ___ Associated Press writer Josh Boak contributed to this report.","While organizations like the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget say that tariff income can be a stream of meaningful revenue — estimated to generate about $1.3 trillion over the course of President Trump’s four-year term in office; some economists like Kent Smetters of the University of Pennsylvania’s Penn Wharton Budget Model say tariffs are likely to result “ in only modest reductions in federal debt.” In June, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff plan would cut deficits by $2.8 trillion over a 10-year period while shrinking the economy, raising the inflation rate and reducing the purchasing power of households overall.","While organizations like the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget say that tariff income can be a stream of meaningful revenue — estimated to generate about $1.3 trillion over the course of President Trump’s four-year term in office; some economists like Kent Smetters of the University of Pennsylvania’s Penn Wharton Budget Model say tariffs are likely to result “ in only modest reductions in federal debt.” In June, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff plan would cut deficits by $2.8 trillion over a 10-year period while shrinking the economy, raising the inflation rate and reducing the purchasing power of households overall.","Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last month on Fox Business Network's “Mornings with Maria” that the administration is “laser-focused on bringing this deficit down.” The Trump administration expects to make more trade deals with other nations, including China and other major economies.","While organizations like the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget say that tariff income can be a stream of meaningful revenue — estimated to generate about $1.3 trillion over the course of President Trump’s four-year term in office; some economists like Kent Smetters of the University of Pennsylvania’s Penn Wharton Budget Model say tariffs are likely to result “ in only modest reductions in federal debt.” In June, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff plan would cut deficits by $2.8 trillion over a 10-year period while shrinking the economy, raising the inflation rate and reducing the purchasing power of households overall."

Mexican-American designer apologizes for Adidas sandal design accused of cultural appropriation,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/mexican-american-designer-apologizes-for-adidas-sandal-design-accused-of-cultural-appropriation-2025-08-12/,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexican-American clothing designer Willy Chavarria has apologized for an Adidas sandal he created after being accused by Mexican authorities of “cultural appropriation” for imitating an Indigenous shoe design. The design launched by Adidas, known as the Oaxaca Slip On, is a black sandal with braided leather straps attached to a chunky sports shoe sole. Mexican artisans and authorities say the intricate leather braids look strikingly similar to the traditional footwear known as huaraches made by the Zapotec Indigenous people in Oaxaca, produced mostly in the town of Villa Hidalgo Yalalag. They have accused the brand and Chavarria of “cultural appropriation” and of copying the design without the permission of the Indigenous community. Authorities were quick to note that cultural Mexican designs have long been copied by major brands before, and said they planned to tighten laws to protect Mexican designs. Chavarria responded to mounting criticisms in comments sent to The Associated Press on Tuesday. In a statement addressed to the “people of Oaxaca,” he said that the design was intended to “to honor the powerful cultural and artistic spirit of Oaxaca and its creative communities — a place whose beauty and resistance have inspired me.” “I am deeply sorry that the shoe was appropriated in this design and not developed in direct and meaningful partnership with the Oaxacan community,” Chavarria wrote. “This falls short of the respect and collaborative approach that Oaxaca, the Zapotec community of Villa Hidalgo Yalalag, and its people deserve.” Chavarria is a Mexican-American designer, who has risen to fame for his designs exploring Chicano, or Mexican-American, culture, often mixing Mexican themes with American products. His designs include sweaters reading “Chicano” in red, scripted font, and styles with the Mexican flag and cowboy hats reminiscent of northern Mexican culture. In recent months, Chavarria also was put in the spotlight for a show at Paris Fashion Week that was intended as criticism of the Trump administration's deportation policy. Chavarria's comments came days after Adidas made a public apology for the design, and in a statement said it was reaffirming “our commitment to collaborate with Yalalag in a respectful dialogue that honors their cultural legacy.” Last week, in a letter to Oaxacan state officials, the company requested to sit down with local officials and to discuss how it can “repair the damage” to Indigenous populations. “Adidas recognizes and values the cultural richness of Mexico’s Indigenous communities and the meaning of their artisanal heritage,” it wrote in a statement.","In a statement addressed to the “people of Oaxaca,” he said that the design was intended to “to honor the powerful cultural and artistic spirit of Oaxaca and its creative communities — a place whose beauty and resistance have inspired me.” “I am deeply sorry that the shoe was appropriated in this design and not developed in direct and meaningful partnership with the Oaxacan community,” Chavarria wrote.","Chavarria's comments came days after Adidas made a public apology for the design, and in a statement said it was reaffirming “our commitment to collaborate with Yalalag in a respectful dialogue that honors their cultural legacy.” Last week, in a letter to Oaxacan state officials, the company requested to sit down with local officials and to discuss how it can “repair the damage” to Indigenous populations.","“This falls short of the respect and collaborative approach that Oaxaca, the Zapotec community of Villa Hidalgo Yalalag, and its people deserve.” Chavarria is a Mexican-American designer, who has risen to fame for his designs exploring Chicano, or Mexican-American, culture, often mixing Mexican themes with American products.","In a statement addressed to the “people of Oaxaca,” he said that the design was intended to “to honor the powerful cultural and artistic spirit of Oaxaca and its creative communities — a place whose beauty and resistance have inspired me.” “I am deeply sorry that the shoe was appropriated in this design and not developed in direct and meaningful partnership with the Oaxacan community,” Chavarria wrote."
"Apple & Trump: $100B Investment, Tariffs News Push Shares Up 13%",https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/apple-and-trump-100b-investment-tariffs-news-lead-shares-higher/,"American technology stalwart Apple NASDAQ: AAPL just made headlines, with President Trump's influence and decision-making playing a key role in the stock's story. Below, we’ll detail two key pieces of news and explain why they are leading Apple shares higher. In February, Apple announced it would make a massive $500 billion investment in the United States over the next four years. On Aug. 6, the Magnificent Seven company upped the ante, committing an additional $100 billion investment to its home country. This move comes amid President Trump’s unwavering stance that he wants to see iPhones built in America. Trump reiterated this stance in a joint press conference with Apple CEO Tim Cook to announce the new investment. He called the investment “a significant step toward the ultimate goal of ensuring that iPhones sold in the United States of America also are made in America."" Cook did not parrot this notion. The economic advantage of producing iPhones overseas makes this unlikely. Analysts have estimated that producing an iPhone in the United States could bring its price to $3,500. That’s nearly triple the cost of the company’s most expensive iPhone 16 Pro Max model today, which retails for $1,199. This price increase would massively deteriorate Apple’s competitive positioning in the smartphone market. It is certainly not something investors should hope for. That’s part of the reason that markets are happy about the company’s latest U.S. investment. Trump has ramped up tariff pressure on Apple to get the firm to move iPhone manufacturing to the United States. With the latest investment, the company is garnering goodwill from the President, which can help it stay out of his tariff crosshairs. In the same press conference, Trump floated a 100% tariff on semiconductor imports. However, he said that companies that invest in America, like Apple, would be exempt from such regulations. Apple is playing ball with the President to protect its interests, and thus those of its shareholders. Additionally, on Aug. 6, Trump declared that he would raise India's tariff to 50%, starting 21 days after Aug. 7. This change is a response to India's continued oil imports from Russia. Initially, this appeared highly relevant to Apple. The company has moved much of its production for U.S.-sold iPhones to India, partly to avoid U.S. tariffs imposed on its traditional manufacturing hub, China. It reportedly hopes to move most of this production to India by the end of 2026. Higher tariffs on India would severely limit the company’s ambitions to avoid higher costs. However, further reports revealed that smartphones would be exempt from Indian tariffs. Apple won’t have to pay tariffs on Indian-made iPhones at all. It’s not unreasonable to think that the company’s $100 billion investment contributed to Trump’s exemption decision. Overall, Apple’s U.S. investments are helping it avoid tariffs in more ways than one: both on country and product-specific levies. Ultimately, these pieces of news led to Apple stock having one of its best weeks in quite a while. From Aug. 4 to Aug. 8, shares gained by more than 13%. Trump's tirade against the company has been one of the key factors weighing on Apple in 2025, with shares still down significantly on the year. Thus, it is only fitting that positive developments related to President Trump have resulted in positive price action. These news items are clearly good signs for Apple, indicating that the company could face less pressure from Trump going forward. Still, whether Apple can truly return to being a winner for stock market investors remains up in the air. The company has been extensively criticized for making underwhelming moves in artificial intelligence (AI). Markets want to see something change in the company's approach so that Apple can prove that it isn’t missing the boat on AI.

Oklo’s Stock Is Set up for a Correction—Buy It When It Bounces,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/oklos-stock-is-set-up-for-a-correctionbuy-it-when-it-bounces/,"Oklo’s NYSE: OKLO stock is poised for a correction in mid-Q3 because its explosive stock price increase attracted a fair number of short sellers, and the Q2 earnings release did not accelerate the timeline. The release was good, chock full of juicy news to keep investors interested, but no concrete changes or improvements to the revenue timeline. The takeaway is that this leading, advanced reactor company is well-positioned to deliver on its promise, with projects advancing, but no catalyst for higher share prices has emerged. In this scenario, the market could fall as much as 20% from the pre-release closing price before it begins to rebound, but when it does, it will be a screaming buy. Oklo is the leader in advanced, fast-reactor technology within the energy sector and is on track to commence operations within only a few years. Its vertically integrated model encompasses fuel, power, and adjacent isotope markets, offering a diversified income stream and cost efficiencies unmatched by any other advanced reactor company. Critical highlights from the quarter include the Trump administration's numerous executive orders, which clear red tape, streamline and accelerate approval processes, and provide tax credits and funding for start-up projects. Among the impacts of the orders is the potential for a technology-proving pilot project to come online as soon as July 2026, years ahead of the existing timeline. Other critical highlights include partnerships with Vertiv, Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power, and Centrus that expand and deepen the company’s industry appeal while prepping future revenue streams. The initial analysts’ response to Oklo’s news is crickets; MarketBeat tracked no notes or revisions within the first 18 hours of the release. This is good news because the trends leading into the release were bullish, providing support for this market. The trends include increased coverage with the number of analysts rising by more than 200% to 13 since the first of the year, the Moderate Buy sentiment firming with several Strong Buy ratings creeping into the mix, and the price target advancing. The consensus lags the market in mid-August but is up more than 400% in the preceding 12 months, with the high-end range aligning with recent price action. The takeaway is that the market for OKLO stock outpaced analysts' sentiment, and their targets align with a price pullback. However, the price targets should provide solid support near the $60 level if not higher, aligning with the technical support targets. The institutional group is likely to be buyers on an OKLO stock price pullback. The group owns 85% of the stock and has been buying robustly this year, netting $2 in shares for every $1 sold. The Q3 activity shows buying ramping to a multiquarter high in the first half of Q3, an indication of increased demand and market support. While the long-term outlook for OKLO stock is bullish, the high and rising short-interest suggests the top is in for Q3 and potentially the remainder of the year. The short interest has been growing over the past few months and is running near 15% as of late July, and will likely remain high if not increase as the quarter progresses. The catalyst to cover will be a concrete improvement in the timeline to revenue, which could come at any time but may not materialize for several quarters. The post-release price action was tepid; however, the market fell more than 1% suggesting it is ready to move lower. The critical near-term support is near the $69 level; a move below it will likely attract bearish activity and result in a more profound decline. Before you consider Oklo, you'll want to hear this.","The short interest has been growing over the past few months and is running near 15% as of late July, and will likely remain high if not increase as the quarter progresses.","The trends include increased coverage with the number of analysts rising by more than 200% to 13 since the first of the year, the Moderate Buy sentiment firming with several Strong Buy ratings creeping into the mix, and the price target advancing.",The institutional group is likely to be buyers on an OKLO stock price pullback.,"The trends include increased coverage with the number of analysts rising by more than 200% to 13 since the first of the year, the Moderate Buy sentiment firming with several Strong Buy ratings creeping into the mix, and the price target advancing."
Spirit Airlines sounds the alarm on its future ability to stay in business,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/spirit-airlines-sounds-the-alarm-on-its-future-ability-to-stay-in-business-2025-08-12/,"NEW YORK (AP) — Just five months after emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, Spirit Airlines is warning about its future ability to stay in business. Spirit Aviation Holdings, the budget carrier's parent company, says it has “substantial doubt” about its ability to continue as a going concern over the next year — which is accounting-speak for running out of money. In a quarterly report issued Monday, Spirit pointed to “adverse market conditions"" that it's continued to face after a recent restructuring and other efforts to revive its business. That includes weak demand for domestic leisure travel, which Spirit said persisted in the second quarter of its fiscal year — among other challenges and “uncertainties in its business operations” that the Florida company expects to continue “for at least the remainder of 2025.” Spirit’s shares tumbled more than 40% Tuesday, with the company’s stock closing at $2.10. Known for its no-frills, low-cost flights on a fleet of bright yellow planes, Spirit has struggled to recover and compete since the COVID-19 pandemic. Rising operation costs and mounting debt eventually led the company to seek bankruptcy protection in November. By the time of that Chapter 11 filing, the airline had lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020. When Spirit emerged from bankruptcy protection in March, the company successfully restructured some of its debt obligations and secured new financing for future operations. Spirit has continued to make other cost-cutting efforts since — including plans to furlough about 270 pilots and downgrade some 140 captains to first officers in the coming months. The furloughs and downgrades announced last month go into effect Oct. 1 and Nov. 1 to align with Spirit's “projected flight volume for 2026,” the company noted in its quarterly report. They also follow previous furloughs and job cuts before the company's bankruptcy filing last year. Despite these and other cost-cutting efforts, Spirit on Monday stressed that it needs more cash. As a result, the company said it may also sell certain aircraft and real estate. And as discount carriers struggle to compete with bigger airlines — many of which have snagged budget-conscious customers through their own tiered offerings — Spirit is attempting to tap into the growing market for more upscale travel. It is now offering flight options with tiered prices, the higher-priced tickets coming with more amenities. The company pointed to the new strategy again on Monday. Spirit’s aircraft fleet is relatively young, which has also made the airline an attractive takeover target. But such buyout attempts from budget rivals like JetBlue and Frontier were unsuccessful both before and during the bankruptcy process, and Spirit has not publicly indicated interest in such a transaction since.","In a quarterly report issued Monday, Spirit pointed to “adverse market conditions"" that it's continued to face after a recent restructuring and other efforts to revive its business.","That includes weak demand for domestic leisure travel, which Spirit said persisted in the second quarter of its fiscal year — among other challenges and “uncertainties in its business operations” that the Florida company expects to continue “for at least the remainder of 2025.” Spirit’s shares tumbled more than 40% Tuesday, with the company’s stock closing at $2.10.","When Spirit emerged from bankruptcy protection in March, the company successfully restructured some of its debt obligations and secured new financing for future operations.","That includes weak demand for domestic leisure travel, which Spirit said persisted in the second quarter of its fiscal year — among other challenges and “uncertainties in its business operations” that the Florida company expects to continue “for at least the remainder of 2025.” Spirit’s shares tumbled more than 40% Tuesday, with the company’s stock closing at $2.10."
Alphabet Reclaims $200 Threshold—Bull Run Reignited?,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/alphabet-reclaims-200-thresholdbull-run-reignited/,"Alphabet NASDAQ: GOOGL has quietly transformed what began as a shaky start to 2025 into a full-blown comeback. The stock lagged its Magnificent Seven peers early in the year, weighed down by regulatory fears and concerns that its dominance in search and advertising was wavering. Those worries are fading, and with them, the bears. As Alphabet leaned into its AI prowess, cloud strength, and ad resilience, its shares surged, and momentum is now firmly back. The stock is officially in the green year-to-date, up 6.18% as of Monday’s close, and has rocketed 32% in the past quarter alone, including an 11.5% jump this month alone. Most importantly, Alphabet has reclaimed the $200 level, a psychological and technical resistance point that had held it back for six months. Now sitting just under 3% from its 52-week high, Alphabet is setting itself up for a fresh breakout into uncharted territory. Technically, this is not an overbought sprint. Alphabet is still building its base, not blowing past resistance like many red-hot tech peers. The clean push through $200 after building weeks of momentum below it suggests more upside could be ahead, as long as the rally remains contained and measured. Alphabet’s compelling Q2 2025 earnings, released on July 23, are at the heart of the rebound. Total revenue of $96.43 billion beat expectations and reflected a substantial 14% year-over-year gain. Earnings per share came in at $2.31, well above consensus and up 22% YOY. Key growth came from advertising, cloud, and search. Google Cloud soared 32% to $13.62 billion, crossing the $50 billion annual run rate landmark. YouTube ad revenue climbed 13%, and, perhaps most importantly, Google Search & Other grew 11.7%, well above the 8% expected, helping to quiet concerns about AI disrupting Alphabet’s core business. These results weren’t ignored. Following the blowout quarter, a wave of analysts raised their price targets. Barclays lifted its target to $235 from $220, and JPMorgan increased it to $232 from $200. Multiple other firms followed suit. Institutional money also started flowing back in. Cathie Wood’s ARKW recently added $35 million in Alphabet shares. Zooming out, over the previous twelve months, institutions have been busy buying shares of the tech giant. In total, $96 billion worth of GOOGL has been purchased versus $52 billion in outflows over the previous year. Despite the surge in momentum, GOOGL still looks reasonably priced. Its current P/E is around 21.4, and its forward P/E of 18.9 remains well below its historical standards. So even after a 32% quarterly move, Alphabet isn’t trading at a tech bubble multiple, making the risk-reward picture more compelling for disciplined investors. For those anticipating more upside, a logical entry could be on a pullback toward key support zones near $190 or even $180, where resistance was overturned earlier in the year. If Alphabet can reclaim a clean stair-step pattern above $200, reinforced by analyst upgrades and institutional faith, it could quietly morph into one of this year’s strongest major-cap tech stories.
