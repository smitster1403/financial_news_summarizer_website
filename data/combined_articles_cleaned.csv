LTM TCV came in at $1.69bn (up 0.6% y/y) with a book-to-bill of 1.4x, while the LTM TCV stood at $6.5bn (up 12% y/y), driven by multi-year wins across managed services, modernisation, cyber, data, AI and AI-agent deployments, as the clients consolidate spend into fewer strategic partners and fund ‘run + modernize’ programs alongside targeted AI-led transformation. Whilst the growth was broadbased, it was skewed to Manufacturing & Resources (up 9.4% q/q) and Healthcare & Public Services (up 9.9%), with Europe (up 3.4%) and RoW (up 14.1%), driven by execution and wallet share gain in select pockets.

"LTIMindtree shares crash 6% after Q3 results; brokerages flag margin risks, near-term earnings concerns",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/ltimindtree-shares-crash-6-after-q3-results-brokerages-flag-margin-risks-near-term-earnings-visibility-13780450.html,"Shares of LTIMindtree Ltd fell sharply in early trade on Tuesday, slipping over 6 percent, as investors reacted to mostly cautious brokerage reviews following the company’s Q3 FY26 results. Analysts flagged concerns around margins and near-term earnings visibility despite largely in-line performance. The stock was trading at Rs 6,012.5 in morning deals, down 6.2 percent on the day. Over the past one year, LTIMindtree shares have gained just over 3 percent, significantly underperforming the benchmark Nifty 50, which is up about 9 percent over the same period. Brokerages said that LTIMindtree delivered an in-line quarter, but diverged on the outlook and valuation comfort. CLSA reiterated its ‘Outperform’ rating with a target price of Rs 7,067 per share, implying an upside of over 17 percent. The brokerage expressed confidence in the company’s guidance for a return to double-digit revenue growth by Q4 FY26. CLSA pointed out strong large deal wins across BFSI, public markets, and consumer and media segments, noting that deal ramp-ups should offset productivity gains from AI adoption. However, it flagged limited scope for near-term re-rating, arguing that future upside will be driven primarily by EPS growth rather than valuation expansion. Morgan Stanley maintained an ‘Equal-weight’ stance with a target price of Rs 6,300, citing positives such as growth in a top hi-tech client and signs of BFSI bottoming out. At the same time, it cautioned that near-term margin pressure remains a concern, resulting in a balanced risk-reward at current valuations. More cautious views came from Nomura and Citi. Nomura retained a ‘Neutral’ rating with a target price of Rs 5,900, pointing to a Q3 performance ranging from in-line to a modest miss, with EBIT margin at 16.1 percent coming in below estimates. It also flagged the one-time labour law provision of Rs 590 crore as a key drag. Citi, which has a ‘Sell’ call and a target price of Rs 5,415, said revenue was aided by seasonal pass-throughs and margins benefited from lower SG&A expenses, but warned that upcoming wage hikes could dent margins by around 100 basis points over Q4 and Q1. LTIMindtree on Monday reported a 12 percent year-on-year decline in net profit to Rs 960 crore for the December quarter, largely due to a one-time labour code-related charge of Rs 590.3 crore. Sequentially, profit fell over 30 percent. Revenue rose 11 percent year-on-year to Rs 10,781 crore, while operating margin improved 20 basis points sequentially to 16.1 percent. Excluding the labour code impact, net profit would have grown 29 percent year-on-year, the company said. Management commentary remained constructive, with CEO and MD Venu Lambu highlighting strong deal momentum, AI-led strategy execution, and a third consecutive quarter of over 2 percent sequential growth.

The shares of the company hit a new 52-week high of Rs 674.30 apiece in the morning trading hours of Tuesday. Hindustan Zinc Q3 results: Hindustan Zinc on January 19 reported a standalone net profit of Rs 3,879 crore for the October-December quarter of FY26. This marked a 46.5 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise from the Rs 2,647 crore net profit reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year. Revenue from operations meanwhile rose 27.5 percent YoY to Rs 10,922 crore during the quarter under review, as against a revenue of Rs 8,556 crore in the year-ago period. EBITDA increased 34.7 percent YoY to Rs 6,055 crore, while EBITDA margin expanded to 55 percent from 52 percent a year ago, supported by lower zinc cost of production and improved operating leverage. According to the company, Q3 marked its highest-ever quarterly revenue and profit, driven by higher metal production, stronger zinc and silver prices, and a sharp reduction in costs. Soaring silver prices: Silver prices hit fresh lifetime highs today, as tensions between US and EU simmered over President Donald Trump’s constant threats to annex Greenland. Silver futures with March expiry gained around 3 percent to hit a fresh all time high of Rs 3,18,729 per kilogram. The future contracts with May and July expiries meanwhile rose more than 3 percent to hit fresh lifetime highs of Rs 3,28,854 per kilogram and Rs 3,35,885 per kilogram, respectively. Hindustan Zinc is the largest producer of silver in India, and produces refined silver with a minimum 99.9 percent purity. HSBC on Hindustan Zinc: HSBC kept a ‘Buy’ call on the shares of Hindustan Zinc, with a target price of Rs 750 per share. This implies an upside potential of nearly 14 percent from the stock’s previous closing price of Rs 660.4 apiece. The company’s Q3 earnings beat estimates due to higher volumes and lower costs, HSBC said. It added that strong silver prices should further lift earnings. The firm expects Q4 results to be even stronger due to higher volumes and sharply higher silver prices. Jefferies on Hindustan Zinc: Jefferies raised its target price for the stock to Rs 750 per share, while maintaining its ‘Buy’ rating. The latest target price implies an upside potential of nearly 14 percent from the previous closing price. The international brokerage said that the firm benefitted from rising silver and zinc prices. It raised FY26-28 EPS estimates by 3–10 percent, as costs remain under control. It expects the company to post 47 percent YoY EPS Growth in FY27, followed by 6 percent In FY28. Jefferies further said that Hindustan Zinc’s valuation at 9.4x FY27 EV/EBITDA as against a long-term average of 7.3x is justified by rising silver share in EBIT. Citi on Hindustan Zinc: Citi however kept its ‘Sell’ call on the stock with a target price of Rs 585 per share, which implies a downside potential of more than 11 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. The firm said that Hindustan Zinc’s Q3 EBITDA rose 35 percent YoY driven by better silver prices, lower costs & higher volumes. The company is targeting 2 percent refined volume growth in FY26 & CoP of $1,000. Nuvama on Hindustan Zinc: Nuvama kept a ‘Reduce’ call on Hindustan Zinc shares, with a target price of Rs 591 apiece. This implies a downside potential of more than 10.5 percent over the stock’s previous closing price. The international brokerage said that the firm’s Q3 EBITDA was in-line with its estimates. Silver EBIT surged 56 percent QoQ, and accounted for 44 percent of EBIT. Nuvama lifted its EBITDA estimates by 28 percent for FY27 and 21 percent for FY28, assuming that the average zinc and silver prices of $3,000 and $60 for FY27, and $2,900 and $55 for FY28, respectively.

LTIMindtree Q3 FY26 – Is the price already discounting the strong quarter?,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/moneycontrol-research/ltimindtree-q3-fy26-is-the-price-already-discounting-the-strong-quarter-13780264.html,"Highlights LTIMindtree (LTIM, CMP: Rs 6407, Market Cap: Rs 189,960 crore, Rating: Overweight) reported a good Q3 FY26 with a strong sequential surge in revenue despite the seasonality, uptick in margin, and steady deal flow. The management remains optimistic about clocking close to double-digit YoY growth in revenue in Q4 and maintaining the momentum in FY27. The stock has been an out-performer in the IT pack and has performed in line with the Nifty in the past year. While the headline valuation isn’t cheap, the growth journey makes us constructive. Strong surge in revenue Revenue for the last reported quarter Q3 FY26 at $1208 million represented a sequential growth of 2.4 percent in reported currency and in Constant Currency (CC). The reporting quarter (Q3FY26) saw strong performance from Healthcare, Life Sciences & Public Services, followed by Manufacturing & Resources. The Consumer business had a positive sequential growth. Weakness was seen in BFSI (banking financial service and insurance) and Technology, Media & Communication because of a combination of furloughs and productivity passthrough in some top accounts. All the three key markets of North America, Europe, and the Rest of the World (RoW) had a positive sequential growth. The PAN deal from India had a positive rub-off on RoW. Weakness in top accounts transitory Unlike the strength in the overall business, the top 5 accounts (which include the top hitech and BFSI account) de-grew YoY 8.7 percent and a sequential 2.9 percent in Q3 FY26. The temporary impact has been on account of recalibration as LTIM has passed on AI-driven productivity gains to customers. The top hi-tech account has started growing sequentially and the BFSI segment and the top account is likely to bottom out in Q4. The impact of the AI-led productivity gains is more meaningful in large engagements and the management expects growth momentum from these large accounts to resume from FY27. Guiding to margin stability LTIM’s EBIT margin expanded 20 basis points QoQ in Q3 FY26 to 16.1 percent. Tailwinds from the Fit-for-Future efficiency gains programme and forex were partially offset by furloughs and lower working days. The management remains confident of sustaining margin improvement supported by levers, including AI-driven productivity gains, pyramid optimisation through fresher hiring, and continued cost discipline. It has started a new programme called New Horizon for steady focus on cost and margin. The likely wage hike in Q4 to be spread over two quarters is likely to cause 1 percent margin headwind each quarter. LTIM reported a net headcount addition of 1,511 employees in Q3FY26, including 1736 freshers, taking the total workforce to 87,958. This further bolsters confidence on future execution. Gaining the AI edge The key initiatives from LTIM are launching ""Blueverse Studios"" in Mumbai and London as AI collaboration hubs for clients. The company has completed the GenAI Foundation training programme for 80,000 employees and has won multiple AI-specific deals, including developing agentic solutions and GenAI-based platforms for global clients. Bookings steady The Q3FY26 order book TCV (total contract value) stood at $1.69 billion, flat YoY but up by over 6 percent sequentially. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter with TCV above $ 1.5 billion. The management remains optimistic about achieving close to double-digit USD revenue growth in Q4 and maintaining the momentum, supported by robust deal wins, strong execution, continued operational efficiencies and opportunities arising from AI. Thanks to the outperformance, the stock isn’t cheap, but the growth trajectory warrants attention of long-term investors.

Dollar Index (Slips) The dollar retreated to its lowest level in a week in early trading on Monday after threats from the White House towards the European Union over the future of Greenland triggered a broad selloff across U.S. stocks and government bonds.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Tata Elxsi, Colgate Palmolive, Shriram Finance, Canara Bank, CCL Products, and others on January 20?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-tata-elxsi-colgate-palmolive-shriram-finance-canara-bank-ccl-products-and-others-on-january-20-13779904.html,"Equity benchmarks declined four-tenths of a percent on January 19, with market breadth consistently favouring bears. About 2,190 shares were under pressure against 728 shares that advanced on the NSE. The market is expected to consolidate and trade within the previous week’s range. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi Bajaj Auto | CMP: Rs 9,429.5 Bajaj Auto has entered a healthy pullback phase after breaking out above its long-term falling trendline, as visible on the chart. Such pullbacks are often considered constructive, as they allow prices to consolidate and attract fresh buying interest without damaging the overall trend structure. From an indicator perspective, the Directional Movement Index (DMI) shows the positive line clearly in control, suggesting that buying strength remains dominant. The Average Directional Index (ADX) is holding above the 20 level, indicating that the trend is gaining stability and strength rather than weakening. Meanwhile, the MACD remains above the zero line, reflecting positive momentum and supporting the continuation of the bullish trend. Based on this technical combination, the pullback is viewed as an opportunity rather than a sign of weakness. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 9,450–9,400 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 10,200 Stop-Loss: Rs 9,000 Balkrishna Industries | CMP: Rs 2,431.6 Balkrishna Industries has shown a strong improvement in its technical structure, supported by multiple bullish signals. The 9- and 26-DEMA have delivered a bullish crossover, indicating a shift in short-term momentum in favour of the bulls. In addition, the stock has confirmed a breakout above its falling trendline, suggesting a change in the medium-term trend. Momentum indicators further strengthen the positive outlook. The DMI has recorded a bullish crossover, reflecting increasing buying pressure, while the MACD has moved above the zero line, highlighting a transition into positive momentum territory. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 2,410–2,400 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,600 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,300 Tata Elxsi | CMP: Rs 5,563 Tata Elxsi has successfully retested its breakout zone, as highlighted on the chart, confirming the strength and sustainability of the recent breakout. Notably, volumes are picking up near lower levels, indicating strong accumulation interest and reinforcing the positive price structure. The breakout above the falling trendline further supports a shift in the medium-term trend from bearish to bullish. On the momentum front, the MACD is positioned above the zero line, signalling positive momentum, while the DMI continues to reflect bullish dominance. Additionally, the ADX is holding above the 25 level, suggesting that the emerging trend is gaining strength and reliability. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 5,600–5,500 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 6,250 Stop-Loss: Rs 5,200 Jay Thakkar, Vice President & Head of Derivatives and Quant Research at ICICI Securities Colgate Palmolive India | CMP: Rs 2,178 Colgate Palmolive has provided a breakout from the falling trendline, accompanied by a decrease in open interest, indicating short covering. There had been heavy short positions in the stock, and it had declined nearly 50 percent from its all-time high. Significant positive divergence is visible on both daily and weekly charts, indicating a higher probability of continued short covering. The risk-to-reward ratio is clearly in favour of the bulls; hence, one may initiate long positions in this series. Options data indicates that the Rs 2,200 strike has the highest Call base, and a close above this level could lead to further upward momentum. Buy Colgate Palmolive futures in the range of Rs 2,170–2,190. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,250, Rs 2,300 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,120 Mankind Pharma | CMP: Rs 2,117.2 Mankind Pharma has been forming lower tops and lower bottoms, with an increase in open interest clearly indicating short build-up in the near term. Hence, the short-term trend remains negative. A bounce witnessed a few weeks ago was largely due to short covering, and once that move ended, the stock resumed its primary downtrend, with fresh additions on the short side. There is a huge Call base at the Rs 2,200 strike, and the stock has closed significantly below this level. The maximum pain is also at the Rs 2,200 level. Until this level is decisively crossed, the short-term trend is likely to remain weak. Any bounce should be utilised as a selling opportunity. Sell Mankind Pharma futures in the range of Rs 2,120–2,140. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 2,060, Rs 2,020 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,180 HCL Technologies | CMP: Rs 1,716.8 HCL Tech has been moving higher following its Q3 results, indicating a bullish short-term trend. There has been a decrease in open interest along with a rise in price, suggesting short covering. Large-cap IT stocks have largely witnessed short build-up, with heavyweights such as Wipro, TCS, and Infosys still carrying substantial short positions. Meanwhile, midcap IT stocks have been outperforming large caps. Despite this, HCL Tech has emerged as an outperformer within the large-cap IT space and has been gradually forming higher tops and higher bottoms. As per options data, once the stock closes above the Rs 1,720 level, which has the highest Call base, it is likely to move towards the Rs 1,800 level. Buy HCL Tech futures in the range of Rs 1,700–1,720. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,760, Rs 1,800 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,645 Vidnyan S Sawant, Head of Research at GEPL Capital Shriram Finance | CMP: Rs 1,010.35 Shriram Finance continues to exhibit a robust structural uptrend across timeframes, characterised by a classical higher-top and higher-bottom price formation. On the weekly timeframe, the stock is firmly placed above its key 12- and 26-week EMAs, underscoring strong trend strength. The MACD momentum indicator is trending higher, reflecting acceleration in upside momentum and reinforcing the bullish bias. On the daily chart, the stock has displayed a bullish mean reversion from the 12-day DEMA, further validating the positive outlook and suggesting continuation of the prevailing uptrend. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,081 Stop-Loss: Rs 970 Canara Bank | CMP: Rs 156.86 Canara Bank has recently displayed strong positive structural developments on the higher timeframe. During the October series, the stock witnessed a decisive breakout above its multi-year swing highs of 2010 and 2024, marking a transition into uncharted territory. The stock is firmly sustaining above its 12-, 26-, and 50-period DEMA, while continuing to form higher tops and higher bottoms, highlighting strong relative strength amid prevailing market volatility. Momentum indicators further validate this strength, with the MACD remaining in buy mode, reinforcing that the ongoing uptrend is well supported by positive momentum. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 172 Stop-Loss: Rs 150 Bharat Electronics | CMP: Rs 412.8 BEL has been in a robust long-term uptrend since 2020, consistently demonstrating resilience on the monthly timeframe. On the weekly chart, the stock continues to form higher bottoms and is currently consolidating around its 26-week EMA, indicating healthy price digestion within an ongoing uptrend. On the daily timeframe, BEL maintains a higher-top and higher-bottom structure. Notably, during recent pullbacks, the stock has displayed a repetitive price behaviour wherein corrections tend to remain contained at around 4 percent, after which the stock resumes its upward trajectory. This recurring pattern reinforces the strength of the prevailing trend. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 447 Stop-Loss: Rs 400 CCL Products India | CMP: Rs 983.75 CCL Products has been on a sustained upward trajectory since 2020, forming a sequence of higher tops and higher bottoms on the monthly timeframe, a classic indication of a long-term bullish trend. On the weekly chart, the stock has exhibited a bullish mean reversion from the 26-week EMA, while the Stochastic oscillator remains in buy mode, reinforcing the positive outlook. On the daily timeframe, the stock has witnessed a reversal from the 2025 gap support, further validating the underlying strength and confirming a constructive near-term sentiment. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,101 Stop-Loss: Rs 944","On the daily chart, the stock has displayed a bullish mean reversion from the 12-day DEMA, further validating the positive outlook and suggesting continuation of the prevailing uptrend.","Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 447 Stop-Loss: Rs 400 CCL Products India | CMP: Rs 983.75 CCL Products has been on a sustained upward trajectory since 2020, forming a sequence of higher tops and higher bottoms on the monthly timeframe, a classic indication of a long-term bullish trend.","Such pullbacks are often considered constructive, as they allow prices to consolidate and attract fresh buying interest without damaging the overall trend structure.","On the daily chart, the stock has displayed a bullish mean reversion from the 12-day DEMA, further validating the positive outlook and suggesting continuation of the prevailing uptrend."

"India’s healthcare deals top Rs 10,000 crore in Q2FY26 as hospitals, diagnostics lead expansion: EY",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/india-s-healthcare-deals-top-rs-10-000-crore-in-q2fy26-as-hospitals-diagnostics-lead-expansion-ey-13779668.html,"Indian healthcare sector delivered one of its strongest quarters in recent years, clocking over Rs 10,000 crore in M&A transactions in Q2 FY26, underpinned by rising demand for high‑acuity care, rapid diagnostics expansion and aggressive capacity additions by leading hospital chains, EY‑Parthenon said in its quarterly sector update. Deal activity remained broad‑based across hospitals, diagnostics and specialty care, comprising buyouts, minority investments and cross‑border acquisitions. Private equity and strategic investors continued to chase scalable regional platforms with strong clinical depth and technology‑enabled models, EY said. Hospitals to add 18,000 Beds High‑end clinical specialties—oncology, cardiology, neurology and gastroenterology—drove a sharp pickup in patient volumes and pricing power across the sector. Average revenue per occupied bed rose 10–16% year‑on‑year among large chains, aided by higher case complexity and tighter pricing discipline. India’s biggest networks are in the middle of their most ambitious expansion cycle yet, with plans to add over 18,000 beds in the next three to five years. Apollo Hospitals, Max, Aster, NH, KIMS and several mid‑market chains reported double‑digit revenue growth, stable to rising occupancy and stronger international patient flows. Digital and home‑care‑led revenues contributed as much as 25–30 percent for some operators. Diagnostics leads growth Diagnostics chains again outperformed, recording 10–22 percent revenue growth. Several players posted EBITDA margins in the 25–35 percent range, benefiting from scale efficiencies and an accelerated shift toward genomics, molecular testing and oncology diagnostics. Preventive and wellness packages contributed up to 26% of quarterly revenue for select chains, reflecting rising out‑of‑pocket spending and deeper penetration into Tier‑3 and Tier‑4 cities. Industry consolidation continued, with integration of recent acquisitions—Core Diagnostics, DAPIC, Scientific Pathology—progressing across networks. Franchise‑led expansion in smaller towns remained a significant growth lever. Specialty hospitals, med‑tech see sustained momentum Single‑specialty chains, including oncology and mother‑and‑child operators, reported steady improvement in occupancy, driven by clinician additions and capacity expansion in fast‑growing clusters. Medical device companies delivered healthy revenue growth backed by capacity commissioning and global acquisitions in cardiology and orthopedics. Investor appetite strong despite valuation premiums Healthcare assets continued to command premium valuations, with listed-company EV/EBITDA multiples ranging from the mid‑teens to above 30x, EY said. Investors increasingly favored integrated platforms and tech‑enabled offerings, while also pushing portfolio companies to expand into Tier‑2 and Tier‑3 markets. “Q2 FY26 reinforces the structural strength of India’s healthcare sector,” said Kaivaan Movdawalla, National Healthcare Leader at EY‑Parthenon. “The clear shift toward high‑acuity care and the rapid rise of advanced diagnostics reflect a sector poised for long‑term, durable growth.” Outlook EY expects momentum to remain firm through FY26, supported by rising consumption, expanding insurance penetration and newly commissioned hospital capacity coming on stream. While margin pressure may persist for new assets, medium‑term fundamentals remain robust, the firm said. “Investor interest is set to remain strong as strategic and financial buyers build long‑term exposure to the sector,” said Amit Gupta, Partner – Healthcare & Life Sciences Investment Banking at EY. “Scalable platforms with strong unit economics and clear expansion pathways will command sustained premiums.” Some important deals in recent times Manipal Hospitals completed a full buyout of Sahyadri Hospitals from OTPP for Rs 5300 crore as part of its ongoing multi‑specialty expansion strategy, while Baby Memorial Hospital acquired a majority stake in Meitra Hospital for Rs 1000-Rs 1200 crore, adding a premium tertiary‑care platform to its portfolio. Fortis Healthcare strengthened its North India cluster with the Rs 470‑crore acquisition of Shrimann Hospitals in Punjab, even as Narayana Hrudayalaya made its first major overseas move with a £183‑million acquisition of Practice Plus Group Hospitals in the UK, marking its entry into that market. Yatharth Hospital also expanded its regional presence through a Rs 260‑crore purchase of a 150‑bed hospital in Agra from the local promoter group, further consolidating its footprint in North India.","Indian healthcare sector delivered one of its strongest quarters in recent years, clocking over Rs 10,000 crore in M&A transactions in Q2 FY26, underpinned by rising demand for high‑acuity care, rapid diagnostics expansion and aggressive capacity additions by leading hospital chains, EY‑Parthenon said in its quarterly sector update.","Indian healthcare sector delivered one of its strongest quarters in recent years, clocking over Rs 10,000 crore in M&A transactions in Q2 FY26, underpinned by rising demand for high‑acuity care, rapid diagnostics expansion and aggressive capacity additions by leading hospital chains, EY‑Parthenon said in its quarterly sector update.","Average revenue per occupied bed rose 10–16% year‑on‑year among large chains, aided by higher case complexity and tighter pricing discipline.","“Scalable platforms with strong unit economics and clear expansion pathways will command sustained premiums.” Some important deals in recent times Manipal Hospitals completed a full buyout of Sahyadri Hospitals from OTPP for Rs 5300 crore as part of its ongoing multi‑specialty expansion strategy, while Baby Memorial Hospital acquired a majority stake in Meitra Hospital for Rs 1000-Rs 1200 crore, adding a premium tertiary‑care platform to its portfolio."

Sun Pharma terms $10-billion Organon buy report as 'speculative',https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/sun-pharma-terms-10-billion-organon-buy-report-as-speculative-13779506.html,"Sun Pharma on Monday called the news report about the company evaluating $10-billion acquisition of US drugmaker Organon as ""speculative"". ""The information set out in the article is speculative in nature and there is no material event or information that requires disclosure,"" Sun Pharma said in a statement to stock exchanges. The Economic Times on Monday reported citing people familiar with the matter that Sun Pharma is evaluating a takeover of Organon & Co. in a transaction that could be valued at about $10 billion including debt, a move that would mark the biggest overseas acquisition ever by an Indian drugmaker. The report said the deal would give India’s largest pharmaceutical company by market value a stronger commercial base in the US—its largest market—and expand its presence in women’s health and the fast‑growing biosimilars segment. Organon, spun off from Merck in 2021 with a sizeable debt load, has been divesting assets to streamline its balance sheet and refocus on core biopharma operations. Its market value has more than halved over the past year, prompting renewed buyer interest, the newspaper reported. Sun Pharma has hired a European bank to help structure financing for the potential acquisition, ET said. While discussions have picked up as Organon’s share price weakened, there is no certainty the talks will result in a transaction. The buyer may consider an all‑cash bid or a combination of stock and cash, ET reported, adding that rival interest could still emerge. For Sun, the deal would represent its boldest global move since its purchase of Ranbaxy Laboratories in 2014. The potential acquisition of Organon would allow the drugmaker to significantly expand its US scale in specialty and branded medicines, while also broadening its women’s health footprint—a category where Organon has long‑established leadership. The deal would further strengthen Sun’s position in the consolidated global biosimilars market, giving it access to Organon’s portfolio developed with Samsung Bioepis, and diversify its US operations beyond dermatology and ophthalmology into higher‑margin therapeutic areas. Absorbing Organon could also help Sun accelerate its shift toward higher‑margin branded and specialty products in the US market, where it has launched several innovative therapies over the past few years. Investor anticipation around a potential sale has already driven Organon’s shares up 28% over the past month, reversing part of the steep losses the stock suffered earlier. Organon generated $6.4 billion in revenue in FY24, while its biosimilar portfolio, developed with Samsung Bioepis, contributed around $660 million last year. The US drugmaker inherited $9.5 billion in debt at its 2021 spin‑off and still carried $8.9 billion in borrowings by Q2 2025. It has been actively selling assets to cut leverage. It recently sold its postpartum hemorrhage device to Laborie Medical—to pivot more aggressively toward women’s health biopharma and biosimilars.","The potential acquisition of Organon would allow the drugmaker to significantly expand its US scale in specialty and branded medicines, while also broadening its women’s health footprint—a category where Organon has long‑established leadership.","The Economic Times on Monday reported citing people familiar with the matter that Sun Pharma is evaluating a takeover of Organon & Co. in a transaction that could be valued at about $10 billion including debt, a move that would mark the biggest overseas acquisition ever by an Indian drugmaker.","Organon, spun off from Merck in 2021 with a sizeable debt load, has been divesting assets to streamline its balance sheet and refocus on core biopharma operations.",The report said the deal would give India’s largest pharmaceutical company by market value a stronger commercial base in the US—its largest market—and expand its presence in women’s health and the fast‑growing biosimilars segment.

Outlook for January 20 Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities Today, the benchmark indices corrected sharply. The Nifty ends 109 points lower, while the Sensex was down by 324 points. Among sectors, the Reality Index lost the most, shed over 2 percent, whereas despite weak market sentiment, some buying interest was seen in selective FMCG stocks. Technically, after an early morning intraday selloff, the market took support near 25,500/82900 and trimmed some losses. However, the short-term market texture remains weak. On daily charts, it has formed a bearish candle, and on intraday charts, it is holding a weak formation, which is largely negative. We are of the view that the current market texture is weak, but a fresh selloff is possible only if 25,500/82900 is dismissed. Below this level, the market could slip to 25,400-25,350/82600-82500. On the flip side, above 25,650/83500, a pullback move could extend till 25,750-25,800/83800-84000. The intraday market texture is volatile and non-directional; hence, level-based trading would be the ideal strategy for day traders. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The Nifty remained under bearish control, with the index sustaining below the 20 EMA throughout the session. Intraday volatility persisted, and every rise was sold into. The RSI continued in a bearish crossover and trended lower as the index closed at a multi-day low. Market fear remained elevated, as reflected by a spike in India VIX.

The brokerage, however, noted that margins were impacted during the quarter as the company did not fully pass on the rise in commodity prices in order to protect demand.

"Yes Bank shares fall 3% today after Q3 results; brokerages bearish on growth, returns",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/yes-bank-ltd-shares-fall-3-today-after-q3-results-brokerages-bearish-on-growth-returns-13778914.html,"Shares of Yes Bank fell nearly 3 percent in early trade on Monday despite the lender reporting a sharp jump in fiscal third quarter net profit, as brokerages flagged concerns over weak credit growth, sub-par returns and valuation comfort, and largely maintained their bearish stance on the stock. Yes Bank stock was trading at Rs 22.78 in the afternoon session, down 2.9 percent, even as the private sector lender posted a 55 percent year-on-year rise in standalone net profit for Q3 FY26, aided by a sharp reduction in provisions. Over the past one year, Yes Bank shares are still up over 20 percent, outperforming the benchmark Nifty 50’s roughly 10 percent gain. Profit jump fails to reassure Street Yes Bank’s Q3 profit growth was driven largely by a steep 91 percent year-on-year fall in provisions, helping lift return on assets to around 0.9 percent. However, several brokerages said that the improvement was not backed by a meaningful acceleration in core growth or sustainable returns. Anand Rathi said retail stress remains visible and return on equity continues to be sub-par, adding that the profit uptick was largely a function of lower provisioning rather than a structural improvement in earnings quality. Emkay Global maintained its ‘Sell’ rating with a target price of Rs 20, citing anemic credit growth of around 5 percent year-on-year, dragged by the retail segment. The brokerage said the bank remains dependent on recoveries from non-performing assets to drive profitability, while growth and return metrics continue to lag peers. Emkay also flagged elevated valuations, noting that the stock trades at about 1.4 times FY27 estimated adjusted book value, which it considers demanding given the weak growth profile and modest return outlook. While management commentary suggests that corporate portfolio consolidation may be largely behind and growth could improve, Emkay said it remains cautious, pointing to the possibility of another round of portfolio clean-up following potential top management changes. Citi adds to caution; analyst ratings show bearishness Citi, which also has a ‘Sell’ stance on the stock, acknowledged the bank’s efforts to reconstruct stressed assets and improve net interest margins. However, the brokerage said it is closely monitoring the Supreme Court hearing related to the AT-1 bonds case, which remains an overhang. According to LSEG data cited by Reuters, the stock is currently rated ‘Sell’ on average by 11 analysts, with a median target price of Rs 18, implying downside from current levels. While brokerages broadly agree that Yes Bank has made progress on asset quality and balance-sheet clean-up since its reconstruction, they remain unconvinced about the sustainability of earnings improvement without a sharper pickup in loan growth and a clearer path to higher returns.

"We can launch a new drug every 2 or 3 years, Wockhardt chairman Khorakiwala",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/we-can-launch-a-new-drug-every-2-or-3-years-wockhardt-chairman-khorakiwala-13778531.html,"Drugmaker Wockhardt expects the next decade to be a defining phase for its innovation strategy, with the company preparing to roll out a steady stream of novel antibiotics to tackle drug resistance, a growing are of concern among doctors and patients alike. Chairman Dr Habil Khorakiwala has told Moneycontrol that Wockhardt has five to six new drugs slated for launch over the next four to five years and has more in early stages of development. ""So, we will have every two years, three years, a new drug coming out for the next 10 to 15 years. I have another two or three drugs which we have not even announced, which are in early stages,"" he said on the sidelines of an industry event in Mumbai recently. The portfolio, internally referred to as the “next wave of pipeline assets”, stays firmly anchored in antibiotics, an area big pharma has abandoned due to low commercial returns. Wockhardt chose a “white‑space strategy” in anti‑infectives, where global players have pulled back and resistance levels are rising sharply, creating both medical need and market opportunity, Khorakiwala said. “Why would we give up a lead we already have?” he said, adding Wockhardt plans to remain exclusively focused on antibiotics for the next 10–20 years. Wockhardt's antibiotic pipeline is focused heavily on multi-drug resistant (MDR) infections, with novel agents such as Zaynich (Zidebactam/Cefepime) currently seeking USFDA approval. WCK 6777 (Odrate), a once-daily outpatient treatment for complex infections such as those of the urinary tract and intra-abdominal, has received USFDA Fast Track designation. The company also has early-stage candidates such as WCK 771 and WCK 2349, and the recently launched Indian respiratory antibiotic Miqnaf (Nafithromycin), all targeting critical unmet needs for severe bacterial infections. The company also has WCK 4282, branded as Foviscu, undergoing clinical trials. Zaynich’s review status Khorakiwala said Zaynich’s new drug application (NDA) is under a six–to eight–month Fast Track USFDA review, with expected approval by mid‑2026, and he is “very confident of a positive outcome” for the drug aimed at life-threatening multi-drug resistant “superbugs”. Khorakiwala said the company is evaluating various strategies to take its pipeline global: building its own commercial footprint in markets such as the US for injectable hospital antibiotics, and selectively pursuing partnerships or licensing deals if the economics justify it. Wockhardt has appointed a merchant banker and is holding discussions with potential partners, though Khorakiwala insists the company will commercialise products independently if valuations do not reflect the scientific value created. Developing a commercial organisation is “far easier” than building a research engine, particularly since the company’s new drugs are aimed at tertiary-care, high-end hospitals that require focused sales teams of “50–100 people” in the US market, Khorakiwala said. He also positioned Wockhardt’s antibiotic research as a strategic national asset, saying India could become a global leader if the government directs funding and regulatory reforms toward organisations with demonstrated innovation capability. The company has called for streamlining Phase 3 approvals, which take nearly two years in India compared to five to six months in the US and Europe.","""So, we will have every two years, three years, a new drug coming out for the next 10 to 15 years.","Zaynich’s review status Khorakiwala said Zaynich’s new drug application (NDA) is under a six–to eight–month Fast Track USFDA review, with expected approval by mid‑2026, and he is “very confident of a positive outcome” for the drug aimed at life-threatening multi-drug resistant “superbugs”.","WCK 6777 (Odrate), a once-daily outpatient treatment for complex infections such as those of the urinary tract and intra-abdominal, has received USFDA Fast Track designation.","Drugmaker Wockhardt expects the next decade to be a defining phase for its innovation strategy, with the company preparing to roll out a steady stream of novel antibiotics to tackle drug resistance, a growing are of concern among doctors and patients alike."

Wipro shares crash 7% as weak Q3 guidance outweighs steady operations; brokerages split on stock outlook,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/wipro-shares-crash-7-as-weak-q3-guidance-outweighs-steady-operations-brokerages-split-on-stock-outlook-13778256.html,"Wipro Ltd shares tumbled nearly 7 percent in Monday’s morning trade to around Rs 249, extending their recent underperformance, as investors reacted to weaker-than-expected near-term guidance issued alongside the company’s Q3 results late Friday. The selloff reflects investor concerns despite relatively steady operational performance in the fiscal third quarter. Today's fall adds to Wipro’s weak longer-term showing. The stock is down about 17.3 percent over the past year, sharply lagging the Nifty 50’s roughly 10 percent gain over the same period. For the quarter ended December 31, 2025, Wipro reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 3,119 crore, down 4 percent quarter-on-quarter and 7 percent year-on-year. IT services revenue stood at Rs 23,378 crore, missing Street estimates but rising 3.3 percent sequentially. Operating performance was mixed, with the company highlighting margin discipline and strong cash generation. However, at the heart of investor concern seems to be Wipro’s guidance for the March quarter, which came in below Street expectations, even as the company reported sequential revenue growth and maintained margins. Wipro guided for IT services revenue of $2.635 billion to $2.688 billion for the March quarter. This implies sequential growth of 0 percent to 2 percent in constant currency terms. Post-results brokerage commentary points to a clear divide. While some analysts see value support and operational discipline, others argue that weak deal momentum and execution risks justify caution -- views that appear to be driving Monday’s sell-off. Nomura: Buy, but flags guidance disappointment Nomura reiterated a Buy rating on Wipro with a target price of Rs 290 per share, arguing that Q3 operational performance was ahead of expectations. The brokerage acknowledged that Q4 guidance was weaker than anticipated, but noted that deal wins remained steady and margin discipline was intact. While Nomura cut its EPS estimates for FY27–FY28, it believes valuation comfort and dividend yield provide downside support to the stock. Jefferies: Underperform on growth and margin risks Jefferies struck a more cautious tone, maintaining an Underperform rating with a target price of Rs 220 per share. The brokerage said Q3 adjusted results were largely in line with expectations, but flagged weak deal bookings and delays in ramping new contracts as key risks to growth guidance. Jefferies also warned that margins could come under pressure from deal ramp-ups and acquisitions, and said low EPS CAGR and limited dividend appeal make the stock’s risk-reward unattractive.

The stock was trading at Rs 926.65 in the opening minutes, down 0.48 percent. Ahead of the quarterly results, HDFC Bank shares had risen 0.55 percent on Friday to close at Rs 930.55 on the NSE. The stock has gained 13.7 percent over the past one year, outperforming the benchmark Nifty 50, which has returned less than 11 percent over the same period.

Net interest income grew 6.4 percent, while asset quality remained stable, with gross NPAs unchanged sequentially at 1.24 percent. Brokerage reactions to the results were largely constructive. CLSA and Bernstein reiterated Outperform ratings with target prices of Rs 1,200 per share, citing a modest earnings beat, improving margins and disciplined cost control.

"ICICI Bank shares crash 3% today even as brokerages bullish on Q3 results, view CEO extension a key relief",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/icici-bank-stock-outlook-brokerages-largely-positive-even-after-q3-profit-miss-ceo-extension-a-key-relief-13778084.html,"ICICI Bank share price fell as much as 3 percent in the opening trade on Monday after its Q3 FY26 results, even as the brokerages gave bullish calls on the stock. The stock fell to Rs 1,367 on NSE, down 3.1 percent from the previous close. Brokerages largely retained their positive stance on ICICI Bank stock after the lender’s fiscal third quarter results, looking past a profit miss driven by one-off provisions, while pointing to steady operating trends, stable margins and an improving deposit trajectory. The extension of CEO Sandeep Bakhshi’s tenure also emerged as a key positive, removing a lingering overhang on the stock. ICICI Bank reported a 4 percent year-on-year decline in standalone net profit to Rs 11,318 crore in Q3 FY26, as higher one-off provisions weighed on earnings. Net interest income rose 7.7 percent year-on-year, supported by stable margins of 4.3 percent, while loan growth remained healthy, led by the corporate segment. Asset quality improved during the quarter, with the gross NPA ratio easing to 1.53 percent, though elevated provisions tempered overall profitability. Ahead of the quarterly results, ICICI Bank share price fell 0.4 percent on Friday to end at Rs 1,413 on NSE. The stock has gained over 15 percent in the last one year, outperforming benchmark Nifty 50, which has returned less than 11 percent during the same period. ICICI Bank stock call: Brokerages bullish on growth Brokerages also pointed to loan growth led by the corporate and mortgage segments, improving deposit traction with a stable CASA ratio. CLSA reiterated its Outperform rating on ICICI Bank with a target price of Rs 1,700 per share, implying an upside of over 20 percent. CLSA said the Q3 profit before tax missed estimates by about 7 percent due to a one-time provision. Excluding this impact, the brokerage said the bank’s adjusted performance was largely in line with expectations. CLSA highlighted 4 percent quarter-on-quarter and 12 percent year-on-year loan growth, led by the corporate segment, while noting that margins remained stable at 4.3 percent. Deposit growth improved to 9 percent year-on-year, with the CASA ratio holding steady, and asset quality trends remained strong with improved slippage ratios. Also read | HDFC Bank stock outlook: Brokerages bullish after Q3 profit beat Jefferies maintained its Buy rating and raised its target price to Rs 1,730 per share, attributing the Q3 earnings miss to higher agricultural provisions and the impact of labour law-related costs. The brokerage said loan growth improved to 12 percent, driven by corporate and mortgage loans, while unsecured retail lending remained soft. Asset quality stayed stable, Jefferies said, adding that the two-year extension granted to CEO Sandeep Bakhshi until October 2028 provides continuity and clarity at the top. Bernstein, which has a more cautious stance, retained its Market Perform rating with a target price of Rs 1,550 per share. The brokerage acknowledged that the CEO’s re-appointment meaningfully reduces an overhang on the stock; but it flagged a weaker quarterly performance. Bernstein said loan and deposit growth trailed broader system trends, margins were flat quarter-on-quarter compared with improvements seen at peers, and a one-time spike in credit costs hurt profitability. It also noted that earnings per share declined on a year-on-year basis. Kotak Institutional Equities reiterated its Add rating and raised its target price to Rs 1,800 per share, noting that Q3 FY26 earnings declined around 4 percent year-on-year due to higher one-off provisions. Kotak said the extension of the CEO’s tenure until October 2028 removes uncertainty, while loan growth of about 10 percent year-on-year and deposit growth of around 8 percent year-on-year point to steady underlying momentum. The brokerage described operating profit growth as muted at about 3 percent year-on-year but said asset quality remained stable and the bank’s strong liability franchise continues to support its long-term outlook.

HDFC Bank stock call: Brokerages say 'buy' Brokerages stayed constructive on the stock even as they flagged moderating deposit growth and the need for stronger mobilisation to support a re-rating. CLSA reiterated its Outperform rating on HDFC Bank stock with a target price of Rs 1,200 per share, implying an upside of about 29 percent. The brokerage noted that the bank’s Q3 FY26 profit before tax was 5 percent ahead of estimates, aided by in-line pre-provision operating profit and lower-than-expected credit costs. Core operating profit came in 2 percent above expectations, driven by better net interest margins and cost control. CLSA highlighted an 8 basis point sequential expansion in margins, supported by lower deposit costs and the benefit of the CRR cut, even as loan growth at 2.7 percent quarter-on-quarter lagged its estimate. Deposit growth moderated to 12 percent year-on-year due to curtailment of wholesale deposits, though average CASA growth improved during the quarter.

Return on assets remained stable, it said. Jefferies reiterated its Buy call and raised a slightly higher target price of Rs 1,240 per share, after the bank reported profit ahead of estimates. While core profit was largely in line after adjusting for provision releases and one-offs, Jefferies said deposit growth of around 12 percent remains a concern. The brokerage noted management’s clarification that the bank exited costlier deposits to improve margins, adding that a pickup in deposit growth would be critical for reducing the loan-to-deposit ratio and supporting a re-rating of the stock. Asset quality remained stable, it added. Kotak Institutional Equities maintained an Add rating with a target price of Rs 1,050 per share, highlighting a 12 percent year-on-year growth in Q3 FY26 earnings.

The daily and monthly strength RSI is in positive territory, which signals rising strength. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 830, Rs 900 Stop-Loss: Rs 760 Osho Krishan, Chief Manager - Technical & Derivative Research at Angel One IDBI Bank | CMP: Rs 104.55 IDBI Bank has experienced profit booking post the breakout over a multi-week resistance and has retested the neckline in the previous week. The technical structure remains robust, with the cycle of higher highs intact in the counter and the stock comfortably placed near the 20 DEMA. Additionally, the SuperTrend parameter indicates a bullish outlook, and the recent correction provides an opportunity to reiterate bullish positions from a short- to medium-term perspective. Hence, we recommend buying the stock around Rs 102–100. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 118, Rs 122 Stop-Loss: Rs 92 Inox Green Energy Services | CMP: Rs 189.38 Inox Green Energy has undergone a corrective phase of nearly 30 percent from its lifetime high post the formation of an ‘Inverted H&S’ on daily charts, and with the recent plunge, the counter has retested the neckline. Simultaneously, there has been a ‘bullish divergence’ between the RSI and price action, that too at the neckline and the 200 DSMA, suggesting the initiation of a counter-trend in the stock price in the near period. Hence, we recommend buying the stock around Rs 185–180. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 220, Rs 240 Stop-Loss: Rs 160 Mishra Dhatu Nigam | CMP: Rs 357.85 Mishra Dhatu Nigam has demonstrated substantial consolidation near its significant EMAs in the last couple of weeks. Additionally, the counter is in a ‘symmetrical triangle’ formation on the broader timeframe and witnessed a volume spurt near the lower band, which has pushed the counter to a higher zone in the recent period. Also, the technical indicators are strongly aligned with the price momentum, indicating a bullish outlook for the near term. Hence, we recommend buying the stock around Rs 350. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 385, Rs 400 Stop-Loss: Rs 320 Anshul Jain, Head of Research at Lakshmishree Investments Tech Mahindra | CMP: Rs 1,670.5 Backed by strong earnings, Tech Mahindra has broken out of a 46-week bullish VCP (volatility contraction pattern) structure near Rs 1,633, signaling a clear shift in trend strength. The stock closed right at the key resistance of Rs 1,684, highlighting this level as the immediate trigger zone. Volume expansion through the base and breakout confirms institutional participation, while rising daily and weekly moving averages underline improving momentum alignment. A sustained move above Rs 1,684 would unlock a sharper upmove toward the prior all-time high of Rs 1,756.85, which now looks more like a minor pause than a ceiling. Beyond that, the broader VCP pattern projects an extended upside toward the Rs 1,900 zone. Risk–reward remains favourable as long as the price holds above the breakout base, with pullbacks likely to be shallow and absorbed. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,900 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,600 HCL Technologies | CMP: Rs 1,698 HCL Technologies has confirmed a decisive breakout from a 29-week bullish cup-and-handle pattern near Rs 1,695, marking a clear trend acceleration. The standout feature is the right side of the pattern forming a tight flag, adding momentum fuel for bulls. The handle also represented the first controlled pullback into rising 10-, 20-, and 50-week moving averages, which are now acting as a strong launchpad. Breakout volumes have expanded sharply, signaling institutional participation and conviction. The price structure across timeframes remains constructive, with risk–reward favourably skewed higher. As long as the stock holds above the breakout zone, follow-through momentum can drive an initial move toward the Rs 1,825–1,938 band. Failure to sustain above the moving average cluster would be the key invalidation. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,825, Rs 1,938 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,640 Force Motors | CMP: Rs 20,565 Force Motors has delivered a clean breakout from a 20-week rectangle formation near Rs 20,500, signaling a resumption of its primary uptrend. The consolidation was constructive, with the price resting firmly on rising 10-, 20-, and 50-week moving averages, which have now aligned to form a strong launchpad. The breakout structure reflects absorption rather than distribution, keeping trend strength intact across timeframes. Volume behaviour remains supportive, indicating steady participation rather than speculative excess. As long as the stock sustains above the breakout zone, momentum is likely to extend further. The immediate upside projection points toward the Rs 22,500 zone, where partial resistance may emerge. Risk–reward remains favourable while the price holds above the rectangle base, with any pullback toward rising averages expected to attract demand rather than trigger supply. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 22,500 Stop-Loss: Rs 19,500","Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 6,200, Rs 6,450 Stop-Loss: Rs 5,650 UPL | CMP: Rs 790.15 For the past couple of years, UPL has been trending higher, forming a series of higher tops and bottoms, indicating a sustained uptrend.","Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 142, Rs 155 Stop-Loss: Rs 128 JK Cement | CMP: Rs 5,885 With a weekly closing, JK Cement has confirmed a past 6–7 weeks’ down-sloping trendline breakout at Rs 5,750 levels on a closing basis, indicating a short-term trend reversal.","It has also surpassed the multiple resistance zone of Rs 126 levels on a closing basis, along with huge volumes, indicating increased participation.","Simultaneously, there has been a ‘bullish divergence’ between the RSI and price action, that too at the neckline and the 200 DSMA, suggesting the initiation of a counter-trend in the stock price in the near period."
Broader indices underperform but these 27 small-cap stocks gain up to 62%,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/broader-indices-underperform-but-these-27-small-cap-stocks-gain-up-to-62-13776730.html,"Broader indices lagged the benchmarks during the week, with mid- and small-cap indices extending losses for a second straight week, declining up to 0.4 percent. For the week, BSE Sensex index fell 5.89 points at 83570.35, while Nifty50 index rose 11.05 points or 0.04 percent at 25694.35. Sectorally, Nifty Consumer Durables, Realty, Pharma, Healthcare shed 2 percent each, Nifty Auto index slipped 1.75 percent and Nifty Media index down 1 percent during the week. On the other hand, Nifty PSU Bank, Metal added 4.5% each and Nifty IT index rose 2.8%. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) extended their selling in this week also as they offloaded equities worth Rs 14,265.58 crore. In contrast, Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) provided support to the market, purchasing equities worth RS 16,173.69 crore. ""The Indian equity markets experienced a range-bound trading week, with the benchmark index oscillating within the confines of its 50 and 100-day EMAs. Despite heightened intraday volatility and sharp swings in both directions, the Nifty50 concluded the truncated week on a subdued note, settling a tad below the 25700 mark and registering a marginal weekly gain of 0.04%,"" said Osho Krishan, Chief Manager -Technical and Derivative research at Angel One. ""The shortened trading week was eventful, influenced by a mix of global and domestic developments. Persistent concerns around trade tariffs and escalating geopolitical tensions continued to weigh on investor sentiment, fostering a cautious market environment. At the same time, ongoing quarterly earnings announcements and key macroeconomic data provided selective opportunities across sectors. Despite these headwinds, the market exhibited notable resilience. The Nifty50 index managed to contain downside risks, holding near the key EMA on the daily charts, underscoring the underlying strength and consolidation phase in the broader market structure."" ""Going forward, it remains crucial to closely monitor global developments, particularly those related to trade tariffs and geopolitical tensions, as these factors are likely to act as significant catalysts in shaping near-term market trends. Additionally, several heavyweight constituents of the Nifty are scheduled to announce their earnings over the weekend, the impact of which is expected to be reflected in market action in the forthcoming sessions. In this backdrop, a prudent and disciplined approach is recommended, with market participants aligning their strategies around the aforementioned technical levels,"" he added. The BSE Small-cap index declined nearly 0.5 percent during the week. Stocks such as Genesys International Corporation, Nectar Lifesciences, GTPL Hathway, Universal Cables, Tejas Networks, InfoBeans Technologies, Lotus Chocolate Company, United Foodbrands, Amal, Igarashi Motors, Cohance Lifesciences, Globus Spirits and Jindal Poly Films fell between 10–18 percent. Meanwhile, Wardwizard Innovations and Mobility, JTL Industries, Antelopus Selan Energy, IFCI, Baazar Style Retail, Angel One, Dredging Corporation India, 3B BlackBio Dx, Neogen Chemicals and Antony Waste Handling Cell gained between 15–62 percent. Where is Nifty50 headed? Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities Nifty on the weekly chart formed a small bull candle with upper and lower shadow. Technically, this market action signal formation of high wave type candle pattern after a sharp weakness of previous week. This reflects ongoing volatility in the market. The underlying trend of Nifty remains choppy. A sustainable move above 25900 could open further upside for the next week. However, a slide below the support of 25500 could trigger more downside in the market ahead. Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking The ongoing tussle around the medium-term moving average, the 100 DEMA near the 25,600 zone, is keeping participants cautious. The market is likely to take cues from the earnings announcements of key heavyweights such as Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank in early trade on Monday, which could determine the next directional move. Until then, participants are advised to maintain a selective, stock-specific approach, focusing on sectors showing relative strength such as IT, financials and metals, while adhering to disciplined risk management in the prevailing volatile environment. Amol Athawale, VP Technical Research, Kotak Securities We are of the view that the current market formation is volatile and non-directional, and the short-term activity indicating a non-directional trend is likely to continue in the near future. On the downside, 25,500/83000 and 25,400/82700 would act as key support zones, while the daily SMA (Simple Moving Average) at 25,950/84600 and the 20-day SMA at 26,000/84800 would be crucial resistance levels for the bulls. For Bank Nifty, as long as it is trading above the 20-day SMA at 59,500, the uptrend is likely to continue. On the higher side, it could move up to 60,500. Further upside potential may lift the index up to 60,800. Conversely, if it falls below the 20-day SMA at 59,500, the uptrend would become vulnerable.

Wall Street ends little changed before long weekend,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/wall-street-ends-little-changed-before-long-weekend-13776717.html,"US stocks ended nearly flat on Friday in a choppy session ahead of the long weekend, and all three major indexes ​posted losses for the week as fourth-quarter earnings season kicked off. Healthcare fell 0.8% and led declines for the day among S&P ‌500 sectors. Shares of chipmakers rose, with an index of semiconductors gaining 1.2% and extending gains from Thursday. Big U.S. banks posted mostly solid results this week as the S&P 500 reporting period got under way. Still, shares of banks and other financial institutions have been pressured by worries over U.S. President Donald Trump's proposed one-year cap on credit card interest rates at 10%. The S&P 500 financial sector ended up 0.1% on Friday but posted its biggest weekly percentage decline since October. Investors also ‌digested news that Trump said he may want to keep economic adviser Kevin Hassett in his current role, lowering ​market bets that Hassett would succeed Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. ""To finish the week around flat with the S&P 500 still within spitting distance of 7,000 - most investors will take that as a win two weeks into the year,"" said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial. ""One of ‍the other reasons markets have been flat-lining is we're at the start of the earnings season,"" he said. ""Bank earnings are showing a generally favorable economic and business backdrop. Now we're going to start seeing other companies tied to other sectors, and that's going to give us a better take on fundamental conditions.""

For the week, the S&P 500 was down 0.38%, the Nasdaq declined 0.66% and the Dow fell 0.29%. The earnings season ramps up next week with reports from heavyweights ‌including Netflix, ‌Johnson & Johnson and Intel. Investors were also cautious of making big bets ahead of the long weekend, with the stock market shut on Monday for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. While stocks have largely traded in a relatively tight range in recent sessions, some options market participants expect more choppy price action in coming days following Friday's monthly options expiration. ""Historically the middle part of January tends to be pretty choppy,"" said Bruce Zaro, managing director at Granite Wealth ⁠Management in Plymouth, Massachusetts. ""Once we work our ⁠way through that, then we ​are likely to see a little bit better performance out to the end of the month. Hopefully, we'll find the month positive,"" which could suggest positive performance for the year, Zaro said.

Can IT sector see market re-rating amid positive AI commentary by Infosys after TCS? Analysts say 'evidence of monetisation' needed,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/can-it-sector-see-market-re-rating-amid-positive-ai-commentary-by-infosys-after-tcs-analysts-say-evidence-of-monetisation-needed-13776099.html,"IT stocks saw significant surge on December 16, buoyed by the positive October-December quarter results and management commentary on artificial intelligence (AI) progress by heavyweight Infosys. Analysts have commented on whether the sharp rebound in IT stocks can lead to a market re-rating and take them to fresh highs. Infosys shares closed around 6 percent higher, leading gains on the Nifty IT index which rose more than 3 percent to a three-week high of 39,086.65. Notably, the IT index was the worst performing sector in 2025, falling around 15 percent during the year overall. Infosys Q3 Results: Infosys reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 6,654 crore for Q3 FY26, marking a 2.2 percent year-on-year (YoY) fall from the Rs 6,806 crore net profit reported in Q3 FY25. This however included Rs 1,289-crore one-time cost on account of new labour codes. The IT major’s revenue from operations meanwhile rose 9 percent YoY to Rs 45,479 crore. The company revised its fiscal ending 2026 revenue growth forecast upwards to 3-3.5 percent, from an earlier estimate of 2-3 percent. AI commentary: Infosys said it now has over 500 AI agents and is doing AI work with more than 90 percent of its top 200 clients, as it pitches itself as an ""AI partner of choice"" for large enterprises. ""They are using agents in several of our service lines to help enhance either growth or productivity,"" CEO and managing director Salil Parekh said during the company's post-earnings press conference on January 14. Infosys is well placed to benefit from enterprise-wide AI spending, given its discretionary heavy mix, said Motilal Oswal Financial Services, which retained its 'Buy' call on the stock. At the current valuations, upside risks meaningfully outweigh downside risks, it added, while keeping a target price of Rs 2,200 per share for the stock, which implies a 37 percent upside potential from the previous closing price. Infosys's push for vendor consolidation is boosting growth prospects, while its AI library is strengthening its position as clients expand account sizes during renewals, Morningstar said.""Infosys is in a better competitive position compared with other Indian IT consulting firms due to its comprehensive AI offerings,"" the brokerage added. Infosys, which won AI-led deals with Adobe and Siemens AG in 2025, did not disclose revenue from AI projects. Last month, Accenture beat first-quarter revenue estimates on strong demand for AI-driven IT services. Tata Consultancy Services' annualised AI revenue jumped 17.3 percent sequentially to $1.8 billion, outpacing its December quarter growth of 1.96 percent. ""The growth momentum we witnessed in Q2 FY26 continued in Q3 FY26. We remain steadfast in our ambition to become the world’s largest AI-led technology services company, guided by a comprehensive five-pillar strategy,"" CEO and managing director K Krithivasan said. HCLTech said its AI revenue came in at $146 million, up from $100 million in the previous quarter. Revenue from the company's banking and technology verticals rose by 8.1 percent and 14.4 percent respectively, while that from life sciences fell 2 percent during the quarter. Earlier this week, Motilal Oswal said it expects AI-related deal conversion to begin to show up in revenue in H2 FY27. This is also when AI-linked productivity deflation begins to be offset by new AI services work. The firm sees large-cap revenue growth rates starting to improve toward the 6-7 percent range, and AI services moving into the full deployment mode by FY28. Industry revenue growth rates materially will likely accelerate to 8-9 percent (as against today's 3–4 percent) as AI modernisation, data workloads, and enterprise integration scale up, the domestic brokerage said, adding that this supports a sector-wide rerating as growth visibility improves. HDFC Securities meanwhile said that AI will remain a dominant factor shaping economic and market conditions going forward, and AI-led recovery will likely accelerate in H2 2026 after a muted H1 for the Indian IT sector. According to a new research survey by Capgemini Research, after an era of 'AI hype', business leaders are now increasingly realistic and pragmatic about their AI strategies, and have started using it in their decision-making. Can IT rebound lead to markets re-rating? IT stocks carry a significant share in benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty, and are closely tracked by investors globally. Strong earnings from Infosys could act as a short-term sentiment booster for the broader market as a positive earnings outcome and a better outlook help signal that demand conditions in key overseas markets may be stabilising, which supports overall risk appetite, said Ravi Singh, Chief Research Officer at Master Capital Services. As confidence builds, this could lead to short-term momentum not only in IT but also in other industries, the analyst said. However, for this to result in long-term market strength, comparable earnings traction must also be seen in other heavyweight sectors, according to Singh. ""If not, the effects of optimism driven by IT are probably going to be more tactical than systemic,"" he added. ""Although the long-term growth is reinforced by companies like Infosys and TCS's increased focus on AI, it is unlikely to lead to a broad-based valuation re-rating in a short time. Before allocating higher multiples, markets typically wait for stronger evidence of profit, margin growth and steady earnings contribution from AI-led deals,"" Singh said. 'Markets need to see consistent performance in AI space': For a rerating, markets need to see consistent quarter performance in the AI space, including tangible deals and acquisitions, said Shravan Shetty, Managing Director at Primus Partners, who added that the earnings commentary and forward guidance would need to point towards this. Narendra Solanki, Head Fundamental Research - Investment Services at Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers, however noted that with Infosys results, there has been a visible shift in the sentiments in the IT space and markets are expecting similar momentum from other companies. ""IT sector has decent weights in frontline indices and definitely may lead the indices in near term. However, scaling towards fresh highs alone on back if IT sector is possible but difficult at this juncture and need participation from other heavy weights as well,"" he added. Will strong results trigger re-rating for IT stocks? Speaking on whether the strong results will drive a re-rating for IT stocks, Harshal Dasani, Business Head at INVasset PMS, said that AI commentary is directionally constructive, but a full rerating needs evidence of monetisation, not just intent. ""In the near term, AI is more likely to drive a ‘selective rerating’ within IT rather than a blanket multiple expansion. Companies with higher exposure to short-cycle, ROI-led AI work and strong platform partnerships may see faster earnings revisions, while others may remain range-bound. The rerating trigger for the sector will be consistent: rising AI contribution to deal wins, expanding wallet share in core verticals like BFSI, and confirmation that GenAI is incremental rather than cannibalising legacy work. So yes, AI can change the slope of the cycle—but it is still early, and the market will demand proof through numbers over the next 2–3 quarters,"" Dasani said. Axis Securities remained 'cautiously optimistic' for the Indian IT sector. It noted that Infosys’ sequential growth trajectory suggests a stable environment rather than an improving one.",Will strong results trigger re-rating for IT stocks?,"'Markets need to see consistent performance in AI space': For a rerating, markets need to see consistent quarter performance in the AI space, including tangible deals and acquisitions, said Shravan Shetty, Managing Director at Primus Partners, who added that the earnings commentary and forward guidance would need to point towards this.","""They are using agents in several of our service lines to help enhance either growth or productivity,"" CEO and managing director Salil Parekh said during the company's post-earnings press conference on January 14.","'Markets need to see consistent performance in AI space': For a rerating, markets need to see consistent quarter performance in the AI space, including tangible deals and acquisitions, said Shravan Shetty, Managing Director at Primus Partners, who added that the earnings commentary and forward guidance would need to point towards this."

The Nifty Realty index gained more than 2 percent to hit intraday high of 867.65 on Friday, before paring some gains. The index closed 0.35 percent higher at 853. Top realty gainers: Prestige Estates were the top gainer on the index, rising nearly 2 percent to trade at Rs 1,524.10 apiece. This comes after the company announced that it has recorded pre-sales worth Rs 4,183.6 crore during the October-December quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026, marking a 30 percent YoY growth. For the April-December period, the company’s pre-sales surged 122 percent YoY to Rs 22,327.3 crore, marking the highest sales ever achieved by the company and surpassing its previous full-year peak sales. The firm also announced the launch of Evergreen at Prestige Raintree Park in Whitefield, Bengaluru. Macrotech Developers (Lodha), Oberoi Realty and Godrej Properties shares followed, rising around 1 percent each. Godrej Properties on January 15 announced that it has emerged as the largest listed residential real estate developer in India in 2025 for the second consecutive year, based on key operating metrics of booking value and cash collections. The firm sold 16,428 homes with a total saleable area of 27.26 million sq. ft. in 2025, supported by 41 successful project launches across India. Its booking value grew 19 percent YoY to Rs 34,171 crore with a CAGR of nearly 44 percent between 2022 and 2025. Bucking the trend, Anant Raj, DLF, Brigade Enterprises and Phoenix Mills shares were trading in the red with marginal losses. Sobha shares however fell more than 1 percent. Are IT layoffs behind the recent downturn? Indian IT sector has seen mass layoffs last year, which have now spilled over to this year. According to analysts, the IT layoffs have impacted housing demand in key areas, thereby impacting the stocks. IT layoffs are likely to be the major reason for the low demand in the luxury segment of urban centers like Bangalore and Hyderabad as they will be discouraging the high-income buyers, said Shashank Gupta, Director, RPS Group. He added that mid-to-premium housing sales, which have already dropped 15 percent year-on-year, will continue to be affected negatively as the professionals will not be willing to upgrade, opting instead to rent amid such job uncertainties. ""The market has whispered to the executives with Nifty Realty down by 20% from the peaks and talking about the disruption posed by the AI, which also indicates that 30% of the IT jobs that are luxury demand would get stifled due to the automation by 2027. The stock corrections that are expected to be around 5-7% are dependent on the RBI rate cuts and policy revamps that could fuel the market by the second quarter of 2026,"" the analyst said. Keshav Mangla, GM Business Development at Forteasia Realty, cited Anarock data to explain that financial tech layoffs of more than 1 lakh since 2024 have already resulted in a 12 percent drop in the demand for Tier-1 cities, thus resulting in developers' difficulties in managing cash flows and having to sell off their inventory.

The selling pressure pulled down the Nifty Defence index by up to 1 percent, snapping its previous session’s gains. Out of the 18 stocks in the index, only four were trading in the green. Market participants attributed the decline to profit taking after a short-term, news-driven reaction. Sunny Agrawal, Head of Fundamental Research at SBI Securities, said ""Defence stocks have corrected due to easing geopolitical concerns; however, this is largely a short-term, news-driven reaction. From a long-term perspective, the ability of defence companies to deliver healthy earnings growth remains intact. I do not believe that any easing of geopolitical tensions will lead to a reduction in India’s defence budget. While there may be a temporary sentimental impact due to improved geopolitical conditions, the long-term growth potential continues to remain very strong. Any dip should be viewed as a buying opportunity in quality defence stocks for long-term investors."" Trump said he had been informed that killings during Iran’s crackdown on protests were easing and that there was no current plan for large-scale executions. He adopted a wait-and-see approach after earlier threatening intervention. Antigovernment protests across Tehran have eased since Monday, when hundreds of thousands of people attended pro-government demonstrations. Iran has also reopened its airspace after a nearly five-hour closure that had disrupted flights across the region amid concerns over possible military action. According to people inside Iran contacted by Reuters on Wednesday and Thursday, protests appeared to have abated since Monday. On the stock-specific front, Astra Microwave Products emerged as the biggest laggard in the Nifty Defence index, sliding up to 3 percent.

"HPCL, BPCL, IOC shares jump up to 4% over oil price decline as US-Iran tensions ease",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/hpcl-bpcl-ioc-shares-jump-up-to-4-as-oil-prices-decline-after-trump-assures-iran-of-no-us-strike-13775703.html,"The shares of oil marketing companies (OMC) jumped in trade on January 16 as oil prices extended decline. This came as concerns around supply risks eased amid lower expectations of a US strike on Iran. Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) shares surged nearly 4 percent to trade at Rs 456.50 apiece, snapping a two-session losing streak. Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) shares meanwhile rose over 3 percent to Rs 367.75 apiece, and Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) shares gained around 2 percent to Rs 162.15 apiece. Why are oil prices falling? Oil prices have extended losses after US President Donald Trump signaled that he may hold off on attacking Iran for now. He said that he has been assured that Iran would stop killing protesters, reducing the likelihood of an immediate US military response to the demonstrations against the government of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and of disruptions to Iranian production and key shipping lanes. ""Despite the steady drumbeat of geopolitical risks and macro speculation, the underlying balance still points to ample supply ... unless we see a genuine revival in Chinese demand or a meaningful bottleneck in physical barrel flows, oil looks range-bound, with Brent broadly hovering between $57 and $67,” Reuters quoted Phillip Nova senior market analyst Priyanka Sachdeva as saying. Brent crude fell more than 4 cents to $63.72. Analysts however have advised caution, highlighting the volatility still remains high. ""While (Iranian supply) risks have eased somewhat, they remain significant, keeping the market nervous in the short term,"" IG analysts said in a client note, cited by Reuters. How will OMCs perform in Q3? The state-run OMCs are likely to register strong Q3 results on the back of healthy refining margins, according to analysts. In the Oct-December quarter of FY26, average oil prices declined by 6 percent on a sequential basis and 10 percent from the same period last year, while retail prices were unchanged. “Due to elevated product cracks, refining margins will be sharply higher and implied marketing earnings weaker,” Kotak Institutional Equities said in its report. Motilal Oswal expects the standalone EBITDA for Hindustan Petroleum, Bharat Petroleum, and Indian Oil to increase 9-18 percent on a sequential basis, due to strong refining margins and receipt of LPG compensation.

"IT stocks surge up to 6% on strong Infosys Q3 results, Nifty IT index hits three-week high",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/it-stocks-surge-up-to-6-on-strong-infosys-q3-results-nifty-it-index-hits-three-week-high-13775632.html,"The shares of IT companies jumped in trade on January 16 as strong Q3 earnings of Infosys boosted investor sentiment. The Nifty IT index jumped more than 3 percent to 39,099.95, emerging as the top sectoral gainer on the market today. The index which was the worst performing sector in 2025, has now recorded the sharpest gains in three weeks. Infosys Q3 Results: Infosys shares led gains, jumping nearly 6 percent to trade at Rs 1,693 apiece. This comes after Infosys reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 6,654 crore for Q3 FY26, marking a 2.2 percent year-on-year (YoY) fall from the Rs 6,806 crore net profit reported in Q3 FY25. This however included Rs 1,289-crore one-time cost on account of new labour codes. The IT major’s revenue from operations meanwhile rose 9 percent YoY to Rs 45,479 crore. The company revised its fiscal ending 2026 revenue growth forecast upwards to 3-3.5 percent, from an earlier estimate of 2-3 percent. Other IT gainers today: Oracle Financial Services Software and LTIMindtree shares gained more than 5 percent each. Notably, LTIMindtree said it has been awarded the Insight 2.0 project by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) to build an AI-powered programme for the modernisation of India’s national tax analytics platform. The project, which is expected to be completed within seven years, is valued at around Rs 3,000 crore. Tech Mahindra and Mphasis shares gained around 5 percent each, while Wipro shares were up more than 3 percent. Tech Mahindra and Wipro are set to release their results for the October-December quarter of the ongoing FY26 later today. Persistent Systems and Coforge shares gained around 3 percent, while Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and HCLTech shares rose over 2 percent each. What lies ahead for IT sector? Axis Securities remained ‘cautiously optimistic’ for the Indian IT sector. It noted that Infosys’ sequential growth trajectory suggests a stable environment rather than an improving one. “From a near-term perspective, global uncertainties will keep overall growth muted. However, the company’s core efficiencies, investments, and deal momentum across regions will support the overall business over the next couple of quarters,” the domestic brokerage said. Infosys’ latest print matters because it is less about a one-quarter beat and more about a demand inflection signal, said Harshal Dasani Business Head INVasset PMS. The analyst said that the company raising its guidance and positive management commentary came at time when the market was questioning the durability of the IT cycle. That helped lift the Nifty IT index meaningfully in today’s session and provided a sentiment tailwind to the broader market. “The setup is encouraging because IT valuations had become more reasonable after underperformance, and even modest upgrades can trigger short-covering. However, a sustained index breakout needs earnings breadth beyond IT—financials, consumption, and industrial capex must also deliver. So, Infosys can be a catalyst for confidence, but new highs are ultimately a function of aggregate earnings visibility and global liquidity,” he added. A positive earnings outcome and a better outlook help signal that demand conditions in key overseas markets may be stabilizing, which supports overall risk appetite, said Ravi Singh, Chief Research Officer at Master Capital Services. He added that as confidence builds, this could lead to short-term momentum not only in IT but also in other industries.

Focus on expanding hotels (segmental GTV up ~16.6% y/y in H1FY26 vs. overall ~7.2% y/y GTV growth), international market presence (added 23 countries in the last 18 months), signs of stabilisation in India business (expecting high-single-to-early-double-digit y/y growth in Q3 and thereafter vs. flat-to-declining y/y trajectory in last 3-5 quarters), increased contribution from new travel agents (~6.9% of GTV in H1FY26 vs. ~4.3% in H1FY25) would be key enablers. We also expect EBITDA margin to expand from Q4 onwards, as investment in key account managers taper off with operating leverage kicking in amid y/y slowdown in SG&A growth. Outlook Thus, incorporating Classic Vacations from H2FY26 (contributing ~10% to consol. GTV), we retain BUY rating on TBO Tek with an upwardly revised TP of Rs2,000 (from Rs1,725 earlier), valuing it at ~41x FY28e EPS (vs ~46x Sep’27e EPS earlier).

MF yield improved slightly QoQ to 47.6bps despite equity growth while share of non-MF revenue was stable at ~9.0%. Led by strong equity performance in 1/3-yr buckets, market share in net equity flows remains highest at 18.2% in 9MFY26 (15.2% in FY25). Hence stock market share in equity increased by 28bps QoQ to 13.9%. ICICIAMC could better navigate the impact of 5bps TER reduction due to lower commission payout and lesser ND share in equity distribution. Conservatively, we have factored a 2.0-3.0bps decline in equity yields over FY26-28E (vs no fall in FY26). Re-appointment of Mr. Sankaran Naren as the Executive Director for a term of 2 years, w.e.f. 1st Jul’26 to 30th Jun’28 mitigates the KMP risk.

As a part of the restructuring exercise, 1,563 operating rooms of Lemon Tree will be transferred to Fleur.

The carved-out units were majorly a part of Hi-Tech segment, ex-Hi-Tech growth stood at ~1.1% QoQ in USD. The management has laid out 5-year strategy (“Lakshya”) to doubling down on high growth areas and focus on quality revenues, while eliminating commoditized play. We believe the strategy is margin accretive from the quarter itself, but plugging the topline gaps would be challenging in the near-term, where Sustainability remains the only growth engine. Outlook Despite the strategic move, the milestone to achieve ~16% margin remains intact. We are building in 5.0%/3.5/9.0% CC revenue growth, while estimating margins at 13.9%/15.2%/15.7% for FY26E/FY27E/FY28E.

While the period-end client funding book remained flat, the average client funding book grew 11 percent quarter-on-quarter, leading to strong interest income, the brokerage added.

The global brokerage Jefferies recommended a ""Buy"" rating to the stock, increasing the price target to Rs 195 from Rs 190. It said that the new ventures are ramping up faster than expected.

LTIMindtree stock surged to a high of around Rs 6,290 in late-morning deals, up about 4.3 percent for the day. The rally pushed the stock to its session high and came amid strong volumes in the IT pack. At current levels, LTIMindtree commands a market capitalisation of about Rs 1.86 lakh crore. Even after Friday’s surge, the stock is up just under 5 percent over the past one year. It has underperforming the Nifty 50, which has gained around 11 percent over the same period. In a press release filed with the stock exchanges, the company said it has been awarded the Insight 2.0 project by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) to build an AI-powered programme for the modernisation of India’s national tax analytics platform. The mandate is valued at around Rs 3,000 crore and spans seven years, providing long-term revenue visibility. The project will focus on deploying advanced digital architecture and data analytics. Investors appeared to react positively to both the size and duration of the deal, with the order reinforcing LTIMindtree’s credentials in the public sector. The long contract tenor was also seen as supportive for medium-term earnings visibility. Friday’s move in LTIMindtree also played out against a stronger backdrop for IT stocks more broadly. Buying interest picked up across the sector after Infosys stock surged more than 5 percent, its biggest single-day gain in about four months, following its Q3 FY26 results and an upward revision in revenue growth guidance. The improved sentiment triggered both fresh buying and short-covering in several IT names, lending additional support to LTIMindtree’s rally. From a valuation standpoint, LTIMindtree trades at a TTM price-to-earnings multiple of about 38.2, with a dividend yield of roughly 1 percent, metrics that have kept the stock in focus for investors assessing risk-reward after a period of relative underperformance versus the broader market.

L&T stock was trading 1.02 percent higher at Rs 3,905.4 in morning trade on NSE. At current levels, the stock is up about 11.3 percent over the past one year, broadly in line with the Nifty 50’s gains. The company commands a market capitalisation of around Rs 5.36 lakh crore. L&T stock trades at a price-to-earnings multiple of about 32.7 times. In an exchange filing on Friday, L&T said its hydrocarbon onshore business vertical has secured a large order from Petronet LNG, a joint venture promoted by ONGC, Indian Oil, GAIL and BPCL. The project will be executed on a lump-sum turnkey basis and involves engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning of LNG/ethane and propane double-wall storage tanks at the Dahej petrochemical complex in Gujarat. The scope of work includes a 170,000 cubic metre LNG/ethane storage tank and a 140,000 cubic metre propane storage tank, along with ethane and propane handling and despatch facilities to support the downstream propane dehydrogenation and polypropylene plant. L&T classified the contract as a ‘large’ order, implying a value in the range of Rs 2,500 crore to Rs 5,000 crore. The project forms part of India’s first petrochemical complex integrating cold energy utilisation from an LNG terminal and is aimed at strengthening domestic petrochemical manufacturing capacity. Friday’s order announcement comes after L&T earlier this week sought to reassure investors over reports related to possible cancellation of oil project tenders in Kuwait. The company had clarified that the projects referred to in those media reports were not part of its order book, following which the stock had pared intraday losses. L&T has also remained in focus in recent sessions after announcing another ‘large’ order earlier this week for its heavy civil infrastructure business, involving the construction of India’s largest pumped storage project in Maharashtra.

"Cipla stock crashes over 3% as brokerages cut targets on Lanreotide disruption, FY27 risks",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/cipla-stock-crashes-over-3-as-brokerages-cut-targets-on-lanreotide-disruption-fy27-risks-13775001.html,"Shares of Cipla Ltd fell sharply on Friday and extended recent weakness, after a series of cautious brokerage notes flagged earnings risks from supply disruptions in its key US product Lanreotide and intensifying competition in other generics. Cipla stock dropped 3.48 percent to Rs 1,384.6 in early trade. The stock is now down about 4 percent over the past one year, sharply underperforming the Nifty 50, which has risen over 10 percent during the same period. The decline comes after Cipla disclosed that manufacturing of Lanreotide has been temporarily paused to support USFDA remediation at its European contract manufacturing partner. Lanreotide is among Cipla’s top three products in the US and accounts for about $150 million in annual revenue, with the company holding a 22 percent market share in the product. Morgan Stanley maintained its Underweight stance on the stock and cut its target price to Rs 1,292 per share. The brokerage warned that the phase-out of gRevlimid and supply disruptions in Lanreotide are likely to weigh on performance, particularly in Q4 FY26. It trimmed earnings estimates by 2 percent for FY26 and 1 percent for FY27, cautioning that any prolonged disruption could result in market share loss and downside risk to FY27 and FY28 earnings. Nuvama also turned more cautious, downgrading Cipla to Reduce and lowering its target price to Rs 1,360 per share. Nuvama said the expiry of gRevlimid exclusivity, uncertainty around Lanreotide supplies, and rising competition for Cipla’s proposed generic Advair following a recent approval for Lannett pose an earnings challenge for FY27. The brokerage noted that Cipla’s European contract manufacturer Pharmathen has temporarily paused production for remediation, with manufacturing expected to restart only in the first half of FY27, adding near-term uncertainty. Cipla has said that the Lanreotide manufacturing halt is linked to remediation efforts following a US Food and Drug Administration inspection at Pharmathen’s Rodopi facility in Greece, which resulted in nine observations. The company has indicated that resupply of Lanreotide is expected to resume in the first half of FY27 and that it is closely monitoring supply levels. Not all brokerages are bearish. Nomura believes the potential loss of Lanreotide sales has largely been priced in, noting that the stock is already down about 6.5 percent since the issue first came to light earlier this month. Nomura has maintained a Buy rating with a target price of Rs 1,770. However, the dominant tone around Cipla remains cautious.

"Infosys shares jump over 5% after Q3 results; brokerages upbeat on guidance hike, deal wins",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/infosys-shares-jump-over-4-after-q3-results-brokerages-upbeat-on-guidance-hike-deal-wins-13774937.html,"Shares of Infosys Ltd rallied sharply on Friday, rising over 5 percent, as investors reacted positively to the IT major’s Q3 FY26 results, a raised revenue growth outlook, and upbeat brokerage commentary following a strong rally in its US-listed ADRs. Infosys stock climbed 5.14 percent to a high or Rs 1,682.1 in early trade, marking a firm rebound after the company’s earnings announcement earlier this week. The stock had ended the previous session at Rs 1,608.9 on the NSE. The buying interest comes despite Infosys reporting a 2.2 percent year-on-year decline in consolidated net profit for the fiscal third quarter, which was weighed down by a one-time labour code-related charge. Investors appeared to look past the headline profit miss, focusing instead on steady constant-currency revenue growth, resilient adjusted margins, and robust large-deal momentum. Infosys raised its FY26 revenue growth guidance to 3-3.5 percent in constant currency terms, citing improving demand visibility and strong execution, while maintaining its operating margin outlook. Large deal wins stood at $4.8 billion during the quarter, including two mega deals, supporting medium-term revenue visibility. Sentiment was also supported by a sharp rally in Infosys’ American Depository Receipts, which jumped about 8 percent over two US trading sessions following the results, signalling a positive offshore investor response. Brokerages reiterated bullish views on the stock after the earnings announcement.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Hindustan Zinc, Punjab National Bank, Tata Steel, MCX India, Laurus Labs, and others on January 16?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-hindustan-zinc-punjab-national-bank-tata-steel-mcx-inida-laurus-labs-and-others-on-january-16-13774581.html,"Equity benchmarks recorded a one-third percent loss, continuing the downtrend for the second consecutive session on January 14, with moderately weakening market breadth. A total of 1,498 shares saw selling pressure compared to 1,385 shares that gained on the NSE. The market may remain range-bound until it decisively breaks the current week’s high–low range. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Nilesh Jain, Head – Technical and Derivatives Research Analyst (Equity Research) at Centrum Broking Hindustan Zinc | CMP: Rs 654.2 Hindustan Zinc continues to remain in a strong uptrend, consistently forming higher tops and higher bottoms. It is trading well above both short-term and long-term moving averages, indicating sustained strength. After witnessing consolidation over the past couple of weeks, the stock has now delivered a fresh breakout, which is supported by higher-than-average volumes, reinforcing the bullish outlook. From a derivatives perspective, the addition of fresh long positions further strengthens the positive bias. Considering the overall technical setup, the stock appears well-positioned to move towards the Rs 700 level in the near term, while crucial support is placed at Rs 621. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 700 Stop-Loss: Rs 621 Punjab National Bank | CMP: Rs 128.68 Punjab National Bank gave a fresh breakout from an ascending triangle pattern on the daily chart. It surpassed double-top resistance and ended at 52-week highs. The sharp price up-move is backed by significantly higher volumes, which validates the bullish setup. Momentum indicators are also supportive, with the RSI moving above the 65 mark and the MACD generating a bullish crossover, indicating improving upward momentum. Overall, the technical structure suggests the stock is well placed to move towards the Rs 140 level in the near term, while immediate support is seen near Rs 123. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 140 Stop-Loss: Rs 123 Polycab India | CMP: Rs 7,323.5 Polycab India earlier formed a double-top pattern and has since been making lower highs and lower lows, indicating a weakening price structure. It has also slipped below all its key short-term moving averages, reinforcing the bearish bias. Currently, the stock is on the verge of breaking down from its rising trendline, with immediate support placed near Rs 7,250. A decisive breach below this level could accelerate selling pressure and drag the stock towards the Rs 6,800 zone. The bearish outlook would be invalidated only if the stock manages to sustain a move above Rs 7,560 on the upside. From a derivatives perspective, the presence of fresh short build-up further supports the negative view.

"Vishal Sikka warns of AI valuation gap, urges Indian IT to evolve",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/vishal-sikka-warns-of-ai-valuation-gap-urges-indian-it-to-evolve-alpha-article-13773914.html,"The current valuations in the artificial intelligence sector do not add up, creating a significant gap between capital expenditure and revenue generation, according to Vishal Sikka, founder and CEO of Vianai Systems. In an interview with CNBC TV18, Sikka -- former CEO of Infosys -- warned of a hype cycle, noting that the economics of the massive spending on AI infrastructure are not currently supported by revenues. Sikka explained the discrepancy by breaking down the numbers. He pointed out that while a company like Nvidia generates approximately $250 billion annually from its GPU sales, the total ecosystem spending, including CPUs, memory, and networking, swells this figure to about $750-$800 billion a year. To justify this expenditure over a four-year amortisation period, the industry would need to generate around $200 billion in new revenue. ""Where is the 200 billion? There is no 200 billion. OpenAI's revenue is 15 billion, something like that. And so there is a huge gap,"" Sikka stated. He questioned how long this gap would be funded, acknowledging that while one could call it a bubble, the current reality is that the economics ""don't add up to what has been spent."" Addressing the impact on India's information technology services sector, Sikka asserted that AI is already capable of effectively automating well-defined, structured activities such as software development, maintenance, and business process execution. This means a much smaller team equipped with AI can perform the work previously done by a larger group. He urged Indian IT companies to embrace this transformation, even if it leads to lower short-term economic gains. The key to navigating this shift, he advised, is for these firms to become software companies in addition to being services companies. ""It has to be your own software,"" he emphasized. By developing proprietary AI platforms, IT firms can retain value even as the number of billable hours for projects decreases. This necessitates a business model adjustment away from purely people-based pricing towards fixed-fee, outcome-based approaches that account for the value of the software itself. Looking at India's position in the global AI race, Sikka expressed strong optimism, citing the nation's ""demographic dividend."" He described AI as a powerful tool, much like others invented throughout human history, that can empower India's large, young, and educated population. ""The great mandate for us is how do we make all our people able to use these tools to build amazing things for themselves, for our country, but also for the world,"" he said. Sikka believes that if India can successfully equip its billion-strong population to use AI effectively, the country will thrive. Furthermore, Sikka called for greater participation in building foundational AI technologies within India. Dismissing the notion that the country has missed its opportunity, he compared the current stage of AI development to being in the ""first over of a T20 match."" He expressed a desire to see a great foundation model built in India and highlighted immense opportunities for innovation. Future advancements, according to Sikka, lie in creating vertical foundation models for specific industries like healthcare, models trained on India's diverse local languages, and sophisticated ""world models"" that can understand the physical world and activities specific to the Indian context, such as traffic patterns and infrastructure.","The current valuations in the artificial intelligence sector do not add up, creating a significant gap between capital expenditure and revenue generation, according to Vishal Sikka, founder and CEO of Vianai Systems.","Future advancements, according to Sikka, lie in creating vertical foundation models for specific industries like healthcare, models trained on India's diverse local languages, and sophisticated ""world models"" that can understand the physical world and activities specific to the Indian context, such as traffic patterns and infrastructure.","Addressing the impact on India's information technology services sector, Sikka asserted that AI is already capable of effectively automating well-defined, structured activities such as software development, maintenance, and business process execution.","Dismissing the notion that the country has missed its opportunity, he compared the current stage of AI development to being in the ""first over of a T20 match."""
"India must build its own AI foundational models, says Vishal Sikka",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/india-must-build-its-own-ai-foundational-models-says-vishal-sikka-alpha-article-13773915.html,"Vishal Sikka, founder & CEO of Vianai Systems, has called for India to urgently develop its own foundational artificial intelligence models to avoid becoming a passive consumer of technology built elsewhere. In an interview with CNBC TV18, Sikka -- former CEO of Infosys -- emphasised that India is too large and the stakes too high for the nation to be absent from any layer of the AI ecosystem. ""We have to be central to AI ... at every layer, in every aspect of AI,"" Sikka stated, ahead of the India AI impact summit scheduled for next month. He argued that India possesses the capability to use and deliver AI at scale and should showcase its innovation and entrepreneurial spirit to the world. He said India must build its own foundation models, develop tools and applications on top, and enable hundreds of millions to deploy them, which are the core underpinning for platforms like ChatGPT. The former Infosys CEO highlighted a critical skill gap as a major challenge, describing the current global situation as a ""tale of two cities."" He noted that out of eight billion people worldwide, only about two million can build AI applications. The number shrinks dramatically to a few hundred thousand who can deploy AI in production, and fewer than 25,000 people on the entire planet possess the skills to create a frontier-level foundational model. ""These are not skills that are pre-ordained by God for a chosen few people… we have to really make these skills much more pervasive,"" he said. To address this, Sikka, who is on the board of Stanford's AI center, revealed that the upcoming summit will feature faculty from the university who will teach attendees how to build their own foundational models, aiming to proliferate the skill of building foundation models, which he argued can be learned. Sikka outlined a twofold concern regarding India's AI readiness. The first is the urgency to expand the skill base of people who understand AI's capabilities and limitations. The second is the imminent disruptive effect on key industries, particularly the IT services sector. He pointed out that Large Language Models (LLMs) are ""unreasonably effective at writing software,"" posing a direct challenge to traditional software development and maintenance roles. ""We have a short window of time in which to transform from the previous way of doing things to an AI-led way of doing things,"" Sikka warned, framing it as the most important equation for the times ahead. He stressed that the disruption is not a future event but is already happening. To illustrate the magnitude of the shift, he shared an anecdote of a complex system that took 15 experts nine months to build being replicated by a single person in just 14 days using modern AI tools. ""It is not a matter of when is it coming. It is here already,"" he asserted. Reflecting on his early decision to back OpenAI with a donation in 2015, he recalled that allocating resources to high-reward, unconventional ideas like these often seem ‘crazy’ at first. He urged a focus on the future, questioning what current opportunities might be missed today that will seem obvious in 2035. For him, the most significant imminent transformation lies in the complete overhaul of the IT landscape driven by AI.","He said India must build its own foundation models, develop tools and applications on top, and enable hundreds of millions to deploy them, which are the core underpinning for platforms like ChatGPT.","To address this, Sikka, who is on the board of Stanford's AI center, revealed that the upcoming summit will feature faculty from the university who will teach attendees how to build their own foundational models, aiming to proliferate the skill of building foundation models, which he argued can be learned.","He urged a focus on the future, questioning what current opportunities might be missed today that will seem obvious in 2035.","To address this, Sikka, who is on the board of Stanford's AI center, revealed that the upcoming summit will feature faculty from the university who will teach attendees how to build their own foundational models, aiming to proliferate the skill of building foundation models, which he argued can be learned."

"Chartist Talk: Ashish Kyal shares outlook for Vedanta, Union Bank, NALCO, MCX, Hindustan Copper, IndusInd Bank after sharp rally",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/chartist-talk-ashish-kyal-shares-outlook-for-vedanta-union-bank-nalco-mcx-hindustan-copper-indusind-bank-after-sharp-rally-13773715.html,"According to Ashish Kyal, the CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors, Hindustan Copper is currently approaching prior swing high of Rs 575 after taking a short breather. “Break above Rs 575 can extend the rally further towards Rs 600-650 levels,” he said in an interview to Moneycontrol. On NALCO, which gained 4.5% in last session, he is of view that as long as the stock does not see a close below prior day’s low, upside momentum is expected to continue with the upside targets of Rs 400 level or higher. He also shared his technical outlook on Union Ban of India, Vedanta, IndusInd Bank and MCX India after their strong rally in the recent session. On the Nifty 50, he feels Friday closing will decide trend for coming week and key levels to watch out for are 25,470 – 25,850 levels. Do you expect the Nifty 50 to break out of the 25,600–25,900 range of the past four days on the upside? Nifty since past 7 days has been failing to give a positive close above prior day’s high. Prices are witnessing selling pressure on upside and not able to cross above 25,850 on closing basis which is also high volume profile area. It will be important to see a close above this level by end of day on Friday which is next working day for upside breakout. On downside, any close below 25,470 by day-end will be sign of concern. Friday closing will decide trend for coming week and key levels to watch out for are 25,470 – 25,850 levels. The Bank Nifty has hovered around short-term moving averages over the last few days. Do you see the possibility of the banking index moving toward record highs rather than witnessing sharp selling pressure? Bank Nifty is holding 50 period EMA (Exponential moving average) and index is currently consolidating near the EMA support in between a range of 58,800-59,800. Consistent rally in PSU banks have limited downside movement in the Index. A break above 59,800 level can open doors for the targets of 60,400 followed by 61,000 levels. While a close below 58,800 can suggest that short term top has formed. Do you expect the record-high rally to continue in Vedanta, Union Bank of India, and MCX India? Vedanta has hit record highs on strong rise in commodity prices. However, after a 13% rally since January 2026, RSI is overbought, so dips can be used to buy as long as there is no close below the prior day’s low, with upside targets of Rs 730 or higher over the coming months. PSU banks continued to outperform. In the previous session, Union Bank of India surged nearly 8% post good quarterly results, forming a strong bullish candle for the first time in months. As long as the stock holds above Rs 165 level, the bias remains positive for upside targets of Rs 190 level or higher. Since September, Multi Commodity Exchange of India (MCX India) has been protecting prior week’s low on closing basis keeping bigger trend on sides of bulls. So, as long as key support of Rs 2,180 level remains protected on the downside one can use every decline to buy with the upside target of Rs 2,600 followed by Rs 2,800 level. Are you super bullish on Hindustan Copper and NALCO? Global uncertainties have caused huge rally in commodities such as gold, silver, aluminium, and copper to reach all-time high levels. Hindustan copper and NALCO which are directly linked to these metals, so both companies are directly benefitting from this rally. Hindustan Copper is currently approaching prior swing high of Rs 575 after taking a short breather and now a break above the same can extend the rally further towards Rs 600-650 levels with Rs 540 followed Rs 520 as immediate support levels. While NALCO is currently trading at the uncharted territory and has shown a sharp rally of nearly 13% within past one week. For now, as long as we do not see a close below prior day’s low, upside momentum is expected to continue with the upside targets of Rs 400 level or higher. On the downside, Rs 350 can act as an immediate support. Any break below it can result into short term profit booking. Do you think the Nifty Auto index is done with its correction and is expected to resume its upward journey soon? Nifty Auto index has lost most of its gains from recent rally and continued to drift lower by protecting prior day’s high on closing basis. The sector is currently standing at 50 EMA support of 27,700 level. A close below the same can accelerate further selling pressure towards 27,480 followed by 27,180 level. On the upside, a break above 28,180 can trigger short covering. Do you see a cup-and-handle pattern breakout in IndusInd Bank? If yes, does it indicate that the rally will continue? Yes, on the daily chart, IndusInd Bank has confirmed a breakout from a cup-and-handle pattern, followed by a successful retest, and has also moved above its prior swing high. Notably, volumes have picked up sharply for the first time since November 12, 2025, indicating strong participation and conviction in the ongoing move. As long as Rs 890 level remains protected on the downside, the rally is likely to extend further towards Rs 1,000 or higher. Do you expect the record-high rally to continue in the Nifty PSU Bank index? Since past one year, PSU Bank index has shown a clear outperformance as compared to Private Bank as it has surged by 30% in one year and continued to trade in a uncharted territory. This strong relative momentum suggests that the outperformance trend is likely to persist. On the upside, the index has the potential to move towards 9,000, followed by 9,200 levels, while 8,650 level remains a crucial support to watch.",Hindustan Copper is currently approaching prior swing high of Rs 575 after taking a short breather and now a break above the same can extend the rally further towards Rs 600-650 levels with Rs 540 followed Rs 520 as immediate support levels.,"On NALCO, which gained 4.5% in last session, he is of view that as long as the stock does not see a close below prior day’s low, upside momentum is expected to continue with the upside targets of Rs 400 level or higher.",Nifty Auto index has lost most of its gains from recent rally and continued to drift lower by protecting prior day’s high on closing basis.,"On NALCO, which gained 4.5% in last session, he is of view that as long as the stock does not see a close below prior day’s low, upside momentum is expected to continue with the upside targets of Rs 400 level or higher."

Gaurav Garg, Lemonn Markets Desk The benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty witnessed sharp intraday volatility on Wednesday as caution prevailed amid sustained foreign fund outflows and global tariff-related concerns. After slipping to early lows, domestic markets pared most of their losses on the back of selective value buying and traded largely flat by mid-afternoon. The Sensex fell to a low of 83,185.20 before recovering nearly 350 points to trade at 83,505.56, down 0.15 percent, while the Nifty hovered near the 25,700 level at 25,692.30, lower by 0.16 percent. Buying interest emerged in pockets such as metals, oil and gas, and consumer durables, helping limit the downside after recent corrections. Market sentiment remains fragile, with both indices having declined in six of the last seven sessions amid concerns over US tariff measures, geopolitical tensions and persistent foreign portfolio outflows. FPIs have sold nearly ₹16,600 crore worth of equities so far in January, following heavy outflows in 2025. Additional volatility was driven by the advancement of the weekly derivatives expiry to Wednesday, while positive cues from Asian markets provided some support. From a technical perspective, the Nifty managed to hold above the 25,620–25,715 support zone. A sustained move above 25,715 could trigger a recovery towards 26,020, while a break below 25,600 may open the downside towards 25,300.

L&T shares extend fall as JM Financial trims firm's order inflow forecast on $8.7-bn Kuwait tender uncertainty,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/l-t-shares-extend-fall-as-jm-financial-trims-firm-s-order-inflow-forecast-on-8-7-bn-kuwait-tender-uncertainty-13772675.html,"JM Financial issued a cautious note for Larsen & Toubro (L&T), stating that the uncertainty around Kuwait reportedly cancelling a few tenders can cloud order inflow visibility for the engineering major. The shares of the company extended decline for the fifth consecutive session on January 14. Kuwait mulls cancellation of oil project tenders worth $8.7 bn, says report: Kuwait is discussing plans to cancel oil project tenders worth $8.7 billion, media company MEED reported citing people familiar with the matter. It added that Kuwait's discussions come after bids for several contracts came in well above the budget, raising concerns over cost efficiency and fiscal impact. According to analysts quoted by CNBC-TV18, L&T was the lowest bidder in tenders worth more than $4.5 billion. Moneycontrol couldn't independently verify the report. L&T clarifies: The company clarified that the said that the projects referred to in the media reports were not part of the company’s order book. ""Further, the Company can’t comment on the status of tenders or commercial decisions of its Clients,"" it added. JM Financial on L&T: In its note, JM Financial said it has noted earlier that L&T is well-placed in $5-billion worth of tenders in Kuwait. Thus, any potential delay or cancellation of these bids may adversely impact its order inflows, the domestic brokerage said. It still expects L&T to meet its FY26 order inflow growth guidance of 10 percent YoY due to the firm’s April-December order inflows of Rs 3.2 trillion and strong prospects for Q4 FY26. However, it cut its core order inflow estimates by 5-6 percent for FY26-28 to account for possible delay/cancellation in the Kuwait tenders. “This leads to ~3% cut in our core FY28E EBITDA; thus, a 3% fall in the stock price on 13th Jan’26 largely factors in such a deferral,” the brokerage said. Notably, the stock fell as much as 4.5 percent on November 13, before recovering some losses. JM Financial maintained its ‘Buy’ rating for the stock with a target price of Rs 4,500 per share, implying an upside potential of nearly 16 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. L&T share price: L&T shares fell 0.6 percent to trade at Rs 3,863.90 apiece, as seen at 1.20 pm. The stock has fallen around 7 percent in the past five days, and nearly 6 percent in the past one month. It however increased 11 percent in the past six months, and 12 percent in the past one year. The stock currently has a P/E ratio of 27.93, and a market capitalization of nearly Rs 5.32 lakh crore.

Real estate stocks fall for 7th straight day: Analysts say D-Street is factoring in a likely slump due to IT layoffs,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/real-estate-stocks-fall-for-7th-straight-day-analysts-say-d-street-is-factoring-in-a-slump-due-to-it-layoffs-13772416.html,"The shares of real estate companies dropped in trade on January 14, recording a decline for the seventh consecutive session. Analysts have collectively highlighted how sustained IT layoffs may continue to impact the sector, and what lies ahead. The sharp fall in the share prices pushed the Nifty Realty index down around 1.7 percent to hit a near nine-month low of 843.60 in the morning trading hours of Wednesday. The sectoral index fell a combined 8% in the last seven trading sessions. Top realty losers today: Signatureglobal (India) shares dropped over 2 percent, while Prestige Estates shares fell around 2 percent. Macrotech Developers (Lodha), Brigade Enterprises and Phoenix Mills shares fell more than 1 percent each on January 14. Anant Raj and Godrej Properties shares fell around 1 percent each, while Sobha shares were down in the red with marginal losses. Bucking the trend, Oberoi Realty and DLF shares were trading in the green with marginal gains. Are IT layoffs behind the downturn? Indian IT sector has seen mass layoffs last year, which have now spilled over to this year. In July last year, Moneycontrol exclusively reported that the IT behemoth Tata Consultancy Services will be letting go of 2 percent of its workforce, or roughly over 12,000 employees, over 2026, in a bid to become more agile and future-ready amid rapid disruptions in technology. India’s largest IT services company on January 12 said that it has released 6,000 employees in Q2, and around 1,800 employees in December quarter. HCLTech, which also released its Q3 results on January 12, reported a net reduction of 261 employees during the quarter, taking its total employee base to 2,26,379 at the end of the December. However, the company didn't mention how many of these employees voluntarily exited and how many were laid off. According to analysts, the IT layoffs have impacted housing demand in key areas, thereby impacting the stocks. IT layoffs are likely to be the major reason for the low demand in the luxury segment of urban centers like Bangalore and Hyderabad as they will be discouraging the high-income buyers, said Shashank Gupta, Director, RPS Group. He added that mid-to-premium housing sales, which have already dropped 15 percent year-on-year, will continue to be affected negatively as the professionals will not be willing to upgrade, opting instead to rent amid such job uncertainties. ""The market has whispered to the executives with Nifty Realty down by 20% from the peaks and talking about the disruption posed by the AI, which also indicates that 30% of the IT jobs that are luxury demand would get stifled due to the automation by 2027. The stock corrections that are expected to be around 5-7% are dependent on the RBI rate cuts and policy revamps that could fuel the market by the second quarter of 2026,"" the analyst said. Keshav Mangla, GM Business Development at Forteasia Realty, cited Anarock data to explain that financial tech layoffs of more than 1 lakh since 2024 have already resulted in a 12 percent drop in the demand for Tier-1 cities, thus resulting in developers' difficulties in managing cash flows and having to sell off their inventory. 'A double-edged sword for real estate stocks': ""The stock market does not seem to be giving enough attention to the AI threat; the tools for generative AI are expected to take away 20-25% of the coding jobs which can bring down the HNI investments that are responsible for 30% of luxury property launches,"" Mangla said. The continuous IT layoffs, which are expected to reach 2,00,000 by FY27, are a double-edged sword for real estate stocks which are currently at multi-month lows, said Anurag Goel, Director, Goel Ganga Developments. He explained that this was because the IT layoffs will cause a further reduction in purchasing power in the markets relying mostly on IT where 35 percent of home loans are taken out. What is in store for the future? ""The lowest ever prices for Brigade and Sobha indicate the investors' fears about the prolonged sales stagnation, as the number of launches in Q3 2025 has declined by 18%. The stock market is taking into account the AI risks only to a certain extent since companies like Infosys that are hyperscalers are moving towards automating and thus, displacing the mid-level talent and consequently, the demand for flats costing Rs 10 lakh-Rs 30 lakh is being affected,"" Goel said. ""A slight hopefulness,"" said Goel while speaking about what lies ahead. However, he expects the real estate stocks to decline by another 8 to 10 percent more in the absence of a stimulus. Is there a silver lining? While headlines around IT layoffs and AI-led efficiency gains have raised concerns, the market is already discounting a slowdown in incremental office demand rather than a collapse, said Harshal Dasani, Business Head, INVasset PMS. ""AI is more a productivity lever than a demand destroyer at this stage. It may change how space is used, but it does not eliminate the need for physical offices, especially in collaborative and client-facing roles,"" Dasani explained. He added that residential demand remains supported by stable employment outside pure tech, improving balance sheets, and low speculative supply. ""Near-term consolidation is possible, but structurally, the sector is adjusting—not breaking,"" the analyst said.

The sharp uptick in Transportation is a combination of ramp up in anchor account along with a spending recovery in strategic top accounts, ex-top 10 accounts declined 7.5% in USD. The OEMs’ participation is inclined towards costs savings instead of focusing on the innovation and growth areas. The M&C and H&L performance was discouraging and reported third consecutive quarters of decline. We believe the underlying spending pattern within M&C and H&L is sporadic, attributed to the structural issues, and would require couple of more quarters to achieve a steady state. The management was confident of reviving growth within these two verticals on the back of new logo additions and few closures that concluded in Q3. On margin, it exceeded our estimate by 140bps QoQ. At the current margin, the utilization stood at ~75%, it aspires to achieve 85% utilization with a combination of deploying automation and AI. Additionally, we believe the decoupling of revenue growth and talent hiring would provide incremental margins levers. We are revising our margins up by 70bps/40bps/20bps for FY26E/FY27E/FY28E due to beat in Q3. Outlook We expect CC revenue to decline by 4.8% (-5.1% QoQ earlier) in FY26E and grow by 9.8%/11.6% YoY in FY27E/FY28E. We are assigning 33x PE to FY28 EPS, translating a TP of 5,500.

Did Kotak Mahindra Bank stock really crash 80 percent today? Here’s why investors must not worry,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/did-kotak-mahindra-bank-stock-really-crash-80-percent-today-here-s-why-investors-must-not-worry-13772245.html,"Shares of Kotak Mahindra Bank appeared to plunge more than 80 percent on Wednesday, January 14. However, the dramatic fall is entirely optical and linked to the bank’s 5:1 stock split, which came into effect today. Kotak Mahindra Bank shares are trading ex-split today, with the face value reduced to Re 1 per share from Rs 5. As part of the corporate action, one existing equity share has been sub-divided into five equity shares, with the stock price adjusting proportionately. Why Kotak Mahindra Bank stock shows 80 percent fall, and where it really stands On platforms that do not automatically adjust historical prices for the split, the stock appears to be down nearly 80 percent. This is simply the mathematical adjustment from the pre-split price to the post-split price, not a sell-off. Once adjusted for the split, Kotak Mahindra Bank stock was trading around Rs 419-420, down about 1.6 percent on the day. On a split-adjusted basis, Kotak Mahindra Bank shares are trading comfortably within their recent range, with a 52-week low of about Rs 346 and a high near Rs 460. The bank’s market capitalisation, adjusted for the split, is around Rs 83,500 crore, and the stock is up over 9 percent over the past one year. What happens to investors’ shares in their demat accounts For shareholders, the split does not change the value of their investment. Instead, it changes the number of shares held and the price per share. If an investor held 1 share of Kotak Mahindra Bank before the split, that holding automatically becomes 5 shares in the demat account after the record date. Correspondingly, the share price adjusts to roughly one-fifth of the earlier level. The total investment value remains the same, barring normal market fluctuations. No action is required from investors. The additional shares are credited automatically to demat accounts, and the revised quantity becomes visible once the corporate action is fully processed by the depositories. The split is primarily aimed at improving liquidity and affordability, making the stock more accessible to a wider set of retail investors without altering fundamentals. Kotak Mahindra Bank’s stock split history This is not the first time the lender has split its shares: January 14, 2026: Face value reduced from Rs 5 to Re 1 (5:1 split)September 13, 2010: Face value reduced from Rs 10 to Rs 5 (2:1 split) In both instances, the objective was to enhance trading liquidity and broaden investor participation, without impacting the underlying valuation. Kotak Mahindra Bank stock call: ‘Buy’ Separately, brokerage commentary on Kotak Mahindra Bank shares continues to be driven by medium-term fundamentals rather than today’s corporate action. An HDFC Securities institutional research report this week maintained a constructive view on the lender’s stock. The report pointed to steady growth prospects, improving deposit quality, and resilient profitability, even as the bank navigates trade-offs between growth, margins, and asset quality. The brokerage reiterated a ‘Buy’ stance with a sum-of-the-parts target price of Rs 2,500 (pre-split), reflecting confidence in the franchise despite sector-wide challenges.

"Asian shares post small gain, Yen weakens past 159",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/asian-shares-post-small-gain-yen-weakens-past-159-13771713.html,"Asian shares posted a modest gain at the open, while Japanese equities extended their record-breaking run fueled by a weaker yen. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average advanced 0.9%, with the Japanese currency slipping past the 159-per-dollar level to the weakest since July 2024. Stocks in the country have jumped and the currency fallen amid reports of a snap election. Shares in South Korea edged up, having posted a gain on every trading day of 2026. In Tuesday’s US session, the S&P 500 fell from an all-time high, as JPMorgan Chase & Co. led a slide in lenders after its investment-banking fees missed guidance. US benchmarks dropped after December inflation data did little to dent expectations that the Federal Reserve will pause interest-rate cuts. Traders are going into Wednesday awaiting a possible US Supreme Court ruling on President Donald Trump’s global tariffs that were announced in April. Meanwhile, the cooler-than-expected US consumer price index reading reinforced bond traders’ expectations that the Fed will wait until mid-year to cut rates. Even after Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his board lowered the benchmark three times last year, money markets have continued to project the next reduction only in mid-2026. “The initial excitement sparked by a cooler-than-anticipated core CPI was short-lived,” said Jose Torres at Interactive Brokers. “The reversal was influenced, in part, by the report’s failure to pull forward the next expected rate reduction from June to April, as fixed-income watchers project Powell’s December cut will be his last at the helm.” Following JPMorgan’s results Tuesday, earnings from megabank rivals Bank of America Corp., Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley are slated for Wednesday and Thursday. The group is expected to post its second-highest annual profit ever, boosted by Trump’s policy changes. Traders also are mindful of the potential for a US Supreme Court ruling Wednesday on tariffs the White House has been enforcing. An adverse ruling could draw a negative market reaction, even as the administration has alternative legal avenues for most of the levies. Elsewhere, Brent crude notched its biggest four-day gain since June as Trump ramped up rhetoric on Iran, while silver also extended its recent rally to cap its best three-day streak on record. Attention in Asia will once again be on Japan, where Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s reported plan for a snap election fueled a rally in stocks while pushing down bonds and driving the yen deeper into the intervention-risk zone. Japanese five-year yields rose to 1.615%, the highest since the tenor’s 2000 debut. Success at the polls for Takaichi, who ascended to the premiership in October, would provide a mandate for her to continue hawkish diplomacy and pro-stimulus policies. Back to the US inflation data, the December core CPI, excluding the often volatile food and energy categories, increased 0.2% from November. On an annual basis, it advanced 2.6%, matching a four-year low. The reading is perhaps a more convincing sign that inflation is on a downward path, since a number of caveats in November’s report contributed to a significant pullback in the annual core CPI. “Given the quirks of November’s dual-month report, it’s surprising not to see more numerous large month-over-month readjustments,” said Stephen Kates at Bankrate. “Consumers can breathe a sigh of relief that we didn’t snap back to the 3% annual inflation rate. Although today’s reading doesn’t demonstrate additional progress for inflation, it doesn’t take a step backwards either.”","“The reversal was influenced, in part, by the report’s failure to pull forward the next expected rate reduction from June to April, as fixed-income watchers project Powell’s December cut will be his last at the helm.” Following JPMorgan’s results Tuesday, earnings from megabank rivals Bank of America Corp., Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley are slated for Wednesday and Thursday.","“The reversal was influenced, in part, by the report’s failure to pull forward the next expected rate reduction from June to April, as fixed-income watchers project Powell’s December cut will be his last at the helm.” Following JPMorgan’s results Tuesday, earnings from megabank rivals Bank of America Corp., Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley are slated for Wednesday and Thursday.",Traders are going into Wednesday awaiting a possible US Supreme Court ruling on President Donald Trump’s global tariffs that were announced in April.,"“The reversal was influenced, in part, by the report’s failure to pull forward the next expected rate reduction from June to April, as fixed-income watchers project Powell’s December cut will be his last at the helm.” Following JPMorgan’s results Tuesday, earnings from megabank rivals Bank of America Corp., Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley are slated for Wednesday and Thursday."
"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade TVS Motor, Union Bank of India, Dredging Corporation, Tech Mahindra, ICICI Bank, and others on January 14?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-tvs-motor-union-bank-of-india-dredging-corporation-tech-mahindra-icici-bank-and-others-on-january-14-13771690.html,"The benchmark indices gave up some of the previous day’s gains, with the Nifty 50 declining 0.22 percent on January 13. Market breadth was moderately weak, with about 1,491 shares declining against 1,370 advancing shares on the NSE. The market may see consolidation as long as it trades below the midline of the Bollinger Bands. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Amol Athawale, VP Technical Research at Kotak Securities TVS Motor Company | CMP: Rs 3,755.4 After declining from higher levels, TVS Motor rebounded from its retracement zone and witnessed a robust recovery. Additionally, on the intraday charts, the stock has given a breakout from its sloping trendline. The upward move in the stock suggests a new leg of a bullish trend from current levels. For the next few trading sessions, Rs 3,620 could be the trend-decider level for bulls. If the stock sustains above this level, a further uptrend towards Rs 4,010 can be expected. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 4,010 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,620 Jindal Steel | CMP: Rs 1,010.8 After a remarkable up move on the daily chart, Jindal Steel witnessed profit booking at higher levels. Following the recent sell-off, the downward momentum in the stock has stalled. Moreover, the stock has found support near its demand zone. This formation suggests a revival of the uptrend from current levels in the near future. For positional traders, Rs 980 would be the decisive level. If the stock trades above this level, the uptrend is likely to continue towards Rs 1,080. However, if it closes below Rs 980, traders may prefer to exit long positions. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,080 Stop-Loss: Rs 980 Union Bank of India | CMP: Rs 166.19 Following its strong up move and a brief consolidation over the last few sessions, Union Bank of India is gaining further traction for a fresh up move. The chart structure indicates a bullish continuation pattern, which is likely to persist in the near term. As long as the stock trades above Rs 161, the bullish bias is likely to continue, with an upside target of Rs 178. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 178 Stop-Loss: Rs 161 Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO at Waves Strategy Advisors Dredging Corporation of India | CMP: Rs 1,105 On the daily chart, Dredging Corporation of India has been trading in a broad consolidation range of Rs 892–1,071 over the past few weeks, indicating an accumulation phase. In the previous session, the stock finally gave a range breakout and managed to close above the range at Rs 1,105. This move was supported by a strong rise in volumes, adding credibility to the breakout. Additionally, the MACD has witnessed a bullish crossover for the first time since December 2025, which is a positive sign. For now, any dips towards Rs 1,070–1,075 can be considered a buying opportunity for an upside move towards Rs 1,150. On the downside, the Rs 1,020 level is expected to act as a crucial support. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,150 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,020 Tech Mahindra | CMP: 1,614.8 On the daily chart, Tech Mahindra has been moving within a larger triangle pattern since the beginning of December 2024 and is now trading close to the trendline resistance. At the start of this week, the stock found support at the 50-day EMA (Exponential Moving Average) and witnessed a sharp rebound, forming higher highs and higher lows, which signals an improving price structure. For now, a break above Rs 1,635 can confirm a breakout from the triangle pattern, potentially resulting in a fresh rally towards Rs 1,750–1,800, as long as the EMA support near Rs 1,558 remains protected on the downside. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,750, Rs 1,800 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,558 ICICI Bank | CMP: Rs 1,437 At the start of the month, ICICI Bank confirmed a breakout from a double-bottom pattern and has successfully retested the breakout zone. The stock is now trading near its prior swing high of Rs 1,442, indicating sustained strength. Over the past two sessions, prices have consistently protected the previous day’s low on a closing basis, which is a positive sign. Additionally, the Know Sure Thing (KST) indicator has already given a bullish crossover and is now trading above the zero line, suggesting that positive momentum is likely to continue. A decisive break above the Rs 1,442 level is required for bullish momentum to extend, which could push prices higher towards Rs 1,540, while Rs 1,390 is expected to act as the nearest support.

Zydus Lifesciences' unit Sentynl wins USFDA nod for rare pediatric disease therapy,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/zydus-lifesciences-unit-sentynl-wins-usfda-nod-for-rare-pediatric-menkes-disease-therapy-13771070.html,"Sentynl Therapeutics, a U.S.-based subsidiary of Zydus Lifesciences, has secured USFDA approval for ZYCUBO (copper histidinate), the first and only treatment for Menkes disease in the United States. The rare, fatal genetic disorder affects copper absorption and transport, leaving patients with severe neurological symptoms and a life expectancy of less than three years without treatment. The approval marks a milestone for Zydus Lifesciences, positioning the group in the rare disease space with a therapy that addresses a critical unmet need. “For the first time, patients have access to an approved therapy, offering hope where no options existed,” said Dr. Sharvil Patel, Managing Director of Zydus Lifesciences. ZYCUBO, a subcutaneous injectable formulation, restores copper homeostasis in pediatric patients. Clinical trials showed early treatment reduced the risk of death by nearly 80 percent compared to untreated controls, with median overall survival reaching 177 months versus 17.6 months for untreated patients. The USFDA granted ZYCUBO multiple designations, including breakthrough therapy, Fast Track, and Orphan Drug status. Sentynl acquired the asset from Cyprium Therapeutics in 2023 and advanced it through pivotal studies. The therapy also holds Orphan Designation in Europe. What is Menkes disease? Menkes disease, an X-linked recessive disorder caused by ATP7A gene mutations, has an estimated birth prevalence as high as 1 in 8,664 live male births. Untreated patients typically die by age three.

'President Trump doesn’t impact my investing cycle': Raamdeo Agrawal explains why,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/president-trump-doesn-t-impact-my-investing-cycle-raamdeo-agrawal-explains-why-13771306.html,"As Donald Trump's incessant tariff flipflops continue to impact markets globally, ace market expert and Motilal Oswal Group Chairman Raamdeo Agrawal said that the US President's decisions don't impact his investments. While speaking at CNBC TV18 Market Forum event ""The Alpha Generators for 2026"", Agrawal acknowledged that Trump's decisions do have an impact on the world because the world has become very interdependent due to the multi-lateral globalisation. ""On one side Trump is happening, and on the other side, AI is happening. I don't know how to figure out which one will impact how much. So, I am very happy that I am in India. I do things that I understand, and you need to have a view on four-five things and find ideas out of it,"" he said. Entrepreneurs or magicians? On being asked if such macro uncertainties can pose a threat to valuation, Agrawal said equity is a very ""exotic"" asset class. ""Equity has a huge power to take in a lot of uncertainty, and yet, there are few entrepreneurs who can act like a magician and navigate all kinds of risks. We have to find them, who can navigate such hard times and deliver earnings,"" the market analyst added. Agrawal further said that AI may have reduced the terminal value of Indian IT sector from what it was five year back. However, the analyst took the example of Yoga to explain the fast adoption of AI in India. “Yoga was discovered in India. However, people in US and other countries practice it more than us now. Similarly, AI was established in US or China, but we are the fastest and biggest adopter of AI,” he said, adding that Indian IT services companies will deliver the highest number of AI agents. How will markets perform in 2026? After nearly muted returns in 2025, the market expert expects 2026 to see better performance from the markets as the earnings cycle is turning after a brief lull over the past four-five quarters. He noted that the government is also trying its best to support the economy through various measures, including GST rationalization. Agrawal sees GDP recovery over the next 12 months, which in turn will boost earnings and subsequently markets. Which sectors will outperform? ""Large caps have better chances to perform well in the markets, than midcaps and smallcaps. PSUs still have lot of steam. They are much more reasonably valued than the private sector, and earnings growth is almost 2x higher than the private sector,"" the analyst said. He was also very optimistic about the auto sector, and said investors should buy auto ETFs. Also read: Will markets see a pre-Budget rally?

"Budget 2026: Will markets see a pre-Budget rally? Don't expect broad-based buying, say analysts",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/budget-2026-will-markets-see-pre-budget-rally-don-t-expect-broad-based-buying-say-analysts-13771172.html,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will be presenting Union Budget 2026 on February 1. Investors are looking forward to a rally ahead of the Budget presentation, though markets remain in red at present. Sensex dropped more than 250 points (0.3 percent) to close at 83,627.69 on January 13. Nifty 50 fell around 58 points (0.22 percent) to end the session at 25,732.30. How did markets react ahead of the previous Budget? Markets remained more or less flat with no major surprises ahead of Budget 2025. After closing 2024 at 23,644.80, Nifty 50 hit the month's high at 23,689.50 on January 9, 2025, marking only a marginal increase from December 31, 2024 closing level. Overall, the index ended January 2025 with slight losses before Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented Union Budget 2025 on February 1. Sensex too more or less mirrored Nifty’s performance during the month, falling 0.8 percent in January 2025 before the Budget presentation. ""Historical trends indicate that the Indian market typically underperforms in January preceding a budget, with the Nifty falling in four of the last five years due to profit-booking and policy uncertainty. Current indicators reinforce this cautious outlook,” said Santosh Meena, Head of Research at Swastika Investmart. Will markets rally ahead of Budget 2026? The pre-Budget periods are characterised by higher levels of market volatility and not the usual straight-line move to the higher side, as the market tries to price in its views on fiscal spending, said Siddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director, Vibhavangal Anukulakara. Swapnil Aggarwal, Director at VSRK Capital, also said that investors can expect some degree of pre-Budget positioning in the markets, though it is likely to be selective rather than a broad-based rally. However, Maurya said there could be bouts of buying in selected sectors, identified with the focus area of the Government, such as infrastructure, manufacturing, and consumption. He added that one cannot expect a broad-based move purely on expectation. ""The market shall have to await the Budget measures to ensure that concerns on growth are dealt with and fiscal discipline is seen,"" he concluded. Aggarwal meanwhile said that the sentiment typically improves on expectations of growth-supportive measures, especially around capital expenditure, infrastructure push, and incentives for emerging sectors as the Union Budget approaches. Cautious optimism: ""Recent market action suggests cautious optimism, with participants closely tracking macro signals, global cues, and fiscal discipline. While volatility may persist in the near term, incremental buying could emerge in pockets where policy continuity and earnings visibility are expected,"" the analyst said. That said, markets are unlikely to price in aggressive outcomes ahead of the Budget, and any upside may remain measured until there is clarity on actual announcements, Aggarwal said, adding that the near-term trend points towards consolidation with intermittent rallies, as investors balance Budget optimism with valuation concerns and global uncertainties. Which sectors will likely benefit? Ahead of the Union Budget 2026, the market focus is sharpening on sectors likely to benefit from a government push for economic growth, particularly through capital expenditure and rural revival, said Santosh Meena, Head of Research at Swastika Investmart. Infrastructire and defence: According to Meena, investors should look closely at infrastructure and defence, where expectations for sustained high allocation remain strong to support 'Make in India' initiatives. In the infrastructure space, companies like HG Infra Engineering and Larsen & Toubro (L&T) are top picks due to strong order books, while the defence sector offers opportunities in Bharat Electronics (BEL), Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL), and Mazagon Dock as they benefit from localization policies. Renewables and critical minerals: Additionally, renewables and critical minerals are gaining traction, with stocks like National Aluminium Company (NALCO), Tata Power and GMDC in focus due to the global shift toward green energy and energy security. Consumption and agriculture: The consumption and agriculture sectors are critical themes this year, driven by expectations of fiscal stimulus to address rural distress, Meena said. “The market anticipates measures such as enhanced subsidies or tax relief to boost disposable income, which would directly benefit the rural economy. Consequently, agricultural inputs are a key area to watch, with stocks like UPL, Dhanuka Agritech, Fertilisers And Chemicals Travancore (FACT) and Coromandel International positioned to gain from farm support schemes,” according to the analyst. This rural recovery narrative extends to broader consumption plays - FMCG giants like Hindustan Unilever (HUL) and ITC are defensive bets, while Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) serves as a strong proxy for both auto and rural demand. Banks: Financials, particularly State Bank of India (SBI) and HDFC Bank, remain foundational holdings to play the overall credit growth story, according to Meena. ""While a sharp, broad-based rally ahead of the Budget appears unlikely, selective upside cannot be ruled out in budget-sensitive sectors. Any pre-Budget rally is likely to be narrow, stock-specific and driven by expectations around capex, defence spending and rural support rather than a sustained market-wide move,"" the analyst concluded. Investors may thus see pockets of rally, particularly in sectors linked to capital expenditure, infrastructure, manufacturing, defence, and rural consumption, as traders position themselves ahead of favourable policy cues, said Karthik Narayan, Vice President – Title, Tax & Transition, Stellar Innovations. However, a broad-based and sustained rally will depend upon how far the Budget can balance growth stimulus with fiscal discipline, the analyst said. What should investors do? Narender Agarwal, Founder & CEO at Wealth1, also noted that any rally ahead of the Budget is likely to be measured rather than euphoric, and investors should avoid aggressive positioning purely on expectations, focusing instead on fundamentally strong businesses. “For investors, the Budget should be seen as an opportunity to align portfolios with India’s long-term growth themes rather than focus solely on short-term volatility. A growth-oriented Budget, backed by strong economic momentum, can support broader market participation and set the stage for sustained returns beyond the Budget event,” said Tushar Badjate, Director of Badjate Stock & Shares.","Infrastructire and defence: According to Meena, investors should look closely at infrastructure and defence, where expectations for sustained high allocation remain strong to support 'Make in India' initiatives.","Ahead of the Union Budget 2026, the market focus is sharpening on sectors likely to benefit from a government push for economic growth, particularly through capital expenditure and rural revival, said Santosh Meena, Head of Research at Swastika Investmart.","Swapnil Aggarwal, Director at VSRK Capital, also said that investors can expect some degree of pre-Budget positioning in the markets, though it is likely to be selective rather than a broad-based rally.","That said, markets are unlikely to price in aggressive outcomes ahead of the Budget, and any upside may remain measured until there is clarity on actual announcements, Aggarwal said, adding that the near-term trend points towards consolidation with intermittent rallies, as investors balance Budget optimism with valuation concerns and global uncertainties."

Amid positive global cues, domestic indices opened on a strong note, extending the previous session’s sharp recovery. However, the benchmarks failed to sustain early gains and remained largely rangebound through the day, eventually closing with modest losses. At close, the Sensex was down 250.48 points or 0.30 percent at 83,627.69, and the Nifty was down 57.95 points or 0.22 percent at 25,732.30. Mixed performance was seen among the broader indices, with the BSE Midcap index declining 0.2 percent, while the Smallcap index rose 0.5 percent.

Click to View More Outlook for January 14 Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets remained volatile on the weekly expiry day and ended marginally lower amid mixed cues. After an initial uptick, the Nifty 50 drifted lower for most of the session, though a rebound in the final hour trimmed some losses and helped it settle at 25,732.30. Sectoral trends were mixed, keeping participants engaged, with IT and metal stocks among the gainers, while realty and pharma remained subdued and closed in the red. The midcap and smallcap segments witnessed selective participation, with smallcaps showing modest resilience even as overall market breadth stayed moderate. Market action reflects the interplay between earnings-related reactions and global uncertainty. Early optimism was supported by encouraging IT earnings and signs of progress in India–U.S. trade discussions, which lifted sentiment in the first half. However, the lack of follow-through and fresh selling in heavyweights across sectors capped the upside. Ongoing geopolitical and global trade concerns also continued to weigh on risk appetite, keeping trading largely stock-specific. We maintain a cautious view on the Nifty and suggest continuing with a sell-on-rise approach until the index decisively reclaims the 26,000 level. A decisive breach of medium-term 100-day EMA, placed near 25,600, could accelerate the decline toward the 25,400 zone. Given the earnings season and fluctuating global cues, it is prudent to stay light and wait for clearer confirmation of the next directional move. Participants should focus on stock-specific opportunities and prefer a hedged approach amid the prevailing choppiness. Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities After witnessing an excellent upside recovery from the lows on Monday, Nifty slipped into weakness from the highs on Tuesday and closed the day's lower amidst recovery note. After opening on an upside gap, Nifty failed to sustain the highs and slipped into weakness in the early-mid part of the session. Smart recovery has emerged from near the lows of 25600 and Nifty finally closed off the lows. The opening upside gap has been filled completely. A long bear candle was formed on the daily chart with long lower shadow. Technically, this market action indicates presence of crucial overhead resistance around 25900-26000 levels. But the buying has started to emerge from near the lower supports. This is positive signal and hints at the possibility of eventual breakout in the short term. The underlying short-term trend of Nifty remains positive. The formation of higher bottom reversal pattern on intraday chart (60 min) indicates that the market could move up from here and surpass the hurdle of 25900-26000 levels in the next few sessions. Immediate support is placed at 25600 levels. Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

This comes after Union Labour Minister Mansukh Mandaviya held meetings over the past month with major quick commerce and delivery platforms, including Blinkit, Zepto, Zomato and Swiggy, to discontinue the marketing and branding of 10-minute delivery services. Other quick commerce platforms, such as Swiggy and Zepto, may also follow suit after the intervention by the Union Ministry of Labour, which was concerned about the welfare of the delivery workers trying to meet such tight deadlines.

The shares of the company rose to Rs 232.55 apiece, snapping a four-session losing streak. JM Financial on Ixigo: JM Financial noted that Ixigo shares have corrected approximately 20 percent since the end of November 2025 due to expectation of relatively slower growth in the flights business in Q3 and Q4 FY26 after recent disruptions in the industry and an unfavourable base (Kumbh Mela benefit last year), and uncertainty around margin due to ramp-up in its tech, supply-side and promotional investments towards hotels’ OTA. However, the domestic brokerage believes that the current phase represents a temporary earnings and sentiment overhang, which shall ease over the next few quarters. “From a medium-to-long-term perspective, Ixigo remains well positioned to grow faster than peers owing to its effective cross-sell of services across various apps, sharp focus on superior customer experience and robust traction for its differentiated value-added services,” it added.

It said expectations of immediate margin improvement following the merger -- despite refinancing wholesale bonds with deposits -- have been misplaced, and that FY27 is more likely to mark a ‘bounce-back’ year for the bank. The brokerage also highlighted valuation comfort, noting that after the recent correction, HDFC Bank is trading at a 10-12 percent price-to-book discount to ICICI Bank, and said it is an opportunity for investors to look past near-term noise and focus on the franchise’s longer-term strengths. HDFC Bank, India’s largest private sector lender by market capitalisation at about Rs 14.4 lakh crore, is currently valued at around 19.9 times earnings, with a dividend yield of roughly 1.18 percent.

Will Trump's 25% tariff on countries doing business with Iran be a negative for Indian markets? Here's what analysts say,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/will-trump-s-25-tariff-on-countries-doing-business-with-iran-be-a-negative-for-indian-markets-here-s-what-analysts-say-13770512.html,"US President Donald Trump has announced that any country engaging in business with Iran will face 25 percent tariff on any trade with US. Analysts have suggested what this can mean for Indian stock markets. Indian benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty have seen some pressure last year amid Trump’s tariff flipflops. The almost muted annual returns in 2025 came as Trump increased tariffs on Indian exports to US to 50 percent, citing New Delhi’s continued purchase of Russian oil. Amid Iran's biggest anti-government protests in years, Trump took to Truth Social to announce his new round of tariffs. ""Effective immediately, any Country doing business with the Islamic Republic of Iran will pay a Tariff of 25% on any and all business being done with the United States of America,"" he wrote. ""This Order is final and conclusive,"" Trump said without providing any further detail. No official documentation from the White House on the new round of tariffs has yet been released. Iran, a member of the OPEC oil producing group, has been heavily sanctioned by Washington for years. It exports much of its oil to China, with Turkey, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates and India among its other top trading partners. Sensex dropped more than 545 points (0.65 percent) to 83,328, while Nifty 50 fell 157 points (0.61 percent) to 25,632.90, as seen at 1 pm on Tuesday. Fresh pressure on India? Trump’s decision to impose a 25 percent tariff on countries trading with Iran adds fresh pressure on India, which is already facing tariffs of up to 50 percent on several exports to the US. Together, this creates a potential tariff burden of as much as 75 percent on certain Indian goods. India–Iran trade stood at $1.68 billion in FY25, and mainly comprised exports of rice, food products, medicines, tea, and spices to Iran, while imports include chemicals and dry fruits, said Abhinav Tiwari, Research Analyst at Bonanza. He noted that while the trade size is modest, the concern is that the US tariff applies broadly to countries doing business with Iran, not just to Iran related goods. “A key strategic risk is the Chabahar Port project in Iran, which is vital for India’s access to Central Asia. While the project currently has a US sanctions waiver valid until April 2026, there is uncertainty over whether it will remain protected,” the analyst further said. 'A key macro overhang for Indian markets, but...' The renewed threat of a 25 percent tariff by former US President Donald Trump has resurfaced as a key macro overhang for Indian markets, but its actual economic impact needs to be viewed with perspective rather than panic, said Harshal Dasani, Business Head at INVasset PMS. He noted that while headlines suggest a broad-based disruption, India's direct export exposure to the US remains concentrated in select segments such as textiles, gems and jewellery, leather goods and certain engineering products. Impact on Rupee? A potential 25 percent tariff threat on exports to the US is already being felt as it adds to trade tensions, which affect rupee weakness, especially in sectors that are more sensitive to exports, said Siddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director at Vibhavangal Anukulakara. “Although the Indian economy is more domestically oriented, stock markets related to exports can suffer short-term turbulence in stock markets due to the potential growth impact from tariffs. Investors will watch to what level of diversification can happen to avoid the negative impact due to tariffs,” he said. “For markets, the immediate reaction has been driven more by sentiment than fundamentals. Export-linked stocks may witness near-term volatility, but India’s broader market construct today is far more domestically anchored than in previous tariff cycles. Consumption, financials, infrastructure and services continue to be driven by internal demand rather than US trade flows,” Dasani said, adding that this phase will let investors distinguish headline risk from earnings reality. In the near term, the impact should be manageable due to low Iran trade exposure and ongoing India–US negotiations, and over the medium term, a negotiated settlement remains the most likely outcome, which would limit market damage and reduce long term risks, said Tiwari from Bonanza.

"Jefferies says new labour codes may add to margin pressures for IT companies, sees lower wage hikes at senior level",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/jefferies-says-new-labour-codes-may-add-to-margin-pressures-for-it-companies-sees-lower-wage-hikes-at-senior-level-13770233.html,"Global brokerage firm Jefferies on Monday said India’s new labour codes are likely to add to margin pressures for information technology (IT) firms and could lead to lower wage hikes, particularly at the senior level. The labour codes, which came into effect in November, mandate that employee wages must be at least 50 percent of cost to company (CTC), with benefits such as provident fund and gratuity to be calculated on wages. This is expected to raise recurring employee costs for IT companies and also result in a large one-time financial impact. ""New labour codes will add to the margin pressures from slower revenue growth, AI-led business mix change and potentially higher onsite wage hikes in FY27 and FY28 due to changes in H-1B visa norms,"" Jefferies said in a note. It added that a 2 percent increase in Indian employee costs could reduce FY27 earnings estimates by 2-4 percent for IT companies. Firms are likely to offset part of the impact through lower wage hikes, especially at senior levels. IT services firm HCLTech reported an 11.2 percent decline in consolidated net profit to Rs 4,076 crore for the October-December quarter of FY26, mainly due to a one-time provision of Rs 719 crore linked to the implementation of the new labour codes. The Noida-based company had posted a net profit of Rs 4,591 crore in the same quarter last year. Excluding the one-time impact, HCLTech said net profit would have stood at Rs 4,795 crore. Regulatory filings showed that the impact on earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) was Rs 956 crore. HCLTech said the one-time impact under the labour code amounted to about Rs 900 crore, and that this would not affect its hiring plans. Chief People Officer Ram Sundararajan said the company has factored in all required provisions in the current quarter’s pay changes and does not expect any further significant incremental costs related to the new rules. Country’s largest IT services exporter Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) also reported a 13.91 percent decline in profit for the December quarter at Rs 10,657 crore, largely due to the one-time impact of the labour codes. The company said the implementation of the new labour codes during the quarter led to a statutory impact of Rs 2,128 crore. Excluding this, profit would have grown 8.5 percent to Rs 13,438 crore.

"Auto stocks decline for fifth straight session: Analysts say overall outlook is positive, cite multiple tailwinds",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/auto-stocks-decline-for-fifth-straight-session-analysts-say-overall-outlook-is-positive-cite-multiple-tailwinds-13770407.html,"The shares of automakers and auto-parts makers dropped in trade on January 13, extending losses for the fifth consecutive session. Analysts have however expressed optimism, and what investment strategy investors should take after the consolidation. The fall in the share prices pushed the Nifty Auto index down around 0.7 percent to 27,817, as seen at 12.15 pm on Tuesday. The index has fallen more than 3 percent in the past five days. Top auto losers today: Tube Investments of India shares were the top loser on the index, falling around 2 percent to trade at Rs 2,367 apiece. Exide Industries, Uno Minda, Maruti Suzuki, Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) and TVS Motor Company shares meanwhile fell more than 1 percent each. Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles and Hero MotoCorp shares fell nearly 1 percent each, while Ashok Leyland and Eicher Motors shares were trading in the red with marginal losses. Bucking the trend, Sona BLW Precision Forgings, Bosch, Bajaj Auto, Bharat Forge and Samvardhana Motherson International shares were trading in the green with marginal gains. Here's what analysts say: The recent fall in the auto stocks reflects near-term profit booking and demand concerns, rather than a structural breakdown of the sector, said Siddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director at Vibhavangal Anukulakara. Harshal Dasani, Business Head at INVasset PMS, also said that the recent correction in Nifty Auto should be viewed more as a phase of consolidation than a breakdown in the sector’s fundamentals. ""Auto stocks have delivered strong returns over the last year, and some near-term profit booking was inevitable, especially amid broader market volatility. Importantly, the medium-term outlook for the auto sector remains constructive, supported by multiple policy and demand tailwinds,"" he said. From the March 2025 low of 19,300, the Nifty Auto index has rallied nearly 40 percent to 27,555, indicating that a lot of optimism is already priced in, said Tushar Badjate, Director of Badjate Stock & Shares. He noted that the recent correction reflects valuation rationalisation rather than demand stress. What lies ahead? Going forward, a rebound in demand indicators, stability in macros, and clarity in policies might help the auto names stabilize, Maurya said. However, he cautioned that till the time clear triggers on consumer demand or sector-specific catalysts emerge, volatility and range-bound action are likely to persist in the near term. Dasani noted that the potential GST rationalisation on automobiles, expectations of interest rate cuts, and income tax relief aimed at boosting disposable income can meaningfully support vehicle demand across segments. Lower financing costs tend to have a direct and visible impact on auto sales, particularly in passenger vehicles and two-wheelers. In addition, government focus on manufacturing, EV adoption, and infrastructure continues to support long-term volume growth, the analyst said. Will Trump's 500% tariff threat impact auto stocks? Concerns around the proposed 500 percent US tariff should not materially alter the outlook for Indian auto manufacturers, as India’s direct auto exports to the US are limited, Dasani highlighted. The impact, if any, is more likely to be felt by select auto ancillary players supplying components to global OEMs, rather than domestic auto makers themselves. Is this correction a buying opportunity? ""Overall, the recent correction offers an opportunity to recalibrate positions in a sector where structural drivers remain firmly intact and visibility on demand recovery continues to improve,"" Dasani concluded. Badjate said that going ahead, growth is likely to be more selective—led by OEMs with strong product pipelines, export visibility and rising EV penetration, which is gradually emerging as a structural growth driver for the sector. ""While near-term volatility may persist amid the ongoing Q3 earnings season, the broader structural outlook for the sector remains intact. The current correction could offer a buying opportunity for long-term investors, supported by healthy fundamentals and the Government’s continued focus on incentives for electric vehicles and hybrid mobility. Investors should maintain a selective approach, with a preference for sector leaders that have strong EV exposure,"" said Vishnu Kant Upadhyay, AVP -Research & Advisory at Master Capital Services. Ajit Mishra, SVP of Research at Religare Broking, said that with the earnings season underway, volatility is likely to persist, driven by stock-specific results. ""While most stocks in the sector are participating in the move, Bajaj Auto, Eicher Motors, TVS Motor, M&M, and Maruti are displaying relative strength and can be considered for accumulation on declines,"" he said.

The recovery in the IT majors' shares also followed a reversal in broader markets, with BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty erasing morning losses to edge into the green. TCS stock was trading at Rs 3,258.1 around noon, up 0.6 percent, reversing losses seen in early trade amid concerns around limited growth visibility.

The intraday rebound in both stocks points to stabilising sentiment after initial post-results selling. In both cases, analysts broadly acknowledged steady execution, healthy deal pipelines, and resilient margins. However, enthusiasm remained tempered by broader concerns around growth sustainability and near-term earnings momentum. Also read | HCL Tech Q3 results review: Fundamentals improve, but brokerages cautious on near-term stock outlook For TCS, brokerages highlighted muted international business trends, modest forward indicators, and limited clarity on a sharp growth acceleration, keeping most houses in neutral or cautious territory despite operational stability.

"Capital One, Amex shares sink on Trump's credit-card threat",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/capital-one-amex-shares-sink-on-trump-s-credit-card-threat-13770303.html,"Shares of Capital One Financial Corp., American Express Co. and other US banks sank after President Donald Trump called on credit-card companies to cap interest rates at 10% for a year, a move that could wipe out billions in profits for one of the banking industry’s biggest businesses. Capital One, the largest US card issuer, tumbled 6.4% in New York, the biggest decline in nine months, after the president surprised the industry with a move he said could go into effect next week. American Express dropped 4.3% and JPMorgan Chase & Co., No. 2 in the card rankings, slid 1.4%. Card interest rates, which have been hovering above 20% in recent years, have been a target of US lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, with bills popping up proposing similar caps and meeting stiff resistance from the industry. Trump, speaking Sunday to reporters, set a Jan. 20 deadline for companies to comply or risk being “in violation of the law.” The cap proposed by the president “could wipe out earnings from cards for a year,” Mike Mayo, an analyst at Wells Fargo & Co., said in a note. The idea “would ruin card economics (eliminate most of card earnings today) and incentives would be to stop lending,” Mayo said. Citigroup Inc. dropped 3%, while Wells Fargo slipped 1% and Synchrony Financial lost 8.4% on Monday. Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. also fell. While those companies aren’t issuers of credit cards, they rely on fees generated when consumers use their products. Despite the political appeal of Trump’s proposal, several analysts questioned whether approval of a rate cap was likely, given the strength of the banking industry’s pull in Congress and limited legislative momentum. “Given how severe it is, it is hard to imagine it moving forward,” Brian Foran, an analyst at Truist Financial Corp., wrote in a note. In response to Trump’s call, industry groups including the Bank Policy Institute and Consumer Bankers Association struck a measured tone. “We share the president’s goal of helping Americans access more affordable credit,” the groups said in a joint statement late Friday. “At the same time, evidence shows that a 10% interest rate cap would reduce credit availability and be devastating for millions of American families and small-business owners who rely on and value their credit cards, the very consumers this proposal intends to help.” Should the idea take effect, fallout would probably affect lower-income consumers the most as banks restrict their access to loans, according to several analysts. “As credit availability is curtailed, consumers will have to rely on alternate sources of consumer lending,” KBW Inc. analyst Sanjay Sakhrani wrote in a note, adding that those alternatives are “significantly more expensive” for borrowers. Barclays Plc, the British lender that relies on credit cards as a key part of its US consumer banking business, slumped 2.4% in London, the firm’s biggest loss since Nov. 18. What Bloomberg Intelligence Says: Any US cap or restriction on credit card rates would hit Barclays hardest among European banks. The lender’s US consumer bank is expected to generate £3.6 billion revenue in 2025 (12% of group total), but 5% of pretax profit, with credit cards a key element. Though President Donald Trump’s demand that credit card interest rates are capped at 10% might not be enforced in full given the strength of US bank lobby groups. — Phil Richards, BI banking analyst There could be a few winners as well. Wells Fargo’s Mayo said that if general availability of traditional credit card loans is reduced due to rate caps, the attractiveness of buy-now, pay-later firms such as Klarna Group Plc and Affirm Holdings Inc. could increase. Shares of Klarna fell 2.7% and Affirm lost 6.6%. Airlines, which generate substantial profits from credit-card partnerships, also took a hit on Monday. Delta Air Lines Inc. shares fell 1.8%, United Airlines Holdings Inc. dropped 1.7% and Southwest Airlines Co. slipped 1.5%. Retailers with substantive credit-card portfolios also took a hit. Macy’s Inc. fell 5.4% on Monday and Kohl’s Corp. shares were down 3.9%.

The VSF business is entering a margin recovery phase in 2HFY26, supported by a modest rebound in China pricing, stable pulp costs, and consistently high utilization levels (>90%). These should drive an expansion in EBITDA/kg and margins over FY27–28E. In chemicals, GRASIM’s leadership in chlor-alkali and epoxy resins, coupled with ongoing investments to raise chlorine integration to ~70%, underpins steady revenue and EBITDA growth despite a correction in caustic soda price due to overcapacity. Outlook The paints business (Birla Opus), while currently in an investment-led phase, provides a scalable growth optionality in a large and under-penetrated market, with rapid distribution expansion and brand investments positioning the business for medium-term operating leverage once scale is achieved.

Services business performance was also strong (+1.8% QoQ CC) defying the furloughs and holidays impact. The service business growth was majorly led by ER&D segment that reported another quarter of strong growth (+3.1% QoQ CC vs 2.2% QoQ CC LQ). The service-led growth was largely aided by extop 20 accounts (+2.3% QoQ), which implies the decision making and execution cycle remains strong at the lower-end of the pyramid. Again, the advanced AI revenue growth (19.9% QoQ CC) is largely a component of short-burst deals that further validates the velocity of smaller deal remains strong. The new deal TCV reported at USD3.0b, which includes one of the mega deals (USD473m) of five-year strategic engagement. We believe the service-led growth should continue its momentum in FY27/FY28 on the back of strong order wins and growing AI revenue stream. Hence, we are revising the topline CC growth upward by 30bps/20bps to 7.0% and 7.7% for FY27E/FY28E.

HCL Tech stock was trading 2.37 percent lower at Rs 1,628 around 10 am, hovering near the day’s low, underperforming a firmer broader market. The stock has now given up its pre-results gains and remains over 16 percent lower over the past year. That was also a key factor tempering sentiment even after a strong operational quarter. Broader market sentiment was positive, with benchmark indices NSE Nifty and BSE Sensex seeing moderate gains. Brokerages broadly acknowledged HCL Tech’s strong Q3 delivery, marked by robust deal wins, stable margins, and a guidance upgrade that places the company at the top end of the peer growth range. However, most analysts stopped short of turning bullish on the stock, flagging seasonality risks, valuation comfort, and historical return patterns as constraints on near-term performance. Citi maintained a Neutral rating with a target price of Rs 1,700, noting that while HCL Tech’s forward indicators and deal pipeline are stronger than peers, the current valuation leaves little room for sharp upside. HSBC and CLSA reiterated Hold calls, with CLSA highlighting that Q4 growth could turn sequentially negative due to seasonal weakness in the products business, a phase during which the stock has historically underperformed. Among the brokerages, Nomura stood out with a Buy rating and a target of Rs 1,810, citing confidence in HCL Tech’s AI-led, services-driven growth strategy and expectations of margin normalisation in FY27.

TCS shares slip in early trade as cautious brokerage views weigh after Q3 results,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/tcs-shares-slip-in-early-trade-as-cautious-brokerage-views-weigh-after-q3-results-13769817.html,"Shares of Tata Consultancy Services edged lower in early trade on Tuesday, as investors weighed the company’s Q3 FY26 results against a largely cautious brokerage outlook that flagged limited visibility on a sustained growth recovery. TCS stock slipped to Rs 3,220.4 in the opening minutes, down 0.6 percent, reversing part of the 1.1 percent rise in the previous session ahead of the earnings announcement. Broader market sentiment was marginally positive, with benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty trading slightly higher in early deals. The early weakness reflects subdued investor sentiment following the results, despite analysts broadly agreeing that TCS delivered an in-line operational quarter excluding exceptional items and maintained stable margins. However, the absence of a clear acceleration in demand has kept expectations in check, particularly for the company’s international business, which remains a key driver of overall growth. Most brokerages stopped short of turning positive on the stock, citing muted international growth trends, modest deal momentum, and limited evidence of growth leadership returning in the near term. Forward indicators such as deal conversion and headcount trends were also seen as offering little immediate comfort. Several brokerages retained ‘neutral’ or ‘hold’ ratings, signalling a cautious stance on near-term prospects. Citi remained bearish on the stock, while CLSA stood out as the only brokerage with a clearly constructive view, pointing to stable margins, a sharp rise in AI-led revenue, and management’s confidence in stronger growth in CY26. TCS had reported a 14 percent year-on-year decline in reported Q3 net profit, largely due to hefty exceptional charges linked to restructuring, statutory impacts, and a legal provision. Excluding these one-offs, profit rose 8.5 percent, highlighting operational stability. The company also announced a Rs 57 per share dividend, including a special payout. With the stock now down over 24 percent over the past year, investors remain focused on whether demand momentum and deal activity can improve meaningfully in the coming quarters to support a sustained re-rating.

"HCL Tech Q3 results review: Fundamentals improve, but brokerages cautious on near-term stock outlook",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/hcl-tech-q3-results-review-fundamentals-improve-but-brokerages-cautious-on-near-term-stock-outlook-13769773.html,"HCL Technologies’ Q3 FY26 results have strengthened confidence in its operational momentum and deal pipeline, but brokerages are not uniformly bullish on the stock, signalling only a limited near-term upside despite improved earnings visibility. Shares of HCL Tech closed marginally higher at Rs 1,667 on Monday, up 0.34 percent, ahead of the results. The stock remains down over 16 percent over the past year, underperforming the broader market. That is also a key reason brokerages are tempering enthusiasm even after a strong quarter. Brokerage commentary broadly agreed that the business is executing well, but valuations and seasonal risks cap upside, advising against aggressive buying at current levels. What worked: Deal wins, guidance upgrade, margins HCL Tech delivered a strong operational quarter, marked by a 43 percent year-on-year jump in trailing twelve-month deal TCV, improved margins, and a guidance upgrade. Services revenue growth guidance for FY26 was raised to 4.75-5.25 percent in constant currency, placing HCL Tech at the upper end of the peer group. Citi issued a Neutral rating with a target price of Rs 1,700, noting that HCL Tech’s forward indicators are better than peers, aided by rising headcount and management focus on identifying new spend areas. Citi also raised FY27-FY28 earnings estimates by 2 percent. HSBC gave a Hold call with a target of Rs 1,815, highlighting that HCL Tech has sustained Q2 momentum into Q3 and now sits at the top end of the peer growth range. HSBC sees operating margins trending towards 18-19 percent in FY27, with a 5-6 percent medium-term revenue CAGR appearing achievable. Why caution persists despite a strong quarter Despite the upbeat fundamentals, brokerages remain wary of near-term performance of HCL Tech shares, citing seasonality, valuation comfort, and historical return patterns. CLSA kept a Hold rating with a target of Rs 1,661, pointing out that even at the upper end of guidance, Q4 implies negative sequential growth in constant currency, largely due to seasonal weakness in the products business. CLSA also flagged that historically, HCL Tech stock has delivered weak returns between Q4 and Q2, compared with strong gains in the Q2-Q3 period. The bullish pocket: AI-led services strategy The one clear positive differentiator is HCL Tech’s AI-focused, services-led growth strategy, which is gaining traction. Nomura stood out with a Buy rating and a target price of Rs 1,810, implying an upside of nearly 9 percent. It cited a clear earnings beat, guidance lift, and margin resilience. Nomura views the company’s asset-light, services-centric AI push as structurally positive, while expecting margins to normalise favourably in FY27.

TCS stock outlook cautious after Q3 results; brokerages flag weak growth visibility,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/tcs-stock-outlook-cautious-after-q3-results-brokerages-flag-weak-growth-visibility-13769723.html,"The outlook for Tata Consultancy Services stock has turned cautious to mixed following its Q3 FY26 results. Most brokerages stopped short of a bullish stance and flagged limited growth visibility, muted international momentum, and constrained margin upside despite an in-line operational quarter. TCS shares had risen a firm 1.1 percent on Monday to close at Rs 3,243 on the NSE ahead of the earnings announcement. Even so, the stock remains down more than 24 percent over the past year, with investors watching whether growth momentum can revive in CY26. Citi struck a bearish note with a ‘Sell’ call on TCS stock and a target price of Rs 3,020 per share. While it acknowledged that Q3 performance was in line excluding exceptional items, Citi flagged weak forward indicators -- that includes just a 1.5 percent year-on-year growth in trailing twelve-month total contract value, and a 4 percent YoY decline in headcount. The brokerage warned that muted international business growth could disappoint. It noted that nearly half of the quarter-on-quarter revenue growth was driven by equipment and software, rather than core services. Nomura maintained a ‘Neutral’ rating with a target price of Rs 3,300, describing the quarter as a modest beat on revenue and margins. However, it said visibility on TCS’ growth leadership remains limited. While management expects CY26 to outperform CY25, Nomura cautioned that meaningful margin expansion in FY27 appears unlikely without a stronger and broader-based growth recovery. HSBC also remained cautious, retaining a ‘Hold’ rating and a target price of Rs 3,450. The brokerage said Q3 reflected a largely status quo quarter, with no material change in growth trends. While margins were solid and demand commentary was positive, HSBC said the stock’s risk-reward appears balanced at current levels. CLSA offered a clearly positive stance, with an ‘Outperform’ call and a target price of Rs 3,593, implying an upside of about 11 percent on TCS share price. CLSA highlighted TCS’ 0.8 percent constant-currency sequential revenue growth in Q3 FY26 and management’s confidence in stronger CY26 growth. It also pointed to the sharp rise in annualised AI revenue to $1.8 billion, up 17.3 percent quarter-on-quarter, as a key positive. However, it noted that the order book declined 7 percent sequentially to $9.3 billion. EBIT margin stood at 25.2 percent, up 70 basis points year-on-year despite wage hikes. TCS had reported a 14 percent year-on-year fall in reported Q3 net profit due to large exceptional charges, even as profit excluding one-offs rose 8.5 percent. The company also announced a Rs 57 per share dividend, including a special payout.

"MidCap, SmallCap inflows in 2025 hit record high despite scheme delivers muted returns",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/mutual-funds/midcap-smallcap-inflows-in-2025-hit-record-high-despite-scheme-delivers-muted-returns-13769363.html,"Inflows into mid-cap and small-cap mutual fund schemes touched record levels in 2025 despite sharp volatility in broader markets, the absence of foreign investors from these segments, stretched valuations, and muted earnings. AMFI data showed that mid-cap schemes received Rs 49,939 crore during the year, up 46 percent from a year earlier, while small-cap schemes attracted Rs 52,321 crore, an increase of 53 percent. Market performance remained mixed during the period. The BSE MidCap index rose 1.1 percent in 2025, while the BSE SmallCap index declined 6.6 percent. In comparison, the Sensex and Nifty gained nearly 9 percent and 10.5 percent, respectively. Axis Securities’ Rajesh Palviya said the inflows were supported by steady SIP investments and investors continuing to add to their mutual fund holdings, based on the strong three-year and five-year outperformance of mid-cap and small-cap stocks over large-cap shares. Market breadth stayed weak. Of the 140 stocks in the BSE MidCap index, 86 ended the year with negative returns, while in the BSE SmallCap index, 871 of the 1,186 stocks were in the red. In the BSE100 index, 61 stocks posted gains and 39 recorded losses. Palviya said investors have been using market declines to average their investments, as SIP inflows into mid-cap and small-cap schemes continue on a regular basis. Domestic investors have been the main source of net inflows over the past two years and have preferred mid-cap and small-cap schemes over large-cap funds. Foreign investors have largely stayed away from these segments and have mainly been selling large-cap stocks, which has further concentrated domestic flows into mid-cap and small-cap schemes. The share of mid-cap and small-cap schemes in total equity inflows also increased during the year. Mid-cap funds accounted for a record 14.26 percent of total equity inflows, up from 8.7 percent in 2024 and 14.18 percent in 2023. Small-cap funds also saw their share rise to a two-year high of 14.26 percent, compared with 8.68 percent in 2024 and 25.4 percent in 2023. Total equity inflows for the year stood at Rs 3.51 lakh crore, down 11.19 percent from Rs 3.94 lakh crore in 2024 and Rs 1.62 lakh crore in 2023. Analysts said the absence of outflows despite nearly 16 months of muted returns indicates continued investor commitment. They said many investors remain focused on a three- to four-year horizon, even as near-term returns have been weak, while investment in assets such as gold and silver at current elevated prices is harder to justify for long-term allocations. Independent research analyst Ambreesh Baliga said inflows into mutual funds are likely to continue going ahead as mid-cap and small-cap funds have delivered better results than individual portfolios. While many individual portfolios are down 20 percent to 30 percent or more, he said even the worst-performing mid-cap and small-cap funds were down only about 5 percent to 6 percent as of the end of December. Baliga said investor interest remains as long as losses are limited. He added that when losses become large, investors stop averaging, liquidity in the secondary market declines, selling pressure rises, and stocks can fall further, sometimes leading to margin calls.","While many individual portfolios are down 20 percent to 30 percent or more, he said even the worst-performing mid-cap and small-cap funds were down only about 5 percent to 6 percent as of the end of December.","Of the 140 stocks in the BSE MidCap index, 86 ended the year with negative returns, while in the BSE SmallCap index, 871 of the 1,186 stocks were in the red.","He added that when losses become large, investors stop averaging, liquidity in the secondary market declines, selling pressure rises, and stocks can fall further, sometimes leading to margin calls.","Of the 140 stocks in the BSE MidCap index, 86 ended the year with negative returns, while in the BSE SmallCap index, 871 of the 1,186 stocks were in the red."
"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade JSW Energy, SJVN, Alkem Labs, BSE, State Bank of India, and others on January 13?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-jsw-energy-sjvn-alkem-labs-bse-state-bank-of-india-and-others-on-january-13-13769531.html,"Equity benchmarks bounced back with 0.4 percent gains on January 12, but market breadth remained weak, with 1,866 shares declining against 1,044 advancing shares on the NSE. The market may extend its upward journey, but sustainability remains the key factor to watch. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi SJVN | CMP: Rs 80.53 SJVN registered a decisive breakout on January 2 above the Rs 76.5 level, supported by a strong surge in volumes, confirming the strength of the move. Over the last 2–3 sessions, the stock witnessed a healthy pullback towards the breakout zone, accompanied by declining volumes, indicating a classic low-volume retest. Currently, price action has reversed from this support area, suggesting renewed buying interest. On the hourly chart, the DMI has generated a bullish crossover, while the ADX is placed well above the threshold of 20, currently around 32.5, highlighting strong trend momentum. This combination of price, volume, and momentum signals strengthens the bullish outlook. Hence, SJVN is expected to witness a fresh bullish move in the coming few sessions, with the breakout zone now acting as a strong support base. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 81–79 zone, with a target of Rs 86. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 86 Stop-Loss: Rs 76 JSW Energy | CMP: Rs 498.8 JSW Energy has recently confirmed a bullish breakout from an inverse Head and Shoulder pattern, supported by a strong surge in volumes, which validates the reliability of the formation. This breakout indicates a clear shift from a corrective phase to a potential trend reversal on the upside. The stock is currently reversing after witnessing a mild pullback, but the decline is accompanied by relatively low volumes, suggesting that selling pressure is weak and the move is more of a healthy retest rather than a breakdown. Importantly, the weekly pivot support is closely aligned with the neckline of the pattern, strengthening the support zone. This confluence enhances the probability of a fresh upward move from current levels. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 500–490 zone, with a target of Rs 550. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 550 Stop-Loss: Rs 475 Rail Vikas Nigam | CMP: Rs 331.65 RVNL has witnessed a sharp correction after a strong up-move and is now approaching a crucial support zone in the Rs 330–320 range. This zone coincides with prior consolidation and visible demand on the chart, indicating that accumulation interest is likely to emerge at lower levels. On the daily timeframe, the stock has slipped back into the Ichimoku cloud after facing rejection near the upper band. This suggests a transition from a strong bullish phase to a corrective or consolidation phase. However, as long as Rs 303 is protected on a closing basis, the broader price structure remains intact and supportive of a potential trend resumption. Momentum indicators also reflect a healthy reset. The RSI has cooled off from overbought levels and is currently hovering near 45, indicating normalization rather than weakness. Overall, the setup favours a pullback-led rebound once stability is established near the support zone. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 333–327 zone, with a target of Rs 364. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 364 Stop-Loss: Rs 303 Jay Thakkar, Vice President & Head of Derivatives and Quant Research at ICICI Securities Alkem Laboratories | CMP: Rs 5,867 Alkem Labs has witnessed some long additions amid its recent uptrend, and the stock has also provided a breakout from the falling trendline. During the recent market correction, the stock did not correct and instead consolidated within a range of Rs 5,600–5,800, and now appears ready for an upside breakout. The stock has the highest Call open interest at Rs 6,000 and faces no major resistance ahead. Hence, the short-term target is Rs 6,000, and beyond that Rs 6,100, while immediate support is seen at Rs 5,750 levels. Buy Alkem Labs Futures in the range of Rs 5,850–5,970. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 6,000, Rs 6,100 Stop-Loss: Rs 5,750 Hindustan Zinc | CMP: Rs 628.25 Hindustan Zinc has corrected in the short term; however, this was mainly on account of profit booking. Hence, dips should be utilised as a buying opportunity. The stock appears to have consolidated within a short-term range of Rs 650–590 and now has significant support in the Rs 590–600 zone, while on the upside, Rs 660 is the minimum target. Although there is huge Call open interest at higher levels, there was significant Call unwinding in the last trading session, indicating that as long as the stock is trading well above its maximum pain level of Rs 620, the short-term trend remains positive. Buy Hindustan Zinc Futures in the range of Rs 625–630. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 650, Rs 660 Stop-Loss: Rs 615 Info Edge India | CMP: Rs 1,312.9 Info Edge had been consolidating within a range of Rs 1,400–1,300 for quite some time, and the breakdown below this range, along with an increase in open interest, indicates short build-up. Earlier, the stock had fallen due to long unwinding; however, it now appears that short positions are being added, which is a negative sign for the stock going ahead. There have been significant Call additions in the Rs 1,320–1,400 strikes, which is a negative indicator. However, the Rs 1,260–1,280 strikes have seen good Put additions as well, so a break below those levels could lead to a major sell-off. Until then, the stock may consolidate for some time, but eventually it looks relatively weak. The stock is now trading below its maximum pain as well as VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price), both of which will act as crucial resistances in the near term. Sell Info Edge Futures in the range of Rs 1,320–1,300. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 1,250, Rs 1,200 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,365 Vidnyan S Sawant, Head of Research at GEPL Capital Ramco Cements | CMP: Rs 1,083.5 Ramco Cements is showing a positive multi-timeframe setup. On the monthly chart, the stock has posted three consecutive bullish mean reversions from the 12-month EMA and is holding above the previous month’s high, indicating strengthening momentum. On the weekly scale, it is building a base near the 50% Fibonacci retracement and the 50-week EMA, supported by a pickup in volumes above the 20-week average. A bullish MACD crossover further reinforces the constructive outlook and signals potential continuation of the uptrend. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,170 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,040 BSE | CMP: Rs 2,790.6 BSE continues to exhibit strong relative strength on the weekly chart, trading in a tight range around the 12-week EMA despite heightened market volatility. On the daily timeframe, volumes have expanded above the 20-day average while the stock sustains above the 26-DEMA, indicating active participation and trend support. The weekly RSI near 60 further confirms sustained bullish momentum. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,096 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,678 State Bank of India | CMP: Rs 1,015.15 SBI has been exhibiting a strong and orderly uptrend since February 2025, marked by a gradual rise and a robust price structure. The stock remains well placed above its key 12- and 26-week EMAs, indicating healthy trend strength. On the daily chart, SBI has shown a bullish mean reversion from the 12-DEMA, while the RSI continues to hold above 60 across timeframes, confirming sustained bullish momentum. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,086 Stop-Loss: Rs 975 SBI Life Insurance Company | CMP: Rs 2,098 SBI Life Insurance continues to trade within a well-defined long-term rising channel since 2021, reflecting a strong structural uptrend. The stock remains comfortably placed above its 12- and 26-week EMAs, while the daily chart highlights notable resilience amid broader market volatility. Momentum remains firmly supportive, with the RSI holding above 60 on both the weekly and daily timeframes, confirming a well-established uptrend backed by strength. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,308 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,014","The stock appears to have consolidated within a short-term range of Rs 650–590 and now has significant support in the Rs 590–600 zone, while on the upside, Rs 660 is the minimum target.","Although there is huge Call open interest at higher levels, there was significant Call unwinding in the last trading session, indicating that as long as the stock is trading well above its maximum pain level of Rs 620, the short-term trend remains positive.","This zone coincides with prior consolidation and visible demand on the chart, indicating that accumulation interest is likely to emerge at lower levels.","The stock appears to have consolidated within a short-term range of Rs 650–590 and now has significant support in the Rs 590–600 zone, while on the upside, Rs 660 is the minimum target."

The Metropolitan Stock Exchange (MSE) is set to begin its operations and trading is expected to begin on the new exchange within the next two weeks, CNBC-Awaaz reported citing sources. As liquidity remains a concern around a new stock exchange, MSE has planned a comprehensive liquidity enhancement scheme under which it will appoint market makers to provide liquidity support for approximately 130 stocks, the channel added. MSE has raised Rs 1,240 crore in two tranches in December 2024 and August 2025, which saw participation from major brokerage houses Groww and Zerodha. However, analysts said that breaking the NSE-BSE duopoly may not be easy as they hold strong market shares, the channel added. According to data cited by the report, NSE holds approximately 90-92 percent share, while BSE holds 8-10 percent share in the cash segment. In stock futures and options (F&O), NSE holds around 95 percent share, while BSE holds around 5 percent share. In index F&O, NSE holds nearly 80 percent share, and BSE holds approximately 20 percent share. Moneycontrol couldn't independently verify the report. Notably, market regulator SEBI in 2025 introduced new rules to allow only two weekly equity derivatives expiries in any segment during the week. Currently, NSE has Nifty 50 expiry on Tuesdays, while BSE has Sensex expiry on Thursdays. A new stock exchange on the market may face competition and the risk of low liquidity as a result of this. Earlier, MSE had introduced a Liquidity Enhancement Scheme (LES) in its Equity and Equity Derivatives segments. Then known as MCX Stock Exchange, it had introduced the scheme in 2013 in order to encourage participation in these segments. ""The MCX-SX Liquidity Enhancement Scheme will appoint 3 market makers for futures contract in 50 liquid scrips. These market makers are incentivized to ensure that quotes and depth is available. For other stock futures, options and equity cash, all participants are incentivized to maintain passive orders which will help in building depth,"" it had said.","Earlier, MSE had introduced a Liquidity Enhancement Scheme (LES) in its Equity and Equity Derivatives segments.","As liquidity remains a concern around a new stock exchange, MSE has planned a comprehensive liquidity enhancement scheme under which it will appoint market makers to provide liquidity support for approximately 130 stocks, the channel added.","For other stock futures, options and equity cash, all participants are incentivized to maintain passive orders which will help in building depth,"" it had said.","The Metropolitan Stock Exchange (MSE) is set to begin its operations and trading is expected to begin on the new exchange within the next two weeks, CNBC-Awaaz reported citing sources."

Click to View More Outlook for January 13 Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities After showing sharp weakness in the last few sessions, Nifty witnessed an excellent bounce back from the lows on Monday and closed the day with decent gains of around 106 points. After opening on a weak note, Nifty slipped into weakness in the early part of the session. A sharp recovery has emerged from the lows of 25473 levels and the market sustained the gains till the end. A long bull candle has been formed on the daily chart with long lower shadow. Technically, this market action is indicating significant turnaround in the market for the short term. This is positive indication one may expect further upside in the short term. The underlying trend of Nifty seems to have turned up post sharp weakness of last week. Having recovered from the key lower levels decisively, Nifty could advance towards the next hurdle of 26000-26100 levels in the next few sessions. Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities Today, the benchmark indices witnessed a sharp recovery from the lower levels. The Nifty ended 107 points higher, while the Sensex was up by 302 points. Among sectors, the Metal Index outperformed today, rallying over 2 percent, whereas the Realty and Media indices shed over 1 percent. Technically, after an early morning intraday sharp selloff, the market took support near 25,500/82,700 and bounced back sharply. From the day's lowest point, the market bounced back over 300/1,200 points, which is largely positive. We are of the view that the intraday market texture is positive, but buy on dips and sell on rallies would be the ideal strategy for day traders. On the downside, 25,650/83,500 and 25,600/83,300 would act as key support zones, while 25,900-25,950/84,300-84,500 could serve as immediate resistance areas for the bulls. However, below 25,600/83,300, sentiment could change. If that happens, traders may consider exiting their long positions.

Notably, India-US trade deal has seen significant delays, putting pressure on markets for most of 2025 on the back of rising Trump tariffs. Analysts had noted that markets may see some rally in case of any positive news around this front. Sergio also referred to strategic initiatives like Pax Silica, calling it a US-led framework with India as a key partner. “Both sides continue to actively engage. Not an easy to cross the finish line, but determined,” he said, underscoring the challenges and commitment in ongoing talks. Senator Marco Rubio added, “This year will be a year of reciprocity,” highlighting the mutual intent to enhance cooperation across trade and strategic sectors.

For Bank Nifty, the 20-day SMA at 59,500 would act as a key level for traders, said Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities. He added that below this mark, the correction wave is likely to continue until 58,800–58,500. Conversely, above 59,500, it could bounce back up to 59,800–59,000, the analyst added. Choice Broking meanwhile saw immediate support near 59,000, and said that a breakdown could open the door toward 58,900–58,800. On the upside, 59,500–59,600 remains a strong resistance band, and only a decisive move above this zone would revive bullish sentiment, it added.

He further added that both the countries continue to engage actively, and the next call on the much-awaited trade deal will take place tomorrow. ""President TRUMP will be visiting India in next 1-2 years hopefully,"" he added. While assuming charge in New Delhi on Monday, Gor said that Trump had conveyed his best wishes to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, referring to the relationship between the two leaders as genuine. ""Real friends can disagree, but resolve the difference,"" Gor said, framing current trade negotiations as part of a broader, resilient partnership. Notably, India-US trade deal has seen significant delays, putting pressure on markets for most of 2025 on the back of rising Trump tariffs. Analysts had noted that markets may see some rally in case of any positive news around this front. Sergio also referred to strategic initiatives like Pax Silica, calling it a US-led framework with India as a key partner. “Both sides continue to actively engage. Not an easy to cross the finish line, but determined,” he said, underscoring the challenges and commitment in ongoing talks. Senator Marco Rubio added, “This year will be a year of reciprocity,” highlighting the mutual intent to enhance cooperation across trade and strategic sectors.

The 5,000 m3 /hour green hydrogen plant was commissioned in Nov’25 for captive consumption of JSW Group’s steel plant, which is located at an adjacent site. Green hydrogen’s economics remain challenging vs. conventional fuels, and current costs continue to hover around USD3.5-4/Kg vs. the USD 2-2.5/Kg level required to achieve mass-scale commercialization. The floating solar plant with a capacity of 20 MW was commissioned in Sep’25 and is a novel concept, which eliminates land acquisition requirement, provides natural cooling (thus boosting generation by slowing down module degradation), though IRRs are broadly similar to ground-mounted solar plants. JSWE has nearly doubled its operational installed capacity from 7.2GW in FY24 end to 13.2GW as of 2QFY26, underscoring strong execution capabilities. The reduction in merchant exposure to ~5% of the installed base significantly enhances its cash flow stability. With a project pipeline of 17.2GW, of which ~74% is already secured under longterm PPAs, the company remains on track to achieve its targeted generation capacity of 30GW by FY30.

However, growth momentum remains capped, with L2L moderating to 5.6% in Q3FY26 (vs ~8.3% in Q3FY25; ~6.8% in Q2FY26), alongside store productivity still below pre-Covid levels. The staples-led mix and calibrated DMart ReADY expansion support earnings visibility and downside protection, but limit ticket expansion and operating leverage amid rising competition and urban basket fragmentation.

Hold Avenue Supermarts; target of Rs 3783: Prabhudas Lilladher,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/hold-avenue-supermarts-target-of-rs-3783-prabhudas-lilladher-13767995.html,"Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Avenue Supermarts We raise our FY26/FY27/FY28 EPS estimates by 4.6%/3.5%/3.3% as 3Q26 profits beat estimates led by higher gross margins and benefits of cost control. D’Mart’s Q3FY26 results beat our estimates at the EBITDA/PAT level by 9.2%/10.2%, led by lower overheads and healthy gross margins, despite 11bps YoY increase in cost of retailing and 36bps QoQ decline in GM&A contribution. Operating parameters continue to remain weak with sales/store down 1.1%, sales/ft down 0.3%, bills cuts/store/day decline of 2.1% YoY (flat in last 2 years) and flattish average bill value YoY. Interest burden also increased from Rs505mn to Rs1011bn in 9mFY26, in line with our expectations, which makes D’Mart an ideal candidate for equity dilution. The company added 10 stores in Q3FY26; we expect store additions to accelerate in Q4, with total openings of 57/65/70 in FY26/FY27/FY28. For Q4FY26, we forecast GM/EBITDA margins of 14.2%/7.1% on a low base, translating into healthy double-digit PAT growth. Outlook However, intensifying competition from quick commerce across FMCG/nonFMCG, deteriorating mix and volatile store economics raise concerns over the long-term sustainability of these margins. We estimate 12.5% EPS CAGR over FY26–28 and arrive at DCF based TP of Rs3783 (Rs3736 earlier, roll over to FY28) Given rich valuations at 65.5x FY28E EPS, we maintain HOLD, with back ended returns.

"DMart shares jump 3% to hit one-month high after Q3 results, rally despite still-cautious brokerage views",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/dmart-shares-jump-3-to-hit-one-month-high-after-q3-results-rally-despite-still-cautious-brokerage-views-13767936.html,"Shares of Avenue Supermarts (DMart) rose sharply on Monday, hitting a one-month high and extending gains after its Q3FY26 results, even as several brokerages remain cautious to bearish on the stock’s medium-term outlook. DMart stock climbed 2.4 percent to Rs 3,892.6, after touching an intra-day high of Rs 3,918.6 (up 3.1 percent). At current levels, Avenue Supermarts commands a market capitalisation of about Rs 2.53 lakh crore and is up around 11 percent over the past year. The buying interest follows a margin-led earnings beat in the October-December quarter. Avenue Supermarts, which operates the DMart retail chain, reported a 17 percent year-on-year rise in net profit to Rs 856 crore, while revenue grew 13.3 percent to Rs 18,101 crore. EBITDA rose over 20 percent, with margins expanding to 8.1 percent, aided by lower discounting after GST changes and favourable category mix. The rally in DMart stock has played out ahead of brokerage comfort. Post-quarterly results notes from Citi, Jefferies and Nuvama flagged muted same-store (LFL) growth of 5.6 percent and raised concerns around the sustainability of margin gains, particularly amid intensifying competition from quick-commerce platforms. Citi has a ‘Sell’ call on the stock, while Jefferies and Nuvama are at ‘Hold’. In contrast, Motilal Oswal has reiterated a ‘Buy’ rating with a target price of Rs 4,600, implying about 21 percent upside from current levels. The brokerage cited the profitability beat and gross-margin recovery, while also flagging pricing competition from quick commerce as a key near-term risk. Brokerages have also pointed to subdued like-for-like growth trends and the upcoming CEO transition as factors that could keep sentiment guarded despite the recent stock move.

Lemon Tree Hotels shares jump today on Warburg-led restructuring; brokerages see value unlocking,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/lemon-tree-hotels-shares-jump-today-on-warburg-led-restructuring-brokerages-see-value-unlocking-13767843.html,"Shares of Lemon Tree Hotels Ltd rose nearly 2 percent on Monday, extending recent gains. Investors reacted positively to the company’s sweeping restructuring plan, the entry of private equity major Warburg Pincus, and bullish brokerage commentary pointing to value unlocking and balance-sheet deleveraging. Lemon Tree Hotels stock was trading at Rs 152.8 at about 9:50 am, up 2 percent, after hitting an intraday high of Rs 155.99. Lemon Tree shares are up 11.6 percent over the past one year, valuing the company at under Rs 12,100 crore. The proposed scheme of arrangement will split the group into two focused platforms -- an asset-light hotel management and brand entity under Lemon Tree Hotels; and an asset-heavy ownership and development platform under Fleur Hotels. As part of the transaction, Warburg Pincus will acquire APG’s entire 41.09 percent stake in Fleur Hotels and has committed to invest Rs 960 crore in Fleur in tranches to support future expansion. Post-restructuring, Lemon Tree Hotels shareholders will directly own 32.96 percent of Fleur Hotels, with Lemon Tree itself holding 41.03 percent and Warburg Pincus owning the remaining 26.01 percent. Fleur Hotels will own 41 hotels with 5,813 keys, while Lemon Tree Hotels will manage 89 hotels with 6,011 keys under an asset-light model. Brokerages remain constructive on the stock, citing sharper business focus, improved capital structure and clearer valuation discovery. Nuvama has issued a ‘Buy’ rating on Lemon Tree Hotels with a target price of Rs 178 per share. The brokerage said the composite reorganisation and Warburg’s entry as a strategic investor in Fleur Hotels meaningfully strengthens the group’s long-term profile. Nuvama added that Warburg’s buyout of APG’s stake effectively reintroduces the global private equity firm to the capital table and de-risks future large-scale capital expenditure at Fleur. Investec, which has a ‘Buy’ rating and a higher target price of Rs 187, said the long-awaited Fleur demerger should unlock value in Lemon Tree’s high-growth, high return on capital employed, asset-light business. The brokerage expects Lemon Tree to emerge as a zero-debt platform, free from a leveraged ownership structure, while Warburg’s Rs 960 crore committed infusion is seen as a key driver of Fleur’s growth. Investec also said that management’s reaffirmation of its growth strategy adds comfort for shareholders. Lemon Tree Hotels' management has indicated that Fleur Hotels will be listed as a separate entity within the next 12 to 15 months, and that Lemon Tree will announce a dividend distribution policy after the scheme is completed.
