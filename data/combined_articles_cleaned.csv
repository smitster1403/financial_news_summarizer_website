Alaska Airlines grounds all flights after a tech outage,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/alaska-airlines-grounds-all-flights-after-a-tech-outage-2025-07-21/,"Alaska Airlines grounded all its flights due to an undisclosed technical error affecting its entire system, the carrier announced early Monday. “We are currently experiencing an IT outage that's impacting our operations. We requested a temporary, system-wide ground stop until the issue is resolved,” the Seattle-based company said in a social media post. It advised customers to check the status of their flights before heading to an airport. The Federal Aviation Administration website indicated a ground stop for Alaska Airlines at all airports beginning shortly before 3 a.m. Monday due to an airline request. A second post on the FAA site indicated a ground stop for all Alaska mainline and Horizon aircraft, referring to an Alaska Airlines subsidiary. The National Transportation Board last month credited the crew of Alaska Airlines flight 1282 with the survival of passengers when a door plug panel flew off the plane shortly after takeoff on Jan. 5, 2024, leaving a hole that sucked objects out of the cabin. In September, Alaska Airlines said it grounded its flights in Seattle briefly due to “significant disruptions” from an unspecified technology problem that was resolved within hours.","A second post on the FAA site indicated a ground stop for all Alaska mainline and Horizon aircraft, referring to an Alaska Airlines subsidiary.",The Federal Aviation Administration website indicated a ground stop for Alaska Airlines at all airports beginning shortly before 3 a.m. Monday due to an airline request.,The Federal Aviation Administration website indicated a ground stop for Alaska Airlines at all airports beginning shortly before 3 a.m. Monday due to an airline request.,"The National Transportation Board last month credited the crew of Alaska Airlines flight 1282 with the survival of passengers when a door plug panel flew off the plane shortly after takeoff on Jan. 5, 2024, leaving a hole that sucked objects out of the cabin."
Chinese investors snap up stocks on hopes for an end to price wars and overcapacity,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/chinese-investors-snap-up-stocks-on-hopes-for-an-end-to-price-wars-and-overcapacity-2025-07-21/,"BEIJING (AP) — China’s stock market is buzzing over government promises to tackle price wars that have hurt profits and worsened global trade tensions. The prevailing catchphrase is “anti-involution,” and it reflects efforts to curb intense competition and overcapacity in industries like solar panels, steel, and electric vehicles. With rising trade barriers such as President Donald Trump's higher tariffs, and relatively weak domestic demand, manufacturers have been slashing prices, undermining their bottom lines and driving some out of business. The producer price index, which measures the price that factories receive for their goods, has fallen steadily for nearly three years in China in a prolonged bout of deflation. The long-running issue spilled over into global markets as low-priced Chinese exports worsen trade friction with key trading partners including the United States and Europe. In a series of recent statements, the Chinese government and industry associations have signaled they're getting serious about reining in cut-throat competition, known as invollution or “neijuan” in Chinese. The top 10 makers of glass for solar panels agreed on June 30 to shut kilns and cut production by 30%, an industry association said. The government has launched an auto safety inspection campaign, addressing concerns that automakers were skimping on quality to cut costs. It's unclear whether these efforts will succeed, but the sense that China may finally be tackling this chronic problem was enough to spark a rally in stocks in some of those under-pressure sectors. Shares of Liuzhou Iron & Steel Co. gained 10% on Friday and have risen more than 70% since June 30. Solar panel glass producer Changzhou Almaden Co. fell at the end of last week but is still up about 50%. More broadly, two exchange traded funds in solar panels and steel have risen about 10%, outpacing a 3.2% rise in the Shanghai Composite, China's leading market index. The performance of EV-maker stocks has been mixed, with Li Auto and Nio recording double-digit percentage gains while market leader BYD declined. Foreigners can't buy Chinese stocks directly but they are able to invest in about 2,700 stocks and 250 exchange traded funds through the Hong Kong exchange. The gains follow high-level government pronouncements against disorderly price wars. On June 29, the People's Daily newspaper, the mouthpiece of the ruling Communist Party, ran a lengthy page 1 article on involution, saying they run counter to the party's goal of high quality economic development. Chinese leader Xi Jinping weighed in at a closed-door economic meeting, calling for better regulating competition and incentives by local governments to attract factory investments that are blamed for overinvestment in affected industries. The tougher talk began with a focus on automakers in late May, specifically around electric vehicle price wars that began more than three years ago. Analysts at investment bank UBS said the shift is good news for auto industry profits and company stocks. “Though it’s difficult to imagine a sudden U-turn of the industry from fierce competition to orderly consolidation, it’s indeed possible to have near-term ceasefire of the price war,” they wrote. After BYD launched another round of price cuts on May 23, some competitors, the main industry association and government all called for fair and sustainable competition. The EV battery industry, the cement association and major construction companies have issued statements echoing calls for an end to excess competition. The term involution, which suggests a spiraling inward and shrinking, was initially applied in China to students and young workers, who felt they were caught up in meaningless competition that led nowhere as the job market weakened and wages stagnated in recent years. At the industry level, it has come to mean sectors that have too many companies competing for a slice of the pie, leading to fierce price cutting to try to gain market share. The mismatch between production capacity — how much an industry can make — and actual demand for the product, reflects overcapacity that forces companies to compete for survival in a limited market space, said a recent article in the Communist Party magazine Qiushi. Some Chinese industries, especially steel and cement, have long suffered from overcapacity. A government push to promote green industries has fostered similar problems in that sector, including solar panels, wind turbines and electric vehicles. A flood of Chinese exports is leading to more trade barriers in Europe and the U.S. and in some emerging markets such as Mexico, Indonesia and India. Ultimately, economists say industries need to consolidate through company mergers and bankruptcies. But the process will take time. A major obstacle is provincial governments that want to protect local companies and jobs. Alicia García-Herrero, the chief economist for Asia-Pacific at the Natixis investment bank, said that recent comments by top Chinese economic officials suggest they realize something needs to be done. “How much is action versus words, I don’t know,” she said. “But I do think it’s a big problem for China.” ___ Associated Press researcher Yu Bing contributed.","The top 10 makers of glass for solar panels agreed on June 30 to shut kilns and cut production by 30%, an industry association said.","The mismatch between production capacity — how much an industry can make — and actual demand for the product, reflects overcapacity that forces companies to compete for survival in a limited market space, said a recent article in the Communist Party magazine Qiushi.",BEIJING (AP) — China’s stock market is buzzing over government promises to tackle price wars that have hurt profits and worsened global trade tensions.,"The mismatch between production capacity — how much an industry can make — and actual demand for the product, reflects overcapacity that forces companies to compete for survival in a limited market space, said a recent article in the Communist Party magazine Qiushi."
Asian shares are mixed after Wall Street logs a 3rd straight winning week,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/asian-shares-are-mixed-after-wall-street-logs-a-3rd-straight-winning-week-2025-07-21/,"BANGKOK (AP) — Asian shares are mixed and U.S. futures have edged higher after U.S. stocks logged their third straight winning week. Markets were closed for a holiday in Japan, where the ruling Liberal Democrats have lost their coalition majorities in both houses of parliament for the first time since 1955 following Sunday’s election and the loss of their lower house majority in October. A grim Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has vowed to stay on, but the outcome of the upper house election reflects voters' frustration with rising prices and political instability. Analysts said they expect his weakened government to crank up spending, adding to Japan's huge debt burden. Japan is also facing the imposition of 25% tariffs across the board on its exports to the U.S. as talks with the Trump administration appear to have made little headway. “We expect short-term political instability to intensify due to the difficulties of forming a majority coalition, a likely change in leadership, and a potential deadlock in trade negotiations,” Peter Hoflich of BMI, a part of the Fitch Group, said in a commentary. “Without a structural reset through snap elections, Japan is likely to face prolonged policy drift throughout 2026,” he said. Chinese shares advanced after the central bank kept its key 1-year and 5-year loan prime interest rates unchanged. Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.3% to 24,895.20, while the Shanghai Composite index gained 0.4% to 3,549.89. Recent stronger economic data have eased pressure on the Chinese leadership to soften credit. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump's administration has softened its criticism of Beijing, raising hopes that the two sides can work out a trade deal and avert the imposition of sharply higher tariffs on imports from China. South Korea's Kospi picked up 0.5% to 3,205.71 after the government reported a slight improvement in exports in June. In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 shed 1.1% to 8,659.50, while Taiwan's Taiex dropped 0.3%. In India, the Sensex rose 0.2%, while Bangkok's SET was down 0.5%. This week will bring updates on U.S. home sales, jobless claims and manufacturing. Several Big Tech companies including Alphabet and Tesla are due to provide earnings reports. On Friday, the S&P 500 handed back less than 1 point after setting an all-time high the day before. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3% and the Nasdaq composite edged up by less than 0.1% to add its own record. Norfolk Southern chugged 2.5% higher after an AP source said it was discussing a merger with Union Pacific to create the largest railroad in North America, one that would connect the East and West coasts. Any such deal, though, would likely face tough scrutiny from U.S. regulators. Union Pacific’s stock fell 1.2%. The heaviest weight on the market, meanwhile, was Netflix, which fell 5.1% despite reporting a stronger-than-expected profit. Exxon Mobil sank 3.5% and also tugged on the market. It had been challenging Chevron’s $53 billion deal to buy Hess, but an arbitration ruling in Paris about Hess assets off Guyana’s coast allowed the buyout to go through. Chevron fell 0.9% after losing an early gain. Treasury yields eased after a report suggested U.S. consumers may be feeling less fearful about coming inflation. They’re bracing for inflation of 4.4% in the year ahead, down from last month’s projection of 5%, according to preliminary results from a University of Michigan survey. Prices may already be starting to feel the upward effects of President Donald Trump' s higher tariffs, according to data released last week. The Trump administration is preparing to impose steeper import duties on many countries as of Aug. 1, although some have worked out deals to mitigate some of the damage. In other trading early Monday, U.S. benchmark crude oil gained 14 cents to $66.19 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, added 10 cents to $69.38 per barrel. The U.S. dollar rose to 148.50 Japanese yen from 147.98 yen. The euro slipped to $1.1628 from $1.1629.

Court rules Mississippi's social media age verification law can go into effect,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/court-rules-mississippis-social-media-age-verification-law-can-go-into-effect-2025-07-20/,"A Mississippi law that requires social media users to verify their ages can go into effect, a federal court has ruled. A tech industry group has pledged to continue challenging the law, arguing it infringes on users’ rights to privacy and free expression. A three-judge panel of the 5th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals overruled a decision by a federal district judge to block the 2024 law from going into effect. It's the latest legal development as court challenges play out against similar laws in states across the country. Parents — and even some teens themselves — are growing increasingly concerned about the effects of social media use on young people. Supporters of the new laws have said they are needed to help curb the explosive use of social media among young people, and what researchers say is an associated increase in depression and anxiety. Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch argued in a court filing defending the law that steps such as age verification for digital sites could mitigate harm caused by “sex trafficking, sexual abuse, child pornography, targeted harassment, sextortion, incitement to suicide and self-harm, and other harmful and often illegal conduct against children.” Attorneys for NetChoice, which brought the lawsuit, have pledged to continue their court challenge, arguing the law threatens privacy rights and unconstitutionally restricts the free expression of users of all ages. The industry group, which has filed similar lawsuits in Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Ohio and Utah, represents some of the country's most high-profile technology companies, including Google, which owns YouTube; Snap Inc., the parent company of Snapchat; and Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram. In a written statement, Paul Taske, co-director of the NetChoice Litigation Center, said the group is “very disappointed” in the decision to let Mississippi's law go into effect and is “considering all available options.” “NetChoice will continue to fight against this egregious infringement on access to fully protected speech online,"" Taske said. ""Parents — not the government — should determine what is right for their families.” ___ Kate Payne is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

‘Superman’ flexes its might in second weekend with $57.3 million,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/superman-flexes-its-might-in-second-weekend-with-573-million-2025-07-20/,"NEW YORK (AP) — James Gunn’s “Superman” showed staying power in its second weekend at North American box offices, collecting $57.3 million in ticket sales and remaining the No. 1 movie in cinemas, according to studio estimates Sunday. None of the week's new releases — “I Know What You Did Last Summer,” “Smurfs,” and “Eddington” — came close to touching Warner Bros. and DC Studios’ superhero success. “Superman” dipped 54% from its domestic opening, an average decline for a big summer film. In two weeks, “Superman” has grossed $406.8 million worldwide, a good start for the movie DC Studios is banking on to restart its movie operations. A big test looms next weekend, when the Walt Disney Co. releases Marvel's “The Fantastic Four: First Steps.” Strong audience scores and good reviews should help propel the $225 million-budgeted “Superman” toward profitability in the coming weeks. For Warner Bros. and DC Studios, “Superman” is key to kicking off a 10-year plan for the comic book adaptation studio. Co-heads Gunn and Peter Safra were tasked with rehabilitating the flagging operation. Next on tap are the films “Supergirl” and “Clayface” in 2026. But “Superman” is far from flying solo in theaters right now. Universal Pictures’ “Jurassic World: Rebirth” came in second this weekend, with $23.4 million in its third week of release. The seventh “Jurassic” movie, this one starring Scarlett Johansson, held its own despite the competition from “Superman.” In three weeks, it accrued $648 million worldwide. Apple Studios and Warner Bros.’ “F1: The Movie” has also shown legs, especially internationally. In its fourth weekend, the Brad Pitt racing drama dipped just 26% domestically, bringing in $9.6 million in North America, and another $29.5 million overseas. Its global total stands at $460.8 million. But both of the biggest new releases — Sony Pictures’ “I Know What You Did Last Summer” and Paramount Pictures’ “Smurfs” — fell flat. “I Know What You Did Last Summer” opened with $13 million, a fair result for a movie budgeted at a modest $18 million, but a disappointing opening for a well-known horror franchise. The film, directed by Jennifer Kaytin Robinson, is set 27 years after the 1997 original. Teenagers played by Madelyn Cline and Chase Sui Wonders are again haunted for covering up a car accident. The movie's reviews (38% “fresh” on Rotten Tomatoes) were poor for “I Know What You Did Last Summer” and audiences graded it similarly. The film notched a “C+” on CinemaScore. The original collected $72.6 million in its domestic run in 1997. Paramount Pictures’ “Smurfs” debuted in fourth place this weekend with $11 million. The latest big-screen reboot for the woodland blue creatures prominently features Rihanna as the voice of Smurfette. But reviews (21% “fresh” on Rotten Tomatoes) were terrible. Audiences were kinder, giving it a “B+” on CinemaScore, but the $58 million-budgeted release will depend largely on its international sales. In 56 overseas markets, “Smurfs” earned $22.6 million. Ari Aster’s “Eddington” opened with $4.2 million on 2,111 screens for A24. Since its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival, “Eddington” has been particularly divisive. The pandemic-set Western features Joaquin Phoenix as the right-wing sheriff of a small New Mexico town who faces off with its liberal mayor (Pedro Pascal). While Aster’s first film, 2018’s “Hereditary” ($82.8 million worldwide against a $10 million budget) helped establish A24 as an indie powerhouse, but the less-than-stellar launch of “Eddington” marks the second box-office disappointment for Aster. His 2023 film “Beau Is Afraid” cost $35 million to make but collected just $12.4 million worldwide. “Eddington” cost about $25 million to produce. Audiences gave it a “C+” on CinemaScore. None of Aster’s previous films have been graded higher. Yet collectively, Hollywood is enjoying a very good summer. According to data firm Comscore, the 2025 summer box office is up 15.9% over the same period last year, with the year-to-date sales running 15% ahead of 2025. Summer ticket sales have amassed about $2.6 billion domestically, according to Comscore. With final domestic figures being released Monday, this list factors in the estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore: 1. “Superman,” $57.3 million. 2. “Jurassic World Rebirth,” $23.4 million. 3. “I Know What You Did Last Summer,” $13 million. 4. “Smurfs,” $11 million. 5, “F1: The Movie,” $9.6 million. 6. “How to Train Your Dragon,” $5.4 million. 7. “Eddington,” $4.3 million. 8. “Elio,” $2 million. 9. “Lilo & Stitch,” $1.5 million. 10. “28 Years Later,” $1.3 million. ___ This story has been updated to correct the title of “Hereditary.”","In two weeks, “Superman” has grossed $406.8 million worldwide, a good start for the movie DC Studios is banking on to restart its movie operations.","None of the week's new releases — “I Know What You Did Last Summer,” “Smurfs,” and “Eddington” — came close to touching Warner Bros. and DC Studios’ superhero success.","With final domestic figures being released Monday, this list factors in the estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore: 1.","“I Know What You Did Last Summer” opened with $13 million, a fair result for a movie budgeted at a modest $18 million, but a disappointing opening for a well-known horror franchise."
3 Streaming Stocks to Watch as Subscribers Drive Growth,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/3-streaming-stocks-to-watch-as-subscribers-drive-growth/,"The retail sales report for June showed a slight increase in consumer discretionary spending. One month doesn’t make a pattern, but it’s at least a temporary relief for companies that rely on consumers willing to stretch their budgets for their products and services. One area that’s remained strong among consumer discretionary stocks is streaming services. Despite claims of streaming fatigue, many consumers find that they’ll get rid of many things in their budget before they give up their streaming services. The companies that offer these services have noticed and found a way to be more profitable. They offer a discounted monthly service price and make up for it with ad revenue. As we move into earnings season, investors will hear which of these companies stand out among the rest. One of the key metrics they’ll use to judge that performance will be the company’s subscriber numbers. Here are three companies to watch. Netflix Inc. NASDAQ: NFLX invented the streaming category and in the last few years, the company’s strategic pivots to increase monetization without alienating its subscriber base is truly impressive. That growth has continued in 2025. The company’s first-quarter earnings report delivered 12% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth and 27% YOY earnings per share (EPS) growth, setting the bar high for the company’s earnings report, which was released on July 17. Analysts have been projecting 22% earnings growth for the full year. Since the beginning of July, investors have been unplugging from NFLX stock. That's not surprising, the stock is priced to perfection and, at 59x earnings, it’s trading at about a 30% premium to its historic average. Being priced for perfection may be why NFLX stock is pulling back from its all-time highs. But many investors thought the same thing when the stock was around $1,000. Throughout July, Netflix has received several bullish upgrades, suggesting analysts believe the company will continue to post strong results that can support a move to new highs. The Walt Disney Company NYSE: DIS is in the middle of an impressive comeback. That comeback was almost derailed in early August when tariff and inflation concerns dropped the stock to its 52-week low. However, DIS stock has come roaring back and is up more than 43% in the last three months. A key reason for that is the company’s streaming operation, which turned a profit for the first time. Disney isn’t a pure-play streaming stock by any means. Streaming via its Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ platforms accounts for only about 25% of the company’s annual revenue. Nevertheless, it’s an integral part of the company’s business model because it provides predictable revenue that is more defensive than its theme park and cruise line operations. Several analysts raised their price targets on DIS stock in July. At 24x earnings, the stock has attractive value, which includes a recently reinstated dividend. However, investors may have to wait for the company’s earnings on August 5 for a catalyst that could send the stock to multi-year highs. Roku Inc. NASDAQ: ROKU is intriguing because it offers consumers both the lock and the key to streaming. In this case, the lock is its smart TVs and Roku sticks, which are the gateway to streaming services. The company offers the top-selling TV operating system (OS) in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The key is how the company monetizes viewership. This is done in several ways. The most obvious is through ad revenue. Roku sells ad space during programming on The Roku Channel and keeps 100% of the ad revenue for content it owns or licenses. However, the company also gets a percentage of ad revenue for third-party content. It also receives a commission on every subscriber it brings to other streaming services. This combination positions Roku to continue winning the connected television (CTV) space. However, ROKU stock is up 55% in the last three months and is within 2.4% of its consensus price target of $92.67. Several analysts have offered higher price targets, but Roku is not yet profitable. Therefore, investors should be cautious when trading the stock before its earnings report on July 30. The MACD isn’t showing a strong signal either way, but since the recent trend was bullish, it suggests the stock may be losing its upward momentum. Before you consider Roku, you'll want to hear this.",Roku Inc.

America Wants Drone Dominance: Are These Stocks Ready to Soar?,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/america-wants-drone-dominance-are-these-stocks-ready-to-soar/,"The recent passage of the Trump administration’s One Big, Beautiful Bill provides $150 billion in additional defense spending. That pushes total U.S. defense spending close to $1 trillion. That’s a lot of zeroes to digest. But if you’re an investor, there’s a reason to believe you can profit from this additional spending. That’s because the Pentagon is in the early stages of a five- to ten-year push to modernize the U.S. military. A key part of that effort will be a shift toward drone-centric and autonomous systems. This focus means looking beyond some of the large-cap defense stocks like Lockheed Martin Corp. NYSE: LMT and General Dynamics NYSE: GD. These companies will have a seat at the table, but the table has a few more place settings. Those will be occupied by smaller, niche companies that specialize in the drone industry. Several of these aerospace stocks have shot higher in the past few months, which is giving some investors that FOMO (fear of missing out) feeling. There’s no doubt that risk-tolerant investors with a long timeline should consider investing in this sector. But you may not have to go all in just yet. Several of these stocks have extended valuations. Over the next several years, investors can expect some ups and downs that will allow a position to build over time. Here are three stocks worth considering and how they fit into this emerging sector. Any time investors are considering speculative stocks, they should keep a close eye on the balance sheet. That’s a good reason to consider AeroVironment Inc. NASDAQ: AVAV. The company is an industry leader that is already supplying small tactical drones to the United States military and its allies. That gives AeroVironment something that many companies in this sector lack: growing revenue and positive earnings. In its last quarter, revenue was up 39% year-over-year (YOY), and earnings per share increased by a whopping 274% YOY. Those numbers were a key reason AVAV stock gapped higher after its June earnings report. However, the company isn’t resting on its laurels and announced plans to raise up to $1.5 billion in new capital. AVAV stock is down about 6% since that announcement. That’s not surprising. Raising capital in this way is often dilutive to a company’s share price in the short term. However, investors may want to buy this dip. To begin with, the company has a strong backlog backed by expanding margins. AeroVironment isn’t raising cash to stay afloat; it’s doing so to manage that growth. From a tactical perspective, AVAV stock is extended trading at 78x forward earnings. Investors will often pay a premium for industry leaders in an emerging sector, but with the stock up more than 71% in 2025, this is a healthy pullback that will give investors time to enter or add to a position. Red Cat Holdings NASDAQ: RCAT is a small-cap stock focusing on rugged, military-grade drones through its Teal Drones subsidiary. The company has won contracts with the U.S. Army and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. However, this just emphasizes the lumpiness that can come with government funding cycles. That shows up on the company’s balance sheet. The company is not profitable and is generating very little revenue. It's projecting around $80-$120 million in revenue for 2025 and just completed a $30 million equity offering in April. With the equity offering behind it, RCAT stock has gone up more than 100% in the last three months. Some of that, however, may be from short covering as the stock has over 20% short interest. The upside could be meaningful if Red Cat can grow into its valuation and convert contract wins into scalable revenue. For risk-tolerant investors, RCAT stock is a long-term moonshot worth monitoring. However, scaling in slowly may help mitigate near-term downside. Since the passage of the One Big, Beautiful Bill, the Pentagon has expressed its intention to “unleash U.S. drone dominance.” Kratos Defense & Security Solutions NASDAQ: KTOS may play a key role in making this a reality. The company’s experimental Valkyrie program features low-cost, autonomous tactical drones that can be deployed in swarms. The Pentagon has prioritized this for many years. While the Valkyrie program offers great promise, the company is currently generating revenue from target drones and satellite communication systems for the U.S. military. Kratos generated approximately $1 billion in revenue in 2024 and is profitable. The company's positioning between small-cap agility and large-cap infrastructure would seem to make KTOS stock a Goldilocks option for investors. However, after surging 98% in 2025, the stock looks overvalued and overbought.

"Indonesian passenger ferry catches fire at sea, killing at least 5",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/indonesian-passenger-ferry-catches-fire-at-sea-killing-at-least-5-2025-07-20/,"MANADO, Indonesia (AP) — A passenger ferry carrying hundreds of people caught fire at sea on Sunday off Sulawesi island in Indonesia, killing at least five people, officials said. More than 280 people were rescued and evacuation efforts were ongoing. The KM Barcelona 5 was headed to Manado, the capital of North Sulawesi province, from Talaud, an island district in the province when it caught fire in waters near Talise, said Vice Adm. Denih Hendrata, commander of the Indonesian Fleet Command. He said that three navy ships had been deployed, and 284 passengers and crew members had been evacuated so far. The rescue operation included assistance from local fishermen, who saved some survivors wearing life jackets as they were drifting to nearby islands in the choppy waters. Rescuers retrieved five bodies, including a pregnant woman. There were no immediate reports of injuries, and no exact figures of passengers and crew members onboard the ferry. “We are still focusing on evacuation efforts,” Hendrata said, adding that the cause of the fire was being investigated. Photos and videos released by the National Search and Rescue Agency showed terrified passengers, mostly wearing life jackets, jumping into the sea. Orange flames and black smoke billowed from the burning vessel. Indonesia is an archipelago of more than 17,000 islands where ferries are a common method of travel. Disasters occur regularly, with weak safety enforcement often blamed. Residents of Mentawai Islands found several people stranded on July 14 after a speedboat carrying 18 people capsized during a storm the day before, authorities said. All were in good condition. A ferry sank near Indonesia’s resort island of Bali early this month, leaving at least 19 dead and 16 others missing. A two-week search operation involved more than 1,000 rescuers, three navy ships, 15 boats, a helicopter and divers.",More than 280 people were rescued and evacuation efforts were ongoing.,"MANADO, Indonesia (AP) — A passenger ferry carrying hundreds of people caught fire at sea on Sunday off Sulawesi island in Indonesia, killing at least five people, officials said.","A ferry sank near Indonesia’s resort island of Bali early this month, leaving at least 19 dead and 16 others missing.","The KM Barcelona 5 was headed to Manado, the capital of North Sulawesi province, from Talaud, an island district in the province when it caught fire in waters near Talise, said Vice Adm.

Russia insists on achieving Ukraine goals despite Trump's ultimatum,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/russia-insists-on-achieving-ukraine-goals-despite-trumps-ultimatum-2025-07-20/,"Russia is open to peace with Ukraine, but achieving its goals remains a priority, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Sunday, days after U.S. President Donald Trump gave Moscow a 50-day deadline to agree to a ceasefire or face tougher sanctions. Peskov and other Russian officials have repeatedly rejected accusations from Kyiv and its Western partners of stalling peace talks. Meanwhile, Moscow continues to intensify its long-range attacks on Ukrainian cities, launching more drones in a single night than it did during some entire months in 2024, and analysts say the barrages are likely to escalate. Russian President Vladimir Putin “has repeatedly spoken of his desire to bring the Ukrainian settlement to a peaceful conclusion as soon as possible. This is a long process, it requires effort, and it is not easy,” Peskov told state television in an interview. “The main thing for us is to achieve our goals,"" he said. “Our goals are clear.” The Kremlin has insisted that any peace deal should see Ukraine withdraw from the four regions that Russia illegally annexed in September 2022, but never fully captured. It also wants Ukraine to renounce its bid to join NATO and accept strict limits on its armed forces — demands Kyiv and its Western allies have rejected. In his nightly address on Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that his officials have proposed a new round of peace talks this week. Russian state media on Sunday reported that no date has yet been set for the negotiations, but said that Istanbul would likely remain the host city. Trump threatened Russia on July 14 with steep tariffs and announced a rejuvenated pipeline for American weapons to reach Ukraine, hardening his stance toward Moscow after months of frustration following unsuccessful negotiations aimed at ending the war. The direct Russia-Ukraine negotiations in Istanbul resulted in several rounds of prisoner exchanges but little else. The U.S. president said that he would implement “severe tariffs” unless a peace deal is reached within 50 days. He provided few details on how they would be implemented, but suggested they would target Russia’s trading partners in an effort to isolate Moscow in the global economy. In addition, Trump said that European allies would buy “billions and billions” of dollars of U.S. military equipment to be transferred to Ukraine, replenishing the besieged country’s supplies of weapons. Included in the plan are Patriot air defense systems, a top priority for Ukraine as it fends off Russian drones and missiles. Doubts were recently raised about Trump’s commitment to supply Ukraine when the Pentagon paused shipments over concerns that U.S. stockpiles were running low. Elsewhere, Ukraine’s air force said that it shot down 18 of 57 Shahed-type and decoy drones launched by Russia overnight into Sunday, with seven more disappearing from radar. Two women were wounded in Zaporizhzhia, a southern Ukrainian region partly occupied by Russia, when a drone struck their house, according to the regional military administration. Two more civilians were wounded in Ukraine's northeastern Kharkiv province, after a drone slammed into a residential building, local Ukrainian officials said. Later Sunday, drones struck a leafy square in the center of Sumy, wounding a woman and her 7-year-old son, officials said. The strike also damaged a power line, leaving around 100 households without electricity, according to Serhii Krivosheienko, of the municipal military administration. Meanwhile, Russia's Defense Ministry said that its forces shot down 93 Ukrainian drones targeting Russian territory overnight, including at least 15 that appeared to head for Moscow. At least 13 more drones were downed on the approach to the capital on Sunday, Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said. One drone struck a residential building in Zelenograd, on the outskirts of Moscow, damaging an apartment, but caused no casualties, he said. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine","Meanwhile, Russia's Defense Ministry said that its forces shot down 93 Ukrainian drones targeting Russian territory overnight, including at least 15 that appeared to head for Moscow.","Russia is open to peace with Ukraine, but achieving its goals remains a priority, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Sunday, days after U.S. President Donald Trump gave Moscow a 50-day deadline to agree to a ceasefire or face tougher sanctions.","Trump threatened Russia on July 14 with steep tariffs and announced a rejuvenated pipeline for American weapons to reach Ukraine, hardening his stance toward Moscow after months of frustration following unsuccessful negotiations aimed at ending the war.","Russia is open to peace with Ukraine, but achieving its goals remains a priority, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Sunday, days after U.S. President Donald Trump gave Moscow a 50-day deadline to agree to a ceasefire or face tougher sanctions."
3 Retailers Poised to Outmaneuver Tariff and Recession Concerns,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/3-retailers-poised-to-outmaneuver-tariff-and-recession-concerns/,"Several months into the Trump administration's unfolding tariff program, investors are still unlikely to have much clarity surrounding the impact of current and potential future levies. However, as inflation creeps upward once again and analysts continue to forecast a decent likelihood of an impending recession, it would seem to be an increasingly challenging time for companies dependent upon consumer spending. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF NYSEARCA: XRT, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) and benchmark for the U.S. retail industry, has partially recovered from the initial April tariff shock but remains down more than 1% year-to-date (YTD). At the same time that some retailers are struggling to adapt to shifting economic conditions and tariff landscapes, others may be able to buck the trend and thrive thanks to their unique focus or business model. Below, we explore three companies—an off-price retailer, an e-commerce provider, and a specialty footwear firm—that analysts believe could outperform despite a challenging environment. TJX Companies NYSE: TJX, the company behind discount and closeout shops like T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, and HomeGoods, has only slightly outperformed the XRT since the start of the year. TJX has maintained brick-and-mortar strength even as shopping trends have shifted online, thanks to its distinguished model, in which customers search through stores for discounted finds. The firm also maintains its cost efficiency by focusing on overstocked inventory, which it can then turn around and sell below competitor prices. The proof is in TJX's earnings, and the company recently came out ahead of analyst predictions for both revenue and EPS. Revenue climbed by more than 5% year-over-year (YOY), a sign that both U.S. and, increasingly, international operations are growing well. TJX also offers the bonus of a solid dividend, with a yield of 1.41% and a healthy payout ratio suggesting continued long-term dividend sustainability. Management recently boosted the company's dividend payout, further solidifying optimism in the company's ability to withstand external pressures. Nineteen out of 20 analysts see TJX shares as a Buy, predicting that the stock could rise by more than 17% based on a price target of $141.06. Investors should keep in mind, however, that with a trailing P/E ratio of 28.7, TJX stock may not offer the most compelling value at this time. Global-e Online Ltd. NASDAQ: GLBE offers a cloud-based platform to facilitate international retail transactions. The company doesn't interface directly with consumers, but rather connects businesses via its services. GLBE's inclusion in a list of retail-focused firms able to successfully navigate a complex tariff situation may be surprising, given its international focus. However, the company's business clients are predominantly high-end and luxury brands, including Hugo Boss, Parisian shoe brand Carel, Iconic London, Loquet, and others. Customers seeking out the brands doing business with Global-e likely have significant flexibility on their discretionary spending, with or without tariffs. What's more, Global-e is expanding its partnerships in a big way—the company recently announced a major multi-year agreement with commerce platform Shopify Inc. NYSE: SHOP—a move that should help it continue to grow its top line. There is already noteworthy momentum there, as Global-e announced quarterly revenue growth of 30% YOY for the latest quarter, coming in above analyst predictions. Analysts are bullish on GLBE shares, with 12 out of 13 calling them a Buy. A consensus price target of $48 per share suggests 49% upside potential. Boot Barn NYSE: BOOT is a footwear and apparel retailer that serves customers interested in Western-inspired fashion and those looking for durable workwear. Consolidated same-store sales growth for the latest fiscal year was 5% YOY, and the firm is looking to increase its store count by 14%. The company, which relies on products from China and Mexico, has taken a sensible approach to pricing and forecasting given the tariff uncertainty. Even still, it is projecting 13% growth in total net sales. Unlike the two companies above, BOOT shares are notably up in recent months. The stock has risen by almost 9% YTD and an impressive 27% in the last year. Analysts remain optimistic about future growth despite the recent rally; a consensus price target close to $174 means the company has over 5% in upside potential based on the latest predictions. Twelve out of 13 analysts say BOOT is a Buy.

D-Day veteran and TikTok star 'Papa Jake' Larson dies at 102,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/d-day-veteran-and-tiktok-star-papa-jake-larson-dies-at-102-2025-07-20/,"PARIS (AP) — D-Day veteran ″Papa Jake″ Larson, who survived German gunfire on Normandy's bluffs in 1944 and then garnered 1.2 million followers on TikTok late in life by sharing stories to commemorate World War II and his fallen comrades, has died at 102. An animated speaker who charmed strangers young and old with his quick smile and generous hugs, the self-described country boy from Minnesota was ‘’cracking jokes til the end,'' his granddaughter wrote in announcing his death. Tributes to him quickly filled his “Story Time with Papa Jake"" TikTok account from across the United States, where he had been living in Lafayette, California. Towns around Normandy, still grateful to Allied forces who helped defeat the occupying Nazis in World War II, paid him homage too. ""Our beloved Papa Jake has passed away on July 17th at 102 years young,"" granddaughter McKaela Larson posted on his social media accounts. “He went peacefully.” “As Papa would say, love you all the mostest,” she wrote. Born Dec. 20, 1922, in Owatonna, Minnesota, Larson enlisted in the National Guard in 1938, lying about his age since he was only 15 at the time. In 1942, he was sent overseas and was stationed in Northern Ireland. He became operations sergeant and assembled the planning books for the invasion of Normandy. He was among the nearly 160,000 Allied troops who stormed the Normandy shore on D-Day, June 6, 1944, surviving machine-gun fire when he landed on Omaha Beach. He made it unhurt to the bluffs that overlook the beach, then studded with German gun emplacements that mowed down American soldiers. “We are the lucky ones,” Larson told The Associated Press at the 81st anniversary of D-Day in June, speaking amid the immaculate rows of graves at the American cemetery overlooking Omaha Beach. “We are their family. We have the responsibility to honor these guys who gave us a chance to be alive.” He went on to fight through the Battle of the Bulge, a grueling month-long fight in Belgium and Luxembourg that was one of the defining moments of the war and of Hitler's defeat. His service earned him a Bronze Star and a French Legion of Honor award. In recent years, Larson made repeated trips to Normandy for D-Day commemorations — and at every stop, “Papa Jake” was greeted by people asking for a selfie. In return, he offered up a big hug, to their greatest joy. One memorable encounter came in 2023, when he came across Bill Gladden, a then-99-year-old British veteran who survived a glider landing on D-Day and a bullet that tore through his ankle. “I want to give you a hug, thank you. I got tears in my eyes. We were meant to meet,” Larson told Gladden, as their hands, lined and spotted with age, clasped tightly. Gladden died the following year. In his TikTok posts and interviews, Larson combined humorous anecdotes with somber reminders about the horrors of war. Reflecting to AP on the three years he was in Europe, Larson said he is “no hero.” Speaking in 2024, he also had a message to world leaders: “Make peace not war.” He often called himself “the luckiest man in the world,” and expressed awe at all the attention he was getting. “I’m just a country boy. Now I’m a star on TikTok,” he told AP in 2023. ""I’m a legend! I didn’t plan this, it came about.” Small-town museums and groups around Normandy that work to honor D-Day's heroes and fallen shared tributes online to Larson, one of their most loyal visitors. “He was an exceptional witness and bearer of memory,” the Overlord Museum posted on Facebook. “He came every year to the museum, with his smile, his humility and his tales that touched all generations. His stories will continue to live. Rest in peace Papa Jake,” it read. “Thanks for everything.”","We have the responsibility to honor these guys who gave us a chance to be alive.” He went on to fight through the Battle of the Bulge, a grueling month-long fight in Belgium and Luxembourg that was one of the defining moments of the war and of Hitler's defeat.","PARIS (AP) — D-Day veteran ″Papa Jake″ Larson, who survived German gunfire on Normandy's bluffs in 1944 and then garnered 1.2 million followers on TikTok late in life by sharing stories to commemorate World War II and his fallen comrades, has died at 102.","Tributes to him quickly filled his “Story Time with Papa Jake"" TikTok account from across the United States, where he had been living in Lafayette, California.","Reflecting to AP on the three years he was in Europe, Larson said he is “no hero.” Speaking in 2024, he also had a message to world leaders: “Make peace not war.” He often called himself “the luckiest man in the world,” and expressed awe at all the attention he was getting."
Typhoon Wipha topples trees and causes major flight disruptions in Hong Kong and southern China,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/typhoon-wipha-topples-trees-and-causes-major-flight-disruptions-in-hong-kong-and-southern-china-2025-07-20/,"HONG KONG (AP) — Typhoon Wipha toppled trees and caused major flight disruptions Sunday in Hong Kong and at some nearby airports in China as it moved west off the southern coast of the country. Airports in Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Zhuhai and the casino hub of Macao canceled or postponed flights for most of the day, according to their websites. Hong Kong grounded at least 400 flights, affecting around 80,000 passengers, broadcaster RTHK said. Some high-speed train services were also suspended. The typhoon stayed just offshore until about 6 p.m., when it made landfall in a coastal area of Taishan city in Guangdong province, China's National Meteorological Center said. It then weakened to a severe tropical storm with maximum sustained winds of 108 kph (67 mph). Earlier Sunday, the Hong Kong Observatory issued a hurricane signal No. 10, its highest warning. The eye of the storm passed just south of the city around midday with maximum sustained winds of 140 kph (87 mph), the observatory said. The high winds brought down trees in Zhuhai and other cities on China's southern coast. In Hong Kong, vehicles weaved around branches strewn on the streets. The government said that it had received more than 450 reports of fallen trees and that 26 people had sought medical treatment at public hospitals. A statement didn't provide details on any injuries. More than 250 people had sought refuge in public shelters, the statement said. Hong Kong Disneyland and other amusement parks were closed. The storm, which reached typhoon strength overnight, later passed off Macao and was forecast to make landfall on China's coast late Sunday. It is expected to reach Vietnam later this week. Wipha, which is a Thai name, passed over the Philippines at tropical storm strength and drenched parts of Taiwan on Saturday. Names for typhoons in the western Pacific are chosen by the countries in the region. In the Philippines, the storm intensified seasonal monsoon rains, leaving at least one villager dead in floodwaters in northern Cagayan province. More than 370,000 people have been affected by days of stormy weather, including 43,000 who fled to government-run emergency shelters or homes of relatives because of flooding, landslides and fierce winds. More than 400 houses were damaged, officials said. Elsewhere in Asia, five days of torrential rain in South Korea has left 14 people dead and 12 others missing, the government said Sunday.",HONG KONG (AP) — Typhoon Wipha toppled trees and caused major flight disruptions Sunday in Hong Kong and at some nearby airports in China as it moved west off the southern coast of the country.,"The eye of the storm passed just south of the city around midday with maximum sustained winds of 140 kph (87 mph), the observatory said.","The storm, which reached typhoon strength overnight, later passed off Macao and was forecast to make landfall on China's coast late Sunday.",HONG KONG (AP) — Typhoon Wipha toppled trees and caused major flight disruptions Sunday in Hong Kong and at some nearby airports in China as it moved west off the southern coast of the country.
Ishiba's coalition loses majority in Japan's upper house election,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/japans-governing-coalition-likely-to-lose-upper-house-election-exit-polls-show-2025-07-20/,"TOKYO (AP) — Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba ’s ruling coalition failed Monday to secure a majority in the 248-seat upper house in a crucial parliamentary election, further shaking the stability of his government as Japan faces challenges such as rising prices and high U.S. tariffs. Ishiba’s Liberal Democratic Party and its junior coalition partner Komeito, which needed to win 50 seats on top of the 75 seats they already have to retain their majority, won 47 seats. It was three seats short of a majority and a retreat of 19 seats from before the vote. The loss is another blow to Ishiba’s coalition, making it a minority in both houses following its October defeat in the lower house election, and worsening Japan’s political instability. It was the first time the LDP-led coalition has lost a majority in both houses of parliament since the party’s formation in 1955. Despite the loss, Ishiba expressed determination to stay on and not create a political vacuum to tackle challenges such as U.S. tariff threats, but he could face calls from within his party to step down or find another coalition partner. “I will fulfill my responsibility as head of the No. 1 party and work for the country,” he said. Ishiba had set the bar low, wanting a simple majority of 125 seats, which means his LDP and its Buddhist-backed junior coalition partner Komeito needed to win 50 seats. Exit poll results released seconds after the ballots closed Sunday night mostly showed a major setback for Ishiba’s coalition. The LDP alone won 39 seats, better than most exit poll projections of 32, and still the No. 1 party in the parliament, known as the Diet. But Ishiba said the coalition's poor showing was because his government’s measures to combat price increases had yet to reach many people. “It's a tough situation. I take it humbly and sincerely,” Ishiba told a live interview with NHK. The poor performance in the election will not immediately trigger a change of government because the upper house lacks the power to file a no-confidence motion against a leader, but it will certainly deepen uncertainty over his fate and Japan’s political stability. Ishiba could face calls from within the LDP party to step down or find another coalition partner. Soaring prices, lagging incomes and burdensome social security payments are the top issues for frustrated, cash-strapped voters. Stricter measures targeting foreign residents and visitors also emerged as a key issue, with a surging right-wing populist party leading the campaign. Sunday's vote comes after Ishiba's coalition lost a majority in the October lower house election, stung by past corruption scandals, and his unpopular government has since been forced into making concessions to the opposition to get legislation through parliament. It has been unable to quickly deliver effective measures to mitigate rising prices, including Japan's traditional staple of rice, and dwindling wages. U.S. President Donald Trump has added to the pressure, complaining about a lack of progress in trade negotiations and the lack of sales of U.S. autos and American-grown rice to Japan despite a shortfall in domestic stocks of the grain. A 25% tariff due to take effect Aug. 1 has been another blow for Ishiba. Ishiba resisted any compromise before the election, but the prospect of a breakthrough after the election is just as unclear because the minority government would have difficulty forming a consensus with the opposition. Frustrated voters were rapidly turning to emerging populist parties. The eight main opposition groups, however, were too fractured to forge a common platform as a united front and gain voter support as a viable alternative. The emerging populist party Sanseito stands out with the toughest anti-foreigner stance, with its “Japanese First” platform that proposes a new agency to handle policies related to foreigners. The party’s populist platform also includes anti-vaccine, anti-globalism and favors traditional gender roles. Conservative opposition groups, especially the DPP and Sanseito, gained significant ground at the Liberal Democrats’ expense, while the centrist top opposition CDPJ was sluggish. The DPP quadrupled to 17 seats from four, according to interim results reported by Japanese media. Sanseito surged to 14 from just one. Sanseito leader, former local assembly member and a Self-Defense Force reserve personnel, told NHK said he is open to cooperate with the ruling bloc on conservative policies while waiting to gain more seats in the other house in a next election and form a multi-party coalition as in Europe. None of the opposition parties said that they were open to cooperating with the governing coalition. CDPJ leader Yoshihiko Noda told NHK that his priority is to form an alliance among the opposition. “Public opinion clearly said ‘no’ to the Ishiba government,” Noda said. The spread of xenophobic rhetoric in the election campaign and on social media triggered protests by human rights activists and alarmed foreign residents. The LDP has almost continuously dominated Japan's postwar politics, contributing to its political stability and social conformity. But voters are divided between stability and change, with some voicing concern about escalating xenophobia. Yuko Tsuji, a 43-year-old consultant who came to a polling station inside a downtown Tokyo gymnasium with her husband, said they both support LDP for stability and unity. They voted “for candidates who won't fuel division."" “If the ruling party doesn’t govern properly, the conservative base will drift toward extremes. So I voted with the hope that the ruling party would tighten things up,” she said. Self-employed Daiichi Nasu, 57, who came to vote with his dog, said he hopes for a change toward a more inclusive and diverse society, with more open immigration and gender policies such as allowing married couples to keep separate surnames. “That’s why I voted for the CDPJ,” he said. “I want to see progress on those fronts.” ___ Associated Press journalist Reeno Hashimoto contributed to this report.","The loss is another blow to Ishiba’s coalition, making it a minority in both houses following its October defeat in the lower house election, and worsening Japan’s political instability.","Despite the loss, Ishiba expressed determination to stay on and not create a political vacuum to tackle challenges such as U.S. tariff threats, but he could face calls from within his party to step down or find another coalition partner.",Exit poll results released seconds after the ballots closed Sunday night mostly showed a major setback for Ishiba’s coalition.,"The poor performance in the election will not immediately trigger a change of government because the upper house lacks the power to file a no-confidence motion against a leader, but it will certainly deepen uncertainty over his fate and Japan’s political stability."
"Less selection, higher prices: How tariffs are shaping the holiday shopping season",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/less-selection-higher-prices-how-tariffs-are-shaping-the-holiday-shopping-season-2025-07-20/,"NEW YORK (AP) — With summer in full swing in the United States, retail executives are sweating a different season. It’s less than 22 weeks before Christmas, a time when businesses that make and sell consumer goods usually nail down their holiday orders and prices. But President Donald Trump's vacillating trade policies, part of his effort to revive the nation’s diminished manufacturing base and to reduce the U.S. deficit in exported goods, have complicated those end-of-year plans. Balsam Hill, which sells artificial trees and other decorations online, expects to publish fewer and thinner holiday catalogs because the featured products keep changing with the tariff — import tax — rates the president sets, postpones and revises. “The uncertainty has led us to spend all our time trying to rejigger what we’re ordering, where we’re bringing it in, when it’s going to get here,” Mac Harman, CEO of Balsam Hill parent company Balsam Brands, said. “We don’t know which items we’re going to have to put in the catalog or not."" Months of confusion over which foreign countries' products may become more expensive to import has left a question mark over the holiday shopping season. U.S. retailers often begin planning for the winter holidays in January and typically finalize the bulk of their orders by the end of June. The seesawing tariffs already have factored into their calculations. The consequences for consumers? Stores may not have the specific gift items customers want come November and December. Some retail suppliers and buyers scaled back their holiday lines rather than risking a hefty tax bill or expensive imports going unsold. Businesses still are setting prices but say shoppers can expect many things to cost more, though by how much depends partly on whether Trump's latest round of “reciprocal” tariffs kicks in next month. The lack of clarity has been especially disruptive for the U.S. toy industry, which sources nearly 80% of its products from China. American toy makers usually ramp up production in April, a process delayed until late May this year after the president put a 145% tariff on Chinese goods, according to Greg Ahearn, president and CEO of the Toy Association, an industry trade group. The U.S. tariff rate may have dropped significantly from its spring high — a truce in the U.S.-China trade war is set to expire on Aug. 12 — but continues to shape the forthcoming holiday period. Manufacturing activity is way down from a year ago for small- and medium-sized U.S. toy companies, Ahearn said. The late start to factory work in China means holiday toys are only now arriving at U.S. warehouses, industry experts said. A big unknown is whether tariffs will keep stores from replenishing supplies of any breakout hit toys that emerge in September, said James Zahn, editor-in-chief of the trade publication Toy Book. In the retail world, planning for Christmas in July usually involves mapping out seasonal marketing and promotion strategies. Dean Smith, who co-owns independent toy stores JaZams in Princeton, New Jersey, and Lahaska, Pennsylvania, said he recently spent an hour and a half running through pricing scenarios with a Canadian distributor because the wholesale cost of some products increased by 20%. Increasing his own prices that much might turn off customers, Smith said, so he explored ways to ""maintain a reasonable margin without raising prices beyond what consumers would accept.” He ordered a lower cost Crazy Forts building set so he would have the toy on hand and left out the kids' edition of the Anomia card game because he didn't think customers would pay what he would have to charge. “In the end, I had to eliminate half of the products that I normally buy,” Smith said. Hilary Key, owner of The Toy Chest in Nashville, Indiana, said she tries to get new games and toys in early most years to see which ones she should stock up on for the winter holidays. This year, she abandoned her product testing for fear any delayed orders would incur high import taxes. Meanwhile, vendors of toys made in China and elsewhere bombarded Key with price increase notices. For example, Schylling, which makes Needoh, Care Bear collectibles and modern versions of nostalgic toys like My Little Pony, increased prices on orders by 20%, according to Key. All the price hikes are subject to change if the tariff situation changes again. Key worries her store won’t have as compelling a product assortment as she prides herself on carrying. “My concern is not that I’ll have nothing, because I can bring in more books. I can bring in more gifts, or I can bring in just things that are manufactured in other places,” she said. “But that doesn’t mean I’m going to have the best stock for every developmental age, for every special need."" The retail industry may have to keep taking a whack-a-mole approach to navigating the White House's latest tariff ultimatums and temporary reprieves. Last week, the president again reset the rates on imports from Brazil, the European Union, Mexico, and other major trading partners but said they would not take effect until Aug. 1. The brief pause should extend the window importers have to bring in seasonal merchandise at the current baseline tariff of 10%. The Port of Los Angeles had the busiest June in its 117-year history after companies raced to secure holiday shipments, and July imports look strong so far, according to Gene Seroka, the port's executive director. “In my view, we're seeing a peak season push right now to bring in goods ahead of potentially higher tariffs later this summer,"" Seroka said Monday. The pace of port activity so far this year reflects a “tariff whipsaw effect” — imports slowing when tariffs kick in and rebounding when they're paused, he said. “For us consumers, lower inventory levels, fewer selections and higher prices are likely as we head into the holidays.” Smith, who co-owns the two JaZams stores with his partner, Joanne Farrugia, said they started placing holiday orders two months earlier than usual for “certain items that we felt were essential for us to have at particular pricing.” They doubled their warehouse space to store the stockpile. But some shoppers are trying to get ahead of higher prices just like businesses are, he said. He's noticed customers snapping up items that will likely be popular during the holidays, like Jellycat plush toys and large stuffed unicorns and dogs. Any sales are welcome, but Smith and Farrugia are wary of having to restock at a higher cost. “We’re just trying to be as friendly as we can to the consumer and still have a product portfolio or profile that is gonna meet the needs of all of our various customers, which is getting more and more challenging by the day,” Smith said. Balsam Brands' Harman said he's had to resign himself to not having as robust a selection of ornaments and frosted trees to sell as in years' past. Soon, it will be too late to import meaningful additions to his range of products. “Our purpose as a company is to create joy together, and we’re going to do our very best to do that this year,"" Harman said. “We’re just not going to have a bunch of the items that consumers want this year, and that’s not a position we want to be in.""","“We’re just not going to have a bunch of the items that consumers want this year, and that’s not a position we want to be in.""","“For us consumers, lower inventory levels, fewer selections and higher prices are likely as we head into the holidays.” Smith, who co-owns the two JaZams stores with his partner, Joanne Farrugia, said they started placing holiday orders two months earlier than usual for “certain items that we felt were essential for us to have at particular pricing.” They doubled their warehouse space to store the stockpile.","Businesses still are setting prices but say shoppers can expect many things to cost more, though by how much depends partly on whether Trump's latest round of “reciprocal” tariffs kicks in next month.","“We’re just trying to be as friendly as we can to the consumer and still have a product portfolio or profile that is gonna meet the needs of all of our various customers, which is getting more and more challenging by the day,” Smith said."
Trump administration imposes limits on Mexican flights and threatens Delta alliance in trade dispute,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-administration-imposes-limits-on-mexican-flights-and-threatens-delta-alliance-in-trade-dispute-2025-07-19/,"The Trump administration imposed new restrictions Saturday on flights from Mexico and threatened to end a longstanding partnership between Delta Air Lines and Aeromexico in response to limits the Mexican government placed on passenger and cargo flights into Mexico City several years ago. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Mexico's actions to force airlines to move out of the main Benito Juarez International Airport to the newer Felipe Angeles International Airport more than 30 miles (48.28 kilometers) away violated a trade agreement between the two countries and gave domestic airlines an unfair advantage. Mexico is the top foreign destination for Americans with more than 40 million passengers flying there last year. ""Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg deliberately allowed Mexico to break our bilateral aviation agreement,” Duffy said, referring to the previous president and his transportation secretary. “That ends today. Let these actions serve as a warning to any country who thinks it can take advantage of the U.S., our carriers, and our market. America First means fighting for the fundamental principle of fairness.” All Mexican passenger, cargo and charter airlines will now be required to submit their schedules to the Transportation Department and seek government approval of their flights until Duffy is satisfied with the way Mexico is treating U.S. airlines. It's not immediately clear how Duffy's actions might affect the broader trade war with Mexico and negotiations over tariffs. A spokesperson for Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum didn’t reply immediately to a request for comment. Sheinbaum didn’t mention the new restrictions during either of her two speaking events on Saturday. Delta and Aeromexico have been fighting the Transportation Department's efforts to end their partnership that began in 2016 since early last year. The airlines have argued that it's not fair to punish them for the Mexican government's actions, and they said ending their agreement would jeopardize nearly two dozen routes and $800 million in benefits to both countries' economies that come from tourism spending and jobs. “The U.S. Department of Transportation’s tentative proposal to terminate its approval of the strategic and pro-competitive partnership between Delta and Aeromexico would cause significant harm to consumers traveling between the U.S. and Mexico, as well as U.S. jobs, communities, and transborder competition,"" Delta said in a statement. Aeromexico’s press office said it was reviewing the order and intended to present a joint response with Delta in the coming days. But the order terminating approval of the agreement between the airlines wouldn't take effect until October, and the airlines are likely to continue fighting that decision. The airlines said in a previous filing fighting the order that it believes the loss of direct flights would prompt over 140,000 American tourists and nearly 90,000 Mexican tourists not to visit the other country and hurt the economies of both countries with the loss of their spending. ___ Associated Press writer Amaranta Marentes in Mexico City contributed to this report.","America First means fighting for the fundamental principle of fairness.” All Mexican passenger, cargo and charter airlines will now be required to submit their schedules to the Transportation Department and seek government approval of their flights until Duffy is satisfied with the way Mexico is treating U.S. airlines.","The airlines said in a previous filing fighting the order that it believes the loss of direct flights would prompt over 140,000 American tourists and nearly 90,000 Mexican tourists not to visit the other country and hurt the economies of both countries with the loss of their spending.",Delta and Aeromexico have been fighting the Transportation Department's efforts to end their partnership that began in 2016 since early last year.,"The airlines said in a previous filing fighting the order that it believes the loss of direct flights would prompt over 140,000 American tourists and nearly 90,000 Mexican tourists not to visit the other country and hurt the economies of both countries with the loss of their spending."
Tech company CEO resigns after controversy over video captured at Coldplay concert,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/tech-company-ceo-resigns-after-controversy-over-video-captured-at-coldplay-concert-2025-07-19/,"The IT company CEO captured in a widely circulated video showing him embracing an employee at a Coldplay concert has resigned. Andy Byron resigned from his job as CEO of Cincinnati-based Astronomer Inc., according to a statement posted on LinkedIn by the company Saturday. “Astronomer is committed to the values and culture that have guided us since our founding. Our leaders are expected to set the standard in both conduct and accountability, and recently, that standard was not met,” the company said in its post on LinkedIn. The move comes a day after the company said that Byron had been placed on leave and the board of directors had launched a formal investigation into the jumbotron incident, which went viral. A company spokesman later confirmed in a statement to AP that it was Byron and Astronomer chief people officer Kristin Cabot in the video. The short video clip shows Byron and Cabot as captured on the jumbotron at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, during a Coldplay concert on Wednesday. Lead singer Chris Martin asked the cameras to scan the crowd for his “Jumbotron Song,” when he sings a few lines about the people the camera lands on. “Either they’re having an affair or they’re just very shy,” he joked. Internet sleuths identified the man as the chief executive officer of a U.S.-based company and the woman as its chief people officer. Pete DeJoy, Astronomer’s cofounder and chief product officer, has been tapped as interim CEO while the company conducts a search for Byron’s successor. It’s easy to miss, but most concert venues have signs informing the audience that they could be filmed during the event. Look for them on the walls when you arrive and around the bar areas or toilets. It’s common practice especially when bands like to use performances for music videos or concert films. The venue in this case, Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, also has a privacy policy online which states: “When you visit our location or attend or participate in an event at our location, we may capture your image, voice and/or likeness, including through the use of CCTV cameras and/or when we film or photograph you in a public location.” “They probably would have got away with it if they hadn’t reacted,” said Alison Taylor, a clinical associate professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business. And by the time the alleged identities emerged on social media, it hit a classic nerve around “leaders acting like the rules don’t apply to them,” she added. Still, Taylor and others stress how quickly such a video can lead to an internet search to find the people involved — and note that it’s important to remember that such “doxing” isn’t just reserved for famous people. Beyond someone simply spotting a familiar face and spreading the word, technological advances, such as the rising adoption of artificial intelligence, have made it easier and faster overall to find just about anyone in a viral video today. “It’s a little bit unsettling how easily we can be identified with biometrics, how our faces are online, how social media can track us — and how the internet has gone from being a place of interaction, to a gigantic surveillance system,” said Mary Angela Bock, an associate professor in the University of Texas at Austin’s School of Journalism and Media. “When you think about it, we are being surveilled by our social media. They’re tracking us in exchange for entertaining us.” _____ AP Business Writer Wyatte Grantham-Philips contributed to this report from New York.",A company spokesman later confirmed in a statement to AP that it was Byron and Astronomer chief people officer Kristin Cabot in the video.,"“It’s a little bit unsettling how easily we can be identified with biometrics, how our faces are online, how social media can track us — and how the internet has gone from being a place of interaction, to a gigantic surveillance system,” said Mary Angela Bock, an associate professor in the University of Texas at Austin’s School of Journalism and Media.","Andy Byron resigned from his job as CEO of Cincinnati-based Astronomer Inc., according to a statement posted on LinkedIn by the company Saturday.","The venue in this case, Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, also has a privacy policy online which states: “When you visit our location or attend or participate in an event at our location, we may capture your image, voice and/or likeness, including through the use of CCTV cameras and/or when we film or photograph you in a public location.” “They probably would have got away with it if they hadn’t reacted,” said Alison Taylor, a clinical associate professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business."
PepsiCo Bottomed Out—Time to Chugalug This Blue-Chip Buy?,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/pepsico-bottomed-outtime-to-chugalug-this-blue-chip-buy/,"PepsiCo’s NASDAQ: PEP stock price sold off for a reason, but the sell-off overextended, and a buying opportunity is at hand. Already struggling with sluggish growth, recall-related issues, and macroeconomic concerns, tariffs and consumer headwinds further pushed the stock price to historical lows. PepsiCo's value is at the extreme low end of the range, and the yield is at the high end, offering a generational buying opportunity. Yielding well over 4% in mid-July, PepsiCo stock is as attractive as it has ever been and has a substantial upside for investors willing to load up and ride the rebound. In the long term, PepsiCo's fundamentals suggest that this stock could rise by 40% to retest the high end of its trading range without considering the addition of growth. Adding revenue and earnings growth into the equation, PepsiCo stock will likely reach new all-time highs; the only question is when. That is the rub for traders; this is a buy-and-hold income stock play with a two- to five-year time horizon. Investors with the patience to hold this consumer staples winner for longer will reap even greater rewards. PepsiCo’s two-year stock price drop was like watching a train wreck slowly unfold. However, as the stock price declined, the volume rose, indicating that only a small portion of the market was selling, while the rest was buying as the share prices fell. The obvious buyers are institutions, and the data tracked by MarketBeat supports this idea. Institutions bought PepsiCo stock on balance in Q1 and Q2 of 2025, ramping their activity toward the quarter's end and carrying over strongly into the first two weeks of Q3. Assuming they remain bullish in Q3, which they likely will due to the valuation/dividend proposition and Q2 results, PepsiCo’s stock price will have a strong institutional tailwind in H2 2025. Likewise, the analysts' sentiment trends align with the price correction and a robust outlook for a rebound. They include a softening of sentiment from Moderate Buy to Hold and a reduction in the consensus price target; however, the price correction is rebounding from the low-end target, and the consensus forecasts a 17% price increase by the year’s end. A move to $158 would align the market with a critical resistance target and potential pivot point, and it would only need a catalyst to drive it to new highs. PepsiCo’s Q2 earnings results serve as a catalyst for the market, with revenue growing 1% to $22.73 billion and outperforming the consensus estimate by 190 basis points. North American Foods and APAC were the only areas of weakness, contracting by 2% and remaining flat, respectively. Meanwhile, organically, PepsiCo Beverage grew by 1%, International Beverage by 5%, Europe, Middle East, and Africa by 7%, and Latin America by 6%. Margin is another area of strength. The company continues to experience margin pressures but is navigating the environment well, producing $2.12 in adjusted earnings, approximately 400 basis points above the consensus figure. The critical details are that full-year guidance for revenue, earnings, and capital was reaffirmed, with first-half momentum expected to lead to second-half strength. Within those details is a forecast for increased capital returns, representing a 5% increase to the dividend and steady buybacks. Buybacks are forecasted to reach $1 billion by year’s end and reduce the share count incrementally. The initial market response to PepsiCo’s Q2 release is bullish. The market rose by over 3% in premarket trading to confirm support at the 30-day exponential moving average (EMA). Support at the 30-day EMA is critical, as it represents short-term traders, value hunters, and buy-and-hold income investors, with potential for further gains. The indicators, including MACD and stochastic, are bullish and poised to send a strong signal at the open. Assuming the market follows through on this, PEP stock should continue the reversal process and begin trending higher before the start of Q4.

Is J.B. Hunt Stock a Sleeping Giant Heading Into 2026?,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/is-jb-hunt-stock-a-sleeping-giant-heading-into-2026/,"J.B. Hunt Transport Services' NASDAQ: JBHT stock price hit bottom earlier this year, setting it up for a significant reversal and potential gains over the next three to five years. The caveat is that it will take time for this shipping giant to regain traction and shift into a more bullish gear. The FQ2 2025 earnings were better than expected, and guidance was optimistic; however, risks remain, including those to capital return. The takeaway for investors is that this transportation stock has set its bottom and is unlikely to reach new lows; however, it will likely remain range-bound in 2025, potentially retesting support at lower levels than where it trades in mid-July, creating a more attractive entry point. The risk to the capital return is significant. While the dividend is safe, the buybacks are not. The company’s Q2 income and free cash flow were insufficient to cover the total CAPEX, dividend, and buybacks, resulting in increased debt compared to the prior year's quarter and year-end. With only $355 million left on the current authorization, the risk is that share repurchases could slow or cease within the next quarter or two, depriving the market of much-needed support until business picks back up. The dividend is reliably safe at less than 30% of the earnings outlook and is still expected to increase annually. The company may slow the pace of dividend distribution increase, but it is unlikely to give up its 20-year history of consecutive increases easily. J.B. Hunt’s Q2 was neither bad nor good, with revenue of $2.93 billion, remaining flat compared to the previous year. The result is driven by strengths in most segments, offset by weaknesses in the same. The strengths include a 6% increase in Intermodal loads and Integrated Capacity Solutions revenue per load, a 3% productivity improvement in the Dedicated Capacity Solutions segment, and a 13% increase in JBT loads. Weaknesses include a 10% decline in Final Mile Services, a 9% decrease in ICS volume, a 3% reduction in DCS trucks, and a decrease in revenue per load in the JBI and JBT segments. Margin is the worst of the news. The company’s focus on efficiency and cost reductions is helping, but it has not fully offset the impacts of inflation. Inflation mainly affects wages, compensation, and insurance costs, which have slightly reduced profit margins. The net result is $197.3 million in operating income, a 4% reduction, and plans to reduce costs by an additional $100 million annually. The company didn’t give specific guidance, but remains optimistic; the outlook for wage and insurance costs is for them to continue rising. J.B. Hunt’s share buybacks set a quarterly record in FQ2 2025, resulting in a 5% average quarterly reduction. The bad news is that buybacks are reflected in the balance sheet with liabilities rising and assets and equity falling. Equity fell by nearly 10% YTD in 2025 and will likely continue eroding until growth is reinvigorated, buybacks or not. The post-release price action isn’t encouraging. The market fell by 1% in pre-market action following losses in the prior session that confirmed resistance at a critical level. The analysts were optimistic ahead of the release, issuing several price target increases that led to a high-end range; however, they may not continue this trend now. A series of price target reductions would put a firm cap on this market, ensuring a move lower in the third quarter. Until then, JBHT is rated as a Moderate Buy with potential for roughly 8% upside.

These 3 Rare Earth Stocks Are Surging Alongside MP Materials,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/these-3-rare-earth-stocks-are-surging-alongside-mp-materials/,"July has proven to be a massive month for rare earth mineral stocks, with MP Materials NYSE: MP at the forefront. On July 10, MP shares surged by nearly 51% after the company announced a multi-billion-dollar commitment from the Department of Defense (DOD). Then, on July 15, MP Materials announced a $500 million partnership with Apple NASDAQ: AAPL. The company will supply 100% recycled rare earth magnets for Apple devices. Shares rose another 20% in response. However, several other rare earth stocks have also seen their shares surge as the industry is having a moment in the sun. Some are making huge moves of their own, while others are rising simply off the back of MP Materials' recent successes. Let’s dive into three of these names below. First up is Critical Metals NASDAQ: CRML, a mining exploration and development company focused on lithium and other rare earth metals. The stock rose 7% after MP announced its DOD deal. However, shares really took off on July 15, as the company made a big announcement on the same day MP revealed the Apple partnership. The company announced it has begun drilling at its Tanbreez Rare Earth Project in Greenland. Particularly important is the fact that the company expects its newly installed drilling rig to significantly increase the size of its Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE). The MRE defines how much rare earth metal geologists believe is in a particular area and provides information on the certainty of these estimates. If Critical Materials increases the MRE estimate and gains a higher level of certainty around it, the value of the project increases. The company has almost no revenue and hopes to change this by getting production at the Tanbreez mine underway in 2026. Shares rose nearly 34% as a result of the announcement. The company also owns the rights to the Wolfsberg Lithium Project. The project is the first fully licensed hard-rock lithium mine in Europe, and the company hopes to begin production in 2026 or 2027. Next up is Ramaco Resources NASDAQ: METC. Since the announcement of MP’s DOD deal, Ramaco shares have been up nearly 73% as of the close of July 15. Shares rose 30% on July 10, as well as 15% on both July 14 and July 15. Ramaco has traditionally been a coal mining company. The company’s latest project is the Brook Mine in Sheridan, Wyoming. There, it plans to extract coal but also wants rare earth minerals. On July 10, the company released an independent preliminary economic assessment (PEA) of the Brook Mine. The PEA found that the mine contains substantial quantities of rare earth elements and is both commercially and technologically feasible. If brought into production, the Brook Mine would be the only other operational rare earths mine in the U.S., besides MP’s Mountain Pass mine in California. It would also stand out from Mountain Pass in its ability to produce a large amount of more valuable heavy rare earth elements. Ramaco believes the mine’s output could meet 30% of the United States defense industry's demand for rare earth magnets. Last up is USA Rare Earth NASDAQ: USAR. Since July 10, shares are up approximately 59% as of the July 15 close. Unlike the other two firms on this list, USA Rare Earth didn’t release any new information that would have caused the rise in shares. Instead, the stock seems to simply be riding the coattails of MP Materials and other rare-earth names. The company has no revenue and is working to develop a vertically integrated rare-earth supply chain in the United States. It is building a magnet production facility in Oklahoma and hopes to open a rare earth mine in Texas in several years. The company hopes to attract federal government funding for its projects, which may now be more likely given the DOD investment in MP. Ultimately, rare earths have clearly become a strategic priority for the U.S. government and huge companies like Apple. This creates a significant opportunity for the names above. However, it is important to understand that small mining stocks are notoriously risky. Projects are capitally intensive and often face long lead times and regulatory hurdles. This can lead mining companies to invest years and millions of dollars with little to show for it if things don’t go according to plan. Before you consider Critical Metals, you'll want to hear this.","If brought into production, the Brook Mine would be the only other operational rare earths mine in the U.S., besides MP’s Mountain Pass mine in California.","Since the announcement of MP’s DOD deal, Ramaco shares have been up nearly 73% as of the close of July 15.",It would also stand out from Mountain Pass in its ability to produce a large amount of more valuable heavy rare earth elements.,"The project is the first fully licensed hard-rock lithium mine in Europe, and the company hopes to begin production in 2026 or 2027."
Gene therapy maker Sarepta tells FDA it won't halt shipments despite patient deaths,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/gene-therapy-maker-sarepta-tells-fda-it-wont-halt-shipments-despite-patient-deaths-2025-07-19/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Drugmaker Sarepta Therapeutics said late Friday it won't comply with a request from the Food and Drug Administration to halt all shipments of its gene therapy following the death of a third patient receiving one of its treatments for muscular dystrophy. The highly unusual move is a latest in a string of events that have hammered the company's stock for weeks and recently forced it to lay off 500 employees. The company's decision not to comply with the FDA also places future availability of its leading therapy, called Elevidys, in doubt. The FDA said in a statement Friday night that officials met with Sarepta and requested it suspend all sales but “the company refused to do so.” The agency has the authority to pull drugs from the market, but the cumbersome regulatory process can take months or even years. Instead, the agency usually makes an informal request and companies almost always comply. “We believe in access to drugs for unmet medical needs but are not afraid to take immediate action when a serious safety signal emerges,” FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said in a statement. Elevidys is the first gene therapy approved in the U.S. for Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, the fatal muscle-wasting disease that affects males, though it has faced scrutiny since its clearance in 2023. The one-time treatment received accelerated approval against the recommendations of some FDA scientists who doubted its effectiveness. The FDA granted full approval last year and expanded the therapy’s use to patients 4 years and older, including those who can no longer walk. Previously, it was only available for younger patients who were still walking. Sarepta said Friday that its scientific review showed “no new or changed safety signals” for younger patients with Duchenne’s who have earlier stages of the disease. The company said it plans to keep the drug available for those patients. “We look forward to continued discussions and sharing of information with FDA,” the company said in a statement. Sarepta halted shipments last month of the therapy for older boys with Duchenne’s, which gradually destroys muscle and skeletal strength, resulting in early death. The move followed the deaths of two teenage boys taking the therapy. The company also confirmed a third death Friday: a 51-year-old patient who was taking an experimental gene therapy in a trial for a different form of muscular dystrophy. Sarepta said it reported the death to the FDA on June 20. The FDA said Friday it placed that trial on hold. Sarepta noted that the gene therapy involved in the incident uses “a different dose and is manufactured using a different process,” than Elevidys. All three patient deaths were linked to liver injury, a side effect noted in Sarepta's prescribing information. Earlier this week Sarepta announced it would add a bold warning to drug and lay off a third of its employees. The company did not mention the third patient death in its news release or conference call announcing those changes, sparking pointed criticism from Wall Street analysts. Company shares fell more than 35% Friday to close at $14.07. Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Sarepta has received FDA approval for three other Duchenne’s drugs since 2016, none of which have been confirmed to work. The company has long been criticized for failing to complete several studies needed to secure full FDA approval of its drugs. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

"New airport scanners are better at spotting liquid explosives, but many airports lack them",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/new-airport-scanners-are-better-at-spotting-liquid-explosives-but-many-airports-lack-them-2025-07-19/,"Travelers celebrated the suggestion that American airports might soon ease restrictions on liquids in carry-on bags that create endless hassles at security checkpoints, but more than a third of all airports around the country still haven't upgraded their screening systems to reliably detect liquid explosives that could bring down a plane. It may be annoying to have to dump water and other drinks before going through security, but the challenge is to detect the difference between things like harmless hair gel and more sinister substances. The threat nearly materialized in an attack in 2006, when authorities in the United Kingdom arrested a group that was plotting to blow holes in airliners with a homemade mixture of chemicals in sports drink bottles. Security experts remain concerned about the vulnerabilities that were exposed by that plot. Comments this week by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem got travelers excited about the prospect of one day being able to fly with more than 3 ounces of their shampoos and gels and not having to throw out the beverage they just bought. “The liquids, I’m questioning. So that may be the next big announcement, is what size your liquids need to be,” Noem said. “We have put in place in TSA a multilayered screening process that allows us to change some of how we do security and screening so it’s still as safe.” A Transportation Security Administration spokesperson said Noem and the agency “are constantly looking for ways to enhance security, and improve the travel experience for the public.” Any changes will come through the same official channels that TSA used to announce this month that travelers can keep their shoes on at checkpoints. That change offers relief from a rule adopted after “shoe bomber” Richard Reid’s failed attempt to take down a flight from Paris to Miami in late 2001 with a small explosive device hidden in his footwear. The limits on liquids were triggered by the 2006 U.K. arrests. Three ringleaders were eventually convicted. Prosecutors told the jury in that case that authorities uncovered the plot after secretly searching the luggage of a man who was on their radar for security concerns after he returned from Pakistan and found the unusual combination of the Tang powdered soft drink and a large number of batteries, according to the BBC. That triggered the surveillance operation that eventually grew to include more than 200 officers. Agents discovered what appeared to be a bomb factory in a London apartment where odd devices were being constructed out of drink bottles. The plot didn't make sense until authorities discovered that the men were researching flight timetables and realized they were only trying to make an explosive big enough to rip a hole in a plane. The meaning of coded emails to contacts in Pakistan only became clear after the arrests, when authorities realized that the quantities of Calvin Klein aftershave being discussed in messages matched the amount of hydrogen peroxide the conspirators had purchased. Ever since then, the TSA and authorities in other countries have limited carry-on liquids and gels to 3.4 ounces (100 milliliters) because officials believe that amount is too small to create an explosion capable of taking down a plane. The restriction covered all types of liquids, because X-ray machines at checkpoints couldn't differentiate between explosive and harmless ones. The United Kingdom was planning to ease its restrictions last year to allow people to carry up to 2 liters (about half a gallon) of liquid, but that was delayed because several major airports still didn't have the new scanners that use computed tomography, commonly known as a CT scan, to produce clearer images. The new machines allow screeners to switch between two-dimensional and three-dimensional images and turn them to see what may be lurking, said Johnny Jones, secretary treasurer of the chapter of the American Federation of Government Employees that represents TSA workers. “It’s just a totally life-changing situation,” said Jones, who has worked as a screener since the agency was created. “It’s a difference of being able to see something that would have been hidden by something that you can now see clear as day with the new technology. It eliminates the guesswork.” The problem is that only 255 of the 432 airports across the United States have new CT scanners installed, the interim head of the TSA told Congress this spring. The biggest airports got them first, but they are not expected to be everywhere until 2043. It's possible that a change in carry-on liquid policy could be implemented just at the biggest airports, but that could lead to confusion if travelers, are, say, allowed to bring full bottles on departure only to have them confiscated when they return. The scanners cost more than $2 million apiece, and they are so much bigger than the old X-ray machines that sometimes floors must be reinforced and checkpoints have to be redesigned. “I think you need to hold off till we get more systems deployed. I think this one’s a little too early,” said Jeff Price, who teaches aviation security at Metropolitan State University of Denver and has co-authored books on the subject. “The keep your shoes on — I can get on board with that provided we continue to do random screenings. But the liquids, I think we’re too early on that. There’s other layers of security. Yeah, I know that. But not too many of them that prevent this type of attack.” In the past the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security has highlighted vulnerabilities in TSA screening that can allow things to slip through undetected. A 2015 report found that TSA officers failed 95% of the time to detect weapons or explosive material carried by undercover inspectors. But Jones defended the work of the screeners he represents, noting that since the agency's creation, no plane has failed to reach its destination because of something that was missed. “Nothing large has been able to make it through our system since we’ve taken over screening. We've protected the skies for 22 years,” Jones said. “Even if you have a slight miss, it doesn’t necessarily mean anything is going to happen on the plane.” Before you consider Travelers Companies, you'll want to hear this.","But the liquids, I think we’re too early on that.","Travelers celebrated the suggestion that American airports might soon ease restrictions on liquids in carry-on bags that create endless hassles at security checkpoints, but more than a third of all airports around the country still haven't upgraded their screening systems to reliably detect liquid explosives that could bring down a plane.","I think this one’s a little too early,” said Jeff Price, who teaches aviation security at Metropolitan State University of Denver and has co-authored books on the subject.","“We have put in place in TSA a multilayered screening process that allows us to change some of how we do security and screening so it’s still as safe.” A Transportation Security Administration spokesperson said Noem and the agency “are constantly looking for ways to enhance security, and improve the travel experience for the public.” Any changes will come through the same official channels that TSA used to announce this month that travelers can keep their shoes on at checkpoints."
Gunmen kill 2 Indians and abduct a third in Niger,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/gunmen-kill-2-indians-and-abduct-a-third-in-niger-2025-07-19/,"NIAMEY, Niger (AP) — Gunmen killed at least two Indians and abducted a third during an attack in Niger’s southwest Dosso region, according to Indian authorities, the latest such violence targeting foreigners in Niger’s conflict-battered territories. The Indian Embassy in Niger said in a statement on X on Friday that the attack occurred on Tuesday, and that it was in touch with local authorities to repatriate the bodies of the victims and ensure the safe release of the kidnapped individual. Local media in Niger identified the victims as workers at a construction site in Dosso, located 140 kilometers (87 miles) from the country’s capital of Niamey. Foreigners are increasingly becoming targets of armed groups in Niger. Several of them have been kidnapped this year, including an Austrian woman who has lived in Niger as an aid worker for more than 20 years, a Swiss woman seized from her home in April and five Indian workers, also in April. Niger has for many years battled a jihadi insurgency linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group, a security crisis that analysts say has worsened since the military toppled the country’s government in July 2023, and has since struggled to restore peace in hot spots. According to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, June was one of the country’s deadliest months on record as IS-backed fighters launched a major offensive across the Tillaberi and Dosso regions, killing more than 100 civilians in what marked a return to mass atrocities in rural areas.","NIAMEY, Niger (AP) — Gunmen killed at least two Indians and abducted a third during an attack in Niger’s southwest Dosso region, according to Indian authorities, the latest such violence targeting foreigners in Niger’s conflict-battered territories.","The Indian Embassy in Niger said in a statement on X on Friday that the attack occurred on Tuesday, and that it was in touch with local authorities to repatriate the bodies of the victims and ensure the safe release of the kidnapped individual.","According to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, June was one of the country’s deadliest months on record as IS-backed fighters launched a major offensive across the Tillaberi and Dosso regions, killing more than 100 civilians in what marked a return to mass atrocities in rural areas.","The Indian Embassy in Niger said in a statement on X on Friday that the attack occurred on Tuesday, and that it was in touch with local authorities to repatriate the bodies of the victims and ensure the safe release of the kidnapped individual."
MarketBeat Week in Review – 07/14 - 07/18,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/marketbeat-week-in-review-07-14-07-18/,"Better-than-expected news drove the market higher this week. Inflation readings, retail sales data, unemployment claims, and consumer confidence all showed an economy that continues to outperform expectations. Investors took it from there, pushing the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ to record highs. The overall sentiment is that the economy will continue to strengthen in the year's second half. That optimism is getting support from the kickoff to earnings season. The big banks had solid reports, and names like PepsiCo Inc. NASDAQ: PEP and Netflix Inc. NASDAQ: NFLX have also set the stage for a broader rally. Next week will be light on economic data, but investors will still get the latest data on new home sales and durable goods orders. Earnings season begins to ramp up with Alphabet Inc. NASDAQ: GOOGL being one of the first big tech stocks to report. The MarketBeat analysts will be on top of the stocks and stories moving the market. Here are some of our most popular articles from this week. Articles by Thomas Hughes The artificial intelligence (AI) economy is rolling along, meaning the runway for chip stocks will be measured in years. This week, Thomas Hughes focused on two of the biggest names in this space that were making big news. Perhaps the most significant story this week was that the U.S. government has assured NVIDIA Corp. NASDAQ: NVDA it will receive a license to sell its H20 chips to China. Hughes explained why NVDA stock may be on the way to gains of 30% to 60%. Hughes also wrote about news from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. NASDAQ: AMD that reminds investors that competition to NVIDIA is coming. Hughes pointed out a technical indicator that suggests AMD stock is ready for a breakout. The bull case could be confirmed when the company reports earnings in early August. Cybersecurity is another red-hot sector for investors. This week, Hughes highlighted data from Wedbush about how AI will drive the industry's growth, as well as three cybersecurity stocks that the firm believes will lead the way. Articles by Sam Quirke Tesla Inc. NASDAQ: TSLA will report earnings next week, and Sam Quirke explained why, despite the stock’s 30% rally off its April lows, analysts remain divided. Quirke gave bulls and bears examples of how to play TSLA stock before next week’s report. Qualcomm Corp. NASDAQ: QCOM is another stock that’s made a significant move in the last quarter. However, unlike other chip stocks, Quirke pointed out that QCOM stock appears to be undervalued, which could be setting the stage for a breakout after its earnings report later this month. Sticking with the theme of stocks that are in rally mode, Quirke made a case for why Amazon.com Inc. NASDAQ: AMZN may be making a case as a forever stock. Heading into earnings, the stock is up about 30% in the last three months, and analysts believe the stock is ready to move higher. Articles by Chris Markoch Technology stocks continue to lead the market higher. That could be great news for Microsoft Corp. NASDAQ: MSFT shareholders. Chris Markoch wrote about the recent forecast from Dan Ives of Wedbush, which suggests MSFT stock could become a $600 stock in the next 12 months. Ives also continues to be bullish on Palantir Technologies Inc. NASDAQ: PLTR. The analyst raised his price target on PLTR stock to $160. Markoch explained why retail investors will continue to hold PLTR stock even if it has limited upside in the short term. Consumer staples stocks continue to underperform the market. But Markoch reminded investors there are still winners in every sector and gave them three defensive names to add this earnings season. Articles by Ryan Hasson Rocket Lab USA Inc. NASDAQ: RKLB continues to be one of the best-performing stocks of 2025. But this week, Ryan Hasson explained why recent analyst commentary suggests the stock may still offer more upside, and why the chart shows that investors looking for a better entry point should set their price targets now. Investors are looking at robotics stocks as an AI-adjacent sector that will define the future of automation. This week, Hasson highlighted five robotics stocks that combine innovation, market leadership, and long-term growth potential. Articles by Gabriel Osorio-Mazilli Investors have been piling back into technology stocks. However, Gabriel Osorio-Mazilli reminded investors that a rally could be coming in value stocks. Osorio-Mazilli highlighted three undervalued stocks that are drawing high institutional interest. Broadcom Inc. NASDAQ: AVGO may not be undervalued, but at least one investor is betting Broadcom has more room to run. Osorio-Mazilli explained why Nancy Pelosi exercising her call options on AVGO stock is a significant bet that the company's made-in-America footprint makes it a strong choice among AI stocks. Copper made news this week as the latest focus of the Trump administration's tariff plans. Osorio-Mazilli explained why Super Micro Computer Inc. NASDAQ: SMCI looks like a buying opportunity. Its liquid cooling technology will increase data center efficiency to offset higher copper prices. Articles by Leo Miller Companies buy back their stock when they believe it's undervalued. This week, Leo Miller directed investors to two companies increasing their buyback activity even though their respective stocks have outperformed the broader market. Another way that companies express belief in their stocks is through insider buying. Investors can profit from taking positions in companies showing a heavy degree of insider buying. Miller highlighted three stocks that have shown heavy insider buying in the last 60 days. An emerging theme of this quarter’s earnings may be what investors should do when good enough just isn’t good enough. This week, Miller explained how that theme played out with GE Aerospace NYSE: GE. The company had a strong earnings report, but the strong run-up in the stock prior to earnings is now creating resistance. Articles by Nathan Reiff Investors can tell risk-on sentiment is back in the market when speculative stocks are catching a bid. This week, Nathan Reiff pointed investors to three high-risk stocks that analysts believe may be setting up for explosive returns. Sticking with speculative stocks, Reiff wrote about the recent rally in Tilray Brands Inc. NASDAQ: TLRY. Investors are responding to the company’s positive cash flow, but Reiff pointed out that the cannabis sector still faces significant risks that may continue to weigh on TLRY stock. Articles by Jeffrey Neal Johnson Flying taxis or eVTOLs are becoming a reality. That means it’s time for speculative investors to decide how to invest in this sector. Jeffrey Neal Johnson pointed investors to Joby Aviation Inc. NYSE: JOBY and Archer Aviation Inc. NYSE: ACHR. These are the undisputed leaders in this emerging sector. However, the companies take two different approaches that make them very different investment opportunities. Intel Corp. NASDAQ: INTC has been a bullish but volatile stock ahead of its July 24 earnings report. Johnson explained the bullish news that triggered the rally and what investors may need to hear to send the stock higher. Renewable energy stocks have been one of the worst-performing stocks in 2025. However, Johnson explained why a loan guarantee from the U.S. Department of Energy raises the bull case for Plug Power Inc. NASDAQ: PLUG. Articles by Jordan Chussler Fund investors are frequently unaware of the risk of investing in “safe” weighted index funds. That’s why Jordan Chussler highlighted the Invesco S&P 500 Low Volatility ETF NYSEARCA: SPLV. The fund tracks the 100 lowest-volatility stocks in the S&P 500, making it a solid choice for investors looking for defensive stocks to manage market uncertainty. Articles by Brian O’Connell In the next two weeks, investors will hear from several of the Magnificent Seven stocks. However, Brian O’Connell explained why one fund manager believes investors should be selling two Mag 7 stocks and buying two other technology names. O’Connell also wrote about three restaurant stocks that are bucking the weakness in the fast food sector. Each of these stocks has at least one catalyst that analysts believe will help them overcome the headwinds in the sector. Before you consider Invesco S&P 500 Low Volatility ETF, you'll want to hear this.","Sticking with the theme of stocks that are in rally mode, Quirke made a case for why Amazon.com Inc.

The Chicago Sky are trying to protect their players on social media. Here's what that means,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/the-chicago-sky-are-trying-to-protect-their-players-on-social-media-heres-what-that-means-2025-07-19/,"INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Chicago Sky co-owner Nadia Rawlinson knew security concerns were serious. The Sky have physical security nearly 24 hours a day — around hotels, outside gyms, by buses and planes — but one of the final frontiers of player safety was the internet. Earlier this month, the Sky teamed up with Moonshot to protect their players from threats and hate on social media, the first relationship of its kind in the WNBA. “People think as athletes, we should take what comes our way,” Sky guard Ariel Atkins said. “We are human and some comments that people make are inhumane. It’s phenomenal of our organization to take care of us.” Moonshot’s technology was created for use in counterterrorism; it's used by the U.S. government. “It’s a great thing to implement right now,” said Sky All-Star Angel Reese, who has one of the most popular social media platforms among WNBA players. “It’s really important to be able to have that (protection), especially as a woman."" Moonshot monitors more than 25 social media and internet platforms, including those on which players do not have personal accounts. The technology shrinks the millions of posts it looks at every day into thousands of posts that contain direct threats to the athletes. From there, Moonshot’s team of human threat assessors, from clinical psychologists to social workers, takes over. They look through the flagged posts and report them, if necessary — whether that’s to the social media platforms themselves for removal or, in more serious and imminent cases, directly to law enforcement. They target actionable threats to the athletes, like the release of their personal information or possible stalkers. It’s that human involvement that Moonshot co-founder and CEO Vidhya Ramalingam said is necessary to its success. “This is not a problem that can just be solved by technology alone,” she said. “It’s fundamentally a human problem, and this is a human partnership.” Rawlinson, who said her own experiences as a woman of color have informed her understanding of the issue, knew it was something she wanted to focus on. “With the rise in women’s sports, the rise in attention, the greater fandom, the greater investment, all of it is historic,” Rawlinson said. “But there’s a dark side to that. At some point, you just want to play the game, so the goal is to remove some of the noise that happens off the court.” After reading about Moonshot in a tech publication a few weeks ago, Rawlinson reached out to Ramalingam about a partnership. It was a quick connection. “It was really clear there was a values alignment,” Ramalingam said. “Some of that stems from some of our shared experiences as women of color in spaces where so often our voices are underrepresented, and the desire to actually do something about it and not just sit there. “For far too long, I saw women like me, people of color, be overrepresented as targets and underrepresented in the solution,” she said. ___ This story has been corrected to show that the name of the company the Chicago Sky have partnered with is Moonshot, not Moonshot Technologies. ___ AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball","“Some of that stems from some of our shared experiences as women of color in spaces where so often our voices are underrepresented, and the desire to actually do something about it and not just sit there.","“It’s fundamentally a human problem, and this is a human partnership.” Rawlinson, who said her own experiences as a woman of color have informed her understanding of the issue, knew it was something she wanted to focus on.","“It’s a great thing to implement right now,” said Sky All-Star Angel Reese, who has one of the most popular social media platforms among WNBA players.","At some point, you just want to play the game, so the goal is to remove some of the noise that happens off the court.” After reading about Moonshot in a tech publication a few weeks ago, Rawlinson reached out to Ramalingam about a partnership."
"As the going gets tough in South Sudan, some artisans offer cheap footwear made from rubber tires",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/as-the-going-gets-tough-in-south-sudan-some-artisans-offer-cheap-footwear-made-from-rubber-tires-2025-07-18/,"WAU, South Sudan (AP) — From Rwanda to Kenya, fashioning footwear from discarded tires has long been a mark of local ingenuity. In South Sudan, however, the creative work of such artisans is now fueled by an economic crisis that has left the government on the verge of bankruptcy and many people struggling to put food on the table. As South Sudan’s oil revenues have dwindled, the government for months has been unable to pay civil servants on time. The cash crisis affects everyone from soldiers to teachers, underscoring the range of economic hardship across the country, and many are looking for ways to keep going. Some want cheap shoes, finding them not in supermarkets but in open markets where flip-flops and sandals are fashioned from worn-out tires usually thrown away as rubbish. In Wau, some 650 kilometers (400 miles) from the South Sudanese capital of Juba, shoemaker Emmanuel Achuil works under the shade of a tarpaulin in the town's bustling main market. His hands blackened from grappling with rubber, Achuil uses a blade to carve pieces from discarded tires. Colorful straps are scattered around him like pieces of a puzzle. Achuil, who makes five to 10 pairs a week, told the AP that in recent months he’s seen a rise in demand that he and others say is directly related to the rising cost of living here. They say footwear made from scraps of rubber has found a firm place in local markets, confirmed in the ubiquitous displays of such shoes even in open markets in Juba. Two years ago, Achuil was getting five to seven customers a month. Now he expects up to 20 of them, he said. Achuil’s shoes can fetch up to 15,000 South Sudanese pounds a pair, or roughly $4, depending on size and quality of finishing. In addition to their affordability, the rough-hewn pairs are praised for their durability. “Even when things get bad — no food, no jobs — this work doesn’t fail me,” Achuil said. “People always need shoes, especially cheap ones.” Akol Majok Ring, a cattle-keeper from the state of Warrap, said he discovered these sandals in March and immediately bought a pair for himself because “they are good for cattle grazing.” “When you’re moving with the cattle all day, these sandals are perfect,"" he said. “They’re durable and well-suited for the job.” The South Sudanese pound has been under pressure since 2023, losing much of its value against the dollar as oil exports are sporadically disrupted by civil war in neighboring Sudan. The economy has been in decline for five consecutive years, hampered by violence stemming mostly from the political contest between President Salva Kiir and his deputy Riek Machar, who is currently under house arrest for alleged subversion. Hyperinflation and widespread food insecurity affect nearly 80% of South Sudan's 11 million people, the same number of people living below the poverty line, according to the World Bank. South Sudan depends on oil revenues to meet 90% of the government’s annual budget, but damage earlier this year to the oil pipeline through Sudan left South Sudanese authorities briefly unable to export any crude. The government announced earlier in June that exports were due to resume after repairs to the pipeline. Many government workers are effectively without pay, and unemployment is rampant even as the prices of basic goods skyrocket. Leather shoes in the shops can seem a luxury in these circumstances. “Tire soles last longer,” said Deng Akol Athuai, who has been buying from Achuil for years. “I buy one pair, and it lasts me a year or more. They’re strong, especially for walking on rough roads.” Gabriel Bataku, a 26-year-old who is unemployed in Wau, said of artisans that they “are solving real problems. They just need recognition and support.” Achuil has been making shoes since 1996. He is not formally trained. He got his skills as a grade schooler watching older men in their workshops as they went about their business. In those days discarded tires were much easier to find, scavenged from garages or sourced through people throwing them away. But now, he said, “more people are doing this work, so the competition for materials is high.” He lamented the lack of formal support, from the government and others, that has left artisans struggling to access the tools of their trade. He wants access to better equipment. Despite the difficulties, he dreams of opening a proper workshop where he would train others. He also hopes to be able to expand his business to other towns in South Sudan. “If I had better cutting tools, and a way to expand, I could train young people,” he said. “Many are idle here in Wau. This skill could help them survive.” ___ For more on Africa and development: https://apnews.com/hub/africa-pulse The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

"Did money or politics cause Colbert cancellation? Either way, the economics are tough for TV",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/did-money-or-politics-cause-colbert-cancellation-either-way-the-economics-are-tough-for-tv-2025-07-18/,"CBS says its decision to end Stephen Colbert’s late-night comedy show is financial, not political. Yet even with the ample skepticism about that explanation, there's no denying the economics were not working in Colbert's favor. The network’s bombshell announcement late Thursday that the “Late Show” will end next May takes away President Donald Trump’s most prominent TV critic and the most popular entertainment program in its genre. The television industry's declining economic health means similar hard calls are already being made with personalities and programming, with others to be faced in the future. For the late-night genre, there are unique factors to consider. As recently as 2018, broadcast networks took in an estimated $439 million in advertising revenue for its late-night programs, according to the advertising firm Guidelines. Last year, that number dwindled to $220 million. Late-night TV was a particular draw for young men, considered the hardest-to-get and most valuable demographic for advertisers. Increasingly, these viewers are turning to streaming services, either to watch something else entirely or catch highlights of the late-night shows, which are more difficult for the networks to monetize. More broadly, the much-predicted takeover of viewers by streaming services is coming to pass. The Nielsen company reported that during the last two months, for the first time ever, more people consumed programming on services like YouTube and Netflix than on ABC, CBS and NBC or any cable network. Networks and streamers spent roughly $70 billion on entertainment shows and $30 billion for sports rights last year, said Brian Wieser, CEO of Madison & Wall, an advertising consultant and data services firm. Live sports is the most dependable magnet for viewers and costs for its rights are expected to increase 8% a year over the next decade. With television viewership declining in general, it's clear where savings will have to come from. Wieser said he does not know whether Colbert's show is profitable or not for CBS and parent company Paramount Global, but he knows the direction in which it is headed. “The economics of television are weak,” he said. In a statement announcing the cancellation, George Cheeks, Paramount Global's president and chief executive officer, said that “This is purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night. It is not related in any way to the show’s performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.” Cheeks' problem is that not everyone believes him. Colbert is a relentless critic of Trump, and earlier this week pointedly criticized Paramount's decision to settle Trump's lawsuit against CBS over a “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris. He called Paramount's $16 million payment to Trump a “big fat bribe,” since the company is seeking the administration's approval of its merger with Skydance Media. On Friday, the Writers Guild of America called for an investigation by New York's attorney general into whether Colbert's cancellation is itself a bribe, “sacrificing free speech to curry favor with the Trump administration as the company looks for merger approval.” CBS' decision made this a pivotal week for the future of television and radio programming. Congress stripped federal funding for PBS and NPR, threatening the future of shows on those outlets. Journey Gunderson, executive director of the National Comedy Center, called the decision to end Colbert's show the end of an era. “Late-night television has historically been one of comedy's most audience-accessible platforms — a place where commentary meets community, night after night,” Gunderson said. “This isn't just the end of a show. It's the quiet removal of one of the few remaining platforms for daily comedic commentary. Trump, who has called in the past for CBS to terminate Colbert's contract, celebrated the show's upcoming demise. “I absolutely love that Colbert got fired,” the president wrote on Truth Social. “His talent was even less than his ratings.” Some experts questioned whether CBS could have explored other ways to save money on Colbert. NBC, for example, has cut costs by eliminating the band on Seth Meyers' late-night show and curtailing Jimmy Fallon's “Tonight” show to four nights a week. Could CBS have saved more money by cutting off the show immediately, instead of letting it run until next May, which sets up an awkward “lame duck” period? Then again, Colbert will keep working until his contract runs out; CBS would have had to keep paying him anyway. CBS recently cancelled the “After Midnight” show that ran after Colbert. But the network had signaled earlier this year that it was prepared to continue that show until host Taylor Tomlinson decided that she wanted to leave, noted Bill Carter, author of “The Late Shift.” “It is a very sad day for CBS that they are getting out of the late-night race,” Andy Cohen, host of Bravo's “Watch What Happens Live,"" told The Associated Press. “I mean, they are turning off the lights after the news.” Colbert, if he wanted to continue past next May, would likely be able to find a streaming service willing to pay him, Wieser said. But the future of late-night comedy on the entertainment networks is genuinely at risk. Trump, in fact, may outlast his fiercest comic critics. Jon Stewart, once a weeknight fixture, works one night a week at “The Daily Show” for Paramount's Comedy Central, a network that seldom produces much original programming any more. ABC's Jimmy Kimmel, who was chided on social media by Trump on Friday — “I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next” — has a contract that also runs out next year. Kimmel, 57, openly wondered in a Variety interview before signing his latest three-year contract extension how long he wanted to do it. He's hosted his show since 2003. “I have moments where I go, I cannot do this anymore,” Kimmel told Variety in 2022. “And I have moments where I go, what am I gonna do with my life if I'm not doing this anymore?' It's a very complicated thing ... I'm not going to do this forever.” Colbert, Kimmel and Stewart were all nominated for Emmy awards this week. ___ AP journalist Liam McEwan in Los Angeles contributed to this report.

"Lawyer argues Call of Duty maker can't be held responsible for actions of Uvalde, Texas, shooter",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/lawyer-argues-call-of-duty-maker-cant-be-held-responsible-for-actions-of-uvalde-texas-shooter-2025-07-18/,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — A lawyer for the maker of the video game Call of Duty argued Friday that a judge should dismiss a lawsuit brought by families of the victims of the Robb Elementary School attack in Uvalde, Texas, saying the contents of the war game are protected by the First Amendment. The families sued Call of Duty maker Activision and Meta Platforms, which owns Instagram, saying that the companies bear responsibility for promoting products used by the teen gunman. Three sets of parents who lost children in the shooting were in the audience at the Los Angeles hearing. Activision lawyer Bethany Kristovich told Superior Court Judge William Highberger that the “First Amendment bars their claims, period full stop.” “The issues of gun violence are incredibly difficult,” Kristovich said. “The evidence in this case is not.” She argued that the case has little chance of prevailing if it continues, because courts have repeatedly held that “creators of artistic works, whether they be books, music, movies, TV or video games, cannot be held legally liable for the acts of their audience.” The lawsuit, one of many involving Uvalde families, was filed last year on the second anniversary of one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history. The gunman killed 19 students and two teachers. Officers finally confronted and shot him after waiting more than an hour to enter the fourth-grade classroom. Kimberly Rubio, whose 10-year-old daughter Lexi was killed in the shooting, was among the parents who came from Texas to Southern California, where Activision is based, for the hearing. “We traveled all this way, so we need answers,” Rubio said outside the courthouse. ""It's our hope that the case will move forward so we can get those answers."" An attorney for the families argued during the hearing that Call of Duty exceeds its First Amendment protections by moving into marketing. “The basis of our complaint is not the existence of Call of Duty,"" Katie Mesner-Hage told the judge. ""It is using Call of Duty as a platform to market weapons to minors.” The plaintiffs' lawyers showed contracts and correspondence between executives at Activison and gunmakers whose products, they said, are clearly and exactly depicted in the game despite brand names not appearing. Mesner-Hage said the documents show that they actually prefer being unlabeled because “it helps shield them from the implication that they are marketing guns to minors,” while knowing that players will still identify and seek out the weapons. Kristovich said there is no evidence that the kind of product placement and marketing the plaintiffs are talking about happened in any of the editions of the game the shooter played. The families have also filed a lawsuit against Daniel Defense, which manufactured the AR-style rifle used in the May 24, 2022, shooting. Koskoff argued that a replica of the rifle clearly appears on a splash page for Call of Duty. Josh Koskoff, the families' Connecticut-based lead attorney, also represented families of nine Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims in a lawsuit against gunmaker Remington and got a $73 million lawsuit settlement. He invoked Sandy Hook several times in his arguments, saying the shooters there and in Uvalde shared the same gaming obsession. Koskoff said the Uvalde shooter experienced “the absorption and the loss of self in Call of Duty.” He said that immersion was so deep that the shooter searched online for how to obtain an armored suit that he didn't know only exists in the game. Koskoff played a clip from Call of Duty Modern Warfare, the game the shooter played, with a first-person shooter gunning down opponents. The shots echoed loudly in the courtroom, and several people in the audience slowly shook their heads. “Call of Duty is in a class of its own,"" Koskoff said. Kristovich argued for Activision that the game, despite its vast numbers of players, can be tied to only a few of the many U.S. mass shootings. “The game is incredibly common. It appears in a scene on ‘The Office,’"" she said. She added that it is ridiculous to assert that “this is such a horrible scourge that your honor has to essentially ban it through this lawsuit.” Highberger told the lawyers he was not leaning in either direction before the hearing. He gave no time frame for when he will rule, but a quick decision is not expected. The judge did tell the plaintiffs' lawyers that their description of Activision's actions seemed like deliberate malfeasance, where their lawsuit alleges negligence. He said that was the biggest hurdle they needed to clear. “Their conduct created a risk of exactly what happened,” Mesner-Hage told him. “And we represent the people who are exactly the foreseeable victims of that conduct.” Meta's attorneys will make arguments on a similar motion next month.","LOS ANGELES (AP) — A lawyer for the maker of the video game Call of Duty argued Friday that a judge should dismiss a lawsuit brought by families of the victims of the Robb Elementary School attack in Uvalde, Texas, saying the contents of the war game are protected by the First Amendment.","LOS ANGELES (AP) — A lawyer for the maker of the video game Call of Duty argued Friday that a judge should dismiss a lawsuit brought by families of the victims of the Robb Elementary School attack in Uvalde, Texas, saying the contents of the war game are protected by the First Amendment.",Officers finally confronted and shot him after waiting more than an hour to enter the fourth-grade classroom.,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — A lawyer for the maker of the video game Call of Duty argued Friday that a judge should dismiss a lawsuit brought by families of the victims of the Robb Elementary School attack in Uvalde, Texas, saying the contents of the war game are protected by the First Amendment."
