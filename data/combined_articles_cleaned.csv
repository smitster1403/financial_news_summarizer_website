"ABB India shares 6 percent lower on muted outlook for large orders, forex volatility",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/abb-india-shares-6-percent-lower-on-muted-outlook-for-large-orders-forex-volatility-13381294.html,"Power equipment manufacturer ABB India's shares are sharply lower by up to 6 percent on August 4 after the company shared a muted outlook on large orders, and said tariff-related uncertainty is weighing on private capex. The company said its large orders were impacted by 'subdued market conditions', and the base order segment grew by 5 percent on year, during the June quarter. The company reported a 20 percent fall in June quarter net profit at Rs 352 crore on forex volatility and expenses, and a revenue of Rs 3,175 crore compared to Rs 2,831 crore a year ago. The profitability was 'tempered' by forex volatility and on-offs, the company said. ""While profitability was impacted by forex volatility and one-offs during the quarter, we continued to deliver double-digit PAT margins for the 11th consecutive quarter. Cash position of the company remains healthy due to consistent efforts in collection,"" Sanjeev Sharma, Country Head and Managing Director, ABB India said after the earnings. ABB India's cash position was robust at Rs 5,154 crore at the end of the June quarter. The management said it is hopeful of regaining its growth trajectory in the second half of the year, as large order flow comes back on track. In segments such as data Centre, renewable power, infrastructure, the pipeline of orders is looking promising, ABB India said during the investor concall on August 4. ABB India added pharma and healthcare as the theme for the quarter and said companies in this space are adopting advanced technologies and improving their efficiency, which is adding to the orderbook. India has the largest number of USFDA-compliant pharmaceutical plants outside the US, and over 2,000 WHO-GMP approved facilities, ABB India added. This segment, ABB India said, is expected to continue its growth trajectory. On tariffs, ABB India said it 'does not see significant impact' at this point of time, and is expanding its base in India with energy efficient solutions across segments. Only 10 percent of revenue contribution is coming from exports, with only a minor part exposed to the American market, said ABB India. The environment of uncertainty is weighing down on the private capex, and while the government capex has started picking up but is yet to gather pace, ABB India added.","The company said its large orders were impacted by 'subdued market conditions', and the base order segment grew by 5 percent on year, during the June quarter.","The company reported a 20 percent fall in June quarter net profit at Rs 352 crore on forex volatility and expenses, and a revenue of Rs 3,175 crore compared to Rs 2,831 crore a year ago.","This segment, ABB India said, is expected to continue its growth trajectory.","ABB India added pharma and healthcare as the theme for the quarter and said companies in this space are adopting advanced technologies and improving their efficiency, which is adding to the orderbook."

Strong demand momentum continues, backed by sustained public and private sector capex across key industries. The company is witnessing strong order inquiries from high-growth segments such as data centers, steel, cement, oil & gas, and green energy. To capitalize on this, the company’s 6,000 MVA capacity expansion remains on track and is expected to be fully operational by Q1FY27. This positions Voltamp well to serve the growing demand for power transformers, particularly in the class of up to 220kV, which constitutes 80–85% of total power transformer demand. Outlook However, rising competitive intensity and increased capacity additions are expected to lead to margin normalization going forward.

The sharp rise in the share price rippled down to the other capital market stocks as well, pushing the sectoral index higher nearly 2 percent. The Nifty Capital Markets index hit an intraday high of nearly 4,380 in the morning. MCX led the gains, while CDSL, Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC, CAMS and Anand Rathi Wealth Management shares followed, rising up to 3 percent. MCX on August 1 reported a net profit of Rs 203 crore for the April-June quarter of the financial year 2026. This marks a 83 percent on-year jump from the Rs 111 crore net profit reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year. The firm’s revenue from operations meanwhile grew 59 percent on-year to Rs 373 crore in Q1 FY26. It had earlier reported revenue from operations at Rs 234 crore in Q1 FY25. EBITDA meanwhile increased to Rs 274 crore during the quarter under review. Along with the Q1 results, MCX also announced a stock split in the ratio of 1:5 for its eligible shareholders. This means that every single share owned by the shareholder as on the record date will be split into 5 equity shares. The company said that the move was aimed at enhancing stock affordability, making it more accessible to retail investors. ""To enhance stock affordability, making it more accessible to retail investors, MCX Board approved stock split of 1:5 ratio, i.e. face value of Rs. 10 per share reduced to Rs. 2 per share fully paid up, subject to statutory and regulatory approvals as applicable, and approval of shareholders of the company,"" the firm said. Morgan Stanley however kept an ‘underweight’ call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 5,750 per share. This implies a downside potential of more than 24 percent from the stock’s previous closing price of Rs 7,594 apiece. The international brokerage said that while the firm’s Q1 profit after tax beat estimates by 4 percent, it remains cautious due to the stock’s high valuation and revenue concentration. MCX shares are currently trading at Rs 7,994.50 apiece on NSE. The stock has lost nearly 10 percent in the past one month, but gained more than 36 percent in the past six months.

The Specialty Chemicals segment registered 11% YoY growth, driven by strong performance in Fine Chemicals and CDMO. The Pharma side witnessed stable demand and pricing, while the Agrochemical portfolio showed signs of modest recovery during the quarter. Improved product mix within the high-margin Specialty segment led to a 720bps YoY expansion in EBITDAM. Deliveries under the $300mn agrochemical CDMO contract are expected to commence by early CY26. The Nutrition segment saw a 4% YoY revenue decline, along with a 130bps sequential drop in margins, primarily due to lower volumes and modest correction in niacinamide prices. Meanwhile, the Chemical Intermediates segment experienced a gradual sequential recovery, led by volume growth, although pricing remains under pressure. Looking ahead, we expect the Specialty segment to remain the key growth driver. Outlook However, pricing headwinds in the Nutrition and Chemical Intermediates segments continue to pose challenges. At an implied valuation of 37x FY27 EPS, we maintain “HOLD,” with a target price of Rs743, based on a sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) valuation approach.

Summer-centric portfolio (Real, and Glucose) dragged growth given weather anomalies whereas Gulabari, Chyawanprash, Honitus, Hajmola delivered double-digit growth. Dabur is looking at corrective steps in Beverages, introducing modern format products in healthcare and innovations in Digestives. However, we believe that the recovery would be gradual given heightened competitive intensity in some of these segments. We expect strong growth in 2Q/3Q on a low base and expected improvement in urban demand even as rural demand recovery is on course. Debur is experiencing 7-8% input cost inflation and would need to take price increases to ward off the impact, which can impact volumes to some extent. We estimate 9.4% Sales CAGR & 9.3% PAT CAGR over FY25-27 on a low base (affected by slowdown and inventory destocking). Outlook Dabur currently trades at 43.4xJuneFY27 EPS, which leaves little room for significant re-rating. However, given low base and expected demand recovery, retain Hold with a target price of Rs524 (43xJune27 EPS).

And 4) little visibility on D-Mart Ready's path to profitability (FY25 margins declined 120bps with 34% higher losses at Rs2.48bn). D’Mart has incurred a capex of Rs33bn in FY25 (Rs13bn in FY20), and we expect a capex of Rs50bn in FY29. We note that margin erosion and mix change have resulted in deterioration in ROE from 18% to 14% and cash surplus has also come down to ~Rs9bn (Rs40bn raised in QIP in Feb20). We expect ROE to decline to 12.5% over next 2 years (assuming debt funding of capex, higher decline with fund raises). Outlook Although growth rate over next couple of years is expected to be higher than past 2 years, accelerated capex and gradual decline in ROE will prevent any major rerating from current valuations of 78.7xJune27 EPS.

Although the summer portfolio may face headwinds in 2Q also, it will be partially neutralized by gains in pain management.

The revenue growth was primarily driven by PV (+3.3% QoQ), while the CV segment (down 2.8% QoQ) saw a ramp down in one of the key accounts. The other element to the slowdown is the re-prioritization or cannibalization of revenues from futuristic product investments to fixing the existing products and features (smart Cockpit and Autonomous). Although the TCV bookings plummeted sequentially, the deal pipeline and OEMs conversations remain healthy, which drives management confidence to have better H2 over H1. Additionally, the company’s early efforts to penetrate Chinese market have started reaping benefits in terms of engaging with Tier-1 suppliers and few OEMs, where it deploys products and accelerators over core services. We believe the healthy execution along with a notable deal pipeline on the PV side should continue its momentum and support revenue growth in H2. Outlook We are adjusting FY26 inorganic revenue contribution due to deferment of the integration timeline of Caresoft and baking CC revenue growth of 6%/14% YoY for FY26E/FY27E, while keeping our margins unchanged. We are assigning 35x PE to FY27E, translating a TP of 1,390. Maintain “ACCUMULATE”.

TSI EBITDA grew 5% YoY despite 4% decline in volumes as higher steel prices supported blended NSR. TSE delivered better operating performance supported by narrowing of TSUK losses and improvement in TSN EBITDA/t on higher pricing. Going forward, monsoon led pricing weakness at TSI is expected to impact Q2, while TSE performance would be relatively stable aided by lower RM prices. Although TSUK breakeven may be delayed due to weak EU market conditions worsened by ongoing tariff uncertainties, mgmt.’s Rs115bn cost transformation initiatives are expected to aid FY26 EBIDTA (achieved Rs29bn in Q1). Key variables to watch out for in H2FY26 are: demand improvement and extension and/ or increase of safeguard duty. Outlook We expect EBITDA CAGR of 33% over FY25-27E on the back of KPO volume ramp-up, expected domestic pricing recovery and TSE turnaround. At CMP, the stock is trading at 7.8x/5.8x EV of FY26/27E EBITDA. We maintain ‘Accumulate’ rating with revised TP of Rs177 (earlier Rs171) valuing at 6.5x EV of Mar’27E TSI EBITDA.

"Tata Steel shares surge 2%, emerges top Nifty gainer on strong Q1 results",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/tata-steel-shares-surge-2-emerges-top-nifty-gainer-on-strong-q1-results-13380378.html,"Shares of Tata Steel rose 2 percent to Rs 156 per share on August 4, becoming the top gainer on the Nifty 50 index. The stock moved up after the company reported strong earnings for the April–June quarter (Q1FY26), aided by the Centre’s safeguard duty on certain imported steel products. So far this year, Tata Steel shares have declined 3 percent, underperforming the Nifty 50 index which has gained 3 percent over the same period. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog For the quarter, Tata Steel reported a 116.5 percent year-on-year jump in consolidated net profit to Rs 2,077.7 crore, compared to Rs 959.6 crore a year ago. The growth was driven by higher net realisations and planned cost-saving measures. Consolidated revenue, however, fell 2.9 percent year-on-year to Rs 53,178.1 crore. Despite the decline, both profit and revenue were above estimates of Rs 1,786 crore and Rs 51,409 crore, respectively. Sequentially, profit was up nearly 60 percent while revenue dropped 5.4 percent. Jefferies maintained a “buy” rating on the stock, with a target price of Rs 200 per share. The brokerage noted that Q1 EBITDA rose 11 percent year-on-year and came in 4 percent above their expectations. EBITDA per tonne improved in both India and the Netherlands, while losses narrowed in the UK. Jefferies expects India margins to come under some pressure in Q2 as spot steel prices are currently 4 percent below the Q1 average. However, they also pointed to signs of recovery, with China’s export hot-rolled coil prices rising 6 percent over the past month. They forecasted a healthy 8 percent compound annual growth in India volumes. In India, production and deliveries were slightly lower due to maintenance shutdowns at the Jamshedpur and Neelachal Ispat Nigam plants. The company expects operations to normalise in upcoming quarters. In the UK, Tata Steel’s revenue stood at 536 million pounds, while EBITDA loss narrowed to 41 million pounds from 80 million pounds in Q4FY25. Deliveries were slightly lower at 0.60 million tonnes amid soft demand. Netherlands operations reported revenue of 1,519 million euros and EBITDA of 64 million euros, significantly higher than the 14 million euros EBITDA posted in Q4FY25. Liquid steel production was 1.70 million tonnes and deliveries were 1.50 million tonnes.

The shares of the logistics company hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs 452.55 apiece. Delivery on August 1 reported a net profit of Rs 91 crore for Q1 of the ongoing financial year 2025-2026. This marks a 67 percent on-year jump from the Rs 54 crore net profit reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year. The Gurugram-based firm's revenue from operations meanwhile grew 6 percent on-year to Rs 2,294 crore during the quarter under review. EBITDA meanwhile improved 53 percent on-year to Rs 149 crore. Delhivery also announced that it has completed its acquisition of rival Ecom Express for up to Rs 1,407 crore. The acquisition closed on July 18, the publicly listed company confirmed in a letter to shareholders while announcing its June quarter earnings. ""The financials are being consolidated from the date of the closing of the acquisition,"" Delhivery said, clarifying that the first-quarter results do not reflect Ecom Express' impact. However, integration is already underway and is expected to be completed over a six-month period. Should you buy, sell or hold? Brokerages issued positive notes for the stock after the release of the results. Motilal Oswal maintained its 'Buy' rating on the stock, but increased its target price to Rs 500 apiece. This implies an upside potential of more than 16 percent over the firm's previous closing price of Rs 430 apiece. The domestic brokerage said, ""Delhivery delivered a strong 1QFY26 performance despite seasonal weakness, with robust volume growth in Express Parcel (+14% YoY) and PTL (+15% YoY) and improved service EBITDA margins. New services such as Delhivery Direct and Rapid are scaling up, while the Ecom Express acquisition is set to boost network synergies and lower capex intensity. With improvement in service EBITDA margins and an improved outlook, we raise our EBITDA estimates for FY26/FY27/FY28 by 19%/12%/5% and expect Delhivery to report a CAGR of 14%/38%/53% in sales/EBITDA/APAT over FY25-28E."" Kotak Institutional Equities also kept a ‘Buy’ call on the shares of Delhivery, with a target price of Rs 500 per share. This implies an upside potential of over 16 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. The domestic brokerage said that the firm’s Q1 profit before tax jumped 77 percent quarter-on-quarter despite operational disturbances. This demonstrates the resilience of its business model. Rejig in portfolio reflects confidence in supply chain expansion and new initiatives, it added. Goldman Sachs however had a ‘neutral’ call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 375 per share. This implies a downside potential of nearly 13 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. The international brokerage noted that e-commerce grew at 14 percent, while revenue rose only 10 percent. This indicates lower realisations. The firm’s adjusted EBITDA margin of 3.3 percent was also below estimates, Goldman added, while noting that the strong PAT came on account of treasury gains. Delhivery shares have gained more than 15 percent in the past one month, and over 37 percent in the past six months. The stock has so far gained nearly 30 percent in 2025. It currently has a P/E ratio of nearly 162. Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

"Aster DM-QCIL merger may complete by Q4FY26, synergies to add 10-15% to EBITDA over two years: Alisha Moopen",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/aster-dm-qcil-merger-on-track-ebitda-growth-over-from-synergies-says-alisha-moopen-13380280.html,"Healthcare service provider Aster DM Healthcare is targetting pan-India as well as micro market leadership, with an eye on ‘top one or top two’ positions in cities where it operates, and said the merger with Blackstone-controlled Quality Care India (QCIL) is moving into its final stages. The company has a clear timeline and synergy targets for the integration, with approvals from the Competition Commission of India (CCI) in place and a share swap arrangement completed, the final step is a nod from the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), which is expected by the fourth quarter of FY26. The merger is set to create one of India's largest healthcare networks, positioning the combined entity as a formidable player. ""The goal is micro market leadership,"" Alisha Moopen, Deputy Managing Director of Aster DM Healthcare said in a recent interview. ""We do believe that over the course of the next five to 10 years, becoming a Pan-India leader makes sense for us"". The combined platform will boast a significant footprint of over 10,350 beds across 38 hospitals in 27 Indian cities. The scale of the new entity is reflected in the strong financials for the June quarter of the fiscal year 2026. The merged enterprise reported revenue of Rs 2,157 crore and an operating EBITDA of Rs 442 crore for the quarter, with a robust EBITDA margin and a Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) both above 20%. Post-merger, Aster anticipates a 10-15% improvement in EBITDA over two years, fuelled by synergies in procurement and operational efficiencies. ""Once we are able to kind of consolidate the purchases and stuff, we should be able to see a 10-15% improvement on our margins,"" Moopen said, highlighting benefits from consolidating the procurement of capital equipment, operational expenses, and technology investments. This is expected to lift the operating margin to a target of ""22, 23%,"" up from the current 20%, she said. The strategic rationale for the merger is rooted in its complementary nature. ""One of the beauties of the merger that we've got is, at least from a geographic perspective, it was very complementary,"" Moopen said, highlighting there are no geographic overlaps between the two entities. This allows the new company to focus on leveraging scale to attract top clinical talent and consolidate its presence in South and Central India. While awaiting final merger approvals, Aster is not standing still. The company recently announced a Rs 580 crore investment for a new 500-bed hospital in Yeshwanthpur, Bengaluru, its fifth in the city. This expansion is part of a broader plan to add approximately 4,000 beds across the combined network over the next three years, in order to cement its leadership in key markets. Moopen emphasized that the merger is a significant accelerator for Aster's growth ambitions. ""On our own, those 5000 beds of ours to taking it to 10,000 beds would have taken us like more than 20 years,"" she said. ""If you are able to find complementary sort of assets where values are aligned, it may, you know, so that was the case with quality care."" Aster DM Healthcare and Blackstone-owned hospital platform Quality Care India (QCIL) had in November last year announced a merger, with the new entity to be named Aster DM Quality Care, valued at over Rs 42,000 crore. Blackstone will be the largest shareholder in the merged entity with about 30.7% stake, Aster promoters will have around 24% and TPG which was an earlier investor in QCIL will hold 10.22% and the rest will be held by public and other shareholders. Prior to the deal with QCIL, Aster separated its Gulf business, and sold 65% stake to Fajr Capital-led consortium.","Aster DM Healthcare and Blackstone-owned hospital platform Quality Care India (QCIL) had in November last year announced a merger, with the new entity to be named Aster DM Quality Care, valued at over Rs 42,000 crore.","Healthcare service provider Aster DM Healthcare is targetting pan-India as well as micro market leadership, with an eye on ‘top one or top two’ positions in cities where it operates, and said the merger with Blackstone-controlled Quality Care India (QCIL) is moving into its final stages.","""The goal is micro market leadership,"" Alisha Moopen, Deputy Managing Director of Aster DM Healthcare said in a recent interview.","The company has a clear timeline and synergy targets for the integration, with approvals from the Competition Commission of India (CCI) in place and a share swap arrangement completed, the final step is a nod from the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), which is expected by the fourth quarter of FY26."
Radico Khaitan Q1 FY26: Record-breaking volumes,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/moneycontrol-research/radico-khaitan-q1-fy26-record-breaking-volumes-13380294.html,"Highlights:Premium segment grew over 40% in Q1FY26New liquor policy in AP fuels popular segment volumesTapping luxury and super luxury segments through new product launchesImproved grain supplies to aid margins in the near termStock is trading close to all-time highsLiquor manufacturer Radico Khaitan posted its best-ever quarterly sales of Rs 1,506 crore in the period ending June 2025, increasing 33 percent year on year (YoY), driven by a phenomenal 37 percent jump in sales volumes. Sustained positive momentum The ""Prestige & Above"" premium segment was once again a standout performer for Radico Khaitan, witnessing an impressive 41 percent YoY jump in volume to 3.8 million cases. Its value growth was even stronger at 43 percent YoY, thanks to the expansion in distribution of premium and luxury offerings. Continuing its momentum from the second half of last year, the regular segment gained further strength with volumes soaring 52 percent YoY to 5.4 million cases. The rise can be attributed to a favourable base, the resolution of most state-level industry problems, and recent adjustments in Andhra Pradesh's liquor licensing policy. The de-control of liquor retail business in Andhra Pradesh from October 12, 2024, has led to a considerable market share increase for Radico Khaitan in the region. Revenues from the non-IMFL segment grew a healthy 12 percent YoY to Rs 436 crore, primarily driven by strong bulk alcohol sales. The management anticipates that non-IMFL revenues will remain stable at current levels in the upcoming quarters, as the Sitapur plant is operating near its full capacity. Gross margins for the quarter expanded by ~ 200 bps YoY to 43 percent, benefiting from stabilised raw material prices and continued premiumisation efforts in the IMFL sector. Product mix changes caused a sequential drop of 50 bps QoQ. Despite a substantial 48 percent YoY increase in selling and distribution expenses, EBITDA jumped 56 percent YoY to reach Rs 231 crore. Expanding into luxury, super luxury With a 9 percent YoY growth, Radico Khaitan's total IMFL volume hit 31.4 million cases in FY25. Magic Moments Vodka, the flagship brand with a 60 percent share of the total vodka market, continued its strong performance, exceeding 7 million cases. Morpheus Super Premium Brandy achieved 1.2 million cases, and After Dark Blue Whisky reached 1.9 million cases. The company is actively pursuing market expansion by establishing strategic collaborations in sports, fashion, music, and luxury sectors, and by filling product gaps with new competitive offerings, including the recent launch of The Spirit of Kashmyr, a luxury vodka. Besides, the company is broadening the distribution of existing brands, such as Royal Ranthambore Heritage Collection Whisky, through CSDs (Canteen Store Departments) in Q4 FY25. Looking ahead, Radico's management plans to invest 6-8 percent of IMFL revenues in advertising and promotion for both established and new brands to boost sales. Receding cost pressures Radico's gross margins faced pressure in H1 FY25 due to elevated foodgrain inflation and glass prices. However, the company is now benefiting from moderating input costs, driven by a Rs 550 per quintal reduction in FCI (Food Corporation of India) price reserve prices (Rs 2,250 for states and ethanol producers) and a 3-4 percent decrease in glass prices over the past year. More importantly, grain prices are expected to remain stable due to the early arrival of monsoon. Consequently, these raw material cost savings are anticipated to aid Radico Khaitan's gross margins. Additionally, the use of captive ENA (extra neutral alcohol) from the Sitapur unit offers further scope for margin expansion, with the management targeting a 16-17 percent operating margin range for the medium term. As of June 2025, Radico's net debt stood at Rs 410 crore, representing a decrease of Rs 163 crore from the previous quarter, primarily due to the receipt of overdue payments. The company anticipates that robust cash flows will aid further debt reduction throughout 2025 and 2026. For FY26, Radico targets a net debt reduction of Rs 150-200 crore, with a medium-term objective of becoming debt-free within 24 to 30 months. Outlook and recommendation Radico’s Q1 FY26 results reinforces its position as a top-tier growth stock in the Indian consumer universe. Over the medium term, Radico’s management is targeting a 14–15 percent growth rate due to the strong anticipated growth of the Indian alcohol beverage market, fuelled by changing consumer lifestyles and higher disposable incomes. However, the stock's current valuation of 65 times estimated FY27 earnings seems to reflect all future positives, suggesting limited room for capital appreciation over the next 2-3 years.","Revenues from the non-IMFL segment grew a healthy 12 percent YoY to Rs 436 crore, primarily driven by strong bulk alcohol sales.","Highlights:Premium segment grew over 40% in Q1FY26New liquor policy in AP fuels popular segment volumesTapping luxury and super luxury segments through new product launchesImproved grain supplies to aid margins in the near termStock is trading close to all-time highsLiquor manufacturer Radico Khaitan posted its best-ever quarterly sales of Rs 1,506 crore in the period ending June 2025, increasing 33 percent year on year (YoY), driven by a phenomenal 37 percent jump in sales volumes.","Sustained positive momentum The ""Prestige & Above"" premium segment was once again a standout performer for Radico Khaitan, witnessing an impressive 41 percent YoY jump in volume to 3.8 million cases.","Highlights:Premium segment grew over 40% in Q1FY26New liquor policy in AP fuels popular segment volumesTapping luxury and super luxury segments through new product launchesImproved grain supplies to aid margins in the near termStock is trading close to all-time highsLiquor manufacturer Radico Khaitan posted its best-ever quarterly sales of Rs 1,506 crore in the period ending June 2025, increasing 33 percent year on year (YoY), driven by a phenomenal 37 percent jump in sales volumes."

"Federal Bank shares tumble 5% as Q1 profit dips: Should you buy, sell, or hold?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/federal-bank-shares-in-focus-as-q1-profit-dips-should-you-buy-sell-or-hold-13379420.html,"Shares of Federal Bank tumbled as much as 5 percent to Rs 185 per share on August 4 as the lender posted a drop in quarterly profit, hit by higher provisions, a sharp jump in credit costs, and a rise in bad loans compared to the previous quarter. Still, many brokerages remain positive on the stock, as the bank’s management expects the stress in the microfinance book and credit costs to ease after the second quarter. Nuvama Institutional Equities maintained a “buy” rating on the stock, with a target price of Rs 230 per share. According to them, the June quarter was soft, net interest margins fell by 18 basis points quarter-on-quarter, slippages increased by 34 percent, and credit costs jumped 66 basis points. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog Most of the slippages were from the agriculture loan book, which rose to Rs 270 crore from Rs 71 crore in March. Business banking slippages also rose 24 percent sequentially to Rs 77 crore. The bank’s management said that May saw the peak stress in the microfinance portfolio, and things have been improving since then. Due to this stress, credit costs increased by 38 basis points from the previous quarter to 65 basis points. The management, however, expects this to reduce and end the year at 55 basis points. CLSA analysts also maintained an “outperform” rating, with a target price of Rs 230. They said that while margins did contract, they still fared better than peers. Strong other income and lower operating expenses helped support profitability, they added. On the other hand, Morgan Stanley analysts were cautious. They gave the stock an “underweight” rating with a target price of Rs 165 per share. They expect the bank’s return on assets to moderate to 1 percent in FY26, given the rise in bad loans and credit costs from microfinance stress. For the June quarter, Federal Bank’s net profit dropped 14.6 percent to Rs 861.8 crore. Provisions surged 177 percent, mainly due to agri and microfinance loans. Net interest income rose 2 percent year-on-year to Rs 2,336.8 crore. There was also an improvement in asset quality. The gross non-performing asset (NPA) ratio improved to 1.91 percent from 2.11 percent, and the net NPA ratio declined to 0.48 percent from 0.60 percent.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Star Cement, Fortis Healthcare, Vimta Labs, Hitachi Energy, Metropolis Healthcare and others on August 4?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-star-cement-fortis-healthcare-vimta-labs-hitachi-energy-metropolis-healthcare-and-others-on-august-4-13378854.html,"Equity benchmarks extended their downward trajectory for another session, with the Nifty 50 falling by 0.8% on August 1. Bears maintained control over market breadth, as 2,035 shares declined compared to 632 advancing shares on the NSE. While the market may rebound following last week’s sell-off, the key factor to watch is sustainability. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Rajesh Palviya, Senior Vice President Research (Head Technical Derivatives) at Axis Securities Star Cement | CMP: Rs 243.85 On the weekly chart, Star Cement has decisively surpassed the five-month multiple resistance zone at Rs 236 on a closing basis. The past couple of weeks have witnessed rising volumes, signifying increased participation. The weekly Bollinger Bands buy signal indicates growing momentum. The stock is trading well above its 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-day SMAs, reinforcing the bullish trend. These averages are also gradually rising alongside the price, supporting bullish sentiment. The daily, weekly, and monthly RSI indicators all point to increasing strength. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 265, Rs 285 Stop-Loss: Rs 238 Fortis Healthcare | CMP: Rs 859 Fortis Healthcare is in a strong uptrend across all time frames, forming a consistent series of higher tops and bottoms. The stock recently registered an all-time high at Rs 867, reflecting continued bullish sentiment. It remains well above its 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-day SMAs, all of which are trending upward in line with the price. The daily, weekly, and monthly RSI indicators confirm rising strength. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 913, Rs 950 Stop-Loss: Rs 830 Vimta Labs | CMP: Rs 688.4 Following last week’s gains, Vimta Labs has decisively broken out of a 6–8 month consolidation zone (Rs 605–415) on a weekly closing basis. Rising volumes over the past three weeks indicate increased investor participation. The stock is currently trading above its 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-day SMAs, affirming a bullish trend. The daily and weekly Bollinger Bands buy signals point to growing momentum. The daily, weekly, and monthly RSI indicators all show increasing strength. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 800, Rs 890 Stop-Loss: Rs 625 Osho Krishan, Chief Manager - Technical & Derivative Research at Angel One Asian Paints | CMP: Rs 2,431 Asian Paints demonstrated a strong recovery last week and has now surpassed all major EMAs on the daily chart. The stock has retraced nearly 61.80% of its recent rally and has gained momentum post its quarterly earnings, suggesting potential for further upside. The alignment of momentum indicators with a positive crossover among EMAs, along with a strong rise in trading volumes, suggests sustained bullish momentum in the near term. Hence, we recommend buying Asian Paints around Rs 2,400. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,540, Rs 2,570 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,300 Schaeffler India | CMP: Rs 4,100.8 Schaeffler India has seen a decent surge recently, followed by consolidation in the form of a 'Flag' pattern on the daily chart. The stock is hovering near its 20 DEMA, with a bullish bias. It has formed a higher low on the daily chart and displays a positive crossover in technical indicators, further reinforcing bullish sentiment. From a risk-reward perspective, the setup is favourable for short- to medium-term gains. We recommend buying Schaeffler India around Rs 4,100–Rs 4,050. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 4,450, Rs 4,700 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,800 Anshul Jain, Head of Research at Lakshmishree Investments Hitachi Energy India | CMP: Rs 20,550 Hitachi Energy India has broken out of a 39-day-long cup and handle pattern at Rs 20,400, demonstrating strong momentum. Notably, the stock has maintained its position near recent highs despite broader market corrections — a clear sign of relative strength on both daily and weekly charts. Its ability to resist selling pressure and maintain structure reflects strong underlying demand. This kind of outperformance amid market weakness signals bullish intent and positions the stock well for further gains if broader sentiment stabilizes. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 23,500 Stop-Loss: Rs 19,500 AGI Infra | CMP: Rs 1,075.9 AGI Infra is displaying strong relative strength compared to the Nifty, which has declined over 4.4% in the past 24 days, while AGI has gained over 21% — a clear indication of institutional accumulation. The stock recently broke out of a 121-day cup and handle pattern and is now forming an 8-day flag, resembling a base-on-base setup. This structure is considered superior as it often leads to sustained momentum, especially when followed by a breakout on strong volumes. With the price holding firm and the pattern tightening, a high-volume breakout could trigger the next sharp leg up. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,200 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,025 Metropolis Healthcare | CMP: Rs 2037.7 Metropolis Healthcare broke out of a 101-day-long cup and handle pattern at Rs 1,880 on July 9, supported by a massive volume spike — over 1,525% of its 50-day average — indicating strong institutional interest. Following the breakout, the stock has consolidated over the last 16 sessions within the breakout bar’s range — a classic sign of healthy accumulation. This tight price action amid broader market volatility reflects strong relative strength versus the Nifty. A breakout above Rs 2,120 will confirm continuation and could lead to a sharp rally, with an immediate target of Rs 2,600 in the coming weeks. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,600 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,920 Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

These 30 smallcaps jumped up to 24% even as broader indices underperformed,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/these-30-smallcaps-jumped-up-to-24-even-as-broader-indices-underperformed-13377291.html,"The broader indices underperformed the main indices, losing between 1 and 2.5 percent in the week ended August 1, amid subdued earnings, continued FII selling, dollar appreciation, and trade tensions after US President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on Indian goods. For the week, the BSE Large-cap Index shed 1.2 percent, the BSE Mid-cap Index declined 1.8 percent, BSE Small-cap Index shed 2.5 percent. However, the BSE Sensex index declined 863.18 points or 1.05 percent to end at 80,599.91, while Nifty50 fell 271.65 points or 1.09 percent to close at 24,565.35. For the month of July, Sensex and Nifty lost nearly 3 percent each. The Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) extended their selling in their fifth consecutive week, as they sold equities worth Rs 20,524.42 crore; however, the Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) continued their buying in the 15th week, as they bought equities worth Rs 24,300.05 crore. In this month on July, FII sold equities worth Rs 47,666.68 crore, while DII bought equities worth Rs 60,939.16crore. On the sectoral, the Nifty Realty index slipped 5.7 percent, the Nifty Metal index shed 3.4 percent, Nifty PSU Bank index declined 3.2 percent, the Nifty Media index fell 3 percent; however, the Nifty FMCG index rose 3 percent. ""Domestic equity market navigated a volatile week marked by heightened uncertainty surrounding trade negotiations and subdued earnings. The market oscillated between cautious optimism and defensive positioning, ultimately ending lower due to a persistent FII outflow,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments. ""With global headwinds, investors showed a preference for domestically driven stories with non-discretionary appeal, as broader sentiment turned selective. FMCG stocks stood out, benefiting from attractive valuations and insulation from external shocks, particularly amid escalating tariff threats."" ""Globally, markets remained under pressure due to rising US inflation and hawkish signals from the Fed and BoJ, dampening hopes of immediate easing of interest rates, which weighed heavily on emerging markets."" ""Going forward, investors will closely monitor the upcoming RBI rate decision next week, while the risks remain tilted to the downside. A stable inflation outlook, potential progress in trade talks, and selective strength in domestic sectors are anticipated to lay the groundwork for a recovery,"" he added. The BSE Small-cap index shed 2.5 percent with Home First Finance Company India, Zen Technologies, Paras Defence and Space Technologies, Redington, Five-Star Business Finance, SML Isuzu, Kitex Garments, Faze Three, Blue Dart Express, Sportking India, Sindhu Trade Links, Indo Tech Transformers, Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals, Himatsingka Seide falling between 10-17 percent. On the other hand, Jayaswal Neco Industries, Saurashtra Cement, Vimta Labs, Advait Energy, CarTrade Tech, Bliss GVS Pharma, and Sudarshan Chemical Industries gained between 15-24 percent. Where is Nifty50 headed? Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities Nifty witnessed another sharp decline as it failed to reclaim the 200-DMA on the hourly chart, despite a strong recovery on Thursday. On Friday, the index remained below the 50-EMA on the hourly timeframe. On the daily chart, it has broken below the recent consolidation support at 24,600. Sentiment remains weak, with the potential for the correction to extend towards 24,400–24,450. A further decline is likely if it slips below 24,400; otherwise, a recovery can be expected. On the higher side, resistance is seen at 24,600–24,650 and 24,850. Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets began the August series on a negative note, extending the prevailing corrective trend, and ended lower by over half a percent. Markets continue to grapple with a mixed earnings season, while the recent tariff announcement and persistent foreign fund outflows are further weighing on sentiment. Nifty is now approaching its next crucial support at 24,450; a breach of this level could trigger a retest of the long-term moving average, the 200-day EMA, near 24,180. On the upside, the 24,800–25,000 zone is expected to act as a strong hurdle. We maintain our cautious stance and continue to recommend a hedged approach with a negative bias until clear signs of reversal emerge. Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities Nifty is currently placed near the crucial support of around 24500 levels (multiple swing lows of May-June 25), but the sustainable recovery has not emerged from near the support so far. The bearish lower highs and lower lows pattern is intact on the daily chart. Nifty on the weekly chart formed a reasonable negative candle this week, which is the fifth consecutive bearish candle formation on the trot. The previous sharp upside breakout of the larger range movement of last month has been completely negated, and the market slipped below the immediate support zone of the 24600 mark.

Option trading for range-bound market: Shubham Agarwal,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/expert-columns/option-trading-for-range-bound-market-shubham-agarwal-13364809.html,"It is worrisome when the major index like Nifty is changed by a little over a percent in the last 3 months. The volatility has been there, but that too in a good 3-4% range. These are the times when a simple Buy and Hold strategy can get frustrating. In such times of range-bound movement, especially, initiating a bearish trade after a big fall feels like going against the trend. The risk of indices and stocks getting back into the range is very high. So essentially, we need a trade that does not hurt us if the very short-term trend ends right after we take the trade. At the same time, we need not miss the opportunity nor be too protective. Detect a range-bound market with the following 3 characteristics visible in the equities market. 1. The Highs and Lows made a few weeks back have not been broken (and sustained)2. Open Interest in Nifty Calls and Puts is almost equal (Publicly available information on NSE website)3. India VIX has dropped in the last few weeksAs soon as it is established, we can treat and trade such market conditions like a range-bound market. Trading Technique #1 Put a Butterfly in place in Nifty Creating this strategy is simple. Sell Both Call & Put of a strike closest to the current level of the index. Being an index, it is likely to be less volatile, and liquidity is enough as well. However, since selling options has an unknown risk profile, we will add a couple of more options to this. I always buy Protection. Along with the Sell Options, Buy a Higher Strike Call Option and a Lower Strike Put Option. An easy way to choose the strike is that the difference between the Buy strikes could be equal to the total premium received by selling options. Example: Index at 1000Sell 1000 Call @ 50Sell 1000 Put @ 50Total Premium received 100Buy 1100 Call & Buy 900 Put for Protection. Maximum Profit would be the net premium received, and maximum Loss would be the difference between Buy strike & Sell Strike minus the Net Premium received. It’s always better to get this economics right before entering the trade. Trading Technique #2 As far as individual stocks are concerned, we can resort to options there as well. However, we need to keep in mind that there will be a lack of big moves, so adjust the trades accordingly. Also, care must be taken for the fact that stocks and indices could keep moving down from the upper end of the range and moving up from the lower end. To handle this:1. While trading stock options, we could keep our price target and stop losses smaller.2. Take trades in single Options (Buy Call/Put) for 1 -2 days3. When we are close to a recent high, have a mix of Buy Call & Buy Put (Bullish & Bearish) trades Range-bound market has an attractive characteristic of not having to commit to the trade for a longer period. History says that many small trades do improve the probability of profit. So, range-bound markets are also equally profitable if traded effectively using Options.

"Stocks slump on latest tariffs, soft jobs data",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/stocks-slump-on-latest-tariffs-soft-jobs-data-13375128.html,"US stocks slumped on Friday, and the S&P suffered its biggest daily percentage decline in more than two months as new U.S. tariffs on dozens of trading partners and a surprisingly weak jobs report spurred selling pressure. Also weighing on equities was an 8.3% tumble in Amazon.com shares after the company posted quarterly results but failed to meet lofty expectations for its Amazon Web Services cloud computing unit. Just hours before the tariff deadline on Friday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order imposing duties on U.S. imports from countries, including Canada, Brazil, India and Taiwan, in his latest round of levies as countries attempted to seek ways to reach better deals. Further denting confidence in the economic picture, data showed U.S. job growth slowed more than expected in July while the prior month's report was revised sharply lower, indicating the labor market may be starting to crack. The report significantly pushed up expectations the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its September meeting. ""There’s no way to pretty-up this report. Previous months were revised significantly lower where the labor market has been on stall-speed,"" said Brian Jacobsen, Chief Economist at Annex Wealth Management in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin. ""Last year the Fed messed up by not cutting in July so they did a catch-up cut at their next meeting. They’ll likely have to do the same thing this year.""

For the week, the S&P 500 fell 2.36%, the Nasdaq declined 2.17%, and the Dow fell 2.92%. The CBOE Volatility Index, also known as Wall Street's fear gauge, closed up 3.66 points at 20.38, its highest close since June 20.

Stocks briefly extended declines after Trump said he ordered the commissioner of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Erika L. McEntarfer, to be fired in the wake of the jobs data. ""(Trump) didn't seem to be disappointed with the last five jobs reports,"" said Art Hogan, Chief Market Strategist, B. Riley Wealth, Boston, saying that the firing stood out as irregular. ""I think this is clearly something that happens in dictatorships, not in democracies.” The Federal Reserve said Governor Adriana Kugler is resigning early from her term and will exit the central bank on Aug. 8, enabling President Donald Trump to select a new governor as he has ramped up pressure against Chair Jerome Powell recently to cut interest rates.

"Chartist Talk: Sudeep Shah shares 2 buy and 2 sell picks amid market caution; Nifty at risk below 24,400",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/chartist-talk-this-vp-shares-2-buy-and-2-sell-picks-amid-market-caution-nifty-at-risk-below-24-400-13373897.html,"The Nifty now traded below its 20-day, 50-day, and even 100-day EMA, and daily RSI fell below the 40 mark, signalling the bearish sentiment. Hence, the caution is advised and the 24,400-24,350 is expected to be crucial for further downside in the Nifty 50, said Sudeep Shah, Vice President and Head of Technical and Derivative Research at SBI Securities in an interview to Moneycontrol. Amid market caution, he advised two buy (Emami and Jindal Stainless) and two sell picks (Tata Steel and Aurobindo Pharma) for the next week. With this week's rally, Emami has managed to reclaim both its short-term and long-term moving averages, reinforcing the positive shift in momentum, while on Friday, Jindal Stainless gave a Symmetrical Triangle breakout on the daily scale which is confirmed by robust volume. Further, Aurobindo Pharma on Friday has given an upward sloping trendline breakdown on a daily scale accompained by robust volume, while Tata Steel slipped below its 100-day EMA level on Friday, which is a bearish sign, Sudeep reasoned. Do you see the Nifty easily breaking below its 200-day EMA in the coming week? The benchmark index Nifty wrapped up its fifth consecutive week in the red — its longest losing streak since August 2023, raising eyebrows across the street. What adds to the concern is the back-to-back formation of bearish candles with long upper shadows on the weekly chart. This pattern is a classic sign of rejection at higher levels. Despite making multiple attempts to scale up, the index has struggled to hold ground, only to be met with selling pressure each time. The long upper wicks are a telling story — bulls tried, but bears had the final say. It reflects a market that’s finding it hard to build on gains, weighed down by renewed supply pressure, and a cautious sentiment hovering overhead. Several factors have contributed to this shift in tone — from renewed concerns around the progress of India–US trade negotiations, to persistent FII outflows, and a string of underwhelming corporate earnings that failed to meet market expectations. The broader markets weren’t spared either. Both the Nifty Midcap and Nifty Small Cap 100 indices came under notable selling pressure and have now underperformed the frontline index for the second consecutive week. Adding to the concern, the ratio charts comparing these broader indices to the Nifty have slipped to their lowest levels in nearly two months, pointing to deteriorating relative strength and increasing caution among market participants when it comes to mid and small-cap exposures. Technically, Nifty is now trading below its 20-day, 50-day, and even 100-day EMA — a sign of mounting weakness. The daily RSI has dipped below the 40 mark and continues to trend lower, reinforcing the underlying bearish momentum. Talking about key levels, the zone of 24,400–24,350 is expected to act as an immediate support for Nifty. A sustained break below this could further accelerate the downside. On the flip side, the 50-day EMA zone of 24,900–24,950 now stands as a crucial hurdle, and any meaningful recovery would need to clear this zone with conviction. Looking at the medium-term structure, the 24,000–23,900 zone holds even greater significance. This area is likely to serve as a vital support base, and any breach below it could lead to a deeper corrective phase in the index. Despite its recent outperformance relative to the Nifty 50, do you expect the Bank Nifty to extend its downtrend and test the June lows as well as the 100-day EMA? The banking benchmark index, Bank Nifty, traded within a narrow range of 2,081 points during July — its tightest monthly range since July 2023. After posting gains for four consecutive months, the index finally snapped its winning streak and closed the July month on a negative note. On the monthly chart, Bank Nifty has formed a bearish candle, indicating a loss of momentum and a potential pause in the prevailing uptrend. At present, the index is trading below both its 20-day and 50-day exponential moving averages, with both averages exhibiting a downward slope — a sign of prevailing weakness. Additionally, the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) has slipped below the 40 mark and continues to trend lower, reflecting fading momentum and increasing bearish pressure. The daily MACD stays bearish as it is quoting below its zero line and signal line. The MACD histogram is suggesting a pickup in downside momentum. Going ahead, the zone of 55,200-55,100 will act as an important support for the index. If the index slips below the 55,100 level, then the next crucial support is placed at the 54,600 level. On the upside, the zone of 56,300-56,400 will act as an immediate hurdle for the index. Do you anticipate the rally in Suzlon Energy and Kaynes Technology India to continue in the coming week? Yes, based on the recent price action and technical indicators, the rally in both Suzlon Energy and Kaynes Technology India appears poised to extend into the coming week. During the previous week, both stocks took strong support near their respective 200-day EMA — a key long-term trend indicator closely tracked by market participants. This support acted as a springboard for a sharp and decisive rebound. What adds conviction to this recovery is the surge in trading volumes, which confirms that the rebound is backed by strong market participation and not merely a technical pullback. Moreover, both counters are now trading comfortably above their key short and medium-term moving averages, reinforcing the strength of the ongoing uptrend. In addition, momentum indicators such as the RSI and MACD are showing signs of continued bullish traction, indicating sustained buying interest. Given these favourable technical signals, we expect both Suzlon Energy and Kaynes Technology India to maintain their positive momentum and continue to outperform in the short term, provided broader market conditions remain stable. Which two stocks would you prefer to bet on for the upcoming week? Emami The Nifty FMCG has strongly outperformed frontline indices in the last week. The stock of Emami has found strong support near its upward-sloping trendline, which has been intact since April 2023 by connecting key swing lows. Following this retest, the stock witnessed a sharp upside rally, indicating a solid reversal from the support zone — a move that was further validated by robust volume participation, adding strength to the price action. With this upmove, the stock has managed to reclaim both its short-term and long-term moving averages, reinforcing the positive shift in momentum. Additionally, the daily RSI has surged past the 60 mark and is trending higher, signaling growing bullish strength and increasing buying interest. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 620-615 level with a stop-loss of Rs 595 level. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 660 in the short term. Jindal Stainless On Friday, the stock gave a Symmetrical Triangle breakout on the daily scale. This breakout is confirmed by robust volume. Currently, the stock is trading above its short and long-term moving averages. These averages are in rising mode, and they are in the desired sequence, which reinforces the strength of the ongoing trend. The daily RSI has surged above the 60 mark, and it is in rising mode, suggesting sustained momentum and increasing bullish sentiment. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 710-700 level with a stop-loss of Rs 680 level. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 760 in the short term. Are you particularly bullish on GE Vernova T&D and Radico Khaitan, given their continued higher highs and higher low formation? What are your price targets for both in August? GE Vernova T&D While GE Vernova T&D has displayed remarkable strength in recent sessions, locking in upper circuits for the past three consecutive trading days. Going ahead, it is important to exercise caution at this juncture. The stock has already witnessed a steep vertical rally, and its daily RSI is now approaching the overbought territory, indicating stretched short-term momentum. In such scenarios, the risk-reward becomes unfavourable for fresh entries. Hence, we advise avoiding any immediate exposure to the stock until it cools off or offers a healthy consolidation. Radico Khaitan Radico Khaitan has shown encouraging technical strength by breaking out of a consolidation pattern on the daily chart in Friday’s session. The breakout was supported by decent volumes, which is a positive sign. However, after touching an intraday high of Rs 2,940, the stock faced some profit booking, ultimately forming a bullish candle with a long upper shadow. This suggests selling pressure at higher levels. For the stock to resume its upward trajectory convincingly, it must sustain above Rs 2,900 mark. If that level is reclaimed and held, we expect Radico Khaitan to potentially move towards Rs 3,025–3,075 in August, provided market sentiment remains supportive. Considering the current market weakness, are there any two stocks you'd look to short in the coming week, and what’s your rationale? Aurobindo Pharma The stock has strongly underperformed the Nifty Pharma index in the last couple of months. On Friday, the stock has given an upward sloping trendline breakdown on a daily scale. This breakdown is confirmed by robust volume. Also, it is trading below its crucial moving averages. The daily RSI has given a breakdown of upward sloping trendline. Hence, we believe the stock is likely to continue its southward journey and test the level of Rs 1,000 in the short term. Tata Steel The stock has slipped below its 100-day EMA level on Friday, which is a bearish sign. In the recent pullback, the daily RSI has failed to cross 60 mark and thereafter slipped below 40 mark, which is a bearish sign as per RSI range shift rules. The daily MACD histogram is suggesting pickup in downside momentum. Hence, we believe it is likely to continue its southward journey and test the level of 145 in the short term.

"Taking Stock: Nifty below 24,600 in fifth week of fall, big selloff in pharma",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/taking-stock-nifty-below-24-600-in-fifth-week-of-fall-big-selloff-in-pharma-13367331.html,"Benchmark indices ended lower for a second consecutive session on August 1, marking the fifth week of losses, with Nifty closing below 24,600 on the first day of the August series, as selling across sectors weighed on the sentiment, majorly in pharma names. This has been the longest weekly losing streak in two years for Nifty 50. Tracking weak global cues, the indices had opened lower but recovered, however, a mid-session profit booking and extended selloff in the final hour dragged Nifty below 24,550, ending near day's low. At close, the Sensex was down 585.67 points or 0.72 percent at 80,599.91, and the Nifty was down 203 points or 0.82 percent at 24,565.35.

Click to View More Outlook for August 4 Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities Nifty witnessed another sharp decline as it failed to reclaim the 200-DMA on the hourly chart, despite a strong recovery on Thursday. Throughout the day, the index remained below the 50-EMA on the hourly timeframe. On the daily chart, it has broken below the recent consolidation support at 24,600. Sentiment remains weak, with the potential for the correction to extend towards 24,400–24,450. A further decline is likely if it slips below 24,400; otherwise, a recovery can be expected. On the higher side, resistance is seen at 24,600–24,650 and 24,850. Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets began the August series on a negative note, extending the prevailing corrective trend, and ended lower by over half a percent. The first half of the session remained range-bound, with Nifty oscillating in a narrow band. However, selling pressure in heavyweights during the final hours dragged the index below its medium-term moving average—the 100-day EMA—near the 24,600 mark, eventually settling at 24,565.35. On the sectoral front, pharma, metal, and IT were among the top losers. The broader indices also witnessed sharp cuts, each losing nearly 1.5%, resulting in a significant decline in market breadth. Markets continue to grapple with a mixed earnings season, while the recent tariff announcement and persistent foreign fund outflows are further weighing on sentiment. Nifty is now approaching its next crucial support at 24,450; a breach of this level could trigger a retest of the long-term moving average, the 200-day EMA, near 24,180. On the upside, the 24,800–25,000 zone is expected to act as a strong hurdle. We maintain our cautious stance and continue to recommend a hedged approach with a negative bias until clear signs of reversal emerge. Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities After showing high volatility on Thursday, Nifty slipped into a sharp weakness amidst choppy movement on Friday and closed the day lower by 203 points. A long negative candle was formed on the daily chart on Friday at the new swing lows beside the long bull candle of previous session. Technically, this market action is suggesting inherent weakness in the market to sustain the bounces. Nifty is currently placed near the crucial support of around 24500 levels (multiple swing lows of May-June 25), but the sustainable recovery has not emerged from near the supports so far. Bearish lower highs and lower lows pattern is intact on the daily chart. Nifty on the weekly chart formed a reasonable negative candle this week, which is for the fifth consecutive bearish candle formation on the trot. The previous sharp upside breakout of larger range movement of last month has been completely negated and the market slipped below the immediate support zone of 24600 mark. The underlying trend of Nifty remains weak. A decisive move below the support of 24500, Nifty could slide down towards the next lower area of 24100-24000 levels in the near term. Immediate resistance is placed at 24950 levels. Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

At close, the Sensex fell 0.5 percent, shedding 420 points to end at 80,761.70, while the Nifty declined 0.61 percent or 151 points to settle at 24,620. Asian markets were largely in the red, with indices in South Korea, Japan, China and Hong Kong trading lower. The negative trend followed weak closing on Wall Street, and US futures indicating a subdued start, further dampening investor confidence. ""Investor sentiment weakened further as FIIs now hold the second-highest net short position in derivatives, reflecting elevated caution. Globally, markets turned negative amid rising U.S. inflation and trade tensions. While the sell-off was broad-based, FMCG stocks emerged as a defensive play, supported by attractive valuations, resilient demand, and relative immunity to external trade disruptions"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments Sectoral indices were broadly in the red, with Nifty Pharma emerging as the biggest loser, dropping 3.3 percent following US President Donald Trump’s call for drugmakers to slash prices. Nifty IT and Nifty Metal also saw sharp declines, each down over 1.5 percent, while Nifty Realty and Nifty Auto slipped 1.3 percent and 0.6 percent, respectively. The broader market sentiment took a hit after President Trump imposed a 25 percent tariff plus penalty on Indian imports, raising concerns over trade dynamics. However, economists believe the GDP impact for India will remain contained, estimated between 0.1 to 0.3 percentage points. Despite the near-term disruptions, India is expected to continue benefiting from global supply chain shifts. Technically, the Nifty continues to struggle near resistance. Anand James, Chief Market Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, noted that the index once again failed to decisively cross the 24,960 level. He maintains a cautiously optimistic stance, stating that sustained trade above 24,675 could trigger another upswing, while a breakdown below the 24,650–24,600 zone could lead to a fall toward 24,450. A breakout above 25,000 could potentially push the index towards 25,330, he added.","At close, the Sensex fell 0.5 percent, shedding 420 points to end at 80,761.70, while the Nifty declined 0.61 percent or 151 points to settle at 24,620.","While the sell-off was broad-based, FMCG stocks emerged as a defensive play, supported by attractive valuations, resilient demand, and relative immunity to external trade disruptions"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments Sectoral indices were broadly in the red, with Nifty Pharma emerging as the biggest loser, dropping 3.3 percent following US President Donald Trump’s call for drugmakers to slash prices.","Indian equity benchmarks ended lower for a second consecutive session on August 1, mirroring global market weakness as heightened US tariffs dampened investor sentiment.","While the sell-off was broad-based, FMCG stocks emerged as a defensive play, supported by attractive valuations, resilient demand, and relative immunity to external trade disruptions"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments Sectoral indices were broadly in the red, with Nifty Pharma emerging as the biggest loser, dropping 3.3 percent following US President Donald Trump’s call for drugmakers to slash prices."

This comes after the US President Donald Trump announced 25 percent tariff and an additional penalty on India, rattling the export-oriented stocks. Bangladesh has secured a trade deal with US, agreeing on 20 percent export tariff. This is significantly lower than the 37 percent initially proposed by the US President. This further fuelled the downturn in the stocks, as Indian textile exports will now face higher tariffs on exports than their rivals from Bangladesh. Gokaldas Exports shares dropped more than 4 percent to trade at Rs 814 in the afternoon. The stock has now declined nearly 9 percent over the two days. Notably, nearly 70 percent of the company’s topline comes from the US market. Indo Count Industries, which has a similar exposure to US market, saw its shares price decline more than 4 percent. The stock has dropped around 8 percent so far. Welspun Living and Vardhman Textiles shares also declined 4 percent each, while Pearl Global Industries shares plunged more than 6 percent. Trident shares declined more than 3 percent, while KPR Mill shares dropped up to 6 percent each. Among the smallcap stocks, Credo shares declined 20 percent to hit the lower circuit. Notably, Indian textile players compete with rivals in Bangladesh, Vietnam and China. ""Investors will reassess their strategies with a mix of caution and optimism after the tariffs and penalties imposed on Indian goods,"" said Utsav Verma, head of research at Choice Institutional Equities.

Sentiment took a hit after fresh tariff actions by the US, with Donald Trump unexpectedly hiking import duties on Canadian goods to 35 percent from 25 percent. At about 12:45 pm, the Sensex was down 324.56 points or 0.40 percent at 80,861.02, and the Nifty was down 124.25 points or 0.50 percent at 24,644.10. About 1399 shares advanced, 2005 shares declined, and 135 shares remained unchanged. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates ""Since the date of implementation of the modified tariff rates is August 7th, that gives countries time to negotiate and bring the tariffs down. That may happen,"" says V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments Limited.""An important trend in the market is the weakness in the broader market, particularly the smallcaps. This trend is likely to continue given the high valuations of the segment. Sustained selling by the FIIs continues to be a negative. The sharp surge in the dollar index to 100 will nudge the FIIs to continue selling, putting pressure on large caps too. Investors can adopt a wait-and-watch strategy,"" he added. Sectoral indices were largely in the red on Friday. Nifty Pharma led the losses with a sharp 2.84 percent drop, followed by Nifty IT and Oil & Gas, which fell 1.26 percent and 1.05 percent, respectively. Nifty Metal declined 0.93 percent, while Auto, Infra, Realty, and Midcap 100 indices also saw notable declines. Nifty FMCG and Media were the only gainers, rising 0.86 percent and 1.03 percent, respectively. Other sectors, including Bank, Private Bank, Consumer Durables, and Smallcap 100, edged lower. India VIX rose 1.65 percent to 11.73, indicating slightly higher market volatility. Among movers, shares of PNB Housing Finance fell sharply by over 15 percent on August 1, a day after the lender informed that the resignation of MD and CEO Girish Kousgi has been accepted by the board, a move that some brokerage notes have cited as negative, given his role in transforming PNB Housing, scaling new businesses and improving asset quality. Hindustan Unilever (HUL) jumped nearly 8 percent on August 1, taking the stock's gains in two days to 12 percent. This comes after brokerages issued positive notes for the stock after the release of the firm's April-June quarter results. The FMCG major reported a 6 percent year-on-year rise in consolidated net profit to Rs 2,768 crore for the quarter ended June 2025, aided by lower tax expenses and volume-led sales growth across key categories. Revenue grew 5 percent to Rs 16,323 crore.

Sensex was volatile, facing resistance near its 50-EMA at 81,800 but holding above the 100-EMA at 80,800. A decisive move above 82,050 is needed for further upside, while 80,500 remains a critical support.

"HUL shares jump 12% in 2 days as brokerages hike target prices after Q1 results: Should you buy, sell or hold?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/hul-shares-jump-12-in-2-days-as-brokerages-hike-target-prices-after-q1-results-should-you-buy-sell-or-hold-13365839.html,"The shares of Hindustan Unilever (HUL) jumped nearly 8 percent on August 1, taking the stock's gains in two days to 12 percent. This comes after brokerages issued positive notes for the stock after the release of the firm's April-June quarter results. Hindustan Unilever (HUL) on July 31 reported a 6 percent year-on-year rise in consolidated net profit to Rs 2,768 crore for the quarter ended June 2025, aided by lower tax expenses and volume-led sales growth across key categories. Revenue (total sales) grew 5 percent to Rs 16,323 crore, with underlying volume growth (UVG) at 4 percent and underlying sales growth (USG) at 5 percent, HUL said in a stock exchange filing. Profit after tax before exceptional items declined 5 percent year-on-year to Rs 2,526 crore, while earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) for the quarter stood at Rs 3,718 crore, marginally down from Rs 3,744 crore in the year-ago period. The EBITDA margin declined 130 basis points to 22.8 percent, in line with the company’s guidance, as HUL continued to step up business investments. Should you buy, sell or hold? Goldman Sachs upgraded HUL shares to 'Buy' from its earlier 'Neutral' rating, and raised its target price to Rs 2,900 per share, from its earlier estimate of Rs 2,400 per share. The latest target price implies an upside potential of nearly 15 percent from the stock's previous closing price. According to Goldman Sachs, HUL is witnessing a turnaround which is fuelled by a combination of macro factors and internal initiatives, according to the note cited by CNBC-TV18. The international firm is hopeful that HUL's revenue growth will speed up to high-single-digit levels by the second half of the ongoing financial year 2026 and in financial year 2027. JM Financial retained its 'Buy' rating on the stock, but increased its target price to Rs 2,770 apiece. The domestic brokerage said that the firm’s Q1 earnings were in line with its estimates. ""We like HUL's strategy pivot to focus on growth at the cost of near-term margin. Mgmt. commentary on outlook remains optimistic – volume recovery to continue, GM also expected to improve sequentially as pricing/NMI gap reduces. Consol. margin guidance remains unchanged at 22-23% (delivered closer to upper end in 1Q). With macro narrative improving along with clear step up in portfolio interventions by HUL, the worst seems to be behind. Initial benefits are visible with uptick in sales for Market Makers/Future Core portfolio & further gradual recovery in Core (GAL/Lifebuoy) should also follow,"" it added. Motilal Oswal Financial Services kept a 'Buy' call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 3,000 apiece. This implies an upside potential of nearly 19 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. ""The company plans to focus aggressively on volume acceleration, alongside new launches and the reactivation of its value proposition, which is expected to drive better growth in FY26,"" the domestic brokerage said. HUL shares hit a day’s high of Rs 2,727 in early morning trade. The stock later pared some gains to trade 2 percent higher at Rs 2,578 apiece.

Pharma stocks slump as Trump shoots letters to 17 global drug majors seeking lower prices,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/pharma-stocks-slump-as-trump-shoots-letters-to-17-global-drug-major-seeking-lower-prices-13365619.html,"Shares of leading pharma companies are sharply lower, as investors tried to assess the impact of US President Trump's letter to 17 of the global drug majors demanding them lower drug prices in US and bring it in-line with what other nations are paying for new medicines. The Nifty Pharma index fell over 2.8 percent to extend the fall for a third day, with Sun Pharma leading the fall with a 4 percent cut, followed by Aurobindo Pharma, Gland Pharma, Cipla, Granules India and Lupin down over 3 percent. As much as 20 percent of Sun Pharma's revenue comes from drugs sold in the US market. Shares of Sun Pharma were the worst hit on Nifty 50 following the quarterly earnings. Brokerage Investec has downgraded Sun Pharma by two notches to 'Sell', which had added to the sour sentiment. Trump's letters to 17 of the world’s biggest pharmaceutical majors has stated that companies should immediately lower charges for existing drugs, and furnish guarantee that future medicines be launched at par with what other countries are paying. The letters were sent to Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer and others, demanding that Most Favored Nation (MFN) pricing be implemented with in 60 days. During a briefing, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said, ""According to recent data, the prices that Americans have been paying for brand name drugs are more than three times the price of other similarly developed nations pay. The president is determined to solve this problem and took further action today. He has signed 17 letters to pharmaceutical companies' CEOs."" In the letter, Trump has issued a 60-day ultimatum to companies to voluntarily comply to the new pricing diktat, failing which US will deploy 'every tool in our arsenal' in order to protect Americans from 'continued abusive drug pricing' practices. Companies will also have to offer certain medicines directly to patients at prices at whch they are offered to third-party insurers, Trump's letter said. There is also an overhang of a pharma tariff policy coming soon, that US President had mentioned in the recent past. On July 29, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said during an interview with CNBC International that President Trump will be coming out with a pharmaceutical policy in the next two weeks, exploring higher tariffs on pharma companies. ""Basically, if you are not building your plant in America where we pay for pharmaceuticals, you are going to pay a massive tariff, because why should we pay for your drugs? And you make them overseas and you make your money overseas? At least if we’re going to pay for your drugs, you’re going to build them in America,"" Lutnick had said. Through the measure, Trump is seeking US drug makers to use the increased revenue from abroad for the benefit of American patients and tax payers by providing them direct access of medicines at MFN pricing. Sandeep Bhatia, Managing Director and Head of Equity India at Macquarie Capital told CNBC-TV18 that there is a potential fear of pricing pressure for the US supplies. ""...right now there's a fear that this most favoured nation (MFN) treatment for Medicaid and other US administered medical programmes, the pricing of that should match the pricing which the companies charge in other wealthy developed nations. So clearly there's a potentially a pricing pressure that can emerge for the US supplies."" CNBC International reported that spokespersons for Pfizer, Novo Nordisk and Novartis have said that they are working to find solutions to help Americans access affordable drugs.","""...right now there's a fear that this most favoured nation (MFN) treatment for Medicaid and other US administered medical programmes, the pricing of that should match the pricing which the companies charge in other wealthy developed nations.","Shares of leading pharma companies are sharply lower, as investors tried to assess the impact of US President Trump's letter to 17 of the global drug majors demanding them lower drug prices in US and bring it in-line with what other nations are paying for new medicines.","The letters were sent to Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer and others, demanding that Most Favored Nation (MFN) pricing be implemented with in 60 days.","Shares of leading pharma companies are sharply lower, as investors tried to assess the impact of US President Trump's letter to 17 of the global drug majors demanding them lower drug prices in US and bring it in-line with what other nations are paying for new medicines."

Eicher witnessed a 15 percent increase in revenue at Rs 5,042 crore in Q1 FY26. The gains come despite Morgan Stanley maintaining its Underweight rating with a target price of Rs 4,079. This implies a downside potential of 25 percent from the last close on the NSE. The management continues to focus on driving volumes over margins. However, the brokerage sees downside risks to consensus margin estimates, adding that the stock appears to be pricing in both high growth and high margins.

Speaking during the Q1 FY26 post-earnings call, the company’s management said it remains ""cautiously optimistic"" about overseas markets and is laying the groundwork for sustained expansion. Brazil, in particular, has emerged as a high-potential market for Royal Enfield, with its large two-wheeler customer base and improving macroeconomic environment. ""We see huge potential in Brazil. It’s a good two-wheeler market, and we’re putting the CKD (completely knocked down) infrastructure in place with two assembly partners already onboard,” the company said. Eicher is also working on localised financing options in the region to improve customer access. ""We’re tying up with banks to ensure seamless financing, and our retail footprint is expanding steadily."" Beyond Brazil, Eicher reported mixed trends across international markets. The UK remains muted due to an overhang of pre-registered inventory, but mainland Europe is seeing improving momentum. “We’ve taken distribution into our own hands in Europe and are now fixing the operational back end, including floor funding,” the management said.

Swiggy’s revenue from operations rose 54 percent YoY to Rs 4,961 crore in Q1, up from Rs 3,222 crore a year ago. It had reported a revenue of Rs 4,410 crore in the previous quarter. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates The drop comes despite two foreign brokerages issuing bullish calls on the stock, citing positive growth levels. Jefferies has upgraded Swiggy to a Buy with a target price of Rs 500 per share. The brokerage highlighted strong growth in the food delivery business during Q1 and noted continued momentum in quick commerce (Q-commerce). However, EBITDA margin declined quarter-on-quarter, primarily due to higher rider and staff costs. Despite this, management views Q1 as the trough for profitability, indicating improvement ahead. Morgan Stanley has maintained an ""Overweight"" rating on Swiggy, with a target price of Rs 450 per share. The brokerage said the food delivery segment is performing in line with expectations. It has also raised its profitability assumptions for the Q-commerce business and lowered loss projections based on positive commentary from the company on Q2 performance.

PNB Housing Finance to allay investor concerns after a 15 percent slide over MD and CEO Kousgi's exit,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/pnb-housing-finance-shares-slide-10-percent-on-md-and-ceo-girish-kousgi-s-exit-13365332.html,"Shares of PNB Housing Finance fell sharply by over 15 percent on August 1, a day after the lender informed that the resignation of MD and CEO Girish Kousgi has been accepted by the board, a move that some brokerage notes have cited as negative, given his role in transforming PNB Housing, scaling new businesses and improving asset quality. PNB Housing Finance said the company is scheduling an investor call on August 4, at 08:00 am regarding the resignation of the MD and CEO, likely to allays concerns around future growth trajectory. The board will 'immediately' commence a search for a 'seasoned professional with provenexpertise and industry experience'. Chairman of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee of PNB Housing Finance, R Chandrasekaran said, ‘’The Board will initiate a rigorous, transparent and merit-based selection process to appoint a new leader who will further enhance the legacy of PNB Housing Finance. We are confident of identifying a suitable professional soon, who will further accelerate our strategic direction and long-term value creation.” Girish Kousgi will step down from his role effective October 28 to pursue career aspirations outside the organization. During his tenure, Kousgi drove innovation and strategic evolution, and aligned the company with customer-centric solutions. The board appreciated Kousgi's leadership and mentorship through his tenure and wished him best for his future endeavours. PNB Housing Finance, promoted by Punjab National Bank, emerged as the third-largest housing finance company in India during Girish Kousgi's tenure. The management said it is fully-committed to executing its long-term strategy and growth initiatives. PNB Housing Finance assured on August 1 the strategic priorities, business focus and growth trajectory will remain 'firmly intact', building on the foundation by Kousgi. The board also exuded confidence that the team delivering the HFC's performance will continue to achieve growth, asset quality and margins.

"Maruti Suzuki shares rise over 1% after Q1; should you buy, sell or hold?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/maruti-suzuki-shares-rise-over-1-after-q1-should-you-buy-sell-or-hold-13364896.html,"Shares of Maruti Suzuki rose by over a percent to Rs 12,779 morning trade on August 1 after the company reported a 2 percent rise in net profit at Rs 3,712 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2025. It reported a net profit of Rs 3,650 crore in the year-ago period. The carmaker's revenue rose 8 percent to Rs 38,414 crore in Q1 FY26 as against Rs 35,531 crore a year ago. Non-operating income, or other income, for the quarter nearly doubled. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Jefferies has maintained a Buy rating on Maruti Suzuki, raising the target price to Rs 14,750 from Rs 13,600. While EBITDA fell 11 percent year-on-year, a significant improvement in average selling price (ASP) was offset by a decline in margins. The brokerage remains optimistic about demand but has trimmed its FY25–28 industry volume CAGR forecast from 8 percent to 6 percent. Jefferies flagged the continued decline in Maruti’s passenger vehicle (PV) market share as a concern. However, it noted that exports are growing steadily and a new ICE SUV is planned for launch in FY26. The firm expects a 12 percent CAGR in earnings per share over FY25–28. Reiterating a Buy rating on Maruti Suzuki, Motilal Oswal has set a target price of Rs 14,476, valuing the stock at 26x June FY27E EPS. The company is expected to benefit from multiple tailwinds in FY26, including the launch of the e-Vitara, a new SUV, and hybrid variants. Exports are projected to grow at least 20 percent, with around 70,000 units of the e-Vitara likely to be delivered, mostly to overseas markets. A favourable government policy on hybrids could act as a re-rating trigger, given MSIL’s strong positioning. While a 50 basis points margin pressure is expected in FY26 due to higher input costs, the company is projected to deliver a 10 percent earnings CAGR over FY25–27. Maruti Suzuki outpaced its peers in overseas sales during the June quarter, with exports rising 37.4 percent even as the rest of the industry saw a 2.1 percent decline. The carmaker now accounts for nearly half—47 percent—of India’s total passenger vehicle exports. Also read: Maruti Suzuki races ahead in export growth even as rivals lose ground Japan emerged as Maruti’s second-largest export market in Q1, ahead of several traditional markets. The company said it expects further growth once it begins shipping electric vehicles globally, including to Europe and Japan. After a sluggish start to the fiscal year, Maruti Suzuki is betting on a stronger second half, supported by new launches and a revival in rural demand. The company remains cautiously optimistic about industry growth and its ability to outperform peers despite muted volumes in the first quarter. Speaking during the post-earnings call, Maruti Suzuki’s management acknowledged that Q1 fell short of expectations, echoing broader concerns across the auto industry. “Q1 has not been up to the mark, but there are positives building up in Q2,” the company said, pointing to a better monsoon and steady rural sentiment. At about 9:20 am, shares of the company were trading at Rs 12,715, higher by 0.8 percent from the last close on the NSE. Maruti Suzuki shares have risen over 16 percent since the beginning of the year.

"Markets fall for 2nd day: Sensex down 200 pts, Nifty below 24,750 as IT, metals decline",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/markets-for-fall-for-2nd-day-sensex-down-200-pts-nifty-below-24-750-as-it-metals-decline-13365104.html,"Benchmark indices Nifty and Sensex were off to a weak start, kicking off the new month on a cautious note as fresh tariff actions by the US weigh on sentiment. In a surprise move, Donald Trump has raised import duties on Canadian goods to 35 percent from 25 percent, keeping global investors on edge. HUL was the brightest spark, rising 4 percent and extending gains after strong Q1 earnings. At about 9:20 am, the Sensex was down 156.08 points or 0.19 percent at 81,029.50, and the Nifty was down 48.30 points or 0.20 percent at 24,720.05. About 1618 shares advanced, 991 shares declined, and 137 shares were unchanged.

Nifty Metal was the biggest laggard, down 1.02 percent, followed by Nifty IT, which slipped 0.77 percent. Nifty PSU Bank and Oil & Gas fell 0.53 percent and 0.44 percent, respectively. The Auto, Bank, Consumer Durables, Private Bank, Midcap 100, and Smallcap 100 indices also edged lower. In contrast, Nifty FMCG was the standout gainer, rising 1.36 percent, while Nifty Media added 0.40 percent. Indices like Energy, Infra, Realty, and Pharma remained flat. Meanwhile, India VIX rose nearly 2 percent to 11.77, indicating a slight uptick in market volatility. Among individual stocks, Maruti Suzuki rose over a percent after the company reported 2 percent rise in net profit at Rs 3,712 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2025. The carmaker's revenue rose 8 percent to Rs 38,414 crore in Q1 FY26 as against Rs 35,531 crore a year ago. Jefferies has maintained a Buy rating on Maruti Suzuki, raising the target price to Rs 14,750 from Rs 13,600. Shares of Swiggy fell as much as 3 percent even as it reported that its net loss widened almost 96 percent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs 1,197 crore in the first quarter (Q1) of financial year 2025-26 (FY26), up from Rs 611 crore in the same period a year ago. The gains follow two foreign brokerages issuing bullish calls on the stock, citing positive growth levels. Jefferies has upgraded the counter to a buy while Morgan Stanley maintained its overweight rating. Two-wheeler major Eicher Motors rose over 2 percent after it reported a 9 percent rise in consolidated net profit at Rs 1,205 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2025. Eicher witnessed a 15 percent increase in revenue at Rs 5,042 crore in Q1 FY26. Morgan Stanley has maintained its Underweight rating. The brokerage sees downside risks to consensus margin estimates, adding that the stock appears to be pricing in both high growth and high margins. Technical View The support zone at 24,500–24,550 remains critical in the near term, while a convincing breakout above 24,900 could unlock further upside potential. For now, the Nifty continues to trade below the heavy resistance zone of 25,000, which also serves as a psychological barrier. Until this is reclaimed decisively, the overall sentiment remains cautious. Any short-term rally may attract renewed short positions unless backed by strong volumes and follow-through. Additionally, the long-short ratio, hovering around 14 percent, indicates an oversold territory, raising the possibility of a short-covering bounce — but only if the index breaks and sustains above the resistance zone. Hindustan Unilever, Tata Consumer Products, Hero MotoCorp, Asian Paints, and Maruti Suzuki were the top gainers on the Nifty. Laggards on the index included Dr Reddy's, ONGC, Cipla, Tata Steel, and JSW Steel.

"Sensex, Nifty to open lower as tariff uncertainty jolts investor mood; key levels to track on August 1",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sensex-nifty-to-open-lower-as-tariff-uncertainty-jolts-investor-mood-key-levels-to-track-on-august-1-13364852.html,"Benchmark indices Nifty and Sensex are set to open lower, starting the new month on a cautious note as fresh tariff actions by the US weigh on sentiment. In a surprise move, Donald Trump has raised import duties on Canadian goods to 35 percent from 25 percent, keeping global investors on edge. Dalal Street saw a choppy session in trade as investors weighed the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump imposing a 25 percent tariff and penalty on India. After opening with one percent losses, benchmark indices Nifty 50 and Sensex clawed back gains to trade in the green. However, the last hour of selling pressure drove the headline indices back into the red. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Here are the key levels to watch out for in today's session The index has clearly defined its key trading zone and appears stuck in a consolidation phase with limited momentum on either side. Although buyers have shown interest at lower levels, strong supply persists near resistance zones, making a directional bias elusive. The support zone at 24,500–24,550 remains critical in the near term, while a convincing breakout above 24,900 could unlock further upside potential. For now, the Nifty continues to trade below the heavy resistance zone of 25,000, which also serves as a psychological barrier. Until this is reclaimed decisively, the overall sentiment remains cautious. Any short-term rally may attract renewed short positions unless backed by strong volumes and follow-through. Additionally, the long-short ratio, hovering around 14%, indicates an oversold territory, raising the possibility of a short-covering bounce — but only if the index breaks and sustains above the resistance zone. ""The index has clearly defined its boundaries and remains confined within a consolidation zone, reflecting a lack of strong directional bias. While there are visible signs of accumulation at lower levels, sellers have consistently emerged from resistance zones, preventing any breakout attempts from gaining traction,"" Dhupesh Dhameja of SAMCO Securities said. ""The 55,500–55,700 band continues to serve as a critical support zone, while a breakout beyond 56,500 remains necessary to trigger sustained bullish momentum. For now, the Nifty Bank remains lodged beneath a heavy supply zone near the 56,500 mark — also coinciding with multiple key moving averages. Until the index decisively conquers this level, the broader trend remains cautious,"" he added. India VIX rose 3.01 percent, closing at 11.54. Despite significant negative cues, volatility stayed below the psychological 13 mark, suggesting that there is no panic or broad-based liquidation in the market. The subdued volatility implies that traders are expecting a continuation of the consolidation phase rather than a major breakdown. The Put-Call Ratio (PCR) has ticked up from 0.78 to 0.90, suggesting some bargain hunting at lower levels, although the upside remains constrained due to sustained overhead supply.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Bayer Cropscience, Jindal Stainless, General Insurance Corp, HUL, Bharti Hexacom, JSW Steel and others on August 1?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-bayer-cropscience-jindal-stainless-general-insurance-corp-hul-bharti-hexacom-jsw-steel-and-others-on-august-1-13363432.html,"The benchmark indices closed nearly 0.4 percent lower on July 31 following a Trump tariff-led volatile session. Bears dominated market breadth as about 1,786 shares declined, compared to 872 that gained on the NSE. The bearish sentiment is expected to prevail until the frontline indices provide a sustainable close above the medium-term moving average. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Jay Mehta, Technical Research at JM Financial Services Bayer Cropscience | CMP: Rs 6,322.5 Bayer Cropscience is currently forming a pennant pattern and is supported by the 20-day EMA following a breakout above the trendline resistance. The price action is displaying multiple Spinning Top and Doji candlestick patterns, indicating market indecision. A breakout above Rs 6,512 could target levels of Rs 7,200 and Rs 7,600, with a stop-loss at Rs 6,130 post-breakout. Additionally, a golden crossover at the start of the month supports a bullish outlook. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 7,200, Rs 7,600 Stop-Loss: Rs 6,130 Ajanta Pharma | CMP: Rs 2,751.4 Ajanta Pharma has broken out above a descending triangle pattern, supported by strong volume activity. A golden crossover was observed on Wednesday, reinforcing the bullish outlook. The price is currently finding support near its 20-EMA. A breakout above the resistance zone of Rs 2,850–2,862 could trigger a bullish move, potentially pushing the price toward Rs 3,000 and Rs 3,100. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,000, Rs 3,100 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,580 Mandar Bhojane, Senior Equity Research Analyst at Choice Broking Jindal Stainless | CMP: Rs 694.1 Jindal Stainless is displaying a strong bullish setup, with technical indicators aligning across multiple timeframes. On the daily chart, the stock is nearing a breakout from a descending triangle pattern, which typically signals accumulation and reduced selling pressure. A decisive close above Rs 700 with strong volumes would validate the breakout and could lead to a sharp upward rally. The stock is trading comfortably above its 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-day EMAs, indicating sustained strength across short-, medium-, and long-term horizons. The RSI is at 58.21, steadily rising and showing strong buying interest without being overbought. Momentum remains favourable, with a positive MACD bias, further supporting the bullish structure. Traders may consider a buy-on-dips strategy near Rs 675. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 777 Stop-Loss: Rs 655 NLC India | CMP: Rs 242.25 NLC India is consolidating near a key breakout zone, reflecting underlying strength. On the daily chart, the stock is forming a symmetrical triangle pattern, a classic bullish continuation setup. Rising volumes during this consolidation phase indicate growing investor interest, increasing the probability of an upside breakout. A decisive close above Rs 245 would confirm the breakout and could ignite strong bullish momentum. The RSI is at 57.85 and trending upward, signaling healthy momentum. On the downside, Rs 235 acts as immediate support and can be considered a buy-on-dips zone for positional traders. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 267 Stop-Loss: Rs 230 General Insurance Corporation of India | CMP: Rs 392.15 General Insurance Corporation of India is on the verge of a breakout from a falling trendline and a descending triangle pattern on the daily chart. This technical setup, along with rising volumes, reflects renewed buying interest and a potential trend reversal in favour of the bulls. From a momentum perspective, the RSI stands at 57.76, trending upward and showing bullish divergence, further supporting the strengthening momentum. On the downside, Rs 382 serves as a strong support level, making it a key accumulation zone for traders. If the stock sustains above current levels with continued volume participation, it could move toward a short-term target of Rs 440. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 440 Stop-Loss: Rs 369 Om Mehra, Technical Research Analyst at Samco Securities Hindustan Unilever | CMP: Rs 2,512.20 Hindustan Unilever decisively broke out of a downward-sloping flag pattern on the daily chart. This bullish continuation pattern emerged after a sharp recovery from the Rs 2,400 level. Thursday’s breakout was backed by a notable rise in volume, confirming strong follow-through momentum. The stock reclaimed the Rs 2,510 horizontal resistance, which had capped gains in a previous breakout attempt. The candle structure shows a wide bullish body with a close near the day’s high, indicating strong institutional buying and no signs of upper wick exhaustion. The daily RSI rebounded sharply from the 50 level and is now near 64, climbing above its signal line and hinting at improving bullish momentum. The surge in volume adds further credibility to the breakout. The flag breakout, along with a rebound in the FMCG sector, suggests potential short-term upside. The Rs 2,470–2,480 zone can be considered for accumulation on any pullback. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,640 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,460 JSW Steel | CMP: Rs 1,048.3 JSW Steel is breaking out above a rising triangle formation on the daily chart after facing multiple rejections near the Rs 1,045 zone. The stock has consistently formed higher lows since March, with the trendline now acting as a critical support—underlining the bullish setup. The breakout candle is accompanied by a noticeable increase in volume and has closed near the day’s high, indicating sustained strength. The RSI has risen sharply to 65, crossing above its signal line and confirming strengthening momentum. Meanwhile, the MACD is nearing a bullish crossover. The stock has formed a solid base in the Rs 1,030–1,035 range, and with the current breakout above Rs 1,045, the bullish trend is likely to extend further. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,095 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,025 Bharti Hexacom | CMP: Rs 1,847.70 Bharti Hexacom has regained strength, staging a breakout after forming a double bottom base near the Rs 1,750 zone. The pattern had been developing over the past few weeks within a defined rectangle range, and Thursday’s move confirms a bullish reversal from recent consolidation. The stock reclaimed the 20-EMA and crossed above the upper horizontal resistance near Rs 1,840, which had capped multiple intraday rallies. The breakout candle closed near the day’s high with above-average volume, indicating renewed strength. The RSI has rebounded to 56, validating the breakout with improving momentum. The price is also trending above the 50-SMA, which is expected to act as immediate support on any dip. The daily Supertrend indicator also supports the bullish bias. Any pullback toward the Rs 1,820 zone would present a good accumulation opportunity.

Speaking during the Q1 FY26 post-earnings call, the company’s management said it remains ""cautiously optimistic"" about overseas markets and is laying the groundwork for sustained expansion. Brazil, in particular, has emerged as a high-potential market for Royal Enfield, with its large two-wheeler customer base and improving macroeconomic environment.

It’s a good two-wheeler market, and we’re putting the CKD (completely knocked down) infrastructure in place with two assembly partners already onboard,” the company said. Eicher is also working on localised financing options in the region to improve customer access. ""We’re tying up with banks to ensure seamless financing, and our retail footprint is expanding steadily."" Beyond Brazil, Eicher reported mixed trends across international markets. The UK remains muted due to an overhang of pre-registered inventory, but mainland Europe is seeing improving momentum. “We’ve taken distribution into our own hands in Europe and are now fixing the operational back end, including floor funding,” the management said. Australia continues to perform well, while Indonesia has also shown encouraging growth. However, the company acknowledged ongoing challenges in Thailand. In South Asia, Royal Enfield is seeing strong traction in Bangladesh and Nepal, with both CKD facilities operating at full capacity.

"Maruti Suzuki pins festive hopes on new launches, rural recovery amid tepid start to FY26",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/maruti-suzuki-pins-festive-hopes-on-new-launches-rural-recovery-amid-tepid-start-to-fy26-13361008.html,"After a sluggish start to the fiscal year, Maruti Suzuki is betting on a stronger second half, supported by new launches and a revival in rural demand. The company remains cautiously optimistic about industry growth and its ability to outperform peers despite muted volumes in the first quarter. Speaking during the post-earnings call, Maruti Suzuki’s management acknowledged that Q1 fell short of expectations, echoing broader concerns across the auto industry. “Q1 has not been up to the mark, but there are positives building up in Q2,” the company said, pointing to a better monsoon and steady rural sentiment. Also read: Fiscal deficit for June quarter at 17.9% of full-year target, a quarter of annual capex spent The festive season, which spans the second and third quarters, is expected to be a key demand trigger. “We are looking at Q2 and the festive season with optimism,” the management noted, adding that the company is hopeful of a stronger showing compared to the performance so far this year. Maruti Suzuki has lined up two new SUV launches for the current financial year—one of them electric—which the company believes will bolster its market position. These launches are expected to play a pivotal role in meeting the company’s guidance of outpacing industry growth, pegged at around 2 to 3 percent. SIAM, the industry body, had initially projected growth of 1 to 2 percent for FY26, but a weak Q1 has cast some doubt on that outlook. Still, Maruti’s management is confident that upcoming product activity and a better festive season could help the sector regain momentum. During the quarter, Maruti Suzuki reported a 2 percent rise in net profit at Rs 3,712 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2025. The carmaker's revenue rose 8 percent to Rs 38,414 crore in Q1 FY26 as against Rs 35,531 crore a year ago. Non-operating income, or other income, nearly doubled.

In the June quarter, Maruti Suzuki's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) dropped 11 percent at Rs 3,995 crore from Rs 4,502 crore in the same quarter last year. The operating margin dropped by 227 basis points to 10.40 percent in Q1 FY26 from 12.67 percent in Q1 FY25. Maruti Suzuki shares have risen over 16 percent since the beginning of the year.

The last-hour selling came on monthly expiry, dragging the Nifty 50 lower.

For the month of July, Sensex and Nifty lost nearly 3 percent each. The BSE Mid and Smallcap indices shed 0.7 percent each, underperforming the main indices. US President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced 25% tariffs on India and an additional penalty for buying Russian military equipment and oil ahead of the August 1 deadline. In another development, the US Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided to keep interest rates unchanged at 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, with two members were of the opinion that the rate should be trimmed by 25 basis points.

Click to View More Outlook for August 1 Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities Today, the benchmark indices witnessed a volatile trading session from the lower levels, the Nifty ends 86 points lower while the Sensex was down by 296 points. Among Sectors, FMCG Index outperformed, rallied 1.4 percent whereas Oil and Gas, Capital market and Pharma indices shed over 1 percent. Technically, after a gap down open one more time market took the support near 24600/80600 and bounced back sharply. From the day lowest point market rallied over 300 points. However, it failed to close above 24900/81600 levels. Nevertheless, on intraday charts it has formed higher bottom formation which is largely positive. For the day traders now, 24650/80800 and 24600/80600 would act as a key support zones. As long as market is trading above the same, the pullback formation is likely to continue. On the higher side market could move up to 25000/81900 and 25050/82200. On the other side, below 24600/80600 the sentiment could change. Below the same, traders may prefer to exit out from the trading long positions. Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets witnessed volatile swings on the monthly expiry day and ended marginally lower amid mixed cues. The surprise tariff announcement by the US President on India initially triggered a knee-jerk reaction; however, a gradual recovery in heavyweight stocks across sectors helped the index briefly turn positive. Selling pressure resurfaced in the final hours, once again putting bulls on the back foot. As a result, the Nifty closed at 24,768.35, down 0.35%. All major sectors, except FMCG, came under pressure, with pharma, metal, and energy emerging as the top losers. The broader indices also resumed their corrective phase, each losing over a percent. As the new series begins, the market is likely to consolidate, but global developments and corporate earnings will continue to drive volatility. We maintain our cautious stance and recommend a stock-specific approach, given the mixed trends across sectors. Traders should also avoid averaging down on loss-making positions. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The index recovered smartly after a gap-down opening, rising above 24,900. However, the Nifty failed to sustain at higher levels. The index continues to trade below the 50 EMA, confirming a bearish trend. The RSI is in a bearish crossover. Despite several negative setups, a hidden positive divergence has been observed over the past 2–3 days, indicating a potential bullish reversal. This setup may play out well if the Nifty decisively moves above 25,000. On the lower side, support is placed at 24,600. A range-bound movement is expected until the Nifty breaks out of the 24,600–25,000 range.

However, margins remained resilient, with EBITDA margin expanding ~200bp to 15.2% on the back of robust cost controls. Management remains cautious on near-term revenue recovery but expects profitability to improve through the streamlining of backend process and operational efficiencies.

Further, management believes the margin contraction due to improving service levels over the past several quarters is largely behind. Management acknowledged that store additions could have been accelerated in the last few years. While management continues to aim for 10-20% net area additions annually (~14% YoY in FY25), acceleration of store additions is the utmost priority and seen as the best way to tackle the rising competition from Quick Commerce (QC).

Revenue outperformance was driven by continued strong growth in consumer durables—particularly in RAC, despite weak demand faced by RAC players in 1QFY26— as well as sustained growth in the electronics division. AMBER is continuously increasing the share of components in RAC, adding more clients across the AC and overall consumer durables divisions, and focusing on increasing wallet share with clients. This, we believe, will offer sustainable growth in the consumer durable division, despite seasonality in RAC demand. With increased capex, acquisitions in niche electronics areas, and diversification across new segments in electronics, we expect strong growth in the electronics segment to continue. This momentum is expected to be further supported by the commissioning of the company’s capacity in JV with Korea Circuit. We expect the railway segment’s performance to remain subdued in the near term. We increase our estimates by 10%/12% each for FY26/27 to factor in 1QFY26 performance. Reiterate BUY with a revised TP of INR8,950 (INR7,700 earlier). Outlook The stock currently trades at 69.1x/44.3x/30.6x P/E on FY26/27E/28E earnings.

All major Las Vegas Strip casinos are now unionized in historic labor victory,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/all-major-las-vegas-strip-casinos-are-now-unionized-in-historic-labor-victory-2025-08-03/,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — When Susana Pacheco accepted a housekeeping job at a casino on the Las Vegas Strip 16 years ago, she believed it was a step toward stability for her and her 2-year-old daughter. But the single mom found herself exhausted, falling behind on bills and without access to stable health insurance, caught in a cycle of low pay and little support. For years, she said, there was no safety net in sight — until now. For 25 years, her employer, the Venetian, had resisted organizing efforts as one of the last holdouts on the Strip, locked in a prolonged standoff with the Culinary Workers Union. But a recent change in ownership opened the Venetian’s doors to union representation just as the Strip’s newest casino, the Fontainebleau, was also inking its first labor contract. The historic deals finalized late last year mark a major turning point: For the first time in the Culinary Union's 90-year history, all major casinos on the Strip are unionized. Backed by 60,000 members, most of them in Las Vegas, it is the largest labor union in Nevada. Experts say the Culinary Union’s success is a notable exception in a national landscape where union membership overall is declining. “Together, we’ve shown that change can be a positive force, and I’m confident that this partnership will continue to benefit us all in the years to come,"" Patrick Nichols, president and CEO of the Venetian, said shortly after workers approved the deal. Pacheco says their new contract has already reshaped her day-to-day life. The housekeeper no longer races against the clock to clean an unmanageable number of hotel suites, and she’s spending more quality time with her children because of the better pay and guaranteed days off. “Now with the union, we have a voice,” Pacheco said. These gains come at a time when union membership nationally is at an all-time low, and despite Republican-led efforts over the years to curb union power. About 10% of U.S. workers belonged to a union in 2024, down from 20% in 1983, the first year for which data is available, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics. President Donald Trump in March signed an executive order seeking to end collective bargaining for certain federal employees that led to union leaders suing the administration. Nevada and more than two dozen other states now have so-called “right to work” laws that let workers opt out of union membership and dues. GOP lawmakers have also supported changes to the National Labor Relations Board and other regulatory bodies, seeking to reduce what they view as overly burdensome rules on businesses. Ruben Garcia, professor and director of the workplace program at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas law school, said the Culinary Union's resilience stems from its deep roots in Las Vegas, its ability to adapt to the growth and corporatization of the casino industry, and its long history of navigating complex power dynamics with casino owners and operators. He said the consolidation of casinos on the Las Vegas Strip mirrors the dominance of the Big Three automakers in Detroit. A few powerful companies — MGM Resorts International, Caesars Entertainment and Wynn Resorts — now control most of the dozens of casinos along Las Vegas Boulevard. “That consolidation can make things harder for workers in some ways, but it also gives unions one large target,"" Garcia said. That dynamic worked in the union's favor in 2023, when the threat of a major strike by 35,000 hospitality workers with expired contracts loomed over the Strip. But a last-minute deal with Caesars narrowly averted the walkout, and it triggered a domino effect across the Strip, with the union quickly finalizing similar deals for workers at MGM Resorts and Wynn properties. The latest contracts secured a historic 32% bump in pay over the life of the five-year contract. Union casino workers will earn an average $35 hourly, including benefits, by the end of it. The union's influence also extends far beyond the casino floor. With its ability to mobilize thousands of its members for canvassing and voter outreach, the union's endorsements are highly coveted, particularly among Democrats, and can signal who has the best shot at winning working-class votes. The union's path hasn't always been smooth though. Michael Green, a history professor at UNLV, noted the Culinary Union has long faced resistance. “Historically, there have always been people who are anti-union,” Green said. Earlier this year, two food service workers in Las Vegas filed federal complaints with the National Labor Relations Board, accusing the union of deducting dues despite their objections to union membership. It varies at each casino, but between 95 to 98% of workers opt in to union membership, according to the union. “I don’t think Culinary Union bosses deserve my support,” said one of the workers, Renee Guerrero, who works at T-Mobile Arena on the Strip. “Their actions since I attempted to exercise my right to stop dues payments only confirms my decision.” But longtime union members like Paul Anthony see things differently. Anthony, a food server at the Bellagio and a Culinary member for nearly 40 years, said his union benefits — free family health insurance, reliable pay raises, job security and a pension — helped him to build a lasting career in the hospitality industry. “A lot of times it is an industry that doesn't have longevity,"" he said. But on the Strip, it's a job that people can do for “20 years, 30 years, 40 years.” Ted Pappageorge, the union's secretary-treasurer and lead negotiator, said the union calls this the “Las Vegas dream.” “It’s always been our goal to make sure that this town is a union town,"" he said. Before you consider MGM Resorts International, you'll want to hear this.","But on the Strip, it's a job that people can do for “20 years, 30 years, 40 years.” Ted Pappageorge, the union's secretary-treasurer and lead negotiator, said the union calls this the “Las Vegas dream.” “It’s always been our goal to make sure that this town is a union town,"" he said.","But on the Strip, it's a job that people can do for “20 years, 30 years, 40 years.” Ted Pappageorge, the union's secretary-treasurer and lead negotiator, said the union calls this the “Las Vegas dream.” “It’s always been our goal to make sure that this town is a union town,"" he said.","“That consolidation can make things harder for workers in some ways, but it also gives unions one large target,"" Garcia said.","Ruben Garcia, professor and director of the workplace program at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas law school, said the Culinary Union's resilience stems from its deep roots in Las Vegas, its ability to adapt to the growth and corporatization of the casino industry, and its long history of navigating complex power dynamics with casino owners and operators."
"Vietnam automaker Vinfast opens factory in India, eyeing growth in Asia",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/vietnam-automaker-vinfast-to-build-factory-in-india-eyeing-growth-in-asia-2025-08-03/,"THOOTHUKUDI, India (AP) — Vietnam’s Vinfast on Monday began production at a $500 million electric vehicle plant in southern India’s Tamil Nadu state, part of a planned $2 billion investment in India and a broader expansion across Asia. The factory in Thoothukudi will initially make 50,000 electric vehicles annually, with room to triple output to 150,000 cars. Given its proximity to a major port in one of India's most industrialized states, Vinfast hopes it will be a hub for future exports to the region. It says the factory will create more than 3,000 local jobs. The Vietnamese company says it scouted 15 locations across six Indian states before choosing Tamil Nadu. It's the center of India’s auto industry, with strong manufacturing, skilled workers, good infrastructure, and a reliable supply chain, according to Tamil Nadu’s Industries Minister T.R.B. Raaja. “This investment will lead to an entirely new industrial cluster in south Tamil Nadu, and more clusters is what India needs to emerge as a global manufacturing hub,” he said. Vinfast's foray into India reflects a broader shift in strategy. The company increasingly is focusing on Asian markets after struggling to gain traction in the U.S. and Europe. It broke ground last year on a $200 million EV assembly plant in Indonesia, where it plans to make 50,000 cars annually. It's also expanding in Thailand and the Philippines. Vinfast sold nearly 97,000 vehicles in 2024. That's triple what it sold the year before, but only about 10% of those sales were outside Vietnam. As it eyes markets in Asia, it hopes the factory in India will be a base for exports to South Asian countries like Nepal and Sri Lanka and also to countries in the Middle East and Africa. India is the world’s third-largest car market by number of vehicles sold. It presents an enticing mix: A fast growing economy, rising adoption of EVs, supportive government policies and a rare market where players have yet to completely dominate EV sales. “It is a market that no automaker in the world can ignore,” said Ishan Raghav, managing editor of the Indian car magazine autoX. . EV growth in India has been led by two and three-wheelers that accounted for 86% of the over six million EVs sold last year. Sales of four wheel passenger EVs made up only 2.5% of all car sales in India last year, but they have been surging, jumping to more than 110,000 in 2024 from just 1,841 in 2019. The government aims to have EVs account for a third of all passenger vehicle sales by 2030. “The electric car story has started (in India) only three or four years ago,” said Charith Konda, an energy specialist who looks at India’s transport and clean energy sectors for the think-tank Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis or IEEFA. New cars that “look great on the road,” with better batteries, quick charging and longer driving ranges are driving the sector's rapid growth, he said. The shift to EVs is mostly powered by Indian automakers, but Vinfast plans to break into the market later this year with its VF6 and VF7 SUV models, which are designed for India.. Chinese EV brands that dominate in countries like Thailand and Brazil have found India more challenging. After border clashes with China in 2020, India blocked companies like BYD from building their own factories. Some then turned to partnerships. China's SAIC, owner of MG Motor, has joined with India’s JSW Group. Their MG Windsor, a five-seater, sold 30,000 units in just nine months, nibbling Tata Motors’ 70% EV market share down to about 50%. Tata was the first local automaker to court mass-market consumers with EVs. Its 2020 launch of the electric Nexon, a small SUV, became India’s first major EV car success. Vinfast lacks the geopolitical baggage of its larger Chinese rivals and will also benefit from incentives like lower land prices and tax breaks for building locally in India. That's part of India's policy of discouraging imports with high import duties to help encourage local manufacturing and create more jobs. The push for onshore manufacturing is a concern also for Tesla, which launched its Model Y in India last month at a price of nearly $80,000, compared to about $44,990 in the U.S without a federal tax credit. “India’s stand is very clear. We do not want to import manufactured cars, even Teslas. Whether it's Tesla or Chinese cars, they are taxed heavily,” added Konda. The road ahead remains daunting. India’s EV market is crowded with well-entrenched players like Tata Motors and Mahindra, which dominate the more affordable segment, while Hyundai, MG Motors and luxury brands like Mercedes-Benz and Audi compete at high price points. Indians tend to purchase EVs as second cars used for driving within the city, since the infrastructure for charging elsewhere can be undependable. Vinfast will need to win over India's cost-sensitive and conservative drivers with a reputation for quality batteries and services while keeping prices low, said Vivek Gulia, co-founder of JMK Research. “Initially, people will be apprehensive,” he said. Vinfast says it plans to set up showrooms and service centers across India, working with local companies for charging and repairs, and cutting costs by recycling batteries and making key parts like powertrains and battery packs in the country.

Asian markets are mixed after Wall St tumbles following poor US jobs report,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/asian-markets-are-mixed-after-wall-st-tumbles-following-poor-us-jobs-report-2025-08-03/,"BANGKOK (AP) — Shares in Asia are mixed after Wall Street had its worst day since May following the release of weak U.S. jobs data. Markets in Asia had already reacted on Friday to U.S. President Donald Trump’s announcement of sweeping tariffs on imports from many U.S. trading partners, posting moderate losses. The new import duties are set to take effect on Thursday. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index lost 1.6%, bouncing back from bigger losses, to 40,134.97. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong edged 0.2% higher, to 24,589.21, while the Shanghai Composite index was nearly unchanged at 3,562.18. In South Korea, the Kospi surged 0.7% to 3,140.92. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 shed 0.2% to 8,643.00. Investors' worries about a weakening U.S. economy deepened after the latest report on job growth in the U.S. showed employers added just 73,000 jobs in July. That is sharply lower than economists expected. The Labor Department also reported that revisions shaved a stunning 258,000 jobs off May and June payrolls. “The labor market, once a pillar of resilience, is now looking more like a late-cycle casualty, as soft data begin to replace soft landings in market discourse,” Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. U.S. futures edged 0.3% higher, however, early Monday. On Friday, the S&P 500 fell 1.6%, its biggest decline since May 21 and its fourth straight loss. It closed at 6,238.01, posting a 2.4% loss for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.2% to 43,588.58, while the Nasdaq composite fell 2.2% to finish at 20,650.13. Internet retail giant Amazon fell 8.3%, despite reporting encouraging profit and sales for its most recent quarter. Technology behemoth Apple fell 2.5% after also beating Wall Street’s profit and revenue forecasts. Both companies face tougher operating conditions because of tariffs, with Apple forecasting a $1.1 billion hit from the fees in the current quarter. Trump’s decision to order the immediate firing of the head of the government agency that produces the monthly jobs figures raised concern over whether there might be interference in future data. The surprisingly weak hiring numbers led investors to step up their expectations the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates in September. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.21% from 4.39% just before the hiring report was released. That’s a big move for the bond market. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which more closely tracks expectations for Fed actions, plunged to 3.68% from 3.94% just prior to the report’s release. The Fed has held rates steady since December. A cut in rates would give the job market and overall economy a boost, but it could also risk fueling inflation, which is hovering stubbornly above the central bank’s 2% target. An update on Thursday for the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation showed that prices ticked higher in June, rising to 2.6% from 2.4% in May. The Fed held rates steady again at its most recent meeting this week. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has been pressured by Trump to cut the benchmark rate, though that decision isn’t his to make alone, but belongs to the 12 members of the Federal Open Market Committee. Businesses, investors and the Fed have been operating under a cloud of uncertainty from Trump’s tariff policy. Companies have been warning investors that unpredictable policies, with some tariffs already in effect while others change or get extended, make it difficult to plan ahead. Walmart, Procter & Gamble and many others also have warned about import taxes raising costs, eating into profits and raising prices for consumers. In other dealings early Monday, U.S, benchmark crude oil lost 18 cents to $67.15 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 23 cents to $69.44 per barrel. The U.S. dollar rose to 147.80 Japanese yen from 147.26 yen. The euro weakened to $1.1577 from $1.1598.

Somalia's camel milk revolution is improving nutrition and creating jobs,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/somalias-camel-milk-revolution-is-improving-nutrition-and-creating-jobs-2025-08-03/,"MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) — Camels have long been the backbone of Somalia 's pastoralist culture, feeding families, transporting goods and standing tall in local folklore. But on the dusty outskirts of the capital, the camel now finds itself at the center of an agricultural revolution that could redefine Somali farming. On a breezy Wednesday morning in mid-June, The Associated Press visited Beder Camel Farm — one of a new generation of camel dairies springing up around Mogadishu. Dozens of camels sauntered around sandy paddocks while others nibbled on fresh fodder under the watchful eyes of herders. In a nearby shed, workers carefully milked the animals and collected the frothy yield in sanitized containers. Demand for camel milk is growing, buoyed by a wave of local entrepreneurs who see untapped potential in a traditional resource. Somalia is home to over 7 million camels — more than any other country on Earth — but only a fraction of that milk has ever reached urban grocery shelves, according to industry estimates. At the heart of the shift toward a modern approach to camel milk production is Dr. Abdirisak Mire Hashi, a veterinarian and the farm’s manager. For Hashi, it's not only about profit — it's about preserving heritage while embracing progress. “Somalis take pride in their heritage of raising camels. However, the way camels are raised has changed significantly over time,"" Hashi told The Associated Press as he inspected a milking herd. Each camel at Beder now produces up to 10 liters (2.6 gallons) of milk daily — double what traditional herders typically yield. The increase is attributed to new investments in veterinary care, better feed, and modern milking practices. The camels are routinely checked by vets, given nutritional supplements, and grazed on scientifically blended fodder, a far cry from the roaming nomadic herds of decades gone by. “We were among the first to establish this kind of farm back in 2006, when very few people even knew about commercial camel milk production,” said Jama Omar, CEO of Beder Camel Farm. “Other farms have entered the market since then, but we currently hold around 40% of the market share.” “We employ nearly 200 full-time staff,” he added. “In addition, we bring in seasonal workers during key periods such as planting and harvest.” The farm’s biggest leap may be its yogurt factory — the first in Somalia dedicated to processing camel milk into yogurt. Inside the factory, workers in white coats oversee stainless steel vats as fresh milk is cultured and packed. The final product is sold under the Beder brand which now retails in urban supermarkets across Mogadishu. Nelson Njoki Githu, a Kenyan-born food engineer overseeing the production line, says camel milk yogurt isn’t just a novelty — it fills an important nutritional gap for local consumers. “The number one benefit compared to cow milk is that camel milk has lower levels of lactose,” Githu explained. “People with lactose intolerance can consume this milk without any issue. Again, the vitamin levels are higher, especially vitamin C, iron and zinc, compared to cow milk.” For nutritionist Dr. Yahye Sholle, camel milk yogurt is a public health boost in a country where malnutrition remains a challenge. “It is rich in magnesium and calcium, which support bone health. Additionally, it contains vitamins B12, C, and D. It also includes friendly bacteria known as probiotics, which are beneficial for gut health,” he said. Such benefits have helped Beder’s yogurt stand out in Mogadishu’s increasingly competitive dairy market. Hashi said the next step is scaling up the business. He hopes to expand Beder’s network of collection points beyond Mogadishu and plans to train pastoralists in remote areas on modern milking and hygiene practices so that more milk can be safely processed and sold. “If we can modernize how we raise camels and handle the milk, we can create jobs, improve nutrition, and build pride in our own local products,” Hashi said. The Somali government is encouraging more investment in the industry. “The benefits of camel milk are countless,” said Dr. Kasim Abdi Moalim, Director of Animal Health at Somalia’s Ministry of Livestock. “In countries like the UAE, camel milk is also used for cosmetics. Somalia must catch up and develop the full value chain.” He said that government support is growing, with the establishment of a Dairy Act and a strategy for livestock sector development. “A master investment plan is also in progress,” he added. Back at the paddock, a line of camels stretches into the golden afternoon light, their steady, patient footsteps a reminder that progress in Somalia often moves at the pace of tradition — slow but unstoppable. From ancient caravans that crossed deserts to supermarket shelves stocked with yogurt, the Somali camel’s journey continues, one cup at a time. ___ For more on Africa and development: https://apnews.com/hub/africa-pulse The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

China pushes back at US demands to stop buying Russian and Iranian oil,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/china-pushes-back-at-us-demands-to-stop-buying-russian-and-iranian-oil-2025-08-03/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. and Chinese officials may be able to settle many of their differences to reach a trade deal and avert punishing tariffs, but they remain far apart on one issue: the U.S. demand that China stop purchasing oil from Iran and Russia. “China will always ensure its energy supply in ways that serve our national interests,” China's Foreign Ministry posted on X on Wednesday following two days of trade negotiations in Stockholm, responding to the U.S. threat of a 100% tariff. “Coercion and pressuring will not achieve anything. China will firmly defend its sovereignty, security and development interests,"" the ministry said. The response is notable at a time when both Beijing and Washington are signaling optimism and goodwill about reaching a deal to keep commercial ties between the world's two largest economies stable — after climbing down from sky-high tariffs and harsh trade restrictions. It underscores China's confidence in playing hardball when dealing with the Trump administration, especially when trade is linked to its energy and foreign policies. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, emerging from the talks, told reporters that when it comes to Russian oil purchases, the ""Chinese take their sovereignty very seriously.” “We don’t want to impede on their sovereignty, so they would like to pay a 100% tariff,"" Bessent said. On Thursday, he called the Chinese “tough” negotiators, but said China's pushback hasn't stalled the negotiations. “I believe that we have the makings of a deal,” Bessent told CNBC. Gabriel Wildau, managing director of the consultancy Teneo, said he doubts President Donald Trump would actually deploy the 100% tariff. “Realizing those threats would derail all the recent progress and probably kill any chance” for Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to announce a trade deal if they should meet this fall, Wildau said. In seeking to restrict oil sales by Russia and Iran, a major source of revenue for both countries, the U.S. wants to reduce the funding available for their militaries, as Moscow pursues its war against Ukraine and Tehran funds militant groups across the Middle East. When Trump unveiled a sweeping plan for tariffs on dozens of countries in April, China was the only country that retaliated. It refused to give in to U.S. pressure. “If the U.S. is bent on imposing tariffs, China will fight to the end, and this is China’s consistent official stance,” said Tu Xinquan, director of the China Institute for WTO Studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. WTO is the acronym for the World Trade Organization. Negotiating tactics aside, China may also suspect that the U.S. won't follow through on its threat, questioning the importance Trump places on countering Russia, Tu said. Scott Kennedy, senior adviser and trustee chair in Chinese Business and Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Beijing is unlikely to change its posture when it sees inconsistencies in U.S. foreign policy goals toward Russia and Iran, whereas Beijing's policy support for Moscow is consistent and clear. It's also possible that Beijing may want to use it as another negotiating tool to extract more concessions from Trump, Kennedy said. Danny Russel, a distinguished fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said Beijing now sees itself as “the one holding the cards in its struggle with Washington."" He said Trump has made it clear he wants a “headline-grabbing deal” with Xi, “so rejecting a U.S. demand to stop buying oil from Iran or Russia is probably not seen as a deal‑breaker, even if it generates friction and a delay."" Continuing to buy oil from Russia preserves Xi's “strategic solidarity” with Russian President Vladimir Putin and significantly reduces the economic costs for China, Russel said. “Beijing simply can’t afford to walk away from the oil from Russia and Iran,"" he said. “It’s too important a strategic energy supply, and Beijing is buying it at fire‑sale prices.” A 2024 report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that roughly 80% to 90% of the oil exported by Iran went to China. The Chinese economy benefits from the more than 1 million barrels of Iranian oil it imports per day. After the Iranian parliament floated a plan to shut down the Strait of Hormuz in June following U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, China spoke out against closing the critical oil transit route. China also is an important customer for Russia, but is second to India in buying Russian seaborne crude oil exports. In April, Chinese imports of Russian oil rose 20% over the previous month to more than 1.3 million barrels per day, according to the KSE Institute, an analytical center at the Kyiv School of Economics. This past week, Trump said the U.S. will impose a 25% tariff on goods from India, plus an additional import tax because of India’s purchasing of Russian oil. India's Foreign Ministry said Friday its relationship with Russia was “steady and time-tested."" Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff and a top policy adviser, said Trump has been clear that it is “not acceptable” for India to continue financing the Ukraine war by purchasing oil from Russia. “People will be shocked to learn that India is basically tied with China in purchasing Russian oil,” Miller said on Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures.” He said the U.S. needs “to get real about dealing with the financing of this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, is pushing for sanctions and tariffs on Russia and its financial backers. In April, he introduced a bill that would authorize the president to impose tariffs as high as 500% not only on Russia but on any country that “knowingly” buys oil, uranium, natural gas, petroleum products or petrochemical products from Russia. ""The purpose of this legislation is to break the cycle of China — a communist dictatorship — buying oil below market price from Putin’s Russia, which empowers his war machine to kill innocent Ukrainian civilians,” Graham said in a June statement. The bill has 84 co-sponsors in the 100-seat Senate. A corresponding House version has been introduced, also with bipartisan support. Republicans say they stand ready to move on the sanctions legislation if Trump asks them to do so, but the bill is on hold for now. ___ Associated Press writers David McHugh in Frankfurt and Rajesh Roy in New Delhi and researcher Yu Bing in Beijing contributed to the report.

The group met virtually on Sunday and announced that eight of its member countries would increase oil production by 547,000 barrels per day in September. The countries boosting output, including Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria and Oman, had been participating in voluntary production cuts, initially made in November 2023, which were scheduled to be phased out by September 2026. The announcement means the voluntary production cuts will end ahead of schedule. The move follows an OPEC+ decision in July to boost production by 548,000 barrels per day in August. OPEC said the production adjustments may be paused or reversed as market conditions evolve. When production increases, oil and gasoline prices may fall. But Brent crude oil, which is considered a global benchmark, has been trading near $70 per barrel, which could be due to a potential loss of Russian oil on the market and a large rise in crude inventories in China, according to research firm Clearview Energy Partners. “President Trump has not obviously relented from his threat to sanction Russian energy if the Kremlin does not reach a peace deal with Ukraine as of August 7, potentially via “secondary tariffs” on buyers,” Clearview Energy Partners said in an analyst note Sunday.

The film was accompanied by comedies “The Bad Guys 2” and “The Naked Gun"" in the top three box office rankings. The superhero movie dipped significantly more than Marvel's previous film, “Thunderbolts,” which took a 55% dive in its second weekend. “First Steps” is the last major blockbuster of the summer. It added nearly $40 million internationally in its second weekend, bringing thefilm's global total to $369 million. The movie's box office drop off was surprising given its strong reviews, said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for the data firm Comscore. Though the movie’s debut weekend may have given box office results a strong push toward the $4 billion summer benchmark, August is off to a slow start, he said. “It's a tough lift, but we might be able to get there. It really means that all the films are gonna have to stand on their own,” Dergarabedian said. “It’s gonna be about getting great reviews, having that staying power, that longevity in the marketplace.” Newcomer comedy “The Bad Guys 2” earned second place at the box office this weekend, with $22 million from 3,852 North American theaters. That was on par with projections and also in line with the first movie in the series, which brought in $23 million in 2022. Paramount’s slapstick comedy, “The Naked Gun,” also in its debut weekend, snagged the third box office spot, earning $17 million from 3,344 locations. Jim Orr, president of domestic distribution for Universal Pictures, said the solid debut for “The Bad Guys 2,” coupled with strong audience reaction scores, “should point to a very long, very successful run through not only the rest of the summer, but really, I think into the fall."" James Gunn's “Superman,” which opened four weekends ago and already crossed $550 million globally, earned $13.8 million domestically this weekend, taking the fourth spot. “Jurassic World Rebirth” followed with $8.7 million. The horror movie “Together” had a strong debut weekend, coming in at sixth place and earning $6.8 million domestically, proof that August is a month for edgier and off-beat films, Dergarabedian said. “That’s what this month is about. It’s not just about box office,"" Dergarabedian said. ""It’s also about providing really interesting, rewarding movie-going experiences for audiences.” Dergarabedian said he expects highly-anticipated movies hitting theaters in the next few weeks — including “Freakier Friday,” and Zach Cregger’s horror movie “Weapons” — to give August a needed boost.

Aquiles Cubillos, the lead prosecutor in Chile's O'Higgins region, said the body of Moises Pavez, the last miner to remain missing, was found at 3:30 p.m. local time by rescue teams. They had drilled through dozens of meters (feet) of rock to reach the stranded workers. “We deeply regret this outcome” Cubillos said. The five miners were trapped deep inside Chile's El Teniente mine on Thursday after a section of the mine collapsed following a 4.2 magnitude earthquake that instantly killed another miner and injured nine other workers. The trapped miners were located by using GPS devices but rescue teams were not able to communicate with them. Authorities are investigating whether it was a naturally occurring earthquake or whether mining activity at El Teniente caused the tremor. Chilean prosecutors also launched a criminal investigation to determine whether any safety standards were violated. El Teniente, located in the Andes mountains in central Chile, is the world’s largest underground copper mine and is owned by Chilean state company Codelco. Shortly after Thursday’s collapse, Codelco halted operations in the affected section of the mine and evacuated 3,000 people from the broader site to safe areas. The company canceled a presentation of its first-half financial results, set for Friday morning, due to the rescue efforts. Chile, the world’s biggest copper producer, lies in the seismically active “Ring of Fire” that surrounds the shores of the Pacific Ocean. In 2010, Chile's government rescued 33 miners trapped in a copper mine in the country's north for two months in a dramatic operation that made global headlines and was later depicted in a Hollywood movie.","Teradyne's powerful market signal, driven by a durable AI growth engine and confirmed by a forecast for sharply accelerating profitability, makes a compelling case that a new uptrend is underway.","This positions the company as a key beneficiary of the AI build-out, insulating it from the cyclical softness seen in its other markets and creating a durable foundation for growth.",CEO Greg Smith specified that this strength was primarily due to the high demand for testing System-on-a-Chip (SOC) components used in artificial intelligence (AI).,"For investors monitoring the semiconductor industry for a turning point, the message from Teradyne's performance is unmistakable: the rebound is here, and this rally looks like just the beginning."
Why Teradyne's 19% Rally Is Just Getting Started,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/why-teradynes-19-rally-is-just-getting-started/,"The stock market often sends investors subtle hints, but on July 30, 2025, its message about Teradyne, Inc. NASDAQ: TER was loud and clear. Shares of the semiconductor test equipment supplier rose higher, closing the day with a nearly 19% gain. Teradyne’s stock price climb seemed to be a decisive response to the company’s latest earnings report. It is being seen as a signal to investors that, for this critical corner of the industry, the long-awaited turnaround may already be underway. A double-digit price move always turns heads, but the real story behind Teradyne's surge lies in the details. The stock’s rally was powered by a trading volume of nearly 20 million shares, a figure more than five times its daily average. Every day, traders rarely drive this kind of activity; it is a clear footprint of institutional capital. When large investment funds and asset managers move in unison to buy a stock, it signals a fundamental belief in a company's improving prospects. This intense buying pressure was likely amplified by another key market dynamic: short interest. Heading into the earnings report, about 4.3% of Teradyne's publicly available shares were sold short. The sudden and strong price jump, like Wednesday's, can trigger a short squeeze. In this scenario, short-sellers rush to buy shares to cut their losses, which in turn pours more fuel on the rally. This secondary wave of forced buying can help solidify the start of a new, sustained uptrend. When a stock moves this rapidly on such high volume, the market is making a definitive statement. Teradyne's second-quarter 2025 earnings report laid bare the reasons for this confidence. The direct instigator of the rally was Teradyne's second-quarter 2025 financial results, which surpassed analyst expectations with revenue of $652 million and non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $0.57. While these numbers were a welcome surprise, the real story is where the growth came from and what it means for the future. The company's Semiconductor Test segment was the clear driver, accounting for $492 million of the total revenue. CEO Greg Smith specified that this strength was primarily due to the high demand for testing System-on-a-Chip (SOC) components used in artificial intelligence (AI). This detail is critical for investors. The semiconductor industry is known for being cyclical, with demand in markets like automotive and consumer electronics rising and falling with the economy. However, the AI revolution represents a powerful secular trend creating a long-term shift that is less dependent on economic cycles. As AI models become more powerful, the chips that run them become exponentially more complex, packing more transistors and consuming more power. These advanced processors, along with the high-bandwidth memory (HBM) they rely on, require more sophisticated, precise, and expensive testing to ensure they work correctly. Teradyne provides the essential equipment for this process. This positions the company as a key beneficiary of the AI build-out, insulating it from the cyclical softness seen in its other markets and creating a durable foundation for growth. While the second-quarter beat was the spark, the company’s outlook for the future is what poured fuel on the fire. Sophisticated investors focus on where a company is going, not just where it has been. Teradyne's guidance for the third quarter of 2025 provided the most compelling evidence that a business recovery is not just beginning but accelerating. The company's projections for the upcoming quarter signal significant forward momentum: This rapid acceleration in sales and earnings is the clearest financial signal that a cyclical bottom has likely passed. A company does not project this level of growth unless it has strong visibility into future demand. Teradyne’s analyst community is now playing catch-up to this new reality. While the average analyst rating on the stock was a Hold before the report, these ratings are often lagging indicators. The more relevant signals are the post-earnings revisions. Firms like UBS have already raised their price targets to $120, reflecting a belief that the company's prospects have materially improved. The evidence paints a clear and cohesive picture. Teradyne's powerful market signal, driven by a durable AI growth engine and confirmed by a forecast for sharply accelerating profitability, makes a compelling case that a new uptrend is underway. For investors monitoring the semiconductor industry for a turning point, the message from Teradyne's performance is unmistakable: the rebound is here, and this rally looks like just the beginning.

Buy the Dip on 3 Overlooked Names With Major Potential,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/buy-the-dip-on-3-overlooked-names-with-major-potential/,"The S&P 500 has risen steadily since a tumble in early April alongside the Trump administration's major tariff announcement. But returns of more than 8% year-to-date (YTD) after a sharp decline at the start of the second quarter may obscure broad uncertainty in the market. Investors saw this in late July as the benchmark index briefly shuddered in response to the latest Fed decision to maintain interest rates amid sticky inflation and pressure from the president. While the threat of volatility may cause investor skittishness, those with a larger appetite for risk can also find some significant bargains by looking for shares of companies that have fallen in recent periods. Timing the market is always a difficult prospect that involves a fair amount of gambling, but each of the companies below has compelling reasons to expect a potential price increase in the future. Qifu Technology Inc. NASDAQ: QFIN is the company behind the Chinese credit-tech platform 360 Jietiao, which matches customers with funding sources and services, among other offerings. QFIN shares have reached as high as $48 this year but plunged in late July to around 70% of that figure. It's an exciting time for Qifu, share price volatility aside. The firm is in the midst of a major rebranding and strategic shift that will see it re-emerge as Qfin Holdings. The company has also achieved several consecutive quarters of strong year-over-year (YOY) profit growth, including a non-GAAP net income increase of 59.9% in the latest quarter. This was likely driven in large part by the company's 15.8% YOY loan facilitation and origination volume improvement for that period. Qifu has a promising new set of partnerships with mid-to-large municipal banks in China—in recent months, the firm has established three such new partnerships, driving loan volume growth of 144% YOY for the company's technology solutions business. Of course, ongoing trade battles between the United States and China are a potential threat and present a source of uncertainty. Still, the company's profitability and risk management success should help it remain resilient despite external threats. Qifu doesn't have significant analyst attention, but all three firms evaluating QFIN shares have assigned them a Buy rating. Formerly known as Chesapeake, Expand Energy Corp. NASDAQ: EXE is a natural gas producer. Natural gas is well-positioned to benefit from increasing energy demands, particularly in the fast-growing AI and data center spaces. Further, Expand is likely to win out from regulatory changes that will discourage renewables such as wind and solar in the United States in the coming years. Despite a recent mixed earnings report in which Expand massively beat analyst predictions for revenue, $3.7 billion reported against an expected $2.1 billion, while also missing EPS estimates by 4 cents per share, the company's combination of strong production, solid reserves, and analyst optimism could drive growth. Shares of EXE experienced a slight bump in the days following the earnings release, but they remained up only 3% YTD after reaching a one-year high in June. With near-unanimous support from analysts, 20 Buy ratings and just one Hold, and a consensus price target suggesting shares could rise by about 25% from current levels, Expand is an energy stock worth watching. Occupying a niche portion of the aviation industry, FTAI Aviation Ltd. NASDAQ: FTAI is known for leasing aircraft and engines and for its repair and other services. The firm's shares jumped by an astonishing 27% on a single day of trading following an earnings report in which FTAI flipped to profit from losses a year earlier. The company's major EPS beat of 24 cents per share is likely due in large part to its strong aerospace product performance and increased module production. The company has managed to increase revenue by more than 52% in the last year while trimming costs, and guidance suggests double-digit growth could continue into the current quarter as well. It's no surprise that all 13 analyst ratings are Buys, and despite the recent rally, the company is not projected to have 19% upside potential of FTAI shares .

Ukrainian anti-corruption agencies uncover drone procurement graft scheme,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/ukrainian-anti-corruption-agencies-uncover-drone-procurement-graft-scheme-2025-08-03/,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine’s anti-corruption agencies said they had uncovered a major graft scheme involving inflated military procurement contracts, just two days after Ukraine’s parliament voted to restore the agencies’ independence. In a joint statement published Saturday on social media, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SAPO) said the suspects had taken bribes in a scheme that used state funds to buy drones and other military equipment at inflated prices. “The essence of the scheme was to conclude state contracts with supplier companies at deliberately inflated prices,” the statement said, adding that offenders had received kickbacks of up to 30% of the contracts’ value. The anti-corruption bodies did not identify the detainees, but said a Ukrainian lawmaker, local district and city officials, and National Guard servicemen were involved. Four people have been arrested so far, they said. The Interior Ministry said the National Guard personnel implicated in the case were removed from their positions. Drones have become a crucial asset in modern warfare for both Ukraine and Russia, enhancing military reconnaissance, precision strikes, and strategic flexibility on the battlefield. The majority of Russian military assets destroyed by Ukrainian forces, including manpower and heavy weaponry, have been targeted by drones. Drone production is also a key aspect of Kyiv's hopes to expand domestic military production and export markets. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed the development in his nightly address on Saturday, calling the graft scheme “absolutely immoral” and thanking the anti-corruption agencies for their work. “Unfortunately, these corruption schemes involved the procurement of electronic warfare systems and FPV drones ... There must be full and fair accountability for this,” he said in his address, posted to X. In an earlier post, which also included photos of him meeting with the agency heads, Zelenskyy said it is “important that anti-corruption institutions operate independently,” adding that “the law passed on Thursday guarantees them all the tools necessary for a real fight against corruption.” The exposure of the graft scheme by NABU and SAPO came just two days after Ukraine’s parliament voted to restore their independence. Ukraine’s Parliament on Thursday overwhelmingly approved the bill presented by Zelenskyy, reversing his earlier contentious move that curbed their power and sparked a backlash, including street protests, a rarity in wartime. Last week’s measure to place the watchdogs under the oversight of the prosecutor-general prompted rebukes from Ukrainians, the European Union and international rights groups. It raised fears that the government could meddle in investigations and potentially shield its supporters from scrutiny. Fighting entrenched corruption is crucial for Ukraine’s aspirations to join the European Union and maintain access to billions of dollars of vital Western aid in the all-out war, now in its fourth year. It’s also an effort that enjoys broad public support. ___ Morton reported from London.","The controller acknowledged in an interview that the plane’s pilots were never warned when the helicopter was on a collision path, but controllers did not think telling the plane would have made a difference at that point.","The NTSB has also said the FAA failed to recognize a troubling history of 85 near misses around Reagan in the three years before the collision, NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said “every sign was there that there was a safety risk and the tower was telling you that.” But after the accident, the FAA transferred managers out of the airport instead of acknowledging that they had been warned.",But Rick Dressler of medevac operator Metro Aviation told the NTSB that imprecision would not fly with his helicopters.,"The NTSB has also said the FAA failed to recognize a troubling history of 85 near misses around Reagan in the three years before the collision, NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said “every sign was there that there was a safety risk and the tower was telling you that.” But after the accident, the FAA transferred managers out of the airport instead of acknowledging that they had been warned."
"Broken altimeter, ignored warnings: Hearings reveal what went wrong in DC crash that killed 67",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/broken-altimeter-ignored-warnings-hearings-reveal-what-went-wrong-in-dc-crash-that-killed-67-2025-08-02/,"Over three days of sometimes contentious hearings this week, the National Transportation Safety Board interrogated Federal Aviation Administration and Army officials about a list of things that went wrong and contributed to a Black Hawk helicopter and a passenger jet colliding over Washington, D.C., killing 67 people. The biggest revelations: The helicopter's altimeter gauge was broken, and controllers warned the FAA years earlier about the dangers that helicopters presented. At one point NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy scolded the FAA for not addressing safety concerns. “Are you kidding me? Sixty-seven people are dead! How do you explain that? Our bureaucratic process?” she said. “Fix it. Do better.” Victims of the January crash included a group of elite young figure skaters, their parents and coaches and four union steamfitters from the Washington area. Here is a look at the major takeaways from the hearings about the collision, which alarmed travelers before a string of other crashes and close calls this year added to their worries about flying: The helicopter was flying at 278 feet (85 meters) — well above the 200-foot (61-meter) ceiling on that route — when it collided with the airliner. But investigators said the pilots might not have realized that because the barometric altimeter they were relying on was reading 80 to 100 feet (24 to 30 meters) lower than the altitude registered by the flight data recorder. The NTSB subsequently found similar discrepancies in the altimeters of three other helicopters from the same unit. An expert with Sikorsky, which makes the Black Hawks, said the one that crashed was an older model that lacked the air data computers that make for more accurate altitude readings in newer versions. Army Chief Warrant Officer Kylene Lewis told the board that an 80- to 100-foot (24- to 30-meter) discrepancy between the different altimeters on a helicopter would not be alarming, because at lower altitudes she would be relying more on the radar altimeter than the barometric altimeter. Plus Army pilots strive to stay within 100 feet (30 meters) of target altitude on flights, so they could still do that even with their altimeters that far off. But Rick Dressler of medevac operator Metro Aviation told the NTSB that imprecision would not fly with his helicopters. When a helicopter route like the one the Black Hawk was flying that night includes an altitude limit, Dressler said, his pilots consider that a hard ceiling. Both tried to deflect responsibility for the crash, but the testimony highlighted plenty of things that might have been done differently. The NTSB’s final report will be done next year, but there likely will not be one single cause identified for the crash. “I think it was a week of reckoning for the FAA and the U.S. Army in this accident,” aviation safety consultant and former crash investigator Jeff Guzzetti said. Army officials said the greater concern is that the FAA approved routes around Ronald Reagan International Airport with separation distances as small as 75 feet (23 meters) between helicopters and planes when planes are landing on a certain runway at Reagan. “The fact that we have less than 500-foot separation is a concern for me,” said Scott Rosengren, chief engineer in the office that manages the Army’s utility helicopters. Army Chief Warrant Officer David Van Vechten said he was surprised the air traffic controller let the helicopter proceed while the airliner was circling to land at Reagan’s secondary runway, which is used when traffic for the main runway stacks up and accounts for about 5% of flights. Van Vechten said he was never allowed to fly under a landing plane as the Black Hawk did, but only a handful of the hundreds of times he flew that route involved planes landing on that runway. Other pilots in the unit told crash investigators it was routine to be directed to fly under landing planes, and they believed that was safe if they stuck to the approved route. Frank McIntosh, the head of the FAA’s air traffic control organization, said he thinks controllers at Reagan “were really dependent upon the use of visual separation” to keep traffic moving through the busy airspace. The NTSB said controllers repeatedly said they would just “make it work.” They sometimes used “squeeze plays” to land planes with minimal separation. On the night of the crash, a controller twice asked the helicopter pilots whether they had the jet in sight, and the pilots said they did and asked for visual separation approval so they could use their own eyes to maintain distance. Testimony at the hearing raised serious questions about how well the crew could spot the plane while wearing night vision goggles and whether the pilots were even looking in the right spot. The controller acknowledged in an interview that the plane’s pilots were never warned when the helicopter was on a collision path, but controllers did not think telling the plane would have made a difference at that point. The plane was descending to land and tried to pull up at the last second after getting a warning in the cockpit, but it was too late. An FAA working group tried to get a warning added to helicopter charts back in 2022 urging pilots to use caution whenever the secondary runway was in use, but the agency refused. The working group said “helicopter operations are occurring in a proximity that has triggered safety events. These events have been trending in the wrong direction and increasing year over year.” Separately, a different group at the airport discussed moving the helicopter route, but those discussions did not go anywhere. And a manager at a regional radar facility in the area urged the FAA in writing to reduce the number of planes taking off and landing at Reagan because of safety concerns. The NTSB has also said the FAA failed to recognize a troubling history of 85 near misses around Reagan in the three years before the collision, NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said “every sign was there that there was a safety risk and the tower was telling you that.” But after the accident, the FAA transferred managers out of the airport instead of acknowledging that they had been warned. “What you did is you transferred people out instead of taking ownership over the fact that everybody in FAA in the tower was saying there was a problem,” Homendy said. “But you guys are pointing out, ‘Welp, our bureaucratic process. Somebody should have brought it up at some other symposium.’” ___ Associated Press writer Leah Askarinam contributed.","India’s daily oil consumption is pegged around 5.5 million barrels, of which nearly 88% is met through imports.","India bought 68,000 barrels per day of crude oil from Russia in January 2022, but by June of same year oil imports rose to 1.12 million barrels per day.",NEW DELHI (AP) — India has indicated that it would continue buying oil from Russia despite threats by U.S. President Donald Trump.,"Supplies rose as high as nearly 40% of India's imports at one point, making Moscow the largest supplier of crude to New Delhi, the Press Trust of India reported, citing data from Kpler, a data analytics company."
India indicates it will keep buying Russian oil despite Trump's threats,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/india-indicates-it-will-keep-buying-russian-oil-despite-trumps-threats-2025-08-02/,"NEW DELHI (AP) — India has indicated that it would continue buying oil from Russia despite threats by U.S. President Donald Trump. The Indian foreign ministry said its relationship with Russia was “steady and time-tested,” and should not be seen through the prism of a third country. Addressing a weekly presser on Friday, spokesman Randhir Jaiswal said India’s broader stance on securing its energy needs was guided by the availability of oil in the markets and prevailing global circumstances. The comments follow an announcement by President Donald Trump that he intends to impose a 25% tariff on goods from India plus an additional import tax because of New Delhi’s purchases of Russian oil. The threat came as the U.S. president has increasingly soured on Russia for failing to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine and has threatened new economic sanctions if progress is not made. India bought 68,000 barrels per day of crude oil from Russia in January 2022, but by June of same year oil imports rose to 1.12 million barrels per day. The daily imports peaked at 2.15 million in May 2023 and have varied since. Supplies rose as high as nearly 40% of India's imports at one point, making Moscow the largest supplier of crude to New Delhi, the Press Trust of India reported, citing data from Kpler, a data analytics company. India’s daily oil consumption is pegged around 5.5 million barrels, of which nearly 88% is met through imports. The country has historically bought most of its crude from the Middle East, but this has changed since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. India, the world’s third-largest crude importer after China and the U.S., began buying Russian oil available at discounted rates after the West shunned it to punish Moscow.","During that time, you can request a hearing to object by telling the department that the garnishment would cause you financial hardship.","“So you can request assistance from your member of congress — your representative or senator.” Until past due payments are paid or the loan's default status is resolved, borrowers are at risk of having up to 15% of their wages deducted directly from their paychecks.","If that's the case, you should act now to get your loans out of default and back into good standing by either entering a rehabilitation agreement, where you must make nine consecutive payments based on their income, or by consolidating your loans into a new federal Direct Loan.","Here's what to know: “The most important thing borrowers can do before administrative wage garnishment restarts is to log into studentaid.gov to check whether their federal student loans are in default and take steps now to remove them from default,” said Kyra Taylor, staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center."
What to know if you're at risk of having your wages garnished over student loan debt,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/what-to-know-if-youre-at-risk-of-having-your-wages-garnished-over-student-loan-debt-2025-08-02/,"NEW YORK (AP) — Millions of student borrowers could begin having their wages garnished as soon as this summer, according to estimates from credit bureau TransUnion. The company predicts that by August roughly 3 million borrowers could move into default, meaning they're 270 days past due on payments. At that point, loan holders are at risk of having 15% of their pay docked by the government, with the money going toward the outstanding debt. There has been no clear indication of when wage garnishment will start. After the pandemic-era pause on student loan payments ended in May, borrowers have had to reassess the state of their loans and budgets. According to TransUnion, another 2 million borrowers are on course to default in September. A Biden-administration grace period, during which late or missed payments were not counted against credit scores, ended in the fall. Since then, millions of borrowers have seen hits to their credit ratings. Here's what to know: “The most important thing borrowers can do before administrative wage garnishment restarts is to log into studentaid.gov to check whether their federal student loans are in default and take steps now to remove them from default,” said Kyra Taylor, staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center. Taylor said it's not uncommon for borrowers to be unaware that their loans are in default. If borrowers attended college or graduate school during different periods of time, or if they have different federal loan types, they may also have multiple student loan servicers. If that's the case, you should act now to get your loans out of default and back into good standing by either entering a rehabilitation agreement, where you must make nine consecutive payments based on their income, or by consolidating your loans into a new federal Direct Loan. “Because this hasn’t happened for so long, there are many people who have no idea they’re at risk,"" said Aissa Canchola Bañez, policy director at the Student Borrower Protection Center. Wait times for student borrowers attempting to contact their loan servicers have been long, with many dropped calls, in part due to layoffs at the Education Department. Bañez recommends contacting your congressperson, using a casework tool that can guide you through submitting a constituent request. “These offices have entire teams dedicated to constituent casework for when you have an issue with a federal agency, such as the Department of Education,” she said. “So you can request assistance from your member of congress — your representative or senator.” Until past due payments are paid or the loan's default status is resolved, borrowers are at risk of having up to 15% of their wages deducted directly from their paychecks. The Department of Education has sent notices to borrowers warning that tax refunds and wages could be withheld starting this summer if borrowers don’t take steps to restart payments. The department hasn’t yet provided additional information on timing. Richelle Brooks, 37, an education administrator based in Los Angeles, said she's received warnings and notices about the resumption of collection of her loans. For several degrees, she still has $239,000 in outstanding debt, and she was informed her monthly payments on those loans will be roughly $3,000. “I can't afford it,” she said. “We just came out of the moratorium — not paying for five years. People getting these notices — they're terrified. I'm uneasy, too."" Brooks said she's an informed borrower who stays up to date on each development and who knows her options. She plans to enroll in coding classes, at least half-time, which could place her loans in deferment, so she wouldn't be required to make monthly payments, while she makes a financial plan. There's still time to take action. According to Taylor, the Department of Education must provide 30 days notice before it sends a garnishment order to your employer. During that time, you can request a hearing to object by telling the department that the garnishment would cause you financial hardship. You can also request that the department reduce the amount being garnished and submit documentation about your income and expenses. To do this, you must make your hearing request in writing, postmarked no later than 30 days after the garnishment order. Your loan holder will then arrange the hearing. If you're unsure who your loan holder is, you can contact the Education Department's Default Resolution Group. If you were laid off from your last job, you can also object to garnishment if you have not been in your current job for 12 consecutive months. You can further request a hearing and object if you submitted an application for certain kinds of statutory discharges and those have not yet been decided. Some common reasons for statutory discharge of student loans include: if the school you attended closed before you could complete your degree, if your school owes you a refund but fails to pay it, if you're experiencing total disability, or if you're experiencing bankruptcy. “If the borrower requests a hearing within 30 days after receiving the garnishment notice, the department cannot start garnishment until it issues a decision on the borrower’s objections and financial hardship request,” Taylor said. You can request a hearing after the 30 day period is up, but in those cases the department will generally not stop garnishing your wages while the hearing request is pending. ___ The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

"From Laos to Brazil, Trump's tariffs leave a lot of losers. But even the winners will pay a price",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/from-laos-to-brazil-trumps-tariffs-leave-a-lot-of-losers-but-even-the-winners-will-pay-a-price-2025-08-02/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s tariff onslaught this week left a lot of losers – from small, poor countries like Laos and Algeria to wealthy U.S. trading partners like Canada and Switzerland. They’re now facing especially hefty taxes – tariffs – on the products they export to the United States starting Aug. 7. The closest thing to winners may be the countries that caved to Trump's demands — and avoided even more pain. But it's unclear whether anyone will be able to claim victory in the long run — even the United States, the intended beneficiary of Trump’s protectionist policies. “In many respects, everybody’s a loser here,’’ said Barry Appleton, co-director of the Center for International Law at the New York Law School. Barely six months after he returned to the White House, Trump has demolished the old global economic order. Gone is one built on agreed-upon rules. In its place is a system in which Trump himself sets the rules, using America’s enormous economic power to punish countries that won’t agree to one-sided trade deals and extracting huge concessions from the ones that do. “The biggest winner is Trump,” said Alan Wolff, a former U.S. trade official and deputy director-general at the World Trade Organization. “He bet that he could get other countries to the table on the basis of threats, and he succeeded – dramatically.’’ Everything goes back to what Trump calls “Liberation Day’’ – April 2 – when the president announced “reciprocal’’ taxes of up to 50% on imports from countries with which the United States ran trade deficits and 10% “baseline’’ taxes on almost everyone else. He invoked a 1977 law to declare the trade deficit a national emergency that justified his sweeping import taxes. That allowed him to bypass Congress, which traditionally has had authority over taxes, including tariffs — all of which is now being challenged in court. Trump retreated temporarily after his Liberation Day announcement triggered a rout in financial markets and suspended the reciprocal tariffs for 90 days to give countries a chance to negotiate. Eventually, some of them did, caving to Trump’s demands to pay what four months ago would have seemed unthinkably high tariffs for the privilege of continuing to sell into the vast American market. The United Kingdom agreed to 10% tariffs on its exports to the United States — up from 1.3% before Trump amped up his trade war with the world. The U.S. demanded concessions even though it had run a trade surplus, not a deficit, with the UK for 19 straight years. The European Union and Japan accepted U.S. tariffs of 15%. Those are much higher than the low single-digit rates they paid last year — but lower than the tariffs he was threatening (30% on the EU and 25% on Japan). Also cutting deals with Trump and agreeing to hefty tariffs were Pakistan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines. Even countries that saw their tariffs lowered from April without reaching a deal are still paying much higher tariffs than before Trump took office. Angola's tariff, for instance, dropped to 15% from 32% in April, but in 2022 it was less than 1.5%. And while Trump administration cut Taiwan's tariff to 20% from 32% in April, the pain will still be felt. “20% from the beginning has not been our goal, we hope that in further negotiations we will get a more beneficial and more reasonable tax rate,” Taiwan’s president Lai Ching-te told reporters in Taipei Friday. Trump also agreed to reduce the tariff on the tiny southern African kingdom of Lesotho to 15% from the 50% he’d announced in April, but the damage may already have been done there. Countries that didn't knuckle under — and those that found other ways to incur Trump's wrath — got hit harder. Even some poorer countries were not spared. Laos' annual economic output comes to $2,100 per person and Algeria's $5,600 — versus America's $75,000. Nonetheless, Laos got rocked with a 40% tariff and Algeria with a 30% levy. Trump slammed Brazil with a 50% import tax largely because he didn't like the way it was treating former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who is facing trial for trying to lose his electoral defeat in 2022. Never mind that the U.S. has exported more to Brazil than it's imported every year since 2007. Trump's decision to plaster a 35% tariff on longstanding U.S. ally Canada was partly designed to threaten Ottawa for saying it would recognize a Palestinian state. Trump is a staunch supporter of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Switzerland was clobbered with a 39% import tax — even higher than the 31% Trump originally announced on April 2. ""The Swiss probably wish that they had camped in Washington'' to make a deal, said Wolff, now senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. ""They’re clearly not at all happy.’’ Fortunes may change if Trump's tariffs are upended in court. Five American businesses and 12 states are suing the president, arguing that his Liberation Day tariffs exceeded his authority under the 1977 law. In May, the U.S. Court of International Trade, a specialized court in New York, agreed and blocked the tariffs, although the government was allowed to continue collecting them while its appeal wend its way through the legal system, and may likely end up at the U.S. Supreme Court. In a hearing Thursday, the judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit sounded skeptical about Trump's justifications for the tariffs. “If (the tariffs) get struck down, then maybe Brazil’s a winner and not a loser,’’ Appleton said. Trump portrays his tariffs as a tax on foreign countries. But they are actually paid by import companies in the U.S. who try to pass along the cost to their customers via higher prices. True, tariffs can hurt other countries by forcing their exporters to cut prices and sacrifice profits — or risk losing market share in the United States. But economists at Goldman Sachs estimate that overseas exporters have absorbed just one-fifth of the rising costs from tariffs, while Americans and U.S. businesses have picked up the most of the tab. Walmart, Procter & Gamble, Ford, Best Buy, Adidas, Nike, Mattel and Stanley Black & Decker, have all hiked prices due to U.S. tariffs ""This is a consumption tax, so it disproportionately affects those who have lower incomes,'' Appleton said. “Sneakers, knapsacks ... your appliances are going to go up. Your TV and electronics are going to go up. Your video game devices, consoles are going to up because none of those are made in America.’’ Trump’s trade war has pushed the average U.S. tariff from 2.5% at the start of 2025 to 18.3% now, the highest since 1934, according to the Budget Lab at Yale University. And that will impose a $2,400 cost on the average household, the lab estimates. “The U.S. consumer’s a big loser,″ Wolff said. ____ AP Economics Writer Christopher Rugaber contributed to this story.","One way to generate income for investors is with call options on Bitcoin futures ETFs, and that's exactly the play that the NEOS Bitcoin High Income ETF NYSEARCA: BTCI aims for.","One way to generate income for investors is with call options on Bitcoin futures ETFs, and that's exactly the play that the NEOS Bitcoin High Income ETF NYSEARCA: BTCI aims for.","As might be expected for the first-ever Bitcoin fund, BITO has substantially higher AUM and trading volume than BITS above, with about $2.8 billion in invested assets.","With an expense ratio of 0.95%, BITO remains on the higher end of the expense ratio scale for Bitcoin funds, but the fund's strong history, its distributions, and recent performance likely make that a worthwhile fee for many investors."
Bitcoin and Dividends: A Winning Combo in These 3 ETFs,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/bitcoin-and-dividends-a-winning-combo-in-these-3-etfs/,"With Bitcoin trading just below all-time highs, there is fresh attention on the world's first and largest cryptocurrency. Investors concerned about the future of the dollar may also be inclined to turn to crypto, though the space remains highly speculative. If the risk of investing directly in Bitcoin or another major token is too high, an alternative is a cryptocurrency-focused exchange-traded fund (ETF). The most straightforward crypto funds are spot ETFs like the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund NYSEARCA: FBTC. These funds invest directly in Bitcoin and are thus highly risky, although they do provide a layer of protection for investors in that investors don't have to store and transfer crypto holdings by themselves. An income-generating Bitcoin fund may be a better alternative for less risk-tolerant investors. These funds typically use crypto futures, covered calls, and other complex strategies to generate distributions that function similarly to dividend payments made by traditional stocks. Of course, tax implications in these cases may be different, so it's up to the investor to keep track of the implications. One way to generate income for investors is with call options on Bitcoin futures ETFs, and that's exactly the play that the NEOS Bitcoin High Income ETF NYSEARCA: BTCI aims for. This fund invests in exchange-traded products (ETPs) directly exposed to Bitcoin. BTCI is actively managed, meaning that the team from NEOS makes decisions about how and when to utilize call options to maximize distributions while also achieving upside potential. BTCI is one of the newer ETFs in the Bitcoin and crypto space, having only launched late in 2024. However, its track record so far is highly successful; it has returned more than 26% in 2025 alone. This is in addition to monthly distributions, which have provided the fund with a dividend yield of 22.2%. Investors should expect to pay for this fund's active management. BTCI, unsurprisingly, has a fairly high expense ratio of 0.98%. Far cheaper crypto funds are available, but many investors may find the fund's track record and history of distributions to more than make up for the comparably high cost. For a bit more diversification outside of the Bitcoin space, investors might look to the Global X Blockchain & Bitcoin Strategy ETF NASDAQ: BITS. BITS does include a focus on the Bitcoin futures market, but it also aims for exposure to stocks of companies in the blockchain technology and digital assets industries as well as other ETFs focused on blockchain. BITS has traditionally offered investors a distribution twice per year, translating to an annual dividend yield of 24.5%. Considering the fund's substantial payouts and active strategy combining cryptocurrency with traditional stocks and ETFs, the fund's expense ratio of 0.65% is relatively low. Its year-to-date (YTD) return of roughly 18% is likely quite compelling. Investors should be aware, though, that BITS has quite low assets under management (AUM) at just $35.4 million and low trading volume, which may make liquidity a concern for more active traders. The first Bitcoin-related ETF to launch in the United States was the ProShares Bitcoin ETF NYSEARCA: BITO. However, BITO does not invest directly in Bitcoin; instead, it invests in futures and swaps. As might be expected for the first-ever Bitcoin fund, BITO has substantially higher AUM and trading volume than BITS above, with about $2.8 billion in invested assets. Distributions are also a popular draw for BITO investors, as the fund makes monthly payments and has a dividend yield of 49.6%. With an expense ratio of 0.95%, BITO remains on the higher end of the expense ratio scale for Bitcoin funds, but the fund's strong history, its distributions, and recent performance likely make that a worthwhile fee for many investors. BITO has returned about 21% so far this year, far ahead of the broader market.

Profits drop at Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway as it writes down its Kraft Heinz investment,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/profits-drop-at-warren-buffetts-berkshire-hathaway-as-it-writes-down-its-kraft-heinz-investment-2025-08-02/,"OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Warren Buffett's company reported less than half as much profit in the second quarter as it took a $3.76 billion writedown on the value of its stake in Kraft Heinz, as that iconic food producer considers largely undoing the merger that Berkshire Hathaway helped bankroll. Berkshire said it earned $12.37 billion, or $8,601 per Class A share, during the quarter. That's down from $30.248 billion, or $21,122 per Class A share, a year ago, because it recorded a much smaller paper investment gain this year. Berkshire's earnings can swing wildly from quarter to quarter because it has to record the current value of its massive investment portfolio even though it doesn't sell most of the stocks. That's why Buffett has long recommended that investors pay more attention to Berkshire's operating earnings, which exclude those investment gains. Although last year Berkshire did surprise shareholders by selling off a huge chunk of its Apple stake which inflated the investment gains then. By that measure, Berkshire's operating earnings were only down slightly at $11.16 billion, or $7,759.58 per Class A share. That compares with $11.598 billion, or $8,072.16 per Class A share, a year ago. Most of Berkshire's myriad assortment of companies — major insurers like Geico, BNSF railroad, a group of utilities and a collection of manufacturing and retail businesses — generally performed well despite the uncertainty about the economy and President Donald Trump's tariffs. The four analysts surveyed by FactSet Research expected Berkshire to report earnings per Class A share of $7,508.10, so the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate's results were ahead of that. Berkshire owns more than 27% of Kraft Heinz' stock and, for years, it had representatives on the company's board. Buffett has said previously that he believes the company's iconic brands will do well over time, but in hindsight, he overpaid for the investment and underestimated the challenges branded foods face from retailers and the growth of private label products. This spring, Berkshire's representatives resigned from the Kraft Heinz board shortly before the company announced it is exploring strategic options that may include spinning off a large part of its portfolio of brands. Over the years since Berkshire helped Kraft buy Heinz in 2015, the company has been hurt by changing consumer tastes and a shift toward healthier options than Kraft’s core collection of processed foods. Another writedown could be coming in the future because CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert pointed out that Berkshire's holding of 28% of Occidental Petroleum's stock, which is currently valued at about $5.3 billion less than the $16.5 billion that Buffett paid for it. Buffett's is still sitting on a massive pile of $344.1 billion in cash, although the company's reserves dipped slightly from the $347.7 billion cash it was holding at the end of the first quarter. Buffett told shareholders in May he just isn't finding any attractive deals for companies he understands. Buffett surprised shareholders at the annual meeting when he announced that he plans to give up the CEO title at the end of the year and hand over operations to Vice Chairman Greg Abel, but Buffett will remain Chairman. Berkshire shareholders might be disappointed that the company didn't repurchase any of its shares this quarter, even though the price has fallen more than 12% since just before Buffett announced his retirement. But investor Chris Ballard, who is managing director at Check Capital, said he wasn't surprised at the lack of buybacks because even after the recent drop, Berkshire's stock is still selling at a premium compared to the value of its businesses. Many investors are watching Berkshire's BNSF closely after rival Union Pacific announced a plan to buy Norfolk Southern earlier this week to create the nation's first transcontinental railroad. The speculation is that BNSF needs to pursue a merger with eastern rail CSX to be able to compete. But Seifert said it isn't Buffett's style to jump into a deal just because the market thinks he should. Over the decades, he has built Berkshire by finding strong companies selling for less than they are worth. CSX is trading near its 52-week high at $35.01 amid all the deal speculation. “He wants to do it because he found an undervalued franchise -- not because the market says you need to do a deal,” Seifert said. “I think one of the reasons why that cash hasn’t been deployed is that valuations run through the Berkshire M-and-A model tend to be too rich. But if there’s a logical case to be made they’ll accept it.” And BNSF appears to be doing fine right now on its own. The railroad recorded a 19% jump in its operating profit this quarter at $1.47 billion as it cut costs and delivered about 1% more shipments. Berkshire's insurance results disappointed a bit as it appeared the company might be pulling back from writing as much property insurance at a time when premiums aren't as attractive. Even in areas where it is growing, like Geico, Seifert said Berkshire lagged behind peers such as Progressive and Allstate. Berkshire normally pulls back on writing insurance when it doesn't like the premiums. “The insurance business has struggled a bit. I would say the takeaways for me is on that front, they’re doing less property and casualty insurance,” said Ballard, who's firm counts Berkshire as its largest holding. Berkshire said it's underwriting operating profit dipped to just below $2 billion in the quarter from last year's $2.26 billion.","For investors, this new demand is the engine of future profit.","A clear signal of shifting sentiment appeared on July 25, when the trading volume of bullish call options for PG&E stock soared by over 380% compared to its daily average.","Confirmed projects with major tech players like Microsoft NASDAQ: MSFT make this growth feel tangible and imminent, positioning PG&E as a key partner in the AI economy.","A call option gives an investor the right to buy a stock at a specific price in the future, making it a direct bet on a price increase."
Is PG&E an AI Power Play? Why Options Traders Are Betting Big,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/is-pg-and-e-an-ai-power-play-why-options-traders-are-betting-big/,"Utility stocks are typically known for their predictability, not for explosive growth. It is especially noteworthy, then, when market indicators begin flashing for one of the utility sector’s most-watched companies. For Pacific Gas & Electric NYSE: PCG, a dramatic, recent spike in bullish activity suggests some professional investors believe the company is at a major inflection point. This unusual interest warrants a deeper look into the fundamental drivers that could be fueling a powerful turnaround, one that links the future of California's power grid to the global boom in artificial intelligence (AI). A clear signal of shifting sentiment appeared on July 25, when the trading volume of bullish call options for PG&E stock soared by over 380% compared to its daily average. A call option gives an investor the right to buy a stock at a specific price in the future, making it a direct bet on a price increase. A surge of this magnitude signals a wave of new confidence. A closer look at the trading data shows significant interest in options expiring in September 2025 with ""strike prices"" of $16, $19, and $20 per share. With PG&E’s stock price currently trading in the 13-14 range, this pattern reveals that investors are positioning for a sustained rally. They are betting on a potential upside of 20% to 50% over the coming months, which raises a critical question: What fundamentals justify such optimism? The justification for this bullish sentiment is found in the company's second-quarter 2025 earnings report. The results paint a picture of a business that is successfully stabilizing its operations and finances. The company confidently reaffirmed its full-year non-GAAP core earnings per share (EPS) guidance of $1.48 to $1.52. This signals that management's plan is on track, providing the predictability investors value. This stability is built on a foundation of tangible operational achievements that reduce risk. The company is also managing its regulatory environment more proactively. It recently submitted its smallest rate increase request in a decade. While legislative debates in Sacramento remain a key watch item, earnings call that the company's $63 billion, five-year financial plan can withstand various outcomes, CEO Patti Poppe stated on the call without diluting shareholder value by issuing new stock at current prices. While a stable foundation is essential, the catalyst igniting genuine investor excitement is a powerful, new growth engine. PG&E’s earnings report revealed that demand for its new data center pipeline has swelled to an immense 10 gigawatts. This surge is a direct result of the artificial intelligence revolution centered in PG&E’s Northern California service area. The massive server farms required for AI development consume vast amounts of electricity, giving PG&E a unique growth opportunity that most other utilities lack. For investors, this new demand is the engine of future profit. Meeting this demand will require billions in new infrastructure investment. For a regulated utility, these capital investments are added to its rate base, which is the core asset portfolio on which the company earns a guaranteed profit. This growth in the rate base directly supports the company's goal of delivering at least 9% annual EPS growth through 2028. This growth story also presents a winning narrative for customers and regulators. As management explained, every gigawatt of new data center load can reduce residential bills by 1-2%, as the grid's high fixed costs are spread over more sales. Confirmed projects with major tech players like Microsoft NASDAQ: MSFT make this growth feel tangible and imminent, positioning PG&E as a key partner in the AI economy. The recent surge in bullish options trading appears to be a rational market signal indicating PG&E's fundamental transformation. The company is successfully moving beyond its recovery phase by stabilizing its operations and proactively managing its risks. More importantly, it has secured a robust, long-term growth catalyst by positioning itself as the energy backbone for the AI industry. For a company long defined by its past challenges, the narrative is compellingly shifting to one of durable, technology-driven growth.

MarketBeat Week in Review – 07/28 - 08/01,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/marketbeat-week-in-review-07-28-08-01/,"Stocks drifted lower to end the week as economic uncertainty overshadowed strong Magnificent Seven earnings. On July 31, the latest Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index showed a slight uptick in the rate of inflation growth. Then on Friday, the August Jobs report came in lighter than expected. However, that number looked bullish compared with massive downward revisions to the May and June numbers. Investors are also weighing the impact of tariffs now that the August 1 deadline has come and gone. On a more bullish note, reports from several mega-cap technology companies reinforce the reality of the artificial intelligence (AI) trade. Many of these companies will spend billions of dollars over several years to build out an AI infrastructure, creating opportunities in several sectors. Next week will be quieter for economic data, but earnings season will continue to roll along. August itself is typically a quiet week for markets. But that low volume can also lead to high volatility. Count on the MarketBeat analysts to help you separate market signals from noise. Here are some of our most popular articles from this week. Articles by Sam Quirke One week after its earnings report, Tesla Inc. NASDAQ: TSLA stock has given up almost all of its post-earnings gains. However, Sam Quirke pointed out why the long-term upside continues to look bullish as Tesla’s robotics and autonomous vehicle solutions begin to emerge. Amazon.com Inc. NASDAQ: AMZN stock dropped despite a solid earnings report. It’s just one example of how investors had priced growth into the company’s results. Quirke explained the long-term bull case and how investors and traders may want to approach the stock. NVIDIA Corp. NASDAQ: NVDA would appear to be a winner as AI spending shows no signs of slowing down. Quirke pointed to two technical indicators that look bearish for NVDA stock despite continued optimism from analysts. Articles by Chris Markoch Palantir Technologies Inc. NASDAQ: PLTR reports earnings next week. Chris Markoch explained why investors will want to pay close attention to the company’s growing defense business as the company becomes the Pentagon’s go-to AI engine. Stocks that form a golden cross pattern can be opportunities for investors. Markoch highlighted three stocks that have recently made a golden cross that is supported by strong fundamentals. Apple Inc. NASDAQ: AAPL delivered a strong earnings report on July 31. However, AAPL stock is delivering muted gains. Markoch explained why investors are skeptical about the sustainability of the company’s results, and what that may mean for a stock that many believe is still priced for perfection. Articles by Ryan Hasson Bitcoin has made a resurgence in July, and this time it’s bringing other tokens with it. This week, Ryan Hasson looked at five stocks set to ride the wave of the crypto surge that investors can own without owning and storing the digital assets. Autonomous technology is the bullish cousin to artificial intelligence. This week, Hasson looked at this sector and provided investors with five autonomous technology stocks trading for less than $15. That means there’s some risk and the potential for outsized gains for patient investors. Hasson also looked at two cybersecurity stocks that are poised for a breakout. As interest in AI continues to grow, so will the threats from AI-driven cyberattacks. Hasson explained why upcoming earnings may be the catalyst that moves these stocks higher. Articles by Gabriel Osorio-Mazilli This week, Gabriel Osorio-Mazilli analyzed the surge in American Eagle Outfitters Inc. NYSE: AEO. More importantly, he looked beyond the noise and explained why the move in AEO stock may have more behind it than speculation. With so many stocks trading at or near all-time highs, it can be hard to find undervalued stocks. However, that’s exactly what Osorio-Mazilli did this week. Not only did he provide investors with the names of three undervalued stocks, but he also pointed out why each has catalysts that the market may be overlooking. Buy-and-hold investors understand the importance of compounding. This week, Osorio-Mazilli pointed these investors to three stocks with attractive outlooks for compounding for years to come. Articles by Leo Miller Investors expected a strong earnings report from Meta Platforms Inc. NASDAQ: META, and the company did not disappoint. Leo Miller summarized the tech giant's strong report and explained why investors should be willing to chase META stock higher. Earnings season is a time when investors seek out analyst upgrades. This week, Miller highlighted three AI stocks that have received bullish upgrades after reporting strong earnings. Earnings season can also be synonymous with stock buybacks. Although that hasn’t been a prominent factor so far in this cycle, Miller highlighted four stocks that have announced significant increases in Q2 buybacks. Articles by Nathan Reiff D-Wave Quantum Inc. NYSE: QBTS has been one of the best-performing stocks in the emerging quantum stock sector. This week, Nathan Reiff pointed out the catalysts that briefly allowed QBTS stock to make a new all-time high, but why investors may still want to proceed with caution. Investors have been waiting for basic materials stocks to take off. However, uncertainty in key economic indicators has weighed on these stocks. Reiff explained why three material stocks are likely to have further upside based on fundamentals and market trends. Defense stocks have been some of the most closely watched stocks for investors. Reiff pointed out why a beaten-down small-cap stock, Byrna Technologies Inc. NASDAQ: BYRN, is one to watch based on bullish analyst sentiment and a strong earnings report. Articles by Dan Schmidt History frequently rhymes, and Dan Schmidt pointed out why 2025 is starting to look a lot like 2021. In both cases, traders were looking for short squeeze candidates. This is a risky strategy, but it can be profitable. Schmidt highlighted three stocks with catalysts that could make them good short-squeeze candidates. It hasn’t been all bad news on the tariff front, Schmidt pointed out why the recent deal between the United States and Japan is bullish for automotive stocks. Schmidt highlighted three automaker stocks that investors may be overlooking. Articles by Jeffrey Neal Johnson “The quantum computing industry is reaching an inflection point.” Jeffrey Neal Johnson highlighted this issue for investors. Johnson explained the key factors driving quantum stocks higher and gave investors three stocks that are among the most promising for long-term investors. Drone stocks have been soaring, which is why Johnson made it a point to highlight Red Cat Holdings Inc. NASDAQ: RCAT. The stock has dropped recently, but a new contract is only one reason why analysts believe there’s significant upside to come. As the AI revolution progresses, investors will want to watch applications on the edge. This week, Johnson pointed out that its application of semiconductors in automotive and internet of Things (IoT) applications makes Qualcomm Inc. NASDAQ: QCOM a growth stock that may be flying under the radar. Articles by Jordan Chussler Healthcare is normally an evergreen sector for investors. However, that hasn’t been the case for several years. Jordan Chussler analyzed the headwinds impacting the healthcare sector and why that adds to the bullish case for HCA Healthcare Inc. NYSE: HCA, which recently issued bullish forward guidance.

(AP) — SpaceX delivered a fresh crew to the International Space Station on Saturday, making the trip in a quick 15 hours. The four U.S., Russian and Japanese astronauts pulled up in their SpaceX capsule after launching from NASA's Kennedy Space Center. They will spend at least six months at the orbiting lab, swapping places with colleagues up there since March. SpaceX will bring those four back as early as Wednesday. Moving in are NASA's Zena Cardman and Mike Fincke, Japan's Kimiya Yui and Russia's Oleg Platonov — each of whom had been originally assigned to other missions. “Hello, space station!” Fincke radioed as soon as the capsule docked high above the South Pacific.

It's Trump's economy now. The latest financial numbers offer some warning signs,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/its-trumps-economy-now-the-latest-financial-numbers-offer-some-warning-signs-2025-08-01/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — For all of President Donald Trump’s promises of an economic “golden age,” a spate of weak indicators this week told a potentially worrisome story as the impacts of his policies are coming into focus. Job gains are dwindling. Inflation is ticking upward. Growth has slowed compared with last year. More than six months into his term, Trump’s blitz of tariff hikes and his new tax and spending bill have remodeled America’s trading, manufacturing, energy and tax systems to his own liking. He’s eager to take credit for any wins that might occur and is hunting for someone else to blame if the financial situation starts to totter. But as of now, this is not the boom the Republican president promised, and his ability to blame his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden, for any economic challenges has faded as the world economy hangs on his every word and social media post. When Friday’s jobs report turned out to be decidedly bleak, Trump ignored the warnings in the data and fired the head of the agency that produces the monthly jobs figures. “Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can’t be manipulated for political purposes,” Trump said on Truth Social, without offering evidence for his claim. “The Economy is BOOMING.” It’s possible that the disappointing numbers are growing pains from the rapid transformation caused by Trump and that stronger growth will return — or they may be a preview of even more disruption to come. Trump's aggressive use of tariffs, executive actions, spending cuts and tax code changes carries significant political risk if he is unable to deliver middle-class prosperity. The effects of his new tariffs are still several months away from rippling through the economy, right as many Trump allies in Congress will be campaigning in the midterm elections. “Considering how early we are in his term, Trump’s had an unusually big impact on the economy already,” said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist at Firehouse Strategies. “The full inflationary impact of the tariffs won’t be felt until 2026. Unfortunately for Republicans, that’s also an election year.” The White House portrayed the blitz of trade frameworks leading up to Thursday's tariff announcement as proof of his negotiating prowess. The European Union, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Indonesia and other nations that the White House declined to name agreed that the U.S. could increase its tariffs on their goods without doing the same to American products. Trump simply set rates on other countries that lacked settlements. The costs of those tariffs — taxes paid on imports to the U.S. — will be most felt by many Americans in the form of higher prices, but to what extent remains uncertain. “For the White House and their allies, a key part of managing the expectations and politics of the Trump economy is maintaining vigilance when it comes to public perceptions,” said Kevin Madden, a Republican strategist. Just 38% of adults approve of Trump’s handling of the economy, according to a July poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs. That’s down from the end of Trump’s first term when half of adults approved of his economic leadership. The White House paints a rosier image, seeing the economy emerging from a period of uncertainty after Trump’s restructuring and repeating the economic gains seen in his first term before the pandemic struck. “President Trump is implementing the very same policy mix of deregulation, fairer trade, and pro-growth tax cuts at an even bigger scale – as these policies take effect, the best is yet to come,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said. The economic numbers over the past week show the difficulties that Trump might face if the numbers continue on their current path: — Friday's jobs report showed that U.S. employers have shed 37,000 manufacturing jobs since Trump's tariff launch in April, undermining prior White House claims of a factory revival. — Net hiring has plummeted over the past three months with job gains of just 73,000 in July, 14,000 in June and 19,000 in May — a combined 258,000 jobs lower than previously indicated. On average last year, the economy added 168,000 jobs a month. — A Thursday inflation report showed that prices have risen 2.6% over the year that ended in June, an increase in the personal consumption expenditures price index from 2.2% in April. Prices of heavily imported items, such as appliances, furniture, and toys and games, jumped from May to June. — On Wednesday, a report on gross domestic product — the broadest measure of the U.S. economy — showed that it grew at an annual rate of less than 1.3% during the first half of the year, down sharply from 2.8% growth last year. “The economy's just kind of slogging forward,” said Guy Berger, senior fellow at the Burning Glass Institute, which studies employment trends. “Yes, the unemployment rate’s not going up, but we’re adding very few jobs. The economy’s been growing very slowly. It just looks like a ‘meh’ economy is continuing.” Trump has sought to pin the blame for any economic troubles on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, saying the Fed should cut its benchmark interest rates even though doing so could generate more inflation. Trump has publicly backed two Fed governors, Christoper Waller and Michelle Bowman, for voting for rate cuts at Wednesday's meeting. But their logic is not what the president wants to hear: They were worried, in part, about a slowing job market. But this is a major economic gamble being undertaken by Trump and those pushing for lower rates under the belief that mortgages will also become more affordable as a result and boost homebuying activity. His tariff policy has changed repeatedly over the last six months, with the latest import tax numbers serving as a substitute for what the president announced in April, which provoked a stock market sell-off. It might not be a simple one-time adjustment as some Fed board members and Trump administration officials argue. Of course, Trump can't say no one warned him about the possible consequences of his economic policies. Biden, then the outgoing president, did just that in a speech last December at the Brookings Institution, saying the cost of the tariffs would eventually hit American workers and businesses. “He seems determined to impose steep, universal tariffs on all imported goods brought into this country on the mistaken belief that foreign countries will bear the cost of those tariffs rather than the American consumer,” Biden said. “I believe this approach is a major mistake.”","William Beach, who was appointed BLS commissioner in 2019 by Trump and served until 2023 during President Joe Biden's administration, called McEntarfer's firing “groundless” and said in an X post that it “sets a dangerous precedent and undermines the statistical mission of the Bureau.” Former Labor Department chief economist Sarah J.

"Who is Erika McEntarfer, the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner fired by Trump?",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/who-is-erika-mcentarfer-the-bureau-of-labor-statistics-commissioner-fired-by-trump-2025-08-01/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The head of the agency that compiles the closely watched monthly jobs report usually toils in obscurity, but on Friday, the current holder of that job was loudly fired by the president of the United States. Erika McEntarfer, a longtime government employee, bore the brunt of President Donald Trump’s unhappiness with Friday’s jobs report, which showed that hiring had slowed in July and was much less in May and June that previously estimated. He accused her without evidence of manipulating the job numbers and noted she was an appointee of President Joe Biden. McEntarfer, a longtime government worker who had served as BLS head for a year and a half, did not immediately respond to a request for comment by The Associated Press. But her predecessor overseeing the jobs agency, former co-workers and associates have denounced the firing, warning about its repercussions and saying McEntarfer was nonpolitical in her role. Here’s what to know about Erika McEntarfer: McEntarfer, whose research focuses on job loss, retirement, worker mobility, and wage rigidity, had previously worked at the Census Bureau’s Center for Economic Studies, the Treasury Department’s Office of Tax Policy and the White House Council of Economic Advisers in a nonpolitical role. She has a bachelor's degree in Social Science from Bard College and a doctoral degree in economics from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. McEntarfer was nominated in 2023 to serve as BLS head, and the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions recommended that her nomination go to the full Senate for a vote. She was confirmed as BLS commissioner in January 2024 on a bipartisan 86-8 Senate vote. Among the Republican senators who voted to confirm her included then-Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, who is now Trump's vice president, and then-Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who is now Trump's secretary of state. Before her confirmation hearing, a group called the Friends of the BLS, made up of former commissioners who served in both Democratic and Republican administrations, members of statistical associations and credentialed economists, said McEntarfer's background made her a great choice for the job. “The many reasons to quickly confirm Dr. McEntarfer as the new BLS Commissioner all boil down to this: the agency, like the entire statistical system, is undergoing an intense, significant period of change and Dr. McEntarfer’s wealth of research and statistical experience have equipped her to be the strong leader that BLS needs to meet these challenges,” Friends of the BLS wrote. William Beach, who was appointed BLS commissioner in 2019 by Trump and served until 2023 during President Joe Biden's administration, called McEntarfer's firing “groundless” and said in an X post that it “sets a dangerous precedent and undermines the statistical mission of the Bureau.” Former Labor Department chief economist Sarah J. Glynn, who received regular briefings from McEntarfer about BLS findings, said McEntarfer was generous with her time explaining what conclusions could or couldn’t be reached from the data. If the data didn’t support something an administration official was saying, McEntarfer would say so, Glynn said. She also never weighed in on how the administration should present or interpret the data, Glynn said — she would simply answer questions about the data. “She had a sterling reputation as someone who is concerned about the accuracy of the data and not someone who puts a political spin on her work,” Glynn said. Heather Boushey, a senior research fellow at Harvard University, served with McEntarfer on the White House Council of Economic Advisers and said McEntarfer never talked politics at work. “She showed up every day to focus on the best analysis and the best approach to her field and not get political. That is what I saw from her time and again. She is brilliant and well-respected among labor economists generally,” Boushey said. “She wasn’t coming into my office to talk politics or the political implications of something. She definitely wasn’t engaging on that side of things.” ___ Olson reported from New York.

"American Eagle responds to critics over ad with Sydney Sweeney, saying it was always about the jeans",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/american-eagle-responds-to-critics-over-ad-with-sydney-sweeney-saying-it-was-always-about-the-jeans-2025-08-01/,"NEW YORK (AP) — Teen retailer American Eagle Outfitters has a message to its critics, who took issue over its denim ad campaign with 27-year-old actor Sydney Sweeney that sparked a debate over race and Western beauty standards. The campaign, the retailer said, was always about the jeans. In a statement posted on American Eagle's Instagram account on Friday, the retailer said the ad campaign “is and always was about the jeans. Her jeans. Her story. We'll continue to celebrate how everyone wears their AE jeans with confidence, their way. Great jeans look good on everyone.” The message marked the first time the teen retailer responded to days of backlash since the ad with the tagline “Sydney Sweeney has great jeans” launched last week. In the run-up to the ad blitz, the company's chief marketing officer told trade media outlets that it included “clever, even provocative language” and was “definitely going to push buttons."" It's unclear if the company knew how much controversy the ad could raise. Most of the negative reception focused on videos that used the word “genes” instead of “jeans” when discussing the blonde-haired, blue-eyed actor known for the HBO series “Euphoria” and “White Lotus.” Critics found the most troubling was a teaser video in which Sweeney says, “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color. My jeans are blue.” The video appeared on American Eagle’s Facebook page and other social media channels but is not part of the ad campaign. Some critics saw the wordplay as a nod, either unintentional or deliberate, to eugenics, a discredited theory that held humanity could be improved through selective breeding for certain traits. Other commenters accused detractors of reading too much into the campaign’s message. Some marketing experts said the buzz is always good even if it’s not uniformly positive. “If you try to follow all the rules, you’ll make lots of people happy, but you’ll fail,” Allen Adamson, co-founder of marketing consultancy Metaforce said. “The rocket won’t take off.” Before you consider Meta Platforms, you'll want to hear this.","NEW YORK (AP) — Prices as of 5:30:00 PM Friday, August 01.","Estimated volume: 32,646 Thursday's volume: 24,215 Open Interest: 84,905 Open Interest Change: -51985","NEW YORK (AP) — Prices as of 5:30:00 PM Friday, August 01.",Nikkei 225 (Yen) (CME) 500 yen x Nikkei 225 YEN futures price.

"Columbia Sportswear sues Columbia University, alleging merchandise too similar and causes confusion",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/columbia-sportswear-sues-columbia-university-alleging-merchandise-too-similar-and-causes-confusion-2025-08-01/,"NEW YORK (AP) — Outerwear retailer Columbia Sportswear has sued Columbia University over alleged trademark infringement and a breach of contract, saying that the university’s merchandise looks too similar to its own offerings and can confuse shoppers. In a lawsuit filed July 23 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon, Columbia Sportswear, whose roots date back to 1938, alleges that the Ivy League university intentionally violated an agreement the parties signed on June 13, 2023. That agreement dictated how the university could use the word “Columbia” on its own apparel and accessories. As part of the pact, the university could feature “Columbia” on its merchandise provided that the name included a recognizable school insignia or its mascot, the word “university,” the name of the academic department or the founding year of the university — 1754 — or a combination. Columbia Sportswear clothing is sold at more than 800 retail locations including more than 150 of its branded stores as well as its website and third-party marketplaces. But Columbia Sportswear alleges the university breached the agreement a little more than a year later, with the Portland, Oregon-based company noticing several garments without any of the school logos being sold at the Columbia University online store. Many of the garments feature a bright blue color that is “confusingly similar” to the blue color that has long been associated with Columbia Sportswear, the suit alleged. The lawsuit offered photos of some of the Columbia University items that say only Columbia. “The likelihood of deception, confusion, and mistake engendered by the university’s misappropriation and misuse of the Columbia name is causing irreparable harm to the brand and goodwill symbolized by Columbia Sportswear’s registered mark Columbia and the reputation for quality it embodies,” the lawsuit alleged. The lawsuit comes at a time when Columbia University has been threatened with the potential loss of billions of dollars in government support. Last week, Columbia University reached a deal with the Trump administration to pay more than $220 million to the federal government to restore federal research money that was canceled in the name of combating antisemitism on campus. Under the agreement, the Ivy League school will pay a $200 million settlement over three years, the university said. Columbia Sportswear aims to stop all sales of clothing that violate the agreement, recall any products already sold and donate any remaining merchandise to charity. Columbia Sportswear is also seeking three times the amount of actual damages determined by a jury. Neither Columbia Sportswear nor Columbia University could be immediately reached for comment.",LexRankSummary,nan,nan,nan
