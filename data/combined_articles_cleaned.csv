"Real estate stocks jump up to 3%, extend gains for 4th day: What's driving the rally?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/real-estate-stocks-jump-up-to-3-extend-gains-for-4th-day-what-s-driving-the-rally-13474728.html,"The shares of real estate companies recorded notable gains on August 21, buoyed by multiple factors. The sharp rise in the share prices pushed the Nifty Realty index up over 1 percent to hover around 923 in the morning. The realty index has now extended gains for the fourth consecutive session. Here are the likely triggers pushing the real estate stocks up: 'Listed developers are well-positioned for sustained growth': Listed residential developers delivered their strongest-ever quarter in Q1 of the financial year 2026, said Pankaj Kumar, VP-Fundamental Research, Kotak Securities. ""With a robust ~Rs 1.8 lakh crore launch pipeline, strong balance sheets, and low leverage, listed developers are well-positioned for sustained growth and market share gains. Valuations for most residential real estate stocks stand at 7-10X adjusted EV/EBITDA (FY27E). Despite moderating industry volume trends, we remain constructive on listed developers, driven by geographical expansion and market share gains,"" he added. Kotak Securities named DLF, Brigade Enterprises, Lodha, and Prestige Estates as its preferred picks in the sector. Rate cut expectations: The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) kept its repo rate unchanged during the last meeting in August. Repo rates directly influence home loan interest rates, affecting EMIs and loan costs. Hence, no rate cut had dampened sentiment in the sector, pushing the stocks down significantly earlier this month. However, several analysts now expect RBI to deliver a repo rate cut during its upcoming meeting scheduled for October. ""While concerns of potential rising inflation in the U.S. is weighing on the market there, the bold reform initiatives in India and the sustained money flows into the market are imparting resilience to the market. With retail inflation in India remaining much lower than expected (1.55% in July) another rate cut by the MPC is possible soon even though the RBI is cautious in the context of heightened global uncertainty,"" said VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments. The expectations of a rate cut may have further fuelled the optimism in the real estate sector. GST reforms: While delivering his Independence Day speech, Prime Minister Narendra Modi hinted at the next generation of Goods and Services Tax (GST) reforms to be announced as a Diwali gift for consumers. The Centre has proposed to move towards ""simple tax"" with 2 slabs—""standard and merit"", with special rates applicable for only for select few items. This will likely reduce tax burden on consumers, thereby increasing discretionary spending limit, which in turn may boost housing demand. Value buying: The sharp rise in the share prices also comes after a strong correction. After hitting a record high in June, the Nifty Realty index tumbled nearly 17 percent in just two months to hit a low of nearly 871 in August. The sharp correction may have made the stocks attractive for investors at the current levels. The index has now risen nearly 6 percent in eight sessions. Anant Raj shares were the top gainer on the index, rising more than 3 percent to trade at Rs 555 apiece.

"Prince Pipes rallies 6 percent on improved outlook, Motilal Oswal says sector on the cusp of recovery",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/prince-pipes-rallies-6-percent-on-improved-outlook-motilal-oswal-says-sector-on-the-cusp-of-recovery-13474762.html,"Shares of Prince Pipes are sharply higher by 6 percent in trade after a Motilal Oswal note said on August 21 that the sector is poised for recovery following DGTR's recent recommendation for an anti-dumping duty and prices of PVC stabilizing at lower levels. MOSL in its note observed that the companies in the sector are looking ripe for a volume recovery in the July-August period, and are retaining their FY26 guidance as the demand outlook seems to be improving. ""Though 1QFY26 was weighed down by weak macros, muted demand, and inventory losses from PVC volatility, we expect the PVC pipes industry to see a gradual recovery from 2QFY26 (on a low base), with a further pickup in momentum from 2HFY26,"" said the MOSL note. This recovery is likely to be supported by improving PVC prices, which will lead to restocking, supported by Centre's infrastructure push and improving housing demand. Prince Pipes had posted a muted quarter as volatile pricing and the early monsoon had dampened demand. The management has anticipated a gradual demand recovery for the rest of FY26, with a high single-to-low double-digit volume growth for the year. The bathware segment is expected to generate Rs 50-60 crore in revenue and could break-even by mid-FY27, according to the company, with plans of expasion in the southern and eastern markets in this segment. The company is expanding its eighth manufacturing facility which is expected to be completed by Q2FY26. ""We expect Prince Pipes to clock 14%/37%/71% CAGR in revenue/EBITDA/PAT over FY25-28. We value the stock at 30x FY27 EPS to arrive at our target of Rs 440,"" said MOSL. Read More The PVC pipe industry is coming out of a year that saw inflationary pressures and subdued demand across segments, with a reduction in government's infrastructure spending, leading to caution in inventory optimization by channel partners. An increased volatility in PVC resin prices too dampened volume growth and profitability across the industry. Going forward, the management is confident of 'high single-digit to low double-digit' growth for the rest of the year. Prince Pipes also said it is focusing on geographical expansion and innovation to navigate the market uncertainties. ""Looking ahead, we are optimistic about a gradual recovery in demand, supported by the government's renewed thrust on infrastructure spending,"" Parag Chheda, Joint MD of Price Pipes said during the June quarter earnings call. The stock is down 19 percent on a YTD basis but has rebounded by close to 18 percent in the last five trading sessions. Prince Pipes has a near 5 percent share in PVC pipes segment and is among the top six players in the industry that is increasingly getting organised.

Kotak noted that recent data indicates the impact of IndiGo’s capacity cuts, which seem to be occurring at a slightly faster pace than its key competitor. However, the brokerage clarified, “We would not take this as a sign of weakening demand.” According to Kotak, the airline is phasing out damp leases and possibly deferring new aircraft deliveries during what is traditionally a loss-making quarter. Unlike its earlier approach of adding capacity in Q2 ahead of strong Q3 and Q4 demand, IndiGo is now focusing on measures to support yield growth during the festive season. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog Kotak further highlighted that airlines aim to avoid setting low yields as the new norm, particularly when most carriers are operating at a loss. Despite falling crude prices, yields have remained flat for the past three years, which Kotak described as a “commendable feat.” The brokerage expects carriers to push for year-on-year yield growth in the upcoming festive season. As part of its capacity adjustments, IndiGo has reduced its average monthly flight count to around 2,000 for the current months, representing a decline of 11 percent compared to Q4FY25 and 9 percent compared to Q1FY26. By comparison, Air India has reduced its flights by 10 percent and 8 percent, respectively. For the June quarter, IndiGo reported a net profit of Rs 2,176 crore, down 20.2 percent from Rs 2,728 crore in the corresponding period last year. Revenue rose 4.7 percent year-on-year to Rs 20,496 crore, but missed the estimated Rs 21,150 crore.

The sellers of the promoter group, namely Ashok Ramnarayan Boob and family and Krishnakumar Ramnarayan Boob and family are looking to dilute up to 24 percent stake as part of the proposed trade. The sale is likely to raise Rs 2,626 crore or $302 million dollars, with the floor price at Rs 1,030 apiece. This is a 13 percent discount to the previous session's closing price. India Cements Ltd., now a subsidiary of India's largest cement company, UltraTech Cement Ltd, rose over 3 percent ahead of the Offer For Sale (OFS) from its parent company.

Technical View Nifty continues to exhibit resilience, led by strength in IT counters, while sustaining above the 25,000 mark has confirmed follow-through bullish momentum. Notably, major call writers have begun shifting their positions to higher strikes, adding further conviction to the bullish structure. A sustained push beyond 25,100 is likely to reignite strong upward momentum towards 25,250, forcing significant call writers into short-covering, thereby accelerating gains. On the flip side, support zones have shifted higher, with dips toward 24,800 expected to attract accumulation. Firm positioning by Put writers near at-the-money strikes lends additional support to this constructive view. Unless the index decisively breaches 24,770, the bulls are expected to retain the upper hand. For now, a “buy-on-dips” strategy remains the most prudent play, with traders eyeing a breakout above 25,200 to confirm the next leg of upside momentum. SBI Life Insurance, Bajaj Finserv, Reliance Industries, Shriram Finance, and Trent were the top gainers on the Nifty.

On the downside, dips toward 55,500 continue to be seen as attractive accumulation zones, supported by firm put writing activity at near-the-money strikes,"" Dhupesh Dhameja of SAMCO Securities said. ""A breach below 55,450, however, would signal early weakness and could push the index lower toward the 55,000 mark. Until then, sideways action is likely to prevail.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Infosys, Tata Consumer Products, Cummins India, Mphasis, Swiggy, FACT, Bikaji Foods, and others on August 21?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-infosys-tata-consumer-products-cummins-india-mphasis-swiggy-fact-bikaji-foods-and-others-on-august-21-13473563.html,"The benchmark indices advanced 0.3 percent on August 20, continuing their uptrend for the fifth straight session with positive market breadth. A total of 1,553 shares saw buying interest, compared to 1,164 shares that were under pressure on the NSE. The market may retain its gradual upward trajectory, given healthy technical indicators. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Nilesh Jain, Head – Technical and Derivatives Research Analyst (Equity Research) at Centrum Broking Tata Consumer Products | CMP: Rs 1,105.3 Tata Consumer has given a breakout from a falling wedge pattern on the daily chart, indicating a bullish reversal. It has also crossed above all key short-term and long-term moving averages, further strengthening the positive outlook. We anticipate the stock to surpass the immediate resistance at Rs 1,110 and move towards the Rs 1,170 level in the near term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,170 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,068 Jindal Steel and Power | CMP: Rs 1,016.3 Jindal Steel continues to find support along its rising trendline and recently achieved a multi-month breakout above the Rs 1,008 level. It is trading firmly above all key short-term and long-term moving averages, reflecting strong underlying strength. Moreover, momentum indicators and oscillators on the daily chart have confirmed a bullish crossover, reinforcing the positive bias. Given this setup, we expect the stock to move towards a new all-time high near Rs 1,100 in the near term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,100 Stop-Loss: Rs 975 Cummins India | CMP: Rs 3,318.4 Cummins India is forming a saucer bottom pattern on the chart, signaling a gradual accumulation phase and potential trend reversal. On the derivatives front, a strong buildup of long positions indicates positive market sentiment. Furthermore, momentum indicators and oscillators remain in buy mode on both the daily and weekly charts. Considering this technical setup, the stock is poised for continued upside in the short term, and adopting a buy-on-dips approach is advisable. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 4,100 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,650 Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical Research and Derivatives at SBI Securities Mphasis | CMP: Rs 2,835.5 On Wednesday, the Nifty IT index emerged as a clear outperformer among frontline indices, registering a robust gain of over 2.7%. This marks a significant technical development, as the index has decisively crossed above its 20-day EMA for the first time since July 9, indicating a potential shift in short-term momentum. Among individual stocks, Mphasis stood out with a breakout from a symmetrical triangle pattern on the daily chart. This breakout is backed by a noticeable increase in trading volumes, lending credibility to the move and suggesting strong market participation. Technically, the stock is now trading above both its short-term and long-term moving averages. Momentum indicators are also supporting the bullish narrative. The daily RSI is on the verge of crossing the 60 mark, and its upward trajectory reflects improving strength in price action. This confluence of price breakout, volume confirmation, and supportive trend and momentum indicators suggests that Mphasis may be poised for further upside in the near term. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the Rs 2,840-2,820 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,050 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,740 Swiggy | CMP: Rs 421 Swiggy marked a swing high of Rs 429.90 on July 24, and thereafter witnessed a minor correction. During this phase, volume activity remained mostly below average—indicating a lack of aggressive selling pressure and suggesting the correction was a healthy consolidation. The correction halted near the 100-day EMA, after which the stock has resumed its upward movement. Currently, Swiggy is on the verge of a Stage-2 Cup pattern breakout on the daily chart—a bullish continuation pattern that typically signals the start of a fresh uptrend. Notably, Wednesday’s trading session saw volumes rise above the 50-day average, a sign of accumulation and growing investor interest ahead of the breakout. Technically, the stock is trading above all its key moving averages, which are aligned in a bullish sequence, further reinforcing trend strength. Momentum indicators are supportive—the daily RSI is in bullish territory and continues to rise, indicating improving price strength. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the Rs 425-420 range. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 460 Stop-Loss: Rs 408 FACT | CMP: Rs 1,014.5 Fertilizers and Chemicals Travancore has shown encouraging price action by establishing a strong base near its 100-day EMA, which acted as a key support during the recent consolidation. Following this base formation, the stock witnessed a sharp rebound, supported by higher-than-average volumes—indicating renewed buying interest and improving sentiment. Currently, the stock is trading over 10% above its 100-day EMA and more than 12% above its 200-day EMA, underscoring the strength of the ongoing uptrend. This significant distance from key moving averages reflects strong bullish momentum, suggesting the stock is comfortably within a well-defined upward trajectory. Adding to the positive setup, the daily RSI has surged past the 60 mark for the first time since June 2025, signaling a shift in momentum and validating the current rally. Hence, we recommend accumulating in the Rs 1,020-1,010 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,100 Stop-Loss: Rs 980 Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities Infosys | CMP: Rs 1,496 For the first time in several sessions, Infosys managed to reclaim the 21-EMA on the daily chart. Following the recent correction, the stock has shown a healthy uptick, accompanied by decent volumes. The RSI has formed a hidden positive divergence on the daily timeframe. Based on this technical setup, the uptrend is expected to continue in the short term.

It has also given a swing high breakout on the daily chart, indicating the possibility of a strong price move. The RSI is in a bullish crossover and is trending higher.

"Sebi close to finalising block deal norms, with higer price range and deal size",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sebi-close-to-finalising-revamped-block-deal-norms-with-higer-price-range-and-deal-size-13473305.html,"Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is likely to finalise the framework for block deals soon, including tweaking the reference price range and increasing the minimum order size. Sebi had formed a working group which shared its recommendations recently. With inputs from market participants, Sebi is expected to finalise the framework soon. The block deal mechanism allows pre-negotiated deals between parties to be executed on the exchange within designated windows and under strict rules to prevent price manipulation. Moneycontrol had previously reported on May 27 that block deals could get a makeover, and on August 11 that the Sebi working group had proposed a broader price range and higher order size. The Higher Price Range for Block Deals As per sources, Sebi may come up with two kinds of price ranges for block deals. Stocks which are available for trading in the Futures & Options (F&O) segment may remain within the plus and minus 1 percent price range of the applicable reference price. Non-F&O segment stocks may be placed under the plus and minus 3 percent price range of the reference price. A working group formed on the issue had suggested a price range of 5 percent for the morning block deal window and a 3 percent price range for the afternoon trading window, though one of the exchanges had suggested a plus and minus 2 percent price range. NSE data for FY25 suggested that around 66 percent of block deals happened in non-F&O stocks. Higher Order Threshold Similarly, the minimum order size is likely to be revised to Rs 25 crore instead of the current Rs 10 crore. The working group had recommended that the limit should be hiked, and the rationale was that benchmark indices have increased nearly three times over the last 10 years. So, with the growth in the size and depth of markets, it is desirable that limits be increased. Higher Order Size based on Data Study Sebi also analysed the data of block deals of FY25 at NSE and concluded that 90 percent of block deals were of the size above Rs 14 crore, 75 percent above Rs 26 crore, 60 percent above Rs 50 crore, and 50 percent above Rs 84 crore. So, the need was felt to review the order size. Sebi had last tweaked the order size in October 2017. One market participant, on the condition of anonymity, said, “The higher threshold is expected to bring liquidity, as the orders below Rs 25 crore will take place in the normal market.” The Sebi working group was of the view that raising the order size limit would ensure participation mainly from serious institutional investors, not high-net-worth individuals or family offices, who bypass the main market via block deals. Also read: Sebi panel on Takeover Regulations reviews definition of control, no tweaks to open offer and creeping acquisition threshold Common Reference Price Duration for Block Deal Windows Sebi may also approve the common reference price duration of 30 minutes for block deal windows. The Sebi working group was of the view that it should be common across windows. Currently, the morning window’s reference price duration (8:45–9:00 am) is based on the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) of the last 30 minutes of trades from the previous day’s close. But the afternoon window’s reference price duration (2:05–2:20 pm) uses the VWAP of trades executed in the stock between 1:45 pm and 2:00 pm. OFS-like Mechanism as an Alternative to Block Deals It is also being discussed with stakeholders such as exchanges, clearing corporations, mutual funds, and brokers that a simplified version of the Offer for Sale (OFS)-like mechanism can be introduced for non-promoter shareholders. It will act as an alternative to the block deal mechanism. Though, it may take longer time to materialize. The mechanism of block deals was introduced by Sebi in 2005 and is primarily used by institutional investors such as mutual funds and insurance companies to execute large trades without disturbing the market price. An email seeking comments from Sebi on the proposed changes, did not elicit any response.

Reduce TCI Express: target of Rs 700: Emkay Global Financial,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/reduce-tci-express-target-of-rs-700-emkay-global-financial-13471979.html,"Emkay Global Financial's research report on TCI Express TCI Express (TCIE)’s Q1FY26 results were in line with our muted expectations. The company’s efforts to diversify business beyond surface express seem to be fructifying, as international air express/C2C segments registered 33%/14% YoY growth, respectively. While margins in new services (especially air express) are lower than those for surface, we view the management strategy of growing its multimodal services toward contributing 20-22% of overall revenue in coming 2-3 years positively, given the diversification benefits. Owing to elevated competitive intensity in surface and a challenging external environment, we maintain our low expectations – only 5% volume growth trajectory over FY25-28. We believe TCIE’s investment in automation, while being beneficial in the long term, would keep return ratios and margins under pressure, especially given the current tepid environment. Outlook We cut FY27E/28E EBITDA by 6%/5%, respectively, factoring in the lower margins from new services, while retaining REDUCE. Jun-26E TP of Rs700 remains unchanged (basis DCF methodology), implying FY27E EV/EBITDA of 16x and P/E of 25x.

Advent-backed CDMO firm Cohance scouts for western API assets to meet demand and hedge against tariffs,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/advent-backed-cdmo-firm-cohance-scouts-for-western-api-assets-to-meet-demand-and-hedge-against-tariffs-13471537.html,"Cohance Lifesciences, the private equity firm Advent International-backed contract development and manufacturing organisation (CDMO) is actively scouting for API manufacturing assets in the US and Europe, looking at a dual-shore model to offset geopolitical shocks and to cultivate proximity in manufacturing. “If I find a US or Europe-based site in API, I would love to do that,” said Vivek Sharma, Executive Chairman, Hyderabad-based Cohance LIfesciences told Moneycontrol in a recent interview. “That allows me to offer an East-West combination. It allows us to offer more.” The move comes amid lingering uncertainty over US-China trade relations and the potential imposition of tariffs on pharmaceuticals by President Trump. Even though pharma has largely been exempted so far, Cohance is taking no chances. “Even before Trump came, people wanted to do it in the West. But now that strategy has become more relevant,” Sharma said. Cohance already supplies API intermediates from India but sees strategic value in owning Western manufacturing capabilities. “People sometimes want to have an API being manufactured in the US and Europe for different reasons - close proximity to formulation sites, regulatory speed, or simply convenience,” he said. The company’s acquisition strategy is modelled on Sharma's previous experience at Piramal Pharma, where he led the acquisitions of pharmaceutical manufacturing sites in Lexington, Kentucky and Michigan. “It offers customers flexibility. If they want Western manufacturing, this is the price. If they want Eastern, I can give you this,” he explained. Beyond proximity, Sharma emphasized integration benefits. “If I get an API business in North America, I can do backward integration. I can create a lot more value with the same business.” Cohance’s broader growth strategy includes expanding its capabilities in antibody drug conjugates (ADC) and oligonucleotides. The recent acquisitions like NJBio and Sapala have bolstered its capabilities in ADC and oligonucleotides. While ADC is closer to commercial maturity, oligo remains in the preclinical phase, with new facilities in Hyderabad expected to accelerate progress. The company has secured commercial supply contracts with two large global innovators and added 14 new customers to its ADC platform in CY25. It is constructing a $10 million cGMP bioconjugation suite at NJ Bio’s Princeton facility and a dedicated OEB6 high-containment block in Hyderabad for a customized payload program. In oligonucleotides, the company is investing ₹230 million in a cGMP facility in Hyderabad, targeting 700 kg/year GMP capacity by the end of CY25. “We are the only ADC commercial supplier of payloads from India, we work with two of the large innovators in the world. We are talking to the third one,” he said. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) consist of monoclonal antibodies that target tumor cells and cytotoxic drugs linked through linkers. By leveraging antibodies' targetting properties, ADCs deliver cytotoxic drugs into tumor cells destroying them. Cohance reported consolidated revenue of Rs 549 crore for the first quarter of FY26, marking a 13% on-year growth. The revenue was broadly distributed across three segments - API+ contributed 54%, Pharma CDMO accounted for 37% and Specialty Chemicals made up the remaining 9%. Adjusted for inventory destocking, the Pharma CDMO segment grew by over 30% on-year, while API+ grew by 19% and Specialty Chemicals by 28%. Cohance generated Rs 232 crore in free cash flow during Q1FY26 and holds Rs 441 crore in cash and equivalents. As geopolitical tensions and trade barriers reshape global supply chains, Cohance's Vivek Sharma said India given its talent and capabilities will continue to be relevant. “India has moved from being a cost center to a capability center,” said Sharma, highlighting a growing acceptability in global pharma circles. “Ten years ago, you had to sell India before you sold your company. Today, India sells itself.” The Trump-era tariffs, which once cast a shadow over China’s pharmaceutical exports, have inadvertently boosted India’s appeal. While pharma has largely been exempted from punitive tariffs, the broader sentiment has nudged global innovators to diversify away from China. “Even if tariffs apply, our contracts are structured such that the impact is minimal. The customer bears it, not us,” Cohance's Vivek Sharma said. The company has set an ambitious $1 billion revenue target by 2030, a goal it remains committed to despite macroeconomic headwinds. “It’s like setting a GPS. You may take different routes, but the destination remains the same,” said Vivek Sharma.",The company has secured commercial supply contracts with two large global innovators and added 14 new customers to its ADC platform in CY25.,The company has secured commercial supply contracts with two large global innovators and added 14 new customers to its ADC platform in CY25.,I can create a lot more value with the same business.” Cohance’s broader growth strategy includes expanding its capabilities in antibody drug conjugates (ADC) and oligonucleotides.,"Cohance Lifesciences, the private equity firm Advent International-backed contract development and manufacturing organisation (CDMO) is actively scouting for API manufacturing assets in the US and Europe, looking at a dual-shore model to offset geopolitical shocks and to cultivate proximity in manufacturing."

The shares of the company hit an intraday high of Rs 1,951 apiece. Airtel's website shows the price of the plan has changed to Rs 299. The Rs 249 prepaid plan earlier offered 1 GB of daily data, unlimited local, STD and roaming calls, along with 100 SMS per day. It carried a validity of 24 days, and was considered one of the most budget-friendly pack offered by the telecom major. According to the details on the website, the Rs 299 prepaid pack will offer 1 GB data and 100 SMS per day for 28 days. ""Effective 00:00 Hours, Aug 20, 2025, recharge 249 will be discontinued,"" read a notice on Airtel Thanks app. Notably, Airtel's Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) stood at Rs 250 for Q1 FY26. Reliance Jio has also discontinued its entry-level 1 GB per day prepaid packs priced at Rs 209 for 22 days and Rs 249 for 28 days. Jefferies said Jio and Bharti’s tariff tweaks will likely boost data usage among the users. The rise in the base plan price can lift ARPU by 4 to 8 percent in a revenue neutral way. ""We view the move as positive for subscriber monetisation,"" it added. The international brokerage kept a target price of Rs 2,500 per share for the shares of Airtel, implying an upside potential of nearly 31 percent from the stock’s previous closing price.

"GST tax hike could choke ITC, tobacco peers",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/gst-tax-hike-could-choke-itc-tobacco-peers-13470926.html,"Cigarette makers could face another round of volume pressure if the government raises GST on “sin goods” to 40 percent without adjusting existing cess, analysts warned. At present, tobacco products are taxed at a base 28 percent GST, but with the addition of compensation cess, specific levies, basic excise duty and NCCD, the total tax incidence already balloons to as much as 55 percent of retail prices. A 40 percent slab, if applied on top of current cess rates, could lift the effective tax burden on ITC by 9–10 percent, according to ICICI Securities estimates. Analysts say such a rise could test even the resilience of the sector leader, and would inevitably weigh harder on smaller rivals. Ajay Thakur, FMCG analyst at Anand Rathi, cautioned that cigarette volumes typically hold up under low-to-mid single-digit hikes, but “a double-digit increase in incidence could lead to a 4–5 percent hit to consumption.” When tax hikes hurt before The risk isn’t new. When GST was first rolled out in 2017 with a 28 percent rate on tobacco products, ITC’s cigarette volumes dipped into negative territory for three straight quarters before gradually recovering. A similar blow was seen during the Covid-19 lockdowns, when consumption collapsed on health concerns and restricted mobility, before demand eventually normalised. ITC today looks healthier, with 6 percent volume growth in Q1 FY26, but analysts cautioned that history shows how quickly demand can wobble when taxes rise sharply. Complex structure clouds outlook Currently, cigarettes are taxed via multiple layers: 28 percent GST plus a variable cess of 5–36 percent, making up 15–26 percent of MRP. On top of this, a specific levy of Rs 2.1–Rs 4.2 per stick adds another 25–30 percent, while basic excise duty and NCCD contribute 5–7 percent. Reports suggested the Centre could move to a flat 40 percent GST slab, merging cess with excise. On paper, that could bring effective incidence closer to 26 percent of MRP versus today’s 48–55 percent. But most analysts expect a neutral-to-slightly higher outcome, not relief, given cigarettes’ “sin” classification. Winners and losers Among listed peers, VST Industries looks the most vulnerable, given already fragile sales in the June quarter, weak pricing power and slow portfolio premiumisation. ITC and Godfrey Phillips appear better cushioned, thanks to steadier volumes and broader product mixes. So far this year, performance has diverged sharply. Godfrey has more than doubled as volumes surged 25 percent in Q1, aided by strength in premium cigarettes, capsule formats, chewing products and exports. ITC shares have slipped 2 percent on muted cigarette growth, stake sales by top shareholder British American Tobacco, and softer FMCG trends. VST has dropped 18 percent, leaving it as the least favoured play. Until the government clarifies how the GST 2.0 structure will be applied, analysts expect tobacco stocks to stay volatile. “If the incidence only rises modestly, ITC and Godfrey can absorb it. But if it’s a double-digit jump, volumes will suffer,” Thakur said. That could mean a long spell of slow growth and stock performances, analysts warn.

Shares of Vedanta fell sharply after the NCLT's decision to defer the demerger case hearing to September 17, triggering worries of further delay to the process, as two key hurdles have appeared to the business restructuring. CNBC-TV18 reported that the Centre has said that the government will not be able to recover dues if the demerger is followed through, and that there has 'concealment' and non-disclosure of key details. The mining major had 'inflated revenue' and 'concealed liabilities', the Centre informed the NCLT. Vedanta had on August 14 confirmed that it received an administrative warning from Sebi over modification to the Scheme of Arrangement without prior written consent of Sebi. The company has been advised by the regulator to exercise caution in future, and share the board’s comments on the administrative warning, along with corrective actions that will be undertaken. The regulator told NCLT that modifying the scheme of arrangement after regulator and exchange's nod is a 'serious breach', and Vedanta shall have to place the warning before the board. Vedanta's board is scheduled to meet on August 21 to consider a second interim dividend for FY26. Vedanta had approached the NCLT to seek approval to the demerger process, which the company has cited as a top priority. In an earlier NCLT hearing, the Centre had expressed concern over payment of disputed dues payable by Cairn in an ongoing arbitration ruling, and Vedanta had said that it is working with all stakeholders to arrive at a solution.","The Centre has raised 'serious objections' to Vedanta's demerger and has cited 'concealment and non-disclosure' of details, with the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) pushing back the hearing on the matter just days after Sebi issued an administrative warning to the Anil Agarwal-led company over modifying the Scheme of Arrangement without consent from the regulator.","The Centre has raised 'serious objections' to Vedanta's demerger and has cited 'concealment and non-disclosure' of details, with the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) pushing back the hearing on the matter just days after Sebi issued an administrative warning to the Anil Agarwal-led company over modifying the Scheme of Arrangement without consent from the regulator.","In an earlier NCLT hearing, the Centre had expressed concern over payment of disputed dues payable by Cairn in an ongoing arbitration ruling, and Vedanta had said that it is working with all stakeholders to arrive at a solution.","The Centre has raised 'serious objections' to Vedanta's demerger and has cited 'concealment and non-disclosure' of details, with the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) pushing back the hearing on the matter just days after Sebi issued an administrative warning to the Anil Agarwal-led company over modifying the Scheme of Arrangement without consent from the regulator."

"Infosys, Mphasis, other IT shares rise up to 4% ahead of Fed's Jackson Hole conference: Here's why",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/infosys-mphasis-other-it-shares-rise-up-to-3-ahead-of-fed-s-jackson-hole-conference-here-s-why-13470765.html,"The shares of IT companies recorded notable rise on August 20, leading gains among the sectors on market today. The Nifty IT index rose nearly 3 percent, extending gains for the second consecutive session. The sharp rise in the IT stocks comes ahead of US Federal Reserve's Jackson Hole conference. The American central bank is set to hold its annual symposium from August 21 to August 23 in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak on the economic outlook and central bank's policy framework on Friday. US President Donald Trump has criticised Powell multiple times for not cutting rates. In a Truth Social post, Trump referred to Powell as “Jerome ‘Too Late’ Powell"" and accused him of not acting promptly to reduce interest rates. He also stated that Powell is ""hurting"" the housing industry ""very badly"" and reiterated his call for a cut in key interest rates. Most investors now expect a 25-basis-point Fed rate cut next month. A rate cut in the US could support economic growth and aid a revival in client spending, boosting the IT sector. Indian IT companies derive a major portion of their revenue from US market. Infosys shares were the top gainer on the Nifty IT index, rising nearly 4 percent to trade at Rs 1,497.5 apiece. Kotak Institutional Equities maintained a 'Buy' rating on the stock, with a target price of Rs 1,850 per share. This implies an upside potential of nearly 28.5 percent from the stock's previous closing price. It highlighted Infosys CEO Salil Parekh's key comments on AI readiness, early focus on Project Maximus and acquisitions Mphasis and Coforge shares followed, rising over 3 percent each. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) shares gained nearly 3 percent, while Tech Mahindra and Persistent Systems shares were up around 2 percent each. LTI Mindtree, Wipro and HCL Tech shares gained more than 1 percent each. Valuations have corrected and now appear reasonable, said JM Financial. ""While demand may not bounce back rapidly, clarity on tariff rates – now emerging – and fed rate cut – now three likely in 2025 – could trigger a mean-reversion of sorts for multiples,"" it said. ""Rising probability of Fed rate cut (likely limited effect of tariff on inflation) implies that market expects companies to absorb most of tariff increase. That could further squeeze IT Services spend, in our view. These pressures, in turn, are driving higher vendor consolidation opportunities – a positive – and margin pressures – a negative. That said, benign valuations and subdued expectations mean these concerns are likely priced in. Fed rate cut could therefore trigger a minor bounce back, in our view. Stocks with valuation buffers are better placed,"" the domestic brokerage added. JM Financial says it prefers Infosys and TCS among the large-caps, Coforge and Mphasis among the mid-caps, and Sagility among the small-caps at the current levels.

Centum Electronics Credit Ratings Upgraded to CARE BBB; Positive Outlook,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/centum-electronics-credit-ratings-upgraded-to-care-bbb-positive-outlook-alpha-article-13470839.html,"Centum Electronics (CENTUM.NS) Credit Rating Upgraded to CARE BBB; Outlook Positive. Care Ratings Limited has upgraded Centum Electronics Limited’s credit rating to CARE BBB with a Positive outlook, citing expectations of improved operating profitability driven by a growing order book, particularly within its Strategic Electronic Business Unit (SEBU). The ratings agency revised the outlook from Stable to Positive due to the anticipated boost in operating profitability, stemming from a growing order book, specifically in the high-margin SEBU, which focuses on the Indian space and defense sectors. Liquidity is supported by funds raised via a qualified institutional placement (QIP). Promoter Experience, Client Relationships Underpin Rating: The rating reflects the promoters' extensive industry experience and Centum's established relationships with a strong client base generating repeat orders. It also mirrors an above-average financial risk profile, characterized by increasing income, satisfactory debt coverage, and significantly improved capital structure at the consolidated level. These strengths are partially offset by working capital-intensive operations and losses from its French subsidiary, Centum T&S (CTS). The upgrade also considers the material improvement in capital structure following the QIP issue in Q4 FY25. CareEdge Ratings anticipates the capital raise will enable Centum to scale operations profitably and undertake planned capital expenditures without incremental debt. The increasing proportion of higher-margin SEBU orders is expected to translate into improved profit before depreciation, interest, and taxes (PBDIT) margins. Rating Sensitivities: Upside Factors: Sustained increase in the scale of operations while maintaining a profit before interest, lease rentals, depreciation and taxation (PBILDT) margin above 9.5% could lead to further upgrades. Downside Factors: A downgrade could occur if the interest coverage ratio (ICR) falls below 3x or total outside liabilities to tangible net worth (TOL/TNW) exceeds 3.5x. Analytical Approach: Consolidated financial and operational performance of Centum Electronics and its foreign subsidiaries has been considered, reflecting strong financial and management linkages. Outlook: Positive. CareEdge Ratings expects the increasing order book, especially in the SEBU division, and management decisions regarding subsidiaries will reduce the loss impact on Centum Electronics, improving its operating profitability on a consolidated basis. The outlook may revert to 'Stable' if operating profitability margin improvements are lower than anticipated. Key Strengths Detailed: Centum Electronics boasts a growing order book, with orders at ₹1,736 crore as of March 31, 2025, compared to ₹1,642 crore as of March 31, 2024, driven by its proven technical capabilities. The company benefits from experienced promoters, including Apparao V Mallavarapu Rao, with over three decades of electronics industry experience. Centum Electronics has been designing and manufacturing high-end electronics modules since 1994. Centum has strong relationships with a reputed clientele, delivering mission-critical electronics for ISRO and other key players. The company successfully raised ₹210 crore through a QIP in March 2025, materially improving its capital structure. The TOL/TNW improved to 2.57x as of March 31, 2025, from 6.99x as of March 31, 2024. These funds will repay debts, fund capital expenditure, and for general corporate purposes. Centum demonstrates an above-average financial profile, marked by satisfactory coverage indicators. PBILDT margins have improved from 8.06% in FY24 to 8.43% in FY25. Further improvements are expected in the near-to-medium term. Key Weaknesses: Centum's operations are working capital intensive, with a long gestation period from order to execution. Growing order book has led to near-full working capital utilization. The company's subsidiary, CTS, has been loss-making. CEL infused ₹33 crore into CTS in FY24 and a further ₹45 crore in FY25. Management expects no further support will be required. Liquidity: Adequate. Centum's liquidity is adequate, with expected improvements in cash accruals. The recent QIP is expected to maintain working capital utilization at manageable levels. Average WC utilization stands at 72% for the 12 months ending June 2025. ESG Focus: The company remains committed to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles, focusing on reducing environmental footprint, fostering diversity, and ensuring employee well-being.

"Aurobindo Pharma clarifies, reports of Zentiva buyout 'premature', no binding agreement yet",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/aurobindo-pharma-clarifies-reports-of-zentiva-buyout-premature-no-binding-agreement-yet-13470758.html,"Aurobindo Pharma, a leading player in the active pharmaceutical ingredient and generic market, has issued a statement clarifying that reports of buying out Prague-based generic drugmaker Zentiva are 'premature', and no binding agreement has been made by company, according to a company filing issued on August 20. Earlier today, The Economic Times had reported citing people familiar with the development that the pharma company is the frontrunner to acquire Zentiva from Advent International for $5-5.5 billion, or Rs 43,500-47,900 crore. The shares of Aurobindo Pharma recovered from early lows soon after the statement was made public, though still lower by 3 percent in the trading session. So far in 2025, Aurobindo Pharma’s stock has declined by 21 percent, compared with a 2 percent modest rise in the benchmark Nifty 50 index. ""...at present, no binding agreement or definitive decision has been made by the Board of Directors of the Company in relation to the transaction referred to in the said article(s). Accordingly, the said news item is premature and should not be relied upon,"" the company filing said. Aurobindo Pharma added that it 'regularly explores' various strategic opportunities, including potential acquisitions and partnerships, which can enhance shareholder value. ""In the event of any definitive development requiring disclosure under the SEBI Listing Regulations, the Company will promptly make the necessary and timely announcements to the stock exchanges in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements,"" Aurobindo Pharma added. At the said deal valuations, this would have emerged as the biggest acquisition by an Indian pharma player anywhere in the world, larger than Sun Pharma’s acquisition of Daiichi Sankyo’s stake in Ranbaxy or Biocon Biologics’ buyout of US-based Viatris. Aurobindo Pharma's wholly-owned US subsidiary had in July agreed to acquire Lannett Company LLC, a complex generics player, for approximately Rs 2,185 crore, in order to boost its manufacturing presence in the US. These efforts align with the management's goal of diversifying the product portfolio to serve the US generics space more effectively. A lot of the pharma companies see acquisitions as a way to boost manufacturing in the US, in order to avoid US President Trump's proposed tariffs on drugmakers, in order to get them to reduce prices and shift manufacturing on American soil. Aurobindo Pharma relies on the US for nearly 50% of its annual sales. “We’ll be putting initially a small tariff on pharmaceuticals, but in one year - one and a half years, maximum - it’s going to go to 150% and then it’s going to go to 250% because we want pharmaceuticals made in our country,” Trump had recently said during an interview to CNBC International.","Aurobindo Pharma's wholly-owned US subsidiary had in July agreed to acquire Lannett Company LLC, a complex generics player, for approximately Rs 2,185 crore, in order to boost its manufacturing presence in the US.","Aurobindo Pharma, a leading player in the active pharmaceutical ingredient and generic market, has issued a statement clarifying that reports of buying out Prague-based generic drugmaker Zentiva are 'premature', and no binding agreement has been made by company, according to a company filing issued on August 20.","Aurobindo Pharma added that it 'regularly explores' various strategic opportunities, including potential acquisitions and partnerships, which can enhance shareholder value.","""In the event of any definitive development requiring disclosure under the SEBI Listing Regulations, the Company will promptly make the necessary and timely announcements to the stock exchanges in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements,"" Aurobindo Pharma added."

During the June quarter, PG Electro's net profit fell 21 percent on year to Rs 67 crore as against Rs 85 crore a year ago, as an early arrival of monsoon impacted seasonal sales, prompting it to lower its FY26 growth guidance. Following order cancellations this summer, the AC maker is now sitting on a substantial inventory of air conditioners and raw materials worth Rs 1,300 crore, which has cast a shadow on the full-year guidance. ""...we were confident heading into FY26, and our guidance reflected that optimism. But what changed quite quickly and unexpectedly was the weather. The monsoon arrived earlier than usual, and the room AC season ended abruptly. Sellout in the trade channel was lower than forecasted and inventory levels stayed higher for longer. In hindsight, we were not fully prepared for that kind of shift in this quarter,"" Vishal Gupta, MD (Finance), PG Electroplast had said after the June quarter earnings. The company had invested to set up a new air conditioner compressor plant along with a Chinese partner for internal requirement as well as to supply to other OEMs, which has been delayed to fiscal 2027, adding to the recent sour sentiment. However, Geojit Financial recently issued a Buy call though with a lower price target of Rs 623 per share, stating that all negatives are priced in. Geojit expects PGEL's inventory to be cleared in H2FY26 as seasonal demand picks up, with management looking to diversify to other business verticals like refrigerator, EV and compressor manufacturing. ""...we are planning a lot of diversifications and the results of those will be visible to you in the coming years,"" Pramod Gupta, CFO, PGEL said during the June quarter earnings call. As of FY24, PGEL generated over 60 percent of its revenue from air conditioners, washing machines and air coolers, and has now started to diversify into electronics, printed circuit board assemblies as well as plastic moulding. PGEL has already tied up to make EVs and lithium-ion batteries in partnership with Spiro Mobility (Africa).

The stock has now gained in four out of the last five trading sessions. In the past one week, shares of Ola Electric have surged by 20 percent, compared to a one percent rise in the benchmark Nifty 50 index. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog Earlier this week, the stock gained further attention after founder and chairman Bhavish Aggarwal laid out an ambitious growth strategy at the company’s annual Sankalp event. The company is aiming for a 25 to 30 percent share of India’s two-wheeler electric vehicle market, backed by vertical integration and new product launches. “Our target market share for two-wheeler EVs is about 25 to 30 percent with very high margins, so we believe we are on the trajectory again,” Aggarwal said. He added that Ola’s “mojo is still there” despite the challenges faced during its transition phase. Over the past 6 months, Ola Electric phased out its Gen 2 scooters, increased supplies of its Gen 3 models, and rolled out its first electric bike. “It’s been two quarters of transition. Along with product transition, we’ve had a distribution scale-up. You’ll now see, leading into the festive season, the market share volumes starting to inch upwards,” Aggarwal noted. He also stressed that profitability in electric vehicles requires more than just scale. “No one is making money. To make money with EVs, you need vertical integration, you need the technology development, you need the DNA of technology,” Aggarwal said. On the earnings side, Ola Electric reported a weak first quarter compared with the same period last year, though results were better when compared sequentially. Losses narrowed and revenue improved quarter-on-quarter. The company’s gross margin improved by 1,100 basis points sequentially and by 740 basis points compared to last year. Gross margins stood at 26 percent at the end of the June quarter, while the management expects the full-year gross margin to be in the range of 35 to 40 percent.

Aurobindo Pharma shares slide 4% on reports of Zentiva buyout talks,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/aurobindo-pharma-shares-slide-4-on-reports-of-zentiva-buyout-talks-13470262.html,"Aurobindo Pharma shares fell over 4 percent to Rs 1,039 apiece on August 20 after reports suggested that the company has emerged as the front-runner to acquire Prague-based generic drugmaker Zentiva for $5-5.5 billion (Rs 43,500-47,900 crore) from Advent International. If this deal goes through, it will be the largest-ever acquisition by an Indian pharmaceutical company, both domestically and internationally. It would surpass the $3.2 billion acquisition of Daiichi Sankyo’s stake in Ranbaxy in 2014, as well as Biocon Biologics’ $3.3 billion cash-and-stock deal to buy the global biosimilars business of US-based Viatris, the report said. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog According to the report, the deal is expected to strengthen Aurobindo’s footprint in Europe, particularly in Eastern European markets such as the Czech Republic, Romania, and Slovakia. These regions are seen as promising growth areas for biosimilars, especially as patents of major prescription drugs expire. So far in 2025, Aurobindo Pharma’s stock has declined by 21 percent, compared with a 2 percent modest rise in the benchmark Nifty 50 index. On the financial front, the company posted a consolidated net profit of Rs 824 crore in the June 2025 quarter (Q1 FY26), compared with Rs 918 crore in the same quarter of the previous year (Q1 FY25), reflecting a 10.2 percent year-on-year decline. Revenue from operations stood at Rs 7,868 crore in Q1 FY26, up four percent from Rs 7,567 crore in Q1 FY25. Operating EBITDA came in at Rs 1,603 crore in Q1 FY26 compared to Rs 1,619.6 crore in Q1 FY25. The EBITDA margin slipped to 20.4 percent year-on-year from 21.4 percent in the same quarter last year. Aurobindo Pharma’s US formulations revenue fell 1.9 percent year-on-year to Rs 3,488 crore ($408 million). The decline was attributed to destocking and seasonal headwinds. However, the company’s European formulations business remained strong, recording an 18 percent year-on-year growth to Rs 2,338 crore.

Bank and pharma stocks were the top drags while the broader market also edged lower. At about 9:40 am, the Sensex was down 52.07 points or 0.06 percent at 81,592.32, and the Nifty was down 25.80 points or 0.10 percent at 24,954.85.

President Trump’s tariff stance, seen as arbitrary and unpredictable, could persist, weighing on India in the near term and forcing the market to factor in its impact,"" V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments Ltd, said. Experts say FII selling is also a worry for markets. To be sure, Foreign investors (FIIs/FPIs) turned net sellers again on Tuesday, after a day of buying, offloading Indian equities worth Rs 634 crore. Domestic institutional investors (DIIs), meanwhile, sustained their support with net purchases of Rs 2,261 crore, according to provisional exchange data. At the opening bell, sectoral trends were mixed. Nifty Auto, IT and Consumer Durables were largely flat, while FMCG, Pharma, Metal, PSU Bank, Private Bank and Oil & Gas saw mild declines. Banking stocks were under pressure, dragging Nifty Bank down 0.4 percent. On the positive side, Energy, Infra and Realty indices inched higher, even as Media slipped nearly 1 percent. Volatility also edged up, with India VIX rising 0.9 percent. Among individual stocks, state-run defence equipment manufacturer Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. (HAL) rose 3 percent after CNBC TV-18 reported that the company is likely to receive a big purchase order. The Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) has cleared the purchase of 97 Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Mark1A fighter jets worth Rs 62,000 crore from HAL. An official confirmation would mean one of the largest purchase orders for the state-run enterprise, where the fighter jets would be indigenously developed. Shares of online gaming companies, including Delta Corp, Nazara Technologies and OnMobile Global, tumbled up to 6 percent after the Union Cabinet approved a Bill to regulate the sector. The proposed law prohibits online money gaming and related advertisements, prescribing fines and imprisonment for violators. Phoenix Mills shares jumped 4 percent after the company said the Competition Commission of India cleared its plan to buy out Canada Pension Plan Investment Board’s 49 percent stake in Island Star Mall Development for Rs 5,449.16 crore, giving PML full ownership and sole control of the subsidiary. Technical View Nifty continues to demonstrate strength while holding above its gap support near 24,800. A sustained breakout above 25,050 could unleash strong bullish momentum, as significant call writers risk being trapped, leading to potential short covering. On the downside, any dip towards the 24,750 zone is likely to be absorbed as an accumulation opportunity. Robust positioning by Put writers at near-the-money strikes further reinforces this constructive view. Only a decisive breach below 24,700 would warrant caution; until then, the bulls are expected to maintain control. For now, a “buy on dips” strategy remains the most prudent approach, with traders closely watching for a decisive breakout to resolve the current consolidation phase. Bharti Airtel, NTPC, Infosys, Eternal, and Hindustan Unilever were the top gainers on the Nifty. Shriram Finance, Bajaj Finance, Jio Financial Services, Hindalco, and Tata Motors were the major laggards.

According to government sources cited by CNBC TV-18, the Cabinet Committee on Security has cleared the acquisition of 97 Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Mark1A fighter jets for about Rs 62,000 crore. A formal announcement would mark a major milestone for HAL, which has been working on the indigenous Tejas programme to replace India’s ageing MiG-21 fleet. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates The LCA Mk1A, an upgraded variant of the Tejas, has been designed for enhanced combat capabilities. This will be the second big order for the aircraft after HAL secured a contract in February 2021. Deliveries are expected to kick off this year, with six jets scheduled for FY26, following the resolution of earlier engine supply challenges. UBS has maintained a ‘neutral’ stance on the stock with a target price of Rs 4,900, noting that execution of the new order will add to HAL’s already strong pipeline. Meanwhile, HAL posted a mixed performance in its June quarter results. Net profit declined 3.7 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,383.8 crore, even as revenue from operations climbed 10.8 percent to Rs 4,819 crore. A healthier product mix and execution of its Rs 1.89 lakh crore order book lifted operating performance — EBITDA rose nearly 30 percent to Rs 1,284 crore, with margins expanding to 26.7 percent from 22.8 percent a year earlier, defying expectations of a contraction. With a robust order pipeline, improving margins and a fresh round of aircraft orders in the offing, HAL remains firmly positioned at the centre of India’s defence manufacturing push. After Q1, Motilal Oswal said that the aircraft deliveries will likely pick up pace as engine supplies from GE ramp up, which should further support revenue visibility. At about 9:20 am, shares of the company were trading at Rs 4,560, higher by 2.5 percent from the last close on the NSE.
