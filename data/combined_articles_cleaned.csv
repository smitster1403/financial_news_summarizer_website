(NSDL) swung sharply on Tuesday, August 12 — rising up to 5 percent in early trade before paring almost all gains — as investors awaited the depository’s first quarterly results since its market debut, amid a broader decline in Indian equities. The stock had a volatile start to the week. On Monday, it briefly touched an intraday high of Rs 1,425, nearly 80 percent above its IPO price of Rs 800, before giving up gains and ending the session over 12 percent lower from the day’s peak. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Rival Central Depository Services (India) Ltd. (CDSL) recently reported a 15.3 percent sequential rise in revenue and an improvement in margins for the June quarter. However, the number of new demat accounts opened during the period dropped 11 percent both sequentially and year-on-year, even as demat custody value grew compared to the previous quarter. Since listing, NSDL shares have rallied sharply, pushing valuations above those of CDSL — a reversal from the discount they traded at prior to debut. The company entered the market on August 6 at Rs 880 on the BSE, a 10 percent premium to its issue price. The debut premium was lower than grey market expectations, though analysts have largely maintained a long-term bullish view on the stock, citing NSDL’s dominant position in the depository business.

So far in 2025, the stock has declined 12 percent, underperforming the benchmark Nifty 50’s 2 percent rise over the same period. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog For the quarter ended June 2025, SJVN’s consolidated net profit fell 36.2 percent year-on-year to Rs 227.8 crore. This decline came despite growth in revenue and an improvement in profit margins. Revenue from operations increased 5.4 percent to Rs 917.5 crore from Rs 870.4 crore in the same period last year, while operating profit (EBITDA) rose 11.2 percent to Rs 742.4 crore. Operating margin improved to 80.9 percent from 76.7 percent in Q1FY25, supported by higher efficiency in the generation business. The renewable energy segment, which includes wind and solar power, contributed Rs 115.62 crore to revenue in Q1FY26, more than doubling from Rs 55.83 crore a year earlier. Revenue from power trading, however, fell to Rs 0.78 crore from Rs 1.94 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. Other income during the quarter dropped to Rs 54.14 crore from Rs 88.10 crore in the year-ago period, with the bulk coming from bank interest and late payment surcharges from beneficiaries. On the policy side, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has directed public sector power companies — including SJVN, NTPC, NHPC, and Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) — to amend their renewable energy tenders to mandate the use of Indian-made solar cells. These PSUs also act as renewable energy implementing agencies (REIAs) as part of India’s plan to achieve 500 GW of non-fossil fuel power capacity by 2030. According to a senior MNRE official, the requirement will take effect 30 days after the ministry publishes “List II” of approved modules and manufacturers, specifically for solar cells. The list is expected next month, meaning tenders floated from October onward will be required to use Indian-made solar cells.

Hyundai Motor shares rally 3% as Goldman Sachs initiates coverage with buy rating,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/hyundai-motor-shares-rally-3-as-goldman-sachs-initiates-coverage-with-buy-rating-13440891.html,"Shares of Hyundai Motor India Ltd. gained as much as 3 percent to Rs 2,222 in morning deals on August 12, extending gains for a second consecutive session after Goldman Sachs initiated coverage with a buy recommendation, citing positive factors for growth. The international brokerage has set a price target of Rs 2,600 per share, implying an upside potential of 21 percent from the last close on the NSE. Goldman Sachs stated that the company has a strong positioning to outpace its peers, particularly in FY27–FY28. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates The brokerage expects growth to be driven by successful EV models, market share gains in emerging markets, and upcoming product launches, which could lift market share by 120 basis points between FY25 and FY28. Hyundai is projected to post over 8 percent volume CAGR over the next three years, compared to the domestic car industry’s 5.3 percent. While near-term startup costs are anticipated, Goldman Sachs believes they will be offset by an improved SUV and export mix, with the company also well-placed to benefit from a potential domestic car market upcycle in FY27. In the first quarter, Hyundai Motor India reported an 8.08 percent year-on-year drop in consolidated net profit to Rs 1,369.23 crore, weighed down by weak domestic sales. In the year-ago period, net profit stood at Rs 1,489.65 crore. Revenue from operations declined 5.37 percent to Rs 16,412.87 crore from Rs 17,344.23 crore in Q1 FY25. EBITDA fell 6.63 percent year-on-year to Rs 2,185.2 crore, while the operating margin narrowed by 20 basis points to 13.3 percent.

Overall volumes slipped 6.1 percent to 1,80,399 units. The Creta remained Hyundai’s top-selling SUV in the quarter with 47,662 units, followed by the Venue at 22,331 units and the Exter at 17,188 units. The company’s portfolio includes 12 ICE models — such as the Grand i10 Nios, Verna, Creta and Alcazar — and two EVs, the Creta Electric and Ioniq 5.

In the same quarter last fiscal, the company had reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 174 crore. Technical View Nifty, after slipping to a low of 24,350 in the previous session, staged a strong rebound to close near the 24,600 mark, easing sentiment to some extent. A decisive move above 24,630 would be needed to strengthen the bias, while immediate support lies at 24,300. Sustaining this level could pave the way for further gains in the coming sessions. Bank Nifty also recovered, taking support at its 100-EMA level of 54,950. The index faces stiff resistance around 56,000, with crucial support at 54,900. For the day, Nifty is expected to trade in the 24,400–24,800 range, while Bank Nifty’s range is seen between 54,800 and 56,200. Tata Steel, Hero MotoCorp, Titan Company, Tech Mahindra, TCS and Reliance Industries were the top gainers on the Nifty. Laggards on the index included Bajaj Finance, Dr Reddy's, Grasim, Eternal, Hindalco, and Adani Enterprises.

"Sensex, Nifty to open marginally higher; key levels to track on August 12",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sensex-nifty-to-open-marginally-higher-key-levels-to-track-on-august-12-13440374.html,"Benchmark indices Nifty and Sensex are set for a positive start on Tuesday, August 12, building on the momentum from Monday’s strong opening to the week. Around 8 am, GIFT Nifty was up 26 points, or 0.1 percent, at 24,597, signalling a steady opening for domestic equities. Bulls staged a strong comeback on August 11, with benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty climbing nearly a percent each, driven by robust buying in PSU banking, realty, and auto stocks. The rebound came as investors shook off last week’s tariff-induced volatility, which had pushed the Nifty to a three-month low and resulted in the index’s longest weekly losing streak in five years. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Foreign Institutional Investors stood as net sellers of equity shares worth Rs 1,202 crore. On the other hand, the market was buoyed by continued positive interest from Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) as they were net buyers of equity shares worth Rs 5,972 crore. Here are the key levels to watch out for in today's session Nifty, after slipping to a low of 24,350 in the previous session, staged a strong rebound to close near the 24,600 mark, easing sentiment to some extent. A decisive move above 24,630 would be needed to strengthen the bias, while immediate support lies at 24,300. Sustaining this level could pave the way for further gains in the coming sessions. Bank Nifty also recovered, taking support at its 100-EMA level of 54,950. The index faces stiff resistance around 56,000, with crucial support at 54,900. For the day, Nifty is expected to trade in the 24,400–24,800 range, while Bank Nifty’s range is seen between 54,800 and 56,200. The fear gauge, India VIX, extended its upward journey for another session, climbing to an intraday high of 12.73 before closing at 12.22, up 1.54 percent. The index sustained above short-term moving averages, signalling caution for bulls. Also read: Trump extends tariff deadline for China by another 90 days The Nifty Put-Call ratio (PCR), which indicates the mood of the market, jumped to 1.03 on August 11, compared to 0.66 in the previous session.

About 1,479 shares advanced compared to 1,255 declining shares on the NSE. The market may remain consolidative and rangebound until it gives a strong close above all key moving averages. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Mehul Kothari, Senior Technical Analyst at Anand Rathi HCL Technologies | CMP: Rs 1,488 HCL Technologies has witnessed a sharp correction of around 17 percent from its recent peak near Rs 1,752. Over the past 7–8 sessions, the stock has consistently held near the 0.618 retracement level, which also coincides with the gap formed on April 22–23, 2025. Notably, prices are trading well below the 100- and 200-day exponential moving averages, indicating the potential for a mean reversion. On the daily charts, the RSI is forming a complex “W” pattern below the oversold threshold of 30, while bullish divergence is visible on the hourly chart. These technical cues suggest a possible rebound. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 1,490–1,450 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,600 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,400 Bharat Petroleum Corporation | CMP: Rs 321 BPCL has recently found strong support, aligning with multiple technical indicators. The price has rebounded from a key trendline, the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level, and the 100-day exponential moving average (DEMA), all converging to reinforce this support zone. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has formed a hidden bullish divergence, indicating that underlying momentum is improving despite recent price weakness. This setup suggests a favourable risk-reward scenario for short-term traders. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 322–318 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 350 Stop-Loss: Rs 300 Titan Company | CMP: Rs 3,467.9 Titan has found support at a confluence of crucial technical levels, raising the likelihood of a short-term recovery. The stock has rebounded from a falling trendline, the 0.50 Fibonacci retracement, and the combined backing of the 100-day and 200-day exponential moving averages (DEMA). This convergence of supports reflects strong buying interest in the current range. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has displayed a hidden bullish divergence, signalling underlying strength despite recent price weakness. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 3,475–3,425 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,750 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,300 Jay Thakkar, Vice President & Head of Derivatives and Quant Research at ICICI Securities Indian Bank | CMP: Rs 674 Indian Bank has provided a breakout from a Rs 50 range and has managed to close above it as well. There has been long buildup in this stock, and with this breakout, long positions are likely to be added, which will provide support at lower levels. There has been significant Put addition from the Rs 630 to Rs 660 strikes, which is a good support range. Meanwhile, the Rs 670 and Rs 680 strikes have a huge Call base, so above those levels, further upward momentum is expected. The stock is trading well above its 20-day VWAP (volume-weighted average price) as well as its maximum pain level, thus confirming an upward breakout. Buy Indian Bank Futures in the range of Rs 680–675. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 700, Rs 725 Stop-Loss: Rs 659 InterGlobe Aviation | CMP: Rs 5,878.5 IndiGo has been consolidating in the range of Rs 5,900 to Rs 5,700 levels, and the stock has been witnessing long buildup, so the breakout is likely to be on the upside. There has been Call unwinding on the lower side, while Put additions have been observed from Rs 5,500 to Rs 5,900 levels. Hence, these levels will act as crucial support. However, Rs 5,900 and Rs 6,000 levels have a significant Call base as well, so a clear breakout will only occur above those levels. Since the stock is trading with a positive bias, the breakout is likely to be on the upside. Buy IndiGo Futures in the range of Rs 5,855 to Rs 5,870. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 6,050, Rs 6,150 Stop-Loss: Rs 5,750 Larsen & Toubro | CMP: Rs 3,668.4 Larsen & Toubro has reversed in the upward direction with a gap post its results. Overall, there has been long buildup in the stock; hence, the medium-term trend is positive. There was some correction due to long unwinding; however, post-results and following some fresh order confirmations, the stock has reversed and turned momentum upward. The stock was consolidating in a narrow range; however, a breakout has occurred, and further long buildup is expected. As per the options data, the Rs 3,700 strike has a huge Call base, so above those levels, further momentum is expected. The stock is trading well above its 20-day VWAP and maximum pain level, hence there is good support on the lower side, making the risk-to-reward ratio favourable for long positions. Buy Larsen & Toubro in the range of Rs 3,665 to Rs 3,675. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,770, Rs 3,820 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,690 Vidnyan S Sawant, Head of Research at GEPL Capital Transrail Lighting | CMP: Rs 798.9 Transrail Lighting is displaying a constructive price structure, consistently forming higher highs and higher lows, reflecting sustained buying interest and positive market sentiment. On the weekly chart, the stock has witnessed a bullish polarity shift, where previous resistance levels have turned into support — a sign of strengthening trend conviction. Additionally, it continues to trade well above its 12- and 26-week EMA levels — a technical setup that typically signals strong medium-term momentum. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 918 Stop-Loss: Rs 750 Fortis Healthcare | CMP: Rs 920.65 Fortis has shown remarkable resilience and strength, outperforming the broader market even during phases of overall weakness. The stock is trading well above its 12-, 26-, and 50-week EMAs, a technical configuration that underscores the stability and strength of its prevailing uptrend. Currently at lifetime highs, it sustains a robust higher-high, higher-low formation — a classic hallmark of a bullish price structure. The MACD indicator remains in positive territory with an upward slope, further validating the presence of strong bullish momentum. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,031 Stop-Loss: Rs 874 One 97 Communications | CMP: Rs 1,122 Paytm is exhibiting a robust positive price structure on the weekly chart, maintaining a pattern of higher highs and higher lows. On the daily timeframe, the stock has staged a bullish mean reversion from the 12-day EMA, supported by a notable rise in volumes above the 20-day average. It continues to hold firmly above the 5-, 12-, and 26-week EMAs, underscoring the strength of its underlying trend. The MACD remains in buy mode, indicating sustained bullish momentum and the potential for further upside. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,232 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,075 GMDC | CMP: Rs 418.3 Gujarat Mineral Development Corporation is exhibiting a bullish polarity shift, with the previous resistance levels of November and December 2024 now serving as strong support in July and August 2025. The weekly chart shows a steady pattern of higher highs and higher lows, reflecting a firmly established uptrend backed by consistent institutional participation. The stock trades comfortably above its 5-, 12-, 25-, and 50-week EMAs, underscoring the strength of the prevailing trend and limiting downside risk.

The company is aiming to defend volumes through tariff mitigation strategies, after it shared that the Q1FY26 adjusted EBITDA includes a net negative tariff impact of $28 million. The Hindalco subsidiary has projected the FY26 capex to be in the range of $1.9-2.2 billion. Novelis CFO Dev Ahuja said the company is 'finding opportunities' to streamline costs, in response to the 'challenging external environment'. US President Trump’s 50 percent tariff on steel and aluminium is expected to impact prices of electronics, cars and several other products. The management said it is confident of 'resilient' demand for aluminium packaging, and sees strong growth to continue in packaging. ""We continue to see strong demand for aluminum beverage packaging sheet supporting top-line growth and the need for new capacity under construction at our plant in Bay Minette, Alabama,"" Steve Fisher, President and CEO of Novelis Inc said. High prices for aluminium scrap hurt the financial performance for the June quarter, but the company is making 'solid progress' on cost reduction which is expected to lower cost base and improve margins, the CEO added. Novelis added that it is looking to accelerate cost reduction steps, which can drive higher cost savings in FY26, and over $300 million by end of FY28. Due to tariff-related uncertainty, Novelis had withheld volume and margin guidance for FY26.","The company is aiming to defend volumes through tariff mitigation strategies, after it shared that the Q1FY26 adjusted EBITDA includes a net negative tariff impact of $28 million.","High prices for aluminium scrap hurt the financial performance for the June quarter, but the company is making 'solid progress' on cost reduction which is expected to lower cost base and improve margins, the CEO added.","Novelis told analysts during an investor call on August 11 after June quarter earnings that despite tariff-related pressures, the aluminium smelting company is eyeing long-term growth through its Alabama greenfield rolling and recycling plant that will have a 600kt capacity upon completion.","High prices for aluminium scrap hurt the financial performance for the June quarter, but the company is making 'solid progress' on cost reduction which is expected to lower cost base and improve margins, the CEO added."

Among sectors, almost all the major sectoral indices traded in positive territory, but the PSU Bank index outperformed, rallying over 2 percent. Technically, after a long correction, the market has formed a reversal pattern on daily charts. Additionally, a bullish candle on daily charts also supports further uptrend from the current levels. We believe that 24,500/80400 and 24,445/80200 would act as key support zones for day traders. Above these levels, the pullback move is likely to continue till 24,700-24,750/81000-81200. On the flip side, below 24,445/80200, sentiment could turn negative. Traders may then prefer to exit their long positions. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The Nifty picked up right where it left off on Friday, but with an entirely different mood. Rising from the ashes, the index staged a spirited comeback, adding nearly 200 points through the day. The earlier breakdown now seems to have given way to a short-term pullback, as the market brushed aside recent weakness. We’re not completely out of the woods yet, but Monday’s bounce from the recent low carries enough steam to power further gains. Immediate support lies at 24,337, with the next upside targets seen around 24,850 and 25,000.

The sharp rise in the share prices pushed the Nifty Defence index up nearly 1.3 percent, snapping a three-session losing streak.

Solar Industries and Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders were up nearly 3 percent, while GRSE and Zen Tech gained nearly 2 percent. Heavyweights Bharat Dynamics (BDL) and Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) were up around 1 percent each. Here are the likely triggers for the sharp rise in the share prices: India's annual defence production hits all time high in FY25: Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh took to X platform on August 9 (Saturday) to announce that India’s annual defence production soared to an all-time high of Rs 1.51 lakh crore in FY25. This marks a strong growth of 18 percent from the Rs 1.27 lakh crore annual output reported for FY24. The defence production rose a whopping 90 percent on-year from the Rs 79,071 crore output reported for FY20. ""I commend the collective efforts of the Department of DefenceProduction and all stakeholders i.e., DPSUs, public sector manufacturers, and the private industry in achieving this landmark. This upward trajectory is a clear indicator of India's strengthening defence industrial base,"" the defence minister wrote in a post on X.Under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri @narendramodi India’s defence production has hit a record high! The annual defence production has soared to an all-time high figure of Rs 1,50,590 crore in the Financial Year (FY) 2024-25. These numbers indicate a robust 18% growth… — Rajnath Singh (@rajnathsingh) August 9, 2025 DRDO chief praises Indian defence equipment’s success during Operation Sindoor: Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) Chairman Samir Kamat on August 9 (Saturday) said BrahMos missiles and the Akashteer defence systems played key roles in 'Operation Sindoor'. ""Operation Sindoor was more than a mission. It was a declaration of India’s ability to stand tall through self-reliance, strategic foresight, and indigenous technological strength. It was a statement to the world that India has the capability to protect its borders through homegrown technology,"" he said while speaking at 14th convocation ceremony of Defence Institute of Advanced Technology (DIAT) in Pune. Kamat explained how BrahMos missile was used as the primary offensive weapon, while anti-drone Akashteer was used for defence. Bharat Dynamics Limited (BDL) manufactures the BrahMos missile. Pakistan's threat to ‘blow up’ Indian dam: Pakistan’s Army Chief Asim Munir has vowed to destroy any dam or water infrastructure India might build on the Indus water channels, following New Delhi’s decision to place the Indus Waters Treaty into abeyance after the April Pahalgam terror attack. Speaking at an event in US, Munir said, ""We will wait for India to build a dam, and when it does so, phir das missile sey faarigh kar dengey (we will destroy it with 10 missiles) … The Indus River is not the Indians’ family property. Humein missilon ki kami nahin hai (we have no shortage of missiles),"" Munir reportedly said, while claiming that India’s move could put 250 million Pakistanis at risk of starvation. The latest threat from the Pakistani army chief has reignited possibility of escalations in geopolitical tensions, which may in turn boost the defence stocks. Defence shares earlier came in focus after the Indian military in May conducted targeted strikes against terrorist outfits in Pakistan and Pakistan occupied Kashmir under the codename 'Operation Sindoor'. As the geopolitical tensions between India and Pakistan eased, the escalating wars between Russia-Ukraine and Israel- Iran further boosted the stocks. However, investors resorted to profit booking recently as geopolitical tensions eased around the globe. Earnings: The sharp rise in share prices also comes as strong earnings by some of the notable players boosted investor sentiment. BEML on August 11 reported a net loss of Rs 64 crore for the April-June quarter of FY26. This marks a notable decline from the Rs 70.5 crore net loss reported for the corresponding quarter of FY25. Revenue from operations were unchanged at Rs 634 crore. GRSE on August 8 reported a net profit of Rs 120 crore for Q1 FY26. This marks a 38 percent on-year rise from the Rs 87 crore net profit reported in Q1 FY25. However, net profit nearly halved sequentially from the Rs 244 crore reported in Q4 FY25. BEML is set to announce its results for the April-June quarter of FY25 today. Value buying: Defence stocks have seen significant correction recently. After rallying a whopping 42 percent since beginning of the year to hit a record high in June, the Nifty India Defence index dropped more than 17 percent as analysts flagged stretched valuations. However, investors may have taken a relook at the stocks after the significant correction, pushing the stocks higher on value buying.

NSDL shares close in red for the first time after 62% rally since listing; what lies ahead?,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/nsdl-sees-profit-booking-after-delivering-62-post-listing-gains-stocks-falls-8-from-day-s-high-what-lies-ahead-13434761.html,"The shares of National Securities Depository (NSDL) saw some profit booking on August 11, dropping nearly 11 percent from its day’s high to close in the red for the first time ever. This comes after a record rally of nearly 62 percent since listing. The shares of the company dropped 2 percent to close at Rs 1,273 apiece. Earlier in the day, the stock had jumped nearly 10 percent to trade at Rs 1,425 apiece. The newly listed stock has now declined nearly 8.5 percent from that level. The shares of NSDL had made a decent stock market debut on August 6, listing at Rs 880 apiece on BSE. This marked a premium of 10 percent over its IPO price at Rs 880 apiece. The listing premium was lower than grey market estimates. Analysts had recommended investors to consider holding the stock for the long term, given NSDL’s strong fundamentals and leadership in the depository segment. NSDL’s P/E ratio currently stands at around 79, higher than that of peer CDSL whose P/E ratio currently stands at around 66. What lies ahead? ""As one of only two depositories operating in a near-duopoly alongside CDSL, NSDL enjoys strong pricing power, high entry barriers, and a dominant share in value-based transactions and institutional account holdings,"" said Bhavik Joshi, Business Head, INVasset PMS. He noted that the stock's current P/E multiple of around 77 may appear stretched when compared to CDSL’s 66, but investors are clearly willing to pay a premium for its scale, technology backbone, and long-standing trust within the ecosystem. ""That said, prospective investors should be mindful of certain structural risks — dependence on transaction volumes, evolving investor participation patterns, and the ever-present cybersecurity and regulatory compliance requirements. In the near term, valuations may moderate if market activity slows, offering potential entry points for those who missed the IPO,"" he added. Nitin Jain, Senior Research Analyst at Bonanza, said it is recommended for short-term and listing-gain-focused investors to book some profits. ""The near-term upside may be capped after such a sharp move, and markets tend to see consolidation post a robust debut. If you are a long-term investor willing to ride out near-term volatility, NSDL remains a high-quality stock supported by rising demat penetration,"" he added. NSDL shares are now more expensive than its peer CDSL after its sharp rally, market expert Ambareesh Baliga told CNBC-TV18. ""I think along with long investors shifting from CDSL to NSDL post listing, we have seen huge number of momentum trader getting in, which has pushed the stock higher. So, it will be ideal for IPO investors to book profits at current levels and make a shift back to CDSL,"" he said. Long term investors should use the dips to accumulate further, while short term investors should book profits after the record rally, Sunny Agarwal of SBI Securities told CNBC-TV18.

So far in 2025, the stock has fallen 33 percent, underperforming the Nifty 50 index’s 2 percent gain. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog CLSA maintained a “hold” rating but cut its target price to Rs 1,170 per share, citing a 20 percent year-on-year drop in revenue and a 400 basis point fall in EBITDA margin. The Unitary Cooling Products (UCP) segment’s revenue fell 25 percent year-on-year, with margins plunging to a 10-year low of 3.6 percent. Market share dropped to 17.8 percent from 19.5 percent. CLSA expects recovery from Q3 onwards but sees flat to a 10 percent decline in full-year industry growth, with high inventories continuing to weigh on utilisation and margins. Nomura retained its “neutral” rating with a target price of Rs 1,317 per share. It said Q1FY26 UCP margins missed sharply and warned that competitive intensity may keep margins under pressure despite recovery hopes. The brokerage cut its FY26 revenue growth forecast for room air conditioners to 5 percent, while keeping FY27 and FY28 estimates at 20 percent and 15 percent respectively. It also lowered UCP revenue growth forecasts to 6 percent for FY26 and 24 percent for FY27. In Q1FY26, Voltas’ net profit slumped 58 percent year-on-year to Rs 140.6 crore from Rs 334 crore in the same quarter last year, as unseasonal weather and muted summer demand hit cooling product sales. Revenue fell 20 percent to Rs 3,938.6 crore, while EBITDA halved to Rs 178.6 crore. Operating margins contracted to 4.5 percent from 8.6 percent a year earlier. Management attributed the weak performance to a delayed summer and early monsoon, which dented air-conditioner sales. A high base from last year—when prolonged heat waves boosted record demand—further amplified the decline.

Manappuram Finance shares fall 3% as brokerages turn cautious on dismal Q1 results,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/manappuram-finance-shares-fall-3-as-brokerages-turn-cautious-on-dismal-q1-results-13433991.html,"Shares of Manappuram Finance fell 3 percent to Rs 251 apiece on August 11 after the company reported weak June quarter (Q1FY26) results. Brokerages stayed in a wait-and-watch mode, with management indicating that the worst phase is over and profitability is expected to return by the fourth quarter of FY26. Jefferies maintained a “hold” call but raised its target price to Rs 275 per share. It said Q1 profit after tax was in line with estimates as weaker net interest income (NII) was offset by lower provisions in the microfinance (MFI) segment. Gold loans grew 12 percent quarter-on-quarter, mainly due to higher prices. However, customer growth was muted despite yield cuts. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog The brokerage noted that lower NIMs, unwinding of non-gold loans, and elevated MFI provisions will weigh on earnings. While valuations appear reasonable, Jefferies said more clarity on the turnaround under the new CEO is crucial for a re-rating. CLSA retained its “outperform” rating with a target price of Rs 260 per share. It said Q1FY26 pre-provision operating profit (PPoP) and net profit missed estimates by 9 percent due to sharper-than-expected declines in yields and spreads. Management has trimmed lending rates across high-ticket loans and plans further cuts to around 18 percent over the next four to six quarters. Loan growth of 13 percent quarter-on-quarter was driven entirely by higher ticket sizes, while the Asirvad MFI business saw a 23 percent sequential decline in its loan book. CLSA echoed management’s view that the worst is behind and profitability should return by Q4FY26. In Q1FY26, Manappuram Finance’s net profit fell 75 percent year-on-year to Rs 138 crore from Rs 555 crore in the same quarter last year. Revenue from operations declined 9 percent to Rs 2,262 crore.

"SBI shares gain, emerges top Nifty gainer as brokerages cheer steady Q1 results",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sbi-shares-in-focus-as-brokerages-remain-bullish-on-beat-q1-profit-stable-asset-quality-13432664.html,"Shares of State Bank of India (SBI) gained by a percent to Rs 816 on August 11 after the lender reported steady June quarter results, with higher treasury income helping profit surpass Street expectations. Analysts remain largely positive, pointing to the management’s guidance on stable asset quality and margins as important positives. HSBC maintained a “buy” rating with a target price of Rs 960 per share, saying the bank is well-positioned to deliver healthy loan growth while safeguarding margins. CLSA also gave a “buy” call with a target price of Rs 1,050 per share, highlighting stable asset quality. The brokerage noted that SBI’s pre-tax profit beat estimates by 32 percent, supported by core pre-provision operating profit (PPoP) and benign credit costs. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog Jefferies was equally upbeat, with a “buy” rating and a target of Rs 970 per share, citing management’s retained return on assets (RoA) guidance of 1 percent and domestic net interest margin (NIM) guidance of 3 percent. On the other hand, UBS adopted a more cautious stance with a “neutral” rating and a target price of Rs 880 per share, noting that business growth was modest and the loan-to-deposit ratio moderated by 70 basis points quarter-on-quarter. Bernstein also maintained a “market perform” rating, with a target price of Rs 800 per share. The brokerage said loan and deposit growth of 12 percent came at the expense of a sharper margin drop, adding that core profitability remains weak, though non-interest income gains and recoveries helped sustain RoA. In Q1, SBI’s net profit rose 12 percent to Rs 19,160 crore from Rs 17,035 crore a year ago, driven by strong treasury gains and retail loan growth. The quarter saw significant gains from the sale of government securities, supported by policy rate cuts totaling 75 basis points, along with higher foreign exchange trading income. The NIM fell to 3.02 percent from 3.35 percent a year earlier, reflecting lower returns on domestic advances while deposit costs stayed high.

US Equities (Up) US stocks ended higher, and the Nasdaq notched a record closing high for the second straight day on Friday as technology-related shares, including Apple, gained, and as investors were optimistic about potential interest rate cuts. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 206.97 points, or 0.47%, to 44,175.61, the S&P 500 gained 49.45 points, or 0.78%, to 6,389.45, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 207.32 points, or 0.98%, to 21,450.02.

Gold (Down) In commodity markets, gold dipped to $ 3,376 an ounce after wild swings last week on reports that the U.S. would slap 39% tariffs on some gold bars, which are major exports of Switzerland.

"Asian stocks edge up before key data, oil falls",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/asian-stocks-edge-up-before-key-data-oil-falls-13431994.html,"Asian shares posted a modest gain at the open as investors stayed cautious ahead of key economic data this week and a looming deadline for the potential extension of US tariffs on Chinese exports. Stocks rose in Australia while South Korea fluctuated. Oil fell 0.7%, the seventh decline in eight days, ahead of US-Russia talks. There will be no cash trading in Treasuries during Asian hours due to a holiday in Japan. Gold futures in New York steadied as traders awaited clarification from the White House over its tariff policy. Contracts for the S&P 500 edged up 0.1%. Asian lithium stocks rose after Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. suspended production at a major mine in China’s Jiangxi province for at least three months, a move that may ease oversupply concerns. The modest moves came as traders awaited critical US economic releases that could shape interest-rate expectations, while a looming tariff deadline may influence trading sentiment. A key focus will be the US inflation report, expected to offer further insight into the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate path amid concerns the economy is teetering on the edge of stagflation. “Stagflation creates a dilemma for the Federal Reserve as it challenges their dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability,” Joe Unwin, head of portfolio management at Apostle Funds Management, wrote in a note. “This could lead to a scenario where interest rates remain elevated despite weaker economic growth, which would be bearish for almost all traditional asset classes.” Oil fell after its biggest weekly drop since end-June before a meeting between the US and Russian leaders on Friday, which is raising the prospect of an end to the war in Ukraine and more supply. Brent traded near $66 a barrel, after sliding 4.4% last week, while West Texas Intermediate was above $63. Technology stocks will be in focus after Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. agreed to pay 15% of their revenues from chip sales to China to the US government as part of a deal with the Trump administration to secure export licenses. Chinese retail sales and industrial production data due later this week will be parsed after consumer and producer price data at the weekend indicated demand remains fragile. Traders are also waiting for confirmation that the Aug. 12 deadline for talks on US duties on Chinese imports will be extended. “The market has fully subscribed to the high probability of the tariff truce being rolled over for another 90 days,” said Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone Group in Melbourne. Elsewhere, Australia’s central bank is expected to ease policy on Tuesday as inflationary pressures ebb. Still, Governor Michele Bullock is expected to stick with her cautious stance on the monetary policy outlook.","A key focus will be the US inflation report, expected to offer further insight into the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate path amid concerns the economy is teetering on the edge of stagflation.",Asian shares posted a modest gain at the open as investors stayed cautious ahead of key economic data this week and a looming deadline for the potential extension of US tariffs on Chinese exports.,"The modest moves came as traders awaited critical US economic releases that could shape interest-rate expectations, while a looming tariff deadline may influence trading sentiment.","“This could lead to a scenario where interest rates remain elevated despite weaker economic growth, which would be bearish for almost all traditional asset classes.” Oil fell after its biggest weekly drop since end-June before a meeting between the US and Russian leaders on Friday, which is raising the prospect of an end to the war in Ukraine and more supply."
"Nearly 750 stocks crash over 50% from 52-week highs; small caps bear maximum brunt, financials, infra lead losses",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/nearly-750-stocks-crash-over-50-from-52-week-highs-small-caps-bear-maximum-brunt-financials-infra-lead-losses-13431892.html,"Nearly 750 stocks -- 743 to be precise -- led by small caps and financials, have dropped over 50% from their respective 52-week highs even as benchmark indices remain mostly stable, despite global market concerns. Data from Ace Equity shows that small caps make up more than four-fifths of these declines, highlighting sector-wide pressure from muted earnings, tariff concerns and stretched valuations. Of the nearly 4,000 listed companies, data shows that all companies have seen a decline from their highs, out of which 743 are down more than 50 percent. Further, of the 743 companies, more than 82 percent or 614 entities are small caps. Mid-caps account for 95 companies, while 34 large-cap stocks, typically considered safer bets, have also shed more than half their value. Biggest individual losersKesoram Industries recorded the steepest fall, collapsing 97.8% from Rs 235.95 to Rs 5.12 amid debt issues and weakening fundamentals. Spright Agro dropped 95.8% from Rs 44.66 to Rs 1.87, while Vantage Knowledge Academy and AGS Transact Technologies fell 95.7% and 95.6%, respectively. Other companies such as Bharat Global Developers, Mercury Trade Links, Sunshine Capital, Sadhana Nitro Chem, AF Enterprises, Money Masters Leasing & Finance, and K&R Rail Engineering also lost over 90% of their market value. Even some large and well-known names have suffered losses (of less than 10 percent) from the 52-week high. PB Fintech, operator of Policy bazaar, and Gland Pharma have both fallen more than 8%. According to Sunny Agrawal, Head of Fundamental Research at SBI Securities “The Indian equity market, post scaling new life highs in September 2024, witnessed correction due to slower earnings growth from a government capex slowdown, relatively expensive valuations compared to MSCI EM indices, and a globally uncertain environment post the election of Mr Trump. Some madcaps and small caps have seen steep correction due to a combination of weak earnings and froth in valuations.” Financials and infra lead the fallThe financial services sector tops the list with 132 stocks down more than 50%, including AGS Transact, AME Fin trade India and Aretha Finest, which saw declines of 85–95% on regulatory pressures and funding constraints. Industrial and infrastructure names follow closely, with 121 companies in the red. Udayshivakumar Infra, a recent IPO, has plunged over 90%, while VRC Construction and Bharat Global Developers have been dragged down by project delays and weak balance sheets. IT and digital services (79 stocks) have seen post-pandemic valuation corrections. Consumer and retail (64) have been weighed down by weak demand and higher costs, hitting Add-Shop E-Retail, SM Gold and Karim India. Pharma and healthcare (49) have suffered from price erosion and slowing overseas demand, dragging down Gland Pharma, Laurus Labs and Marksans Pharma. Real estate and construction (58) saw DB Realty, Ajmera Realty and Godrej Properties drop 55–70% on high debt and muted launches. Education and training (22) posted some of the steepest losses, with Vantage Knowledge Academy and CL Educate down over 90%. Agriculture and FMCG (39) were hurt by commodity volatility, while 27 media and entertainment stocks also fell more than 50%. Analysts flag multiple pressure pointsShrikant Chouhan, Executive Vice President and Head of Equity Research at Kotak Securities, said the sell-off is driven by “a confluence of weak earnings, trade tensions, and valuation resets.” He pointed to India’s looming 50% tariff risk on exports to the US affecting 70% of outbound shipments and the rupee at 88 as factors hitting sentiment. “With most uncertainties now known, Q2 could show improvement, and our strategy should be bought on dips,” he added. Narendra Solanki, Head of Fundamental Research at Anand Rathi Stock Brokers believes that part of the correction reflects a necessary rebound after post-Covid valuation exuberance. “Many stocks saw significant run-up post-Covid due to high growth and macro tailwinds. Liquidity-driven optimism pushed valuations too high, making them susceptible,” he said, adding that diminished global liquidity and FII outflows are intensifying the downturn. Market watchers are closely tracking ingenious support levels at 23,700 and 24,000, with resistance seen at 25,000–25,500. Analysts believe domestic institutional inflows could help cushion further declines, and that any positive surprises in Q2 earnings or policy announcements might trigger a rebound.

Bears maintained their dominance over the market breadth, with about 1,808 shares declining compared to 877 rising shares on the NSE. The market may attempt a bounce back after six weeks of consistent losses, but sustainability will be the key to watch. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Rajesh Palviya, Senior Vice President Research (Head Technical Derivatives) at Axis Securities Sanghvi Movers | CMP: Rs 307.7 Sanghvi Movers registered 17.5% gains last week. With this strong buying momentum, the stock has experienced a trend reversal, as it has decisively broken out past a one-and-a-half-year ""down-sloping trendline resistance"" at Rs 292 on a weekly closing basis. Huge volumes on this breakout signify increased participation. The stock is well placed above its 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-day SMAs, which reconfirms a bullish trend. These averages are also inching up along with the price rise, further reinforcing bullish sentiment. The daily, weekly, and monthly strength indicator RSI indicates rising strength. The daily ""Bollinger Bands"" buy signal signifies increased momentum. Investors should consider buying, holding, and accumulating this stock. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 350, Rs 385 Stop-Loss: Rs 280 Kajaria Ceramics | CMP: Rs 1,308.5 Kajaria Ceramics, with the past couple of sessions' up-move, has decisively surpassed the ""multiple resistance"" zone of Rs 1,267 on a closing basis, indicating a strong comeback by bulls. Over the past couple of months, rising volumes have signified increased participation. The stock is well placed above its 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-day SMAs, reaffirming a bullish trend. These averages are also inching up along with the price rise, reinforcing bullish sentiment. The daily, weekly, and monthly strength indicator RSI indicates rising strength. The daily ""Bollinger Bands"" buy signal signifies increased momentum. Investors should consider buying, holding, and accumulating this stock. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,420, Rs 1,500 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,267 TVS Motor Company | CMP: Rs 2,968.9 TVS Motor Company, with last week's price action, has confirmed a ""Cup and Handle"" formation breakout at Rs 2,965 on a closing basis. The past couple of weeks' rising volumes show increased participation. The stock is well placed above its 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-day SMAs, reaffirming a bullish trend. These averages are also inching up along with the price rise, reinforcing bullish sentiment. The daily ""Bollinger Bands"" buy signal signifies increased momentum. Investors should consider buying, holding, and accumulating this stock. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,100, Rs 3,250 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,880 Rajesh Bhosale, Technical Analyst at Angel One Tech Mahindra | CMP: Rs 1,480.4 From the April swing low near Rs 1,180 to the June peak around Rs 1,700, Tech Mahindra saw a strong rally, followed by a month-long price correction. This week, after testing the 50% retracement level of that advance, prices staged a solid rebound, forming a bullish engulfing pattern on the weekly chart. The formation of this pattern at a key support zone signals a potential resumption of the uptrend. Notably, this support aligns with the 89-WEMA, further reinforcing the bullish outlook. On the momentum side, the RSI Smoothened has generated a fresh buy signal from the oversold territory, lending additional confirmation to the positive view. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,600 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,420 Indian Bank | CMP: Rs 650.85 Despite weakness in the broader banking space over the past couple of months, Indian Bank has stood out with notable relative strength, consistently holding above its multi-month bullish breakout zone. This week, while the overall market came under pressure, the stock gained over 4%, breaking out of consolidation and confirming a Flag pattern on the weekly chart — a classic continuation signal in an uptrend. On the momentum front, monthly and weekly RSI readings remain firmly above 80, underscoring strong bullish sentiment, while a pullback in the daily RSI toward 40 offers an attractive buy-on-dips opportunity. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 710 Stop-Loss: Rs 619 Anshul Jain, Head of Research at Lakshmishree Investments Global Health (Medanta) | CMP: Rs 1,423.2 Medanta has broken out of a 282-day-long rounding pattern with a massive volume surge — over 1,334% above the 50-day average — signaling strong institutional participation. The breakout coincides with stellar quarterly results, featuring 50% EPS growth year-on-year and sales rising over 20%. Moving averages and momentum indicators are bullishly aligned, providing additional support for further upside. This blend of powerful price action, extraordinary volumes, and strong fundamentals points to a potential sharp follow-through rally, offering an attractive setup for momentum traders aiming to capitalize on institutional buying and sustained market strength. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,650 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,300 Pidilite Industries | CMP: Rs 3,081.3 Pidilite, after a failed breakdown of its box pattern with boundaries at Rs 2,900–3,110, has rebounded sharply to test the box high. It is now consolidating near this upper boundary, forming an inside bar — a sign of controlled price action before a possible breakout. The reversal from the box low created a bear trap, adding strength to the structure. A decisive move above Rs 3,120 will confirm the breakout and likely accelerate momentum toward the Rs 3,400 zone. The price setup, coupled with the failure of bears to hold breakdown levels, signals strong underlying buying interest and bullish continuation potential.

OTM butterfly for slow market: Shubham Agarwal,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/expert-columns/otm-butterfly-for-slow-market-shubham-agarwal-13420465.html,"Butterfly is one of the most celebrated strategies after the margin benefits were introduced. Butterfly strategy is a strategy adopted by many option sellers. However, little credit has been given to Butterfly by Option buyers who are more interested in directional moves. Before we go into its use, let us understand what the Butterfly strategy is. Butterfly is a strategy that involves selling 2 options close to the current market price of the stock or index and buying a higher strike price option and a lower strike price option. A butterfly made with all calls is called a Call Butterfly, and with all Puts is called a Put Butterfly. The favourite of option sellers is selling both Call and Put of strike close to the current market price and buying a Higher strike Call and a Lower strike Put. This is called Iron Butterfly. For directional trades, we will restrict ourselves to Call and Put Butterfly, and we will go OTM. OTM or Out of the Money options are higher strike Call options and lower strike Put options. They are called OTM because if the stock had to expire exactly at the current price, these options would not make any money. Now, let us look at the slow-moving market to understand how OTM Butterflies can help. A slow-moving market, especially in the first half of the monthly expiry, is very difficult for a directional option trader. Especially when the premiums are too expensive due to a lot of time-related value in them. The first problem is cost. Second problem with these expensive options early in the expiry is that if it takes 2 weeks for the stock to move, the premium reduction due to passage of time is so severe that there is very little profit left for the trader despite the right call on direction. On the other hand, if we are towards the end of the expiry, the premiums are less expensive, but the loss due to the passage of time is very fast. In either case, the problem still remains of not being able to wait longer in the trade. Both are critical problems to be dealt with. Both of them can be cleared by a Call/Put Butterfly depending on the direction. Example of an OTM Call Butterfly Let us say you are bullish on a stock trading at 1000 with a target of 1040 1010 Call @ 13 1040 Call @ 5 1070 Call @ 2 Now, the choice is to buy 1010 Call at 13 and sit on it. 1040 comes after 20 days, and with 2-3 days to expiry, the Option trades around 30. Profit of 17. Or we create a Butterfly with Buy 1010, Sell 2 1040, and Buy 1070 Call. Ne Premium out is 5. Maximum profit = Diff between Buy and Sell strike (1040-1010 = 30) – Net Premium Paid (5) = 25. Here, if we go wrong, we lose 5 vs losing 13 in the Call bought. Also, the strategy on the day of expiry is profitable after 1015, whereas the 1010 Call on expiry is profitable only after 1023.

More than 40 small-cap stocks drop 10-24% amid tariff concerns,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/more-than-40-small-cap-stocks-drop-10-24-amid-tariff-concerns-13429906.html,"The broader indices underperformed the main indices and continued the fall in the third consecutive week, led by volatility amid better auto numbers, mixed earnings, and persistent FII selling after the US imposed additional tariffs on India. For the week, BSE Large-cap and Mid-cap indices shed 1 percent each, and the BSE Small-cap index slipped nearly 2 percent. For the week, the BSE Sensex index shed 742.12 points or 0.92 percent to finish at 79,857.79, while Nifty50 shed 202.05 points or 0.82 percent to end at 24,363.30. The Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) extended their selling in their sixth consecutive week, as they sold equities worth Rs 10,652.47 crore, despite remaining buyers in the final day of the week. On the other hand, Domestic Institutional Investors (DII) extended their buying in the 16th week, as they purchased equities worth Rs 33,608.66 crore. In this month on August so far, FII sold equities worth Rs 14,018.87 crore and DII bought equities worth Rs 36,795.52 crore. On the sectoral, Nifty Pharma, Realty, FMCG, Healthcare, lost 2 percent each, while PSU Bank, media, and metal rose 0.5-1.5 percent. ""Since July, the Indian equity market has remained in a phase of consolidation, reflecting weakening investor sentiment due to trade-aligned challenges. Concerns over steep US tariff rates and underwhelming quarterly earnings have dampened market confidence. Persistent selling by FIIs, particularly in pharma stocks with significant US exposure, underscores this cautious outlook. The continued depreciation of the INR has also added to investor anxiety,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments. ""Despite these headwinds, downside risks were partially cushioned by RBI’s reaffirmation of macroeconomic stability, its optimistic stance on domestic growth, and early signs of easing inflation. Looking ahead, market volatility is expected to persist. While risks from US trade tensions and sustained FII outflows remain, potential support from DIIs could offer some relief."" ""Upcoming inflation data from both India and the US will be critical in shaping investor expectations. Market participants are advised to closely track global trade developments and corporate earnings, with a strategic focus on domestic consumption-driven sectors that are better positioned to withstand short-term volatility,"" he added. The BSE Small-cap index slipped nearly 2 percent with PG Electroplast, Kitex Garments, Unichem Laboratories, Morepen Laboratories, Advait Energy Transitions, KR Rail Engineering, Faze Three, and Advanced Enzyme Technologies falling between 15-24 percent. However, Sarda Energy and Minerals, Timex Group India, Sanghvi Movers, Zinka Logistics Solutions, Centum Electronics, KRBL, Baazar Style Retail, Godfrey Phillips India, and Entertainment Network India gained between 12-21 percent. Where is Nifty50 headed? Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Lingering uncertainty over the tariff situation, coupled with continued selling by FIIs, has been weighing on market sentiment. The medium-term moving average—the 100-day EMA—near the 24,600 mark, which earlier acted as support, is now serving as an immediate resistance. A close below 24,450 signals the continuation of the corrective phase, with a potential retest of the long-term moving average—the 200-day EMA—near 24,200. Traders are advised to align their positions accordingly, with greater emphasis on risk management."" Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The Nifty moved southward as it failed to sustain above the 50 EMA on the hourly chart, indicating prevailing selling pressure. Moreover, the index closed below the crucial support level of 24,400, highlighting the strength of the bears. Sentiment was already tilted in favour of the bears, with the index forming a lower-top, lower-bottom pattern. The short-term trend remains weak, with potential downside towards 24,150–24,200. On the higher side, resistance is seen at 24,475–24,500. Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities After witnessing a sustainable bounce back from the lows on Thursday, Nifty witnessed sharp selloff on Friday. A long bear candle was formed on the daily chart that completely negated the bullish sentiment created on Thursday. A long negative candle has been formed on the weekly chart which is for the sixth consecutive week on the trot. The formation of long upper shadows in the last 4-5 weekly candles signals sell on every rise in the market. The underlying trend of Nifty continues to be weak. The next lower levels to be watched around 24200-24000 by next week. However, any pullback up to the hurdle of 24500 could be a sell on rise opportunity.

Management said ICE margins have been under stress for some time, with an additional blow from commodity inflation in the June quarter, driven mainly by higher steel prices, safeguard duty of 12 percent and forex risks.

Tata Motors races to secure rare earth magnet supply amid global risks,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/tata-motors-races-to-secure-rare-earth-magnet-supply-amid-global-risks-13425916.html,"Tata Motors is taking no chances with its electric vehicle supply chain, as rare earth magnets—vital for EV motors—emerge as a potential global choke point. While production remains unaffected for now, the company is already working on alternatives to secure future supplies. Group CFO P.B. Balaji, speaking on the Q1 FY26 earnings call, said the company is evaluating all options: ""Redesigning, including lighter ones, including different sources, including different substitutes being put in place."" Also read: FPIs have been sanguine about Indian markets: NSE CEO on market reaction to Trump tariffs The push comes amid rising global concern over China’s dominance in rare earth supplies, which could spark shortages or price spikes in the event of geopolitical tension. Tata Motors, along with its UK-based unit Jaguar Land Rover, is preparing to respond with a multi-pronged strategy—ranging from supplier diversification to component redesign. Domestically, the company said it is covered for the next 2-3 months, and it is looking at alternatives outside of China. Balaji pointed out that past experiences have shaped this proactive stance. ""The learnings coming from the semiconductor crisis have meant that we have been off the blocks quite fast. And that has helped us cope with this quite well, both here (at Tata Motors) and in JLR. And that is what we are executing.” For now, there is no change to Tata Motors’ production or launch plans, but the company isn’t waiting for disruptions to materialise. Apart from this, Jaguar Land Rover is staring at a roadblock in China after the government cut the luxury tax threshold from 1.3 million RMB (Chinese yuan) to 900,000 RMB, pulling almost all Range Rover sales into the tax net and adding an extra 10 percent levy in a market where retail finance remains tight.

Recent trade agreements have eased the blow from an initially proposed 1,000 percent hike, but duties will still rise sharply — about 300 percent for vehicles built in the UK and 500 percent for those from Europe. These tariffs directly raise the landed cost of JLR’s cars in the US, potentially squeezing margins and limiting pricing flexibility. A planned 15 percent reduction in these rates is yet to take effect, meaning elevated costs will persist in one of its most important overseas markets.

Losses were broad-based, with autos, metals, IT and pharma leading the decline. At close, the Sensex was down 765.47 points or 0.95 percent at 79,857.79, and the Nifty was down 232.85 points or 0.95 percent at 24,363.30.

Also read: SBI Q1 results: Net profit rises 12% to Rs 19,160 crore, beats estimates Stretched valuations in Indian equities are prompting persistent selling by foreign investors, who have been net sellers on every trading day so far in August, offloading a total of Rs 15,950 crore in the cash market. Thursday’s sharp 250-point rebound in the Nifty from its intraday low was largely driven by short covering, sparked by strong domestic institutional investor (DII) purchases worth Rs 10,864 crore. With market sentiment weighed down by tariff tensions between India and the US, FIIs are expected to keep trimming their cash market exposure. However, robust DII inflows, backed by steady mutual fund investments, are helping cushion the market and could prevent a deeper sell-off, V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments Ltd, said. Sectoral indices on the NSE were largely in the red, with realty (-1.93%), metal (-1.71%), consumer durables (-1.64%), and midcaps (-1.49%) seeing the sharpest losses. Auto, pharma, infrastructure, private banks, and IT stocks also weighed on sentiment, while PSU banks and media ended only marginally lower. The Nifty Bank fell 0.78 percent, while FMCG and energy slipped 0.72 percent and 0.53 percent, respectively. Oil & gas was the sole gainer, inching up 0.06 percent.

Intraday indicators also signal a reversal from oversold territory. The overall structure remains oversold, suggesting that any pullbacks may offer opportunities to initiate fresh long positions as optimism gradually returns,"" Dhupesh Dhameja of SAMCO Securities said.

Growth was led by textile & apparel, though garmenting faced headwinds due to uncertainty around the US tariffs. EBITDA grew 29% YoY, though 35% below our estimate as margins got impacted by higher marketing spends and scale deleverage in garmenting. Managementis confident of a margin recovery in 2H. Although the overall demand environment remains challenging, there are signs of improvement, with stronger momentum in order bookings. Post a sharp correction (down 46% YTD), its valuation appears attractive at ~19x FY27E PE or ~1x FY27 EV/sales. However, we believe improvement in execution and sustained growth recovery remain key for re-rating. We cut our FY26-27E EPS by ~11-14% due to weaker margins and the impact of the US tariff-related uncertainty in the garmenting segment. We build in ~9% revenue CAGR over FY25-28E, with margins expanding to 12.3% by FY28. Outlook We value RLL at 22x Sep’27E P/E to arrive at our revised TP of INR1,425.

Biocon gears up to ride weight-loss drug boom to script next growth chapter,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/biocon-gears-up-to-ride-weight-loss-drug-boom-to-script-next-growth-chapter-13423370.html,"Biocon is betting big on GLP-1 therapies and peptides to drive its next wave of growth, as global demand for weight-loss and diabetes treatments accelerates. The company is preparing for a day-one launch of semaglutide in select markets, with filings underway and approvals expected by late 2026 or early 2027, managing director and chief executive officer Siddharth Mittal told Moneycontrol. He was referring to the expiry of semaglutide patent in India and several other countries in 2026, which will pave the way for its generic versions. The Bengaluru-based drugmaker is also looking to fill the void left by multinational players as they pivot away from insulin to GLP-1 therapies, backed by expanded capacity in Malaysia and new approvals in the US, Europe and other markets. “We are the only other large insulin manufacturer with expanded capacity,” Mittal said in an interview. “We think we are very well placed to benefit from this refocus of innovators from insulin to GLP.” Biocon’s insulin manufacturing capacity expansion in Malaysia is expected to come online by the end of this fiscal, he said. The company is doubling the capacity to capture market share in geographies where multinational companies such as Novo Nordisk are exiting the insulin segment, particularly in human insulin. Biocon recently secured USFDA approval for Kirsty, its interchangeable biosimilar insulin aspart, and is preparing for a “meaningful launch” in the fiscal fourth quarter, aligned with contracting cycles. The company also received approval for liraglutide, which is used in treating type 2 diabetes, in India and Europe, with launches underway through commercialisation partners. Peptides and GLP-1s: The next frontier Biocon is building a robust pipeline of peptides targeting weight loss, diabetes, and dermatology. “We were the first company in the world to get generic liraglutide approved in an ICH market (like the UK, Europe and Canada),” Mittal said. Globally, the GLP-1 segment is booming, with liraglutide alone generating over $1.6 billion in annual sales. Biocon’s peptide capabilities are expected to play a pivotal role in capturing this opportunity. Its generics business is seeing traction from launches like lenalidomide, dasatinib in the US and liraglutide in the European Union. The company is also advancing approvals for rivaroxaban and everolimus in the US. “Pricing pressure is stable at 5–7 percent, but product-level dynamics vary,” Mittal said. Rivaroxaban is used to treat deep vein thrombosis. Everolimus is an immunosuppressant used to prevent rejection of organ transplants and also in the treatment of renal cell cancer and other tumours. In biosimilars, Biocon has launched Yesafili in Canada and received European approvals for denosumab. Its oncology portfolio continues to lead in the US, with Fulphila and Ogivri holding 27 percent market share each. Tariff preparedness While pharma remains exempt from US tariffs for now, Biocon is de-risking its supply chain. “We’ve got two facilities in the US, expanded oral solid dosage capacity in New Jersey, and local partnerships like Civica Rx for insulin manufacturing,” Mittal said. “We’re scenario-mapping but there’s a limit to how much we can do.” With a strong start to FY26, Biocon expects double-digit growth across biosimilars, generics, and CRDMO. The company raised Rs 4,500 crore through QIP, which has strengthened its balance sheet. The funds will be used to increase its stake in Biocon Biologics. “We’re aligning our business with shifting global policy and supply chain dynamics,” Mittal said. “The next few years will be about scaling what we’ve built and leading in the segments that matter.”","The company also received approval for liraglutide, which is used in treating type 2 diabetes, in India and Europe, with launches underway through commercialisation partners.","The Bengaluru-based drugmaker is also looking to fill the void left by multinational players as they pivot away from insulin to GLP-1 therapies, backed by expanded capacity in Malaysia and new approvals in the US, Europe and other markets.","Its oncology portfolio continues to lead in the US, with Fulphila and Ogivri holding 27 percent market share each.","The Bengaluru-based drugmaker is also looking to fill the void left by multinational players as they pivot away from insulin to GLP-1 therapies, backed by expanded capacity in Malaysia and new approvals in the US, Europe and other markets."

Musk posted the comments on X late Monday, saying, “Hey @Apple App Store, why do you refuse to put either X or Grok in your ‘Must Have’ section when X is the #1 news app in the world and Grok is #5 among all apps? Are you playing politics? What gives? Inquiring minds want to know.” Grok is owned by Musk's artificial intelligence startup xAI. Musk went on to say that “Apple is behaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store, which is an unequivocal antitrust violation. xAI will take immediate legal action.” He gave no further details. There was no immediate comment from Apple, which has faced various allegations of antitrust violations in recent years. A federal judge recently found that Apple violated a court injunction in an antitrust case filed by Fortnite maker Epic Games. Regulators of the 27-nation European Union fined Apple 500 million euros in April for breaking competition rules by preventing app makers from pointing users to cheaper options outside its App Store. Last year, the EU fined the U.S. tech giant nearly $2 billion for unfairly favoring its own music streaming service by forbidding rivals like Spotify from telling users how they could pay for cheaper subscriptions outside of iPhone apps. As of early Tuesday, the top app in Apple's App Store was TikTok, followed by Tinder, Duolingo, YouTube and Bumble. Open AI's ChatGPT was ranked 7th.","Billionaire SpaceX, Tesla and X owner Elon Musk says he plans to sue Apple for not featuring X and its Grok artificial intelligence chatbot app in its top recommended apps in its App Store.","Billionaire SpaceX, Tesla and X owner Elon Musk says he plans to sue Apple for not featuring X and its Grok artificial intelligence chatbot app in its top recommended apps in its App Store.","There was no immediate comment from Apple, which has faced various allegations of antitrust violations in recent years.","Musk posted the comments on X late Monday, saying, “Hey @Apple App Store, why do you refuse to put either X or Grok in your ‘Must Have’ section when X is the #1 news app in the world and Grok is #5 among all apps?"
Australia's central bank cuts interest rate for third time this year to 3.6%,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/australias-central-bank-cuts-interest-rate-for-third-time-this-year-to-36-2025-08-12/,"MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Australia’s central bank on Tuesday reduced its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point for a third time this year to 3.6%, with inflation tamed and economic growth stalling. The Reserve Bank of Australia reduced its cash rate from 3.85%. The rate was cut from 4.1% in May. The reduction from 4.35% at its February board meeting was Australia’s first rate cut since October 2020. The new rate is the lowest since March 2023 and the cut was widely anticipated as inflation continues to fall. The bank's governor, Michele Bullock, said international trade policy developments were expected to have an adverse effect on global economic activity. ""Uncertainty in the world economy remains elevated. There is a little more clarity on the scope and scale of U.S. tariffs and policy responses in other countries, suggesting that more extreme outcomes are likely to be avoided,"" Bullock said in a statement. The bank adjusts interest rates to steer inflation toward a target band of between 2% and 3%. In May, annual inflation fell to 2.1% from 2.4% a month earlier. The trimmed mean — a gauge of underlying inflation that is the bank’s preferred measure — fell from 2.8% in April to 2.4%. Inflation has gradually declined since it peaked at 7.8% in the last quarter of 2022. The bank was widely expected to cut the rate at its last board meeting in July. But directors voted 6-to-3 to wait to see inflation data for the June quarter. That data revealed that trimmed mean inflation was 2.7% in the three months through June, down from 2.9% in the March quarter. The board's decision to cut interest rates on Tuesday was unanimous. Treasurer Jim Chalmers said curbing inflation to within the target range had given the central bank confidence to cut interest rates three times in six months. “This is very welcome relief for millions of Australians,” Chalmers told reporters. “It will put more money in the pockets of people who are under pressure.” The economic boost of a rate cut comes after growth slowed to a sluggish 0.2% in the three months through March and 1.3% for the year. The economy grew 0.6% in the preceding December quarter. The bank has attempted to gradually rein in inflation without tipping the economy into recession or causing large-scale job losses. Unemployment rose to 4.3% in June from 4.1% where it had held steady since February. The jobless rate was at 4.0% in January.",The reduction from 4.35% at its February board meeting was Australia’s first rate cut since October 2020.,“It will put more money in the pockets of people who are under pressure.” The economic boost of a rate cut comes after growth slowed to a sluggish 0.2% in the three months through March and 1.3% for the year.,"The bank's governor, Michele Bullock, said international trade policy developments were expected to have an adverse effect on global economic activity.",“It will put more money in the pockets of people who are under pressure.” The economic boost of a rate cut comes after growth slowed to a sluggish 0.2% in the three months through March and 1.3% for the year.

Asian shares advance on relief that Trump is delaying higher China tariffs,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/asian-shares-advance-on-relief-that-trump-is-delaying-higher-china-tariffs-2025-08-11/,"TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares mostly advanced Tuesday after President Donald Trump delayed raising tariffs on China for another 90 days. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 jumped 2.6% to 42,942.14, topping its past all-time record. Toyota Motor Corp.'s shares surged 3.3% and other heavyweight shares also saw big gains. Hong Kong's Hang Seng slipped nearly 0.2% to 24,865.07, while the Shanghai Composite edged up 0.3% to 3,658.62. Trump signed an executive order Monday putting on hold a possible showdown between the world’s two major economies to allow time for more talks on a broad trade agreement. Without an extension, taxes on Chinese imports might have jumped from an already high 30%. Beijing could have responded by raising retaliatory levies on U.S. exports to China but it issued a similar statement about the extension of the tariff pause. The reprieve makes room for a possible deal with Trump, but it also prolongs the uncertainty that has bedeviled companies since the president began escalating his trade war. “The extension isn’t about goodwill; it’s about keeping oxygen in the room for deals that matter,” Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. Elsewhere in Asia, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 was little changed, rising less than 0.1% to 8,852.80. South Korea’s Kospi added 0.6% to 3,227.10. On Monday, U.S. stocks edged back from their record highs ahead of an update on U.S. inflation. The S&P 500 dipped 0.3% to 6,373.45 after flirting with its all-time high, which was set two weeks ago. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.5% to 43,975.09, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.3% to 21,385.40. The highlight of this week for Wall Street will likely arrive on Tuesday, when the government will report how bad inflation was across the country in July. Economists expect it to show U.S. consumers had to pay prices for groceries, gasoline and other costs of living that were 2.8% higher than a year earlier, a slight acceleration from June’s 2.7% inflation. Inflation has remained above 2%, even if it has improved substantially from its peak above 9% three years ago. And the worry is that President Donald Trump’s tariffs could push prices still higher. That in turn is raising fears about a potential, worst-case scenario called “stagflation” where the economy stagnates but inflation remains high. The Federal Reserve has no good tool to fix both at once, and it would need to concentrate on either the job market or inflation first. But helping one of those areas by moving interest rates would likely hurt the other. A top Fed official, Michelle Bowman, said on Saturday that she believes the job market is the bigger concern. She is still backing three cuts to interest rates by the Fed this year following this month’s stunning, weaker-than-expected report on the U.S. job market. Trump has also been angrily calling for cuts to interest rates to support the economy. Other Fed officials, led by Chair Jerome Powell, have been more hesitant. Powell has said he wants to wait for more data about how Trump’s tariffs are affecting inflation before the Fed makes its next move, and Tuesday’s update on the consumer price index may offer a big clue about that. The price of gold eased after Trump said he would not place tariffs on the metal. That followed a brouhaha Friday in the gold market after the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol seemed to rule that some kinds of gold bars coming from Switzerland would face a tariff. That caused a disconnect between the prices of gold trading in New York versus in London, but the market has since calmed. Gold for December delivery settled at $3,404.70 per ounce in New York, down 2.5%. Early Tuesday, it was down 0.1% at $3,399.70. In other dealings early Tuesday, benchmark U.S. crude rose 17 cents to $64.13 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, added 21 cents to $66.84 a barrel. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar edged up to 148.44 Japanese yen from 148.15 yen. The euro cost $1.1621, up from $1.1618. ___ AP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed.

"An explosion at a plant owned by US Steel, an icon of American industry, has killed 2. What to know",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/an-explosion-at-a-plant-owned-by-us-steel-an-icon-of-american-industry-has-killed-2-what-to-know-2025-08-11/,"An explosion at a U.S. Steel plant south of Pittsburgh killed two people and injured 10 others. The CEO has vowed to find out what caused Monday's blast while union officials say representatives will work to ensure a thorough investigation. The plant, Clairton Coke Works, is one of four major plants in Pennsylvania owned by U.S. Steel, an icon of the domestic steel industry and American industrialization for over a century. The plant is in the Mon Valley, a region of the state synonymous with steel. Here's what to know about the explosion: Allegheny County Emergency Services said a fire at the plant started around 10:50 a.m. The explosion, which was followed by several smaller blasts, sent black smoke spiraling into air. The blast could be felt in the nearby community and prompted county officials to warn residents to stay away from the scene so emergency workers could respond. One worker was rescued from the smoldering rubble hours later. Allegheny Health Network said it treated seven patients from the plant and discharged five within a few hours. The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center said it was treating three patients at UPMC Mercy, the region’s only level one trauma and burn center. The plant converts coal to coke, a key component in the steel-making process. It’s the largest coking operation in North America. Coke is made by baking coal in special ovens for hours at high temperatures, which removes impurities that could otherwise weaken steel. The process creates what’s known as coke gas — made up of a lethal mix of methane, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. Clairton Coke Works, which has 1,400 workers, has had explosions and fatal accidents before: 1. In September 2009, a maintenance worker was killed in an explosion 2. In July 2010, an explosion injured 14 employees and six contractors. Afterward, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined U.S. Steel and a subcontractor $175,000 for safety violations. U.S. Steel appealed its citations and $143,500 in fines, which were later reduced under a settlement agreement. 3. The last death at the plant was in 2014, according to online OSHA records of workplace fatalities. A worker was burned and died after falling into a trench. 4. In February, a problem with a battery at the plant led to a “buildup of combustible material” that ignited, causing an audible “boom,” officials said. Two workers received first aid treatment but were not seriously injured. After Monday's blast, the county health department initially told residents within 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) of the plant to remain indoors and close all windows and doors. The department lifted the advisory after its monitors didn’t detect levels of soot or sulfur dioxide above federal standards. In 2018, a Christmas Eve fire damaged pollution control equipment and led to repeated releases of sulfur dioxide, according to a subsequent lawsuit. The fire prompted Allegheny County to warn residents to limit outdoor activities. Residents said it was hard to breathe for weeks afterward and that the air felt acidic and smelled like rotten eggs. U.S. Steel settled the lawsuit last year with an agreement to spend $19.5 million in equipment upgrades and $5 million on local clean air efforts and programs. Dr. Deborah Gentile, the medical director of Community Partners in Asthma Care, studied asthma levels after the fire and found twice as many patients sought medical treatment. One of her colleagues found patients living near the plant had increased symptoms of asthma, including coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath. In 2019, U.S. Steel agreed to settle a lawsuit regarding air pollution from Clairton for $8.5 million. U.S. Steel has been a symbol of industrialization since it was founded in 1901 by J.P. Morgan, Andrew Carnegie and others. It's been the icon of the American steel industry that once dominated the world market until Japan, then China, became preeminent steelmakers over the past 40 years. Its steel has helped build everything from the United Nations building in New York City to the New Orleans Superdome. Japan's largest steelmaker, Nippon Steel, in June finalized a deal to acquire U.S. Steel for nearly $15 billion. The agreement took more than a year to come together after U.S. Steel shareholders approved it as the parties surmounted obstacles created by national security concerns and presidential politics in a premier battleground state. The deal includes what is known as a “golden share” provision that gives the U.S. government the power to appoint a board member and a say in company decisions that affect domestic steel production and competition with overseas producers. The combined company is the world’s fourth-largest steelmaker in an industry now dominated by China.

Officials are still investigating the cause of a Pennsylvania steel plant explosion that killed 2,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/officials-are-still-investigating-the-cause-of-a-pennsylvania-steel-plant-explosion-that-killed-2-2025-08-11/,"CLAIRTON, Pa. (AP) — An explosion rocked a steel plant outside Pittsburgh on Monday, leaving two dead and 10 others injured, including a person who was rescued from the smoldering rubble after hours of being trapped. The explosion sent black smoke spiraling into the midday sky in the Mon Valley, a region of the state synonymous with steel for more than a century. Allegheny County Emergency Services said a fire at the plant in Clairton started late Monday morning. Officials said they had not isolated the cause of the blast. The rumbling from the explosion, and several smaller blasts that followed, jolted the community about 15 miles (24 kilometers) southeast of Pittsburgh. “It felt like thunder,” Zachary Buday, a construction worker near the scene, told WTAE-TV. “Shook the scaffold, shook my chest, and shook the building."" At a news conference, Scott Buckiso, U.S. Steel’s chief manufacturing officer, did not give details about the damage or casualties, and said they were still trying to determine what happened. He said the company, now a subsidiary of Japan-based Nippon Steel Corp., is working with authorities. Allegheny Health Network said it treated seven patients from the plant and discharged five within a few hours. University of Pittsburgh Medical Center said it is treating three patients at UPMC Mercy, the region’s only level one trauma and burn center. According to the company, the plant has approximately 1,400 workers. In a statement, the United Steelworkers, which represents many of the Clairton plant’s workers, said it had representatives on the ground at the plant and would work to ensure there is a thorough investigation. David Masur, executive director of PennEnvironment, an environmental group that has sued U.S. Steel over pollution, said there needed to be “a full, independent investigation into the causes of this latest catastrophe and a re-evaluation as to whether the Clairton plant is fit to keep operating.” U.S. Steel CEO David B. Burritt said the company would investigate. It's not the first explosion at the plant. A maintenance worker was killed in a blast in September 2009. In July 2010, another explosion injured 14 employees and six contractors. According to online OSHA records of workplace fatalities, the last death at the plant was in 2014, when a worker was burned and died after falling into a trench. After the 2010 explosion, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined U.S. Steel and a subcontractor $175,000 for safety violations. U.S. Steel appealed its citations and fines, which were later reduced under a settlement agreement. In February, a problem with a battery at the plant led to a “buildup of combustible material” that ignited, causing an audible “boom,” officials said. Two workers received first aid treatment but were not seriously injured. The plant, a massive industrial facility along the Monongahela River, is considered the largest coking operation in North America and is one of four major U.S. Steel plants in Pennsylvania. The plant converts coal to coke, a key component in the steel-making process. To make coke, coal is baked in special ovens for hours at high temperatures to remove impurities that could otherwise weaken steel. The process creates what’s known as coke gas — made up of a lethal mix of methane, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. The county health department initially told residents within 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) of the plant to remain indoors and close all windows and doors, but lifted the advisory later Monday. It said its monitors didn't detect levels of soot or sulfur dioxide above federal standards. In June, U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel announced they had finalized a “historic partnership,” a deal that gives the U.S. government a say in some matters and comes a year and a half after the Japanese company first proposed its nearly $15 billion buyout of the iconic American steelmaker. The pursuit by Nippon Steel for the Pittsburgh-based company was buffeted by national security concerns and presidential politics in a premier battleground state, dragging out the transaction for more than a year after U.S. Steel shareholders approved it. ___ Levy reported from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; Casey reported from Boston and Whittle reported from Portland, Maine.

Bolivia's election may spell the end of its long-ruling left. Here's what to know,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/bolivias-election-may-spell-the-end-of-its-long-ruling-left-heres-what-to-know-2025-08-11/,"LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) — For most of Renan Aliaga’s adult life, a single name dominated the politics of Bolivia: Evo Morales. Morales, a former union leader for coca farmers, founded the Andean nation's most successful political party and transformed Bolivia over three consecutive terms marked by political stability and economic growth. But when Aliaga goes to the polls on Sunday to vote for Bolivia's next president, he won’t see Morales' name on the ballot after electoral authorities excluded him. In fact, for the first time in two decades, Aliaga won’t see any big name from the governing Movement Toward Socialism, or MAS, party that Morales founded — not even President Luis Arce, Morales' protege-turned-rival, who withdrew from the race over his failure to halt an economic tailspin. Under MAS, Bolivia enjoyed years of a fixed exchange rate, low inflation and subsidized energy. Now, high inflation, a scarcity of imported goods and fuel shortages have beset the country. Arce handed the reins to a little-known minister, Eduardo Del Castillo. The main options remaining include a conservative businessman and right-wing former president — both of whom have run and lost three times before — and a young leftist Senate leader. Unsatisfied, Aliaga, a 39-year-old bus driver and former MAS voter, says he'll make a last-minute decision. “The right wing had its chance, and it was a disaster,” he said, recalling the hardship of the 1990s, when Bolivia became a poster child for free-market economics and the two right-wing front-runners — businessman Samuel Doria Medina and ex-President Jorge “Tuto” Quiroga — built their careers. “But the left wing has proven to be the same, or worse,” Aliaga said, referring to how the MAS strategy of nationalizing resources and redistributing tax receipts sputtered out with the end of the commodities boom. The main issues in this hotly contested election are Bolivia's long-standing leftist economic model, its democratic integrity and the livelihoods of millions of people undergoing the country's worst financial crisis in four decades. “This seems the end of the cycle not only for MAS, but for an entire model of government,” Bolivia political analyst Verónica Rocha said. Tensions within MAS can be traced to Morales' disputed 2019 reelection. Protests erupted and the leftist leader resigned under pressure from the military. He fled into exile and right-wing Senator Jeanine Áñez took office in what many view as a coup. Violent clashes between protesters and security forces killed at least 37 people. Morales returned to Bolivia following the 2020 election victory of his former finance minister, Arce. But their competing ambitions collided when Morales announced his intention to return to politics. Lawmakers loyal to Morales deprived Arce’s government of its majority. Judges answering to Arce ordered Morales’ arrest over his sexual relationship with a 15-year-old girl and barred his 2025 presidential candidacy on account of his past terms. “MAS torpedoed its own chances of winning this election,” said Gustavo Flores-Macías, a professor of government and public policy at Cornell University. A young vice president, Quiroga became interim leader in 2001 when then President Hugo Banzer, Bolivia’s former military dictator, resigned because of terminal cancer with a year left in his term. Ever since, Quiroga has yearned for a term of his own. He ran three times — twice against Morales in 2005 and 2014. Now 65, he’s hoping the fourth time’s the charm. Doria Medina, 66, a former minister of planning from 1991-1993 made his fortune in cement and owns Bolivia's Burger King franchise. Dubbed the “eternal candidate,” he lost to Morales in 2005, 2009 and 2014, as Bolivia’s natural gas windfall, underwritten by public investment and generous subsidies, buoyed the union leader's popularity. When commodity prices slumped and gas production plummeted, Morales’ “economic miracle” went bust. Now once-routine errands have turned into nightmares as Bolivians wait in fuel lines that wrap around city blocks, run from pharmacy to pharmacy in search of medicines and queue for subsidized bread that has shrunk to almost half its normal size. This may give the opposition its first real shot at power in two decades. Yet Bolivians interviewed across the administrative capital of La Paz expressed not only frustration with the MAS party, but also disappointment in the right-wing establishment. “If people vote for the right, it's because they're resigned to it as the only alternative,” said Bolivian author Quya Reyna. “These are recycled politicians from the 1990s era of privatization."" Doria Medina and Quiroga vow to slash fuel subsidies, dismantle inefficient state-owned companies, let foreign investors mine Bolivia’s abundant lithium reserves and reorient the nation's foreign policy toward the United States after years of its alignment with China and Russia. Graffiti sprayed across La Paz reads “100 days, dammit"" — Doria Medina's pledge to fix fuel shortages and stabilize the exchange rate within his first 100 days. Motorists waiting for hours to get gas find themselves facing billboards of Quiroga promising “No more lines!” If no candidate wins a majority of the vote, a runoff between the top two finishers will be held on Oct. 19. Voter cynicism is widespread, with many Bolivians saying that they have no faith in any of the candidates to improve their lives. Longtime MAS voters wary of austerity under a right-wing president aren't sure where to turn. Some initially pinned their hopes on 36-year-old Senate President Andrónico Rodríguez, a coca-farming union activist who could have appealed to Indigenous communities looking for the kind of representation they found under Morales. But Morales branded Rodríguez a traitor for advancing his own candidacy. The Senate leader has made few public appearances since. A rare centrist candidate, lawmaker Rodrigo Paz and his media-savvy running mate, ex-Police Captain Edman Lara, have recently energized young voters with TikTok videos from the campaign trail. With Doria Medina and Quiroga neck and neck, Paz could play kingmaker. But their Christian Democratic Party's blistering attacks on both MAS and the right-wing have left some voters without a clear sense of where they stand. “We've all been raised on politicians' broken promises,” said Irma Marín, 38, shouting to be heard over the crowd at a Paz-Lara campaign rally Sunday. “I'm not sure who to trust.” Facing an arrest warrant, Morales, 66, has been holed up for months in his tropical stronghold of Chapare. His followers staged raucous protests against his removal from the race, blocking key roads and confronting police in clashes in June that killed four officers and four civilians. Morales is urging voters to register their rage by casting null-and-void ballots. “Null votes signal that these elections are not legitimate and the next government of Bolivia won't be legitimate,” said Chris Velasco, an organizer close to Morales. “That will mean political instability, social instability.”","“This seems the end of the cycle not only for MAS, but for an entire model of government,” Bolivia political analyst Verónica Rocha said.","In fact, for the first time in two decades, Aliaga won’t see any big name from the governing Movement Toward Socialism, or MAS, party that Morales founded — not even President Luis Arce, Morales' protege-turned-rival, who withdrew from the race over his failure to halt an economic tailspin.","Some initially pinned their hopes on 36-year-old Senate President Andrónico Rodríguez, a coca-farming union activist who could have appealed to Indigenous communities looking for the kind of representation they found under Morales.","“The right wing had its chance, and it was a disaster,” he said, recalling the hardship of the 1990s, when Bolivia became a poster child for free-market economics and the two right-wing front-runners — businessman Samuel Doria Medina and ex-President Jorge “Tuto” Quiroga — built their careers."
Cambodian migrant workers face an uncertain future as Thai border conflict drives them home,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/cambodian-migrant-workers-face-an-uncertain-future-as-thai-border-conflict-drives-them-home-2025-08-11/,"KAMRIENG, Cambodia (AP) — Hundreds of thousands of Cambodian migrant workers have been heading home from Thailand as the two countries work to keep a ceasefire in armed clashes along their border. Tensions between the countries have escalated due to disputes over pockets of land along their 800-kilometer (500-mile) border. A five-day clash in July left at least 43 people dead and displaced more than 260,000 in both Southeast Asian nations. A fragile ceasefire brokered by Malaysia, with backing from the U.S. and China, appears to be holding while officials try to resolve issues underlying the conflict. The retreat has left many of the workers streaming back to Cambodia wondering how to get by after they left jobs that enabled them to send money back to their families. Kri Phart, a 56-year-old poultry worker, said he began packing after reading a post by Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet on Facebook urging migrants to return to Cambodia. “I have no idea if the fighting will really stop and with fewer and fewer Cambodians in Thailand, I got nervous,” said Kri Phart, seated on a stoop with two big bags of belongings and a big electric fan. “I didn’t want to be the last Cambodian migrant in Thailand.” “I got scared because of the border conflict,” said Kri Phart, one of thousands of Cambodians streaming shoulder-to-shoulder through the Daung International Border Gate last week, hauling rainbow colored bags, appliances and even guitars in the 40 Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) heat. “Many of the Cambodians I knew working in Thailand ran away. Everyday more and more of us fled,” he said. The reasons driving Cambodians to flee Thailand are varied. Human rights activists reported that some migrant workers had been attacked by gangs of young Thais. Others were alarmed by unsubstantiated rumors that the Cambodian government would seize their land and revoke their citizenships if they didn’t return home by mid-August. Cambodia’s Ministry of Labor and Vocational Training estimates 1.2 million Cambodians were working in Thailand when the border disputes began to escalate in June. Estimates vary, but Sun Mesa, a ministry spokesman said at least 780,000 — about 65% — have returned to Cambodia. He said the workers could find jobs with equal pay and benefits back home. Many of those who were driven by poverty or climate change to leave for work in Thailand expressed doubts. “Now that I am back, there is going to be no income for a while and this will really put my family in a bad situation,” said Thouk Houy, 26, who left a job at a leather factory south of Bangkok that enabled her to send $70 to $100 a month back to her parents. “I'm the last of my siblings who is still single, meaning it's my responsibility to support my parents. I don’t know how I can do that now that I am back home,"" she said. Minor spats between Cambodian and Thai workers at the factory and her mother's nightly pleas for her to go home were factors behind her decision to leave, she said. Handing over her belongings to be strapped into the back of a precariously packed van, Thouk Houy said the clincher was a claim by influential former Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, father of the current prime minister, Hun Manet, that Thailand was preparing to invade. “Now that I'm home, what will I do to make a living?” she said. Migrant workers fill vital roles in Thailand's farming, construction and manufacturing industries. They also send home close to $3 billion in remittances each year, according to labor ministry data. The loss of that income can be devastating for families relying on it to manage big debts, said Nathan Green, an assistant professor of geography at the National University of Singapore. “These kinds of conflicts demonstrate how precarious migrant livelihoods are in Cambodia,” Green said. An overseas advocacy group, the Khmer Movement for Democracy, has urged the government to defer loan payments and provide incentives for companies to hire returning migrants. “Without economic safeguards, families of returning migrants will not be able to repay their debts and financial institutions will be at their throats,” said Mu Sochua, the group's president. “We are talking about the poorest of the poor, who will be deprived of incomes.” Meng Yeam, who was trying to wave down a taxi while keeping an eye on his belongings, said he managed to send his family back home 20,000 baht (roughly $600) while working as a manager at a rubber factory in eastern Thailand’s Chonburi Province. More than 90% of the Cambodians working in the factory have left, the 32-year-old said. Meng Yeam said he expected his family to be okay, though it won’t be able to save as much as it did while he was working in Thailand. And he was glum about the prospects for things to return to normal. “Cambodia and Thailand need each other to do well, but for now, it seems like we just cannot get along,” Meng Yeam said. “I hope we can work in Thailand again one day, but who knows, maybe I will be retired by the time we stop fighting.” ___ Sopheng Cheang reported from Phnom Penh, Cambodia.","“Now that I am back, there is going to be no income for a while and this will really put my family in a bad situation,” said Thouk Houy, 26, who left a job at a leather factory south of Bangkok that enabled her to send $70 to $100 a month back to her parents.","“Now that I am back, there is going to be no income for a while and this will really put my family in a bad situation,” said Thouk Houy, 26, who left a job at a leather factory south of Bangkok that enabled her to send $70 to $100 a month back to her parents.","“Cambodia and Thailand need each other to do well, but for now, it seems like we just cannot get along,” Meng Yeam said.","“Now that I am back, there is going to be no income for a while and this will really put my family in a bad situation,” said Thouk Houy, 26, who left a job at a leather factory south of Bangkok that enabled her to send $70 to $100 a month back to her parents."
South Korean President Lee will travel to Washington for Aug. 25 meeting with Trump,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/south-korean-president-lee-will-travel-to-washington-for-aug-25-meeting-with-trump-2025-08-11/,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s new President Lee Jae Myung will travel to Washington later this month to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump, Lee’s office said Tuesday, for talks on trade and defense cooperation in the face of nuclear-armed North Korea and other threats. Their Aug. 25 summit will follow a July trade deal in which Washington agreed to cut its reciprocal tariff on South Korea to 15% from the initially proposed 25% and to apply the same reduced rate to South Korean cars, the country’s top export to the United States. South Korea also agreed to purchase $100 billion in U.S. energy and invest $350 billion in the country, and Lee and Trump may discuss how the investment package will be structured and managed. The talks are expected to cover expanding cooperation in key industries such as semiconductors, batteries and shipbuilding, Lee’s spokesperson Kang Yu-jung said. Lee, a liberal who won an early election in June to replace ousted conservative Yoon Suk Yeol, has made the economy his top priority, aiming to shield the trade-dependent nation from the shocks of Trump’s tariff hikes and his demands that allies cut reliance on Washington and shoulder more of their own defense costs. Lee's meeting with Trump comes amid concerns in Seoul that the Trump administration could shake up the decades-old alliance by demanding higher payments for the U.S. troop presence in South Korea and possibly move to reduce it as Washington shifts more focus on China. Lee and Trump will discuss strengthening the allies’ defense posture against growing North Korean threats, and also developing the partnership into a “future-oriented, comprehensive strategic alliance” to address the changing international security and economic environment, according to Kang, who didn’t elaborate on the specific issues to be addressed. Dating back to his first term, Trump has regularly called for South Korea to pay more for the 28,500 American troops stationed on its soil. Recent comments by key Trump administration officials, including Undersecretary of Defense Elbridge Colby, have also suggested a desire to restructure the alliance, which some experts say could potentially affect the size and role of U.S. forces in South Korea. Under this approach, South Korea would take a greater role in countering North Korean threats while U.S. forces focus more on China, possibly leaving Seoul to face reduced benefits but increased costs and risks, experts say. In a meeting with South Korean reporters last week, Gen. Xavier Brunson, commander of U.S. Forces Korea, stressed the need to “modernize” the alliance to address the evolving security environment, including North Korea’s expanding nuclear program, its deepening alignment with Russia, and what he called Chinese threats to a “free and open Indo-Pacific.” When asked about a potential reduction in U.S. troops in South Korea, Brunson emphasized capabilities over numbers, highlighting advanced systems like fifth-generation fighters, and also stressed strategic flexibility, citing the recent deployment of Patriot air defense systems from South Korea to the Middle East. “What’s being asked of Korea is to be stronger against DPRK — that we might have the flexibility as we modernize our alliance so that we could go do other things,” Brunson said, using the initials of North Korea’s formal name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. During his first term, Trump suspended U.S. military exercises with South Korea while pursuing diplomacy with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. They met three times in 2018 and 2019 but their diplomacy quickly collapsed over disagreements about exchanging the release of U.S.-led sanctions against the North and the North’s steps to wind down its nuclear and missile program. Kim has since suspended virtually all diplomacy with Washington and Seoul while accelerating the expansion of his weapons program. His foreign policy priority is now Russia, which he has supplied with weapons and troops to help prolong Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Kim’s powerful sister recently dismissed Washington and Seoul’s stated desires to restart diplomacy aimed at defusing the North’s nuclear program, indicating that Pyongyang feels no urgency to resume diplomacy with South Korea and the U.S. anytime soon. Tensions on the peninsula could rise again later this month, when South Korea and the United States proceed with their annual large-scale combined military exercises, which begin on Aug. 18. North Korea labels the allies’ joint drills as invasion rehearsals and often uses them as a pretext to dial up military demonstrations and weapons tests aimed at advancing its nuclear program.","Forces Korea, stressed the need to “modernize” the alliance to address the evolving security environment, including North Korea’s expanding nuclear program, its deepening alignment with Russia, and what he called Chinese threats to a “free and open Indo-Pacific.” When asked about a potential reduction in U.S. troops in South Korea, Brunson emphasized capabilities over numbers, highlighting advanced systems like fifth-generation fighters, and also stressed strategic flexibility, citing the recent deployment of Patriot air defense systems from South Korea to the Middle East.","Forces Korea, stressed the need to “modernize” the alliance to address the evolving security environment, including North Korea’s expanding nuclear program, its deepening alignment with Russia, and what he called Chinese threats to a “free and open Indo-Pacific.” When asked about a potential reduction in U.S. troops in South Korea, Brunson emphasized capabilities over numbers, highlighting advanced systems like fifth-generation fighters, and also stressed strategic flexibility, citing the recent deployment of Patriot air defense systems from South Korea to the Middle East.","Under this approach, South Korea would take a greater role in countering North Korean threats while U.S. forces focus more on China, possibly leaving Seoul to face reduced benefits but increased costs and risks, experts say.","Forces Korea, stressed the need to “modernize” the alliance to address the evolving security environment, including North Korea’s expanding nuclear program, its deepening alignment with Russia, and what he called Chinese threats to a “free and open Indo-Pacific.” When asked about a potential reduction in U.S. troops in South Korea, Brunson emphasized capabilities over numbers, highlighting advanced systems like fifth-generation fighters, and also stressed strategic flexibility, citing the recent deployment of Patriot air defense systems from South Korea to the Middle East."
Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani and agent accused of sabotaging $240M Hawaii real estate project,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/dodgers-star-shohei-ohtani-and-agent-accused-of-sabotaging-240m-hawaii-real-estate-project-2025-08-11/,"A Hawaii real estate investor and broker are suing Shohei Ohtani, claiming the Los Angeles Dodgers star and his agent got them fired from a $240 million luxury housing development on the Big Island’s coveted Hapuna Coast that they brought him in to endorse. According to the lawsuit filed in Hawaii Circuit Court on Friday, Ohtani’s agent, Nez Balelo, increasingly demanded concessions from developer Kevin J. Hayes Sr. and real estate broker Tomoko Matsumoto before demanding that their business partner, Kingsbarn Realty Capital, drop them from the deal. “Balelo and Otani, who were brought into the venture solely for Otani’s promotional and branding value, exploited their celebrity leverage to destabilize and ultimately dismantle Plaintiffs’ role in the project — for no reason other than their own financial self-interest,” the lawsuit claims. The suit accuses Ohtani and Balelo of tortious interference and unjust enrichment. Hayes, a developer with 40 years of experience, and Matsumoto, who was to be the listing agent for the houses averaging $17.3 million each, say that Ohtani and Balelo also tried to undermine their interests in a second, neighboring venture. A spokesman for Balelo's agency, CAA Baseball, declined comment. Attempts to reach Kingsbarn officials for comment were not immediately successful. “This case is about abuse of power,” the lawsuit says. “Defendants used threats and baseless legal claims to force a business partner to betray its contractual obligations and strip Plaintiffs of the very project they conceived and built. “Defendants must be held accountable for their actions, not shielded by fame or behind-the-scenes agents acting with impunity. Plaintiffs bring this suit to expose Defendants’ misconduct and to ensure that the rules of contract, fair dealing, and accountability apply equally to all — celebrity or not.” Ohtani, 31, arrived from Japan in 2018 as perhaps the most heralded international star in baseball history, with an ability to both pitch and hit that made him doubly valuable to his team. A five-time All-Star and three-time Most Valuable Player, he signed a record 10-year, $700-million contract with the Dodgers before last season and helped the team win the 2024 World Series. Investment materials for The Vista at Mauna Kea Resort, which remained online on Monday night, listed Hayes and Matsumoto as part of the management team, along with Kingsbarn. It called Ohtani “Japan's Babe Ruth” and the “1st Resident,” giving him top billing ahead of the iconic Mauna Kea Resort, “one of the most celebrated hotels in Hawaii,” Hapuna Beach, “rated the #1 beach in America by Conde Nast Traveler” and two golf courses – one designed by Arnold Palmer, the other by Robert Trent Jones Sr. “Ohtani will act as the celebrity spokesperson for the project and has committed to purchasing one of the 14 residences within the project,” the brochure says. “He also intends to spend significant time at The Vista in the off-season and will construct a small hitting and pitching facility for preseason training."" The suit says the developers spent 11 years working on the deal and “as part of a bold marketing strategy” signed an endorsement deal in 2023 with Ohtani, “one of the most high-profile endorsements imaginable."" “This partnership with Ohtani will elevate the demand and create buzz within the Japanese luxury vacation home market, which is a primary target audience for the project,"" the investment brochure said. “We see Shohei Ohtani’s homeownership as having a significant impact on the global exposure of the project and expect to accelerate the pace of sales, thereby helping us achieve our pricing objectives.” The suit said Balelo “quickly became a disruptive force,” threatening to pull Ohtani from the deal if concessions weren't made. “Kingsbarn began capitulating to Balelo’s every whim,” the suit said. “Over time, it became increasingly obvious that Kingsbarn was more concerned about preserving its relationship with Otani than honoring its obligations to its business partners.” Last month, in what the suit called “a coordinated ambush,” Kingsbarn fired Hayes and Matsumoto. “Kingsbarn openly admitted during the call that Balelo had demanded the terminations and that they were being done solely to placate him,” the suit said. “Plaintiffs stand to lose millions of dollars in compensation tied to projected homebuilding profit, construction management fees, and broker commissions.” ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb","According to the lawsuit filed in Hawaii Circuit Court on Friday, Ohtani’s agent, Nez Balelo, increasingly demanded concessions from developer Kevin J.

"US and China extend trade truce another 90 days, easing tension between world's largest economies",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/us-and-china-extend-trade-truce-another-90-days-easing-tension-between-worlds-largest-economies-2025-08-11/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump extended a trade truce with China for another 90 days Monday, at least delaying once again a dangerous showdown between the world’s two biggest economies. Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that he signed the executive order for the extension, and that “all other elements of the Agreement will remain the same.” Beijing at the same time also announced the extension of the tariff pause, according to the Ministry of Commerce. The previous deadline was set to expire at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday. Had that happened the U.S. could have ratcheted up taxes on Chinese imports from an already high 30%, and Beijing could have responded by raising retaliatory levies on U.S. exports to China. The pause buys time for the two countries to work out some of their differences, perhaps clearing the way for a summit later this year between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, and it has been welcomed by the U.S. companies doing business with China. Sean Stein, president of the U.S.-China Business Council, said the extension is “critical” to give the two governments time to negotiate a trade agreement that U.S. businesses hope would improve their market access in China and provide the certainty needed for companies to make medium- and long-term plans. “Securing an agreement on fentanyl that leads to a reduction in U.S. tariffs and a rollback of China’s retaliatory measures is acutely needed to restart U.S. agriculture and energy exports,” Stein said. China said Tuesday it would extend relief to American companies who were placed on an export control list and an unreliable entities list. After Trump initially announced tariffs in April, China restricted exports of dual-use goods to some American companies, while banning others from trading or investing in China. The Ministry of Commerce said it would stop those restrictions for some companies, while giving others another 90-day extension. Reaching a pact with China remains unfinished business for Trump, who has already upended the global trading system by slapping double-digit taxes – tariffs – on almost every country on earth. The European Union, Japan and other trading partners agreed to lopsided trade deals with Trump, accepting once unthinkably U.S. high tariffs (15% on Japanese and EU imports, for instance) to ward off something worse. Trump’s trade policies have turned the United States from one of the most open economies in the world into a protectionist fortress. The average U.S. tariff has gone from around 2.5% at the start of the year to 18.6%, highest since 1933, according to the Budget Lab at Yale University. But China tested the limits of a U.S. trade policy built around using tariffs as a cudgel to beat concessions out of trading partners. Beijing had a cudgel of its own: cutting off or slowing access to its rare earths minerals and magnets – used in everything from electric vehicles to jet engines. In June, the two countries reached an agreement to ease tensions. The United States said it would pull back export restrictions on computer chip technology and ethane, a feedstock in petrochemical production. And China agreed to make it easier for U.S. firms to get access to rare earths. “The U.S. has realized it does not have the upper hand,’’ said Claire Reade, senior counsel at Arnold & Porter and former assistant U.S. trade representative for China affairs. In May, the U.S. and China had averted an economic catastrophe by reducing massive tariffs they'd slapped on each other’s products, which had reached as high as 145% against China and 125% against the U.S. Those triple-digit tariffs threatened to effectively end trade between the United States and China and caused a frightening sell-off in financial markets. In a May meeting in Geneva they agreed to back off and keep talking: America’s tariffs went back down to a still-high 30% and China’s to 10%. Having demonstrated their ability to hurt each other, they’ve been talking ever since. “By overestimating the ability of steep tariffs to induce economic concessions from China, the Trump administration has not only underscored the limits of unilateral U.S. leverage, but also given Beijing grounds for believing that it can indefinitely enjoy the upper hand in subsequent talks with Washington by threatening to curtail rare earth exports,'' said Ali Wyne, a specialist in U.S.-China relations at the International Crisis Group. ""The administration’s desire for a trade détente stems from the self-inflicted consequences of its earlier hubris.” It’s unclear whether Washington and Beijing can reach a grand bargain over America’s biggest grievances. Among these are lax Chinese protection of intellectual property rights and Beijing’s subsidies and other industrial policies that, the Americans say, give Chinese firms an unfair advantage in world markets and have contributed to a massive U.S. trade deficit with China of $262 billion last year. Reade doesn’t expect much beyond limited agreements such as the Chinese saying they will buy more American soybeans and promising to do more to stop the flow of chemicals used to make fentanyl and to allow the continued flow of rare-earth magnets. But the tougher issues will likely linger, and “the trade war will continue grinding ahead for years into the future,’’ said Jeff Moon, a former U.S. diplomat and trade official who now runs the China Moon Strategies consultancy. ___ Associated Press Staff Writers Josh Boak and Huizhong Wu contributed to this story.","Sean Stein, president of the U.S.-China Business Council, said the extension is “critical” to give the two governments time to negotiate a trade agreement that U.S. businesses hope would improve their market access in China and provide the certainty needed for companies to make medium- and long-term plans.","In May, the U.S. and China had averted an economic catastrophe by reducing massive tariffs they'd slapped on each other’s products, which had reached as high as 145% against China and 125% against the U.S. Those triple-digit tariffs threatened to effectively end trade between the United States and China and caused a frightening sell-off in financial markets.","The United States said it would pull back export restrictions on computer chip technology and ethane, a feedstock in petrochemical production.","Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that he signed the executive order for the extension, and that “all other elements of the Agreement will remain the same.” Beijing at the same time also announced the extension of the tariff pause, according to the Ministry of Commerce."

"Inflation likely moved higher last month as tariffs bite, putting the Fed in bind",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/inflation-likely-moved-higher-last-month-as-tariffs-bite-putting-the-fed-in-bind-2025-08-11/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Inflation likely ticked up in July for the third straight month as tariffs lift the cost of imported goods such as furniture, appliances, and toys, which could make it harder for the Federal Reserve to cut short-term interest rates as President Donald Trump has demanded. Consumer prices are forecast to have risen 2.8% in July from a year earlier, according to a survey of economists by data provider FactSet. That annual pace would be up from 2.7% in June and a post-pandemic low of 2.3% in April. Excluding volatile food and energy costs, core inflation is expected to rise to 3%, from 2.9% in June. Both figures are well above the Fed's 2% price target. The potential increases, while modest, would put the Fed in a difficult spot: Hiring slowed sharply in the spring, after Trump announced a sweeping set of tariffs in April. The stalling out of job gains has boosted financial market expectations for an interest rate cut by the central bank. Yet Fed chair Jerome Powell has warned that worsening inflation could keep the Fed on the sidelines — a stance that has enraged Trump, who has defied traditional norms of central bank independence and demanded lower borrowing costs. Tuesday's data will also arrive at a highly-charged moment for the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, which collects and publishes the inflation data. Trump fired Erika McEntarfer, then the head of BLS, after the Aug. 1 jobs report also showed sharply lower hiring for May and June than had previously been reported. The president posted on social media Monday that he has picked E.J. Antoni, an economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation and a frequent critic of the jobs report, to replace McEntarfer. “E.J. will ensure that the Numbers released are HONEST and ACCURATE,” Trump said on Truth Social. Adding to the BLS's turmoil is a government-wide hiring freeze that has forced it to cut back on the amount of data it collects for each inflation report, the agency has said. UBS economist Alan Detmeister estimates that BLS is now collecting about 18% fewer price quotes for the inflation report than it did a few months ago. He thinks the report will produce more volatile results, though averaged out over time, still reliable. On a monthly basis, prices are expected to rise modestly, increasing just 0.2% from June to July and core prices rising 0.3%. Gas prices likely fell in July and grocery costs are expected to barely increase, muting overall inflation. Signs of duties pushing up prices first emerged in the June inflation report released last month. Toy prices jumped 1.8% from May to June, after a 1.3% increase the previous month. Clothing prices rose 0.4% in June, while sporting goods leapt 1.8%. Meanwhile, the average tariff level has climbed from about 2% before Trump's inauguration to nearly 18%, the highest since the early 1930s, according to the Budget Lab at Yale. Most imports from the European Union and Japan now face duties of 15%, while goods from Taiwan pay 20% and Switzerland, 39%. Other trends are helping keep inflation from rising more quickly. Price increases for apartment rents, for example, are steadily cooling after sharp spikes during the pandemic era. And prices for new cars have declined slightly in recent months, even after Trump slapped 25% duties on autos and auto parts. So far, U.S. and overseas carmakers are paying the tariffs, though economists say they likely will pass them on to consumers soon. Car companies are also paying 50% import taxes on steel and aluminum and 30% on parts from China. Ford has said it paid $800 million in tariffs in the second quarter, while General Motors shouldered $1.1 billion. Stellantis, the world's fourth-largest carmaker and the maker of brands such as Chrysler, Dodge, and Jeep, has said it has paid $350 million in tariffs out of a $1.7 billion expected cost this year. Consumers are likely to absorb more costs beyond the auto industry in the coming months, as Trump has begun to finalize many tariffs. Once businesses know what they will be paying, they are more likely to pass those costs to consumers, economists say. Trump has insisted that overseas manufacturers will pay the tariffs by reducing their prices to offset the duties. Yet the pre-tariff prices of imports haven't fallen much since the levies were put in place. Economists at Goldman Sachs estimate that foreign manufacturers have absorbed just 14% of the duties through June, while 22% has been paid by consumers and 64% by U.S. companies. Based on previous patterns, however — such as Trump's 2018 duties on washing machines — the economists expect that by this fall consumers will bear 67% of the burden, while foreign exporters pay 25% and U.S. companies handle just 8%. Many large firms are still raising prices in response to the tariffs, including apparel makers Ralph Lauren and Under Armour, and eyewear company Warby Parker. Consumer products giant Procter & Gamble, maker of Crest toothpaste, Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper, said late last month that it would lift prices on about a quarter of its products by mid-single-digit percentages. And cosmetics maker e.l.f. Beauty, which makes a majority of its products in China, said on Wednesday that it had raised prices by a dollar on its entire product assortment as of Aug. 1 because of tariff costs, the third price hike in its 21-year history. “We tend to lead and then we will see how many more kind of follow us,” CEO Tarang Amin said on an earnings call Wednesday. Matt Pavich, CEO of Revionics, a company that provides AI tools to large retailers to help them evaluate pricing decisions, says many companies are raising prices selectively to offset tariffs, rather than across the board. “Up until now we haven't seen a massive hit to consumers in retail prices,” Pavich said. “Now, they are going up, we've seen that.” ____ Associated Press Retail Writer Anne D'Innocenzio in New York contributed to this report.","Adding to the BLS's turmoil is a government-wide hiring freeze that has forced it to cut back on the amount of data it collects for each inflation report, the agency has said.","WASHINGTON (AP) — Inflation likely ticked up in July for the third straight month as tariffs lift the cost of imported goods such as furniture, appliances, and toys, which could make it harder for the Federal Reserve to cut short-term interest rates as President Donald Trump has demanded.",UBS economist Alan Detmeister estimates that BLS is now collecting about 18% fewer price quotes for the inflation report than it did a few months ago.,"Adding to the BLS's turmoil is a government-wide hiring freeze that has forced it to cut back on the amount of data it collects for each inflation report, the agency has said."
"Trump nominates conservative economist to head agency that compiles jobs, inflation data",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-nominates-conservative-economist-to-head-agency-that-compiles-jobs-inflation-data-2025-08-11/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Monday that he has nominated E.J. Antoni, chief economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation, to head the agency that compiles and publishes the nation's employment and inflation figures. “Our Economy is booming, and E.J. will ensure that the Numbers released are HONEST and ACCURATE,” Trump said on social media late Monday. Antoni, if approved by the Senate, would replace Erika McEntarfer, who was appointed commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics by former President Joe Biden. Trump fired McEntarfer Aug. 1 after the July jobs report showed hiring slowed sharply this spring, with job gains in May and June revised much lower than initially estimated. Trump accused McEntarfer, without evidence, of rigging the jobs data for political reasons. The announcement comes one day before the BLS is scheduled to release the latest inflation data, for July. It is forecast to show that consumer prices rose for the third straight month as tariffs are pushing up the cost of many imported goods. Antoni has criticized the bureau's' collection and publication of the jobs data for years, particularly since the COVID-19 pandemic, after which the agency has frequently revised its initial jobs estimates lower. Many conservatives have argued that this potentially benefited Biden by producing a large initial monthly job gain, only to have it reduced in subsequent months. However, revisions — including downward revisions — are not unusual and occurred during the Trump administration as well. Overall hiring jumped after the pandemic and the unemployment rate stayed low even after the revisions. Antoni called for McEntarfer to be fired after the jobs report was released Aug. 1. Last Monday he wrote on X, “There are better ways to collect, process, and disseminate data — that is the task for the next BLS commissioner, and only consistent delivery of accurate data in a timely manner will rebuild the trust that has been lost over the last several years.” The BLS commissioner is the only political appointee at the agency, which is otherwise staffed by career civil servants. Most previous commissioners have been mild-mannered technocrats. Antoni, however, has been an unabashed partisan in his economic analyses posted on the Heritage website. For example, two months ago, in an analysis of the May jobs report, he wrote, “A deep dive into the report shows any weakness started long before the Trump administration, which is making undeniable progress reprivatizing the economy.” Antoni's nomination quickly attracted an unusual level of criticism. Jason Furman, a top economist in the Obama administration, wrote on X: “I don’t think I have ever publicly criticized any Presidential nominee before. But E.J. Antoni is completely unqualified to be BLS Commissioner. He is an extreme partisan and does not have any relevant expertise.” Kyle Pomeleau, a tax expert for the right-leaning Tax Foundation and the conservative American Enterprise Institute, wrote on X: “There are a lot of competent conservative economists that could do this job. E.J. is not one of them."" ___ Associated Press writer Josh Boak contributed to this report.","Last Monday he wrote on X, “There are better ways to collect, process, and disseminate data — that is the task for the next BLS commissioner, and only consistent delivery of accurate data in a timely manner will rebuild the trust that has been lost over the last several years.” The BLS commissioner is the only political appointee at the agency, which is otherwise staffed by career civil servants.","Last Monday he wrote on X, “There are better ways to collect, process, and disseminate data — that is the task for the next BLS commissioner, and only consistent delivery of accurate data in a timely manner will rebuild the trust that has been lost over the last several years.” The BLS commissioner is the only political appointee at the agency, which is otherwise staffed by career civil servants.","Trump fired McEntarfer Aug. 1 after the July jobs report showed hiring slowed sharply this spring, with job gains in May and June revised much lower than initially estimated.","Last Monday he wrote on X, “There are better ways to collect, process, and disseminate data — that is the task for the next BLS commissioner, and only consistent delivery of accurate data in a timely manner will rebuild the trust that has been lost over the last several years.” The BLS commissioner is the only political appointee at the agency, which is otherwise staffed by career civil servants."
"Business spat between Daryl Hall and John Oates has been resolved in arbitration, attorneys say",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/business-spat-between-daryl-hall-and-john-oates-has-been-resolved-in-arbitration-attorneys-say-2025-08-11/,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Daryl Hall and John Oates have resolved their dispute over a Hall & Oates business partnership through arbitration, reaching a private ending after details of their rift went public in court documents filed in a 2023 lawsuit by Hall against Oates, according to a court filing Monday. In Monday's status report, attorneys for Hall noted the case received a final judgment in arbitration and they filed a proposed order for the judge, Nashville Chancellor Russell Perkins, to dismiss the case. In mid-July, Perkins ordered Hall's attorneys to offer an update in the case, which had last seen a public filing in December 2023. It's unclear when the arbitration process was finalized. And details were not revealed about the arbitration outcome between the duo who made music together for more than a half century, including hits in the 1970s and ’80s such as “Maneater,” “Rich Girl” “Kiss on My List” and “I Can’t Go for That (No Can Do).” Robb Harvey, an attorney for Hall, declined to comment. Representatives for Oates did not immediately respond to The Associated Press’ request for comment. In 2023 filings in the case, Hall accused Oates of blindsiding and betraying him, saying their relationship and his trust in Oates have deteriorated. Oates replied that he was “deeply hurt” that Hall was making “inflammatory, outlandish, and inaccurate statements” about him. The judge had paused the sale of Oates’ stake in Whole Oats Enterprises LLP to Primary Wave IP Investment Management LLC. Whole Oats includes valuable Hall & Oates materials such as trademarks, personal name and likeness rights, record royalty income and website and social media assets, a court declaration says. The dispute went public in November 2023, when Hall filed the lawsuit asking the judge to stop the sale by Oates so private arbitration could begin. Hall gave a scathing account of their relationship in early November 2023 during arbitration, and it was made public later in the month in the lawsuit. It alleges that Oates and his team engaged in the “ultimate partnership betrayal” by pushing to sell his share while telling Hall’s associates that he wanted to maintain his ownership. In his own declaration, Oates expressed disappointment with his longtime partner’s words, saying Hall’s accusations that Oates went behind his back and breached their agreement aren’t true. Oates declined to go into specifics, saying he’s obligated to keep details private, even if Hall didn’t. Last year, Oates told The Associated Press that he's had “no communication” with Hall and declined to discuss the legal proceedings. He did not see a Hall & Oates reunion in his future. “I personally don’t see it happening. It’s not in my plans at all. You can ask Daryl Hall what he thinks. But for me personally, no,” he says. The Times asked Hall in February if the ship had sailed on mending the pair's relationship. “That ship has gone to the bottom of the ocean,” Hall told the news outlet. “I’ve had a lot of surprises in my life, disappointments, betrayals, so I’m kind of used to it.” ___ Maria Sherman in New York contributed to this report.","NASHVILLE, Tenn.

MNDY Stock Has a Case of the Mondays—Buy Before the Rebound,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/mndy-stock-has-a-case-of-the-mondaysbuy-before-the-rebound/,"Monday.com’s NASDAQ: MNDY August price plunge is not easy for its stockholders to watch, but there is good news. The drop is a knee-jerk reaction to tepid news compounded by relatively high short interest that discounts the company’s long-term outlook. It will likely not last long. Trading at roughly 7x the long-term earnings forecast ahead of the release, the nearly 20% price plunge deepened the value in this well-positioned cash-generating machine. Monday.com is a leader in workflow management and AI-empowered automation. Its technology and services enable organizations to automate workflows, manage projects more efficiently, and streamline operations, and are gaining traction with businesses and industries worldwide. Monday.com reported a solid quarter with only two things marring the results. The first point is that growth is slowing sequentially, and compared to last year, the second is that the Q3 guidance was only as expected. The takeaway for investors is that growth was expected to slow, results were better-than-forecast, and Q3 guidance had been sufficient to sustain the higher share price ahead of the release; there is no reason why it shouldn’t be afterward. The more critical detail is that the Q2 strengths are expected to linger, and the full-year guide was improved. As of early to mid-August, the company's forecast indicates revenue growth of roughly 26%, which is 200 basis points hotter than MarketBeat’s reported consensus. Due to the business trends, this may be considered cautious guidance. The Q2 results are solid. The company outperformed MarketBeat’s reported consensus by more than 100 basis points, growing revenue by nearly 27% compared to last year. The gains were driven by an 8% increase in clients and an 11% increase in existing business, driven by the company’s largest client groups. They grew by 36% and 46% respectively. The margin news is also healthy. The company increased its R&D and faced expense hurdles, but managed to outperform the market’s expectations. The net result is a 100-basis-point contraction in the adjusted operating margin and $1.09 in adjusted EPS, up only 16% year-over-year (YOY) compared to the 26.6% top-line advance, but more than 2500 basis points better than expected and sufficient to produce a significant gain in shareholder value. Monday.com’s balance sheet health and growth are tied to dilutive share sales, but the company deploys capital efficiently and produces value for investors. The 2% YOY increase in share count and increased liability are offset by increased cash, current and total assets, which lifted equity by 18% year-to-date. Equity is expected to continue rising as the year progresses and drive robust support from the sell-side. Institutions, which own about 75% of the stock, provide a solid support base in 2025, and they are buying on balance as of mid-Q3 2025. The analysts, the vocal portion of the group, also provide solid support with their coverage increasing, sentiment firming, and price targets rising ahead of the release, indicating a deep value. Already trading below the low-end of the analysts' range ahead of the release, the post-release price plunge puts the stock well below, suggesting a minimum of 50% upside with the potential for a 75% gain at the consensus. Monday.com’s price decline may extend to even deeper levels, but there are signs that support is strong near $200. Numerous price upswings, including two in 2024 and two in early 2025, not only show support at the $200 level but also rising support aligning with an uptrend. The likely outcome is that, based on the results, valuation, and trends of institutions and analysts, this level will continue to serve as support. The market may consolidate near $200 before rebounding, but a rebound and fresh long-term highs are likely within a few quarters. Before you consider monday.com, you'll want to hear this.","The likely outcome is that, based on the results, valuation, and trends of institutions and analysts, this level will continue to serve as support.","The net result is a 100-basis-point contraction in the adjusted operating margin and $1.09 in adjusted EPS, up only 16% year-over-year (YOY) compared to the 26.6% top-line advance, but more than 2500 basis points better than expected and sufficient to produce a significant gain in shareholder value.","Monday.com’s price decline may extend to even deeper levels, but there are signs that support is strong near $200.","Already trading below the low-end of the analysts' range ahead of the release, the post-release price plunge puts the stock well below, suggesting a minimum of 50% upside with the potential for a 75% gain at the consensus."
Increasing the danger: Journalist killing in Gaza sends a chilling message,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/increasing-the-danger-journalist-killing-in-gaza-sends-a-chilling-message-2025-08-11/,"Israel's targeted killing of an Al Jazeera correspondent in Gaza over the weekend was noteworthy even for a conflict remarkably blood-soaked for journalists, leaving some experts to marvel that any news at all emerges from the territory. An Al Jazeera executive said Monday that it won't back down from covering what is going on there and called for news organizations to step up and recruit more journalists. A total of 184 Palestinian journalists and media workers have been killed by Israel in the Gaza war since its start in October 2023, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. That compares to the 18 journalists and media workers killed so far in the Russia-Ukraine war, CPJ said. Aside from rare guided tours, Israel has barred international media from covering the 22-month war in Gaza. News organizations instead rely largely on Palestinian Gaza residents and ingenuity to show the world what is happening there. Israel often questions the affiliations and biases of Palestinian journalists but doesn't permit others in. “You simply are in awe when stories show up,” said Jane Ferguson, a veteran war correspondent and founder of Noosphere, an independent platform for journalists. She can't recall a conflict that has been more difficult for reporters to cover, and she's reported from South Sudan, Syria and Afghanistan. Correspondent Anas al-Sharif knew he was a target, and left behind a message to be delivered upon his death. He and seven other people — six of them journalists — were killed in an air strike outside of Gaza City’s largest hospital complex on Sunday. Israel swiftly claimed responsibility, saying without producing evidence that al-Sharif had led a Hamas cell. It was a claim the news organization and al-Sharif had denied. Agence France-Presse, The Associated Press, BBC News and Reuters are among the organizations regularly reporting from Gaza. An Aug. 7 AP dispatch vividly described the hunger faced by many in Gaza: “A single bowl of eggplant stewed in watery tomato juice must sustain Sally Muzhed's family of six for the day. She calls it moussaka, but it's a pale echo of the fragrant, lawyered, meat-and-vegetable dish that once filled Gaza's kitchens with its aroma.” Other recent AP reports carried images and text reporting from the aftermath of an Israeli strike on Gaza's only Catholic church, and a profile of an 18-year-old aspiring doctor now trying to survive sheltered in a tent. Journalists from The Washington Post and the Guardian recently accompanied a Jordanian relief mission and took images of Gaza from the air, despite some restrictions from Israel. The Guardian's Lorenzo Tondo wrote: “Seen from the air, Gaza looks like the ruins of an ancient civilization, brought to light after centuries of darkness.” None of the organizations match the power and immediacy of Al Jazeera, however, in part because their correspondents have been in front of cameras. They've also paid the heaviest price: CPJ estimates that 11 journalists and media workers affiliated with AJ have been killed in the Gaza conflict, more than any other single organization. In a social media post written in June to be sent if he was killed, al-Sharif wrote that “I have lived through pain in all its details, tasted suffering and loss many times, yet I never once hesitated to convey the truth as it is, without distortion or falsification — so that Allah may bear witness against those who stayed silent.” In another posting on X on Aug. 10, the day that he was killed, al-Sharif wrote of the challenges covering the aftermath of one attack. He said he lost his strength and ability to express himself when he arrived at the scene. “Body parts and blood were all around us, and corpses were scattered on top of each other,” he wrote. “Tell me what words and phrases could help any journalist describe this horrific image. When I told you on air that it was an ‘indescribable scene,' I was truly helpless in the face of this horrific sight.” Salah Negm, news director at Al Jazeera English, said Monday it is very difficult to get people in to Gaza. But it is full of educated people and those with training in journalism who can help get stories out. He called on other news organizations to step up. “We get the news from several sources on the ground in Gaza — not only journalists but also doctors, hospitals, civil servants, aid workers,” Negm said. “A lot of people in Gaza talk to us.” Many of the journalists working in Gaza are facing the same struggles to find food, for themselves and their families, as the people they are covering. Noosphere's Ferguson said she's never before had to ask a reporter whether she had enough food for herself and her child. In an interview in May on “Democracy Now!,” 22-year-old journalist Abubaker Abed described the difficult decision he made to leave Gaza to pursue his education in Ireland. Not only was he suffering from malnutrition, he said, but his mother was concerned that his work as a journalist would make him and his family targets. “If I stayed, I would die,” he said. Jodie Ginsberg, CEO of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said she's concerned about the implications for journalists in future conflicts if what is happening in Gaza is allowed to continue without international condemnation that has real teeth. “They're essentially admitting in public to what amounts to a war crime,” Ginsberg said, “and they can do that because none of the other attacks on journalists have had any consequences. not in this war and not prior. It's not surprising that it can act with this level of impunity because no international government has really taken it to task.” Given all that they face, “to me, the most remarkable thing is that journalists are continuing to cover (Gaza) at all,” she said. ___ Laurie Kellman and Danica Kirk in London, Samy Magdy in Cairo and Sam Metz in Jerusalem contributed to this report.

IPO Market Stays Hot With These 2 Debuting Stocks,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/ipo-market-stays-hot-with-these-2-debuting-stocks/,"It’s a hot IPO summer as new listings make their long-awaited return to public markets. After a cool first half of 2025, the demand for Initial Public Offerings has exploded in Q3, with anticipated companies like Circle Internet Group Inc. NYSE: CRCL and CoreWeave Inc. NASDAQ: CRWV surpassing even the rosiest expectations upon their debut. And it doesn’t appear that momentum is slowing as several more promising companies are unveiling their listings. A range of factors has kept the IPO market subdued recently. Not only was the macro-environment poor in the first half of 2025 due to erratic trade policies, but private companies have been staying private longer than historical norms. According to research from Morgan Stanley, companies are now staying private for nearly 11 years on average before going public, a significant increase over the seven-year average from 2014. Private companies aren’t scrutinized as closely as their publicly traded counterparts, and high rates have clogged the capital spigot over the last few years. Couple these factors with the rise of private markets, and there simply isn’t the enthusiasm for ‘going public’ as there was in the past. Only 84 IPOs were issued in the first half of 2025, down from over 100 in the same period last year. If there’s light at the end of the tunnel, it began shining earlier this summer. We’ve seen several new listings hit the market, and many have grown exponentially in the first day or week of trading. Three reasons for the turnaround include: The first wave of big IPOs this year saw companies like CoreWeave and Circle achieve impressive gains before volatility muted the fun. But July was another banner month for new issues; here are two debuting stocks to keep on your radar. The biggest IPO debut since CoreWeave, Figma Inc. NYSE: FIG, got off to an absurd start even before shares went public. After initially looking at an opening price between $25 - $28, the stock debuted at $33 and quickly rose toward $100 before hitting the exchanges. By the end of the first day, FIG shares were trading at $115, a shocking gain of more than 200% from the opening price. Figma has the financial data to back up its exciting first-week performance. The company has more than 13 million active users and earned more than $228 million in revenue in Q1 2025 (a 46% year-over-year (YOY) increase), with a net income of $44.9 million. FIG’s market cap surged over $67 billion after the first day of trading, although a 35% pullback sent shares back under $80 in the subsequent five sessions. Figma’s unique platform allows designers and professionals to collaborate on different interfaces in real-time, and with 85% of current customers outside the United States, the growth prospects remain strong despite the hefty valuation at about 40x sales. Figma’s impressive list of corporate clients includes Stripe, Duolingo, and Netflix Inc. NASDAQ: NFLX. If you don’t mind seeing Ryan Reynolds in the C-suite and have an interest in innovative AI-based advertising companies, MNTN Inc. NYSE: MNTN could be an intriguing investment. Pronounced ‘Mountain,’ the company has a platform called Performance TV, which helps clients create specific, tailored advertising plans targeting viewers based on their Connected TV watching habits and demographics. Connected TV is simply any TV with an internet connection, such as a Roku TV or Amazon Fire TV Stick. MNTN reported its first earnings release as a public company on August 5, which missed analysts’ expectations on EPS but surpassed revenue estimates by 6%. The $68.46 million in revenue represented a 25% YOY increase, and the company has a distinct first-mover advantage in this space thanks to partnerships with Peacock, ESPN, CBS, and Fox. MarketBeat is already tracking 10 analysts covering the stock, with two Hold ratings and eight Buy ratings. The consensus price target is $29.90, which suggests upside of nearly 20% from current prices.

"Taiwan Semiconductor Stock: Own It, Don't Trade It",https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/taiwan-semiconductor-stock-own-it-dont-trade-it/,"One of the biggest mistakes investors can make is constantly trading in and out of the wrong stocks, triggering one taxable event after another on their gains. While some smaller, more volatile stocks may lend themselves to short-term trading, others call for the opposite approach—a steady buy-and-hold strategy. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing NYSE: TSM fits squarely into that second category. As a dominant force in the semiconductor industry, it holds a massive footprint in one of technology’s hottest areas. The sector is on the verge of major change as the United States moves to onshore chip manufacturing, especially with new trade tariffs targeting countries that supply much of the world’s semiconductors. With this in mind, Taiwan Semiconductor is a stock best suited for long-term accumulation—buying gradually and holding for an indefinite period. The reason goes beyond the company’s staggering $1 trillion market value. It also lies in the major investments and expansion into the United States that are set to unfold in the coming years. There has never been an invalid bull case for this company. Still, today more than ever, investors should stay alert to the underlying issues that could push this stock to new record highs. Even though it already trades at 97% of its 52-week high, chances are new ceilings will be made in the coming quarters and years, despite what volatility may come its way. The reason is that President Trump is now increasing tariffs on semiconductors, and as recently announced on a live CNBC interview, his rollout points to a high of 200% tariffs by 2027, giving companies like Taiwan Semiconductors a concrete timeline to get their manufacturing capacity within the United States. This means investors can get in early on this massive move, as onshoring its presence will also allow Taiwan Semiconductor to remain one of the leading names in semiconductor equipment and technology, most of which is used by other giants of industry like NVIDIA Co. NASDAQ: NVDA and Apple Inc. NASDAQ: AAPL. With a few years of gains nearly spelled out for investors, selling at the current highs would be futile, since they would only have to keep buying higher and higher, again stacking up more tax events for themselves unnecessarily. In fact, anyone who sells this stock today is most likely doing it for portfolio weighing reasons. For instance, institutional investors from Sanders Capital recently offloaded 7.8% of their massive $8.7 billion position in Taiwan Semiconductor. This should not be seen as a bearish sign, considering that this stock represents 11.6% of their portfolio, a recent run to 52-week highs likely bloated the stock to become too big a name in their book. This is a common practice at investment funds, where they reduce a name’s weight in a portfolio to avoid it becoming too big a constituent, thereby not necessarily indicating a change in sentiment or view toward the company. This is a more abstract question that can be answered in the same way as it is traditionally responded to by investment banks on Wall Street. Taiwan Semiconductor stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 27.6x today, but it still offers a steep discount to the rest of the computer sector’s average of 50.3x. Perhaps some investors and analysts had discounted this stock due to fears that it was so exposed to the Asian region, where most trade tariffs seem to be focused. However, changing the game plan to onshoring in the United States renders this bearish view useless. That change alone could be the catalyst to bring Taiwan Semiconductor stock to a valuation more in line with where the rest of its peers are trading today in terms of P/E multiples. More than that, the fundamental story is strong enough today to make this happen. In the latest quarterly announcement, Taiwan Semiconductor's stock reported $2.47 in earnings per share (EPS) compared to the Wall Street consensus for only $2.13, reiterating the fact that even analysts may be looking at this company through an overly conservative lens. As compliance with global tariffs and changes in demographics clear the way for future growth, further EPS beats in the future may very well start to deliver the sort of upside Taiwan Semiconductor has been missing out on compared to peers. Therefore, trading this stock would be a costly mistake for impatient investors; this is a buy-and-hold name.

AOL is finally shutting down its dial-up internet service,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/aol-is-finally-shutting-down-its-dial-up-internet-service-2025-08-11/,"NEW YORK (AP) — AOL's dial-up internet is finally taking its last bow. Yes, while perhaps a dinosaur by today's digital standards, dial-up is still around. But AOL says it's officially pulling the plug for its service on Sept. 30. ""AOL routinely evaluates its products and services and has decided to discontinue Dial-up Internet,"" AOL wrote in a brief update on its support site — noting that dial-up and associated software “optimized for older operating systems"" will soon be unavailable on AOL plans. AOL, formerly America Online, introduced many households to the world wide web for the first time when its dial-up service launched decades ago, rising to prominence particularly in the 90s and early 2000s. The creaky door to the internet was characterized by a once-ubiquitous series of beeps and buzzes heard over the phone used to connect your computer online — along with frustrations of being kicked off the web if anyone else at home needed the landline for another call, and an endless bombardment of CDs mailed out by AOL to advertise free trials. Eventually, broadband and wireless offerings emerged and rose to dominance, doing away with dial-up's quirks for most people accessing the internet today. Still, a handful of consumers have continued to rely on internet services connected over telephone lines. In the U.S., according to Census Bureau data, an estimated 163,401 households were using dial-up alone to get online in 2023, representing just over 0.13% of all homes with internet subscriptions nationwide. AOL was the largest dial-up internet provider for some time, but not the only one to emerge over the years. Some smaller internet providers continue to offer dial-up today. Regardless, the decline of dial-up has been a long time coming. And AOL shutting down its service arrives as other relics of the internet's earlier days continue to disappear. Microsoft retired video calling service Skype just earlier this year, for example — as well as Internet Explorer back in 2022. And in 2017, AOL discontinued its Instant Messenger — a chat platform that was once lauded as the biggest trend in online communication since email when it was founded in 1997, but later struggled to ward off rivals. AOL itself is far from the dominant internet player it was decades ago — when, beyond dial-up and IMs, the company also became known for its “You’ve got mail” catchphrase that greeted users who checked their inboxes, as famously displayed in the 1998 film starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan by the same name. Before it was America Online, AOL was founded as Quantum Computer Services in 1985. It soon rebranded and hit the public market in 1991. Near the height of the dot-com boom, AOL's market value reached nearly $164 billion in 2000. But tumultuous years followed, and that valuation plummeted as the once-tech pioneer bounced between multiple owners. After a disastrous merger with Time Warner Inc., Verizon acquired AOL — which later sold AOL, along with Yahoo, to a private equity firm. At the time Verzion announced that sale to in 2021, an anonymous source familiar with the transaction told CNBC that the number of AOL dial-up users was “in the low thousands,"" down from 2.1 million when Verzion first moved to acquire AOL in 2015 — and far below peak demand seen back in the 90s and early 2000s. But beyond dial-up, AOL continues to offer its free email services, as well as subscriptions that advertise identity protection and other tech support.","But beyond dial-up, AOL continues to offer its free email services, as well as subscriptions that advertise identity protection and other tech support.","At the time Verzion announced that sale to in 2021, an anonymous source familiar with the transaction told CNBC that the number of AOL dial-up users was “in the low thousands,"" down from 2.1 million when Verzion first moved to acquire AOL in 2015 — and far below peak demand seen back in the 90s and early 2000s.",And AOL shutting down its service arrives as other relics of the internet's earlier days continue to disappear.,"At the time Verzion announced that sale to in 2021, an anonymous source familiar with the transaction told CNBC that the number of AOL dial-up users was “in the low thousands,"" down from 2.1 million when Verzion first moved to acquire AOL in 2015 — and far below peak demand seen back in the 90s and early 2000s."

4 Stocks That May Get a Big Earnings Bump This Week,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/4-stocks-that-may-get-a-big-earnings-bump-this-week/,"As Amazon.com Inc. NASDAQ: AMZN reminds us, sometimes it can be difficult to predict how the market will respond to a company's earnings report, even if the firm comes out ahead of analyst expectations for earnings and revenue. Amazon's dip following its latest report, despite top- and bottom-line beats, shows that sometimes details like forward guidance or the suggestion of short-term difficulties can be enough to undo any investor goodwill that may have built. With that in mind, it's impossible to predict how the four companies below will fare as they report earnings the week of August 11. However, each of them stands out from its industry peers for its strong support from analysts and enjoys other potential selling points. We'll take a closer look for anyone considering a purchase before earnings results come in. Applied Materials Inc. NASDAQ: AMAT provides technologies essential to the manufacturing of chips, DRAM, and NAND memory, making it a key player in the AI/data center niche. However, the company's addressable market goes well beyond that space, and Applied Materials may play a hand in the construction of everything from personal computers and smartphones to cloud servers, among many other things. The chip foundry market is expected to grow rapidly in the coming years, which should keep demand for Applied Materials' Etch and eBeam products and technology high. The company also recently announced a partnership with Apple Inc. NASDAQ: AAPL and Texas Instruments Inc. NASDAQ: TXN to supply American-made manufacturing equipment. Thus, the firm is poised to benefit from a regulatory landscape strongly favoring domestic chip production. While these last points will not factor into Applied Materials' most recent earnings quarter, analysts are optimistic and expect earnings to grow by 7.4% this year. Seventeen out of 25 analysts have rated AMAT shares a Buy, and the stock could have more than 10% in near-term upside potential based on price targets. Packaging products giant Amcor plc NYSE: AMCR is likely to get a boost in its earnings report this week, the company's fiscal fourth-quarter report, thanks to its all-stock combination with packaging rival Berry Global. The deal, valued at over $8 billion, was completed by the end of April 2025, within the latest quarter. Amcor has said the acquisition should provide 12% earnings per share (EPS) accretion in fiscal 2026 and at least 35% in EPS accretion by the end of fiscal 2028. It's difficult to say exactly how much of this impact may be felt so early on, but signs of success in this area could excite investors, giving AMCR shares a boost. Particularly if the company can maintain its strong cash flow and attractive valuation, shares could get a bump. This may be why eight out of 10 analysts view AMCR shares as a Buy. Based on analyst price targets, the company also has more than 19% upside potential. Singaporean internet and mobile platform firm Sea Ltd. NYSE: SE has made significant inroads into the digital financial services space. This should help the company continue to dominate in the Southeast Asian region, where it already has a considerable market share for its e-commerce platform. On the other hand, short interest has risen by about 2.5% in the last month, perhaps owing to the company's high valuation, which currently trades at a P/E ratio of more than 104. However, that lofty valuation is not a concern for most analysts. Ten out of 13 view it as a Buy, and a consensus price target of $159.82 suggests the stock still has room to climb about 8.2% in the near term. Perhaps even more interesting for investors watching the company's upcoming earnings report is the analyst conviction that Sea's earnings could quadruple in the coming year to $2.96 per share. Credit-tech platform 360 Jietiao is backed by Qifu Technology Inc. NASDAQ: QFIN, though the parent company is in the midst of a rebranding and name change. Nonetheless, Qifu gives investors many reasons to consider it despite being an overlooked name in the Chinese market. Recent earnings successes, significant partnerships with multiple municipal banks in China, and big gains in loan facilitation and origination volume should all drive interest. Analysts expect earnings to grow by nearly 12% in the coming year. QFIN shares are only rated by three analysts in the United States, but each has assigned a Buy rating. According to price targets, shares could rise by 55%. Before you consider Applied Materials, you'll want to hear this.","As Amazon.com Inc.

Why SoundHound AI's Earnings Show the Stock Can Move Higher,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/why-soundhound-ais-earnings-show-the-stock-can-move-higher/,"One of the most important questions investors need to ask during and after an earnings announcement for a stock is whether growth has been priced in or not. Typically, the days after a stock moves on earnings are when broader market participants attempt to land on a fair price that reflects the important information they’ve just received, and that is where some will fall off the track. Others will stick to the right narrative for further gains. That question is being asked for shares of SoundHound AI Inc. NASDAQ: SOUN after the stock rallied by over 26% in a single day after reporting its latest quarterly earnings results. Not only is this a critical time to be aware of what comes next, but this one is particularly tricky, considering the company has yet to achieve net profitability per share, sending some investors into a cloud of doubt. Today, some of those doubts will be removed as investors hone in on the numbers that really matter and explain why the macro backdrop stands to help SoundHound’s services and technology into another wave of expansion for the coming quarters. When it comes to the technology sector, this stock is as good as any other despite not having net profitability. Here’s why that is. For this $5.4 billion company, a 26% rally takes more than just a good quarter and justified attention from the market overall. As most investors are focused on the semiconductor and chipmaking areas of this artificial intelligence race, such a move implies that sentiment and attention might be shifting into other areas. However, SoundHound's bull case comes from a much broader thesis. As President Trump changes migration policies in the United States, industries like retail and service-based companies see some of their workforce demographics change. The remaining ones are now overloaded with more work to compensate for the gap. In recent employment reports, it is no surprise that many workers are asking for higher wages. If businesses agree to these increases, they face two options: pass the added costs on to consumers, which could fuel inflation, or invest in technology to improve efficiency. This is why SoundHound’s earnings show that the company’s services are contracted across several restaurant brands. Red Lobster, Applebee’s, IHOP, and others have sought to add SoundHound’s artificial intelligence capabilities to expedite their service process, efficiently reducing some costs to accommodate potential higher wages. And that’s not all. SoundHound has been a successful case study in other industries, such as healthcare, retail, financial services, and even automotive. Even Chinese car manufacturers have contracted SoundHound’s software to be integrated into their vehicles, a massive growth market for the company’s future. With all these tailwinds in mind, investors shouldn’t be surprised to see the company’s net revenue grow to $42.7 million this quarter, a massive 217% increase from the same quarter last year, a record in the company’s history. Even after this 26% rally and critical footprint expansion, SoundHound stock still trades at a dismal 54% of its 52-week high, meaning investors can still enjoy a discounted opportunity to be exposed to this further growth down the line. Moreover, enough bears are out there to trigger a jet-fueled rally higher. Considering that short positions in SoundHound stock now amount to $1.4 billion, or 33.7% of the total float, another rally like the one investors just witnessed could trigger what’s known as a short squeeze. This is an event where short sellers are forced to close their positions at a loss, which involves buying back the stock. This additional buying pressure, worth up to $1.4 billion, would be a massive boost in terms of demand for the stock, and it will be translated into higher prices if this happens. Now, for the other side of the equation, the recent earnings did trigger new institutional buying interest for this company. Those from Geode Capital Management justified boosting their holdings in SoundHound stock by 8.3% as of the day of the earnings release, bringing their entire position to a high of $94.8 million or 2.2% ownership in the whole company. This is not something investors should take lightly. Institutions often stay away from companies this small, so when they decide to move into them, chances are they are expecting a higher long-term run backed by fundamentals, as investors can verify today for SoundHound. With this much financial momentum, it’s a matter of time before this stock reports net profitability and retests old 52-week highs of just under $25 per share.

"Post-Earnings, How Does D-Wave Stack Up Against Quantum Rivals?",https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/post-earnings-how-does-d-wave-stack-up-against-quantum-rivals/,"Rising quantum computing star D-Wave Quantum Inc. NYSE: QBTS posted mixed earnings results in early August 2025, as revenue growth surpassed analyst predictions but losses came in wider than expected. Though not the unqualified positive signal some bullish investors were likely hoping for, D-Wave's earnings did not dent the short-term stock performance; shares remain up almost 20% in the last month. Given the emerging nature of the industry, each new earnings cycle drives new speculation among investors about which quantum firm or firms may be best positioned to take the lead. Investors are likely wondering how D-Wave stacks up against competitors like IonQ Inc. NYSE: IONQ and Quantum Computing Inc. NASDAQ: QUBT in light of the latest financial information. With a 42% year-over-year (YOY) surge in revenue and bookings nearly doubling to $1.3 million over the same period, D-Wave may have eased concerns about marketability in this latest earnings round. With its Advantage2 system now generally available, the company is looking forward to additional sales, as well as a series of upgrades of earlier systems already operational for multiple customers. Additionally, D-Wave's marketability proposition is further strengthened by the company's announcements surrounding major partnerships with an unnamed large aerospace and defense firm as well as law enforcement in North Wales. The more use cases of D-Wave's technology that emerge, the more likely it seems that the company will be able to draw additional interest across industries. Finally, D-Wave's advantageous cash position remains a boon. The company ended the quarter with an incredible $819 in cash reserves, positioning it well to continue to advance its technological developments—such as cryogenic packaging, which could be key to unlocking advances in gate-model tech, so far a gap for the firm—and to put forward an M&A strategy. Among D-Wave's competitors, one of the most direct comparisons is IonQ, which also reported second-quarter earnings in the same week. This rival is more than double the size of D-Wave by market cap, and its revenue is quite a bit higher as well. What's more, IonQ revenue increased YOY at roughly double the pace of D-Wave's—81.6% for IonQ compared to 40.9% for D-Wave. This brought IonQ to a tidy $3.5 million revenue surprise and a total of $20.7 million in revenue for the quarter, driven by new and expanding business in Japan, South Korea, and elsewhere. IonQ's growing global footprint should concern D-Wave investors, although the latter firm is also making aggressive moves to establish an international presence. However, IonQ shares D-Wave's profitability woes: losses per share of 70 cents widened significantly YOY and missed expectations by an eye-opening 57 cents. Investors did not react negatively to this news, though, and IonQ shares remain up more than 9% in the last month. Perhaps one reason for this is that the widening losses are mostly attributable to operating expenses which tripled YOY as the firm boosted its R&D spending by 231%. Spending heavily to advance technology may be a worthwhile trade-off, even if it means bigger losses in the short term. Finally, IonQ is gaining attention from major tech firms, an update that could boost the company's prospects significantly. Amazon.com Inc. NASDAQ: AMZN recently bought an equity stake in IonQ worth about $37 million. Though not a huge purchase, it could signal the e-commerce giant's interest in partnering with IonQ on a range of services going forward. Additionally, IonQ's hardware is available through Microsoft's Azure cloud computing platform, despite the fact that the larger firm is also building its own quantum tech. All of these could give IonQ a critical leg up on D-Wave. Firms like Quantum Computing report earnings on a different schedule—this firm is slated to report its second-quarter fiscal 2025 results in early October. Still, there are some noteworthy aspects of Quantum Computing's recent activity to keep in mind, and these warrant investor attention when it does post earnings updates as well. Quantum Computing posted positive earnings of 13 cents per share in its last report, although revenue was weak and below analyst predictions. The company's new foundry in Arizona is now operational, though, and that should accelerate revenue growth in future quarters, particularly into 2026.
