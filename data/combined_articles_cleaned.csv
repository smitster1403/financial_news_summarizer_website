Buy PG Electroplast; target of Rs 623: Geojit Financial Services,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-pg-electroplast-target-of-rs-623-geojit-financial-services-13462190.html,"Geojit Financial Services research report on PG Electroplast PG Electroplast Ltd (PGEL), the flagship entity of PG Group is a leading electronic manufacturing service provider in India, having a diverse portfolio and panIndia presence. In Q1FY26, PGEL reported a revenue growth of ~14% YoY, which is in line with our estimates. However, air conditioner sales faced significant headwinds due to the early onset of the monsoon, which disrupted the seasonal volumes. EBITDA margin declined by 183bps YoY to 8.1% due to negative operating leverage and input cost pressure. The company expects FY26 margin to decline by 1.25-1.5% YoY due to pricing pressure and higher channel inventory. PGEL expects inventory to be cleared in H2FY26 as the seasonal demand picks up. Washing machine sales were robust during the quarter, reported a growth of 36% YoY. PGEL expects the segment to grow 40-45% YoY in FY26. We expect the management’s focus to diversify to other business verticals like refrigerator, EV and compressor manufacturing to keep the longterm story intact. Outlook The stock is currently trading at its 3-year average 1-year forward P/E of 42x, and we expect most of the negatives are factored into the price. We therefore revise our rating to BUY with a downwardly revised TP of Rs 623, based on a P/E of 40x on FY27E EPS.

"Bajaj Finance, Axis Bank, HDFC Bank shares rise up to 6% on S&P upgrade, GST reform cheer",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/bajaj-finance-axis-bank-hdfc-bank-shares-rise-up-to-6-on-s-p-upgrade-gst-reform-cheer-13461688.html,"The shares of banks and non-banking financial institutions saw strong rise in the morning trading hours of August 18. The sharp rise in the share prices pushed the Nifty Bank and Nifty Financial Services indices higher in the deep green. The Nifty Bank index was up more than 1.3 percent to hover around 56,035, while the Nifty Financial Services index rose nearly 2 percent to stand at 26,810, as seen at 10.10 am. Here are some of the key reasons leading to the uptrend in the financial pocket of the stock market: S&P upgrade: International credit ratings agency S&P Global on August 15 upgraded ratings of top 10 financial institutions, saying that India's financial institutions will continue to ride the country's good economic growth momentum. S&P has raised long-term issuer credit ratings on seven Indian banks - State Bank of India (SBI), ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Union Bank of India, and Indian Bank, and three finance companies - Bajaj Finance, Tata Capital, and L&T Finance. ""We expect India's banks to maintain adequate asset quality, good profitability, and enhanced capitalization over the next 12-24 months. This is despite some pockets of stress,"" S&P said, adding, credit risk in the system has reduced. This boosted investor sentiment for the stocks, as well as the broader sector, a day after US-based agency raised India's sovereign credit rating. ""S&P upgrade...is a significant macro and structural positive for the overall Indian market, likely supporting incremental valuation expansion driven by lower bond yields and decreased risk perception. Moreover, a higher sovereign rating will drive better FPI debt flows and lead to better USDINR and GOI bond yields. Foreign currency-heavy borrowers can benefit from lower interest costs. Indian financial companies, such as Bajaj Finance, accessing the ECB market could see a 15-20bp reduction on their coupon payments,"" said Motilal Oswal Financial Services. GST reforms: While delivering his Independence Day speech, Prime Minister Narendra Modi hinted at the next generation of Goods and Services Tax (GST) reforms to be announced as a Diwali gift for consumers. The Centre has proposed to move towards ""simple tax"" with 2 slabs—""standard and merit"", with special rates applicable for only for select few items. According to reports, this will significantly reduce tax burden on consumers aiming to buy several items, like electronics and other consumer durables. More demand for consumer durables may in turn boost stocks like Bajaj Finance who offer affordable EMIs to consumers to purchase several goods. Broader market uptrend: The sharp rise in the share prices also comes amid broader optimism in the stock market today. Sensex jumped over 1,000 points to hover around 81,629, while Nifty crossed the key 25,000-mark level. HDFC AMC and several other stocks will likely be strongly benefitted from the optimism in the stock markets. Bajaj Finance shares jumped more than 6 percent, while Chola Finance, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company, Bajaj Finsev and SBI Life shares were up more than 4 percent, leading the strong gains on the Nifty Financial Services index. IndusInd Bank shares rose nearly 3 percent, while AU Small Finance Bank, IDFC First Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank shares were up nearly 2 percent each.

"Vodafone Idea shares rally 8% as Q1 losses narrow; ARPU beats estimates, subscribers decline slows",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/vodafone-idea-shares-rally-8-as-q1-losses-narrow-arpu-beats-estimates-subscribers-decline-slows-13461646.html,"Vodafone Idea shares rallied as much as 8.5 percent to Rs 6.68 in the morning on Monday, August 18, percent as investors took heart from the telco’s June quarter performance, where losses narrowed sequentially. The upbeat tone in the broader market also added to the momentum. At about 10:15 am, the stock was trading at Rs 6.62, higher by 7.7 percent from the last close on the NSE. Despite the day’s uptick, Vodafone Idea remains under pressure — down 21 percent so far in 2025 and having shed nearly 60 percent over the past year. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates The company reported its Q1FY26 numbers after market hours on August 14. Net loss came in at Rs 6,608 crore, wider than the Rs 6,432 crore loss a year ago but an improvement from Rs 7,166 crore reported in the March quarter. Revenue from operations stood at Rs 11,022 crore, up 5 percent year-on-year but flat sequentially. Average revenue per user (ARPU), a key operating metric, improved to Rs 177 against analyst expectations of Rs 167, aided by subscriber upgrades and a better customer mix. Motilal Oswal Financial Services noted that losses were narrower than its estimate of Rs 7,500 crore, helped by lower interest costs, while revenue trends were broadly in line. The brokerage also highlighted that subscriber erosion slowed during the quarter — Vodafone Idea’s user base slipped by just 0.5 million to 197.7 million, a sharp improvement from the 1.6 million decline seen in Q4FY25 and better than its forecast of a 1.2 million drop. Global brokerage UBS retained a Neutral stance on the stock with a target price of Rs 8.5, calling the June quarter performance broadly in line with expectations.

"JSPL, SAIL, Tata Steel shares shine after DGTR proposes three-year safeguard duty on key imports",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/steel-stocks-shine-after-dgtr-proposes-three-year-safeguard-duty-on-key-imports-13461459.html,"Shares of leading steel makers Jindal Steel, SAIL, Tata Steel, JSW Steel and JSL are sharply higher in early trade on August 18, after the Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) recommended a three-year safeguard duty on imports of some categories of flat steel products in order to protect the domestic industry from rising imports. The Nifty Metal index is higher by over 1.2 percent in early trade, led by Jindal Steel and SAIL, which are up by close to 2 percent. Once approved by the Finance Ministry, the safeguard duty will kick in at 12 percent in the first year, followed by 11.5 percent in the second year, and 11 percent in the third year. DGTR said the decision is due to a surge in steel imports, especially from China, along with a steep fall in domestic industry profits. A provisional 12 percent duty was already in place, imposed on April 21, 2025, and now, in the final order, DGTR has said that imports have risen 'recently, suddenly, sharply and significantly' between October 2023 to September 2024. This threatens to cause ""serious injury to the domestic industry/producers,"" the DGTR notification said. The current duty of 12 percent was to be in force till the end of September, and the imposition of the latest import levy is being seen as a positive move by the steel industry. The import duty has been recommended by the DGTR in its final report on a probe initiated following a complaint by the Indian Steel Association. The enquiry, initiated in December 2024, ranged across products like hot-rolled and cold-rolled steel, metallic and colour-coated steel. The Alloy Steel Producers Association of India (ASPA), representing players like Tata Steel and JSW Steel, had filed a petition on July 31, claiming that cheap imports from China were adversely affecting the industry. Another association, Indian Stainless Steel Development Association (ISSDA) too had filed an application with the DGTR to investigate the dumping of stainless steel items in the domestic market. However, trade think tank Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) has cautioned against the move to impose duty on Chinese import, stating that it will ""raise input costs, hurt export competitiveness, and squeeze downstream users."" The GTRI argued that the rise in imports was predictable and not 'sudden', and the domestic impact was being overstated. The safeguard duty on steel imports could cripple automotive, engineering, and construction sectors by increasing input costs, GTRI said in its note. GTRI added that more than 250 stakeholders - including automakers and electronics companies had opposed the duty, warning of higher input costs and an impact on export competitiveness. The sentiment in steel stocks was also helped by the announcement by JSW Steel that it is has signed a non-binding agreement South Korea’s POSCO Group to explore setting up a six million tonnes per annum (MTPA) integrated steel plant in India.","Shares of leading steel makers Jindal Steel, SAIL, Tata Steel, JSW Steel and JSL are sharply higher in early trade on August 18, after the Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) recommended a three-year safeguard duty on imports of some categories of flat steel products in order to protect the domestic industry from rising imports.","Shares of leading steel makers Jindal Steel, SAIL, Tata Steel, JSW Steel and JSL are sharply higher in early trade on August 18, after the Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) recommended a three-year safeguard duty on imports of some categories of flat steel products in order to protect the domestic industry from rising imports.","The safeguard duty on steel imports could cripple automotive, engineering, and construction sectors by increasing input costs, GTRI said in its note.","Shares of leading steel makers Jindal Steel, SAIL, Tata Steel, JSW Steel and JSL are sharply higher in early trade on August 18, after the Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) recommended a three-year safeguard duty on imports of some categories of flat steel products in order to protect the domestic industry from rising imports."

Hero MotoCorp was the star performer, rallying more than 8 percent to emerge as the top gainer on the Nifty. The move, reported by CNBC-TV18 citing sources, is part of the government’s push towards a two-tier GST regime — an idea highlighted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his Independence Day speech.

Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Currently, vehicles are taxed under multiple slabs combining GST and cess, depending on engine size, length and ground clearance. The government is now weighing a flat 18 percent levy on mass-market vehicles. This would bring two-wheelers under 350cc, small cars up to 1,200cc, and certain hybrids down sharply from the prevailing 28–31 percent range, while luxury cars and SUVs would continue to attract the top 40 percent bracket. Brokerages see widespread benefits across the auto value chain if the proposal goes through. Morgan Stanley noted that Hero MotoCorp and Eicher Motors stand to gain the most among two-wheelers, with Maruti Suzuki and M&M emerging as key beneficiaries in passenger vehicles. Emkay added that Hero MotoCorp, with a dominant 79 percent share in entry-level two-wheelers, and TVS Motor, which has a 25 percent share in scooters, would be at the forefront of gains. Ancillary suppliers with heavy exposure to two-wheelers, such as Pricol, Sandhar Technologies and ASK Automotive, could also benefit.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Eicher Motors, HDFC Life, Manappuram Finance, UNO Minda, Tube Investments, PB Fintech, and others on August 18?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-eicher-motors-hdfc-life-manappuram-finance-uno-minda-tube-investments-pb-fintech-and-others-on-august-18-13460767.html,"The benchmark indices closed flat with a positive bias on August 14, extending their upward journey for the second straight session, but the market breadth was in favour of bears. A total of 1,752 shares saw selling pressure compared to 1,128 shares that advanced on the NSE. The market is expected to remain in consolidation mode until it reclaims all key moving averages. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Osho Krishan, Chief Manager - Technical & Derivative Research at Angel One Manappuram Finance | CMP: Rs 266 Manappuram Finance has demonstrated a robust recovery over the last couple of trading weeks and has now surpassed all major EMAs on the daily chart. The stock has retraced to the neckline of the breakout and has gained traction again, suggesting potential for increased momentum in the short term. The alignment of momentum indicators with the positive crossover among EMAs and a robust increase in trading volumes during the recent period indicates the likelihood of sustained momentum in the foreseeable future. We recommend buying the stock around Rs 264–260. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 294, Rs 300 Stop-Loss: Rs 245 Titan Company | CMP: Rs 3,489.4 Titan Company has seen a decent surge in recent times, followed by consolidation resembling a ‘Double Bottom’ pattern on the daily chart structure. The stock has been hovering slightly above its 20 DEMA, with bullish bias. Additionally, the counter has witnessed a higher low formation on the daily chart and has showcased a positive crossover on technical indicators, adding to the bullish sentiment. The SuperTrend has also turned bullish after the recent surge. From a risk-reward point of view, the counter is firmly aligned with a favourable setup for the short to medium term. Hence, we recommend buying Titan around Rs 3,480–3,460. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,630, Rs 3,680 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,350 UNO Minda | CMP: Rs 1,149.8 UNO Minda has recently experienced a notable spurt in price and volume, characterized by a multi-week breakout. Additionally, the stock has been trading at new highs in the current calendar year, with favourable technical parameters suggesting a bullish bias. From a technical perspective, the MACD indicator has demonstrated a positive crossover around the zero line, contributing to an optimistic outlook for the stock. Hence, we recommend buying UNO Minda around Rs 1,120–1,100. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,250, Rs 1,260 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,040 Jay Mehta, Technical Research at JM Financial Services Tube Investments of India | CMP: Rs 3,063.6 Tube Investments of India, after breaking out from a double bottom pattern, was trading within a wedge formation. Recently, it broke above the wedge and is currently trading above its 20-day and 50-day EMAs, approaching its 200-day EMA. A breakout above the 200-day EMA could further strengthen its bullish momentum. Rising volumes indicate strong buying interest, supporting the bullish outlook. The stock has shown good relative strength and has outperformed the Nifty over the last 6 months. On the daily chart, the RSI stands at 63 with a positive crossover, trending upward, while the rising MACD histogram signals robust momentum. A bullish Marubozu candle on the weekly chart reinforces the strong continuation pattern. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,400, Rs 3,550 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,844 TBO Tek | CMP: Rs 1,444 TBO Tek was trading in a descending triangle pattern since June 30 but recently broke out above it. It has reclaimed its position above the 200-day EMA and is trading above all key short- and long-term moving averages. Volume is gradually increasing on the positive side, indicating growing buying interest. The daily RSI is at 63 and is maintaining its position above 50 levels, showing strong stock strength and suggesting that every small fall is countered with good buying interest. The rising MACD histogram supports continued bullish momentum. The stock exhibits relative strength and has outperformed the Nifty in the past 3 months. The immediate resistance is at Rs 1,508, and a breakout above this level could trigger a significant upward move. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,582, Rs 1,600 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,363 PB Fintech | CMP: Rs 1,834.2 PB Fintech was in a long consolidation phase after a bearish gap-down on January 13. On June 4, it broke above the consolidation pattern, filling the bearish gap between Rs 1,800–1,840. Subsequently, it marked a high of Rs 1,978, then entered a tight wedge consolidation. On August 11, the stock broke out above the wedge with strong volume, signaling robust buying interest. It is trading above all key moving averages, with the daily RSI above 50 and a rising MACD histogram, indicating sustained bullish momentum. The stock has shown good relative strength and has outperformed the Nifty over the last 6 months. The price can test the recent swing high of Rs 1,978, and sustaining above this level could open the path to higher levels. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1978, Rs 2,100, Rs 2,170 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,709 Hardik Matalia, Derivative Analyst at Choice Broking Eicher Motors | CMP: Rs 5,764 Eicher Motors has recently given a breakout from a Symmetric Triangle formation on the daily chart. Prior to this breakout, the stock had undergone a consolidation phase at higher levels, indicating healthy profit booking and base building. The breakout has been supported by consistent trading volumes, reflecting strong participation and growing investor confidence. If the stock manages to sustain above the Rs 5,800 level, it could pave the way for further upside, potentially leading to new lifetime highs. Such price action would confirm the continuation of the prevailing bullish trend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 66.14, trending strongly upwards, highlighting strengthening momentum and buying interest. Additionally, the stock is comfortably holding above all its key moving averages — short-term, medium-term, and long-term EMAs — underlining its strong underlying trend. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 6,350 Stop-Loss: Rs 5,475 HDFC Life Insurance Company | CMP: Rs 788.75 HDFC Life Insurance remains in a long-term uptrend, consistently forming higher highs and higher lows over the past few months. Recently, after hitting a record high, the stock witnessed a healthy retracement toward its demand zone. From this support area, it has staged a reversal, also forming a Double Bottom pattern on the daily timeframe — a classic bullish reversal formation. If the stock manages to sustain above the Rs 800 mark, it could further extend its bullish trajectory and head higher toward the Rs 875 level. Such a move would reinforce the prevailing trend and signal renewed buying momentum. The RSI stands at 65.46 and is trending upwards, highlighting strong positive momentum. Furthermore, the stock has reversed from its demand zone and has reclaimed both its short-term and medium-term EMAs, signaling a revival of buying interest. From a price action standpoint, the formation of a Double Bottom coupled with a rebound from key support levels suggests that buyers are firmly regaining control. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 875 Stop-Loss: Rs 745 State Bank of India | CMP: Rs 826.55 SBI has witnessed a bounce from lower levels after a period of range-bound movement. Recently, the stock has been trading within a parallel channel, indicating a phase of consolidation with defined support and resistance levels. Taking support from the lower boundary of this channel, the stock is now showing early signs of a potential reversal. A sustainable move above the Rs 840 mark could act as confirmation of this reversal, paving the way for further upside in the near term. Such a breakout would signal renewed bullish momentum and open the door for a move toward higher targets. The RSI is at 62.71, trending upwards, indicating improving strength in the underlying trend. Additionally, SBI has taken support from its long-term EMA and has successfully moved above both its short-term and medium-term EMAs, highlighting a strengthening technical structure. From a price action perspective, the channel support and EMA alignment suggest that buyers are gradually regaining control, with the current zone offering a favourable risk-reward setup. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 910 Stop-Loss: Rs 785 Om Mehra, Technical Research Analyst, SAMCO Securities Aditya Birla Capital | CMP: Rs 273 Aditya Birla Capital has rebounded from the 50-day SMA, while the 20-day SMA and the 9-DEMA are providing layered support beneath the current price. The recent candles reflect a higher high formation after the early August low, signalling a steady recovery. The RSI has improved to 55 from the neutral zone, indicating strengthening momentum. The MACD has crossed above the zero line, with the histogram turning positive, supporting the emerging bullish tone. There has been a decent rise in delivery-based participation, highlighting that the trend continuation is likely to remain intact. The price is now positioned above multiple moving averages, creating a strong base for a short-term pullback.

Small-caps rally: 25 stocks jump up to 54% as index breaks 3-week fall,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/small-caps-rally-25-stocks-jump-up-to-54-as-index-breaks-3-week-fall-13459445.html,"Indian markets broke the 6-week losing streak in the holiday-shortened week ended August 14. On the broader indices front, BSE mid and smallcap indices snapped the 3-week losing streak, while largecap indices also broke the 6-week losing streak following positive data points from the US and India, including CPI data, inline earnings, rupee appreciation, and falling oil prices. For the week, BSE Large-cap and Mid-cap indices added 1 percent each, and the BSE Small-cap index rose 0.4 percent. For the week, the BSE Sensex index added 739.87 points or 0.92 percent to close at 80,597.66, and Nifty50 rose 268 points or 1.10 percent to end at 24,631.30. The Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their selling in the 7th week, as they sold equities worth Rs 10,172.64 crore. On the other hand, Domestic Institutional Investors (DII) extended their buying in the 17th week, as they bought equities worth Rs 18,999.76 crore. On the other hand, Domestic Institutional Investors (DII) extended their buying in the 16th week, as they purchased equities worth Rs 33,608.66 crore. In this month of August so far, FII offloaded equities worth Rs 24,191.51 crore and DII purchased equities worth Rs 55,795.28 crore. On the sectoral front, Nifty Healthcare and Pharma indices rose 3.5 percent each, Nifty Auto index rose 2.7 percent, and Nifty PSU Bank index gained 2 percent. On the other hand, Nifty Consumer Durables and FMCG indices shed 0.5 percent each. ""In the last truncated week, the benchmark indices witnessed a pullback rally. The Nifty ended up by 1.1 percent, whereas the Sensex gained 748 points. Among sectors, almost all the major sectoral indices traded in positive territory, but the Pharma and Healthcare indices outperformed, both rallied over 3 percent. Meanwhile, profit booking was seen in selective FMCG and Consumer stocks,"" said Amol Athawale, VP Technical Research, Kotak Securities. ""Technically, on daily and intraday charts, the market has formed reversal patterns, which are largely positive. Additionally, a bullish candle was formed on the weekly charts, indicating the continuation of the pullback in the near future."" ""We believe that 24,500/80300 will act as a key support zone for short-term traders. As long as the market trades above this level, the bullish sentiment is likely to continue. On the higher side, 24,700/80900 would be the immediate resistance zone for the bulls. A successful breakout above 24,700/80900 could push the market towards 24,900-25,000/81500-81800,"" he said. ""However, below 24,500/80300, market sentiment could turn negative. The index could then retest levels around 24,350/79800. Further downside may also continue, potentially dragging the index to 24,200-24,150/79300-79100,"" Athawale added further. The BSE Small-cap index ended with o.4 percent gain, led by Yatra Online with a 55 percent gain, following HBL Engineering, NMDC Steel, JM Financial, Rico Auto, EIH, and VST Tillers Tractors. However, major losers losers PG Electroplast, NIBE, Camlin Fine Sciences, Best Agrolife, Marksans Pharma, and Action Construction Equipment. Where is Nifty50 headed? Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities Technically, the market action signals range-bound action and awaits a geopolitical event during the long weekend. Nifty on the weekly chart formed a reasonable positive candle that reversed the previous six losing weeks. Placement of cluster supports around 24300-24200 levels could offer strong support on any weakness from here. However, a sustainable upmove above the hurdle of 24700 could open further upside towards the 25,000 mark in the near term. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The overall sentiment is likely to favour bullish trades as long as the index holds above 24,337. On the higher side, resistance is placed at 24,660 and 24,850, while a fall below 24,337 could trigger a resumption of the bearish trend. Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking The prevailing consolidation suggests that markets have largely digested recent negatives and are now awaiting a trigger for recovery. Additionally, oversold positions in heavyweights across sectors are further supporting this possibility. Going forward, a decisive break above 24,800 on the Nifty could spark fresh momentum; otherwise, consolidation may persist. Participants should maintain a stock-specific trading approach with a focus on risk management.

"Greed & Fear: Chris Wood maintains only marginal overweight on India amid valuation, supply concerns",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/greed-fear-chris-wood-maintains-only-marginal-overweight-on-india-amid-valuation-supply-concerns-13459480.html,"Christopher Wood, global head of equity strategy at Jefferies and author of the closely tracked Greed & Fear report, said in his latest note that he is maintaining only a marginal overweight on India in the Asia Pacific ex-Japan relative-return portfolio. Wood noted that India, which has traditionally enjoyed a significant allocation in Greed & Fear portfolios, has suffered one of its steepest relative underperformances in 15 years. Citing Jefferies’ India research, he pointed out that the MSCI India index has lagged the MSCI Emerging Markets index by 24 percentage points over the past 12 months, and by 18 percentage points since mid-April. He attributed this underperformance primarily to high valuations and a flood of equity supply. “For India, the problem has been high valuations and, most importantly, massive equity supply,” Wood said. The Nifty is currently trading at 20.2 times one-year forward earnings — still above historical averages, though down from the 22.4x peak in October 2021. Monthly equity supply hit a record $10.4 billion in June, compared with an average of $7.3 billion in the second half of 2024. “Korea has ripped higher on the Value-Up theme, while Taiwan has been buoyed by hyperscaler-driven capex,” Wood added, highlighting how competing Asian markets have surged even as India stumbled. Despite the cautious stance, Jefferies’ India report points out that Indian markets have often bounced back strongly after such phases of relative weakness. “Following previous such periods of underperformance, the Indian market tends to bounce on a relative basis,” Wood noted. Current valuations, trading at the 10-year average premium of 63 percent over emerging-market peers, may also suggest that the downside is already priced in. Domestic flows are providing further resilience. Equity mutual fund inflows nearly doubled in July to $6.4 billion, the highest since October 2024, while broader domestic inflows (including non-mutual fund investors) averaged $7.2 billion per month in the first seven months of 2025, compared with just $2.4 billion in 2023. On the policy front, the Reserve Bank of India has already cut rates by 100 basis points this year and maintained a dovish stance in its latest meeting, though the rupee has weakened 4.2% against the dollar since May. Wood also downplayed the risk from the proposed 50 percent US tariff, calling it more of a buying opportunity. “Rather, it is probably a reason to buy them, since Greed & Fear’s view is that it is only a matter of time before Washington backs off the stance, which is not in America’s interest,” he said.","Current valuations, trading at the 10-year average premium of 63 percent over emerging-market peers, may also suggest that the downside is already priced in.","Citing Jefferies’ India research, he pointed out that the MSCI India index has lagged the MSCI Emerging Markets index by 24 percentage points over the past 12 months, and by 18 percentage points since mid-April.","Despite the cautious stance, Jefferies’ India report points out that Indian markets have often bounced back strongly after such phases of relative weakness.","On the policy front, the Reserve Bank of India has already cut rates by 100 basis points this year and maintained a dovish stance in its latest meeting, though the rupee has weakened 4.2% against the dollar since May."

Mutual funds are pushing for non-disclosure of block deals as Sebi reviews framework,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/mutual-funds-are-pushing-for-non-disclosure-of-block-deals-as-sebi-reviews-framework-13456287.html,"Should the names of parties involved in block deals be made public? The question came up during a review of the block deal framework by a Sebi-appointed working group, where mutual fund representatives pushed for change, arguing that the disclosure does not serve any significant purpose, and may even be detrimental for liquidity in that scrip. One fund manager suggested to the working group, “If an investor’s allocation across schemes results in a stake of less than 0.50% of a company’s total issued capital, the requirement to publicly disclose their name in block deal data should be done away with.” Another fund manager said disclosing names in block deals can hurt market liquidity. “Often, once names are disclosed, other market participants follow the trade trend, which impacts both the price and supply of the scrip. In many cases, the intended transaction cannot be completed in a single block deal, and multiple deals are required. But once the news is out, the price moves, derailing the strategy.” One of the fund managers pointed out that institutional investors often have investment timelines and strategies entirely different from retail investors, and said, “These small, scheme-level transactions rarely carry significant influence over the company but still require the same level of disclosure, adding to compliance burdens without much benefit.” Also Read: Inside stock market’s VIP lounge: How Sebi plans to stop the gatecrashers However, some market participants disagree. Arun Kejriwal, Founder of Kejriwal Research and Investment Services said Sebi should not entertain such suggestions. “The block deal disclosure framework has existed for many years, it has worked well, and it should continue for the sake of transparency,” said Arun Kejriwal. The BSE Brokers Forum (BBF), an association part of the working group to review block deal framework also voiced strong reservations. BBF argued that the block deal window comes with privileges – like negotiated pricing and reduced market impact - that justify greater transparency. “The public dissemination of data serves the larger interest of the market,” said one BBF representative, adding, “If participants are uncomfortable with having their names in the public domain, they can always trade in the normal market instead of using the block window.” The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has yet to decide on these suggestions and is reviewing the block deal framework. The working group has proposed several changes, reported earlier by Moneycontrol, including expanding the price band to 5 percent for the morning window and 3 percent for the afternoon window. Another suggestion is to increase the minimum deal size threshold to Rs 25 crore from current Rs 10 crore. The rationale for higher block size is that benchmark indices have grown nearly 2.7 times over the last 10 years, and with the growth in size and depth of the market, it is natural to raise the current limit, which was set in 2017. There is also a view that raising the block size limit would ensure participation from serious institutional investors, and not high-net worth individuals or family offices, who bypass the main market via block deals. Another suggestion to the working group was the need for a unified reference price for both windows. Currently, the morning window’s reference price (8:45–9:00 am) is based on the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) of the last half hour of the previous trading session, while the afternoon window’s reference price (2:05–2:20 pm) is based on the VWAP of trades executed between 1:45 pm and 2:00 pm. Block deals are primarily used by institutional investors such as mutual funds and insurance companies to execute large trades without significantly disturbing market prices. These pre-negotiated deals are executed in specific trading windows under strict rules to prevent price manipulation.",Another suggestion to the working group was the need for a unified reference price for both windows.,"“The public dissemination of data serves the larger interest of the market,” said one BBF representative, adding, “If participants are uncomfortable with having their names in the public domain, they can always trade in the normal market instead of using the block window.” The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has yet to decide on these suggestions and is reviewing the block deal framework.",Block deals are primarily used by institutional investors such as mutual funds and insurance companies to execute large trades without significantly disturbing market prices.,"“The public dissemination of data serves the larger interest of the market,” said one BBF representative, adding, “If participants are uncomfortable with having their names in the public domain, they can always trade in the normal market instead of using the block window.” The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has yet to decide on these suggestions and is reviewing the block deal framework."

NIM decline was arrested at 10bps QoQ (even lower adjusted for IT refund); SBI expects a healthy pull back in H2FY26. CA growth surged further YoY. Despite subdued growth in Xpress credit, overall RAM growth sustained at ~14% YoY led by SME/home loans at 19%/15% YoY. Fee growth was strong at 10% YoY which, along with treasury gains, led to a healthy RoA print of 1.14%. Net NPA was stable at 47bps. Seasonality drove slippages higher QoQ, but improved YoY. We bake in the recent INR 250bn capital raise. We revise our FY26E/27E EPS upwards by 5-6% each and expect strong RoA of 1% for both years. Outlook Retain BUY; TP revised to INR 970. We argue that treasury gains for SBI appear recurring and less risky. Despite sluggish growth in Xpress credit, SBI has delivered superior growth in overall retail loans suggesting improved execution.

Buy Bajaj Consumer Care; target of Rs 300: ICICI Securities,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/buy-bajaj-consumer-care-target-of-rs-300-icici-securities-13455841.html,"ICICI Securities's research report on Bajaj Consumer Care Bajaj Consumer (BaCo) posted a muted Q1FY26 performance, with revenue up 7.4% YoY (+3.7% ex-Banjara’s acquisition) led by 4% value growth in Almond Drops Hair Oil (ADHO) and flat volumes. In our view, the renewed focus on ADHO to drive volume growth (in price-pointed packs) and step-up in A&P spends (ADHO media spends +46% YoY) should improve the volume and margin performance. Non-ADHO portfolio had a soft quarter due to product portfolio rationalisation, partially offset by 20%+ growth in Bajaj Coconut oil. Lower commodity prices and a better mix drove margin expansion, which is likely to continue. Project Aarohan Phase 2 rollout across key Hindi-speaking markets, strategic changes following the management transition, and the successful integration of Vishal Personal Care (Banjara’s) remain key execution levers in the near term. Maintain BUY. Outlook We maintain our earnings estimates; modelling revenue / EBITDA / PAT CAGR of 8% / 17% / 17% over FY25-27E, respectively. Maintain BUY with a DCF-based target price of INR 300. At our target price, the stock will trade at 24x P/E Mar’27E. Downside risks: Over reliance on a single brand – ADHO and higher-than-expect commodity inflation and failure of new product launches.

Revenues stood at INR 34bn, EBITDA came in at INR 4.3bn (+23% YoY) and margins swelled 170bps YoY to 12.9%. Thus, PAT surged 50% YoY to INR 1.3bn. Earnings for the quarter looked steady on the back of healthier margins; though, execution should pick up from H2FY26. It has an order book (OB) of INR 353bn and is L1 in projects worth INR 215bn (includes recently won projects in Croatia). It would be crucial for Afcons to convert these into LoAs (start of execution) to help earnings visibility. Of these L1s, we see execution for projects worth ~INR 170bn starting in H2FY26 – aiding execution pick up. Order pipeline is healthy at INR 3.3trn (INR 2.2trn domestic). Given the strong OB (incl. L1s), visibility on execution pick up and strong order pipeline, Afcons should meet its FY26 guidance. Retain BUY with a TP of INR 496. Outlook On balance, we maintain our BUY rating on the stock with a TP of INR 496.

For H1 CY25, revenue grew by 9.3% to Rs. 125,843 million. The decline in Q2 was primarily due to a 3% drop in consolidated sales volume, which stood at 389 million cases. In India, volumes were impacted by abnormally high and unseasonal rainfall all through the quarter, resulting in a 7.1% decline in India. However, this was partially offset by healthy growth in international markets where volumes grew 15.1% led by a growth of 16.1% in South Africa. Net realization per case at the consolidated level improved marginally by 0.% supported by a favorable mix in the international markets per case realization recorded a 6.6% increase. CSD accounted for 75% of the total volumes in Q2 CY25 with packaged drinking water contributing 18% and NCB making up the remaining 7%. EBITDA remained flat at Rs. 19,988 million from Rs. 19,912 million in Q2 CY24. EBITDA margin improving by 82 basis points YoY to 28.5% in Q2 CY25, driven by operational efficiencies and a strong currency in international operations.

"Gold loan NBFC Muthoot Finance says will 'better' the full-year growth guidance, shares at record high",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/gold-loan-nbfc-muthoot-finance-shares-at-record-high-as-lender-confident-of-improving-full-year-growth-guidance-13455499.html,"Gold loan NBFC Muthoot Finance is confident of improving its loan growth guidance this year, currently projected at 15 percent, which the lender said will be reviewed after the second quarter and will likely be raised. Speaking to CNBC-TV18 on August 14 following the June quarter results, George Alexander Muthoot, Managing Director of Muthoot Finance said, ""We had said 15 percent but we will better it. We don't want to change right now, but it will be better than 15 percent. Let us not limit to 20 percent, it could be even better, we will discuss in the next quarter,"" Muthoot said, when asked the view on loan growth guidance. Read More: Muthoot Finance shares hit 10% upper circuit on Q1 beat: Should you buy, sell, or hold? The NBFC cited three key factors behind the strong quarterly show, which are, a healthy demand for gold loans, strong momentum in gold prices, and recent lending guidelines by RBI that were seen as business friendly by the industry. George Alexander Muthoot said the final guidelines gave a boost to the gold loan business, conveying a message that the Finance Ministry and the RBI is keen to support the gold loan business, as it serves the community well. The lender said the worst for the gold loan business may be behind and all players have started lending responsibly. Muthoot Finance added that it is facing no issues in accessing capital from banks. The demand has been healthy as gold loan borrowers have had limited access to unsecured loans, Muthoot added. The NBFC said it will aim to maintain the spread at 9.5 percent, and will pass on the benefits of lower borrowing rates to customers as banks start cutting MCLR. Jefferies has maintained a Buy call on Muthoot Finance, raising target to Rs 2,950 per share. The NBFC's June quarter profit growth was stronger than expected, and credit cost along with NPAs fell compared to March quarter. The note added that strong growth in gold prices and the headroom to further raise its LTV should support healthy loan growth for Muthoot Finance. Morgan Stanley has upgraded the stock to Overweight with a target price of Rs 2,920 per share, backed by strong ROE and EPS growth, along with an negligible asset quality risk, even amid the risk of rising bad loans at the group level, the note added.

Even so, Voltas maintains its leadership in the RAC segment. Takeaways: (1) The company refrained from price cuts/discounting for market share gains. (2) Softer demand for RAC led to lower capacity utilisation at its Chennai plant, impacting margins. (3) Voltas Beko (VoltBek) continued to gain market share aided by operational efficiencies, multi-channel traction and improved retail visibility. (4) The company continues to expand its non-seasonal portfolio to reduce seasonality risk. We believe, the company could benefit from NPD (AI-enabled series in RAC), cost discipline and the upcoming festive demand; however, elevated summer inventory in the channels may cap rest of FY26. We downgrade the stock as we model relatively weaker FY26. Outlook We trim our FY26–27E earnings estimate by 7.0%–14.7% to factor in the weak Q1FY26 results.

"NSDL shares extend losses to second day on Q1 results, drop 18% after 62% post-listing rally",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/nsdl-shares-extend-losses-to-second-day-on-q1-results-drop-18-after-62-post-listing-rally-13455222.html,"The shares of National Securities Depository (NSDL) dropped nearly 4 percent on August 14, extending losses for the second consecutive session after the release of its Q1 results. The newly-listed stock has now fallen nearly 18 percent from its record high level in just three sessions. After opening flat, NSDL shares dropped nearly 4 percent to hit an intraday low of Rs 1,161 apiece. Yesterday, the stock dropped more than 6 percent to close at Rs 1,206 apiece. This came after the company released its results for the April-June quarter of the financial year 2026. NSDL on August 12 reported a net profit of Rs 89.63 crore for the first quarter of the financial year 2026. This marks a rise of more than 15 percent on-year from the Rs 77.82 crore reported by the newly-listed company for the same quarter last year. While the firm saw a rise in its bottom line, its expenses dropped more than 14 percent on-year to Rs 228 crore in April-June quarter of the ongoing financial year. The firm's revenue from operations however dropped 7.5 percent on-year to Rs 312 crore in Q1 FY26. Its revenue from operations stood at Rs 337 crore in Q1 FY25. Sequentially, it fell more than 14 percent from the Rs 364 crore revenue reported in Q4 FY25. NSDL shares had made a decent stock market debut on August 6, listing at 10 percent premium to IPO price at Rs 880 apiece on BSE. Analysts had advised investors to consider holding the stock for the long term, given NSDL’s strong fundamentals and leadership in the depository segment. The Rs 4,000-crore IPO had turned out to be a multi-bagger for some of India’s top financial institutions. The shares of the company rallied as much as 62 percent from its listing price, and over 78 percent from its IPO price during the sharp rally, to hit an all-time high level of Rs 1,425 per share in just four sessions.

""Post Q1FY26 result, NSDL's stock price experienced a notable correction following an exceptional initial rally after its IPO. Net profit rose 15.1% YoY to ₹90 crore, however, revenue fell 7.5% YoY to ₹312 crore and over 14% sequentially, likely due to softer capital market activity. NSDL trades at a premium PE ratio of around 72, compared to peers like CDSL at about 66, sustaining this premium will depend on consistent revenue growth in the coming quarters. For long-term investors, NSDL’s dominant position, high switching costs, and regulatory tailwinds support the story, but near-term topline softness needs monitoring,"" said Ajit Mishra, SVP, Research, Religare Broking Ltd. ""Long-term investors can take comfort in the fact that India's capital market infrastructure fundamentals remain robust, which indirectly optimizes real estate sentiment as liquidity confidence gets bolstered...Non-allotted investors can consider buying on dips with a horizon of 2–3 years. The listing confirms the wider demand for reliable, regulated market participants – and a welcome boost for allied industries such as housing finance and commercial property,"" said Siddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director, Vibhavangal Anukulakara Private Limited. NSDL’s current P/E ratio currently stands at around 71.5, significantly higher than the 49 P/E ratio recorded during its debut. Its peer CDSL currently has a P/E ratio of around 66. The valuation may appear to be stretched when compared to that of CDSL, investors are clearly willing to pay a premium for NSDL’s scale, technology backbone, and long-standing trust within the ecosystem, said Bhavik Joshi, Business Head at INVasset PMS. ""That said, prospective investors should be mindful of certain structural risks — dependence on transaction volumes, evolving investor participation patterns, and the ever-present cybersecurity and regulatory compliance requirements. In the near term, valuations may moderate if market activity slows, offering potential entry points for those who missed the IPO,” Joshi added. Also read: NSDL shares see volatility after rally; what lies ahead? Nitin Jain, Senior Research Analyst at Bonanza, said it is recommended for short-term and listing-gain-focused investors to book some profits. ""The near-term upside may be capped after such a sharp move, and markets tend to see consolidation post a robust debut. If you are a long-term investor willing to ride out near-term volatility, NSDL remains a high-quality stock supported by rising demat penetration,"" he added. Market expert Ambareesh Baliga told CNBC-TV18 that it will be ideal for IPO investors to book profits at current levels and make a shift back to CDSL. ""At the IPO price, NSDL was definitely cheaper compared to CSDL but now it is expensive after the recent run-up. I think along with long investors shifting from CDSL to NSDL post listing, we have seen huge number of momentum trader getting in, which has pushed the stock higher,"" he said. Sunny Agarwal of SBI Securities also told the news channel that investors focused on short-term gains should book profits after the record rally, while long term investors should consider accumulating more shares using any dip.
