Sebi proposes transmission of securities from nominee to heirs without tax tangle,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sebi-proposes-transmission-of-securities-from-nominee-to-heirs-without-tax-tangle-13446913.html,"Market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has proposed tweaking regulations to make the transmission of securities from nominees to legal heirs easier and smoother, while avoiding unnecessary tax-related complications. In its draft circular, Sebi said that a nominee who acts as a trustee of the securities of the original holder may be assessed for tax when transmitting these securities to the legal heir, despite provisions under the Income Tax Act that do not consider such transmission a “transfer.” Sebi noted that payment of capital gains tax by the nominee in such cases may not be appropriate, given that the securities ultimately belong to the legal heir and are merely being transmitted by the nominee. To streamline the process and resolve unintended taxation issues, Sebi has proposed that a standard reason code — “TLH” — be used by reporting entities when reporting the transmission of securities from nominee to legal heir to the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT). This would help ensure proper application of the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961. Also read: Sebi buying the cool tool for faster investigations To examine these complexities, Sebi had formed a working group of Registrars to an Issue and Share Transfer Agents, which held discussions with various stakeholders. Based on these consultations, the group recommended using the “TLH” code for such transactions when reporting to the CBDT. The draft circular states: “In view of the above, RTAs, listed issuers, depositories and depository participants are directed to take note of the above and make necessary system changes for implementation of this proposal within three months of the issuance of this circular.” In recent years, Sebi has issued several circulars and frameworks to streamline the process of appointing nominees and transferring securities. The regulator has now invited comments and suggestions from stakeholders by September 2, 2025.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade TBO Tek, CreditAccess Grameen, MCX, Maruti Suzuki, Acutaas Chemicals, Max Financial, and others on August 13?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-tbo-tek-creditaccess-grameen-mcx-maruti-suzuki-acutaas-chemicals-max-financial-and-others-on-august-13-13446707.html,"The benchmark indices failed to extend the previous day's rally further due to profit-taking, with the Nifty 50 ending the session with a 98-point loss on August 12. The market breadth was largely equal, with about 1,392 shares declining against 1,306 advancing shares on the NSE. The index is expected to consolidate until it decisively breaks the previous week's range on either side for a firm direction. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors TBO Tek | CMP: Rs 1,445.4 On the daily chart, TBO Tek is currently trading in a rectangular range of Rs 1,310 to Rs 1,460 levels since May 2025, which indicates accumulation. As of now, prices are on the verge of a breakout from the said consolidation, and a break above the upper end of the range, i.e., near Rs 1,460 levels, can trigger a fresh course of rally in the stock. Along with this, the 50-period EMA (Exponential Moving Average) and 100-period EMA have recently witnessed a bullish crossover, which further reinforces the positive outlook for the stock. For now, a break above Rs 1,460 levels can start a fresh move on the upside towards Rs 1,520, followed by Rs 1,560 levels. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,520, Rs 1,560 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,400 CreditAccess Grameen | CMP: Rs 1,301.9 On the daily chart, CreditAccess Grameen has been moving in accordance with its upward-sloping trendline since March 2025, which has proven to act as a prudent support previously. On August 7, prices found support at this level, which is also an Ichimoku cloud support, and we saw a sharp reversal on the upside of more than 9%, which is a sign of strength in the ongoing trend. Moreover, since then, prices have consistently managed to protect their prior day’s low on a closing basis, which keeps the overall daily bias on the side of the bulls. As of now, a decisive break above the baseline (red) of the Ichimoku cloud indicator can further boost positive momentum towards its previous swing high of Rs 1,400 levels. The current trend for CreditAccess Grameen has shifted to the side of the bulls. For now, a break above Rs 1,310 levels can lift the prices higher towards Rs 1,360, followed by Rs 1,400 levels. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,360, Rs 1,400 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,260 Multi Commodity Exchange of India | CMP: Rs 8,151.5 On the daily chart, MCX has been moving within its downward-sloping channel since July 2025. In the previous session, prices gave a decisive break above the said channel, which highlights that bulls have started to get active in the stock. As of now, prices have managed to retrace 38.2% of the fall that started in July 2025, and now, with follow-up buying, prices can retrace up to 50% of the fall, which comes near Rs 8,350 levels. Moreover, MACD has just witnessed a bullish crossover, which acts as a double confirmation for our stance. MCX has just witnessed a breakout. For now, a break above Rs 8,230 levels is a must for this trending move to continue towards Rs 8,475, followed by Rs 8,720 levels. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 8,475, Rs 8,720 Stop-Loss: Rs 7,985 Amol Athawale, VP Technical Research at Kotak Securities HCL Technologies | CMP: Rs 1,499.1 Post its declining trend, HCL Technologies reversed from its important support zone. The stock has formed a rounding bottom chart pattern on the daily scale, and it is in a steady up move. The technical indicator like RSI is also indicating further uptrend from current levels, which could boost the bullish momentum in the coming horizon. As long as the stock is trading above Rs 1,440, the bullish texture is likely to continue, above which, the counter could move up to Rs 1,600. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,600 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,440 Maruti Suzuki India | CMP: Rs 12,840 On the daily charts, Maruti Suzuki was trading in a rangebound mode for the past many sessions. However, it has given a range breakout along with good volumes. In addition, the counter has formed a higher bottom series, signifying bullishness. Therefore, the closing above the resistance line indicates further bullish momentum to continue from the current levels. For the next few trading sessions, Rs 12,400 could be the trend-decider level for the bulls. If it sustains above the same, we can expect a further uptrend towards Rs 13,750. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 13,750 Stop-Loss: Rs 12,400 Canara Bank | CMP: Rs 109.55 Post decline from the higher levels, Canara Bank rebounded from its demand zone and witnessed a steady recovery from the lower levels. Additionally, on the daily charts, the counter has formed a higher low formation. Therefore, the gradual up moves in the counter suggest a new leg of the bullish trend from the current levels. For traders, Rs 104 would be the key support level to watch out for, above which the uptrend structure could continue towards Rs 117. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 117 Stop-Loss: Rs 104 Nandish Shah, Senior Technical and Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities Acutaas Chemicals | CMP: Rs 1,304 Acutaas Chemicals has broken out on the weekly chart with higher volumes. The stock price has been forming a bullish higher top–higher bottom formation on the weekly and monthly charts. Accumulation has been seen in the stock, where up-day volumes are higher as compared to down days during the last few weeks. Momentum indicators and oscillators like RSI and MFI are in a rising mode and placed above 60 on the daily chart, suggesting strength in the current bullish trend. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,380, Rs 1,425 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,240 Bank of India | CMP: Rs 113.51 The short-term trend of Bank of India remains positive as it is placed above its 11- and 20-day EMA. The primary trend turned positive as the stock price closed above its 200-day EMA. Accumulation has been seen in Bank of India as up-day volumes are higher as compared to down days during the last few days. Momentum indicators and oscillators are showing strength in the current uptrend of the stock. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 119, Rs 124 Stop-Loss: Rs 109 Max Financial Services | CMP: Rs 1,588.4 MFSL has broken out on the daily chart from the downward-sloping trendline, adjoining highs of July 1 and July 22, 2025.

Momentum indicators and oscillators like RSI and MFI are in a rising mode and placed above 60 on the daily chart, suggesting strength in the current bullish trend.

The investment is geared toward supporting innovators from early development through late-phase clinical supply, enhancing NJ Bio's cGMP bioconjugation capabilities to supply full Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs) up to Phase 2b clinical studies. The expansion aims to strengthen the integrated offering in ADCs, combining payload-linker synthesis and bioconjugation. NJ Bio is currently executing a major program for an existing innovator customer with multiple ADC candidates, supporting Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies. The new suite will have the flexibility to manufacture up to 2 kg of ADCs, designed to handle high-potent drug substances, for clinical requirements. The facility is expected to be operational by the end of Q4FY26, with bioconjugation work commencing thereafter. Vivek Sharma, Executive Chairman of Cohance Lifesciences, noted the investment as a pivotal milestone in the ADC space. Cohance Lifesciences, formerly Suven Pharmaceuticals, reported revenue of INR 26 billion (~USD 313 million) with 33.6% adjusted EBITDA margins in FY25. NJ Bio is in discussions with three to four additional customers whose ADC programs are expected to transition to cGMP manufacturing upon commissioning of the expanded suite. NJ Bio has expanded its linker-payload capabilities with a dedicated lab, completing one GMP campaign with two more underway. The global ADC market is experiencing growth due to rising cancer incidence. NJ Bio's single-site CRDMO model aligns with the preference for seamless, end-to-end execution.

Click to View More Outlook for August 13 Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities The selling pressure has emerged from the highs on Tuesday, after a stellar upmove of Monday and Nifty closed the day lower by 97 points. After opening with a positive note the market surged higher in the early-mid part of the session. However, sharp weakness got triggered from the day's high of 24700 and the market remained weak in the mid to later part of the session. A small red candle was formed on the daily chart with long upper shadow. Technically, this market action indicates a lack of strong upside momentum to surpass the overhead hurdle. The bulls may hold the ground as long as the base of 24300 is protected. The short term uptrend that resumed after a sharp upmove of Monday remains intact and we expect buying to emerge from near the supports of 24300-24400 levels in the coming sessions. Hence, one may expect Nifty to retest the crucial hurdle of around 24700 in the short term. Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets failed to build on Monday’s gains and ended nearly half a percent lower amid volatility. The session started on a positive note, but noticeable pressure in heavyweights, particularly banking and financial stocks, not only erased the early gains but also dragged the index into negative territory. Eventually, the Nifty settled near the day’s low at 24,487.40 levels. On the sectoral front, the trend was mixed—pharma, auto, and IT ended higher, while banking and financials emerged as the top losers. The broader indices also traded mixed, with market breadth closing flat. This decline reflects a lack of conviction among participants amid mixed cues, and the bias is likely to turn positive only if the Nifty decisively sustains above 24,600, its 100 DEMA. Meanwhile, select stocks across sectors are showing notable strength on the back of strong earnings and upbeat prospects. Participants should focus on these outperformers and avoid laggards while anticipating a rebound. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities Nifty faced selling pressure as uncertainties surrounding tariffs and geopolitical issues continued to weigh on Indian equities. The index slipped from the day’s high of 24,700, closing more than 200 points lower. In the short term, the index is likely to remain volatile with no clear directional bias. On the downside, immediate support is placed at 24,450; a break below this level could drag it towards 24,337 or lower. On the upside, immediate resistance is seen at 24,660–24,700, and a sustained move above this zone could push it towards 24,850 or even 25,000.

Revenue dipped ~20% YoY to INR39.4b (-10% vs. estimate), due to ~25%/16%/3% YoY decline in UCP/PES/EMPS revenue. EBITDA declined ~58% YoY to INR1.8b (~43% miss, led by lower-than-estimated revenue/margin in the UCP segment). OPM contracted 4.1pp YoY to 4.5% (2.7pp below our estimate). PAT declined ~58% YoY to INR1.4b (~42% miss) for the quarter. Management highlighted that 1QFY26 was a challenging period as growth momentum turned adverse in May’25. The weak summer season led to a significant drop in peak season demand for ACs and other cooling products. VOLT believes the performance dip in 1QFY26 was temporary, and it is taking corrective actions, including cost-control measures, inventory realignment, and production adjustments.

The tender document suggests that, “The tool should simplify complex analysis, provide actionable intelligence, allow sharing data among multiple users for accelerated investigations, maintain forensic record and integrity of digital evidences."" The tender document further said: “The solution should offer centralized data management capabilities to reduce risk and optimise storage needs. The solution should have advanced digital analysis capabilities in order to enable interactive search and filter options, different views of selected data, network visualization and in-depth event detail analysis”. The technical requirements listed include allowing uploading and analysis of at least 500 or more extractions at any point of time. Also, it should have the capacity to allow 20 or more users simultaneously. There should be no limitations on total size of data uploaded, stored and analysed by the solution during the contract period.

Sebi then analyses the data, communication from such devices and makes a case against such entities after investigation. Sebi currently uses various such software to analyse bank accounts, email communication, chats etc from data dumps of devices. Sebi is now expecting that with new tool, it will be able to analyse data much faster and also give actionable intelligence. During searches Sebi teams comprises of forensic experts who quickly download data from digital devices and there after its returned to the owners of such devices. Then, it takes around months to analyse the data, connect the dots and make a case against persons and entities.","The tender document suggests that, “The tool should simplify complex analysis, provide actionable intelligence, allow sharing data among multiple users for accelerated investigations, maintain forensic record and integrity of digital evidences.""",It further said that there shall be no limitation on number of users created for access control and no limitation on number of cases created for access control.,"Sebi is now expecting that with new tool, it will be able to analyse data much faster and also give actionable intelligence.","The regulator has short listed three firms based on technical parameters, including L&T Technology Services, Pelorus Technologies Pvt Lt and Starlight Data Solutions Pvt Ltd.

We believe GRMs will rebound to the long-term average of USD5-7/bbl in FY26/27 and build in a GRM of USD6/7/bbl for FY26/27E. On the marketing front, we build in a GMM of Rs4.4/4.5/4.9/lit for FY25/26/27E. The company has reduced its debt from Rs633bn in FY25-end to Rs510bn in the quarter.

RM costs increased led by an inch up in caustic soda prices, while other expenses were elevated on account of RPO obligation compliance costs and higher repairs/ coal transportation costs, leading to below estimate EBITDA delivery. Mgmt. reiterated FY26 alumina sales guidance at ~1.28mt, supported by higher refinery output and increased export shipments. Ongoing 1mtpa refinery expansion is expected to commence operations by Jun’25 now and mgmt. is targeting incremental 0.5mt/1mt alumina in FY27/28E supported by Pottangi bauxite mine. Captive coal mines are ramping up well and expected to cater to ~56% of coal requirements at full capacity in FY26. NACL is also looking to expand its value-added business, which, along with other cost-saving initiatives, will support margins.

We believe Plywood will continue to see healthy volume growth and better realizations as the company took a price hike of 2% in Q1FY26. Also the company highlighted during the call that Jul’25 saw the highest volume growth in its history, and improvement in Laminate and MDF segments. Outlook We expect overall revenue/EBITDA/PAT CAGR of 13.2%/26.1%/47.8% with Plywood/Laminate/MDF/Particleboard volume CAGR of 11.1%/14.0%/19.0%/15.6% over FY25-27E.

Carborundum Universal (CU) reported a modest 1.9% YoY increase in consolidated sales, while EBITDA margin contracted by 622 bps YoY to 9.9%, weighed down by weaker subsidiary profitability. In the Abrasives segment, logistics-related disruptions at Rhodius and softer demand across distribution channels due to inventory correction, impacted performance. Conversely, the Ceramics segment benefited from improved volumes and pricing in Industrial and Metallized ceramics. Standalone Electrominerals witnessed healthy demand from both domestic and export markets; however, consolidated profitability remained under pressure due to sanctions on VAW, leading to a ~25% volume decline. Given the prevailing near-term headwinds, management has downward revised its FY26 consolidated revenue growth guidance to 5.5–6.5% YoY. Outlook We maintain ‘Hold’ rating with a SoTP-based revised TP of Rs835 (Rs1,028 earlier) valuing Abrasives/Ceramics/Electrominerals at 30x/35x/15x Mar’27E (32x/40x/20x Mar’27E earlier).

The management has reiterated its guidance for 20–25% revenue growth in FY26, supported by a robust tendering pipeline of ~Rs1.2trn in the T&D segment over the next 12–18 months. The B&F segment continues to deliver strong performance, aided by significant order wins, despite persistent labor constraints. In the O&G segment, execution ramp-up of the large Saudi Aramco order is expected to act as a key growth catalyst. The Water segment, however, remains affected by collection delays. For FY26, the management anticipates total order intake of Rs260–280bn, ensuring healthy multi-year revenue visibility. Balance sheet strength is also expected to improve, driven by debt reduction and targeted reduction in NWC days to below 100. Outlook We revise our FY26/FY27E EPS estimates by +3.2%/+1.0% factoring in strong execution momentum in the T&D segment.

A breakthrough that paves the way for ending the Russia–Ukraine war could dramatically lift sentiment, rendering the 25 percent penal tariff on India’s Russian oil imports irrelevant. However, given Trump’s unpredictable stance and his reported displeasure with India’s response, the outcome remains uncertain, says V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments Ltd said. ""Meanwhile, the extension of China–US trade talks by another 90 days underscores Beijing’s negotiating leverage, particularly through its dominance in the rare earth magnet market. On the domestic front, robust equity inflows into mutual funds — Rs 42,702 crore in July — highlight retail investors’ optimism.

Among movers, PG Electroplast shares gained 2 percent on Tuesday after a 36 percent plunge in the previous session, triggered by cuts to FY26 guidance and promoter selling. The company now projects 17–19 percent revenue growth, down from 30.3 percent, and has lowered its net profit target to Rs 300–310 crore from Rs 405 crore. Capex plans have also been trimmed to Rs 700–750 crore from Rs 800–900 crore. The correction drew some long-term investors looking to buy at lower valuations.

This price action formed a bullish candlestick pattern, indicating sustained buying interest and upward momentum. Technically, a decisive move above 24,650 could open the door for an upside toward 24,850, while immediate support lies at 24,500 and 24,330 — both seen as attractive zones for fresh long positions,"" Amruta Shinde, Technical & Derivative Analyst at Choice Equity Broking, said. ""The Bank Nifty also saw a sharp intraday reversal of nearly 580 points, forming a strong bullish candle that reflected continued buying at lower levels. It found firm support near the 20-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA), with key supports now placed at 55,320 and 55,000. Resistance is seen in the 55,700–56,000 range, and a convincing breakout above this zone could lead to a rally toward the psychological 56,200 mark,"" she added.

The loan book grew by 9.0% YoY to Rs. 38,773 cr. The client base now stands at 2.83 lakh. Net interest income grew by 12.9% YoY to Rs. 349 cr. The net interest margin (NIM) edged moderately lower to 3.6% compared to last quarter.

It is expected to normalize to around 18% in FY26 and 19% in FY27 with IT costs factored in. PAT grew modestly by 12.1% YoY to Rs. 224 cr in Q1FY26, despite an uptick in provisions. The increase in provisioning was a deliberate and tactical move by the management, aimed at cleaning up sticky accounts early in the fiscal year. Asset quality experienced slight deterioration, with GNPA/NNPA rising to 0.98%/0.54% from 0.91%/0.49% in Q1FY25. The Provision Coverage Ratio (PCR) also declined to 45.2% from 46.5% in Q1FY25. Outlook As the benefit of the rate cut is transmitted only after it has been experienced by the bank, the NIM is expected to remain stable. The bank has guided for a credit cost of 15 bps for FY26, anticipating that asset quality will remain within a stable range. ROA and ROE are projected to remain largely stable at 2.1% and 16.6%, respectively, over FY26– 27. Therefore, we assign a BUY rating with a revised target price of Rs. 900, based on 1.8x FY27E BVPS.

(NSDL) swung sharply on Tuesday, August 12 — rising up to 5 percent in early trade before paring almost all gains — as investors awaited the depository’s first quarterly results since its market debut, amid a broader decline in Indian equities. The stock had a volatile start to the week. On Monday, it briefly touched an intraday high of Rs 1,425, nearly 80 percent above its IPO price of Rs 800, before giving up gains and ending the session over 12 percent lower from the day’s peak. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Rival Central Depository Services (India) Ltd. (CDSL) recently reported a 15.3 percent sequential rise in revenue and an improvement in margins for the June quarter. However, the number of new demat accounts opened during the period dropped 11 percent both sequentially and year-on-year, even as demat custody value grew compared to the previous quarter. Since listing, NSDL shares have rallied sharply, pushing valuations above those of CDSL — a reversal from the discount they traded at prior to debut. The company entered the market on August 6 at Rs 880 on the BSE, a 10 percent premium to its issue price. The debut premium was lower than grey market expectations, though analysts have largely maintained a long-term bullish view on the stock, citing NSDL’s dominant position in the depository business.

So far in 2025, the stock has declined 12 percent, underperforming the benchmark Nifty 50’s 2 percent rise over the same period. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog For the quarter ended June 2025, SJVN’s consolidated net profit fell 36.2 percent year-on-year to Rs 227.8 crore. This decline came despite growth in revenue and an improvement in profit margins. Revenue from operations increased 5.4 percent to Rs 917.5 crore from Rs 870.4 crore in the same period last year, while operating profit (EBITDA) rose 11.2 percent to Rs 742.4 crore. Operating margin improved to 80.9 percent from 76.7 percent in Q1FY25, supported by higher efficiency in the generation business. The renewable energy segment, which includes wind and solar power, contributed Rs 115.62 crore to revenue in Q1FY26, more than doubling from Rs 55.83 crore a year earlier. Revenue from power trading, however, fell to Rs 0.78 crore from Rs 1.94 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. Other income during the quarter dropped to Rs 54.14 crore from Rs 88.10 crore in the year-ago period, with the bulk coming from bank interest and late payment surcharges from beneficiaries. On the policy side, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has directed public sector power companies — including SJVN, NTPC, NHPC, and Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) — to amend their renewable energy tenders to mandate the use of Indian-made solar cells. These PSUs also act as renewable energy implementing agencies (REIAs) as part of India’s plan to achieve 500 GW of non-fossil fuel power capacity by 2030. According to a senior MNRE official, the requirement will take effect 30 days after the ministry publishes “List II” of approved modules and manufacturers, specifically for solar cells. The list is expected next month, meaning tenders floated from October onward will be required to use Indian-made solar cells.

Hyundai Motor shares rally 3% as Goldman Sachs initiates coverage with buy rating,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/hyundai-motor-shares-rally-3-as-goldman-sachs-initiates-coverage-with-buy-rating-13440891.html,"Shares of Hyundai Motor India Ltd. gained as much as 3 percent to Rs 2,222 in morning deals on August 12, extending gains for a second consecutive session after Goldman Sachs initiated coverage with a buy recommendation, citing positive factors for growth. The international brokerage has set a price target of Rs 2,600 per share, implying an upside potential of 21 percent from the last close on the NSE. Goldman Sachs stated that the company has a strong positioning to outpace its peers, particularly in FY27–FY28. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates The brokerage expects growth to be driven by successful EV models, market share gains in emerging markets, and upcoming product launches, which could lift market share by 120 basis points between FY25 and FY28. Hyundai is projected to post over 8 percent volume CAGR over the next three years, compared to the domestic car industry’s 5.3 percent. While near-term startup costs are anticipated, Goldman Sachs believes they will be offset by an improved SUV and export mix, with the company also well-placed to benefit from a potential domestic car market upcycle in FY27. In the first quarter, Hyundai Motor India reported an 8.08 percent year-on-year drop in consolidated net profit to Rs 1,369.23 crore, weighed down by weak domestic sales. In the year-ago period, net profit stood at Rs 1,489.65 crore. Revenue from operations declined 5.37 percent to Rs 16,412.87 crore from Rs 17,344.23 crore in Q1 FY25. EBITDA fell 6.63 percent year-on-year to Rs 2,185.2 crore, while the operating margin narrowed by 20 basis points to 13.3 percent.

Overall volumes slipped 6.1 percent to 1,80,399 units. The Creta remained Hyundai’s top-selling SUV in the quarter with 47,662 units, followed by the Venue at 22,331 units and the Exter at 17,188 units. The company’s portfolio includes 12 ICE models — such as the Grand i10 Nios, Verna, Creta and Alcazar — and two EVs, the Creta Electric and Ioniq 5.

In the same quarter last fiscal, the company had reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 174 crore. Technical View Nifty, after slipping to a low of 24,350 in the previous session, staged a strong rebound to close near the 24,600 mark, easing sentiment to some extent. A decisive move above 24,630 would be needed to strengthen the bias, while immediate support lies at 24,300. Sustaining this level could pave the way for further gains in the coming sessions. Bank Nifty also recovered, taking support at its 100-EMA level of 54,950. The index faces stiff resistance around 56,000, with crucial support at 54,900. For the day, Nifty is expected to trade in the 24,400–24,800 range, while Bank Nifty’s range is seen between 54,800 and 56,200. Tata Steel, Hero MotoCorp, Titan Company, Tech Mahindra, TCS and Reliance Industries were the top gainers on the Nifty. Laggards on the index included Bajaj Finance, Dr Reddy's, Grasim, Eternal, Hindalco, and Adani Enterprises.

"Sensex, Nifty to open marginally higher; key levels to track on August 12",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sensex-nifty-to-open-marginally-higher-key-levels-to-track-on-august-12-13440374.html,"Benchmark indices Nifty and Sensex are set for a positive start on Tuesday, August 12, building on the momentum from Monday’s strong opening to the week. Around 8 am, GIFT Nifty was up 26 points, or 0.1 percent, at 24,597, signalling a steady opening for domestic equities. Bulls staged a strong comeback on August 11, with benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty climbing nearly a percent each, driven by robust buying in PSU banking, realty, and auto stocks. The rebound came as investors shook off last week’s tariff-induced volatility, which had pushed the Nifty to a three-month low and resulted in the index’s longest weekly losing streak in five years. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Foreign Institutional Investors stood as net sellers of equity shares worth Rs 1,202 crore. On the other hand, the market was buoyed by continued positive interest from Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) as they were net buyers of equity shares worth Rs 5,972 crore. Here are the key levels to watch out for in today's session Nifty, after slipping to a low of 24,350 in the previous session, staged a strong rebound to close near the 24,600 mark, easing sentiment to some extent. A decisive move above 24,630 would be needed to strengthen the bias, while immediate support lies at 24,300. Sustaining this level could pave the way for further gains in the coming sessions. Bank Nifty also recovered, taking support at its 100-EMA level of 54,950. The index faces stiff resistance around 56,000, with crucial support at 54,900. For the day, Nifty is expected to trade in the 24,400–24,800 range, while Bank Nifty’s range is seen between 54,800 and 56,200. The fear gauge, India VIX, extended its upward journey for another session, climbing to an intraday high of 12.73 before closing at 12.22, up 1.54 percent. The index sustained above short-term moving averages, signalling caution for bulls. Also read: Trump extends tariff deadline for China by another 90 days The Nifty Put-Call ratio (PCR), which indicates the mood of the market, jumped to 1.03 on August 11, compared to 0.66 in the previous session.

About 1,479 shares advanced compared to 1,255 declining shares on the NSE. The market may remain consolidative and rangebound until it gives a strong close above all key moving averages. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Mehul Kothari, Senior Technical Analyst at Anand Rathi HCL Technologies | CMP: Rs 1,488 HCL Technologies has witnessed a sharp correction of around 17 percent from its recent peak near Rs 1,752. Over the past 7–8 sessions, the stock has consistently held near the 0.618 retracement level, which also coincides with the gap formed on April 22–23, 2025. Notably, prices are trading well below the 100- and 200-day exponential moving averages, indicating the potential for a mean reversion. On the daily charts, the RSI is forming a complex “W” pattern below the oversold threshold of 30, while bullish divergence is visible on the hourly chart. These technical cues suggest a possible rebound. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 1,490–1,450 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,600 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,400 Bharat Petroleum Corporation | CMP: Rs 321 BPCL has recently found strong support, aligning with multiple technical indicators. The price has rebounded from a key trendline, the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level, and the 100-day exponential moving average (DEMA), all converging to reinforce this support zone. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has formed a hidden bullish divergence, indicating that underlying momentum is improving despite recent price weakness. This setup suggests a favourable risk-reward scenario for short-term traders. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 322–318 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 350 Stop-Loss: Rs 300 Titan Company | CMP: Rs 3,467.9 Titan has found support at a confluence of crucial technical levels, raising the likelihood of a short-term recovery. The stock has rebounded from a falling trendline, the 0.50 Fibonacci retracement, and the combined backing of the 100-day and 200-day exponential moving averages (DEMA). This convergence of supports reflects strong buying interest in the current range. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has displayed a hidden bullish divergence, signalling underlying strength despite recent price weakness. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 3,475–3,425 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,750 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,300 Jay Thakkar, Vice President & Head of Derivatives and Quant Research at ICICI Securities Indian Bank | CMP: Rs 674 Indian Bank has provided a breakout from a Rs 50 range and has managed to close above it as well. There has been long buildup in this stock, and with this breakout, long positions are likely to be added, which will provide support at lower levels. There has been significant Put addition from the Rs 630 to Rs 660 strikes, which is a good support range. Meanwhile, the Rs 670 and Rs 680 strikes have a huge Call base, so above those levels, further upward momentum is expected. The stock is trading well above its 20-day VWAP (volume-weighted average price) as well as its maximum pain level, thus confirming an upward breakout. Buy Indian Bank Futures in the range of Rs 680–675. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 700, Rs 725 Stop-Loss: Rs 659 InterGlobe Aviation | CMP: Rs 5,878.5 IndiGo has been consolidating in the range of Rs 5,900 to Rs 5,700 levels, and the stock has been witnessing long buildup, so the breakout is likely to be on the upside. There has been Call unwinding on the lower side, while Put additions have been observed from Rs 5,500 to Rs 5,900 levels. Hence, these levels will act as crucial support. However, Rs 5,900 and Rs 6,000 levels have a significant Call base as well, so a clear breakout will only occur above those levels. Since the stock is trading with a positive bias, the breakout is likely to be on the upside. Buy IndiGo Futures in the range of Rs 5,855 to Rs 5,870. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 6,050, Rs 6,150 Stop-Loss: Rs 5,750 Larsen & Toubro | CMP: Rs 3,668.4 Larsen & Toubro has reversed in the upward direction with a gap post its results. Overall, there has been long buildup in the stock; hence, the medium-term trend is positive. There was some correction due to long unwinding; however, post-results and following some fresh order confirmations, the stock has reversed and turned momentum upward. The stock was consolidating in a narrow range; however, a breakout has occurred, and further long buildup is expected. As per the options data, the Rs 3,700 strike has a huge Call base, so above those levels, further momentum is expected. The stock is trading well above its 20-day VWAP and maximum pain level, hence there is good support on the lower side, making the risk-to-reward ratio favourable for long positions. Buy Larsen & Toubro in the range of Rs 3,665 to Rs 3,675. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,770, Rs 3,820 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,690 Vidnyan S Sawant, Head of Research at GEPL Capital Transrail Lighting | CMP: Rs 798.9 Transrail Lighting is displaying a constructive price structure, consistently forming higher highs and higher lows, reflecting sustained buying interest and positive market sentiment. On the weekly chart, the stock has witnessed a bullish polarity shift, where previous resistance levels have turned into support — a sign of strengthening trend conviction. Additionally, it continues to trade well above its 12- and 26-week EMA levels — a technical setup that typically signals strong medium-term momentum. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 918 Stop-Loss: Rs 750 Fortis Healthcare | CMP: Rs 920.65 Fortis has shown remarkable resilience and strength, outperforming the broader market even during phases of overall weakness. The stock is trading well above its 12-, 26-, and 50-week EMAs, a technical configuration that underscores the stability and strength of its prevailing uptrend. Currently at lifetime highs, it sustains a robust higher-high, higher-low formation — a classic hallmark of a bullish price structure. The MACD indicator remains in positive territory with an upward slope, further validating the presence of strong bullish momentum. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,031 Stop-Loss: Rs 874 One 97 Communications | CMP: Rs 1,122 Paytm is exhibiting a robust positive price structure on the weekly chart, maintaining a pattern of higher highs and higher lows. On the daily timeframe, the stock has staged a bullish mean reversion from the 12-day EMA, supported by a notable rise in volumes above the 20-day average. It continues to hold firmly above the 5-, 12-, and 26-week EMAs, underscoring the strength of its underlying trend. The MACD remains in buy mode, indicating sustained bullish momentum and the potential for further upside. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,232 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,075 GMDC | CMP: Rs 418.3 Gujarat Mineral Development Corporation is exhibiting a bullish polarity shift, with the previous resistance levels of November and December 2024 now serving as strong support in July and August 2025. The weekly chart shows a steady pattern of higher highs and higher lows, reflecting a firmly established uptrend backed by consistent institutional participation. The stock trades comfortably above its 5-, 12-, 25-, and 50-week EMAs, underscoring the strength of the prevailing trend and limiting downside risk.

The company is aiming to defend volumes through tariff mitigation strategies, after it shared that the Q1FY26 adjusted EBITDA includes a net negative tariff impact of $28 million. The Hindalco subsidiary has projected the FY26 capex to be in the range of $1.9-2.2 billion. Novelis CFO Dev Ahuja said the company is 'finding opportunities' to streamline costs, in response to the 'challenging external environment'. US President Trump’s 50 percent tariff on steel and aluminium is expected to impact prices of electronics, cars and several other products. The management said it is confident of 'resilient' demand for aluminium packaging, and sees strong growth to continue in packaging. ""We continue to see strong demand for aluminum beverage packaging sheet supporting top-line growth and the need for new capacity under construction at our plant in Bay Minette, Alabama,"" Steve Fisher, President and CEO of Novelis Inc said. High prices for aluminium scrap hurt the financial performance for the June quarter, but the company is making 'solid progress' on cost reduction which is expected to lower cost base and improve margins, the CEO added. Novelis added that it is looking to accelerate cost reduction steps, which can drive higher cost savings in FY26, and over $300 million by end of FY28. Due to tariff-related uncertainty, Novelis had withheld volume and margin guidance for FY26.","The company is aiming to defend volumes through tariff mitigation strategies, after it shared that the Q1FY26 adjusted EBITDA includes a net negative tariff impact of $28 million.","High prices for aluminium scrap hurt the financial performance for the June quarter, but the company is making 'solid progress' on cost reduction which is expected to lower cost base and improve margins, the CEO added.","Novelis told analysts during an investor call on August 11 after June quarter earnings that despite tariff-related pressures, the aluminium smelting company is eyeing long-term growth through its Alabama greenfield rolling and recycling plant that will have a 600kt capacity upon completion.","High prices for aluminium scrap hurt the financial performance for the June quarter, but the company is making 'solid progress' on cost reduction which is expected to lower cost base and improve margins, the CEO added."

Among sectors, almost all the major sectoral indices traded in positive territory, but the PSU Bank index outperformed, rallying over 2 percent. Technically, after a long correction, the market has formed a reversal pattern on daily charts. Additionally, a bullish candle on daily charts also supports further uptrend from the current levels. We believe that 24,500/80400 and 24,445/80200 would act as key support zones for day traders. Above these levels, the pullback move is likely to continue till 24,700-24,750/81000-81200. On the flip side, below 24,445/80200, sentiment could turn negative. Traders may then prefer to exit their long positions. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The Nifty picked up right where it left off on Friday, but with an entirely different mood. Rising from the ashes, the index staged a spirited comeback, adding nearly 200 points through the day. The earlier breakdown now seems to have given way to a short-term pullback, as the market brushed aside recent weakness. We’re not completely out of the woods yet, but Monday’s bounce from the recent low carries enough steam to power further gains. Immediate support lies at 24,337, with the next upside targets seen around 24,850 and 25,000.

Solar Industries and Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders were up nearly 3 percent, while GRSE and Zen Tech gained nearly 2 percent. Heavyweights Bharat Dynamics (BDL) and Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) were up around 1 percent each. Here are the likely triggers for the sharp rise in the share prices: India's annual defence production hits all time high in FY25: Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh took to X platform on August 9 (Saturday) to announce that India’s annual defence production soared to an all-time high of Rs 1.51 lakh crore in FY25. This marks a strong growth of 18 percent from the Rs 1.27 lakh crore annual output reported for FY24. The defence production rose a whopping 90 percent on-year from the Rs 79,071 crore output reported for FY20. ""I commend the collective efforts of the Department of DefenceProduction and all stakeholders i.e., DPSUs, public sector manufacturers, and the private industry in achieving this landmark. This upward trajectory is a clear indicator of India's strengthening defence industrial base,"" the defence minister wrote in a post on X.Under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri @narendramodi India’s defence production has hit a record high! The annual defence production has soared to an all-time high figure of Rs 1,50,590 crore in the Financial Year (FY) 2024-25. These numbers indicate a robust 18% growth… — Rajnath Singh (@rajnathsingh) August 9, 2025 DRDO chief praises Indian defence equipment’s success during Operation Sindoor: Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) Chairman Samir Kamat on August 9 (Saturday) said BrahMos missiles and the Akashteer defence systems played key roles in 'Operation Sindoor'. ""Operation Sindoor was more than a mission. It was a declaration of India’s ability to stand tall through self-reliance, strategic foresight, and indigenous technological strength. It was a statement to the world that India has the capability to protect its borders through homegrown technology,"" he said while speaking at 14th convocation ceremony of Defence Institute of Advanced Technology (DIAT) in Pune. Kamat explained how BrahMos missile was used as the primary offensive weapon, while anti-drone Akashteer was used for defence. Bharat Dynamics Limited (BDL) manufactures the BrahMos missile. Pakistan's threat to ‘blow up’ Indian dam: Pakistan’s Army Chief Asim Munir has vowed to destroy any dam or water infrastructure India might build on the Indus water channels, following New Delhi’s decision to place the Indus Waters Treaty into abeyance after the April Pahalgam terror attack. Speaking at an event in US, Munir said, ""We will wait for India to build a dam, and when it does so, phir das missile sey faarigh kar dengey (we will destroy it with 10 missiles) … The Indus River is not the Indians’ family property. Humein missilon ki kami nahin hai (we have no shortage of missiles),"" Munir reportedly said, while claiming that India’s move could put 250 million Pakistanis at risk of starvation. The latest threat from the Pakistani army chief has reignited possibility of escalations in geopolitical tensions, which may in turn boost the defence stocks. Defence shares earlier came in focus after the Indian military in May conducted targeted strikes against terrorist outfits in Pakistan and Pakistan occupied Kashmir under the codename 'Operation Sindoor'. As the geopolitical tensions between India and Pakistan eased, the escalating wars between Russia-Ukraine and Israel- Iran further boosted the stocks. However, investors resorted to profit booking recently as geopolitical tensions eased around the globe. Earnings: The sharp rise in share prices also comes as strong earnings by some of the notable players boosted investor sentiment. BEML on August 11 reported a net loss of Rs 64 crore for the April-June quarter of FY26. This marks a notable decline from the Rs 70.5 crore net loss reported for the corresponding quarter of FY25. Revenue from operations were unchanged at Rs 634 crore. GRSE on August 8 reported a net profit of Rs 120 crore for Q1 FY26. This marks a 38 percent on-year rise from the Rs 87 crore net profit reported in Q1 FY25. However, net profit nearly halved sequentially from the Rs 244 crore reported in Q4 FY25. BEML is set to announce its results for the April-June quarter of FY25 today. Value buying: Defence stocks have seen significant correction recently. After rallying a whopping 42 percent since beginning of the year to hit a record high in June, the Nifty India Defence index dropped more than 17 percent as analysts flagged stretched valuations. However, investors may have taken a relook at the stocks after the significant correction, pushing the stocks higher on value buying.

Medanta achieved its highest-ever quarterly revenue, supported by increased patient volumes and improved realization. Notably, 1QFY26 is the first quarter to witness an increase in ARPOB in Patna, led by improved efficiency. This resulted in a dip in Average Length of Stay (ALOS).

NSDL shares close in red for the first time after 62% rally since listing; what lies ahead?,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/nsdl-sees-profit-booking-after-delivering-62-post-listing-gains-stocks-falls-8-from-day-s-high-what-lies-ahead-13434761.html,"The shares of National Securities Depository (NSDL) saw some profit booking on August 11, dropping nearly 11 percent from its day’s high to close in the red for the first time ever. This comes after a record rally of nearly 62 percent since listing. The shares of the company dropped 2 percent to close at Rs 1,273 apiece. Earlier in the day, the stock had jumped nearly 10 percent to trade at Rs 1,425 apiece. The newly listed stock has now declined nearly 8.5 percent from that level. The shares of NSDL had made a decent stock market debut on August 6, listing at Rs 880 apiece on BSE. This marked a premium of 10 percent over its IPO price at Rs 880 apiece. The listing premium was lower than grey market estimates. Analysts had recommended investors to consider holding the stock for the long term, given NSDL’s strong fundamentals and leadership in the depository segment. NSDL’s P/E ratio currently stands at around 79, higher than that of peer CDSL whose P/E ratio currently stands at around 66. What lies ahead? ""As one of only two depositories operating in a near-duopoly alongside CDSL, NSDL enjoys strong pricing power, high entry barriers, and a dominant share in value-based transactions and institutional account holdings,"" said Bhavik Joshi, Business Head, INVasset PMS. He noted that the stock's current P/E multiple of around 77 may appear stretched when compared to CDSL’s 66, but investors are clearly willing to pay a premium for its scale, technology backbone, and long-standing trust within the ecosystem. ""That said, prospective investors should be mindful of certain structural risks — dependence on transaction volumes, evolving investor participation patterns, and the ever-present cybersecurity and regulatory compliance requirements. In the near term, valuations may moderate if market activity slows, offering potential entry points for those who missed the IPO,"" he added. Nitin Jain, Senior Research Analyst at Bonanza, said it is recommended for short-term and listing-gain-focused investors to book some profits. ""The near-term upside may be capped after such a sharp move, and markets tend to see consolidation post a robust debut. If you are a long-term investor willing to ride out near-term volatility, NSDL remains a high-quality stock supported by rising demat penetration,"" he added. NSDL shares are now more expensive than its peer CDSL after its sharp rally, market expert Ambareesh Baliga told CNBC-TV18. ""I think along with long investors shifting from CDSL to NSDL post listing, we have seen huge number of momentum trader getting in, which has pushed the stock higher. So, it will be ideal for IPO investors to book profits at current levels and make a shift back to CDSL,"" he said. Long term investors should use the dips to accumulate further, while short term investors should book profits after the record rally, Sunny Agarwal of SBI Securities told CNBC-TV18.

So far in 2025, the stock has fallen 33 percent, underperforming the Nifty 50 index’s 2 percent gain. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog CLSA maintained a “hold” rating but cut its target price to Rs 1,170 per share, citing a 20 percent year-on-year drop in revenue and a 400 basis point fall in EBITDA margin. The Unitary Cooling Products (UCP) segment’s revenue fell 25 percent year-on-year, with margins plunging to a 10-year low of 3.6 percent. Market share dropped to 17.8 percent from 19.5 percent. CLSA expects recovery from Q3 onwards but sees flat to a 10 percent decline in full-year industry growth, with high inventories continuing to weigh on utilisation and margins. Nomura retained its “neutral” rating with a target price of Rs 1,317 per share. It said Q1FY26 UCP margins missed sharply and warned that competitive intensity may keep margins under pressure despite recovery hopes. The brokerage cut its FY26 revenue growth forecast for room air conditioners to 5 percent, while keeping FY27 and FY28 estimates at 20 percent and 15 percent respectively. It also lowered UCP revenue growth forecasts to 6 percent for FY26 and 24 percent for FY27. In Q1FY26, Voltas’ net profit slumped 58 percent year-on-year to Rs 140.6 crore from Rs 334 crore in the same quarter last year, as unseasonal weather and muted summer demand hit cooling product sales. Revenue fell 20 percent to Rs 3,938.6 crore, while EBITDA halved to Rs 178.6 crore. Operating margins contracted to 4.5 percent from 8.6 percent a year earlier. Management attributed the weak performance to a delayed summer and early monsoon, which dented air-conditioner sales. A high base from last year—when prolonged heat waves boosted record demand—further amplified the decline.

Mexican-American designer apologizes for Adidas sandal design accused of cultural appropriation,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/mexican-american-designer-apologizes-for-adidas-sandal-design-accused-of-cultural-appropriation-2025-08-12/,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexican-American clothing designer Willy Chavarria has apologized for an Adidas sandal he created after being accused by Mexican authorities of “cultural appropriation” for imitating an Indigenous shoe design. The design launched by Adidas, known as the Oaxaca Slip On, is a black sandal with braided leather straps attached to a chunky sports shoe sole. Mexican artisans and authorities say the intricate leather braids look strikingly similar to the traditional footwear known as huaraches made by the Zapotec Indigenous people in Oaxaca, produced mostly in the town of Villa Hidalgo Yalalag. They have accused the brand and Chavarria of “cultural appropriation” and of copying the design without the permission of the Indigenous community. Authorities were quick to note that cultural Mexican designs have long been copied by major brands before, and said they planned to tighten laws to protect Mexican designs. Chavarria responded to mounting criticisms in comments sent to The Associated Press on Tuesday. In a statement addressed to the “people of Oaxaca,” he said that the design was intended to “to honor the powerful cultural and artistic spirit of Oaxaca and its creative communities — a place whose beauty and resistance have inspired me.” “I am deeply sorry that the shoe was appropriated in this design and not developed in direct and meaningful partnership with the Oaxacan community,” Chavarria wrote. “This falls short of the respect and collaborative approach that Oaxaca, the Zapotec community of Villa Hidalgo Yalalag, and its people deserve.” Chavarria is a Mexican-American designer, who has risen to fame for his designs exploring Chicano, or Mexican-American, culture, often mixing Mexican themes with American products. His designs include sweaters reading “Chicano” in red, scripted font, and styles with the Mexican flag and cowboy hats reminiscent of northern Mexican culture. In recent months, Chavarria also was put in the spotlight for a show at Paris Fashion Week that was intended as criticism of the Trump administration's deportation policy. Chavarria's comments came days after Adidas made a public apology for the design, and in a statement said it was reaffirming “our commitment to collaborate with Yalalag in a respectful dialogue that honors their cultural legacy.” Last week, in a letter to Oaxacan state officials, the company requested to sit down with local officials and to discuss how it can “repair the damage” to Indigenous populations. “Adidas recognizes and values the cultural richness of Mexico’s Indigenous communities and the meaning of their artisanal heritage,” it wrote in a statement.","In a statement addressed to the “people of Oaxaca,” he said that the design was intended to “to honor the powerful cultural and artistic spirit of Oaxaca and its creative communities — a place whose beauty and resistance have inspired me.” “I am deeply sorry that the shoe was appropriated in this design and not developed in direct and meaningful partnership with the Oaxacan community,” Chavarria wrote.","Chavarria's comments came days after Adidas made a public apology for the design, and in a statement said it was reaffirming “our commitment to collaborate with Yalalag in a respectful dialogue that honors their cultural legacy.” Last week, in a letter to Oaxacan state officials, the company requested to sit down with local officials and to discuss how it can “repair the damage” to Indigenous populations.","“This falls short of the respect and collaborative approach that Oaxaca, the Zapotec community of Villa Hidalgo Yalalag, and its people deserve.” Chavarria is a Mexican-American designer, who has risen to fame for his designs exploring Chicano, or Mexican-American, culture, often mixing Mexican themes with American products.","In a statement addressed to the “people of Oaxaca,” he said that the design was intended to “to honor the powerful cultural and artistic spirit of Oaxaca and its creative communities — a place whose beauty and resistance have inspired me.” “I am deeply sorry that the shoe was appropriated in this design and not developed in direct and meaningful partnership with the Oaxacan community,” Chavarria wrote."
"Apple & Trump: $100B Investment, Tariffs News Push Shares Up 13%",https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/apple-and-trump-100b-investment-tariffs-news-lead-shares-higher/,"American technology stalwart Apple NASDAQ: AAPL just made headlines, with President Trump's influence and decision-making playing a key role in the stock's story. Below, we’ll detail two key pieces of news and explain why they are leading Apple shares higher. In February, Apple announced it would make a massive $500 billion investment in the United States over the next four years. On Aug. 6, the Magnificent Seven company upped the ante, committing an additional $100 billion investment to its home country. This move comes amid President Trump’s unwavering stance that he wants to see iPhones built in America. Trump reiterated this stance in a joint press conference with Apple CEO Tim Cook to announce the new investment. He called the investment “a significant step toward the ultimate goal of ensuring that iPhones sold in the United States of America also are made in America."" Cook did not parrot this notion. The economic advantage of producing iPhones overseas makes this unlikely. Analysts have estimated that producing an iPhone in the United States could bring its price to $3,500. That’s nearly triple the cost of the company’s most expensive iPhone 16 Pro Max model today, which retails for $1,199. This price increase would massively deteriorate Apple’s competitive positioning in the smartphone market. It is certainly not something investors should hope for. That’s part of the reason that markets are happy about the company’s latest U.S. investment. Trump has ramped up tariff pressure on Apple to get the firm to move iPhone manufacturing to the United States. With the latest investment, the company is garnering goodwill from the President, which can help it stay out of his tariff crosshairs. In the same press conference, Trump floated a 100% tariff on semiconductor imports. However, he said that companies that invest in America, like Apple, would be exempt from such regulations. Apple is playing ball with the President to protect its interests, and thus those of its shareholders. Additionally, on Aug. 6, Trump declared that he would raise India's tariff to 50%, starting 21 days after Aug. 7. This change is a response to India's continued oil imports from Russia. Initially, this appeared highly relevant to Apple. The company has moved much of its production for U.S.-sold iPhones to India, partly to avoid U.S. tariffs imposed on its traditional manufacturing hub, China. It reportedly hopes to move most of this production to India by the end of 2026. Higher tariffs on India would severely limit the company’s ambitions to avoid higher costs. However, further reports revealed that smartphones would be exempt from Indian tariffs. Apple won’t have to pay tariffs on Indian-made iPhones at all. It’s not unreasonable to think that the company’s $100 billion investment contributed to Trump’s exemption decision. Overall, Apple’s U.S. investments are helping it avoid tariffs in more ways than one: both on country and product-specific levies. Ultimately, these pieces of news led to Apple stock having one of its best weeks in quite a while. From Aug. 4 to Aug. 8, shares gained by more than 13%. Trump's tirade against the company has been one of the key factors weighing on Apple in 2025, with shares still down significantly on the year. Thus, it is only fitting that positive developments related to President Trump have resulted in positive price action. These news items are clearly good signs for Apple, indicating that the company could face less pressure from Trump going forward. Still, whether Apple can truly return to being a winner for stock market investors remains up in the air. The company has been extensively criticized for making underwhelming moves in artificial intelligence (AI). Markets want to see something change in the company's approach so that Apple can prove that it isn’t missing the boat on AI.

Oklo’s Stock Is Set up for a Correction—Buy It When It Bounces,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/oklos-stock-is-set-up-for-a-correctionbuy-it-when-it-bounces/,"Oklo’s NYSE: OKLO stock is poised for a correction in mid-Q3 because its explosive stock price increase attracted a fair number of short sellers, and the Q2 earnings release did not accelerate the timeline. The release was good, chock full of juicy news to keep investors interested, but no concrete changes or improvements to the revenue timeline. The takeaway is that this leading, advanced reactor company is well-positioned to deliver on its promise, with projects advancing, but no catalyst for higher share prices has emerged. In this scenario, the market could fall as much as 20% from the pre-release closing price before it begins to rebound, but when it does, it will be a screaming buy. Oklo is the leader in advanced, fast-reactor technology within the energy sector and is on track to commence operations within only a few years. Its vertically integrated model encompasses fuel, power, and adjacent isotope markets, offering a diversified income stream and cost efficiencies unmatched by any other advanced reactor company. Critical highlights from the quarter include the Trump administration's numerous executive orders, which clear red tape, streamline and accelerate approval processes, and provide tax credits and funding for start-up projects. Among the impacts of the orders is the potential for a technology-proving pilot project to come online as soon as July 2026, years ahead of the existing timeline. Other critical highlights include partnerships with Vertiv, Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power, and Centrus that expand and deepen the company’s industry appeal while prepping future revenue streams. The initial analysts’ response to Oklo’s news is crickets; MarketBeat tracked no notes or revisions within the first 18 hours of the release. This is good news because the trends leading into the release were bullish, providing support for this market. The trends include increased coverage with the number of analysts rising by more than 200% to 13 since the first of the year, the Moderate Buy sentiment firming with several Strong Buy ratings creeping into the mix, and the price target advancing. The consensus lags the market in mid-August but is up more than 400% in the preceding 12 months, with the high-end range aligning with recent price action. The takeaway is that the market for OKLO stock outpaced analysts' sentiment, and their targets align with a price pullback. However, the price targets should provide solid support near the $60 level if not higher, aligning with the technical support targets. The institutional group is likely to be buyers on an OKLO stock price pullback. The group owns 85% of the stock and has been buying robustly this year, netting $2 in shares for every $1 sold. The Q3 activity shows buying ramping to a multiquarter high in the first half of Q3, an indication of increased demand and market support. While the long-term outlook for OKLO stock is bullish, the high and rising short-interest suggests the top is in for Q3 and potentially the remainder of the year. The short interest has been growing over the past few months and is running near 15% as of late July, and will likely remain high if not increase as the quarter progresses. The catalyst to cover will be a concrete improvement in the timeline to revenue, which could come at any time but may not materialize for several quarters. The post-release price action was tepid; however, the market fell more than 1% suggesting it is ready to move lower. The critical near-term support is near the $69 level; a move below it will likely attract bearish activity and result in a more profound decline. Before you consider Oklo, you'll want to hear this.","The short interest has been growing over the past few months and is running near 15% as of late July, and will likely remain high if not increase as the quarter progresses.","The trends include increased coverage with the number of analysts rising by more than 200% to 13 since the first of the year, the Moderate Buy sentiment firming with several Strong Buy ratings creeping into the mix, and the price target advancing.",The institutional group is likely to be buyers on an OKLO stock price pullback.,"The trends include increased coverage with the number of analysts rising by more than 200% to 13 since the first of the year, the Moderate Buy sentiment firming with several Strong Buy ratings creeping into the mix, and the price target advancing."
Spirit Airlines sounds the alarm on its future ability to stay in business,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/spirit-airlines-sounds-the-alarm-on-its-future-ability-to-stay-in-business-2025-08-12/,"NEW YORK (AP) — Just five months after emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, Spirit Airlines is warning about its future ability to stay in business. Spirit Aviation Holdings, the budget carrier's parent company, says it has “substantial doubt” about its ability to continue as a going concern over the next year — which is accounting-speak for running out of money. In a quarterly report issued Monday, Spirit pointed to “adverse market conditions"" that it's continued to face after a recent restructuring and other efforts to revive its business. That includes weak demand for domestic leisure travel, which Spirit said persisted in the second quarter of its fiscal year — among other challenges and “uncertainties in its business operations” that the Florida company expects to continue “for at least the remainder of 2025.” Spirit’s shares tumbled nearly 40% by midday Tuesday, with the company’s stock trading at just over $2.20 as of around 1 p.m. ET. Known for its no-frills, low-cost flights on a fleet of bright yellow planes, Spirit has struggled to recover and compete since the COVID-19 pandemic. Rising operation costs and mounting debt eventually led the company to seek bankruptcy protection in November. By the time of that Chapter 11 filing, the airline had lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020. When Spirit emerged from bankruptcy protection in March, the company successfully restructured some of its debt obligations and secured new financing for future operations. Spirit has continued to make other cost-cutting efforts since — including plans to furlough about 270 pilots and downgrade some 140 captains to first officers in the coming months. The furloughs and downgrades announced last month go into effect Oct. 1 and Nov. 1 to align with Spirit's “projected flight volume for 2026,” the company noted in its quarterly report. They also follow previous furloughs and job cuts before the company's bankruptcy filing last year. Despite these and other cost-cutting efforts, Spirit on Monday stressed that it needs more cash. As a result, the company said it may also sell certain aircraft and real estate. And as discount carriers struggle to compete with bigger airlines — many of which have snagged budget-conscious customers through their own tiered offerings — Spirit is attempting to tap into the growing market for more upscale travel. It is now offering flight options with tiered prices, the higher-priced tickets coming with more amenities. The company pointed to the new strategy again on Monday. Spirit’s aircraft fleet is relatively young, which has also made the airline an attractive takeover target. But such buyout attempts from budget rivals like JetBlue and Frontier were unsuccessful both before and during the bankruptcy process, and Spirit has not publicly indicated interest in such a transaction since.","In a quarterly report issued Monday, Spirit pointed to “adverse market conditions"" that it's continued to face after a recent restructuring and other efforts to revive its business.","That includes weak demand for domestic leisure travel, which Spirit said persisted in the second quarter of its fiscal year — among other challenges and “uncertainties in its business operations” that the Florida company expects to continue “for at least the remainder of 2025.” Spirit’s shares tumbled nearly 40% by midday Tuesday, with the company’s stock trading at just over $2.20 as of around 1 p.m.","When Spirit emerged from bankruptcy protection in March, the company successfully restructured some of its debt obligations and secured new financing for future operations.","That includes weak demand for domestic leisure travel, which Spirit said persisted in the second quarter of its fiscal year — among other challenges and “uncertainties in its business operations” that the Florida company expects to continue “for at least the remainder of 2025.” Spirit’s shares tumbled nearly 40% by midday Tuesday, with the company’s stock trading at just over $2.20 as of around 1 p.m."
Alphabet Reclaims $200 Threshold—Bull Run Reignited?,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/alphabet-reclaims-200-thresholdbull-run-reignited/,"Alphabet NASDAQ: GOOGL has quietly transformed what began as a shaky start to 2025 into a full-blown comeback. The stock lagged its Magnificent Seven peers early in the year, weighed down by regulatory fears and concerns that its dominance in search and advertising was wavering. Those worries are fading, and with them, the bears. As Alphabet leaned into its AI prowess, cloud strength, and ad resilience, its shares surged, and momentum is now firmly back. The stock is officially in the green year-to-date, up 6.18% as of Monday’s close, and has rocketed 32% in the past quarter alone, including an 11.5% jump this month alone. Most importantly, Alphabet has reclaimed the $200 level, a psychological and technical resistance point that had held it back for six months. Now sitting just under 3% from its 52-week high, Alphabet is setting itself up for a fresh breakout into uncharted territory. Technically, this is not an overbought sprint. Alphabet is still building its base, not blowing past resistance like many red-hot tech peers. The clean push through $200 after building weeks of momentum below it suggests more upside could be ahead, as long as the rally remains contained and measured. Alphabet’s compelling Q2 2025 earnings, released on July 23, are at the heart of the rebound. Total revenue of $96.43 billion beat expectations and reflected a substantial 14% year-over-year gain. Earnings per share came in at $2.31, well above consensus and up 22% YOY. Key growth came from advertising, cloud, and search. Google Cloud soared 32% to $13.62 billion, crossing the $50 billion annual run rate landmark. YouTube ad revenue climbed 13%, and, perhaps most importantly, Google Search & Other grew 11.7%, well above the 8% expected, helping to quiet concerns about AI disrupting Alphabet’s core business. These results weren’t ignored. Following the blowout quarter, a wave of analysts raised their price targets. Barclays lifted its target to $235 from $220, and JPMorgan increased it to $232 from $200. Multiple other firms followed suit. Institutional money also started flowing back in. Cathie Wood’s ARKW recently added $35 million in Alphabet shares. Zooming out, over the previous twelve months, institutions have been busy buying shares of the tech giant. In total, $96 billion worth of GOOGL has been purchased versus $52 billion in outflows over the previous year. Despite the surge in momentum, GOOGL still looks reasonably priced. Its current P/E is around 21.4, and its forward P/E of 18.9 remains well below its historical standards. So even after a 32% quarterly move, Alphabet isn’t trading at a tech bubble multiple, making the risk-reward picture more compelling for disciplined investors. For those anticipating more upside, a logical entry could be on a pullback toward key support zones near $190 or even $180, where resistance was overturned earlier in the year. If Alphabet can reclaim a clean stair-step pattern above $200, reinforced by analyst upgrades and institutional faith, it could quietly morph into one of this year’s strongest major-cap tech stories.

"Syria, US and Jordan say they will work toward a lasting truce in wake of Syrian sectarian clashes",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/jordan-syria-and-us-officials-discuss-syrias-reconstruction-after-deadly-clashes-2025-08-12/,"BEIRUT (AP) — Syrian, U.S. and Jordanian officials said Tuesday they would work together toward a permanent ceasefire in a southern Syrian region wracked by deadly sectarian clashes last month that threatened the country's fragile transition in the wake of its yearslong civil war. The announcement came after three-way talks, held in the Jordanian capital of Amman, seeking ways to support post-war reconstruction efforts of Syria's new authorities. The discussions between U.S. special envoy Tom Barrack and Syrian and Jordanian foreign ministers, Asaad al-Shibani and Ayman Safadi, were the second such meeting, following talks held in July. The first round focused on a ceasefire that ended days of clashes in the southern Sweida province between government forces and local Bedouin tribesmen on one side, and fighters from the country’s Druze minority on the other. Hundreds were killed, including many civilians. Since Islamist-led insurgents ousted former President Bashar Assad in a rebel offensive in December, the new government they put in place in Damascus has struggled to maintain stability and heal the wounds of the nearly 14-year civil war. Though the fighting in Sweida has largely ended, tensions remain and minority communities have grown increasingly wary of the new authorities in the capital of Damascus, calling for a decentralized government. A joint statement issued after Tuesday's Amman talks reaffirmed that Sweida, “with all its local communities, is an integral part” of Syria and that the safety of its communities must be safeguarded and ""preserved in the process of rebuilding a new Syria.” It backed efforts to investigate “crimes and violations” committed in Sweida — including allegations that government fighters executed Druze civilians. Videos of such killings have caused an outcry, including recent footage of what appears to be the killing of a medic by men in military uniform in a Sweida hospital. Tensions have also risen between the central government in Damascus and the U.S.-allied and Kurdish-led forces that control northeastern Syria. Implementation of an agreement reached in March to merge the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces with the Syrian army, made up of mostly former rebels and insurgents, has stalled, and there have been scattered outbreaks of violence between the two sides. Syria's state-run news agency SANA reported on Tuesday that SDF fighters had infiltrated an area controlled by the Syrian army east of the city of Aleppo, leading to clashes that killed a Syrian soldier. Syria also faces major economic and social challenges. In 2017, the United Nations estimated that it would cost at least $250 billion to rebuild Syria while some experts now say that figure is more likely to be at least $400 billion. Several countries, including Saudi Arabia, Qatar and others have in recent months pledged investments worth billions of dollars to rebuild Syria's infrastructure. Syrian Energy Minister Mohammed al-Bashir met with his Iraqi counterpart, Hayan Abdel-Ghani, in Iraq where they discussed the possibility of reactivating an oil pipeline between the oil-rich northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk and Syria's coastal town of Baniyas, which is home to one of the country’s two oil refineries. SANA quoted al-Bashir as saying that Syria imports 3 million barrels of oil a month, in addition to its own production, to cover local consumption. The report cited Abdel-Ghani as saying the two countries would have to look into what it would take to reactivate the pipeline, which suffered wide damage during wars in both countries — or build a new one. Before the war broke out in 2011, the oil sector was a pillar of Syria’s economy, with the country producing about 380,000 barrels a day, and exports — mostly to Europe — bringing in more than $3 billion in 2010. Since then, the sector has suffered widely.","A joint statement issued after Tuesday's Amman talks reaffirmed that Sweida, “with all its local communities, is an integral part” of Syria and that the safety of its communities must be safeguarded and ""preserved in the process of rebuilding a new Syria.” It backed efforts to investigate “crimes and violations” committed in Sweida — including allegations that government fighters executed Druze civilians.","A joint statement issued after Tuesday's Amman talks reaffirmed that Sweida, “with all its local communities, is an integral part” of Syria and that the safety of its communities must be safeguarded and ""preserved in the process of rebuilding a new Syria.” It backed efforts to investigate “crimes and violations” committed in Sweida — including allegations that government fighters executed Druze civilians.","Several countries, including Saudi Arabia, Qatar and others have in recent months pledged investments worth billions of dollars to rebuild Syria's infrastructure.","A joint statement issued after Tuesday's Amman talks reaffirmed that Sweida, “with all its local communities, is an integral part” of Syria and that the safety of its communities must be safeguarded and ""preserved in the process of rebuilding a new Syria.” It backed efforts to investigate “crimes and violations” committed in Sweida — including allegations that government fighters executed Druze civilians."
Kodak cautions on business operations but remains confident it can meet debt obligations,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/kodak-cautions-theres-substantial-doubt-about-its-ability-to-stay-in-business-2025-08-12/,"The more than 130-year-old Eastman Kodak Co. is cautioning on its business operations, but says it is confident it will be able to work out upcoming debt obligations. “Kodak has debt coming due within 12 months and does not have committed financing or available liquidity to meet such debt obligations if they were to become due in accordance with their current terms,” the company wrote in a regulatory filing. “These conditions raise substantial doubt about Kodak's ability to continue as a going concern.” The Rochester, New York-based company said that it had $155 million of cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, with $70 million held within the U.S. Kodak said in a statement on Tuesday that the going concern language in its regulatory filing is essentially a required disclosure because its debt comes due within 12 months of the filing. “Kodak is confident it will be able to pay off a significant portion of its term loan well before it becomes due, and amend, extend or refinance our remaining debt and/or preferred stock obligations,” the company said. Last year Kodak said that it would end its retirement income plan in order to pay down debt, according to The Wall Street Journal. Kodak Chief Financial Officer David Bullwinkle said in a statement on Monday that the company expects to know by Friday how it will satisfy its obligations to pay all pension plan participants and foresees completing the reversion by December. Founded by George Eastman in 1880, Eastman Kodak Co. is credited with popularizing photography at the start of the 20th century and was known all over the world for its Brownie and Instamatic cameras and its yellow-and-red film boxes. It was first brought down by Japanese competition and then an inability to keep pace with the shift from film to digital technology. Kodak filed for bankruptcy protection in 2012 after struggling with increasing competition, continuing growth in digital photography and growing debt. The company wound up selling off many of its businesses and patents, while shutting down the camera manufacturing unit that first made it famous. It received approval for its plan to emerge from court oversight a year later. At the time, Kodak was looking to recreate itself as a new, much smaller company focused on commercial and packaging printing. Kodak is now nearing completion on a manufacturing plant to create regulated pharmaceutical products. The company already makes unregulated key starting materials for pharmaceuticals. Production at the retrofitted facility is expected to start later this year. Shares slid more than 25% in midday trading.","The more than 130-year-old Eastman Kodak Co. is cautioning on its business operations, but says it is confident it will be able to work out upcoming debt obligations.","“These conditions raise substantial doubt about Kodak's ability to continue as a going concern.” The Rochester, New York-based company said that it had $155 million of cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, with $70 million held within the U.S. Kodak said in a statement on Tuesday that the going concern language in its regulatory filing is essentially a required disclosure because its debt comes due within 12 months of the filing.","At the time, Kodak was looking to recreate itself as a new, much smaller company focused on commercial and packaging printing.","“These conditions raise substantial doubt about Kodak's ability to continue as a going concern.” The Rochester, New York-based company said that it had $155 million of cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, with $70 million held within the U.S. Kodak said in a statement on Tuesday that the going concern language in its regulatory filing is essentially a required disclosure because its debt comes due within 12 months of the filing."
How Vertiv Is Cashing in on AI's Power Crisis,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/how-vertiv-is-cashing-in-on-ais-power-crisis/,"The artificial intelligence (AI) boom is hitting a wall—not a digital one, but one made of concrete, copper, and cooling pipes. While investors have focused on the brilliant chip designers creating AI brains, the technology titans deploying these processors are facing a much more fundamental challenge. The sheer power consumption and immense heat generated by AI servers are straining data centers and the utility sector to their limits. This physical infrastructure challenge has quietly become the most significant bottleneck holding back the next wave of AI expansion, creating a new and essential investment category for those who provide the foundational solutions. Vertiv Holdings Company’s NYSE: VRT portfolio of products hits right at the core of the issue, which lies in the incredible density of modern AI systems. Thousands of powerful GPUs are packed tightly into server racks to achieve maximum performance. According to Vertiv’s CEO, Giordano Albertazzi, these configurations push rack power densities into the ""three- and four-digit kWs,"" a level of energy concentration that generates a thermal crisis. Traditional air-cooling methods, which involve blowing cold air across servers, are simply no match for this intensity. Without a more effective solution, these multibillion-dollar AI clusters cannot run at their full potential. This is the specific problem Vertiv is designed to solve. As a global leader in critical digital infrastructure, the company's offerings are non-negotiable requirements for the AI era. Recognizing that its customers' most significant challenge is deployment speed, Vertiv has moved beyond selling individual products to offering integrated solutions. Its recent launch of Vertiv OneCore is a prime example. This prefabricated, modular system allows a data center's entire power and cooling infrastructure to be built in a factory and deployed rapidly on-site, drastically cutting down construction timelines. Rack-specialist Great Lakes' planned acquisition further strengthens Vertiv’s strategic focus on integrated, turnkey solutions. This deal, expected to finalize in the third quarter of 2025, deepens Vertiv’s position as a one-stop shop for building the AI factories of the future. Vertiv’s strategic positioning at the heart of the AI build-out is generating impressive and tangible financial results. The company’s second-quarter 2025 earnings report provided a clear confirmation of its momentum, surpassing analyst estimates and demonstrating that the company is effectively converting surging demand into shareholder value. For investors tracking the company's progress, several key metrics stand out: This powerful performance gave management the confidence to raise its full-year 2025 guidance for key financial metrics, including net sales, adjusted earnings per share (EPS), and free cash flow. An upward revision of this nature signals to the market that company leadership sees a clear and sustainable growth path ahead. Following a year where Vertiv’s stock price has appreciated by over 95%, the company commands a premium valuation, with a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 67. This valuation reflects the market's belief that Vertiv is not just another industrial company but a critical and long-term enabler of the entire AI secular trend. Its growth is directly tied to one of a generation's most powerful technology shifts. Institutional experts share this bullish sentiment. A consensus of 22 Wall Street analysts rates the stock a Moderate Buy, and many have increased their price targets in the wake of the company's recent strong results. While the company did note temporary margin pressures from tariffs and the costs associated with scaling its manufacturing footprint to meet the demand surge, management laid out a clear action plan and expressed confidence that these operational headwinds will be ""materially resolved by year-end."" The company's financial forecast supports this, implying a strong margin recovery to over 23% in the fourth quarter, setting a positive trajectory for 2026. Ultimately, Vertiv's story is one of a company providing an indispensable solution to an industry's most pressing problem. Its role as a foundational enabler of the AI revolution, backed by strong execution and financial momentum, makes it a compelling pick-and-shovel investment for those looking to participate in the growth of the entire AI ecosystem.

A UFC fight at the White House? Dana White says it's happening as part of deal with Paramount,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/a-ufc-fight-at-the-white-house-dana-white-says-its-happening-as-part-of-deal-with-paramount-2025-08-12/,"Hours after Paramount and UFC announced a billion-dollar rights deal, Dana White said he had yet to hear from his friend, President Donald Trump, on his thoughts about the fight company’s new streaming home. That was fine with White. The UFC CEO was set to travel to Washington on Aug. 28 to meet with Trump and his daughter, Ivanka, to catch up and discuss logistics on the proposed Fourth of July fight card next year at the White House. Trump said last month he wanted to stage a UFC match on the White House grounds with upwards of 20,000 spectators to celebrate 250 years of American independence. “It’s absolutely going to happen,"" White told The Associated Press. “Think about that, the 250th birthday of the United States of America, the UFC will be on the White House south lawn live on CBS.” The idea of cage fights at the White House would have seemed improbable when the Fertitta brothers purchased UFC for $2 million in 2001 and put White in charge of the fledging fight promotion. White helped steer the company into a $4 billion sale in 2016 and broadcast rights deals with Fox and ESPN before landing owner TKO Group's richest one yet — a seven-year deal with Paramount starting in 2026 worth an average of $1.1 billion a year, with all cards on its streaming platform Paramount+ and select numbered events also set to simulcast on CBS. ESPN, Amazon and Netflix and other traditional sports broadcast players seemed more in play for UFC rights — White had previously hinted fights could air across different platforms — but Paramount was a serious contender from the start of the negotiating window. The Paramount and UFC deal came just days after Skydance and Paramount officially closed their $8 billion merger — kicking off the reign of a new entertainment giant after a contentious endeavor to get the transaction over the finish line. White said he was impressed with the vision Skydance CEO David Ellison had for the the global MMA leader early in contract talks and how those plans should blossom now that Ellison is chairman and CEO of Paramount. “When you talk about Paramount, you talk about David Ellison, they're brilliant businessmen, very aggressive, risk takers,” White said. “They're right up my alley. These are the kind of guys that I like to be in business with.” The $1.1 billion deals marks a notable jump from the roughly $550 million that ESPN paid each year for UFC coverage today. But UFC’s new home on Paramount will simplify offerings for fans — with all content set to be available on Paramount+ (which currently costs between $7.99 and $12.99 a month), rather than various pay-per-view fees. Paramount also said it intends to explore UFC rights outside the U.S. “as they become available in the future.” UFC matchmakers were set to meet this week to shape what White said would be a loaded debut Paramount card. The UFC boss noted it was still too early to discuss a potential main event for the White House fight night. “This is a 1-of-1 event,” White said. There are still some moving parts to UFC broadcasts and other television programming it has its hands in as the company moves into the Paramount era. White said there are still moving parts to the deal and that includes potentially finding new homes for “The Ultimate Fighter,” “Road To UFC,” and “Dana White’s Contender Series.” It's not necessarily a given the traditional 10 p.m. start time for what were the pay-per-view events would stand, especially on nights cards will also air on CBS. “We haven’t figured that out yet but we will,” White said. And what about the sometimes-contentious issue of fighter pay? Some established fighters have clauses in their contracts that they earn more money the higher the buyrate on their cards. Again, most of those issues are to-be-determined as UFC and Paramount settle in to the new deal — with $1.1 billion headed the fight company's way. “It will affect fighter pay, big time,” White said. “From deal-to-deal, fighter pay has grown, too. Every time we win, everybody wins.” Boxer Jake Paul wrote on social media the dying PPV model — which was overpriced for fights as UFC saw a decline in buys because of missing star power in many main events — should give the fighters an increased idea of their worth. “Every fighter in the UFC now has a clear picture of what the revenue is...no more PPV excuses,” Paul wrote. “Get your worth boys and girls.” White also scoffed at the idea that the traditional PPV model is dead. There are still UFC cards on pay-per-view the rest of the year through the end of the ESPN contract and White and Saudi Arabia have teamed to launch a new boxing venture that starts next year and could use a PPV home. White, though, is part of the promotional team for the Canelo Álvarez and Terence Crawford fight in September in Las Vegas that airs on Netflix. “It’s definitely not run it’s course,” White said. “There were guys out there who were interested in pay-per-view and there were guys out there that weren’t. Wherever we ended up, that’s what we’re going to roll with.” White said UFC archival footage “kills it” in repeat views and those classic bouts also needed a new home once the ESPN deal expires. Just when it seems there's little left for UFC to conquer, White says, there's always more. Why stop at becoming the biggest fight game in the world? Why not rewrite the pecking order in popularity and riches and go for No. 1 in all sports? “You have the NFL, the NBA, the UFC, and soccer globally,” White said. “We’re coming. We’re coming for all of them.” ___ AP sports: https://apnews.com/sports","White said there are still moving parts to the deal and that includes potentially finding new homes for “The Ultimate Fighter,” “Road To UFC,” and “Dana White’s Contender Series.” It's not necessarily a given the traditional 10 p.m. start time for what were the pay-per-view events would stand, especially on nights cards will also air on CBS.","White said there are still moving parts to the deal and that includes potentially finding new homes for “The Ultimate Fighter,” “Road To UFC,” and “Dana White’s Contender Series.” It's not necessarily a given the traditional 10 p.m. start time for what were the pay-per-view events would stand, especially on nights cards will also air on CBS.","Every time we win, everybody wins.” Boxer Jake Paul wrote on social media the dying PPV model — which was overpriced for fights as UFC saw a decline in buys because of missing star power in many main events — should give the fighters an increased idea of their worth.","“Think about that, the 250th birthday of the United States of America, the UFC will be on the White House south lawn live on CBS.” The idea of cage fights at the White House would have seemed improbable when the Fertitta brothers purchased UFC for $2 million in 2001 and put White in charge of the fledging fight promotion."
MP Materials Stock Rides Rare Earth Boom to New Highs,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/mp-materials-stock-rides-rare-earth-boom-to-new-highs/,"Most investors would be wary of buying into a company that has yet to reach net profitability, though sometimes the macro narrative and the company-specific developments warrant a second look at some upside potential in this story. Today, one stock in the basic materials sector fits that description for several reasons. MP Materials Corp. NYSE: MP shares are trading near their 52-week highs for a good reason. Not only that, but this stock also has the potential to break into a new ceiling in the coming months and quarters, as the macro backdrop and rising investment interest make this stock a hot pick to keep in a growth portfolio. This is where investors can look beyond the pre-profit stage of this company and explore why it has seen such bullish price action. By delivering an aggressive run of 147% over the past month alone, some investors may wonder what could make this stock go higher even when operating at a loss, and whether this momentum will still be enough to deliver higher prices. Today, those doubts may as well wash away, because here’s why MP Materials is a stock investors want to keep around for a while. The United States has now gone on a trade tariff cycle, mainly focusing on Asia and the materials that come from the region. With this in mind, one of the items that has gotten the most attention in these tariff implementations is rare earth metals, used both in the defense and technology sectors of the United States. Given the United States' limited domestic sources of rare earth metals, those that have already demonstrated a successful case study are likely to receive the majority of government grants and favor, which is precisely where MP Materials stock comes into play. Digging into MP Materials' latest quarterly earnings report may help investors understand these current developments. Starting with the top line, MP Materials reported revenue growing to a high of $57.4 million during the quarter, or 84% higher than the same quarter last year. This revenue increase can be mainly credited to the record production of its materials, which reached 597 metric tons during the quarter, representing a massive 119% increase over the past 12 months. Some bears may say that this is a fluke of a quarter that may not repeat in the future. However, there is now evidence that that is not the case. This quarter may only suggest what could come for the future of MP Materials, especially now that new partnerships have been announced. The United States government, specifically the Department of Defense, has looked to MP Materials for answers. MP Materials will not only provide rare earth metals for defense purposes across the globe but also receive additional government support from the United States. After a significant investment over the past quarter, the Pentagon is now the largest shareholder in MP Materials. This is both a vote of confidence in the company’s ability to deliver on the demand needs for the United States defense, and also an ownership stake that guarantees only American interests are involved in management’s future decision-making and pivotal moves. Moreover, rare earth metals play a significant role in the current artificial intelligence race, particularly in areas related to semiconductors and chips. This is why Apple Inc. NASDAQ: AAPL also decided to join the Pentagon in this partnership bidding with MP Materials. Now investors have access to two of the biggest tailwinds happening in the global economy, both of which are now pushing MP Materials stock’s prospects higher. Knowing this, it shouldn’t surprise investors to see short sellers start to run away from this name. Over the past month, 8.3% of MP Materials’ short interest declined as a clear sign of bearish capitulation, but that’s not all. Considering that there are still $1.6 billion worth of open short positions in this stock, another rally like this one could force all these short sellers to close their positions at a loss, which involves buying back the stock for additional upward pressure. Before you consider MP Materials, you'll want to hear this.","With this in mind, one of the items that has gotten the most attention in these tariff implementations is rare earth metals, used both in the defense and technology sectors of the United States.","Not only that, but this stock also has the potential to break into a new ceiling in the coming months and quarters, as the macro backdrop and rising investment interest make this stock a hot pick to keep in a growth portfolio.","This quarter may only suggest what could come for the future of MP Materials, especially now that new partnerships have been announced.","Not only that, but this stock also has the potential to break into a new ceiling in the coming months and quarters, as the macro backdrop and rising investment interest make this stock a hot pick to keep in a growth portfolio."
Argentine leader Milei launches initiative to boost Israel-Latin America ties,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/argentine-leader-milei-launches-initiative-to-boost-israel-latin-america-ties-2025-08-12/,"TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Argentine President Javier Milei is helping to launch a $1 million initiative to improve diplomatic relations between Israel and several Latin American countries at a time when Israel is facing intense international criticism over its operations in Gaza. The Isaac Accords, funded by money from the Genesis Prize that Milei received two months ago in Jerusalem, will increase ties between Israel, Uruguay, Panama and Costa Rica, according to the Genesis Prize announcement on Tuesday. Argentina, under Milei, already has solid ties with Israel. His posture stands in contrast to most of Latin America — where Bolivia and Colombia have severed ties with Israel and other countries have recalled their ambassadors. The new initiative’s name is a nod to the Abraham Accords, which recognized bilateral relations between Israel and several Arab states starting in 2020, during U.S. President Donald Trump’s first administration. In 2026, the Isaac Accords plans to expand to Brazil, Colombia, Chile, and possibly El Salvador, according to the organizers, the American Friends of the Isaac Accords. Milei was awarded the Genesis Prize in Jerusalem on June 12 in recognition of his support for Israel, especially when many countries and international organizations, including the United Nations, have condemned Israel’s actions in Gaza. Milei is among the greatest supporters of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s right-wing government when it comes to world leaders, as Israel faces growing isolation over its bombardment and invasion of Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attacks on Oct. 7, 2023. Although born and raised Roman Catholic, Milei has increasingly shown public interest in Judaism and even expressed intentions to convert.","The Isaac Accords, funded by money from the Genesis Prize that Milei received two months ago in Jerusalem, will increase ties between Israel, Uruguay, Panama and Costa Rica, according to the Genesis Prize announcement on Tuesday.","TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Argentine President Javier Milei is helping to launch a $1 million initiative to improve diplomatic relations between Israel and several Latin American countries at a time when Israel is facing intense international criticism over its operations in Gaza.","Milei is among the greatest supporters of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s right-wing government when it comes to world leaders, as Israel faces growing isolation over its bombardment and invasion of Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attacks on Oct. 7, 2023.","In 2026, the Isaac Accords plans to expand to Brazil, Colombia, Chile, and possibly El Salvador, according to the organizers, the American Friends of the Isaac Accords."
AMD Paves Path for Market Share Gains: Stock Rally Has Just Begun,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/amd-paves-path-for-market-share-gains-stock-rally-has-just-begun/,"Advanced Micro Devices' NASDAQ: AMD share price is rebounding so strongly in 2025 because the outlook originally priced into the market in 2023/2024 has finally been affirmed. If you are wondering if its share price can continue to rise, the answer is yes. The outlook, tied to data centers and AI, includes the long-awaited market share gains that will come at the expense of NVIDIA NASDAQ: NVDA. NVIDIA, the undisputed leader in AI infrastructure today, secured its position due to its first-mover advantage. That advantage lies in its GPU semiconductor technology, the infrastructure to support parallel computing, and the capability to deliver solutions at rack scale. Those last two words, rack scale, truly matter; it is why NVIDIA commands roughly 90% of the market. The hyperscalers using NVIDIA and AMD GPUs to power their increasingly large and power-hungry data centers are using the GPUs by the tens of thousands, linked into clusters and racks by the thousands. You are not a solution if you can’t deliver solutions at scale. AMD's technology is arguably better, at least for some applications. The company’s focus on memory capacity, cost, and efficiency makes it well-suited for some higher-intensity AI workloads and inference, which is where AI is heading. Inference is the application of AI technology, the deployment of models and their use by businesses and consumers, and it will eventually be the bulk of AI workloads. AMD's disadvantage was its inability to deliver rack-scale solutions effectively, but that’s all changed. Advanced Micro Devices has made great strides in fleshing out its AI stack, including the acquisition of ZT Systems and the Helios system. ZT Systems specializes in the development of designing and deploying AMD-based rack-scale solutions for data centers. Bringing it in-house allows AMD to provide an end-to-end, integrated solution based on Helios. Helios combines the soon-to-be-launched MI400 series with EPYC CPUs in an interconnected architecture geared for AI workloads. The platform is expected to be highly demanded by hyperscalers, including public, government, and commercial clouds. The forecast for 2026 is robust and includes an expectation for strength in all three of AMD’s critical segments. Already gaining market share in the datacenter CPU and PC segments, the analyst forecast significant market share gains compared to NVIDIA. Some suggest AMD could regain the share lost in 2023 and 2024 and then take more. The revenue and earnings forecasts are positive, with revisions in July and early August raising the consensus for sustained high-double-digit growth over the next five years. The critical detail is that the margin is expected to widen along the way, producing accelerated bottom-line growth and a deep-value relative to the long-term forecast. Trading at roughly 45x the current year’s earnings in mid-Q3 2025, AMD is trading at only 15x the 2035 forecast and could increase by 100% over the next ten years to trade in alignment with blue-chip technology peers. The analysts’ data reported by MarketBeat is bullish and aligns with the rising share price. The group rates the stock as a Moderate Buy. Coverage has been increasing, and the price target revisions are positive. Although the consensus implies the stock is fairly valued in early August, the revision trends lead to above $200, another 20% increase when reached. A move to $210 puts this market at a fresh weekly closing high, and a higher target may soon be set. The company has reportedly reached an accord with the White House, allowing it to resume sales of AI-related GPUs to China, a positive development for business and a catalyst for higher share prices.

YouTube to begin testing a new AI-powered age verification system in the U.S.,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/youtube-to-begin-testing-a-new-ai-powered-age-verification-system-in-the-us-2025-08-12/,"YouTube on Wednesday will begin testing a new age-verification system in the U.S. that relies on artificial intelligence to differentiate between adults and minors, based on the kinds of videos that they have been watching. The tests initially will only affect a sliver of YouTube's audience in the U.S., but it will likely become more pervasive if the system works as well at guessing viewers' ages as it does in other parts of the world. The system will only work when viewers are logged into their accounts, and it will make its age assessments regardless of the birth date a user might have entered upon signing up. If the system flags a logged-in viewer as being under 18, YouTube will impose the normal controls and restrictions that the site already uses as a way to prevent minors from watching videos and engaging in other behavior deemed inappropriate for that age. The safeguards include reminders to take a break from the screen, privacy warnings and restrictions on video recommendations. YouTube, which has been owned by Google for nearly 20 years, also doesn't show ads tailored to individual tastes if a viewer is under 18. If the system has inaccurately called out a viewer as a minor, the mistake can be corrected by showing YouTube a government-issued identification card, a credit card or a selfie. “YouTube was one of the first platforms to offer experiences designed specifically for young people, and we’re proud to again be at the forefront of introducing technology that allows us to deliver safety protections while preserving teen privacy,” James Beser, the video service's director of product management, wrote in a blog post about the age-verification system. People still will be able to watch YouTube videos without logging into an account, but viewing that way triggers an automatic block on some content without proof of age. The political pressure has been building on websites to do a better job of verifying ages to shield children from inappropriate content since late June when the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a Texas law aimed at preventing minors from watching pornography online. While some services, such as YouTube, have been stepping up their efforts to verify users' ages, others have contended that the responsibility should primarily fall upon the two main smartphone app stores run by Apple and Google — a position that those two technology powerhouses have resisted. Some digital rights groups, such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Center for Democracy & Technology, have raised concerns that age verification could infringe on personal privacy and violate First Amendment protections on free speech.","The tests initially will only affect a sliver of YouTube's audience in the U.S., but it will likely become more pervasive if the system works as well at guessing viewers' ages as it does in other parts of the world.","If the system flags a logged-in viewer as being under 18, YouTube will impose the normal controls and restrictions that the site already uses as a way to prevent minors from watching videos and engaging in other behavior deemed inappropriate for that age.","YouTube, which has been owned by Google for nearly 20 years, also doesn't show ads tailored to individual tastes if a viewer is under 18.","“YouTube was one of the first platforms to offer experiences designed specifically for young people, and we’re proud to again be at the forefront of introducing technology that allows us to deliver safety protections while preserving teen privacy,” James Beser, the video service's director of product management, wrote in a blog post about the age-verification system."
