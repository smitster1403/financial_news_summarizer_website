"Data centres poised for explosive growth, experts see opportunities in diversifying across ecosystem",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/data-centres-poised-for-explosive-growth-experts-see-opportunities-in-diversifying-across-ecosystem-13577401.html,"Data centres are emerging as the next big theme in India and are set for explosive growth over five years, with a Jefferies report pegging the capacity rising five-fold by 2030 to reach 8 Giga Watts on the back of $30 billion worth of capex. Leasing revenue is expected to surge five times to $8 billion, driven by rising internet traffic, growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and stricter data localisation mandates. Rising Capacity and Investment Surge A recent Kotak Institutional Equities report added to this optimism, forecasting India’s data centre market to quadruple by FY28, attracting $20-25 billion in fresh investments. Kotak said data centres may account for 4-5% of India’s total power capacity by FY30, creating tailwinds for renewable energy producers and grid infrastructure. It has projected a 25% CAGR in demand for specialised real estate, with Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad and Pune emerging as key growth corridors due to their submarine cable access and supportive state policies. The data centre boom is creating downstream opportunities across multiple sectors, including real estate ($6 billion), electrical and power systems ($10 billion), racks and fit-outs ($7 billion), cooling systems ($4 billion), and network infrastructure ($1 billion). Read More: India may grant 20-year tax exemption, GST credit to supercharge data centres: Report Telcos Well-Positioned to Benefit Telcos, accustomed to capex-heavy, long-gestation businesses are well-placed to benefit from this tailwind. In India, three of the top five data centre operators - NTT GDC, STT and Airtel Nxtra - are telco-owned. Bharti Airtel’s 15% market share, strong free cash flow and established enterprise client relationships position it well to capture this opportunity, according to Jefferies. Demand Fuelled by Digital Growth and AI The brokerage also noted that the surge in data traffic - 30x since FY17 - driven by internet and smartphone adoption, OTT platforms, digital payments and e-commerce, has fuelled demand for data centres. AI adoption is expected to further boost demand as AI servers require 5-6 times more power and liquid cooling than standard servers. Mumbai and Chennai, with proximity to sub-sea cable landing stations, account for 70% of colocation capacity, while top players dominate 90% of the market. Incremental capacity is expected to be led by AdaniConneX and Reliance Industries, the note said. Read More Diversify Across the Ecosystem So how should investors position themselves to capture this theme? Market expert Sunil Subramaniam told Moneycontrol that the key for investors is diversification across the ecosystem. “Don’t try to pick individual winners. Invest across the sector. Buy the story, diversify across telecom, power, infrastructure, and real estate, and ensure your portfolio captures the manifold benefits of this growth theme.” Read More: Data centre boom - $20-25 billion investment to take capacity to 4,500 MW by 2030 Opportunities Beyond Operators A Balasubramaniam, Managing Director and CEO of Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC too underscored the importance of looking beyond just data centre operators. “One of the sectors directly related to data centres is real estate. Second is power and third is the technology providers. All three form part of this opportunity, and they’re being captured by large companies with a focused push into data centres. A big beneficiary will be the power sector, because uninterrupted, high-voltage supply is critical for data centres to operate at speed without disruptions,” said ABSL’s CEO. Vinit Bolinjkar, Head of Research at Ventura Securities added a global perspective. “With India’s data centre capacity set to triple by 2030, backed by $25+ billion in investments, rapid AI adoption, and digitalisation, opportunities extend beyond traditional realty and infra, investors can gain exposure through companies like Anant Raj, Netweb Technologies, Black Box, L&T, and others such as E2E Networks, Tata Communications, and Adani Enterprises. In this capital-intensive sector, value creation hinges on business leverage, execution, and tenancy ramp-up, not just thematic positioning.” As the demand for data centres looks poised to grow exponentially, investors looking to ride the next big theme in India would do well to consider a diversified portfolio across this high-growth ecosystem, from renewable energy and power infrastructure to specialised real estate, telecom, and technology providers.

Tata Motors down 3 percent on fears that cyberattack hit may exceed JLR's FY25 profit,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/tata-motors-is-top-nifty-loser-on-feared-euro-2-billion-hit-from-recent-jlr-cyberattack-exceeding-fy25-profit-13577230.html,"Shares of Tata Motors were lower by over 3 percent in early trade on September 25, emerging as the top Nifty 50 and F&O loser after a report by the Financial Times said that subsidiary JLR may face a Euro 2 billion hit as it was not insured against a recent cyberattack that disrupted operations. The Financial Times report indicated that the hit on JLR could be higher than its entire profit of the previous fiscal. News agency Reuters quoted The Insurer, which cited cyber insurance market sources that the JLR had failed to finalise a cyber insurance deal - brokered by Lockton - leaving it likely uninsured for the attack. JLR has not yet commented on the reports. JLR UK Closure Jaguar Land Rover is extending factory closure until October 1 following a cyberattack in late August. ""We are working at pace to resolve global IT issues impacting our business. We will provide an update as appropriate in due course,"" Tata Motors had said on September 1. ""We have made this decision to give clarity for the coming week as we build the timeline for the phased restart of our operations and continue our investigation,"" JLR said on September 23. JLR has three factories in Britain, at Solihull, Halewood and Wolverhampton, which together manufacture about 1,000 cars per day. The company is losing £50 million ($68 million) every week, as per some news reports. Why JLR Matters During FY25, Jaguar Land Rover contributed 72 percent to Tata Motors' total automotive revenue, higher than its contributing in FY24, reflecting a higher growth trajectory of Jaguar Land Rover as compared to the Tata vehicles. Jaguar Land Rover's revenue increased in FY25 on account of better performance in North America markets. The employee costs at Jaguar Land Rover rose by 15.6 percent to Rs 36,887 crore (£3,417 million) in FY25 due to rise in headcount and annual increments. Cyberattack Fallout The situation has led to British business minister Peter Kyle and industry minister Chris McDonald visit JLR earlier this week to speak to the CEO about the impact. As of June, more than four in ten businesses in UK have had some form of cyber breach over the past one year, according to data cited by Reuters. “I fully recognise the anxiety and deep concern that employees at Jaguar Land Rover and across the supply chain will be feeling. The government and the National Cyber Security Centre will do everything in our power to help resolve this as soon as possible,” UK's Business and Trade minister Chris Bryant told the House of Commons last week. According to PTI News, a group calling itself 'Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters' is believed to have claimed responsibility for the hack. Setback for Tata Motors The cyberattack has led to disruptions at a time when Tata Motors has been seeing increased festive demand in India following the GST rate cuts. Tata Motors said it recorded 10,000 car deliveries and over 25,000 enquiries on the first day of Navaratri, marking a strong start to the festive season.","Why JLR Matters During FY25, Jaguar Land Rover contributed 72 percent to Tata Motors' total automotive revenue, higher than its contributing in FY24, reflecting a higher growth trajectory of Jaguar Land Rover as compared to the Tata vehicles.","Why JLR Matters During FY25, Jaguar Land Rover contributed 72 percent to Tata Motors' total automotive revenue, higher than its contributing in FY24, reflecting a higher growth trajectory of Jaguar Land Rover as compared to the Tata vehicles.","JLR has three factories in Britain, at Solihull, Halewood and Wolverhampton, which together manufacture about 1,000 cars per day.","Shares of Tata Motors were lower by over 3 percent in early trade on September 25, emerging as the top Nifty 50 and F&O loser after a report by the Financial Times said that subsidiary JLR may face a Euro 2 billion hit as it was not insured against a recent cyberattack that disrupted operations."

Asian Equities (Mixed) Asian stocks traded in a tight range at the open after losses on Wall Street as signs of fatigue crept into the AI-fueled equity rally. US Equities (Down) US stocks closed lower for a second straight session on Wednesday, as investors booked profits with indexes near record levels after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell flagged potentially stretched stock prices and ahead of a reading on inflation later in the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 171.50 points, or 0.37%, to 46,121.28, the S&P 500 lost 18.94 points, or 0.28%, to 6,637.98 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 75.62 points, or 0.33%, to 22,497.86.

However, on a year-to-date basis, except the Indonesian Rupiah, all other currencies gained up to 7 percent.

"Alibaba, Nvidia show market is instantly rewarding AI spending",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/alibaba-nvidia-show-market-is-instantly-rewarding-ai-spending-13576314.html,"The euphoria toward artificial intelligence is creating a strange kind of new math in the stock market: Plans for massive AI investments often lead to even larger increases in market value for the companies writing the checks. Take Nvidia Corp., which last week said it will buy a $5 billion stake in rival Intel Corp. and on Monday announced plans to invest up to $100 billion in ChatGPT creator OpenAI. The chipmaker added more than $320 billion in market value in the three trading days when the plans were announced — triple the amount the company is expected to spend under both agreements. Then on Wednesday, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s US shares jumped as much as 10% after the company said it would spend even more on AI than a $50 billion target set earlier in the year. While the total amount of additional anticipated spending wasn’t even announced, the news swelled Alibaba’s market capitalization by more than $35 billion. While massive corporate spending plans typically haven’t tended to be instantly rewarded in the stock market, these moves highlight that investors are still clamoring for all things AI and they are happy to keep piling into shares of companies spending big on data centers to position themselves as leaders in the space. The massive increases in market value come even as only a few companies have been able to show a material return on the investment in their financials. “The market is convinced that leadership in AI is going to take a lot of investment,” said Tejas Dessai, director of thematic research at Global X Management Company LLC. “And the market is also convinced that there are profits that can be earned out of this opportunity as long as you have the scale and the infrastructure to really service all this demand.” Other stocks that’ve seen a lift this year after pledging to spend more than $317 billion combined on AI include Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp, Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., whose gains account for a major part of the S&P 500 Index’s rally in 2025. The amount of value added to the companies this year far outstrips how much the group intends to spend: The four together have seen their market capitalization boosted by about $1.8 trillion. Oracle Corp. is another beneficiary of plans to boost spending on AI alongside high-profile partnerships with the likes of OpenAI, SoftBank Group Corp. and Meta Platforms as well as solid earnings outlooks that’ve charmed investors. The company is expected to spend $35 billion on capital expenditures in fiscal year 2026, and increase that amount to $65 billion by fiscal 2029. The stock has risen by more than 80% this year, adding nearly $390 billion to its market value. The market enthusiasm toward data-center builds comes despite mounting concerns that recent deals, such as the one between Nvidia and OpenAI, potentially signal a bubble due to the circular nature of the agreements: Nvidia is essentially investing in its customers. And with the biggest technology stocks making up a larger portion of the market than ever, the increased concentration risk could mean any downside pressure on them could spark a nasty move lower in benchmark indexes. Read More: Big Tech’s Market Dominance Stirs Debate on Concentration Risks “We are clearly in uncharted waters,” Louis Navellier, chief investment officer of Navellier & Associates, wrote in a Wednesday note to clients describing the concentration risk and the fact that the value of the US stock market is now more than double the size of the nation’s economy. ‘Bubble Environment’ The movement in Nvidia’s stock especially is “atypical market behavior that is representative of the bubble environment,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading, adding that the company’s $4.3 trillion market capitalization means that even small moves in shares constitute billions of dollars in value gained or lost. Still, bubble or not, many on Wall Street believe that the trend is likely to continue, at least in the near future. Investors have made it clear they have appetite for AI ambitions and the companies that are willing to spend big as an arms race of sorts emerges. While technological infrastructure investment has drawn skepticism in the past due to unfavorable outcomes such as the bursting of the dot-com bubble, there’s more support today for innovations that have already proven to be transformational. “The market has been super friendly to allow these companies to go on this investment spree, which again ties back to the story that the market really believes that AI presents a foundational opportunity not only for these companies but for the broader economy,” Global X’s Dessai said. “The biggest risk right now is underspending, especially if you are a category leader.”","“And the market is also convinced that there are profits that can be earned out of this opportunity as long as you have the scale and the infrastructure to really service all this demand.” Other stocks that’ve seen a lift this year after pledging to spend more than $317 billion combined on AI include Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp, Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., whose gains account for a major part of the S&P 500 Index’s rally in 2025.","“And the market is also convinced that there are profits that can be earned out of this opportunity as long as you have the scale and the infrastructure to really service all this demand.” Other stocks that’ve seen a lift this year after pledging to spend more than $317 billion combined on AI include Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp, Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., whose gains account for a major part of the S&P 500 Index’s rally in 2025.","The stock has risen by more than 80% this year, adding nearly $390 billion to its market value.","Read More: Big Tech’s Market Dominance Stirs Debate on Concentration Risks “We are clearly in uncharted waters,” Louis Navellier, chief investment officer of Navellier & Associates, wrote in a Wednesday note to clients describing the concentration risk and the fact that the value of the US stock market is now more than double the size of the nation’s economy."
Asian stocks dip after Wall Street rally stalls,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/asian-stocks-in-tight-range-as-global-rally-stalls-13576290.html,"Asian stocks slipped after losses on Wall Street as signs of fatigue crept into the AI-fueled equity rally. The Nikkei-225 index fell 0.2% with losses in Australia and Taiwan. The S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 and a gauge of global stocks all dropped for a second consecutive day Wednesday. A gauge of the dollar gave up some of its gains from the prior session while oil steadied following its biggest jump since July. Treasury yields were little changed after rising across the curve in US trading. An index of US-listed Chinese companies rallied against the downcast mood on Wall Street to climb 2.8%, with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. jumping 8.2%. Equity-index futures for Hong Kong retreated as the city returns to normalcy after Super Typhoon Ragasa. Insurance claims from the typhoon can be $50 million to $100 million, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Investors in Asia will also focus on the sale of 40-year Japanese government bonds Thursday. The retreat on Wall Street signaled a breather for an AI-driven surge that has already lifted the S&P 500 about 12% this year as investors rushed to names like Nvidia Corp. That momentum appeared to dissipate Wednesday as traders awaited fresh catalysts amid risks stemming from a labor-market slowdown to sticky inflation. “Timeout called,” said Craig Johnson at Piper Sandler. “The trend of strong gains isn’t over yet. However, the short-term risk-reward profile is becoming more compressed as stocks extend higher while underlying momentum fades.” Policy risks were also weighing on markets. The administration launched investigations into imports of robotics, industrial machinery and medical devices, a sign President Donald Trump may expand his tariff regime. South Korea’s prime minister warned that major investment projects in the US will stall until visa issues are resolved, urging Washington to reassure Koreans worried about detentions. Elsewhere, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President Mary Daly said further interest-rate cuts are likely needed, but the US central bank should approach those with caution. While the S&P 500 has defied September’s gloomy reputation as the worst month for equity returns, the gauge failed to gain traction on Wednesday, sparking concerns the rally has hit an air pocket. At Bank of America Corp., Savita Subramanian noted that on 19 of 20 metrics, the US equity benchmark is trading at statistically expensive levels. “In theory, investors pay up for predictable assets and are compensated for uncertainty. Perhaps we should anchor to today’s multiples as the ‘new normal’ rather than expecting mean reversion to a bygone era,” Subramanian at BofA said in a note. In commodities, copper prices soared after Freeport-McMoRan Inc. said force majeure was declared on contracted supplies from its giant Grasberg mine in Indonesia. Gold fell 0.7% Wednesday as oil climbed for a second day.","At Bank of America Corp., Savita Subramanian noted that on 19 of 20 metrics, the US equity benchmark is trading at statistically expensive levels.","While the S&P 500 has defied September’s gloomy reputation as the worst month for equity returns, the gauge failed to gain traction on Wednesday, sparking concerns the rally has hit an air pocket.","South Korea’s prime minister warned that major investment projects in the US will stall until visa issues are resolved, urging Washington to reassure Koreans worried about detentions.",The retreat on Wall Street signaled a breather for an AI-driven surge that has already lifted the S&P 500 about 12% this year as investors rushed to names like Nvidia Corp.

"Piccadily Agro wins injunction, Radico Khaitan barred from using ‘Kashmyr’ vodka brand",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/piccadily-agro-wins-injunction-radico-khaitan-barred-from-using-kashmyr-vodka-brand-13575273.html,"Listed sugar mill and distillery Piccadily Agro Industries has secured an court injunction restraining Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) maker Radico Khaitan from using the brand name 'Kashmyr' for its recently launched Vodka on grounds of trademark violation, a company filing said on September 24. Radico's brand name is ""deceptively similar/ infringing to the plaintiff's Trademarks ""Cashmir"", ""Cashmere"" and/or their variants,"" said the District Court of Karnal on September 23 in response to a petition by Piccadily Agro filed July 30, 2025. The suit was against Radico Khaitan's use of infringing mark ‘Kashmyr’ vodka brand which is similar to Piccadily's registered trademark ""Cashmir"" and ""Cashmere"". The court's interim injunction on Radico “restrained from manufacturing, selling, offering for sale, advertising and/ or promoting and/or using the mark ""Kashmyr"" in isolation and/ or in conjunction with any other prefix/suffix..."" Radico Khaitan and its affiliates have been restrained from manufacturing, selling, advertising, promoting, or using the brand until a final adjudication on the matter, said Piccadily Agro. Piccadilly had registered the trademark “Cashmere” in 2015 for a luxury vodka, subsequently secured a trademark for “Cashmir” too, and finally launched its first luxury vodka under “Cashmir” brand. Soon after its launch, Radico Khaitan in July 2025 launched a vodka under the brand “Kashmyr,” in the same category and similar price point. This is similar to the registered mark and likely to cause consumer confusion, Piccadily claimed. Piccadily had sought relief including a permanent injunction, restraining Radico Khaitan from using the trademark, as well as damages for unlawful use of the infringing mark, along with cost of the proceedings. The case is sub judice and a final adjudication of the matter is awaited. Recently, Jefferies initiated coverage on Radico Khaitan with a Buy call and said it expects it company to post strong double-digit annual growth in revenue, with significant potential for profit margin expansion. Jefferies also highlighted that India’s spirits industry is large and protected by complex state-level regulations, which create high entry barriers and give existing players a competitive advantage.","The suit was against Radico Khaitan's use of infringing mark ‘Kashmyr’ vodka brand which is similar to Piccadily's registered trademark ""Cashmir"" and ""Cashmere"".","The court's interim injunction on Radico “restrained from manufacturing, selling, offering for sale, advertising and/ or promoting and/or using the mark ""Kashmyr"" in isolation and/ or in conjunction with any other prefix/suffix...""

Outlook for September 25 Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities The downside momentum continued in the market for the fourth consecutive sessions on Wednesday and Nifty closed the day lower by 112 points. After opening on a weak note, the market showed volatility of intraday up and down swings for the better part of the session. An attempt of recovery of mid part has faltered and Nifty closed at the lows. A reasonable bear candle was formed on the daily chart with minor upper and lower shadow. Technically, this market action indicates weakness in the market with volatility. Though, Nifty placed at the lows of 4 days decline, still there is no indication of any reversal pattern forming at the lows. The short-term trend of the market continues to be negative. Nifty is now sliding down to the crucial lower support of 24900 levels (ascending trend line and 10week EMA) as per weekly chart. Immediate resistance is placed at 25150. Nandish Shah - Deputy Vice President, HDFC Securities Nifty fell for the fourth consecutive session with a fall of 112 points or 0.45%, to close at 25056. It turned out to be a volatile session for Nifty where both side swings were registered during the day with bears holding dominance at the end. Powergrid, Hindustan Uniliver, and NTPC emerged as the top gainers within the Nifty pack. On the flip side, it was a tough session for Tata Motors, BEL, and Jio Finance, which ended as the major losers. Cash market turnover on the NSE was lower by 10% compared to yesterday. The rupee emerged as the strongest performer among Asian currencies. It gained ground in the final hours of trading and closed higher by 6 paise against the greenback, driven by expected dollar sales from domestic banks. Sectoral performance reflected the overall weak sentiment, with all indices ending in the red, with the sole exception of Nifty FMCG. The sectors that faced the most significant losses were Realty, Auto, and Private Banks. The broader market indices continued profit booking for the third day in the row. The Nifty Midcap 100 Index fell by 1%, while the Nifty Smallcap 100 Index fell 0.70%. Market breadth remained weak for the third day in the row, with declining shares outnumbering advancing ones, as reflected in a BSE advance-decline ratio of 0.62. Nifty tested 20 DEMA support of 25042 during the session and managed to close slightly above the same. Sustainable level below 20 DEMA could drag index towards the next support of 24926, derived from 50% retracement of the entire rally seen from 24404 (29 Aug 2025 Swing Bottom) to 25448(18th Sep 2025 Swing Top). On the upsides 25150 and 25262 could offer resistance in the Nifty.

The key takeaways are as follows: Pantaloons is focusing on revamping its retail identity while focusing on improving margins by ~300bp over the next five years through improved SSSG and higher own-brand salience. The value retail format OWND! is breaking even on the store level and would be scaled up to 100 stores by the end of FY26, with an accelerated ramp-up from FY27. Designer-led ethnic brands are highly profitable (~20%+ margin). ABFRL’s target is to increase revenue contribution to ~INR20b from ~INR8b over the next few years, with further margin improvement to ~25%. The store rationalization and old inventory clearance in TCNS are largely behind, with store additions likely from 2HFY26. Management expects losses to reduce by ~50% in TCNS in FY26, with break-even targeted in FY27. Outlook We reiterate our Neutral rating on ABFRL with a revised TP of INR100, as we await improvement in execution towards consistent growth and sustained profitability before we turn more constructive on the stock.

Meanwhile, Novelis’s profitability has likely bottomed out, per our scrap spread workings; we expect margins to reset to normalized levels of ~USD480/t by FY28E. From a market perspective, after the ‘commodity supercycle’ sunset around 2012, if there was ever a time to own industrial metals, it is now, as we believe supply restraint alongside the macro tailwind of weak DXY provides an optimal position of strength (read: Grinding higher). To add to it, HNDL is relatively better placed among global peers to benefit from the improving dynamics. Firm aluminium prices should also help in adding duration visibility to earnings, resulting in a valuation re-rating.

"India considering to increase foreign holdings in PSU banks, says report; stocks surge up to 3%",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/india-considering-to-increase-foreign-holdings-in-psu-banks-says-report-stocks-surge-up-to-3-13573567.html,"The shares of Indian PSU banks jumped in trade on September 24, pushing the Nifty PSU Bank higher up to emerge as one of the top sectoral gainers. This comes after a report said that the Indian government is considering to increase the foreign investment limit in these banks. The Nifty PSU Bank index was up around half a percent, as seen at 11 am, bucking the overall downtrend in the market today. Earlier during the day, the index had risen around 1.6 percent to 7,567. Top PSU bank gainers: Indian Bank shares were the top gainers, rising nearly 3 percent, while Canara Bank shares were up nearly 2 percent. Indian Overseas Bank (IOB), Bank of Baroda (BoB) and Bank of India shares were up nearly 1 percent, while Punjab & Sindh Bank (PSB), Central Bank of India, UCO Bank and State Bank of India (SBI) shares were trading in the green with marginal gains. Dodging the trend, Union Bank of India, Punjab National Bank (PNB) and Bank of Maharashtra shares were trading in the red. Govt considering to increase foreign investment limit in PSU banks: Report The Indian government is considering to increase the foreign investment limit in public sector banks (PSBs) from the current 20 percent, the Economic Times reported citing people familiar with the matter. This comes as the Centre aims to transform these PSBs into institutions that can raise capital easily, the report added. The government however doesn't plan to reduce its stake below the 51 percent mark, ensuring the 'public' character of these banks remains intact, the report further said, citing a senior government official. It added that the government is examining how the shareholding and voting structure of PSBs can be relaxed without compromising their essential character and decision-making capabilities of their respective boards. Moneycontrol couldn't independently verify the report. Govt's stake divestment plans in 5 PSU banks: The government is progressing with its stake divestment plans through the Offer for Sale (OFS) route in five PSU banks. Bank of Maharashtra, Indian Overseas Bank, UCO Bank, Central Bank of India and Punjab and Sind Bank have been shortlisted for partial disinvestment in the coming months. Earlier this month, M Nagaraju, Secretary (FS), Ministry of Finance, said that most banks are very healthy now, posting record profits last financial year and having a low non-performing assets (NPA) ratios. Nagaraju is hopeful that PSU banks will report a record profit in the current financial year too. “There is no proposal to cut government stakes in PSU banks below 51%. We want to be the majority shareholder,” Nagaraju said at CNBC TV18's Banking Transformation Summit 3rd edition.",This comes after a report said that the Indian government is considering to increase the foreign investment limit in these banks.,"Indian Overseas Bank (IOB), Bank of Baroda (BoB) and Bank of India shares were up nearly 1 percent, while Punjab & Sindh Bank (PSB), Central Bank of India, UCO Bank and State Bank of India (SBI) shares were trading in the green with marginal gains.","Earlier this month, M Nagaraju, Secretary (FS), Ministry of Finance, said that most banks are very healthy now, posting record profits last financial year and having a low non-performing assets (NPA) ratios.","Govt considering to increase foreign investment limit in PSU banks: Report The Indian government is considering to increase the foreign investment limit in public sector banks (PSBs) from the current 20 percent, the Economic Times reported citing people familiar with the matter."
"Auto shares fall from record highs on profit booking; Ashok Leyland, Tata Motors decline up to 3%",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/auto-shares-fall-from-record-highs-on-profit-booking-ashok-leyland-tata-motors-decline-up-to-3-13573325.html,"Auto stocks came under selling pressure on Wednesday as investors booked profits after the recent rally, dragging the Nifty Auto index down by around 1 percent. The index had closed 0.6 percent higher in the previous session on expectations of improved margins during the festive season. Auto shares had rallied in recent weeks after cuts in goods and services tax rates. Analysts also turned positive on the segment expecting higher sales volumes, as most automakers passed on the tax benefits to customers. Bharat Forge in the Nifty auto index led the decline, slipping about 3 percent. Shares of Tata Motors, Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto fell up to 2 percent. Tata Motors-owned Jaguar Land Rover has extended the closure of its factories until October 1 following a cyber attack earlier this month. The production halt is estimated to have led to a loss of around 30,000 units, according to ICICI Direct Research. Ashok Leyland dropped 2.6 percent after Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock to ""neutral"" from ""buy"", citing limited upside following sharp gains since mid-August. Tata Motors had earlier said its dealers retailed about 10,000 passenger vehicles on the first day of Navratri and recorded over 25,000 customer enquiries nationwide. Maruti Suzuki reported retail sales of around 30,000 units and Hyundai around 11,000 dealer billings on Monday, the latter marking its highest single-day sales in five years. Robust festive demand had lifted sentiment in the previous session, with the Nifty Auto index rising nearly 1.5 percent intraday on September 23. However, selling pressure was seen on Wednesday in line with headline indices amid sustained foreign fund outflows and global concerns, including proposed changes in the US H-1B visa system.

"IT stocks extend slide as US proposes to change H-1B visa process; Coforge, Tech Mahindra lead losses",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/it-stocks-extend-slide-as-us-proposes-to-change-h-1b-visa-process-coforge-tech-mahindra-lead-losses-13573296.html,"The shares of IT companies dropped in trade on September 24 after the US President Donald Trump-led administration proposed major changes to the H-1B visa process. The Nifty IT index dropped around 0.7 percent to 35,009.70, as seen as 10.20 am. This is the lowest level seen by the index in nearly two weeks. Top IT losers today: Coforge, Tech Mahindra, Mphasis and Persistent Systems shares dropped around 2 percent each, while Wipro shares fell over 1 percent each. LTIMindtree, Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) shares were down around 0.4 percent each. Bucking the trend, HCL Tech shares were trading nearly 1 percent higher in the green. What has Trump administration proposed? President Donald Trump-led US administration has proposed to scrap the lottery system and replace it with wage-based selection process for allotting H-1B visas. The new proposal by the Department of Homeland Security aims at bringing in ""a weighted selection process that would generally favour the allocation of H-1B visas to higher-skilled and higher-paid aliens, while maintaining the opportunity for employers to secure H-1B workers at all wage levels"". The new process, if finalised, would give heavier weight to applications by employers who pay high wages if annual requests for the visas exceed the statutory limit of 85,000, the notice said as quoted by Reuters. The move aims to better protect Americans from unfair wage competition from foreign workers, it said. US to hike fee for fresh H-1B visa applications: This comes after Trump recently announced that the US will introduce a $100,000 fee for fresh H-1B visa applications, an unprecedented increase from the earlier fee range of $215-$5,000, depending on the company size. This move had earlier sent the IT stocks to a spin, after a brief rise following US Federal Reserve's rate cut. Notably, India was the largest beneficiary of H-1B visas last year, accounting for 71 percent of the approved beneficiaries, while China was a distant second at 11.7 percent, according to government data cited by Reuters. What analysts say? The proposal to scrap the lottery system and introduce wage-based selection process could hurt fresher hiring particularly, with startups and Indian IT firms seen as most impacted, says ICICI Securities. The brokerage believes Indian IT companies will partially mitigate it through offshore hiring, local hiring and near shoring. ""IT companies have reduced their dependence on H-1B visas in recent years via local hiring and nearshoring, and the moderation in fresh H-1B visas is a testimony to this. Expect further downtrend from CY25 base in the coming years, in our view. On-site presence is a client requirement, and we do not rule out negotiations by IT companies with clients to bear either partial or full incremental visa costs going forward. There is also a possibility of more offshoring hereon, as only mission critical resources will opt for H-1B. Our sensitivity analysis suggests 5.8%/8.4% worst case impact on earnings for mid-caps/large caps,"" said Elara Capital.

SN Subrahmanyan, Chairman & Managing Director, L&T said the collaboration with BEL is a 'significant leap' in its commitment to India's defence manufacturing. ""We are honoured to be working with BEL to deliver next-generation technologies for the Indian Air Force. Both the organisations are leaders in our respective domains and our combined efforts will play a crucial role in bolstering national security and advancing self-reliance in defence technologies.""

About AMCA The AMCA programme is aimed at developing an Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft, India’s indigenous fifth-generation, twin-engine, multi-role stealth fighter, through industry partnership - by DRDO's Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) - for subsystems, avionics, and other components. “Under the AMCA project, the plan is to develop five prototypes, which will be followed by series production. It is a key milepost in the history of the Make-in-India programme,” Defence Minister Rajnath Singh had said in May 2025 during the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) Annual Business Summit. The Cabinet Committee on Security had approved the fighter jet programme in 2024 with an initial development cost estimated at around Rs 15,000 crore. Some news reports had previously said that India will join hands with France under a government-to-government deal to jointly design and manufacture a new 120 kilonewton (KN) engine for the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA). The fifth gen fighter aircraft is being aimed to for an induction into IAF by 2036. Among the latest fifth generation fighter jets are the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor and Lockheed Martin F-35 (USA), Sukhoi T-50 PAK FA/Sukhoi Su-57 (Russia) and Chengdu J-20 (China). Year of Reforms The Ministry of Defence has declared 2025 as the ‘Year of Reforms’, with a focus on laying the foundation foradvancements in defence preparedness, and to transform the Armed Forces into a technologically advanced force capable of multi-domain and integrated operations. In light of the strain on global defence supply chains due to geopolitical conflicts, and Trump's tariffs, the cost for defence contractors have increased, leading to delays in production and maintenance. The government to keen to build a more resilient supply chain of products and components, with an emphasis on indigenisation. The Centre has set a target for domestic defence production at Rs 1.60 lakh crore for FY26 and Rs 3 lakh crore by FY29. The budget for Defence has seen an increase of around 4.5 percent FY26, taking the overall budget to Rs 1.80 lakh crore, of which Rs 1.49 lakh crore is planned to be spent on capital acquisition to modernise the forces. Rs 1.12 lakh crore have been earmarked for domestic industry, and about Rs 15,000 crore has been earmarked for R&D projects todevelop new technologies along with private industry.","Larsen & Toubro (L&T) and state-run Bharat Electronics (BEL), together under a consortium will be submitting an Expression of Interest (EoI) for the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA) programme in 'coming weeks' to support an indigenous 5th-generation fighter aircraft, a company statement by EPC and manufacturing major said on September 24.","Larsen & Toubro (L&T) and state-run Bharat Electronics (BEL), together under a consortium will be submitting an Expression of Interest (EoI) for the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA) programme in 'coming weeks' to support an indigenous 5th-generation fighter aircraft, a company statement by EPC and manufacturing major said on September 24.","Manoj Jain, Chairman & Managing Director, Bharat Electronics said, ""Our collaboration with L&T is a crucial step in realising this vision (of defence Atmanirbharta).","Year of Reforms The Ministry of Defence has declared 2025 as the ‘Year of Reforms’, with a focus on laying the foundation foradvancements in defence preparedness, and to transform the Armed Forces into a technologically advanced force capable of multi-domain and integrated operations."

Select shares from the shipping sector, namely SCI, GRSE and Mazagon Dock are sharply higher in anticipation of further push by the government which has been increasingly looking to boost shipping and shipbuilding activities in India, both for domestic market as well as for exports. Among the schemes that have been in the news recently are a shipbuilding fund worth Rs 20,000 crore, a Rs 25,000 crore Maritime Development Fund which was announced during the Union Budget, and a shipbuilding financial assistance scheme of Rs 25,000 crore. The MDF is expected to have government's contribution at 49 percent while the rest will be from port authorities, PSUs, financial institutions as well as the private sector. These schemes are aimed to providing incentives, interest subsidies, and long-term finance to boost domestic shipbuilding, ship-breaking and port-linked infrastructure. The government has also been pushing for the development of greenfield clusters and expansion of existing shipping hubs. As part of this, Cochin Shipyard (CSL) on September 23 signed an agreement with HD Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering (HD KSOE) for a collaboration in shipbuilding. CSL is also considering developing a Rs 15,000 crore shipyard in Tamil Nadu that will result the creation of 10,000 jobs. MoS for Ports and Shipping, Shantanu Thakur had recently said that the Centre is planning to develop more shipyards and is looking to target 5 percent share of global shipbuilding market by 2030. ""We are targeting a 5 percent share in the global shipbuilding market by 2030, a significant leap from our current position. This will be achieved through strategic investments in automation, digital twin technology and green shipbuilding innovations,"" MoS for Ports and Shipping had said on September 15 during a CII conference. The government plans to develop ""10 world-class shipyards by 2030, supported by public-private partnerships and international collaborations that will bring global best practices to Indian shores.""

With an initial corpus of Rs 25,000 crore, MDF will have government's contribution at 49 percent while the rest will be from port authorities, PSUs, financial institutions as well as the private sector.

Indian equities seen opening on a weak note; rupee hits record low,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/indian-equities-seen-opening-on-a-weak-note-rupee-hits-record-low-13572190.html,"Indian markets are set to open marginally lower on Wednesday, tracking soft cues from Gift Nifty. At 7 am, Gift Nifty was trading 40 points down at 25,200, a decline of 0.16 percent. On September 23, domestic benchmarks ended slightly in the red as worries over a steep hike in H-1B visa fees, persistent FII outflows, and uncertainty around India–US trade talks weighed on sentiment. A weak August PMI print, lower than the previous month, further dented investor confidence. The rupee slipped to a fresh record low of 88.7 against the US dollar, pressured by visa fee concerns and trade policy uncertainty. However, markets staged a partial recovery, aided by supportive factors such as GST reforms, robust auto sales on the first day of GST 2.0, a normal monsoon, and core sector growth in August rising to a 13-month high. The Sensex ended 0.07 percent lower at 82,102, while the Nifty slipped 0.13 percent to 25,197.50. Sectorally, Nifty IT, FMCG, and Defence indices fell up to 1 percent, while Auto, PSU Bank, and Metal indices gained up to 1 percent. Metal shares outperformed after the Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) proposed a five-year anti-dumping duty on imports of cold-rolled non-oriented electrical steel from China. Across Asia, equities slipped on Wednesday, echoing Wall Street losses after US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that “equity prices are fairly highly valued.” Powell added that the Fed faces a “challenging situation” and offered no clarity on the rate-cut trajectory. Globally, investors are awaiting Friday’s release of the US personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge. Traders are also watching developments in Washington as the risk of a government shutdown looms, with lawmakers yet to reach a deal ahead of the September 30 funding deadline.","The Sensex ended 0.07 percent lower at 82,102, while the Nifty slipped 0.13 percent to 25,197.50.","The Sensex ended 0.07 percent lower at 82,102, while the Nifty slipped 0.13 percent to 25,197.50.","Across Asia, equities slipped on Wednesday, echoing Wall Street losses after US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that “equity prices are fairly highly valued.” Powell added that the Fed faces a “challenging situation” and offered no clarity on the rate-cut trajectory.","However, markets staged a partial recovery, aided by supportive factors such as GST reforms, robust auto sales on the first day of GST 2.0, a normal monsoon, and core sector growth in August rising to a 13-month high."
First Tick: Top global cues to watch in today’s trade,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/first-tick-top-global-cues-to-watch-in-today-s-trade-7-13571808.html,"Indian benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty are likely to see a weak opening today, tracking GIFT Nifty, which was hovering around 25,203. Track the latest updates on GIFT Nifty right here on Moneycontrol. The Indian equity market ended flat with a negative bias on Tuesday, as gains in financials, autos, and metals were offset by losses in FMCG, IT, and select heavyweight stocks. Investors stayed cautious through a volatile session marked by currency weakness, FII outflows, and global policy concerns, even as selective buying in large banks, steelmakers and auto counters provided support. At the close, the Sensex was down 58 points or 0.07 percent at 82,102, while the Nifty 50 slipped 33 points or 0.13 percent to 25,170. Market breadth on the NSE remained weak, with 1,751 stocks advancing against 2,216 declining and 146 unchanged, reflecting broader selling pressure despite selective gains in large-cap names. Here is how financial markets across the globe fared overnight: GIFT Nifty (Slips) The GIFT Nifty is trading lower at around 25,203, indicating a weak start for the day. Asian Equities (Down) Asian stocks fell after Wall Street shares retreated as mixed signals from Federal Reserve policymakers clouded the path for interest-rate cuts. US Equities (Slip) US stocks finished lower on Tuesday, breaking a three-session string of record closing highs, as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the U.S. central bank needs to balance inflation concerns with a weakening job market in its coming interest rate decisions. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 88.76 points, or 0.19%, to 46,292.78, the S&P 500 lost 36.83 points, or 0.55%, to 6,656.92, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 215.50 points, or 0.95%, to 22,573.47. US Bond Yield (Down) The yield on 10-year Treasuries was down marginally at 4.1 percent, and 2-year Treasuries were down 2 basis points at 3.56 percent. Dollar Index (Flat) The dollar hovered near its weakest level in close to a week on Wednesday with traders expecting two more U.S. interest rate cuts this year, even after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell struck a cautious tone on further easing. Asian currencies (Down) Asian currencies were trading lower, with the Indonesian Rupiah leading the losers, followed by the Taiwan Dollar, Japanese Yen, Philippine Peso, Thai Baht, and Singapore Dollar. Crude (Up) Oil prices rose for a second day on Wednesday as an industry report showed U.S. crude inventories declined last week, adding to a sense in the market of tightening supplies. Gold (Flat) Gold traded just below a record after a three-day advance, as investors assessed a raft of commentary from Federal Reserve policymakers, including Chair Jerome Powell, and geopolitical tensions over Russia. Fund Flow Action The Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) extended the selling on the second day on September 23 as sold equities worth Rs 3551 crore, while Domestic institutional investors (DIIs) continued their buying in this month, as they purchased equities worth Rs 2670 crore on the same day.

Asian stocks edge lower after mixed Fed signals,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/asian-stocks-edge-lower-after-mixed-fed-signals-13572158.html,"Asian stocks retreated after a drop in big tech halted the S&P 500’s three-day rally, while mixed signals from Federal Reserve policymakers clouded the path for interest-rate cuts. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.2% at the open with declines in Japan, which returned after a holiday, Australia and South Korea. Equity-index futures pointed to a flat start for Hong Kong, where markets are due to open even as the financial hub braces for Typhoon Ragasa. Treasuries held their gains as Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned that risks persisted in both the labor market and inflation. He also reiterated that policymakers face a difficult path as they weigh further easing. “Powell doesn’t want to antagonize the White House but he’s not rolling over either,” said David Russell at TradeStation. “He’s keeping his options open in case price pressures increase. Powell’s not trying to sound hawkish, but he’s trying to dodge some of the forceful demand for aggressive cuts.” Fed officials lowered their benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point last week and penciled in two more reductions this year following months of intense pressure from the White House to slash borrowing costs. While most shares in the S&P 500 rose on Tuesday, the index slipped. A gauge of tech megacaps lost 1.6%. In late hours, Micron Technology Inc. gave an upbeat forecast. Oil extended gains early Wednesday on mounting risks to Russian supply, including strikes by Ukraine on energy infrastructure and heightened tensions with NATO. An index of US-listed Chinese companies fell 2.2% on Tuesday, its biggest loss in almost a month. In the US, some policymakers are becoming more concerned about growing risks to the labor market, while others remain primarily worried about the possibility that above-target inflation could be pushed higher by tariffs and other policies. Fed Governor Michelle Bowman said officials need to act decisively to bring down rates as the labor market weakens. Fed Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic said he sees more inflation coming, echoing remarks from his Chicago counterpart Austan Goolsbee. “While some hawkish Fed officials put a lot of weight on market developments and see this as a reason to be wary about cutting rates any further in the near term, this is not the way Powell and the core group think,” said Krishna Guha at Evercore. Prospects of further rate cuts, surprisingly strong profit growth and enthusiasm for Big Tech companies that are capitalizing on artificial intelligence have all kept equities near their all-time highs. The record-setting advance has pushed the S&P 500 nearly 3% above the average year-end forecast among those tracked by Bloomberg, which currently stands at 6,486. Only in 2024 and 1999 have the analyst calls lagged the market’s actual return so much around this time of the year. “The bull market in equities is ‘alive and kicking’,” said Craig Johnson at Piper Sandler. “While we maintain our bullish outlook over the intermediate- to longer-term, we also recognize that the SPX has advanced for nearly five straight months without a material pullback.”","“While some hawkish Fed officials put a lot of weight on market developments and see this as a reason to be wary about cutting rates any further in the near term, this is not the way Powell and the core group think,” said Krishna Guha at Evercore.","“While some hawkish Fed officials put a lot of weight on market developments and see this as a reason to be wary about cutting rates any further in the near term, this is not the way Powell and the core group think,” said Krishna Guha at Evercore.","Prospects of further rate cuts, surprisingly strong profit growth and enthusiasm for Big Tech companies that are capitalizing on artificial intelligence have all kept equities near their all-time highs.","“While some hawkish Fed officials put a lot of weight on market developments and see this as a reason to be wary about cutting rates any further in the near term, this is not the way Powell and the core group think,” said Krishna Guha at Evercore."

The market breadth remained supported by bears. About 1,591 shares declined against 1,181 advancing shares on the NSE. The market may see some more consolidation amid rangebound trading in the upcoming sessions. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Amol Athawale, VP Technical Research at Kotak Securities Union Bank of India | CMP: Rs 140.2 On the weekly charts, Union Bank of India is in a rising channel chart formation with a higher high and higher low series pattern. The stock witnessed a steady recovery from trendline support levels. Additionally, the technical indicator RSI is also indicating a further uptrend from current levels, which could boost the bullish momentum in the near future. For positional traders, Rs 135 would be the decisive level. Trading above the same, the uptrend formation will continue till Rs 150. However, if it closes below Rs 135, traders may prefer to exit from trading long positions. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 150 Stop-Loss: Rs 135 Jindal Steel | CMP: Rs 1,062.7 After the remarkable up move of the last few weeks, Jindal Steel witnessed consolidation near the resistance zone. However, after the upward rally, the stock comfortably closed above its breakout zone. The closing above its resistance zone on the daily scale suggests a bullish continuation chart structure and the up move is likely to persist in the coming horizon. For the next few trading sessions, Rs 1,025 could be the trend-decider level for the bulls. If it sustains above the same, we can expect a further uptrend towards Rs 1,140. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,140 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,025 Tata Motors | CMP: Rs 701.35 On the weekly scale, post-reversal from the lower levels, Tata Motors is currently in a phase of consolidation for the last couple of sessions. However, recent bullish activity near the demand zone is indicating good strength. The gradual up moves in the stock suggest a fresh leg of bullish trend in the near term. As long as the stock is trading above Rs 675, the bullish texture is likely to continue. Above which, the stock could move up to Rs 750. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 750 Stop-Loss: Rs 675 Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities Samvardhana Motherson International | CMP: Rs 112 The sharp upside momentum continued on Tuesday in Samvardhana Motherson after a small pause in the trend. The stock price has broken above the bullish flag/pennant-type pattern as per the daily timeframe chart. A bullish pattern like higher highs and lows is intact as per smaller and larger timeframe charts. Volume has started to expand during the upside breakout in the stock price, and the daily 14-period RSI shows a positive indication. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 124 Stop-Loss: Rs 105 Canara Bank | CMP: Rs 121.9 The PSU banking stock Canara Bank has been in a sharp uptrended movement over the last few weeks. We observe a decisive upside breakout of the hurdle of the downsloping trendline at Rs 115 levels on the weekly chart, and the stock price has closed higher. Volume has expanded recently during the upside breakout in the stock price, and the daily 14-period RSI shows a positive indication. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 135 Stop-Loss: Rs 115 NTPC | CMP: Rs 343 NTPC has been in a larger consolidation pattern over the last few months. The stock price has broken above the crucial resistance of the downsloping trendline this week at Rs 340 levels. This action is expected to be a decisive breakout of the larger consolidation pattern in the near term. The volume pattern and weekly RSI show a positive indication. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 375 Stop-Loss: Rs 325 Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors Hindustan Petroleum Corporation | CMP: 424.3 In the previous session, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL) managed to outperform its sector and gained 2.8 percent, which is a sign of strength in the ongoing trend. Since September 8, prices have managed to protect their prior day’s low on a closing basis, which keeps the daily bias on the side of the bulls. Along with this, the 15-period EMA (Exponential Moving Average) and 30-period EMA have recently witnessed a bullish crossover, which further reinforces a positive outlook for the stock. Additionally, MACD is now trading above the zero line with sustained green histograms above the zero line. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 435, Rs 450 Stop-Loss: Rs 407 Bank of India | CMP: Rs 121.43 Bank of India continued to make higher highs with each passing day, and in the previous session, the stock managed to close in green near the prior swing high of Rs 121.6 levels with a surge in volumes. On the daily chart, the stock, since July 2025, has been witnessing a rounding bottom formation, and currently it is trading near the neckline of the pattern, i.e., near Rs 122 levels. For now, a decisive break above it is required for a fresh rally to emerge on the upside. Also, ADX is trading at 31 levels, which suggests good momentum is likely to continue in the stock. The current trend for Bank of India is on the verge of a breakout. For now, a decisive break above the Rs 122 level can trigger a trending move towards Rs 127 followed by Rs 132 levels.

"Vodafone Idea shares rise up to 7% ahead of SC hearing on AGR plea, extend rally to 38% in 3 weeks",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/vodafone-idea-shares-rise-up-to-7-ahead-of-sc-hearing-on-agr-plea-extend-rally-to-38-in-3-weeks-13570713.html,"The shares of Vodafone Idea surged nearly 7 percent on September 23. The stock has now rallied around 38 percent in September so far as investors awaited Supreme Court's decision on possible relief from some AGR dues. Vodafone Idea shares hit an intraday high of Rs 8.97 apiece, the highest level seen by the stock in more than seven months. The stock later pared some gains to trade around 5 percent higher at Rs 8.79 apiece. Supreme Court set to hear telco's AGR relief plea on Friday The Supreme Court is set to hear the telco's challenge to a fresh Rs 9,450-crore adjusted gross revenue (AGR) demand from the Centre on September 26 (Friday). Centre earlier told the apex court, ""Not opposing Vodafone Idea plea, some solution is required, government is also an equity holder. Some solution may be required, subject to Supreme Court approval."" The case stems from the Court's March 18, 2020 order, which upheld AGR dues up to FY17 as calculated by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) and ruled out any reassessment by operators. The DoT had raised an extra demand on AGR dues worth Rs 2,774 crore for FY18-19. The petition said that out of the total Re 9,450 crore of demand, Rs 2,774 crore pertains to post-merger entity — Idea Group and Vodafone Idea — following their August 2018 consolidation, while Rs 5,675 crore relates to the pre-merger Vodafone Group’s liabilities. Vodafone Idea has contested the calculation, claiming that certain amounts have been added twice and need reconciliation. The company has asked for a recalculation of dues, starting from the pre-FY17 period. Citi calls Vodafone Idea a 'high-risk' buy Brokerage firm Citi called Vodafone Idea shares a 'high risk' buy, but set a target price of Rs 10 per share. This implies an upside potential of more than 19 percent from the stock’s previous closing price of Rs 8.39 apiece. According to the brokerage note cited by CNBC-TV18, Citi said the chances for a potential relief for the company have now increased. The shares of the debt-ridden telecom company had earlier seen significant plunge. The shares of the telecom company have surged around 47 percent in just six weeks after hitting a 52-week low of Rs 6.12 per shares, which they had hit in August this year. The stock is however still down around 25 percent from their 52-week high of Rs 11.94 apiece.

It has received in-principle approval to expand capacity a further ~200,000 tonnes. To support expanded operations, environmental clearance for its captive chrome ore mines at Sukinda and Mahagiri has been raised to 1.2m tonnes, with ore raising of 0.9m tonnes expected by FY28 and 1.2m by FY31 (PRC). Besides, levering the available land bank and bulk raw material handling infrastructure at Therubali, it is setting up a 120kL/day ethanol plant. This value-accretive diversification is expected to generate ~Rs3bn revenue yearly with an 8-10% EBITDA margin. >80% of demand for ferro-chrome, a key ingredient in stainless steel production, is driven by the industry. Demand in India for ferrochrome is expected to rise further as stainless steel consumption grows, backed by urbanisation, government initiatives to boost manufacturing and infrastructure, and greater demand from automotives, railways, etc. Outlook Considering IMFA’s fully integrated operations, ~0.1x leverage and high-teen return ratios, we initiate coverage with a Buy rating and a sum-of-parts TP of Rs1,510.

The company is rolling out new products and improving CPV via premiumization. The company’s 4W business (9% of topline in FY25) also should see a strong escalation on the back of strong order-book, improved technological capabilities through H-One acquisition, entry into Japanese OEMs and fresh ties with a leading Japanese PV OEM to reach 12-13% of topline by FY28. We believe increase in 4W share shall further improve the CPV and lead to re-rating of the stock. We anticipate Belrise to deliver ~34% PAT CAGR over FY25-28E as operating performance (13% EBITDA CAGR) is multiplied by de-leveraging impact. Outlook The planned and proposed transfer of related party entities should simplify group structure and thus be value accretive, adding to re-rating levers. Any occurrence of hiving off or reduction in the low margin Trading business would further drive profitability of the stock. We initiate with a BUY.

The recovery in credit cost, margins, and loan growth (led by festival demand and GST cuts) will aid earnings, while the transition to a universal bank provides a strong runway for growth. Deposit mobilization continues to remain healthy, with stable deposits forming ~79% of the total deposits. During 1QFY26, NIM contracted sharply to 5.4% but is expected to bottom out in 2Q and recover thereafter. AUBANK’s GNPA rose 19bp QoQ to 2.47% in 1QFY26; however, it expects stress to peak in 2Q. The bank has incurred 34bp of credit costs in 1Q, and we estimate 2Q credit costs to be ~30bp. This implies a sharp deceleration in provisioning expenses during 2H as management maintains its full-year guidance of 100bp. Outlook We estimate AUBANK to deliver 24% loan CAGR over FY26-28, which, coupled with improvement in operating metrics, will enable a 33% earnings CAGR. The recent correction in stock price has made the risk-reward favorable. Hence, we reiterate our BUY rating on the stock with an unchanged TP of INR875 (based on 2.8x FY27E BV).

"Auto shares in the fast lane on festive demand, Maruti hits 52-week high on Goldman Sachs' Buy call",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/auto-shares-in-the-fast-lane-on-festive-demand-maruti-hits-52-week-high-on-goldman-sachs-buy-call-13569052.html,"Signs of robust demand for two and four-wheelers have spurred shares of automotive companies, with the Nifty Auto index rising by nearly 1.5 percent on September 23, led by Maruti, Eicher, Tata Motors, M&M and Hero Moto along with consumer loan NBFC Bajaj Finance, thus cushioning the broader market weakness. Among F&O names, Ashok Leyland, Bajaj Auto, TVS Motor and Bharat Forge joined the ranks of top gainers. The momentum has ensured that all components of the Auto index were trading higher, barring one. Over the last 30 days, shares of ancillary players such as Motherson Sumi and Bharat Forge are higher between 10-15 percent, in ancitipation of the ruboff to their businesses. Early trends and dealer channel checks have showed that the first day of the festive sales during the ongoing Navratri season have seen a healthy demand, with Maruti, Tata Motors and Hyundai Motor India posting strong bookings following a subdued September due the Shradhh period during which fresh purchases are typically deferred. Brokerages Bullish Adding the momentum for Maruti was a bullish note by Goldman Sachs that has upgraded the stock Buy from Neutral with a target of Rs 18,900 per share, sending the shares to a 52-week high. In a separate note, Nuvama said the demand upcycle in the passenger car segment could continue up to FY29, helped by GST 2.0 with healthy demand expected across two-wheelers, tractors, and PVs. ""PV is at a mid to advanced stage of the upcycle. Average/maximum duration of upcycle as per historical data is six/eight years; hence, upcycle can continue up to FY27/FY29,"" said the Nuvama note. The brokerage attributed the momentum in automotive companies to GST cuts, new launches, the anticipation of benefit from the upcoming pay commission recommendation for government employees and hopes of another RBI rate cuts this year. Nuvama cited historical data that suggested upcycles lasting between 6-8 years to suggest that the current cycle in 2Ws could continue till FY30. Emkay Global quoted an automotive dealer from Western India who said that the tide may be turning for passenger cars after nearly two years of subdued growth. It quoted a 15-20% on year growth in bookings across segments so far in September for the region. The volume growth for October-December period is expected to over 20 percent, the dealer added. The automotive dealer told Emkay that the demand for electric 2Ws is expected to sustain even after the price gap with ICE bikes has narrowed following the GST cut, and said customers are willing to pay a premium for differentiated offerings. Trucks are seeing more value growth than volume growth as fleet operators are choosing to shift to higher tonnage vehicles to improve utilization, the dealer told Emkay Global. Read More: Maruti Suzuki's sharp price cuts may hit margin by 100 bps near term: Nomura Carmakers See Strong Demand Tata Motors has recorded 10,000 deliveries and over 25,000 enquiries on the first day of Navratri, in a sign of strong demand on the first day of the festive season. The management of Maruti said the company has had close to 30,000 bookings and 80,000 enquiries were registered on the first day of Navratri. Hyundai Motor India said the company recorded 11,000 dealer billings on September 22, marking its best day in five years. The management said it sees the demand sustaining ahead. Maruti has further extended the passthrough of GST benefits by cutting prices of entry-level hatchbacks in a strategic manner in an attempt to revive the small car segment. Maruti's current discount schemes are expected to continue till the end of September, over and above the price cuts. Tarun Garg, Whole-Time Director and COO of Hyundai Motor India said, ""The auspicious start of Navratri, amplified by the momentum from GST 2.0 reforms, has infused strong positivity into the market. On Day 1 alone, Hyundai Motor India Limited recorded around 11,000 Dealer billings, which is our highest single-day performance in the last five years"". The robust sentiment and customer confidence has prompted Hyundai to anticipate that the demand is expected to sustain. Tata Motors had in August said that it is 'hopeful' of the festive demand extending till December 2025, as was the trend during the last financial year. All segments of cars ranging from hatchbacks to luxury SUVs have become cheaper, with customers standing to save between Rs 40,000 and Rs 30 lakh on ex-showroom prices.

Asian stocks primed for best year against US peers since 2017,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/asian-stocks-primed-for-best-year-against-us-peers-since-2017-13568487.html,"Asian stocks will likely keep eclipsing their US peers, as a weaker dollar further raises the appeal of a region that has benefited from cheaper valuations and a momentous shift away from American assets, according to analysts. Also supporting the region’s equities are growing signs of easing trade tensions, especially between the US and China, where a months-long rally looks far from over. While the Federal Reserve’s latest interest rate cut was a given, it reinforced a bearish outlook for the US currency and opened up space for Asian central banks to loosen policy. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index has climbed 22% this year, beating the S&P 500 Index by around eight percentage points and set for the biggest annual outperformance since 2017. “We are tactically constructive on APAC equities’ relative performance in the remainder of the year versus US equities,” said Homin Lee, a senior macro strategist at Lombard Odier Singapore Ltd. A confluence of factors, from stable commodity prices to lower US rates and fading trade disruption should provide a decent backdrop for the markets, he added. The MSCI Asia gauge is trading at 16 times forward earnings estimates, below the S&P 500’s 23 times. Meanwhile, the Hang Seng Tech Index that jumped to a four-year high last week trades at around 21 times forward earnings, versus 27 times for the Nasdaq 100 Index, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. While the speed and magnitude of the Fed’s policy easing cycle remains uncertain, its rate cut last week was an extra boost to Asian currencies. Signals from the options market suggest traders are paying a premium to hedge against further strength in Asian currencies. Aggregates of risk reversals in the region, a measure of demand for options that pay out if the currencies strengthen against the dollar over various periods, have been in positive territory for months. “Given this backdrop we are increasing our exposure to non-US equities including Asian equities relative to US equities,” said Chang Hwan Sung, a multi-asset portfolio manager in Invesco’s investment solutions team in Hong Kong. The preference is mainly driven by a bearish view on the greenback and “US capital outflows seeking international diversification and foreign currency appreciation,” he added. To be sure, any inflation-driven pause on the Fed’s rate-cut cycle or even a hawkish policy pivot would easily reverse investor sentiment, while the US-China ties remain vulnerable to deterioration. Meantime, political uncertainties in Indonesia, Thailand and Japan are also in focus. But for now, there’s optimism that as US exceptionalism continues to draw skeptics, the appetite for Asian stocks will likely stay strong. “The U.S. remains the center of gravity for AI and corporate earnings power, but Asia offers distinct angles,” said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo Markets, citing “India’s domestic demand story, Japan’s banks amid Bank of Japan tightening, and selective China tech plays where policy support and monetization are starting to align.”","“We are tactically constructive on APAC equities’ relative performance in the remainder of the year versus US equities,” said Homin Lee, a senior macro strategist at Lombard Odier Singapore Ltd.

The session began on a volatile footing, weighed down by selling in IT counters amid concerns over a fresh us $100,000 H-1B visa fee. A mid-day rebound and relief from GST rate cuts provided some cushion, but persistent pressure from heavyweight stocks dragged the indices lower by the close. Sectorally, IT, pharma, and FMCG stocks bore the brunt of the decline, while energy and metals outperformed. Broader markets also lost ground, ending 0.5–1.0 percent lower.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Bajaj Finance, Tata Motors, United Spirits, BHEL, Cholamandalam Investment, Godawari Power, and others on September 23?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-bajaj-finance-tata-motors-united-spirits-bhel-cholamandalam-investment-godawari-power-and-others-on-september-23-13567886.html,"Equity benchmarks remained under pressure for the second consecutive session, correcting half a percent on September 22 with negative market breadth. A total of 1,790 shares were backed by bears, against 1,037 shares that were supported by bulls on the NSE. Rangebound trading may continue, and Monday's low could be crucial for further direction. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi UCO Bank | CMP: Rs 30.7 UCO Bank has recently confirmed the completion of Wave 2 on the weekly Elliott Wave structure, as highlighted in the chart, setting the stage for a potential Wave 3 rally. Supporting this outlook, bullish divergence is observed on both the MACD line and histogram, indicating improving momentum. Alongside this, a noticeable surge in volumes and a trendline breakout further validate the strength of the ongoing move. These technical signals collectively point to a favourable risk-reward setup. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 31–30 zone, with an upside target of 36. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 36 Stop-Loss: Rs 28 Hindustan Zinc | CMP: Rs 459.25 Hindustan Zinc has recently broken out of its consolidation range and is now trading comfortably above it, signalling renewed strength in price action. On the weekly chart, the stock has registered a bullish crossover on the MACD indicator, which typically indicates a shift in momentum in favour of the bulls. This technical setup suggests the possibility of a further upside move in the coming sessions. Sustaining above the breakout zone will be key for the continuation of the rally, while any dips toward immediate support levels may attract fresh buying interest. Overall, the trend looks constructive with a positive bias. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 460–450 zone, with an upside target of Rs 505. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 505 Stop-Loss: Rs 430 Sequent Scientific | CMP: Rs 203.59 Sequent has shown encouraging signs on the weekly chart, where a trendline breakout accompanied by a noticeable surge in volumes has been observed. This combination typically signals strong buying interest and validates the breakout’s reliability. Adding to the bullish outlook, the MACD has registered a bullish crossover just above the zero line on the weekly scale, which strengthens the momentum setup and indicates a shift in favour of the bulls. This alignment of price action with supporting indicators suggests that the stock may continue its upward trajectory in the near term. Overall, the technical structure remains constructive, favouring a sustained bullish move. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 204–200 zone, with a target of Rs 240. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 240 Stop-Loss: Rs 180 Jay Thakkar, Vice President & Head of Derivatives and Quant Research at ICICI Securities Bajaj Finance | CMP: Rs 1,006.5 Bajaj Finance has provided a breakout from a consolidation due to short covering, and it has been one of the best performers in the NBFC space in recent times. The stock is trading well above its 20-day VWAP (volume-weighted average price) of Rs 950, and it has just inched above its maximum pain level of Rs 1,000, so this is an immediate support range. The PCR (Put-Call Ratio) has jumped to 0.92 levels now, and the Rs 1,120 strike has the highest Call base, beyond which there will be a further round of up move. So, we advise buying Bajaj Finance Futures in the range of Rs 1,000–1,110. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,150, Rs 1,180 Stop-Loss: Rs 965 Tata Motors | CMP: Rs 696.25 Tata Motors has broken its critical support level of Rs 700 and closed below it as well, which is a negative sign in the near term. Overall, the stock has been an underperformer in its sector, and now it has closed below the 20-day VWAP level as well. Hence, the overall bias has turned negative for the stock. There have been significant Call additions at the higher levels from the Rs 700 to Rs 730 strikes, with the highest Call open interest at the Rs 720 strike. So, the risk-to-reward is quite favourable on the short side. We advise selling Tata Motors Futures in the range of Rs 694–698. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 675, Rs 665 Stop-Loss: Rs 710 United Spirits | CMP: Rs 1,339.9 United Spirits has witnessed a unidirectional fall from Rs 1,650 to Rs 1,280 with an increase in open interest, indicating short build-up, and now there has been a reduction in the open interest, indicating short covering. The stock price has, however, not bounced much, so there is more room left on the upside. The stock has witnessed Call unwinding at the Rs 1,320 and Rs 1,340 strikes; however, Rs 1,340 to Rs 1,400 strikes still have significant Call base, which may act as resistance. The stock has witnessed Put additions from the Rs 1,300 to Rs 1,340 strikes, so this range will act as support. This increases the probability of a retracement or a bounce-back in the last week of the September series due to short covering. So, we advise buying United Spirits Futures in the range of Rs 1,340–1,350. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,400, Rs 1,430 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,295 Vidnyan S Sawant, Head of Research at GEPL Capital BHEL | CMP: Rs 239.60 Bharat Heavy Electricals on the weekly scale has exhibited a bullish hidden divergence, aligning with the 61.80% Fibonacci retracement level and the 100-week EMA. From this confluence zone, the stock has formed three consecutive bullish candlesticks. On the daily scale, it is trading firmly above the key 12-, 26-, and 50-DEMA levels, underscoring strong trend strength. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 264 Stop-Loss: Rs 230 Belrise Industries | CMP: Rs 154 Since listing, the stock has maintained strong momentum with a higher-high, higher-low structure on the monthly scale. In the prior week, it hit a fresh lifetime high, breaking out of a four-week consolidation with strong volume support. On the daily scale, a base around the 26-day EMA highlights healthy price action, while the MACD in buy mode confirms sustained bullish momentum. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 171 Stop-Loss: Rs 147 Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Company | CMP: Rs 1,630 Cholamandalam Investment has been forming higher bottoms and recently established a base at the 50-week EMA, where the MACD has given a bullish crossover, indicating improving momentum. On the daily scale, the stock has broken its lower-top formation, suggesting continuation of the upward trajectory. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,825 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,548 Godawari Power and Ispat | CMP: Rs 263.6 On the weekly scale, GPIL has registered a decisive breakout above the December 2024 swing top, supported by strong volume activity, with volumes surpassing the 20-day average — a sign of robust participation behind the move. On the daily scale, the stock continues to trade firmly above its key 12-, 20-, and 50-DEMA levels, highlighting a well-established bullish trend and reinforcing the potential for sustained upward momentum.

While names like Groww, Zerodha, and Upstox feature among the top broking firms, data from the IPO documents of Groww and Anand Rathi have now revealed that the cumulative share of discount broking firms has more than doubled in the last five years. According to data disclosed in the draft documents of Groww and Anand Rathi Share & Stock Brokers, the total share of discount broking firms has jumped to nearly 80% from just around 38-40% in FY20. Incidentally, this share — in terms of the number of active clients — was merely 7-8% around 10 years back in FY15. More importantly, going ahead, the broking industry in India, which was estimated to be valued at around Rs 450 billion in FY24, is expected to grow at a CAGR of 16-18% and reach a size of Rs 850 billion by FY28, as per the DRHP of Anand Rathi Share & Stock Brokers.

As per the proposal disruptions caused by global cloud service providers, glitches at market infrastructure institutions (MIIs), delays in KYC processing, back-office issues not affecting trading, payment gateway failures at banks or aggregators, and problems in decision-support tools such as charts or reports will not be counted as technical glitch. Sebi has issued a draft circular on the same and has sought public feedback on the same by October 2, 2025. The revised definition of technical glitch is expected to bring more clarity and ease the compliance. Through Sebi has not changed the 5-minute time interval for consideration as a technical glitch. Sebi draft circular said, “Technical glitch shall mean any malfunction in the electronic system of stock broker, including malfunction in its hardware, software, networks/bandwidth, processes or products or services, directly or indirectly related to trading and risk management, occurred during trading session of stock exchange. The malfunction in the systems of stock brokers or the one outsourced from any third parties, which may lead to either stoppage, slowing down or variance in the trading and risk management functions such as log-in, order placement (including modification, cancelation, execution, confirmation, status), allocation and viewing of margin/ collateral/ funds etc., for a contiguous period of five minutes or more.” Moneycontrol had reported on June 26 that brokers have requested exchanges and Sebi to further ease the technical glitch reporting norms, seeing the practical difficulties. Sebi had issued a framework in December 2022 and after the inputs from industry exchanges had issued revised circular in March this year. Sebi paper said,” Sebi received several representations from the various stakeholders and Industry forum regarding need to review the present framework on technical glitches. The feedback received from the stakeholders, stock exchanges and data on the technical glitches were discussed in Stock brokers ISF and their recommendations were analysed”. Sebi paper further said, “Based on the feedback and the analysis of data, it has been decided to review extant framework of technical glitches at stock broke systems”. The framework will apply only to brokers offering internet-based or securities trading through wireless technology (IBT/STWT) platforms with more than 10,000 clients. This effectively exempts around 457 smaller brokers, easing their compliance burden given their limited technology exposure. Rationalization of reporting of technical glitch to Stock Exchange is proposed to be eased considering reasonable time require to report and considering trading holidays etc. Further, reporting is proposed to be done at the Common Reporting platform to avoid the multiple reporting by stock brokers. Reporting norms have also been streamlined. Brokers must notify exchanges and clients about glitches within two hours and file a preliminary incident report by the next trading day. A root cause analysis must follow within 14 days. All reports will be routed through a common platform, Samuhik Prativedan Manch, to avoid duplication. Sebi has also proposed that financial disincentive will also be rationalised. The regulator has also proposed rationalisation of financial disincentives. Minor glitches or those affecting only one mode of trading (mobile or web) while the other remains functional will not attract penalties. Exchanges, in consultation with Sebi, will issue detailed guidelines. Also read: Market participants seek protocol after September’s last-minute holiday change shook the settlement system Sebi has emphasised that brokers must undertake robust capacity planning and rigorous testing of software changes to prevent disruptions. Exchanges will continue monitoring systems through the API-based Logging and Monitoring Mechanism (LAMA). Disaster recovery and business continuity norms are also being reviewed. The proposed changes aim to balance investor protection with operational ease for brokers, as rising investor participation continues to test the resilience of trading platforms.

Click to View More Outlook for September 23 Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The Nifty has been witnessing a pullback over the last two days, which is absolutely normal considering the 1,000-point rally that preceded it. In fact, such minor corrections are healthy for a sustained uptrend. In the short term, support is placed at 25,050, and the overall structure remains intact as long as the index holds above this level. A decisive break below 25,050 could extend the correction towards 24,800. On the upside, resistance is seen at 25,250. A move above this level could signal a resumption of the uptrend. Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities Nifty continued to slide down for the second consecutive sessions on Monday and closed the day lower by 124 points amidst volatility. After opening with a downside gap of 89 points, the market showed quick recovery from the lows and filled the opening down gap in the early part of the session. Nifty was unable to sustain the recovery and declined again in the mid to later part of the session and closed near the lows. A reasonable negative candle was formed on the daily chart with gap down opening and with long upper shadow. Technically, this market action indicates continuation of short-term downward correction in the market with sell on rise. Medium to long-term trend of Nifty remains positive and the current weakness could be a buy-on-dips opportunity for the short term. Nifty is expected to find support around 25000 levels and is likely to bounce back from the lows. Immediate resistance is placed at 25450.
