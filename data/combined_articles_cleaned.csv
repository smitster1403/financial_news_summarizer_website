Revenue exceeded our estimate by 12%, led by a 23% beat in revenue from the distribution of financial products, while MF revenue was in line. Opex rose 5% YoY/12% QoQ to INR1.5b in 1QFY26, driven by a 6% YoY increase in employee costs, while other expenses grew 3% YoY. Improved operational efficiency resulted in EBITDA of INR1.3b, up 30% YoY/41% QoQ, with EBITDA margin expanding to 46.6% from 41.3% in 1QFY25. 1Q PAT grew 28% YoY to INR939m (35% beat), driven by better-thanexpected revenue. PAT margin expanded by 335bp YoY to 34.3% (est. 28.5%). The company is on track to meet its FY26 guidance, as it has already achieved 25% of its full-year PAT target and 24% of its revenue target in 1QFY26. It is also just 14% short of reaching its INR1t AUM goal. Outlook We expect a CAGR of 24%/22%/28% in AUM/revenue/PAT during FY25- 27E, with robust cash generation (INR9.2b of OCF during FY25-27E), RoE of 40%+, and a healthy balance sheet.

""...on 11 July 2025 CESTAT pronounced an order in favour of the Company rejecting the appeals of MSTD for the period of 9 years i.e. from 2007-08 to 2015-16 and for 2017-18,"" the lubricant maker said on July 11. The clarity in the tax case has supported investor interest in the shares, which is higher on volumes that are 4x the one-month average. Over the last one year, the shares are down by 9 percent but on a YTD basis the shares are higher by 15 percent. In 2023, the shares of Castrol India were higher by 46 percent. Castrol India has not made any provision in its books for the amount involved in the dispute i.e. Rs 4,131 crore, since the likelihood of an economic outflow was 'considered as remote', the company said, citing that there have been decisions of tribunal / courts in favour of industry in such cases, supporting Castrol India's position. ""The Company’s tax payment methodology in respect of the goods sold is adequately supported by robust legal grounds/precedents and in Company’s opinion the said demands are unjustified. Thus considering the favourable orders from MVAT Tribunal and based on the legal advice the Company has not made any provision in the books for the year ended December 31, 2024 and the possibility of outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is considered to be remote,"" Castrol India had said in its annual report in FY24. The company had received demand orders amounting to Rs 4,131 crore for the period 2007-08 to 2017-18 (10 years) from the MSTD over movement of goods from its warehouses in Maharashtra to Clearing and Forwarding Agents (CFAs) in other states. The MSTD had alleged that such movements of goods constituted inter-state sales to pre-existing customer orders in destination states. Castrol India contested these claims of MSTD, and said that the goods were not dispatched under any prior customer orders and the company’s tax payments on the goods were valid. The company had received favor order from the MVAT tribunal in the case, however, the MSTD appealed before the CESTAT against the orders for 9 out of 10 years. On July 11, 2025 CESTAT in an order ruled in favour of Castrol India, rejecting the tax department's appeal. Castrol India had on July 7 announced the appointment of Mrinalini Srinivasan as its new Chief Financial Officer, effective 28 July, 2025.","Shares of Castrol India are higher by nearly 4 percent on July 14, after the company said in an exchange filing that the Customs Excise & Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (CESTAT) has ruled in its favour, in a Rs 4,131 crore tax dispute with the Maharashtra Sales Tax Department (MSTD).","Shares of Castrol India are higher by nearly 4 percent on July 14, after the company said in an exchange filing that the Customs Excise & Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (CESTAT) has ruled in its favour, in a Rs 4,131 crore tax dispute with the Maharashtra Sales Tax Department (MSTD).",The MSTD had alleged that such movements of goods constituted inter-state sales to pre-existing customer orders in destination states.,"Thus considering the favourable orders from MVAT Tribunal and based on the legal advice the Company has not made any provision in the books for the year ended December 31, 2024 and the possibility of outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is considered to be remote,"" Castrol India had said in its annual report in FY24."

Track the latest updates on GIFT Nifty right here on Moneycontrol. Bears tightened their hold on Dalal Street as benchmark indices witnessed their biggest fall in 10 months on April 7, after US reciprocal tariffs sparked fears of a trade war and a recession, denting investor sentiments worldwide. At close, the Sensex was down 2,226.79 points or 2.95 percent at 73,137.90, and the Nifty was down 742.85 points or 3.24 percent at 22,161.60. The selloff eroded investors' wealth by more than Rs 12 lakh crore, as the market capitalization of BSE-listed companies slipped to Rs 390 lakh crore from Rs 403 lakh crore in the previous session. Here is how financial markets across the globe fared overnight: GIFT Nifty (Up) The GIFT Nifty is trading higher at around 22,658.50, indicating a firm opening for the day. Asian Equities (Up) Asian stocks bounced back after the worst day on record, snapping a global slump sparked by concerns that President Donald Trump’s trade war will hurt economic growth. US Equities (Mixed) Most major stock indexes ended a turbulent Monday lower as U.S. President Donald Trump showed no sign of easing up on his global trade war, while US Treasury yields rebounded. The European Union proposed counter-tariffs on Monday, while Trump threatened to add another 50% duty on U.S. imports from China on Wednesday if it did not withdraw its 34% retaliatory tariffs from last week. US stocks swung between heavy losses and gains throughout the session as investors digested changing headlines related to tariffs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 349.26 points, or 0.91%, to 37,965.60; the S&P 500 dropped 11.83 points, or 0.23%, to 5,062.25; and the Nasdaq Composite rose 15.48 points, or 0.10%, to 15,603.26.

Asian currencies (Down) Asian currencies were trading mostly lower in the early Tuesday trade with the Indonesian Rupiah down the most followed by the China Renminbi, Malaysian Ringgit, Thai Baht, Taiwan Dollar Crude (Down) Oil prices rose more than 1% on Tuesday, rebounding after a hefty selloff in recent sessions led by concerns that U.S. tariffs might depress demand and lead to a global recession. Gold (Up) Gold was steady as fears that US President Donald Trump’s trade war could risk a global economic downturn drove haven demand, signaling a pause in the selloff of the asset in recent days. Fund Flow Action The Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) continued their selling on the sixth day on March 7, with selling equities worth Rs 9040 crore, however, Domestic institutional investors (DIIs) turned into net buyers as they bought equities of Rs 12122 crore on the same day.

Wall Street equities have been hammered since Trump's sweeping tariffs, announced late Wednesday, on all imports into the U.S. and much higher levies on some major trading partners. Trading volume on Monday broke U.S. records for the second session in a row. In early trade, all three major U.S. indexes touched their lowest levels in more than a year. In the morning, they briefly rallied sharply on a report about tariffs, only to fall again after the report was knocked down. Also during the session, the CBOE Volatility Index, Wall Street's fear gauge, breached 60 points, hitting its highest level since August 2024. After paring gains it still ended the day at 46.98, its highest close in five years. ""The underlying problem of the market is that the administration's approach to trade imbalances is to try a cure that's worse than the disease,"" said Rick Meckler, partner, Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey. ""It's clear that investors favor either a pause or a different look at how to do this. It's very telling that of the many Trump supporters in the investment and business community, it doesn't look like there's anybody stepping up and endorsing the administration's approach to tariffs.""

In the first two days following Trump's tariff announcements last week, the benchmark S&P 500 index had dived 10.5% and lost about $5 trillion in market value for its biggest two-day loss since March 2020. On Friday, the blue-chip Dow confirmed it was in a correction, or more than 10% below its December record close while the Nasdaq confirmed it was in a bear market, defined as a decline of 20% or more below its record close. In Monday morning trading, the S&P 500 had fallen 20% below its record closing high. The index briefly rallied more than 3%, after a news report said Trump was considering a 90-day pause on tariffs. White House officials quickly denied the report, sending the market back into the red. Meckler said the market's wild swings on Monday left investors ""a little bit concerned that if facts start to change, you could see a very rapid rise to this market."" ""It's leading to this back-and-forth movement of rallies that are effectively being sold and drops in the market where people are covering shorts or trying to find a place to buy."" Real estate lost 2.4%, the biggest percentage decliner among the S&P's 11 major industry indexes on Monday. Communications services, was the biggest gainer, finishing up 1%.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bajaj Finance, GMR Airports, Chambal Fertilizers, PNB Housing, and others on April 8?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-kotak-mahindra-bank-bajaj-finance-gmr-airports-chambal-fertilizers-pnb-housing-and-others-on-april-8-12987972.html,"The benchmark indices nosedived sharply and closed with a 3 percent decline after recouping around 2 percent from the day's low, tracking tariff-led turmoil in global peers. The market breadth was dismal, with a total of 2,448 shares trapped in a bear market, compared to just 193 shares that outperformed. The trend is expected to remain favourable for bears, but some rebound can't be ruled out, considering the significant fall in the past few days. Below are some trading ideas for the near term: Jay Thakkar, Vice President & Head of Derivatives and Quant Research at ICICI Securities Kotak Mahindra Bank | CMP: Rs 2,037.85 Kotak Mahindra Bank has been one of the outperformers in the Nifty private sector banks, and the uptrend has been largely due to short covering. The stock has provided a breakout from a range lasting more than 3 years, which is quite significant. It is one of the few stocks in the current scenario trading near its all-time high levels, reflecting relative outperformance. Due to the heavy sell-off in the markets during the last trading session, the stock witnessed Put unwinding at almost all the strikes. However, it didn’t see much short addition from current levels; rather, the stock bounced back from lower levels. Based on these observations, the probability of the stock holding onto the Rs 2,000 levels—its second-highest Put open interest—is quite high, at least on a closing basis. Below that, there is another critical support level at Rs 1,960. Therefore, the risk-reward is favourable on the long side. So, buy Kotak Mahindra Bank in the range of Rs 2,000 to Rs 2,040. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,120, Rs 2,200 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,960 Bajaj Finance | CMP: Rs 8,568 Bajaj Finance has also witnessed a huge range breakout—a consolidation breakout lasting more than 3 years—and the short covering is still pending. Since the prices have fallen back to the level from where it broke upwards, there is a higher probability of short covering, as the stock has not seen a significant short build-up in the recent fall from the top. While there was Put unwinding at most strikes, additions were seen at the Rs 8,400 strike. Hence, the range of Rs 8,500 to Rs 8,400 is very critical in the near term, while Rs 9,000 is an immediate hurdle, making it the first target due to the highest Call open interest. So, buy Bajaj Finance in the range of Rs 8,550 to Rs 8,650. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 9,000, Rs 9,200 Stop-Loss: Rs 8,220 SRF | CMP: Rs 2,715.2 SRF has also outperformed the overall markets recently. There has been a breakout from a huge consolidation due to sharp short covering. Although some fresh short additions were seen in the recent fall, the prices have reversed from the breakout point, making the risk-reward favourable on the long side. The Rs 2,700 strike Put has the highest open interest, while the Rs 3,000 strike Call has the highest open interest. So, the range to watch is Rs 2,700 to Rs 3,000, and since the stock is near the lower end of the range, the bulls have a favourable chance from hereon. Buy SRF in the range of Rs 2,700 to Rs 2,650. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,900, Rs 3,000 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,550 Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi Zomato | CMP: Rs 209.63 Despite a sharp market-wide correction, Zomato outperformed, closing with only a marginal loss. The stock is forming multiple bottoms near the Rs 195 level, indicating strong support. Traders may consider entering long positions near Rs 205, with a stop-loss at Rs 195 and an upside target of Rs 225. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 225 Stop-Loss: Rs 195 GMR Airports | CMP: Rs 82.22 Unlike most F&O stocks, GMR Airports ended with gains in an otherwise volatile market. The stock witnessed a breakout above Rs 80, followed by a sharp pullback, and has now resumed its upward move. This price action suggests renewed strength and presents a potential buying opportunity. Traders may consider entering long positions near Rs 80, with a stop-loss at Rs 76 and an upside target of Rs 88. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 88 Stop-Loss: Rs 76 Anshul Jain, Head of Research at Lakshmishree Investments Chambal Fertilizers and Chemicals | CMP: Rs 612.8 Chambal Fertilizers, after breaking out of a rectangle pattern at Rs 546, offered no buying dips—until today. The stock has now smartly defended its 10–20 day moving average zone, giving short-term traders a golden entry into the momentum. Today’s bullish candle hints at renewed buying interest, supported by the cooling off of previously overheated momentum indicators. With the trend intact and structure strong, Chambal Fertilizers looks poised to clock fresh all-time highs in the coming sessions. Traders should watch for continued strength above support to ride the next leg up. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 700 Stop-Loss: Rs 580 PNB Housing Finance | CMP: Rs 923.65 PNB Housing Finance has defended its rounding bottom breakout impressively, even amid a falling market, with volumes consistently above the 50-day average, signaling strong institutional accumulation. For the bullish momentum to persist, the stock must hold above Rs 940. A sustained move above this level will likely lead to an initial target of Rs 1,050. The volume profile throughout the entire pattern reflects accumulation by strong hands, suggesting confidence in the stock’s long-term potential and positioning it as a frontrunner once market sentiment improves. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,050 Stop-Loss: Rs 880 Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

"Wall Street trades lower as Trump threatens China with steeper tariffs, markets near bear territory",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/wall-street-trades-lower-as-trump-threatens-china-with-steeper-tariffs-markets-near-bear-territory-12987885.html,"Wall Street's main indices continued to trade firmly lower albeit off lows as investors grappled with growing fears of a prolonged trade war and a White House unwilling to blink. Fears deepened as President Trump doubled down on his hardline trade stance, threatening even steeper tariffs on China — a move that escalated an already fraught standoff and pushed US markets closer to bear territory. Also read: India well poised to take advantage of current situation: Piyush Goyal on market upheaval from Trump's tariffs The S&P 500 shed 0.8 percent, now down nearly 20 percent from its February peak — the threshold that typically signals a bear market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 988 points, or 2.6 percent, following two historic 1,500-point declines last week. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.6 percent and is now 24 percent below its record high, with tech stocks once again leading losses. Markets saw a brief bounce at the open on hopes that the White House might consider delaying the sweeping tariff hikes that went into effect over the weekend. But that optimism was short-lived. The administration dismissed talk of a 90-day pause as “fake news,” triggering a sharp reversal. Over the weekend, Trump defended the policy, comparing it to ""medicine"" needed to fix systemic trade imbalances. On Monday, he issued a fresh warning to China on social media, threatening to slap a 50 percent tariff unless Beijing rolled back its retaliatory measures by April 8. Talks, he added, would be suspended if China failed to comply.

They are going to stay in place for days and weeks.” The sheer scale and speed of the tariff rollout has stunned investors. Rates have been applied across dozens of trade partners without the usual economic justifications. China, instead of seeking negotiations, retaliated immediately with a 34 percent levy on all US imports. With the administration showing little appetite for compromise, Wall Street is now pricing in a long, messy trade war. The market rout is also raising fears of forced selling, as funds scramble to raise cash to meet margin calls. The CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, spiked to 50 on Monday — a level typically associated with extreme market stress. The sell-off spilled into other asset classes. Bitcoin dropped below $77,000, oil prices fell under $60 a barrel, and volatility surged. European markets slumped for a fourth straight session on Monday, caught in the global equity rout sparked by President Trump’s aggressive new tariff regime. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index dropped as much as 6 percent before trimming losses to end 4.54 percent lower. France’s CAC 40 tumbled 4.8 percent, Germany’s DAX shed 4.26 percent, and the UK’s FTSE 100 declined 4.4 percent, as fears of an escalating trade war and a prolonged downturn continued to rattle investor nerves.

"Futile to predict future, stick to asset allocation dharma, says Kotak's Nilesh Shah amid market turmoil",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/futile-to-predict-future-stick-to-asset-allocation-dharma-says-kotaks-nilesh-shah-amid-market-turmoil-12987853.html,"The market, caught in the crossfire of an unpredictable tariff war, is struggling to find its footing. Every fresh development triggers a reaction, and the uncertainty has left sellers in an aggressive mood while buyers are hesitant to commit. ""It’s futile to predict how events will unfold,"" said Nilesh Shah, Managing Director of Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company. ""What investors can do is stick to their asset allocation dharma."" According to Shah, large-cap stocks are fairly valued and deserve a neutral allocation. But any correction should be seen as an opportunity. ""Buy gradually as markets turn cheaper. That’s how you position to be overweight equities,"" he advised. Amid the global noise, Shah believes domestic stories hold promise—especially sectors like cement, building materials, and consumer discretionary, which offer strong long-term potential. He pointed to several tailwinds supporting consumption: tax rebates announced in the budget, reduced EMI burdens thanks to falling interest rates, a likely dip in oil prices, and the expected rollout of the eighth pay commission next year. Indian equities witnessed a massive bloodbath in today's session. Dalal Street went into a freefall on April 7, as panic-selling took the benchmark indices sharply lower. Triggered by Donald Trump’s tariff tantrum on Wall Street, a wave of global jitters wiped out a jaw-dropping Rs 16 lakh crore in market value — the sharpest intraday collapse since June 2024. Inflation fears, a looming consumption crunch, and recession fears had investors running for cover as the Nifty and Sensex plunged deep into the red. India VIX — the fear gauge of the domestic market — soared as much as 66 percent to 22.85 on April 7, marking its sharpest intraday spike since June 4, 2024, according to Bloomberg data. The dramatic surge has completely erased the downtrend that had been in place since the latter half of January this year.

Meanwhile, domestic institutions stepped in with their heftiest buying since February 28, 2025—stacking up stocks worth Rs 12,122 crore. During the trading session of April 7, FIIs bought shares worth Rs 13,372 crore and sold shares worth Rs 22,412 crore. DIIs purchased shares worth Rs 26,528 crore and sold shares worth Rs 14,405 crore.

Market Performance Dalal Street went into a freefall on April 7, as panic-selling took the benchmark indices sharply lower.

The dramatic surge has completely erased the downtrend that had been in place since the latter half of January this year. ""The primary reason behind the selloff is the fear of a full-blown global trade war and its potential to tip the world economy into a recession. Countries including China, Canada, and the European Union have spoken about retaliatory tariffs on American goods, and the uncertainty around whether a settlement can be reached before the next phase of tariff hikes is causing widespread nervousness,"" Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Research and Wealth Management said in a conversation with Moneycontrol. Khemka advised against panic selling or making adventurous bets. Instead, he recommended a disciplined, long-term approach. Investors should use the correction to gradually accumulate fundamentally strong, domestically focused companies, particularly in consumption, financials, and banks. These areas are better positioned to weather global headwinds compared to globally exposed sectors like IT, pharma, and metals.

"Bloodbath on Wall Street: S&P500 enters bear market, Dow Jones down 1,300 pts amid trade war fears",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/bloodbath-on-wall-street-s-p500-enters-bear-market-dow-jones-down-1-300-pts-amid-trade-war-fears-12987804.html,"U.S. stocks plunged for a third straight session on Monday, with investors reeling from the fallout of the Trump administration’s aggressive tariff measures that have triggered a global market rout and fears of a deepening trade war. Coming off a brutal week, Monday’s losses added to the wreckage across equity markets. The Dow has now shed more than 1,200 points to trade 3 percent lower for three straight sessions— a historic first — including a staggering 2,231-point tumble on Friday. The S&P 500 lost 6 percent on the last day of the previous week, its sharpest single-day decline since the COVID crash in March 2020, wiping out 10 percent in just two sessions. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq has officially entered bear market territory, now down over 22 percent from its all-time high. Investors had hoped the weekend would bring some signs of moderation or talks following President Trump’s abrupt imposition of 10 percent tariffs on nearly all key U.S. trade partners, which kicked in on Saturday. Instead, the White House struck a combative tone. ""I don’t want anything to go down, but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something,"" Trump said in a Sunday evening statement. ""We’re losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year to China. Until we fix that, there won’t be a deal."" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick reaffirmed the administration’s firm stance, stating that the tariffs were ""definitely going to stay in place for days and weeks,"" quashing any hopes of a near-term reversal. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent echoed the message, adding that while over 50 countries have approached the U.S. for talks, resolving the issue won’t be quick. Canada and the European Union are reportedly preparing countermeasures as well, signalling a broadening of the standoff. Wall Street now fears the selloff could spiral further, as hedge funds and institutional investors are forced to liquidate positions to meet mounting margin calls. The CBOE Volatility Index — Wall Street’s so-called fear gauge — shot up to 50 early Monday, a level rarely seen outside of major bear markets. The ripple effects were felt far beyond U.S. shores. Bitcoin crashed below $77,000, oil prices tumbled under $60 per barrel to multi-year lows, and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong nosedived 13 percent in its steepest drop since 1997. Germany’s DAX also sank, falling as much as 10 percent during Monday’s session. Among the hardest-hit U.S. stocks were high-profile names like Tesla, down 6 percent in early trade, along with Caterpillar — a global construction bellwether — which shed 5 percent. Apple also saw a sharp 4 percent drop. If the S&P 500 closes down 4 percent or more on Monday, it would mark the third consecutive day of such a steep decline — something that hasn’t happened since the depths of the Great Depression in 1933. With the administration showing no signs of backing down and retaliatory measures mounting, traders are bracing for more pain in the days ahead — unless diplomacy steps in to cool things off. As for Indian markets, Dalal Street went into a freefall on April 7, as panic-selling took the benchmark indices sharply lower.

Britannia (up by 0.65% at closing) BritanniaShares of the FMCG major gained during the market mayhem, with Nifty FMCG index emerging as the least-impacted index, with 3 out of 15 constituents in the positive.

Divis Laboratories shares slip 4% as Entresto patent setback clouds growth outlook,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/divis-laboratories-shares-slip-4-as-entresto-patent-setback-clouds-growth-outlook-13273808.html,"Shares of Divis Laboratories fell as much as 4 percent to Rs 6,545 on Monday, July 14, after a key legal setback over the weekend raised concerns about the company’s future revenue stream from one of its most important products. Indian drugmaker MSN has reportedly won a patent litigation battle involving Entresto, the blockbuster heart failure drug marketed by Novartis. The ruling clears the way for MSN to launch a generic version in the US as early as July 15, 2025 — a development that casts a shadow over Divi’s custom synthesis business, where Entresto's API is a significant revenue contributor. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Entresto is believed to be crucial in Divi’s innovator-led custom synthesis portfolio, accounting for nearly 40 percent of that segment’s revenues. Analysts estimate that it makes up close to a fifth of the company's overall topline, making the ruling a potential earnings disruptor. Brokerage IIFL Securities has flagged that this patent expiry could shave off 12–13 percent from Divi’s EBITDA in the coming year. The firm has maintained a ""reduce"" rating on the stock, assigning it a target price of Rs 5,465 — implying a downside of around 20 percent from current levels.

Sula Vineyards shares drop 2% after firm's Q1 revenue falls 8%; wine tourism surges 22%,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sula-vineyards-shares-drop-2-after-firm-s-q1-revenue-drops-8-wine-tourism-surges-22-13274129.html,"The shares of Sula Vineyards dropped 2 percent in early trade on July 14 after the company's provisional Q1 business update failed to meet expectations. The shares of the company were trading at Rs 293 apiece. Sula Vineyards reported revenue from operations at Rs 118.3 crore for the April-June quarter of ongoing financial year 2026. This marked a fall of 7.9 percent on-year from the Rs 128.4 crore revenue from operations reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year. Notably, the higher revenue in Q1 FY25 was fuelled by a one-time WIPS unwinding benefit of Rs 10.4 crore. Without the one-time gain, the firm's revenue would have marked a marginal rise of 0.2 percent on-year. Revenue from own brands falls 11% The revenue generated from its own brands dipped nearly 11 percent on-year to Rs 102.3 crore in Q1 FY26 from Rs 114.6 crore in Q1 FY25. ""Own Brands revenue remained subdued due to the continued slowdown in urban consumption. Additionally, the increase in excise duties on spirits in Maharashtra, effective 25th June, prompted heavy pre-loading of spirits by the trade aiming to capitalize on pre-revision prices, thereby temporarily blocking the trade placement for wine. Notably, the excise duties on wine remain unchanged, which bodes well for the industry going forward. The share of Elite & Premium improved in Q1 FY26 led by strong double-digit growth in The Source and RĀSĀ,"" the firm said. Wine tourism revenue jumps 22% While the overall revenue from operations dropped, the firm's revenue from wine tourism significantly surge. Sula Vineyards reported a 21.8 percent rise in revenue generated from wine tourism to Rs 13.7 crore in Q1 FY26. It had earlier reported a revenue of Rs 11.3 crore for the segment in Q1 FY25. ""Wine Tourism continued to demonstrate strong momentum, reporting its highest ever Q1 revenue, propelled by an increase in footfalls, record Q1 resort occupancy and spends per guest. In a further boost, Sula just got closer with the operationalization of the Samruddhi Highway in June ’25, reducing travel time from Mumbai to Nashik by nearly an hour. Adding to the good news, The Dindori Tasting Room and Bottle Shop at ND Wines are now open and well-positioned to attract wine enthusiasts, given its proximity to the Gujarat border,"" the company said. Sula Vineyards announces launch of 'Sula Muscat Blanc' Sula Vineyards also announced the launch of 'Sula Muscat Blanc', which is said to be India's first low alcohol still Muscat wine with just 7.5 percent ABV. ""Part of the bestseller Sula Vineyards range, 'Sula Muscat Blanc' will initially be available in wine shops across Maharashtra, with Karnataka to follow in the coming months,"" it said.

Although there were expectations of an interim trade deal between the U.S. and India, the lack of clarity has kept risk appetite in check. Additionally, a weak start to the Q1 earnings season—especially after IT major TCS reported below-par results—added pressure to the markets,"" Ajit Mishra, Senior Vice President at Religare Broking, said. The market opened on a cautious note on Monday, July 14, with losses in IT, FMCG, and pharma stocks weighing on sentiment. Nifty IT was the biggest drag, falling 1.26 percent, while the FMCG and pharma indices slipped 0.07 percent and 0.27 percent, respectively. Media and private banks also edged lower in early trade. Meanwhile, gains in PSU banks, realty, energy, and auto stocks helped cap the downside. Volatility ticked up, with India VIX rising over 3 percent to 12.18, reflecting investor unease. As for individual stocks, DMart shares slipped over 2 percent after the consumer player posted a nearly flat net profit for the June quarter of FY26, as rising competition and margin pressures offset strong revenue growth.

"MFs step up buying spree, fuel block deals and IPO momentum",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/mutual-funds/mfs-step-up-buying-spree-fuel-block-deals-and-ipo-momentum-13273811.html,"Despite elevated volatility in Indian equity markets—driven by ongoing macroeconomic headwinds including geopolitical instability, global trade uncertainties, and muted foreign institutional inflows—domestic mutual funds maintained a strong buying stance, actively participating in high-value block deals and multiple IPOs. This aggressive capital deployment led to a notable reduction in cash reserves across leading fund houses. For the second consecutive month, equity mutual fund schemes trimmed their cash holdings, which reached a seven-month low in June. According to data from Motilal Oswal Financial Services, the top 20 mutual fund houses held 5.8 percent of their assets in cash as of June 30, down from 7.2 percent in April 2025. Mutual Funds invested over Rs 39,000 crore in equities during the month, nearly matching the total block deal value of Rs 41,000 crore, as per ACE Equities. In the primary market, eight IPOs with a combined issue size of Rs 17,690 crore were launched, with mutual funds contributing around Rs 2,700 crore through anchor investments. One of the most prominent transactions was Reliance Industries’ Rs 11,000 crore stake sale in Asian Paints Ltd, where mutual funds acquired shares worth Rs 10,454 crore. SBI Mutual Fund led the charge with an investment of Rs 8,165 crore, followed by ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund at Rs 1,860 crore. Another major block deal involved Vishal Mega Mart, in which Samayat Services divested over 20 percent stake worth Rs 10,500 crore. Mutual funds collectively invested Rs 8,200 crore, with SBI MF contributing Rs 2,530 crore, HDFC MF Rs 2,170 crore, and Kotak Mahindra MF Rs 1,410 crore. Bajaj Finserv also saw heightened fund activity. Promoters Jamnalal Sons and Bajaj Holdings & Investment offloaded a 1.94 percent stake in a Rs 5,828 crore transaction. Mutual funds picked up Rs 4,860 crore worth of shares, led by ICICI Prudential MF at Rs 1,660 crore and SBI MF at Rs 1,520 crore. HDFC, UTI, and Aditya Birla Sun Life MFs also participated, investing between Rs 300 crore and Rs 400 crore each. In the case of Sai Life Sciences, TPG’s Rs 1,500 crore exit through a block deal witnessed mutual fund investments exceeding Rs 1,100 crore. Nippon India MF led with Rs 440 crore, followed by Aditya Birla, Axis, and Invesco MFs with contributions ranging from Rs 200 crore to Rs 300 crore. Premier Energies attracted Rs 1,000 crore from mutual funds out of a Rs 1,600 crore block deal. Other significant investments included Niva Bupa Health, Suzlon Energy, Jyoti CNC Automation, and Yes Bank, with each receiving Rs 370 crore to Rs 390 crore from mutual funds. Mutual fund participation in IPO anchor placements remained robust. Ellenbarrie Industrial Gases secured Rs 428 crore from mutual funds in a Rs 852 crore offering. HDB Financial Services attracted Rs 1,400 crore in MF anchor commitments for its Rs 12,500 crore issue. Kalpataru Projects saw Rs 377 crore allocated by mutual funds in its Rs 1,590 crore IPO, while Oswal Pumps garnered Rs 432 crore out of a Rs 1,388 crore issue. Sambhv Steel Tubes received Rs 55 crore from mutual funds in a Rs 540 crore offering. This intense capital deployment notably impacted cash allocations across fund houses. SBI MF reduced its cash levels from 8.6 percent to 8.1 percent, ICICI Prudential MF from 6.9 percent to 6.1 percent, and HDFC MF from 7.6 percent to 7.2 percent. Nippon India MF saw a modest decline from 2.8 percent to 2.6 percent. Among funds with traditionally higher liquidity cushions, PPFAS MF lowered its cash allocation from 21.6 percent to 19.6 percent. Motilal Oswal MF made a substantial cut from 16.4 percent to 10.1 percent, while Quant MF brought its cash position down from 10.4 percent to 7.2 percent.","According to data from Motilal Oswal Financial Services, the top 20 mutual fund houses held 5.8 percent of their assets in cash as of June 30, down from 7.2 percent in April 2025.","SBI MF reduced its cash levels from 8.6 percent to 8.1 percent, ICICI Prudential MF from 6.9 percent to 6.1 percent, and HDFC MF from 7.6 percent to 7.2 percent.","For the second consecutive month, equity mutual fund schemes trimmed their cash holdings, which reached a seven-month low in June.","Mutual funds collectively invested Rs 8,200 crore, with SBI MF contributing Rs 2,530 crore, HDFC MF Rs 2,170 crore, and Kotak Mahindra MF Rs 1,410 crore."

While the retailer benefited from favourable pricing in staples and non-food categories, increased intensity in the FMCG space, especially from quick commerce rivals, weighed on profitability. DMart's net profit stood at Rs 773 crore, down 0.1 percent from Rs 774 crore in the year-ago period. The muted bottom-line performance came despite a 16.3 percent year-on-year increase in revenue, which rose to Rs 16,359.7 crore from Rs 14,069 crore in Q1FY25. Consolidated operating profit, as measured by EBITDA, rose 6.4 percent to Rs 1,299 crore compared to Rs 1,221.2 crore a year earlier. However, EBITDA margin slipped to 7.94 percent from 8.68 percent in the same period last year. At 9.20 a.m., shares of the retail firm were quoting Rs 4,012.5, lower by 1.3 percent on the NSE. Should you buy, sell, or hold DMart shares? Domestic brokerage Motilal Oswal said, ""With the entry of large offline/online retailers into quick commerce (QC), we expect pricing competition to remain intense over the near term, which could weigh on growth and margins for DMart in the interim.

It maintained its 'buy' call, but cut its target price from Rs 4,800 to Rs 4,500. DMart continues to navigate a challenging competitive landscape, courtesy QC players. Going ahead, HDFC Securities believes that store addition pace and margin improvement will be the key monitorables. The brokerage reiterated its 'add' rating, with a price target of Rs 4,000 per share. ""We estimate margin pressure shall continue given the sustained competition within the FMCG space. Opex increased due to a surge in wages of entry-level positions due to demand-supply mismatch of skilled workforce, service improvements and future investments,"" said Nuvama Institutional Equities. The brokerage trimmed its target price to Rs 4,086, donw from Rs 4,273 earlier, while reaffirming its 'hold' call.

"Sensex, Nifty set for tepid start amid escalating trade tensions; key levels to track on July 14",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sensex-nifty-set-for-tepid-start-amid-escalating-trade-tensions-key-levels-to-track-on-july-14-13273653.html,"Benchmark indices Nifty and Sensex are likely to open flat on July 14, as renewed global trade tensions weigh on investor sentiment. The mood turned cautious after US President Donald Trump imposed 30 percent tariffs on the EU and Mexico, reigniting fears of a trade war. The Gift Nifty was trading at 25,180, down 0.04 percent at about 7:55 am. In the previous session, Dalal Street fell prey to significant selling pressure through the Friday, July 11 session, as investors rushed to book profits amid concerns of a lacklustre earnings season, following IT giant Tata Consultancy Services' weak quarterly show and disappointing commentary. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates On Friday, Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) were net sellers to the tune of Rs 5,104 crore worth of shares in Indian equities, while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) net bought Rs 3,558 crore worth of shares. Here are the key levels to watch out for in today's session On the weekly chart, the index closed with a negative value, indicating a bearish structure and suggesting a likelihood of continued correction. Structurally, market breadth remains weak, with little conviction from bulls. The former support zone at 25,300 has now turned into resistance, and a follow-through breakdown below today’s low of 25,129 could further deteriorate the technical setup. Conversely, only a sustained move above 25,350 would attract buyers, marking this zone as a key resistance for any potential recovery. ""On the technical front, a swing high has been established around 57,370—a level that has repeatedly witnessed selling interest, thereby emerging as a crucial resistance zone. For any meaningful bullish reversal to unfold, a confirmed close above this resistance zone of 56,700 is essential; until then, the upside appears restricted. Currently, the price is consolidating between its 10-day and 20-day exponential moving averages (DEMA), indicating near-term indecision and a lack of directional clarity. A breakdown below the day’s low (56,607.75) could act as a trigger for further weakness on the charts,"" says Dhupesh Dhameja of SAMCO Securities. Despite the sharp decline in the index, India VIX remained relatively subdued, edging up by just 1.24 percent to settle at 11.81, still well below the psychological threshold of 15. This suggests that while selling pressure persists, the sense of panic among market participants seems to be lacking. The low volatility environment also reflects indecision, favouring a gradual downside move rather than erratic swings. The Put-Call Ratio (PCR) has declined further to 0.55 from 0.69, highlighting a rise in call writing and growing bearish sentiment. Meanwhile, Max Pain has slightly shifted to 25,250, suggesting the expiry point where the most options may expire worthless, anchoring the index in its current trading band, Dhameja added.

"Back in the game: Jane Street deposits Rs 4,843.5 crore as directed by Sebi, can trade again",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/back-in-the-game-jane-street-deposits-rs-4-843-5-crore-as-directed-by-sebi-cleared-to-trade-in-indian-markets-13273355.html,"Global proprietary trading powerhouse Jane Street Group can restart trading in Indian equity markets as it has complied with a key directive from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi). The firm has deposited Rs 4,843.5 crore in an escrow account, fulfilling the core requirement laid out in Sebi’s interim order dated July 3, 2025, according to highly placed sources. A source familiar with the matter confirmed, “Jane Street Group deposited Rs 4,843.5 crore on Friday in compliance with the Sebi order.” Another person aware of the proceedings added, “With the deposit made in an escrow account and the order’s terms met, Jane Street can now resume its trading operations on the exchanges.” Later in the morning, SEBI confirmed that Jane Street has complied with its order to deposit Rs 4,843.5 crore in an escrow account. The market regulator also mentioned that the request by Jane Street for removal of certain conditional restrictions is under consideration. SEBI is still investigating the trades of Jane Street Group, which will include trades in other indices and stocks, sources told moneycontrol. SEBIs investigation may take additional 6-7 months to complete. Also, Jane Street Group will have to comply with SEBI directive of not using strategies which are considered manipulative. Deposit made, trading can follow In its interim order, Sebi had directed Jane Street Group entities to deposit the alleged unlawful gains in an escrow account with a scheduled commercial bank in India, with a lien in favour of the regulator (Clause 62.1). Clause 62.2 of the order had prohibited the group from accessing the securities market and barred it from buying, selling, or dealing in securities, either directly or indirectly. The order also directed banks, custodians, depositories, registrars, and transfer agents to prevent any movement of Jane Street’s assets until the deposit was made. However, the order clarified that these restrictions — including the trading ban — would cease once the firm complied and deposited the specified amount (Clause 62.11). That said, Sebi explicitly instructed the group to “cease and desist from directly or indirectly engaging in any fraudulent, manipulative or unfair trade practice or undertaking any activity... that may be in breach of extant regulations, including by dealing in securities using any of the patterns identified or alluded to in this order.” In other words, Jane Street is not allowed to deploy the trading strategy outlined by Sebi in its interim order. Also read: How Jane Street saga unfolded and SEBI passed order? What next While Jane Street has met the regulatory condition, it is unclear whether the firm will immediately return to trading or take a more cautious approach, gauging market sentiment and regulatory signals before reactivating its India strategy. Sebi, in its order, emphasized that Indian exchanges should closely monitor the firm’s future dealings to ensure it does not indulge in any form of market manipulation. Emails sent to both Sebi and Jane Street Group seeking comment remained unanswered at the time of publication. Responses will be included once received. Sebi had also noted that if the entities submit justiciable reasons countering the interim order’s conclusions, a post-hearing decision may revoke the restrictions. Furthermore, if a detailed investigation finds that no manipulation occurred, the impounded gains will be released and the firm will be free to continue trading in India without restrictions.

"Chartist Talks: SBI Sec’s Sudeep Shah bullish on 4 stocks, but signals avoid for telecom stock, sees this bank at overbought zone after 81% rally",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/chartist-talks-sbi-sec-s-sudeep-shah-bullish-on-4-stocks-but-signals-avoid-for-telecom-stock-sees-this-bank-at-overbought-zone-after-81-rally-13271785.html,"Sudeep Shah of SBI Securities is bullish on EID Parry and Prestige Estates Projects. “EID Parry has delivered a decisive breakout from its consolidation phase on the daily chart, while the technical structure suggests that Prestige Estates may be gearing up for a fresh move higher in the short term,” he said in an interview with Moneycontrol. He also maintains a bullish view on both SBFC Finance and Ramco Cements, as both stocks have delivered decisive breakouts backed by robust volumes — a strong technical confirmation of trend strength. However, he recommends avoiding Bharti Airtel for now. After an 81% rally in the past 24 weeks, “the weekly RSI falls into the extreme overbought territory for RBL Bank,” said the Deputy Vice President and Head of Technical and Derivative Research at SBI Securities. Have you noticed Bank Nifty forming a double bottom pattern, a bullish reversal setup, on the daily chart? Does this indicate a possible rebound? Bank Nifty is currently trading near its prior swing low, which raises the possibility of a double bottom formation. However, for this pattern to be validated, more price action and a confirmed breakout above the neckline would be essential. Interestingly, the index is also hovering near an upward sloping trendline support, which lends additional technical strength to this zone. That said, confirmation is still pending, and traders should remain cautious until a clearer reversal signal emerges. Adding to the uncertainty, Bank Nifty moved within a tight range of just 756 points last week — its narrowest weekly range since August 2024 — highlighting indecision and a lack of strong directional bias. On the weekly chart, the formation of a small-bodied bearish candle with a long upper shadow further signals selling pressure at higher levels, often associated with profit-booking or cautious sentiment. Currently, the index is oscillating around its 20-day EMA, marking a crucial inflection zone. Momentum indicators are not offering strong cues either, with the daily RSI stuck in a sideways zone, reflecting a lack of conviction. Going forward, 56,200–56,300 remains an important support zone, while the 57,100–57,200 area will act as a key resistance. A decisive breakout beyond this range — especially a move above the neckline if the double bottom develops — would pave the way for a stronger directional move, potentially confirming a bullish reversal. Do you see a strong possibility of a bounce-back in the Nifty 50 after initial weakness next week? The benchmark Nifty index spent the first four trading sessions of the week trapped in a tight 200-point range, reflecting the indecision among market participants. But on Friday, the calm broke. The index opened with a sharp gap down, slipped below its consolidation zone, and faced renewed selling pressure, signaling that sentiment is beginning to tilt in favor of the bears. What’s more alarming is that Nifty has now slipped below its crucial 20-day EMA, which has also begun to slope downward — a classic sign of emerging weakness. The momentum indicators aren’t painting a comforting picture either. The daily RSI has given a bearish crossover and continues to head south, while the MACD histogram has flipped into negative territory. Collectively, these signals suggest that downside momentum may be gaining strength. From a technical standpoint, immediate support now lies in the 24,900–24,850 zone, where the 50-day EMA is placed. A break below 24,850 could push the index toward the next key support at 24,550. On the flip side, a move above the 25,300–25,350 zone is required for bulls to regain control in the short term. Amid this technical caution, macro and earnings uncertainties are only adding to investor anxiety. With tariff uncertainty rising globally and Q1 earnings just getting started—kicked off by TCS on Thursday—markets are entering a critical phase. Investors are now watching for signs of margin pressures, global demand outlooks, and forward guidance from corporates. In this tug-of-war between technical breakdowns and earnings expectations, a cautious and stock-specific approach may be the best strategy for now. What are your top two buying ideas for the coming week, and what are the justifications behind those picks? EID Parry The stock has delivered a decisive breakout from its consolidation phase on the daily chart, signaling a fresh leg of the uptrend. What makes this breakout significant is the accompanying surge in volume, lending strong conviction to the move. Notably, the stock has been consistently outperforming the frontline indices over the past few trading sessions, highlighting growing investor interest and relative strength. As the stock is trading at an all-time high, all the moving averages and momentum-based setups are showing strong bullish momentum. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 1,155-1,145 level with a stop-loss of Rs 1,100 level. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 1,260 in the short term. Prestige Estates Projects The stock registered a swing high of Rs 1,761 on June 24, followed by a throwback phase that was accompanied by subdued volumes — a sign of healthy profit booking rather than trend reversal. Notably, the correction found support near the 34-day EMA. Post this pullback, the stock has resumed its upward journey, supported by a noticeable rise in volume, adding conviction to the ongoing rebound. Over the past few sessions, it has been outperforming the frontline indices, signaling renewed strength and relative leadership. Momentum indicators are now turning increasingly positive. The daily RSI is comfortably placed in bullish territory, while other oscillators are also supporting the ongoing uptrend. The technical structure suggests that the stock may be gearing up for a fresh move higher in the short term. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 1,700-1,690 level with a stop-loss of Rs 1,630 level. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 1,820 in the short term. Is this a good level to consider buying Bharti Airtel, which has reached the swing high of May? The stock marked a high of Rs 2,045 on July 02 and thereafter started witnessing profit booking. Since the last two trading sessions, the stock has witnessed a correction along with a relatively higher volume. Also, it has slipped below the 20-day EMA level, which is a bearish sign. Hence, we recommend avoiding Bharti Airtel for now. Do you think RBL Bank is on the verge of a rounding bottom breakout on the weekly chart, or is it currently looking oversold? Yes, on the weekly chart, RBL Bank appears to be on the verge of a Rounding Bottom breakout — a bullish continuation pattern that typically indicates a shift from accumulation to a sustained uptrend. The price structure suggests growing strength, and a breakout above the neckline could confirm a long-term trend reversal. However, it's important to note that over the past 24 weeks, the stock has already rallied over 81%, indicating a sharp and extended move. As a result, the weekly RSI is currently hovering around the 80 mark, which falls into the extreme overbought territory as per RSI range shift principles. While the broader structure remains positive, the elevated RSI suggests that a near-term pause or consolidation cannot be ruled out before the stock attempts a confirmed breakout. Traders should watch for volume confirmation and price stability near the breakout zone for higher conviction. Is Dabur a compelling buy at current levels, considering the chart pattern and momentum indicators? Dabur has been showing strong relative strength, consistently outperforming the frontline indices over the past few sessions. The recent price action is backed by robust volumes and strong bullish momentum, suggesting growing investor interest and positive sentiment around the stock. However, from a momentum standpoint, there’s a need for caution. The daily RSI is currently hovering around the 80 mark, which signals an overbought condition as per RSI range shift principles. This suggests that while the broader trend remains positive, the stock may be due for a short-term pause or consolidation before it resumes its next leg of the uptrend. In summary, while Dabur continues to show promise, fresh entries may be better timed after a mild pullback or consolidation, offering a more favourable risk-reward setup. What is your view on SBFC Finance and Ramco Cements, both of which had a strong rally in the past week? We maintain a bullish view on both SBFC Finance and Ramco Cements, as both stocks have delivered decisive breakouts backed by robust volumes — a strong technical confirmation of trend strength. In both cases, the price action is well-supported by rising moving averages, and momentum-based indicators are firmly in bullish territory, signaling that the underlying trend remains healthy and intact. The recent rally suggests renewed buying interest and strong participation from market participants. As long as the breakout levels are protected, both stocks are well-positioned to extend their upward momentum in the near term.

Broader indices snap 2-week gaining streak; these smallcaps gain 10-39%,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/broader-indices-snap-2-week-gaining-streak-these-smallcaps-gain-10-39-13270551.html,"The broader indices remained under pressure and lost between 0.6-1 percent amid volatility led by weak start of the India Inc earnings, uncertainty around trade negotiations with US, and President Donald Trump's plans to impose blanket tariffs of 15% or 20% on most trade partners. Among broader indices, the BSE Small-Cap index shed 0.6 percent, while BSE Mid-Cap and Large-Cap indices fell 1 percent each. The mid and small-cap indices snapped 2-week gaining momentum, while large-cap index extended the fall in the second week. For the week, the BSE Sensex index declined 932.42 points or 1.11 percent to end at 82,500.47, and Nifty50 shed 311.15 points or 1.22 percent to finish at 25,149.85.

Delays in finalizing the India–US trade pact, coupled with the US decision to extend tariff deadlines, have added to short-term uncertainties. Additionally, the US move to impose a 35% tariff on Canada further dampened market sentiment,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments. ""Consumption-oriented sectors such as FMCG and discretionary stocks experienced selective buying, supported by signs of urban demand revival and improving margins. A backdrop of easing inflation, declining interest rates, and a favourable monsoon contributed to the overall positive undertone."" ""Broader indices slipped into negative territory due to a lack of triggers to sustain current premium valuations and uninspiring results from a key IT bellwether, which raised concerns over FY26 earnings estimates. As Q1FY26 earnings unfold, investors are closely monitoring guidance on margins and sector dynamics. Upcoming economic data releases including inflation figures from the U.S. and India, as well as China’s GDP numbers are expected to draw investor attention,"" he added.

On the other hand, Peninsula Land, Jaiprakash Power Ventures, John Cockerill India, Dish TV India, Shiva Cement, Force Motors, ACME Solar Holdings gained between 15-39 percent. Where is Nifty50 headed? Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities Nifty on the weekly chart slipped below the crucial support of around 25200 levels as per change in polarity. Further weakness from here could indicate a failure of the decisive upside breakout of the larger range movement as per weekly timeframe chart. The underlying trend of Nifty has turned down. Further weakness from here could drag Nifty down to 24800-24700 levels by next week. Any pullback rally could find resistance around 25300 levels. Amol Athawale, VP- Technical Research, Kotak Securities: On weekly charts, Nifty has formed a bearish candle, and on daily charts, it has formed a lower top formation. Additionally, after a long time, Nifty slipped below the 20-day SMA (Simple Moving Average) zone, which supports further weakness from the current levels. We believe that as long as the market remains below 25,300/83000, the weak sentiment is likely to continue. Below this level, the market could slip to the 50-day SMA or around 25,000/82100. Further downside may also continue, potentially dragging the market down to 24,800-24650/81500-81100. On the other hand, if the market trades above 25,300/83000, sentiment could improve. If the market manages to stay above this level, it could move up to 25,550–25,650/83700-84000. Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Research, Wealth Management, Motilal Oswal Financial Services As the earnings season progresses, markets are expected to witness volatility driven by stock-specific factors. Adding to the cautious tone, President Donald Trump stated that he plans to impose blanket tariffs of 15% or 20% on most trade partners. The lingering uncertainty around trade negotiations is likely to keep markets in a consolidation mode. Investors will now focus on key domestic macro data, including CPI and WPI inflation prints, while tracking ongoing Q1 earnings and updates on the India–US trade deal. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The Nifty continues to remain weak as the index slipped below the previous swing low on the hourly chart. Additionally, it has fallen below the 21 EMA on the daily timeframe. Momentum also remains weak in the short term, with the RSI in a negative crossover. However, after the recent decline, the index has approached the support of the 200-hourly moving average. A move above 25,150-25,160 in the initial trading hour could trigger a rally towards 25,250 and 25,400. On the downside, support is placed at 25,090 and 24,900.

"Chartist Talks: I-Sec’s Dharmesh Shah sees strong Nifty structure despite recent correction; expects index to reach 25,800 in August",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/chartist-talks-i-sec-s-dharmesh-shah-sees-strong-nifty-structure-despite-recent-correction-expects-index-to-reach-25-800-in-august-13270158.html,"According to Dharmesh Shah of ICICI Securities, the slower pace of retracement while trading in the vicinity of the 20-day EMA highlights robust price structure in the Nifty 50. Hence, any dip from hereon should be capitalised to accumulate quality stocks with strong earnings, he advised, as he expects Nifty to gradually rise and head towards 25,800 in the coming month. After a strong recovery in HUL, he said the stock has logged a resolute breakout from a bullish flag pattern, indicating the continuation of the uptrend. ""This makes us believe that HUL would extend the ongoing up move in the next weeks as well,"" said the Head Technical at ICICI Securities. Do you expect the Nifty 50 to break below the 24,800 support level next week, considering Friday's gap-down opening? Equity benchmarks extended a breather over the second consecutive week amid a lack of clarity on the India-US bilateral trade deal. We expect volatility to remain elevated amid the progression of earnings season, coupled with tariff-related developments, wherein strong support is placed at 24,900-24,800 levels. Currently, the index is undergoing healthy consolidation wherein over past 10 sessions, Nifty has merely retraced 50% of preceding 10 sessions up move. Slower pace of retracement while trading in the vicinity of 20-day EMA, highlights robust price structure. Hence, any dip from hereon should be capitalised to accumulate quality stocks with strong earnings as we expect Nifty to gradually resolve higher and head towards 25,800 in coming month. Do you think the rally in Hindustan Unilever (HUL) seen on Friday will continue into next week? The share price of HUL staged a strong recovery after finding support from five five-year rising trendline, indicating structural uptrend is intact. On the weekly chart, the stock has logged a resolute breakout from a bullish flag pattern, indicating continuation of the uptrend that makes us believe that HUL would extend the ongoing up move in the next weeks as well. What is your view on Piramal Enterprises, which witnessed a trendline breakout? As correctly highlighted, the share price of Piramal Enterprises is at the cusp of breaking out of 3 3-year falling trendline backed by a pick-up in volumes, suggesting larger participation in the direction of the trend. Further, price movement since March 2023 lows has been captured in a well-defined upward sloping channel, suggesting elevated buying demand that augurs well for the next leg of the up move towards Rs 1,500 in the coming quarter. What are your top two stock picks for the coming week? Power Finance Corporation The stock corrected 38% in the past 11 months post which it has undergone base formation in the vicinity of 100-week EMA, indicating buying interest at lower levels. Despite recent volatility, the stock managed to hold on to the key support zone of Rs 360-370, indicating buying demand at key support zone. Key point to highlight is that the stock broke out from a seven-month falling trendline after witnessing supportive efforts in the vicinity of 61.80% retracement of the move from (Rs 225- 580), indicating conclusion of the corrective bias, which augurs well for the next leg of the up-move. Going ahead, we expect the stock to gradually resolve higher and head towards Rs 478, being a 50% retracement of the previous fall (Rs 580-357) wherein strong support is placed at Rs 388. Tata Power Company The Power index snapped two quarters decline and staged a strong recovery. Over the past two months, the stock has been forming a higher base in the vicinity of the 200-day EMA, which has been taking the shape of a rising channel. We expect stock to eventually resolve higher and head towards our target of Rs 445, as it is the upper band of the rising channel that coincided with the December 2024 high of Rs 447. In the process, strong support is placed at Rs 374 as it is a 50% retracement of the February-June rally (Rs 326-416) Do you expect Bank Nifty to decisively break below its 56,600 support level next week? The index has taken a pause post four months of a strong rally, indicating a breather before the next leg up move. The index is currently approaching key support of a rising trendline placed at 56,400. Only a decisive close below that will lead to an extended correction, else the index will consolidate in the broader range of 56,400-57,600. Further, one should note that in the upcoming week, major heavyweights’ banks will declare their Q1 earnings, which will dictate the next set of tone for the index. Do you anticipate a major down move in the Nifty IT index following its consolidation breakdown this week? The Nifty IT index staged a strong recovery from April low. Currently index faced stiff resistance from its 200-day EMA and closed below past 3-week lows. Consequently, current decline is bigger than the previous intermediate corrections seen during past three months up move which indicates pause in upward momentum which would lead to prolonged consolidation.

The session began on a negative note following disappointing results from IT major TCS, which further worsened due to profit-taking in heavyweight stocks across other sectors. On the sectoral front, all key indices ended in the red, except the defensives—FMCG and pharma. IT, auto, and realty were among the top losers. The broader indices also came under pressure, each declining by nearly a percent. Sentiment remained subdued due to ongoing uncertainty around tariff-related issues and a weak start to the earnings season. As a result, the Nifty slipped below its first line of defense—the 20-day exponential moving average (20-DEMA)—disrupting the ongoing positive trend. We may now see a phase of consolidation in the index, with upcoming earnings keeping volatility high across sectors. In this environment, traders should exercise greater caution, focus on risk management, and be selective while identifying trading opportunities.

Gainers & Losers: Top 10 stocks that moved the most on July 11,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/gainers-losers-top-10-stocks-that-moved-the-most-on-july-11-13268212.html,"After opening mildly in the red, Dalal Street fell prey to significant selling pressure through the Friday, July 11 session, as investors rushed to book profits amid concerns of a lacklustre earnings season, following IT giant Tata Consultancy Services' weak quarterly show and disappointing commentary. Glenmark Pharmaceuticals | CMP Rs 2,181 | Shares surged an intraday high of 17 percent after the company announced that its subsidiary has signed an exclusive global licensing agreement for its investigational asset ISB 2001 with New York-based AbbVie. ISB 2001 is currently in the first phase of clinical trials for patients suffering from relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, a type of cancer, the company said in an exchange filing. Hindustan Unilever | CMP Rs 2,519 | Stock jumped up to 5 percent on July 11 after the company announced Priya Nair as its new MD & CEO, succeeding Rohit Jawa, who steps down after a two-year stint. Nair, currently President of Beauty & Wellbeing, will be the first woman to lead HUL in its 92-year history. She oversees a €13.2 billion global portfolio, including brands like Dove, Sunsilk, Clear, and Vaseline. TCS | CMP Rs 3,266 | Shares tanked 3.5 following its Q1 earnings which deepened concerns around the broader Q1 earnings season, with experts flagging limited clarity on growth prospects for FY26 for the IT major. Brokerages noted that the company’s constant currency growth missed street expectations, and cautioned that a meaningful margin improvement over the rest of the year appears unlikely. IREDA | CMP Rs 160 |Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA) slipped 6 percent after its asset quality took a sharp hit in the June quarter, overshadowing strong loan growth and denting investor sentiment. The state-run lender reported a 35.7 percent year-on-year drop in net profit to Rs 247 crore, largely due to a rise in bad loans. Tata Elxsi | CMP Rs 6,066 | The stock tanked as much as 4 percent after the company reported a sharp drop in June quarter earnings, triggering concerns over demand headwinds and margin pressure. The disappointing performance also prompted global brokerages to cut estimates and maintain bearish views on the stock. Zee Entertainment |CMP Rs 137 | The stock price plunged over 3 percent on July 11 after promoters received a second setback from shareholders, as investors voted against the proposed capital infusion of Rs 2,237 crore through preferential warrants. Dreamfolks Services | CMP Rs 160 |Shares hit a new low of Rs 158, falling over 3 percent on July 11 following the closure of the programmes run for its clients, including Axis Bank, and ICICI Bank, effective from July 1, 2025. In terms of technicals, the relative strength index (RSI) of Dreamfolks Services stands at 19.7, signaling it's trading in the oversold territory. Mankind Pharma | CMP Rs 2,578 | Shares of Mankind Pharma gained as much as 6 percent on July 11, before paring almost all gains, after brokerage firm Jefferies increased its price target on the healthcare firm, projecting a potential upside to 18 percent from its previous closing price. RPP Infra | CMP Rs 141 | RPP Infra shares rose as much as 5 percent on July 11 after the company announced that it had secured orders worth Rs 365.85 crore in Rajasthan. The company said the order was awarded to RPP-BCC IV, a joint venture in which RPP Infra holds a 51 percent stake. Bharti Airtel | CMP Rs 1,922 | Shares slipped over 2 percent after UBS downgraded the stock amid expensive valuations. The brokerage is expecting a 10 percent ARPU hike over FY25-28, with later years largely being driven by secular factors. Even the FY26 tariff hike faces the risk of being delayed or coming in with a lower magnitude than anticipated.","Tata Elxsi | CMP Rs 6,066 | The stock tanked as much as 4 percent after the company reported a sharp drop in June quarter earnings, triggering concerns over demand headwinds and margin pressure.","Tata Elxsi | CMP Rs 6,066 | The stock tanked as much as 4 percent after the company reported a sharp drop in June quarter earnings, triggering concerns over demand headwinds and margin pressure.","Mankind Pharma | CMP Rs 2,578 | Shares of Mankind Pharma gained as much as 6 percent on July 11, before paring almost all gains, after brokerage firm Jefferies increased its price target on the healthcare firm, projecting a potential upside to 18 percent from its previous closing price.","Dreamfolks Services | CMP Rs 160 |Shares hit a new low of Rs 158, falling over 3 percent on July 11 following the closure of the programmes run for its clients, including Axis Bank, and ICICI Bank, effective from July 1, 2025."

"From spying on wife to fishing for company intel, Sebi battles bizarre RTI requests",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/from-spying-on-wives-to-fishing-for-company-intel-sebi-battles-bizarre-rti-requests-13267793.html,"The Right to Information route, or RTIs - meant to be a tool for transparency – has attracted strange, personal, and downright bizarre queries, as has been evident in some of the recent filings with the market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi). Sampling the queries revealed one curious case where a husband used the RTI route to seek details of his wife's financial portfolio, while another RTI asked for guidance on lodging a corruption case against a certain Sebi official. There are also regular queries from those whom Sebi calls ‘habitual RTI filers’. Moneycontrol managed to look inside the world of weird RTIs landing at Sebi’s doorstep, including this one application received by Sebi on April 26, 2025 where the applicant sought the following details:“A. Is my wife XXXXXXXXXX holding a DEMAT Account? B. If so, how many DEMAT accounts and their details? C. Is my wife XXXXXXXXXX holding a trading account? D. If so, how many trading accounts and their details? E. Has my wife XXXXXXXXXX invested in any mutual funds? F. If so, could you furnish the details of the mutual funds? G. I request to share other information of my wife, XXXXXXXXXX, that pertains to shares, dividends, capital gains, FDRs, mutual funds, stocks, debentures, etc.” Sebi's CPIO informed that the information sought is not maintained by Sebi in the normal course, and hence, is not available with the regulator. Subsequently, the applicant went into appeal, but was later rejected. Another case of an RTI filed with Sebi on May 26, 2025 revealed a query seeking information about where to file a complaint against a Sebi official. “Ms. XXXXXXXXX has been caught red-handed defending (proof attached) the Depository Participant—Bank of Maharashtra—and protecting them from disciplinary actions arising out of multiple regulatory violations spread over a period of one year. Should a misconduct complaint be filed against Ms. XXXX directly with the SEBI Chief, or the CVO, or the Anti-Corruption Bureau, or the Ministry of Finance?” Another application was filed by the same person on how to file a case against a Sebi official, asking, “How to file a formal corruption case against Ms. XXXXX XXXX, who is a XXX in SEBI?” In this case, the CPIO conveyed that the information for lodging complaints against employees of Sebi is available on the watchdog’s website. Yet, an appeal was filed on the ground that access to the information requested was refused, which was rejected on the grounds that the information sought is available in public domain. One RTI applicant - a frequent filer –constantly seeks details of NOCs issued by Sebi to multiple companies for IPOs such as Belrise Industries, Ather Energy, TCNS Clothing, HDFC AMC, RNEL, Tech Mahindra etc. Sebi’s CPIO has consistently replied that such information is not available with the regulator, yet the RTI filings have continued. Sebi noted that not only for the companies mentioned, but the applicant also sought ‘copies of Sebi’s permission or NOC’ for various other listed companies too, through numerous RTI applications. The appellate authority under RTI at Sebi observed that “such repetitive filing of RTI applications amounts to misuse/abuse of the RTI Act”. In the past, there have been instances where one complainant had filed as many as 578 RTIs. As per Sebi’s annual report, in the last two years, 150-300 RTIs were received every month, raising around 6,500-17,000 queries. Similarly, 300-800 appeals too were received. On many occasions, people send complaints as RTIs, for which Sebi has a dedicated SCORES portal. Shailesh Gandhi, Former Chief Information Commissioner told Moneycontrol that public authorities should freely share information as per the mandate of the RTI Act. “Citizens are the owners of the assets of the country, and owners should not be denied information about their assets”, Gandhi added. On concerns of misuse, he said, “There are clear-cut carve-outs like intellectual property, privacy, etc.” Many times, RTIs are more about giving information than seeking information, and hence they get rejected. That’s not all, sometimes the reason for rejection could be the framing of queries, as many people pose them in an interrogatory manner instead of seeking information, people familiar with the issue told Moneycontrol. Also Read: Merchant bankers are gearing up for a ‘beauty parade’ in anticipation of NSE’s IPO RTI experts suggest for a better strike rate in getting information, it is important to know which public authority may have the information. Also, asking for personal information will not get results. The application should be in the tone of seeking information and not informing or raising a question. Information already available in public domain asked under RTI is unlikely to get any response. For better and quicker response online RTI mode through https://rtionline.gov.in is advised.","Moneycontrol managed to look inside the world of weird RTIs landing at Sebi’s doorstep, including this one application received by Sebi on April 26, 2025 where the applicant sought the following details:“A.","Should a misconduct complaint be filed against Ms. XXXX directly with the SEBI Chief, or the CVO, or the Anti-Corruption Bureau, or the Ministry of Finance?” Another application was filed by the same person on how to file a case against a Sebi official, asking, “How to file a formal corruption case against Ms. XXXXX XXXX, who is a XXX in SEBI?” In this case, the CPIO conveyed that the information for lodging complaints against employees of Sebi is available on the watchdog’s website.","One RTI applicant - a frequent filer –constantly seeks details of NOCs issued by Sebi to multiple companies for IPOs such as Belrise Industries, Ather Energy, TCNS Clothing, HDFC AMC, RNEL, Tech Mahindra etc.","Should a misconduct complaint be filed against Ms. XXXX directly with the SEBI Chief, or the CVO, or the Anti-Corruption Bureau, or the Ministry of Finance?” Another application was filed by the same person on how to file a case against a Sebi official, asking, “How to file a formal corruption case against Ms. XXXXX XXXX, who is a XXX in SEBI?” In this case, the CPIO conveyed that the information for lodging complaints against employees of Sebi is available on the watchdog’s website."

Broader markets also slipped nearly a percent, mirroring the weak undertone. Gains in pharma and FMCG offered some cushion but weren’t enough to offset the overall decline. At about 12:20 pm, the Sensex was down 674.80 points or 0.81 percent at 82,515.48, and the Nifty was down 190.20 points or 0.75 percent at 25,165.05.

India has also lagged global peers like South Korea, Germany, Japan, and the MSCI EM index, largely due to stretched valuations. TCS’s Q1 results highlight ongoing challenges for large-cap IT, though midcap IT may fare better. The quarter’s likely outperformers include telecom, oil and gas, and select auto segments. In this environment, investors would do well to focus on reasonably valued stocks with strong earnings visibility,"" says V K Vijayakumar, Chief Strategist at Geojit Investments Limited. Sectoral indices on the NSE were largely in the red during intraday trade on July 11, with broad-based weakness across key sectors. Nifty IT was the top laggard, down 1.85 percent, followed by Auto, and Oil & Gas, which were lower by over 1 percent each. Smallcap, and Midcap indices also saw cuts nearing 1 percent. Banking stocks remained under pressure, with Nifty Bank down 0.54 percent, PSU Bank falling 0.60 percent, and Private Bank slipping 0.29 percent. Losses were also seen in Consumer Durables, Energy, and Realty. In contrast, FMCG and Pharma provided some support, rising 0.85 percent and 0.50 percent, respectively. India VIX edged up 2.14 percent to 11.92, indicating a mild rise in market volatility. Also read: Who are in charge of Jane Street India?

The management sounded optimistic to drive growth within Transportation from Q2, while M&C would recover from Q3 led by large deal ramp up. The timely ramp ups of the automotive deals and continued engagement with OEMs on the new-age offerings, give confidence to the management to drive growth within Transportation. However, the structural demand for M&C and H&L remains weak due to business consolidation and tariff impact on medical devices, leading to pullback on R&D and discretionary spending.

"Tesla's India showroom gets set for launch, M&M drags Nifty Auto index as competition hots up",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/tesla-s-india-showroom-gets-set-for-launch-m-m-drags-nifty-auto-index-as-competition-hots-up-13266161.html,"SUV maker M&M's shares are down nearly 2 percent in early trade on July 11, weighing on Nifty Auto index which is lower by 0.7 percent, as electric vehicle maker Tesla said it will be opening its first India showroom in Mumbai on July 15. The showroom will be called an 'experience center', said Tesla officials, bringing it closer to start selling its cars in India, which will be imported into the country. Shares of Bosch, a component supplier to Tesla, are higher by over 3 percent in the day's trade. Some of the other Indian suppliers to Tesla include names like Samvardhana Motherson International, Suprajit Engineering, Sona BLW Precision and Varroc Engineering. Amid a rising threat of additional tariffs by US President Trump, Moneycontrol on July 10 reported that Tesla has assured its Indian suppliers of continued procurement, irrespective of any levies. M&M Shares Sell Off Though under selling pressure in the share market on July 11, M&M emerged as the largest electric car and SUV player in Indian SUV segment in terms of revenue share during the March quarter, as per JATO data cited by the company. However, Tesla's entry is expected to intensify the competitive intensity in India's electric automotive space. In calendar year 2026, M&M has already announced plans to launch three ICE products, two born electric products, and two LCVs. On August 15, 2025, M&M has planned to reveal a new platform vision base, on which new products will start coming out from 2027. The SUV maker has opened up all markets - Tier I, II, even III, according to Rajesh Jejurikar, Automotive CEO at M&M, and is gradually increasing delivery of its EV offerings in all geographies. The booking momentum continues to be 'very steady and very strong', he said. ""...this is a business which we don't want to be rash and ramping up for two reasons. One is, there is a lot of product complexity. We are learning new technologies as we ramp up and so are our suppliers. So, we have to be very cautious in the way we ramp up production,"" Rajesh Jejurikar had said in May 2025. HDFC Securities in a note on July 11 said it sees softer demand for Indian auto market, both domestically and globally, which will impact volume growth. TVS Motors could benefit from its successful models and variants, including the EVs, while Mahindra & Mahindra has been seeing increasing traction for UVs and tractors. Tesla's India Plans To begin with, Tesla has imported fully-built cars, and is likely to start selling its Model Y in India, sourced from its Shanghai factory, China, Bloomberg News reported on June 20. Some news reports had said that five Model Y cars have are already in Mumbai at a 70% import duty. The Model Y is the world’s largest selling electric car. Tesla has also imported Supercharger components, accessories, merchandise and spares from US, China and the Netherlands, the report said. For Tesla, India's high import duties on cars have been a major hurdle in its expansion plans, given the high tariff and then the tax levied on the sale of the car, making its vehicles more expensive to begin with. ""..it would be a great market to enter because India has a big middle class, which we would want to tap in, and that is the market which we want to be in. But, again, these kind of things create a little bit of tension which we’re trying to work around,"" CFO Vaibhav Teneja had said during the Q12025 earnings call. Tesla has not yet named a replacement for its country head for India, after he resigned ahead of the planned entry into the world’s third-largest car market. The EV maker is reportedly also finalizing another showroom in Delhi's Aerocity, and has plans for an office in Bengaluru. Earlier this year, during PM Modi's US visit, Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk met the Prime Minister to discuss strengthening collaboration between Indian and US entities. Tesla's India foray comes after years of discussions over Musk's concerns around tariffs and New Delhi's demand for local manufacturing. EVs make up over 5% of India's passenger vehicle sales and premium cars are still less than 2% of the total car market, as per official data.","So, we have to be very cautious in the way we ramp up production,"" Rajesh Jejurikar had said in May 2025.","SUV maker M&M's shares are down nearly 2 percent in early trade on July 11, weighing on Nifty Auto index which is lower by 0.7 percent, as electric vehicle maker Tesla said it will be opening its first India showroom in Mumbai on July 15.","HDFC Securities in a note on July 11 said it sees softer demand for Indian auto market, both domestically and globally, which will impact volume growth.","M&M Shares Sell Off Though under selling pressure in the share market on July 11, M&M emerged as the largest electric car and SUV player in Indian SUV segment in terms of revenue share during the March quarter, as per JATO data cited by the company."

The degree of weakness further intensified due to slowdown in international business down 0.5% QoQ CC, attributed to a softness in BFSI (down 0.5% QoQ CC). Despite concluding Q1 on a weaker trajectory, the management was confident of achieving better revenue growth in FY26 vs FY25, for international business. The tariff induced verticals already remained soft, the weakness in Europe BFSI further stalling the international business outlook, evident through weak Q1 deal TCV in BFS. We expect FY26 international growth largely to be flat CC, which translates to an ask-rate of ~0.6% CQGR, while we expect the BSNL add-on will support the growth in Q2/Q3 before it sees further ramp-down in Q4. On the margins, utilization and rationalizing employee pyramid are the major levers, however the low-margin add-on BSNL deal would continue to weigh on FY26 margins. We are adjusting our revenue estimates for the quarterly miss while keeping our margins broadly unchanged.

Mutual funds trump retail in Glenmark surge as cancer drug deal sends stock soaring,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/mutual-funds-trump-retail-in-glenmark-surge-as-cancer-drug-deal-sends-stock-soaring-13266106.html,"Mutual funds just beat retail shareholders hands down in Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, and the score wasn’t even close. After Glenmark’s landmark $2 billion licensing deal with US major AbbVie for its cancer drug, ISB 2001, the stock hit the 10% upper circuit on July 11. But the biggest winners weren’t retail investors — they were India’s top mutual funds that had steadily loaded up on the stock over the past two years. Data shows mutual fund ownership in Glenmark Pharma jumped from 9.1% in June 2023 to 14.6% in March 2025 — a clear signal of growing institutional conviction in the company’s innovation pipeline, even when public shareholders failed to fully price in its R&D potential. Promoters continue to hold a 46% stake, while FIIs remained steady at around 23%. Public shareholding, meanwhile, has declined from 20.4% to 15.56% during the same period, indicating that retail investors had been steadily exiting. The stock also had its share of marquee investors. Prashant Jain’s 3P India Equity Fund held just over 1% in Glenmark, while Ashish Dhawan held 1.77% in March 2025 in his personal capacity, although he pared his holding from 2.55% in September 2024. Among the fund houses that struck gold:-HDFC Mutual Fund was the most aggressive.

Smallcap World Fund trimmed its stake from 4.84% in December 2023 to 3.21% in March 2025, while Norway’s Government Pension Fund Global maintained a 3.25% holding. Fund managers have clearly showed more faith in Glenmark’s R&D narrative than retail investors. The big institutional money rode on the belief that Glenmark’s innovation pipeline was undervalued — and this AbbVie licensing deal, with a $700 million upfront payout and $1.2 billion in milestones, proved them right.","Data shows mutual fund ownership in Glenmark Pharma jumped from 9.1% in June 2023 to 14.6% in March 2025 — a clear signal of growing institutional conviction in the company’s innovation pipeline, even when public shareholders failed to fully price in its R&D potential.","Its Midcap Opportunities Fund held over 1.06 crore shares, while HDFC Manufacturing Fund and HDFC Balanced Advantage Fund also had sizable exposure, with 12 lakh and 8.85 lakh shares respectively.-UTI Value Fund (9 lakh shares), Bandhan Small-cap Fund (8.62 lakh), and Aditya Birla Sun Life Midcap Fund (7.01 lakh).-Mahindra Manulife Mutual Fund emerged as one of the top buyers in June.","Public shareholding, meanwhile, has declined from 20.4% to 15.56% during the same period, indicating that retail investors had been steadily exiting.","Its Midcap Opportunities Fund held over 1.06 crore shares, while HDFC Manufacturing Fund and HDFC Balanced Advantage Fund also had sizable exposure, with 12 lakh and 8.85 lakh shares respectively.-UTI Value Fund (9 lakh shares), Bandhan Small-cap Fund (8.62 lakh), and Aditya Birla Sun Life Midcap Fund (7.01 lakh).-Mahindra Manulife Mutual Fund emerged as one of the top buyers in June."
"Hindustan Zinc jumps 1.5%: Silver at lifetime high, other key reasons behind stock surge",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/hindustan-zinc-jumps-1-5-silver-at-lifetime-high-other-key-reasons-behind-stock-surge-13265884.html,"The shares of Hindustan Zinc jumped over 1.5 percent on July 11 as prices of silver continued to rally. The Vedanta Group-owned company's shares were trading at Rs 430 apiece in the early trading hours. Silver's future contracts with September expiry opened at Rs 1.09 lakh per kg on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX). The prices then soared further to hit a lifetime high of over Rs Rs 1.11 lakh per kg. In the domestic markets, the price of one kilogram of silver gained Rs 1,000 in a single day to hover near Rs 1.11 lakh, according to data on Good Returns. Hindustan Zinc is the largest producer of silver in India, and produces refined silver with a minimum 99.9 percent purity. The sharp rise in the bullion's prices is expected to further boost the stock. Axis Securities remains bullish on silver prices, stating that the selloff in industrial metals was driving prices. Vedanta management denies 'Ponzi scheme' claims: The rise in the share price also comes after Vedanta Group denied 'Ponzi scheme' allegations levelled against it by American short-seller Viceroy Research. Vedanta Chairman Anil Agarwal told shareholders during its Annual General Meeting (AGM) on July 10 that the company has remained ""extremely transparent"". ""[The report] appears to be a motivated report, but we will address it,"" he added. He further outlined the company's growth prospects in the near future. ""Our 3D strategy, Demerger, Diversification and Deleveraging will enable us to double in size and unlock maximum value for our stakeholders… This is not just a story of growth, it is the story of realizing India’s aspirations. We are fully aligned with the needs of a developed Bharat,"" he said. Vedanta said that it has secured 10 critical mineral blocks across India, one of the largest by any private sector company. It is also setting up the world's first industrial Zinc Park and India's largest Aluminium Park, which is aimed at helping MSMEs and creating lakhs of employment opportunities. The positive outlook from the company's management may have also boosted the stock. Don't get distracted, says JPMorgan JPMorgan meanwhile said investors shouldn’t get distracted by the allegations, and it remains overweight on Vedanta. For Hindustan Zinc, the international brokerage said that the Indian government continues to maintain an active presence on its board, Mint reported. It added that government oversight continues to be effective, especially concerning capex planning. US-based short seller Viceroy Research on July 9 said that it has taken a short position on the debt of Vedanta Resources, saying that it resembles a 'Ponzi scheme'. It called the parent company of Vedanta a ""parasite holding company with no significant operations of its own, propped up entirely by cash extracted from its dying host, Vedanta Limited"". The American short-seller had alleged that Hindustan Zinc's resources are being ""looted"" through related-party deals with promoter-family owned companies and unjustifiable brand fees. ""Vedanta's crown jewel may be its biggest liability,"" it said while speaking about Hindustan Zinc.

Glenmark Pharma shares rally 15% to record high after mega licensing deal for its cancer drug,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/glenmark-pharma-shares-jump-10-to-record-high-after-mega-licensing-deal-for-its-cancer-drug-13265630.html,"The shares of Glenmark Pharma jumped 15 percent to hit a fresh 52-week high record on July 11. This comes after the company announced that its subsidiary has signed an exclusive global licensing agreement for its investigational asset ISB 2001 with New York-based AbbVie. In an exchange filing released in the post market hours of July 10, Glenmark announced that its step-down wholly-owned subsidiary, Ichnos Glenmark Innovation (IGI), has signed the agreement with AbbVie. ISB 2001 is currently in the first phase of clinical trials for patients suffering from relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, a type of cancer, the company said in an exchange filing. As part of the deal, AbbVie will get the exclusive right to develop, manufacture, and commercialise ISB 2001 across North America, Europe, Japan, and China. Glenmark will meanwhile develop, manufacture and lead commercialization of ISB 2001 across Emerging Markets including the rest of Asia, Latin America, the Russia/CIS region, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, New Zealand and South Korea. Glenmark's subsidiary will get an upfront payment of $700 million, and will be eligible to receive up to $1.225 billion in development, regulatory, and commercial milestone payments, along with tiered, double-digit royalties on net sales, as part of the deal. The pact was signed by IGI Therapeutics SA, a wholly owned subsidiary of Ichnos Glenmark Innovation, Inc., which is a subsidiary of Glenmark Pharmaceuticals. The US Food and Drug Administration had granted ISB 2001 orphan drug designation in July 2003 and fast-track designation in May for the treatment of relapsed or refractory myeloma patients. “Multispecifics including trispecific antibodies represent a new frontier in immuno-oncology with the potential to deliver deeper, more durable responses by engaging multiple targets simultaneously,” said Roopal Thakkar, M.D., Executive Vice-President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer, AbbVie. “This partnership with IGI reflects our unwavering commitment to advancing novel therapies for patients with multiple myeloma, a disease where significant unmet need remains despite recent progress,” Thakkar added. “ISB 2001 exemplifies the potential of our BEAT® protein platform to generate effective multispecificsTM that may overcome resistance and improve outcomes in hard-to-treat cancers,” said Cyril Konto, M.D., President and CEO of IGI. ""This agreement marks a defining milestone in IGI’s scientific journey and reflects our team’s deep commitment to delivering meaningful therapies for patients. Our partnership with AbbVie accelerates ISB 2001’s path to patients and sharpens our focus on advancing the next generation of BEAT®-enabled assets in oncology.” Glenmark Pharma shares have so far gained over 14 percent in the past five days, and more than 28 percent in the past one month. The stock gained nearly 40 percent in the past six months, and over 51 percent in the past one year. Nomura has kept a ''neutral' call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 1,500 per share. This implies a downside potential of more than 21 percent from the stock’s previous closing price of Rs 1,904 apiece. The brokerage said that the licensing deal is the largest by any Indian pharma company. The deal value has also beat its expectations.

Tata Elxsi stock falls 7% after weak Q1; brokerages turn bearish on growth outlook,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/tata-elxsi-stock-falls-7-after-weak-q1-brokerages-turn-bearish-on-growth-outlook-13264920.html,"Shares of Tata Elxsi slipped as much as 7 percent to Rs 5,660 in morning trade on Friday, July 11, after the company reported a sharp drop in June quarter earnings, triggering concerns over demand headwinds and margin pressure. The disappointing performance also prompted global brokerages to cut estimates and maintain bearish views on the stock. Morgan Stanley retained its Underweight rating with a target price of Rs 4,660, implying a downside potential of 24 percent from the last close on the NSE. The brokerage said the company missed expectations despite low investor forecasts. While management remained hopeful of a recovery led by auto and media verticals, analysts flagged that the stock has outperformed peers despite an ongoing earnings downgrade cycle. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates JPMorgan also reiterated an Underweight call, lowering its target to Rs 3,800. It highlighted that this was the fourth consecutive quarter of revenue and margin miss. The brokerage expects auto deal ramp-ups to be gradual and flagged lingering tariff-related uncertainty in the US market. It expects telecom to return to growth from Q2 but trimmed FY26–28 earnings estimates by 3–5 percent. Tata Elxsi posted a 22 percent year-on-year decline in net profit at Rs 144 crore for Q1FY26, compared to Rs 184 crore a year ago. Revenue fell 3.7 percent to Rs 892 crore, dragged by weakness in the automotive and transportation segment, which makes up over half its top line.

Trump announced a 35 percent levy on Canadian imports starting August 1 and signalled sweeping duties of 15–20 percent on most trade partners, shaking investor sentiment. Adding to the pressure, TCS shares slipped after posting a subdued Q1 performance, while the broader market was largely flat. At about 10:30 am, the Sensex was down 458.98 points or 0.55 percent at 82,731.30, and the Nifty was down 127.40 points or 0.50 percent at 25,227.85. About 1306 shares advanced, 1889 shares declined, and 141 shares unchanged. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates ""There is uncertainty surrounding President Trump's trade policies, as he continues to threaten elevated tariffs across various sectors and countries. Most recently, his decision to slap 35 percent tariffs on Canada has also hampered sentiment,"" Devarsh Vakil, Head of Prime Research at HDFC Securities, said. The nearly 2 percent drop in TCS has deepened concerns around the broader Q1 earnings season, with experts flagging limited clarity on growth prospects for FY26 for the IT major. Brokerages noted that the company’s constant currency growth missed street expectations, and cautioned that a meaningful margin improvement over the rest of the year appears unlikely.

Banking stocks remained under pressure, with Nifty Bank down 0.35 percent, PSU Bank slipping 0.52 percent, and Private Bank easing 0.11 percent. Among the few gainers, FMCG rose 1.03 percent and Pharma added 0.78 percent. India VIX edged down 0.69 percent to 11.59, reflecting continued low volatility despite the broad-based selloff.

The disappointing performance also prompted global brokerages to cut estimates and maintain bearish views on the stock. Read more: How much did star fund manager Sankaran Naren take home in FY25? From a technical perspective, the 25,300 level is now a crucial make-or-break point; a sustained close below this could further weaken the chart structure. On the flip side, the 25,550–25,600 zone continues to attract selling pressure, marking a critical resistance area that needs to be crossed for any sustainable up move. Additionally, Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) are aggressively increasing their short positions in index futures, indicating caution from institutional participants. Until there's evidence of short covering or long buildup by FPIs, upside momentum is expected to remain limited. HUL, Nestle, Asian Paints, Sun Pharma and SBI Life Insurance were the top gainers on the Nifty. Laggards on the index included TCS, M&M, Wipro, Bharat Electronics, and Apollo Hospitals.

"Glenmark’s R&D bet pays off handsomely with AbbVie deal, vindicating backer-in-chief Saldanha",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/glenmark-s-r-d-bet-pays-off-handsomely-with-abbvie-deal-vindicating-backer-in-chief-saldanha-13261705.html,"Glenmark Pharmaceuticals chairman and managing director Glenn Saldanha has secured one of the largest global licensing deals for an Indian-origin biotech asset, a high-risk bet that not only proved naysayers wrong but also seems to have paid off really well. ISB 2001, a cancer treatment developed by Glenmark’s US-based subsidiary Ichnos Glenmark Innovation has been licensed to AbbVie for $700 million upfront. IGI could earn up to $1.225 billion in additional milestone payments, according to the agreement, which needs regulatory approvals. “This is not just a Glenmark moment — it’s an India moment,” Saldanha told media on July 10 evening following the deal announcement. “We’ve gone through blood, sweat, and tears to get here. This validates everything we’ve built,” he said. Just a year ago, the company had to sell some assets to pare debt and clean up its balance sheet. Its cash-heavy model didn’t sit too well with investors either. And then ISB 2001 happened. ISB 2001 targets relapsing multiple myeloma, a form of blood cancer that affects white blood cells. The drug has the potential to address a significant unmet need, especially in cases where patients have exhausted other lines of treatment. It is estimated that globally between 200,000 and 300,000 patients suffer from multiple myeloma. The milestone payments hinge on successful clinical trials such as completion of Phase 1, 2, and Phase 3, regulatory nods and commercial outcomes such as launches in specific markets, sales thresholds or market share. Globally, the ISB 2001 deal ranks third-largest in terms of upfront payment size for a multi-specific or bispecific asset in the last two years, placing it in elite company alongside two agreements involving China’s 3SBio licensing its PD-1 asset to Pfizer for $1.25 billion, with milestone payments potentially reaching $4.8 billion plus royalties on sales. The other is BioNTech – BMS licensing deal worth $11.1 billion, including upfront and milestone payments. High risk, high cash burn Glenmark's high-risk, high-cash-burn research and development model didn't resonate well with most Indian investors and analysts. The Mumbai-based firm has an impressive track record of building brands domestically and has a sizeable presence in the US and Europe. Nine of its brands, including Candid, Ascoril, and Telma, are among the top 300 in India by sales but the company has struggled with high debt and sub-20 EBITDA margins, way below the industry standard. It had to sell some good assets, including its API business to Nirma in March 2024, which allowed the company to clean up the balance sheet, lowering the net debt to around Rs 400 crore. ""The challenge with India has always been that the capital markets are always short-term focused. So, there's always pressure on showing higher margins, getting better valuation, getting better market cap. And that's contrary to spending in innovation.” Saldanha said. “Innovation is the long gestation period capital that you're putting aside every year, with a view that something will culminate down the road.” What’s different this time? ISB 2001, developed using IGI’s proprietary BEAT multispecific antibody platform, targets BCMA and CD38 on myeloma cells and CD3 on T cells. It showed a 79 percent overall response rate and 30 percent complete response in heavily pre-treated multiple myeloma patients in Phase 1 trials, earning Orphan Drug Designation and Fast Track status from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Unlike previous efforts, Glenmark focused its resources on a single, high-potential asset. “We shut down other programmes and bet big on ISB 2001,” said Saldanha. “All it takes is one asset to transform a company — just look at Keytruda.” He was referring to American drug firm Merck’s Keytruda (pembrolizumab), which is the top selling cancer drug globally, generating $29.5 billion in sales in 2024 alone. Behind the scenes The work on licensing deal between IGI and AbbVie for ISB 2001 began in earnest in January 2025 during the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference — the global event for biotech dealmaking. Following the presentation of promising Phase 1 data at American Society of Hematology (ASH) in late 2024, IGI scouting for potential partners. Compelling clinical data — a 79 percent overall response rate and 30 percent complete response —sparked interest among several global pharma companies. Negotiations with AbbVie intensified after the ASCO 2025 presentation, which further validated ISB 2001’s efficacy and safety profile. Over the next six months, IGI and AbbVie engaged in rigorous due diligence, contracting, and strategic discussions, culminating into licensing deal. What next? AbbVie will now lead global development and commercialisation in North America, Europe, Japan, and Greater China. Glenmark retains rights for Emerging Markets, including India, Latin America, and Africa. The molecule remains in Phase 1 dose expansion, with commercialisation expected in four to five years, subject to regulatory progress. Glenmark will remain deeply involved through joint committees and retain commercial rights in key geographies, Saldanha said. “It’s a partnership not a hands-off,” he said. The Rs 6,000 crore upfront payment will make IGI self-funded for at least three years, reducing pressure to launch IPO immediately. “We’ll time the IGI IPO based on market conditions,” Saldanha noted. “But we’re now debt-free and have the flexibility to reward shareholders.” While no acquisitions are planned yet, Glenmark will continue investing in innovation. “We’re not stepping away from R&D. We’ll do globally relevant work,” he said. Beyond ISB 2001 IGI’s pipeline includes ISB 2301, another multi-specific antibody targeting NK cells, which is expected to enter clinical trials next year. Two monoclonal antibody programmes in dermatology are also partnered and progressing. “We’re building a portfolio, not just a one-hit wonder,” said Saldanha. “We’ve always believed in moving up the value chain,” said Saldanha. “This is just the beginning.”","Globally, the ISB 2001 deal ranks third-largest in terms of upfront payment size for a multi-specific or bispecific asset in the last two years, placing it in elite company alongside two agreements involving China’s 3SBio licensing its PD-1 asset to Pfizer for $1.25 billion, with milestone payments potentially reaching $4.8 billion plus royalties on sales.","Globally, the ISB 2001 deal ranks third-largest in terms of upfront payment size for a multi-specific or bispecific asset in the last two years, placing it in elite company alongside two agreements involving China’s 3SBio licensing its PD-1 asset to Pfizer for $1.25 billion, with milestone payments potentially reaching $4.8 billion plus royalties on sales.","Glenmark Pharmaceuticals chairman and managing director Glenn Saldanha has secured one of the largest global licensing deals for an Indian-origin biotech asset, a high-risk bet that not only proved naysayers wrong but also seems to have paid off really well.","Globally, the ISB 2001 deal ranks third-largest in terms of upfront payment size for a multi-specific or bispecific asset in the last two years, placing it in elite company alongside two agreements involving China’s 3SBio licensing its PD-1 asset to Pfizer for $1.25 billion, with milestone payments potentially reaching $4.8 billion plus royalties on sales."
"Sensex, Nifty eye weak start as Trump tariff jitters resurface; key levels to track on July 11",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sensex-nifty-eye-weak-start-as-trump-tariff-jitters-resurface-key-levels-to-track-on-july-11-13264639.html,"Benchmark indices Nifty and Sensex are set for a weak start on July 11, likely extending their losing streak to a third straight session, after fresh tariff threats from US President Donald Trump rattled global sentiment. Trump announced a 35 percent tariff on Canadian imports starting August 1 and hinted at blanket duties of 15 to 20 percent on most trade partners, reigniting fears of a global trade war. At approximately 7:55 a.m., the GIFT Nifty was trading at 25,283, down 127 points or 0.5 per cent. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates In the previous session, equity indices were weighed down by heightened volatility typical of the weekly derivatives expiry. On the sectoral front, the Nifty IT index emerged as the biggest drag, with heavyweights such as Infosys, Wipro, TCS, and Tech Mahindra slipping. Analysts warned that the IT sector may witness a tepid earnings season. On July 10, both Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) and domestic institutional investors (DIIs) were net buyers. DIIs net bought Rs 221 crore in Indian equities while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) net bought Rs 591 crore, according to provisional data on NSE. Here are the key levels to watch out for in today's session The 25,300 level is now a crucial make-or-break point; a sustained close below this could further weaken the chart structure. On the flip side, the 25,550–25,600 zone continues to attract selling pressure, marking a critical resistance area that needs to be crossed for any sustainable up move. Additionally, Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) are aggressively increasing their short positions in index futures, indicating caution from institutional participants. Until there's evidence of short covering or long buildup by FPIs, upside momentum is expected to remain limited. ""A firm hurdle has formed near 57,350, where selling pressure has repeatedly emerged. Unless the index closes above this resistance zone, a sustained bullish reversal appears unlikely,"" says Dhupesh Dhameja of SAMCO Securities. ""Price action remains indecisive, oscillating between the 10-day and 20-day EMAs. The index continues to consolidate within a narrow 500-point band (56,800–57,300), with muted institutional participation. A close below the key support at 56,770 could weaken the structure further, while a sustained move above 57,350 is needed to signal strength. Adding to the cautious outlook, FPIs have been consistently short on index futures, pointing to persistent supply pressure at higher levels,"" he added. India VIX slipped 2.24 percent to close at 11.67, remaining well below the psychological mark of 15. This low-volatility regime points to muted investor fear and favours a slow, grinding market rather than volatile price swings. However, it also reflects indecision and a lack of strong directional conviction. The Put-Call Ratio (PCR) remained steady at 0.69, underscoring a bearish tilt due to elevated call writing.

A total of 1,443 shares saw a correction compared to 1,196 shares that gained on the NSE. The market is expected to see further consolidation with a negative bias in the upcoming sessions. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Mandar Bhojane, Senior Equity Research Analyst at Choice Broking Prestige Estates Projects | CMP: Rs 1,696.5 Prestige Estates Projects has recently formed a Cup and Handle pattern on the daily chart with strong volume participation, indicating rising bullish interest. A decisive close above Rs 1,750 would confirm the pattern breakout and could open up a fresh upside rally. The immediate support is placed at Rs 1,640, making it a strong accumulation zone for traders looking to enter on dips. The RSI stands at 61.15 and is trending upward, reflecting improving momentum and increasing buying pressure. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,000, Rs 2,100 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,580 Sterling and Wilson Renewable Energy | CMP: Rs 336.55 Sterling and Wilson Renewable Energy saw a decisive breakout from a Cup and Handle formation on the daily chart. The move, backed by a noticeable rise in volumes, suggests that bulls are regaining control and a trend shift may already be underway. Momentum is building, with the RSI at 65.9, trending upward and reflecting growing strength without entering overbought territory. The Rs 320 level stands out as a strong base and could act as a buy-on-dips zone. With the price holding above the breakout zone, sustained momentum could lead to targets of Rs 400 and Rs 420 in the short term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 400, Rs 420 Stop-Loss: Rs 310 Jay Mehta, Technical Research at JM Financial Services IndiaMart InterMesh | CMP: Rs 2,586.2 IndiaMart InterMesh has formed an inverse Head-and-Shoulders pattern on the daily chart—a bullish reversal pattern—and it has already given a breakout above the pattern. On June 25, the stock formed a bullish gap, and it is currently retesting this gap while finding support at the 20-day EMA, indicating potential for a continuation of the upward trend. A move above Rs 2,661 could accelerate the bullish momentum. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,750, Rs 2,980 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,387 Ingersoll Rand (India) | CMP: Rs 4,178.9 Ingersoll Rand (India) has broken above a trendline resistance in place since the high of November 26, 2024. After three unsuccessful attempts this week, marked by consolidative spinning top candlestick patterns, it achieved a breakout today with positive volume confirmation, signaling potential for further upside. Momentum indicators are exhibiting strong bullish strength. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 4,350, Rs 4,450 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,990 JSW Energy | CMP: Rs 530.55 JSW Energy has broken out of a triangular consolidation pattern on the daily chart, accompanied by a surge in positive volume. The stock has found support near its 20-day and 50-day EMAs, confirming bullish strength. A move above Rs 545 could further fuel the upward momentum. The momentum indicator is in a bullish zone, with a positive crossover signaling growing bullish strength. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 578, Rs 600 Stop-Loss: Rs 509 Dhupesh Dhameja, Derivatives Research Analyst at Samco Securities Premier Energies | CMP: Rs 1,115.8 Premier Energies is on the verge of a breakout from a classic Cup and Handle formation, signaling a potential reversal of its prior downtrend and laying the groundwork for the next leg of upward momentum. The pattern is accompanied by a notable surge in volumes, confirming the breakout. Interestingly, volume participation remained muted during the pattern formation—an ideal setup often seen before a sharp price-volume expansion—which now reflects renewed investor interest. The stock is trading firmly above its 20-day EMA, and the daily RSI has climbed above 60, reinforcing the bullish momentum. These technical indicators suggest growing strength and support the likelihood of a sustained rally. Traders may consider initiating long positions at the current market price or on dips toward Rs 1,105. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,255 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,030 EID Parry India | CMP: Rs 1,109.8 EID Parry India is displaying impressive relative strength, outperforming the benchmark index and trading near its record high. The stock has confirmed a breakout from a classic Flag and Pole continuation pattern, signaling the potential for a further rally into uncharted territory. The breakout is validated by a sharp surge in trading volumes following a period of subdued activity during the pattern formation—an ideal setup that often precedes significant price expansion. This volume-price action suggests renewed buying interest and strengthening bullish sentiment. Technically, the stock is comfortably trading above its upward-sloping 20-day EMA, while the daily RSI continues to hold above the 60 mark, reinforcing the ongoing momentum and increasing the probability of sustained upside. Traders may consider entering long positions at the current market price or on dips toward Rs 1,095. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,200 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,054 Adani Power | CMP: Rs 605.8 Adani Power has decisively broken out of an ascending triangle pattern, marking a key technical shift as the stock exits its accumulation phase and trades well above its neckline. This breakout also signals early signs of a reversal from its prolonged downtrend, suggesting the potential beginning of a fresh markup phase. The move is backed by a notable surge in trading volumes, following a period of subdued participation during the pattern formation—a classic setup that often precedes sharp price expansion. The strong volume confirms renewed buying interest and builds a solid foundation for sustained upward momentum. From a technical perspective, the daily RSI has sustained above the 60 mark for the first time in nearly a year, further validating the bullish reversal and increasing confidence in a continued rally. The stock is now well-positioned for a strong uptrend in the sessions ahead. Traders may consider initiating long positions at the current market price or on dips toward Rs 598.

SEBI did not estimate the exact investor losses but warned that such activity distorts market prices, erodes investor trust, and causes financial harm to large clients who get poorer execution rates. The trades in question were originally done by Mehrangarh Financial Advisors Pvt Ltd (MFAPL), which later merged with APWPPL. The firm allegedly traded KPIT Technologies shares on July 26, 2017, based on non-public client information accessed through Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers. Here’s how it played out: MFAPL sold shares at around Rs 123.73, just before the big client placed its sell order. As soon as the client’s order hit the market and prices dropped, MFAPL bought the shares back at around Rs 120.20. The company made a profit of Rs 3.53 per share on 5.52 lakh shares in a single day. SEBI concluded that the firm had used privileged information to gain an unfair advantage in the market.

Click to View More Outlook for July 11 Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities Nifty slipped lower following a breakdown from the congestion zone on the daily chart, reinforcing the prevailing bearish sentiment. Additionally, the index has moved below the 21-hour exponential moving average. The RSI (14) on the daily chart has also turned negative, indicating weakening momentum. In the short term, the trend is likely to remain weak, which could lead to further downside. On the lower end, support is placed at 25,250–25,200, while on the higher end, resistance levels are seen at 25,400 and 25,500. Aditya Gaggar Director of Progressive Shares Today's trade was dominated by bears. After a muted start, the market witnessed a one-sided move toward the south, ultimately ending the session at 25,355.25 with a notable loss of 120.85 points. Except for the Realty and Metal, all other sectors closed in negative territory, with IT and PSU Banking being the major laggards. The broader markets outperformed the Frontline Index, as the Midcap and Smallcap segments managed to restrict their corrections. Over the past few sessions, the level of 25,400 had acted as a strong support; however, it was breached in today’s trade, though a confirmatory move is required. If the downward momentum continues, the correction could extend further toward the 25,200 mark, while resistance is now seen lower at 25,520. Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets edged lower and lost nearly half a percent on the weekly expiry day. After a flat start, the Nifty gradually drifted lower as the session progressed and finally settled near the day’s low, around the 25,355.25 mark. On the sectoral front, profit booking in IT majors ahead of TCS results weighed on the index, followed closely by weakness in FMCG and pharma stocks. However, the realty and metal sectors bucked the trend and closed in the green. The broader indices also ended with modest losses, continuing their profit-taking phase. Markets will react to TCS’s earnings in early trade, with a keen eye on management commentary, which could set the initial tone. With the Nifty now hovering near its immediate and crucial support zone—marked by the 20-day exponential moving average (20-DEMA) and the upper boundary of its previous consolidation range around the 25,200–25,300 zone—it will be critical for the index to hold this level to maintain its positive bias. That said, with the earnings season underway, stock-specific opportunities are likely to emerge on both sides, so participants should align their positions accordingly.

The subdued mood also reflected a lack of fresh triggers, as investors awaited the start of the June-quarter earnings season with TCS’s results and monitored progress on the long-pending India–US trade deal. At the close, the Sensex was down 345.80 points or 0.41 percent at 83,190.28, and the Nifty was down 120.85 points or 0.47 percent at 25,355.25. About 1919 shares advanced, 1947 shares declined, and 140 shares remained unchanged. Also read: Merchant bankers are gearing up for a ‘beauty parade’ in anticipation of NSE’s IPO On the sectoral front, Nifty IT emerged as the biggest drag, with heavyweights like Infosys, Wipro, TCS, and Tech Mahindra slipping. Analysts warned that the IT sector may witness a tepid earnings season, hurt by global macroeconomic uncertainties. Brokerage Equirius Capital expects TCS’s US revenues to decline sequentially by about 0.4 percent in constant currency terms for the quarter, citing headwinds from the ramp-down of the BSNL deal and weaker international sales growth. Nifty PSU Bank index was also one of the worst performers, falling 0.77 percent, followed by Nifty IT and Nifty Pharma, which declined 0.82 percent and 0.59 percent, respectively. Nifty Bank and Nifty FMCG also slipped 0.41 percent and 0.55 percent. On the broader front, the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices dropped 0.29 percent and 0.28 percent, respectively.

Volatility remained subdued as India VIX declined over 2 percent to 11.68. Looking ahead, Manish Sonthalia, Director & CIO at Emkay Investment Managers, maintained a positive medium-term view despite near-term volatility, describing it as “unequivocally a buy-on-dips market.” “I believe investors who buy into this dip will benefit from tailwinds expected in Q3 and Q4. We see Nifty 50 earnings growth in Q1FY26 at around 3–8 percent. While markets could overshoot on the upside, this volatility is an opportunity to accumulate select stocks,” he said. On the technical side, Vaishali Parekh, VP – Technical Research at Prabhudas Lilladher Capital, noted that volatility could intensify as the results season unfolds. “The index has strong support in the 25,250–25,300 zone, which needs to hold. On the upside, a decisive break above 25,650 could trigger a fresh rally, opening the path to targets of 25,700 and 26,200 in the coming sessions,” she added.

"IPO-bound Anthem Bio says cost arbitrage drove expansion, proposing China alternative for global pharma",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/ipo-bound-anthem-bio-says-cost-arbitrage-drove-expansion-proposing-china-alternate-for-global-pharma-13257667.html,"IPO-bound Anthem Biosciences, a Bengaluru-based contract research development and manufacturing firm (CRDMO), will be the second such player to debut on stock exchanges in less than a year, and has positioned itself as a key alternative to global biotech and pharma majors in diversifying their supply chains. The management told Moneycontrol that it is now the second source for many Chinese products, and one of the fastest-growing CRDMOs in India. “We’re now the second source for many products made in China, and the first choice for new ones,” Ajay Bhardwaj, CEO and Founder of Anthem told Moneycontrol in an interview. Anthem’s IPO, opening on July 14, is a pure offer-for-sale of Rs 3,395 crore in which the private equity investor True North will be offloading shares along with promoters trimming stakes slightly. Post-listing, promoter holding will remain above 74%. In December, Hyderabad-based Sai Life Sciences had completed a successful IPO - oversubscribed more than ten times - with institutional investors showing strong interest, betting on the sector's tailwinds. Since then, Sai Life has gained around 19% from its listing price of Rs 660 per share to trade near Rs 784.90 on BSE on July 10. The supply chain diversification by global pharma, in addition to India’s scientific capabilities and cost arbitrage, made Anthem the fastest-growing CRDMO with revenue growing at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 24.8% and EBITDA growth of almost 30% in the last five financial years. The company ended FY25 with revenue of Rs 1844.6 crore and an EBITDA margin of 36.8%. Among CRDMOs, Divi’s Laboratories led the pack with revenue of Rs 9,360 crore, and an EBITDA margin of 31.7% with a net profit of Rs 2,191 crore in FY25. Divi’s was followed by Syngene International with a revenue of Rs 3,642 crore, EBITDA margin of 29% and a net profit of Rs 496 crore. Sai Life Sciences recorded revenue of Rs 1,642 crore, an EBITDA margin of 24%, and net profit of Rs 173 crore and Cohance Lifesciences posted revenue of Rs 1,198 crore, an EBITDA margin of 31.3%, and net profit of Rs 265 crore. Divi’s and Cohance’s revenues also comes from active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) manufacturing, along with CDMO. How Did it all Start? Anthem Biosciences began its journey in 2006, with Ajay Bhardwaj, Ganesh Sambasivam, and K Ravindra Chandrappa as founders, who were all colleagues at Biocon and its subsidiary Syngene. Bhardwaj, while leaving Biocon in 2006, had a chance conversation with Dinesh (a colleague from Syngene) which sparked the idea of starting a company. Bhardwaj recollects their vision was to build a ‘company that does things differently, instead of replicating products or clients’ from previous pharma employers.""We targetted small biotech firms that were under-served by larger CRDMOs, offering a fee-for-service (FFS) model - where clients pay only upon delivery - rather than the traditional full-time equivalent (FTE) model where clients are billed on the number of work hours,"" Bhardwaj said. Its early bet on combining synthetic chemistry with fermentation and enzymatic processes paid off, enabling it to lead in complex modalities like peptides, ADCs, and oligonucleotides. Capacity Expansion While global pharma companies are jittery about outsourcing research and manufacturing of their prized assets to Chinese CRDMOs due to potential data or intellectual property (IP) breaches - in addition to supply chain disruptions and uncertainties of trade war – yet Chinese CRDMOs score over Indian companies in terms of capacity and execution speed, industry executives have said. Bhardwaj said Anthem is attempting to meet this demand and is expanding aggressively with a capex investment of Rs 451.4 crore. The Unit III (NeoAnthem) is operational, and the unit IV is under construction on a 30-acre site at Harohalli, Karnataka, which will support both small and large molecule programs. Anthem’s proposed Unit V is planned in Hosur. By FY26, the company’s fermentation capacity is expected to reach 182 KL, and custom synthesis at 425 KL. The company said it is sitting on a net cash of Rs 622.8 crore to fund this expansion. Anthem’s client base includes more than 550 pharma and biotech firms, with top 5 customers contributing 70% of revenue, point towards concentration risk. “These are sticky relationships,” CFO Mohammed Gawir Baig said. “We’re embedded in their filings, their IP, their future.” More than half of Anthem revenue comes from US, followed by Europe, India and rest of Asia. The company’s facilities have passed multiple USFDA, PMDA, and TGA inspections with zero observations.","Divi’s was followed by Syngene International with a revenue of Rs 3,642 crore, EBITDA margin of 29% and a net profit of Rs 496 crore.","Sai Life Sciences recorded revenue of Rs 1,642 crore, an EBITDA margin of 24%, and net profit of Rs 173 crore and Cohance Lifesciences posted revenue of Rs 1,198 crore, an EBITDA margin of 31.3%, and net profit of Rs 265 crore.","Anthem’s IPO, opening on July 14, is a pure offer-for-sale of Rs 3,395 crore in which the private equity investor True North will be offloading shares along with promoters trimming stakes slightly.","Sai Life Sciences recorded revenue of Rs 1,642 crore, an EBITDA margin of 24%, and net profit of Rs 173 crore and Cohance Lifesciences posted revenue of Rs 1,198 crore, an EBITDA margin of 31.3%, and net profit of Rs 265 crore."

"FMCG volume growth seen soft, early monsoon dented demand for summer-related products, says Axis Securities",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/fmcg-volume-growth-seen-soft-early-monsoon-dented-demand-for-summer-related-products-says-axis-securities-13258136.html,"The FMCG volume growth for the June quarter is expected to stay soft, as was the trend during the fourth quarter for the last fiscal, with rural India outperforming urban areas due to demand weakness, Axis Securities said in a note ahead of the earnings season, adding that early rains have hurt some of the summer season sales. Consumer companies also face stiff regional competition, a rising trend of D2C brands and inventory pressures in trade channels, which has been worsened by a summer season sale that has been largely muted, the note said. ""Summer-reliant categories such as beverages, ice cream, and talcum powder are likely to witness pressure this quarter,"" the note added, underscoring the impact of unseasonal rain and early monsoon. The note said investors can hope for a recovery in demand and consumer sentiment in the second half of the fiscal. ""Looking ahead, growth momentum is expected to be supported by monetary policy easing, income tax benefits, a healthy monsoon outlook, and government measures aimed at boosting disposable incomes, which could uplift consumer sentiment and drive demand recovery by H2FY26,"" said Axis Securities. Not just volumes, even margins could stay subdued during the June quarter earnings, owing to 'elevated raw material inventory costs and subdued operating leverage', however, easing input prices could provide margin relief from Q2FY26 onward, said the Axis note. In this context, the note has underscored Britannia and DOMS Industries to outperform peers in the FMCG pack in the June quarter earnings, while Trent and D-Mart could do well in the retail space. This is likely on account of a recovery in smaller towns which could help value retailers such as D-Mart while premium retailers like Trent and Ethos are expected to maintain growth momentum. Axis Securities said it expects Britannia to report 8% YoY revenue growth along with a 5% volume growth during the June quarter. Investors should also watch out for the effectiveness of recent price hikes, a crucial factor which will need to be monitored in the coming quarters.

"Bharat Dynamics, GRSE, HAL, other defence stocks decline up to 3%: Here are the likely triggers",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/bharat-dynamics-grse-hal-other-defence-stocks-decline-up-to-3-here-are-the-likely-triggers-13257810.html,"Defence stocks tumbled in trade today, buoyed by several factors. The sharp fall in the share prices pushed the Nifty India Defence index down nearly 1.4 percent to hover around 8,739 in the morning. After a significant rally, defence stocks have seen significant volatility recently. While geopolitical tensions around the globe fuel the sentiment, analysts flag elevated valuations and lack of fresh triggers. Motilal Oswal gives 'Neutral' rating to BDL shares Bharat Dynamics (BDL) shares were the top loser on the index, dropping over 3 percent to trade at Rs 1,917 apiece. This comes after Motilal Oswal Financial Services initiated coverage on the stock with a 'Neutral' rating and a target price of Rs 1,900 apiece. This implies a downside potential of more than 4 percent from the stock's previous closing price of Rs 1,985 apiece. ""We like the business model of BDL and its ability to scale up its revenues and order book in current scenario, however, with fair valuations, we would look for lower price points to enter the stock,"" the brokerage said. It expects the firm's revenue growth to rebound and benefit from emergency procurement pipeline. Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers (GRSE) shares followed, dropping over 3 percent to trade at Rs 2,890 apiece. While the stock has dropped nearly 11 percent in the past one month, it has rallied over 96 percent in the past six months. Data Patterns and Zen Technologies shares plunged over 2 percent each, while Solar Industries, Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) and Cochin Shipyard shares declined over 2 percent each. Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders, Bharat Electronics (BEL) and Paras Defence shares were down over 0.6 percent, while those of BEML were trading in the red with marginal losses. Concerns over elevated valuations The defence stocks have been in focus on hopes of higher order inflows, after the Indian military conducted targeted strikes against terrorist outfits in Pakistan under the codename 'Operation Sindoor' in May. As the geopolitical tensions between India and Pakistan eased, the escalations in Russia-Ukraine war continued to support the rally in defence stocks. The rise in tensions between Israel and Iran further boosted the stocks. However, analysts have mixed views regarding the space, with some flagging elevated valuations in these stocks. Easing geopolitical tensions The fall in the defence stocks also comes on the back of overall easing geopolitical tensions. US President Donald Trump had hinted at a possible Gaza ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas this week. This comes amid Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s visit to US. Earlier, the easing tensions between Iran and Israel after significant escalations in the oil-rich middle east, had pushed down the stocks. Profit booking after record rally Defence stocks may have also dropped as investors booked profits at elevated levels. The stocks have seen significant surge in 2025 so far. BDL shares have gained over 69 percent this year, while those of jumped 75 percent. HAL shares are up 19 percent while Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders shares are up nearly 46 percent.

Over the past several years, JKCE has evolved into a structurally stronger business, outperforming peers. The company has a robust pipeline and aims to expand its capacity to 50mtpa by FY30. This target will be achieved through a mix of greenfield and brownfield expansions, with strategic opportunities in Jaisalmer, Muddapur, Panna. In order to drive operation efficiency, the company plans to reduce costs, continue to increase the share of blended cement, use more green energy, and leverage digitalization and automation.

The company aspires to be among the top quartile of sustainable, low-cost cement producers in the industry. Outlook We estimate its EBITDA/t at INR1,210/INR1,230/INR1,280 in FY26/FY27/FY28 vs. INR1,010 in FY25 (avg. INR1,090 over FY20-24).

"Jane Street unlikely to get any immediate relief against SEBI order, say legal experts",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/jane-street-unlikely-to-get-any-immediate-relief-against-sebi-order-say-legal-experts-13257718.html,"Global high frequency trading major Jane Street, which is planning to challenge the SEBI order banning it from the Indian markets, is unlikely to get an immediate relief though an appeal could lead to a time bound final order being passed by the regulator, say legal experts. Lawyers specialising in securities market matters further add that since the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has passed an interim order, the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) could, without providing any kind of stay order, direct the regulator to pass a final order within a specified period. SAT is the designated tribunal to appeal against orders issued by the capital market regulator. “At the appeal stage, the first outcome could be a direction to SEBI for a time bound disposal in the form of a final order,” said Jayesh H, co-founder, Juris Corp Advocates & Solicitors. “It is highly unlikely that the order is completely set aside as even the Supreme Court has ruled that SEBI has powers to issue interim ex-parte orders in instances where there is market wide ramifications and irrevocable damage could be done if SEBI were to not issue such orders,” he added. Also Read: Jane Street leveraged India entity to breach FPI rules, powering trading strategy for alleged illicit gains In an order issued on Friday last week, SEBI banned Jane Street and its India arms from trading in Indian securities, and sought to impound Rs 4,843.5 crore in alleged unlawful gains linked to expiry-day manipulation using cash and futures trades to distort options pricing. As per SEBI, Jane Street made a profit of Rs 36,671 crore between January 2023 and March 2025. “Matters related to market manipulation are tricky ones and at this stage, SEBI only has to show ‘enough’ to convince the tribunal that something wrong has happened and it is working towards final disposal of the matter,” said another lawyer on conditions of anonymity. “There have been instances in the past when SAT has directed SEBI to issue a final order while giving a specified period of time and also giving the affected party an opportunity to present their case in front of the regulator. It is highly likely that the same logic would be applied to this matter as well,” he added. Incidentally, SEBI in its order has emphasised on the allegations related to market manipulation and fraudulent trades. The order states that Jane Street resorted to undertaking prima facie manipulative ‘extended marking the close’ trading pattern on the index and constituent stocks towards the close on expiry day, so as to influence and manipulate the index for illegal advantage. Also Read: Criminal prosecution against Jane Street? Sebi Act empowers watchdog to seek fine and imprisonment of up to 10 years Meanwhile, Sumit Agrawal, Founder, Regstreet Law Advisors and a former legal officer of SEBI, is of the view that while the interim order is rich in detail and reflects SEBI’s broader concerns about trading behaviour around derivatives expiry, the legal threshold for proving market manipulation under Indian law is quite high. “The order leans significantly on circumstantial indicators like timing and market impact, but absent clear evidence of intent or artificial price creation, those arguments may not be legally decisive,” says Agrawal. Jane Street, on its part, has already disputed the allegations in SEBI’s interim order, and has communicated to its staff that it will challenge the regulatory ban. In a communique to its employees, it said that the trades under question were “basic index arbitrage trading”, adding that it was “beyond disappointed” by what it called “extremely inflammatory” accusations by SEBI, and is working on a formal response. “Jane Street may argue that its actions formed part of a legitimate, rule-based trading model designed for hedging or liquidity management. It could also point to the transparent execution of trades via the exchange, and stress the lack of intent to mislead or cause artificial price movement. Additionally, there may be questions raised about procedural fairness, given the ex-parte nature of the order,” said Agrawal while adding that if the global high frequency trading major can establish that the trading was lawful and not intended to distort the market, relief from SAT is certainly within the realm of possibility.

Additionally, the weekly expiry could add to the choppiness,"" Ajit Mishra, Senior Vice President at Religare Broking, said. Experts say that no announcement yet of a trade deal with the US has weighed on sentiment. Furthermore, Trump has also been dishing out new letters to countries for tariffs. ""Any added that any progress in finalising trade agreements over the coming weeks and months should reduce uncertainty, while any flexibility in lowering tariffs should help contain inflation and growth concerns,"" Devarsh Vakil, Head of Prime Research at HDFC Securities, said. Also read: Govt nudging big NBFCs to seek banking licence amid need for more banks NSE sectoral indices were largely in the red, with broad-based weakness across key segments. Nifty IT was the biggest laggard, falling 1 percent, followed by Pharma, Auto, and PSU Bank, which declined between 0.5–0.8 percent. Bank Nifty, FMCG, Infra, Energy, and Oil & Gas also slipped in the range of 0.2–0.4 percent, while the Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices were down 0.31 percent and 0.23 percent, respectively. On the positive side, Nifty Realty gained 0.43 percent, and Nifty Metal rose 0.29 percent. Meanwhile, India VIX edged up 1.17 percent, indicating a slight increase in market volatility. Shares of housing finance companies rose by up to 5 percent after Bernstein initiated coverage on four listed firms with a largely positive view on the sector, citing structural growth opportunities and business model resilience.

The newly-listed stock is currently over 32 percent higher than its IPO price. Crizac shares had listed at Rs 281 apiece on NSE on July 9, marking a premium of nearly 15 percent over its IPO price of Rs 245 apiece. Shares of Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA) rose over 2 percent ahead of its June quarter earnings announcement due later in the day. Its Q1 update showed that loan sanctions during the April–June period rose 28.5 percent year-on-year to Rs 11,740 crore, while disbursements grew 31.1 percent to Rs 6,981 crore, signalling continued momentum in the renewable energy financing space. ""The Nifty ended lower on Wednesday following a late-session selloff. Technically, the index failed to build on Tuesday’s ""bullish flag"" breakout, leaving the bullish setup unconfirmed. A decisive close above 25,548 is needed to validate the breakout and open the path towards 25,600, and potentially the recent swing high near 25,670,"" Akshay Chinchalkar, Head of Research at Axis Securities, said. Tata Steel, Jio Financial Services, Maruti Suzuki, Axis Bank, and UltraTech Cement were the top gainers on the Nifty. Laggards on the index included Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Cipla, Shriram Finance, and Wipro.

China's exports jump 5.8% in June as tariffs reprieve prompts a rush of orders,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/chinas-exports-jump-58-in-june-as-tariffs-reprieve-prompts-a-rush-of-orders-2025-07-13/,"BANGKOK (AP) — China’s exports accelerated in June as a reprieve on U.S. tariffs prompted a rush of orders by companies and consumers ahead of an August deadline. Exports climbed 5.8% from a year earlier, up from a 4.8% rise in May. Imports also recovered, growing 1.1% in the first increase so far this year, according to customs data released Monday. Exports to the United States fell 16%, but that was less than half the 34.5% drop seen in May. After U.S. President Donald Trump imposed tariffs of up to 245% on imports from China and Beijing responded with its own steep import duties, the two sides agreed to a truce to allow time for talks. The retailers and other importers that had largely halted shipments of shoes, clothes, toys, and other items due to new tariffs then resumed imports from China. But preliminary discussions between the two sides have yet to produce significant progress and sudden changes in policy have raised uncertainty for companies trying to plan ahead. In the meantime, the Trump administration has hiked tariffs on imports from China by 30%, pending an Aug. 12 deadline for reverting to the higher tariffs Washington and Beijing have delayed for now. The recovery in trade is expected to help boost economic growth in the April to June quarter. The Chinese government is due to report those figures on Tuesday. Still, the outlook is less upbeat, noted Zichun Huang of Capital Economics, noting that “tariffs are likely to remain high and Chinese manufacturers face growing constraints on their ability to rapidly expand global market share by slashing prices. “We therefore expect export growth to slow over the coming quarters, weighing on economic growth,” Huang said in a report. Data for the first six months of the year showed that while the trade war with the U.S. heated up following Trump's return to the White House, China's global trade kept growing. Total trade including exports and imports hit a record of more than 20 trillion yuan ($2.8 trillion) as Chinese businesses diversified their overseas production and export markets. China's global trade surplus in the first half of the year hit $586 billion. Exports to Southeast Asia grew 13% year-on-year in January to June, with shipments to Thailand up 22%, to Vietnam up nearly 20% and to India up more than 18%. Trade with Europe also was brisk, climbing 6.6% in the first half of the year from a year earlier. But auto exports fell after the European Union imposed higher tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles, sinking nearly 38% from a year earlier. Exports of auto parts fell more than 23%. ___ AP researcher Yu Bing in Beijing contributed.","In the meantime, the Trump administration has hiked tariffs on imports from China by 30%, pending an Aug. 12 deadline for reverting to the higher tariffs Washington and Beijing have delayed for now.","In the meantime, the Trump administration has hiked tariffs on imports from China by 30%, pending an Aug. 12 deadline for reverting to the higher tariffs Washington and Beijing have delayed for now.","But auto exports fell after the European Union imposed higher tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles, sinking nearly 38% from a year earlier.","Data for the first six months of the year showed that while the trade war with the U.S. heated up following Trump's return to the White House, China's global trade kept growing."
India wants air conditioners to be made with milder temperature settings to save energy,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/india-wants-air-conditioners-to-be-made-with-milder-temperature-settings-to-save-energy-2025-07-13/,"BENGALURU, India (AP) — India’s government is seeking to limit temperature settings on new air conditioners to save electricity in the country that considered the fastest-growing market for them. The power minister proposed a rule in June requiring air conditioners sold in the country to have thermostats that can be set no lower than 20 Celsius (68 Fahrenheit). Officials hope the small change will create massive energy savings in the country of more than 1.4 billion people. About 10 million to 15 million air conditioners are sold annually as incomes and urbanization increase along with the temperatures. The current lowest setting is 17 C (62 F). Officials say each degree an air conditioner is turned up saves about 6% on energy. Energy experts said the proposal is a positive step, but that requiring units to be more energy efficient would help more. Power Minister Manohar Lal Khattar said the proposed rule would take effect soon but wasn't specific about timing. The proposal has gotten mixed reviews from people living in India's sweltering cities. “Overall, I think it’s good to try and save energy, but at the same time I hope the government makes sure people are not too inconvenienced,” said Vikram Kannan, a 37-year-old teacher who lives in the humid southern city of Chennai with his wife and 4-year-old daughter. “Sometimes there is no choice but to set a low air conditioner temperature in cities like Chennai because it’s just way too hot and humid. My daughter gets heat pimples at times if we don’t do this."" Air conditioners are fast becoming some of the biggest energy guzzlers in India. Room air conditioners accounted for as much as one quarter of the electricity needed in India during times of the highest usage in 2024, a measure known as peak demand, according to estimates by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley. New AC units added between 2019 and 2024 have increased India’s peak demand by an amount roughly equivalent to what it would take to power New Delhi for a year, the researchers estimated. Energy demand is typically highest during the summer when temperatures can reach 51 degrees Celsius (124 degrees Fahrenheit) in parts of the country. If changes are not made, India is expected to have power shortages by next year. India’s hunger for energy is also a key reason the country is one of the highest emitters of planet-heating gases. Clean energy use is growing, but most of India’s electricity is provided by climate-polluting fossil fuels such as coal. Nikit Abhyankar, a leader of the India Energy and Climate Center at the University of California, Berkley, said that Delhi, like other major Indian cities, now experiences dual peaks in electricity use — one in the afternoon and another around midnight — driven largely by air conditioners. While solar energy can help offset daytime demand, nighttime cooling still relies heavily on fossil fuels. The air conditioner proposal is the latest in a series of government measures over the past decade aimed at saving energy, such as mandating that government offices be cooled at no less than 24 degrees Celsius (75 degrees Fahrenheit). In 2022, the government launched the Mission Life program that includes public service messages encouraging people to reduce emissions by cutting electricity use or skipping unnecessary car trips. The initiative announced with much fanfare has received mixed responses. Some are supportive of the proposed change to air conditioner settings. Sunil Kumar, a 47-year-old from East Delhi, said the rule could prevent fire hazards and lower bills. “People used to live without air conditioners. We can adjust,” said Kumar, who drives a small commercial vehicle known as a tuk-tuk. New Delhi-based businessperson Surjeet Singh said turning air conditioners down to their current lowest setting was “unnecessary.” “People have gotten too comfortable,” he said, suggesting that cities invest in planting trees to tackle urban heat. Abhyankar, the California professor, said that while changing temperature settings will help, requiring air conditioners to be energy efficient would do more. “Tightening the minimum efficiency standards can change things pretty significantly,” said Abhyankar, who has also studied the energy sector in the U.S., China, Indonesia and Vietnam. Calling the proposed air conditioner rule a “step in the right direction,” Pramod Singh, an energy savings expert with New Delhi-based Alliance for an Energy Efficient Economy, said replacing the country’s estimated 80 million older generation, inefficient air conditioners is a key challenge for the government. Many units available in India are so inefficient they couldn't be sold in many other countries, Abhyankar said. “Although India imports most key components for its air conditioners from China, nearly 80% of the air conditioners that are currently sold in India would be banned in China,” he said. Energy experts said other small changes can reduce energy use and customer costs, such as making sure new buildings have adequate ventilation, combining air conditioners with other cooling methods and using smart technologies to run air conditioners. “Air conditioner use reduces significantly if users also run their ceiling fans, as the room cools much faster,” said Abhyankar. ___ Follow Sibi Arasu on X at @sibi123 ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Search ends for those missing after Yemen's Houthi rebels sink ship in Red Sea,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/search-ends-for-those-missing-after-yemens-houthi-rebels-sink-ship-in-red-sea-2025-07-13/,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The search for those missing after Yemen's Houthi rebels sank a ship in the Red Sea has ended as at least four people are presumed dead and 11 others remain unaccounted for, the private security firms involved said Monday. The announcement came as satellite photos show long, trailing oil slicks from where the bulk carrier Eternity C sank, as well as another where the sinking of the bulk carrier Magic Seas by the Iranian-backed Houthis took place. Both ships were attacked over a week ago by the rebels as part of their campaign targeting vessels over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip that's upended shipping in the Red Sea, through which $1 trillion of goods usually passes a year. The private security firms Ambrey and Diaplous Group ran the search for those missing from the Eternity C, which had a three-man security team aboard but requested no escort from either the U.S. Navy or a European Union force in the region. The ship came under attack July 7 and faced hours of Houthi assaults by small arms and bomb-carrying drones before ultimately sinking in the Red Sea. The initial attack on the Eternity C came a day after the attack on the Magic Seas. Both ships were Liberian-flagged, Greek-owned vessels. Ten people were recovered alive from the attack, including eight Filipino crew members and a Greek and Indian from the vessel’s security team, the EU's Operation Aspides said. At least four are presumed to have been killed in the attack, leaving 11 others missing, the EU mission has said. The Houthis claimed to have taken some mariners after the attack, but have offered no evidence of that. The U.S. Embassy in Yemen said it believed the rebels had “kidnapped” some of the crew. “The decision to end the search has been taken by the vessel’s Owner reluctantly but it believes that, in all the circumstances, the priority must now be to get the 10 souls safely recovered alive ashore and to provide them with the urgent medical support they need at this difficult time,” a statement by the security firms said. “The thoughts of all those involved in the rescue operation are with the families of those who remain missing.” The attacks on the vessels also raised concerns about damage to the environment in the Red Sea, home to corals and wildlife that draws divers, tourists and scientists. Satellite photos from Planet Labs PBC analyzed Monday by The Associated Press show large, spreading oil slicks in the southern Red Sea where the vessels sank. Wim Zwijnenburg, an analyst with the Dutch peace organization PAX, estimated the length of the slick from the Eternity C at some 80 kilometers (50 miles) and from the Magic Seas at some 65 kilometers (40 miles). He warned it could threatened wildlife reserves in nearby Eritrea in Africa and elsewhere. The oil comes from the ship's tanks and had been used for their own propulsion. Other shipping disasters have seen much of the slicks evaporate on their own, though they cause damage to the environment, too. From November 2023 to December 2024, the Houthis targeted more than 100 ships with missiles and drones. In their campaign so far, the Houthis have sank four vessels and killed at least eight mariners. The Houthis stopped their attacks during a brief ceasefire in the war. They later became the target of an intense weekslong campaign of airstrikes ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump before he declared a ceasefire had been reached with the rebels. The Houthis' new attacks come as a new possible ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war remains in the balance. Meanwhile, the future of talks between the U.S. and Iran over Tehran’s battered nuclear program is in question after Israel launched a 12-day war against the Islamic Republic that saw the Americans bomb three Iranian atomic sites.

3 Catalysts Converge on Intel Ahead of a Critical Earnings Report,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/3-catalysts-converge-on-intel-ahead-of-a-critical-earnings-report/,"Recent price action in Intel Corporation NASDAQ: INTC stock has been anything but quiet. Shares have staged a multi-day price battle, bringing Intel’s stock to multi-month highs, breaking convincingly above the $23 mark and posting a three-month gain of over 19%. This ascent, however, has been marked by volatility, and the dynamic price movement is not random noise. It reflects a market grappling with a series of significant, fundamental changes within the company. While the stock's surface appears unsettled, a powerful combination of strategic discipline, product execution, and new business wins is building potential energy. This has created a coiled spring scenario, with anticipation mounting ahead of the company's pivotal second-quarter earnings report on July 24. That report could be the catalyst that validates the recent optimism and potentially triggers the stock's next major move. The first component of this building pressure is a new and tangible commitment to financial discipline. Under CEO Lip-Bu Tan, investors have been rewarded with clear, pragmatic decisions to strengthen the company's balance sheet and pave the way to profitability. The most significant of these is a strategic pivot in its manufacturing roadmap. Intel has chosen to prioritize the more cost-effective and higher-yielding 14A process for its upcoming products. This is a deliberate move designed to improve gross margins, a key metric for investors aggressively. This enables Intel to offer its most advanced 18A process to external foundry customers, such as Microsoft NASDAQ: MSFT, allowing for a dual strategy of pursuing both internal profitability and external technology leadership simultaneously. The company’s capital management strategy further demonstrates this financial prudence. Intel recently filed to sell approximately 35 million shares of its majority-owned subsidiary, Mobileye NASDAQ: MBLY. This move is expected to raise over $1 billion, providing funds for ambitious factory construction plans without taking on additional debt or diluting Intel’s shareholders. For a company that has navigated several years of negative free cash flow, these coordinated actions provide a credible and reassuring path toward a healthier financial future. The second pillar of the turnaround story is no longer theoretical; it is on store shelves. The official launch of laptops featuring Intel's new Lunar Lake Core Ultra 200V series processors provides the first major proof point of the company's revitalized design and engineering capabilities. Initial reviews from major independent tech publications have been overwhelmingly positive. They highlight two key victories that directly impact Intel's most important market. The final component building pressure is a landmark strategic win that validates Intel's high-risk, high-reward foundry ambitions. At a recent industry event in South Korea, Intel announced a major collaboration with SK Hynix, a global leader in memory manufacturing. Under the deal, SK Hynix will use Intel Foundry's advanced packaging technologies for its next-generation High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM). For investors, this partnership is of immense strategic importance. HBM is a critical component used in virtually all high-performance AI accelerators, where memory is stacked directly on the processor. By becoming a key packaging partner for a leading HBM supplier, Intel inserts itself directly into the heart of the broader AI hardware supply chain. This move demonstrates that Intel Foundry can compete and win against industry leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company NYSE: TSM (TSMC) in the critical area of advanced packaging. It provides significant external validation of the foundry's technology, de-risks the execution story, and opens a vital new revenue stream tied directly to the growth of AI. The combination of disciplined restructuring, proven product execution, and strategic foundry wins has created a powerful setup heading into Intel's earnings report. The stock has rallied in anticipation of these strategies translating into improved financial results. On July 24, investors will be listening intently for confirmation. Key items to watch will be management's commentary on initial sales of Lunar Lake-based systems, any upward revision to the company's gross margin outlook, and further details on the foundry business's customer pipeline. A strong report with confident forward guidance could be the definitive catalyst to validate the recent rally, rewarding patient investors and potentially uncoiling the spring for the next significant move higher. Before you consider Intel, you'll want to hear this.","It provides significant external validation of the foundry's technology, de-risks the execution story, and opens a vital new revenue stream tied directly to the growth of AI.",That report could be the catalyst that validates the recent optimism and potentially triggers the stock's next major move.,This move demonstrates that Intel Foundry can compete and win against industry leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company NYSE: TSM (TSMC) in the critical area of advanced packaging.,"A strong report with confident forward guidance could be the definitive catalyst to validate the recent rally, rewarding patient investors and potentially uncoiling the spring for the next significant move higher."
Conagra at Rock Bottom: 7% Yield & Turnaround Poised,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/conagra-at-rock-bottom-7-yield-and-turnaround-poised/,"Conagra NYSE: CAG shares are at rock bottom in early Q3 2025, offering an ideal entry for buy-and-hold investors. Although headwinds persist for the entire consumer staples sector, the company’s business contraction has come to an end, and repositioning efforts have positioned it to return to growth in FY2026. It will take time for the turnaround to gain traction; until then, the 7% dividend is reliably safe, offering income investors with a long-term time horizon some incentive to buy. The price action is bearish following the release, shaving 5% off the share price and setting a new long-term low. The market may continue to sell off, but oversold stochastic and divergence in the MACD suggest this market is overextending and setting up for a rebound. The dividend comes with some risk in 2025, and a cut can’t be entirely ruled out, but it is mitigated by the cash flow, balance sheet health, and outlook for organic business improvements. The payout ratio for 2026 is forecasted at 80% relative to the 2025 payout, which is high for any company but more sustainable relative to the free cash flow outlook. The free cash flow payout ratio was closer to 50% in 2025 and is not expected to increase significantly in 2026. The bigger risk is that the pace of distribution growth will slow or cease entirely. The balance sheet is rock solid, providing some flexibility for management. In 2025, operating activities enabled the company to reduce its debt and improve its leverage while investing in the business and paying dividends. Highlights at the end of FQ4 2025 include a reduced cash position offset by increased inventory, steady assets, reduced debt and total liabilities, and improved equity, which are tailwinds for the market. Conagra did not have a great quarter in Q4 F2025, with revenue declining by 4.3% reported and 3.5% organically. However, divestitures, consumption trends, and FX headwinds impacted the results, which don’t reflect the sequential improvements in the core business. The organic decline is due to a 1% reduction in price realization, compounded by a 2.5% decline in volume, which is not expected to linger much longer. The International segment led all reported declines. It declined by 13% due to M&A activity and foreign exchange headwinds, growing organically by 0.8%. The guidance is why this stock market is at or near its bottom. The reported revenue contraction expected for F2026 will be offset by flat to slightly higher organic growth and earnings sufficient to sustain balance sheet health and dividend distributions. This sets the market up to move sideways as it anticipates future business improvements, which could serve as catalysts for higher share prices. Until then, the dividend will keep many investors, including institutions, interested. Institutional activity is a critical factor; the group owns more than 80% of the stock, provides a solid support base, and has been buying on balance all year. The analysts' activity in 2025 is mixed, featuring numerous price target reductions and a few downgrades, all of which negatively impact the price action. However, the broad trends are bullish, including increased coverage, a firm Moderate Buy rating, and expectation for significant upside. The post-release stock price decline put CAG stock below the analysts' low-end range, setting it up to rebound by a low-single to high-double-digit amount, potentially 30% at the early July consensus. Assuming the company can gain traction in F2026, analysts' sentiment trends will strengthen and provide lift for the market.

Delta Air Lines Could Reach New Highs in 2025—And Here’s Why,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/delta-air-lines-could-reach-new-highs-in-2025-and-heres-why/,"Delta Air Lines NYSE: DAL is expected to reach new highs in 2025, as concerns inspired by tariffs and geopolitical tensions have proven overblown. The company’s Q2 results and guidance affirm that the strengths present in 2024 and Q1 2025 remain, providing solid cash flow and the ability to improve shareholder value this year, next, and over time. With a solid financial foundation and renewed investor confidence, Delta stock presents a compelling buy opportunity for the second half of 2025. Highlights from the Q2 report include record-setting quarterly adjusted revenue, outperformance on earnings, solid margin results, balance sheet improvement, and favorable guidance suggesting that momentum will continue through year-end. Among the most notable developments in Q2 was the company’s cash flow performance. Delta generated $2 billion in free cash flow in the first half of the year, putting it on pace to achieve its full-year target of $3 to $4 billion. Based on current trends, it is likely the company will end the year at the higher end of that range. This cash flow strength also enabled Delta to reduce its adjusted net debt significantly, bringing the year-to-date total down $1.7 billion, a 10% decrease in just two quarters, and increase its dividend substantially. The dividend increase is worth 25% to investors, bringing the annualized payout to nearly $1.00. The payout is reliable in 2025, running at roughly 10% of earnings, and is expected to continue growing at a robust pace over the next two to three years. Regarding shareholder value, Q2 business activities resulted in an improved cash position, increased current assets and total assets, reduced liabilities, and a nearly 15% increase in equity. Delta Air Lines’ Q2 was solid, with operating revenue up due to growth in all major reporting segments, led by higher-margin revenue streams. The company’s reported revenue fell slightly compared to last year but rose by a low-single-digit pace at the operating level, setting a quarterly record. High-margin premium revenue grew by 5%, outpacing the main cabin, while loyalty revenue increased by 8%, international revenue by 2%, and corporate revenue by a low single-digit amount. The margin news is also good for this transportation stock. The company experienced a slight decline in total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM), but this was offset by decreased fuel costs and improved cost performance, in line with forecasts. The net result is an operating margin of 12.6%, 13.2% adjusted, down 100 and 130 basis points YOY, respectively, but as expected and sufficient to generate ample cash flow and outperformance on the bottom line. The adjusted $2.10 is down compared to the prior year, but a nickel ahead of MarketBeat’s consensus and the strengths are expected to carry into Q3 and Q4. The guidance is the driving force for Delta Air Lines' stock price action. The company pulled guidance earlier in the year, leading analysts to reduce their estimates, but reinstated it with the Q2 release. The reaffirmed outlook is not only strong, expecting YOY growth, but is also well-above the consensus estimates and leading to significantly improved market sentiment.

The EU is delaying retaliatory tariffs on US goods in hopes of reaching a deal by Aug. 1,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/the-eu-is-delaying-retaliatory-tariffs-on-us-goods-in-hopes-of-reaching-a-deal-by-aug-1-2025-07-13/,"PARIS (AP) — The European Union will suspend retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods scheduled to take effect Monday in hopes of reaching a trade deal with the Trump administration by the end of the month. ″This is now the time for negotiations,″ European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters in Brussels on Sunday, after President Donald Trump sent a letter announcing new tariffs of 30% on goods from the EU and Mexico starting Aug. 1. The EU — America’s biggest trading partner and the world’s largest trading bloc — had been scheduled to impose ″countermeasures″ starting Monday at midnight Brussels time (6 p.m. EDT; 22:00 GMT). The EU negotiates trade deals on behalf of its 27 member countries. Von der Leyen said those countermeasures would be delayed until Aug. 1, and that Trump's letter shows ″that we have until the first of August″ to negotiate. Europe’s biggest exports to the U.S. are pharmaceuticals, cars, aircraft, chemicals, medical instruments and wine and spirits. ″We have always been clear that we prefer a negotiated solution,″ she said. If they can’t reach a deal, she said that ″we will continue to prepare countermeasures so we are fully prepared.″ Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni warned Sunday that a trade war “would make us all weaker in the face of the global challenges we face together” and said Italy would actively work for a fair deal. “Europe has the economic and financial strength to make the case for a fair and common-sense agreement,” her office said in a statement. Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani was heading to Washington for talks Monday with the U.S. administration and Congress. The right-wing government of Meloni, the only EU leader to attend Trump’s inauguration, has sought to position itself as a “ bridge” between Brussels and Washington. Trump has said his global tariffs would set the foundation for reviving a U.S. economy that he claims has been ripped off by other nations for decades. Trump in his letter to the EU said the U.S. trade deficit was a national security threat. Trump isn't satisfied with some of the draft agreements on trade, White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said on ABC News Sunday. “The bottom line is that he’s seen some sketches of deals that had been negotiated with Howard Lutnick and the rest of the trade team, and the president thinks that the deals need to be better, and to basically put a line in the sand, he sent these letters out to folks. And we’ll see how it works out,"" he said. U.S. trade partners — and companies around the world including French winemakers to German carmakers — have faced months of uncertainty and on-and-off threats from Trump to impose tariffs, with deadlines sometimes extended or changed. The tariffs could have ramifications for nearly every aspect of the global economy. The value of EU-U.S. trade in goods and services amounted to 1.7 trillion euros ($2 trillion) in 2024, or an average of 4.6 billion euros a day, according to EU statistics agency Eurostat. Trade ministers from EU countries are scheduled to meet Monday to discuss trade relations with the U.S., as well as with China. The EU is weighing closer ties with China as a result of Trump's threatened tariffs. Speaking alongside Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto, von der Leyen said the trade tensions with the U.S. show the importance of ’’diversifying our trade relationships.″ Announcing closer cooperation between the EU and Indonesia, she stressed the need for ‘’predictable'' trading partnerships based on ‘’trust.'' The Indonesian leader said, ‘’I think the United States will be always a very important leader in the world,'' but stressed the need for multilateral relationships, adding, ‘’We would like to see a very strong Europe.'' ___ Associated Press writer Nicole Winfield in Rome contributed to this report.","″This is now the time for negotiations,″ European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters in Brussels on Sunday, after President Donald Trump sent a letter announcing new tariffs of 30% on goods from the EU and Mexico starting Aug. 1.","“The bottom line is that he’s seen some sketches of deals that had been negotiated with Howard Lutnick and the rest of the trade team, and the president thinks that the deals need to be better, and to basically put a line in the sand, he sent these letters out to folks.",Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani was heading to Washington for talks Monday with the U.S. administration and Congress.,"“The bottom line is that he’s seen some sketches of deals that had been negotiated with Howard Lutnick and the rest of the trade team, and the president thinks that the deals need to be better, and to basically put a line in the sand, he sent these letters out to folks."
"From tariffs to universities, Trump’s negotiating style is often less dealmaking and more coercion",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/from-tariffs-to-universities-trumps-negotiating-style-is-often-less-dealmaking-and-more-coercion-2025-07-13/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump prides himself on being a dealmaker, but his negotiating style is more ultimatum than compromise. In the last week, Trump has slapped trading partners with tariffs rather than slog through prolonged talks to reach agreements. He ratcheted up the pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. And his administration launched a new investigation into higher education as he tries to reshape universities. For Trump, a deal isn’t necessarily agreement in which two sides compromise — it’s an opportunity to bend others to his will. While Trump occasionally backs down from his threats, the past week is a reminder that they are a permanent feature of his presidency. As Trump tightens his grip on independent institutions, there are fewer checks on his power. Republicans in Congress fear primary challenges backed by the president, and the Supreme Court is stocked with appointees from his first term. Trump recently summed up his approach when talking to reporters about trade talks with other countries. “They don’t set the deal,"" he said. ""I set the deal.” Trump’s allies believe his aggression is required in a political ecosystem where he's under siege from Democrats, the court system and the media. In their view, the president is simply trying to fulfill the agenda that he was elected to achieve. But critics fear he's eroding the country’s democratic foundations with an authoritarian style. They say the president's focus on negotiations is a facade for attempts to dominate his opponents and expand his power. “Pluralism and a diversity of institutions operating with autonomy — companies, the judiciary, nonprofit institutions that are important elements of society — are much of what defines real democracy,” said Larry Summers, a former Treasury secretary and former president of Harvard University. “That is threatened by heavy handed, extortionist approaches.” Harvard has been a top target for Trump, starting in April when he demanded changes to the university's governance and new faculty members to counteract liberal bias. As Harvard resisted, administration officials terminated $2.2 billion in federal grants. The money is the lifeblood of the university's sprawling research operation, which includes studies on cancer, Parkinson's disease, space travel and pandemic preparedness. Trump has also attempted to block Harvard from hosting roughly 7,000 foreign students, and he's threatened to revoke its tax-exempt status. His administration recently sent subpoenas asking for student data. “They’ll absolutely reach a deal,"" Trump said Wednesday. Administration officials also pulled $175 million from the University of Pennsylvania in March over a dispute around women's sports. They restored it when school officials agreed to update records set by transgender swimmer Lia Thomas and change their policies. Columbia University bent to Trump by putting its Middle East studies department under new supervision, among other changes, after the administration pulled $400 million in federal funding. At the University of Virginia, President James Ryan resigned under pressure following a Justice Department investigation into diversity, equity and inclusion practices. A similar investigation was opened Thursday at George Mason University. “Federal funding is a privilege, not a right, for colleges and universities,"" said Kush Desai, a White House spokesman. Such steps were unheard of before Trump took office. Ted Mitchell, president of the American Council on Education and an Education Department official under President Barack Obama, said Trump isn't seeking deals but is “demanding more and more and more.” ""Institutional autonomy is an important part of what makes higher education work,"" he said. “It’s what enables universities to pursue the truth without political considerations.” The Fed has also faced Trump's wrath. He blames Fed Chair Jerome Powell for moving too slowly to cut interest rates, which could make consumer debt like mortgages and auto loans more affordable. It could also help the U.S. government finance the federal debt that's expected to climb from the tax cuts that Trump recently signed into law. Powell has held off on cutting the central bank's benchmark rate, as Trump's tariffs could possibly worsen inflation and lower rates could intensify that problem. Desai said the White House believes the Fed should act based on what the data currently shows, which is that ""President Trump’s policies have swiftly tamed inflation.” Although Trump has said he won't try to fire Powell — a step that might be impossible under the law anyway — he's called on him to resign. In addition, Trump's allies have increased their scrutiny of Powell's management, particularly an expensive renovation of the central bank's headquarters. David Wessel, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, said Trump's approach could undermine the Fed's credibility by casting a political shadow over its decisions. “There will be real costs if markets and global investors think the Fed has been beaten into submission by Trump,"" he said. Trump originally wanted to enact sweeping tariffs in April. In his view, import taxes would fix the challenge of the U.S. buying too much from other countries and not selling enough overseas. After a backlash in financial markets, Trump instituted a three-month negotiating period on tariffs. Peter Navarro, one of his advisers, said the goal was “90 deals in 90 days.” The administration announced a few trade frameworks with the United Kingdom and Vietnam, but Trump ran out of patience. He's sent letters to two dozen nations and the European Union informing them of their tariff rates, such as 30% against the EU and Mexico, potentially undercutting the work of his own negotiators. Desai said Trump's approach has generated “overwhelming interest” from other countries in reaching trade deals and gives the U.S. leverage in negotiations. John C. Brown, a professor emeritus of economics at Clark University in Massachusetts, said the “willy-nilly setting of tariffs according to one person’s whims has no precedence in the history of trade policy since the 17th century.” “It’s just bizarre,” Brown said of Trump’s moves. “No one has done this in history.” The president has also used the threat of tariffs in an attempt to help political allies and influence other countries' court systems. He told Brazil that he would implement a 50% tariff if the country didn't drop its prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro, who like Trump was charged with trying to overturn an election. Inu Manak, a fellow on trade policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, said Trump's inconsistent approach will foster distrust of U.S. motives. She noted that two of the letters went to Canada and South Korea, allies who have existing trade agreements with the U.S. approved by Congress. By imposing new tariffs, she said, Trump is raising “serious questions about the meaning of signing any deal with the United States at all.”",Trump recently summed up his approach when talking to reporters about trade talks with other countries.,"Ted Mitchell, president of the American Council on Education and an Education Department official under President Barack Obama, said Trump isn't seeking deals but is “demanding more and more and more.” ""Institutional autonomy is an important part of what makes higher education work,"" he said.","He blames Fed Chair Jerome Powell for moving too slowly to cut interest rates, which could make consumer debt like mortgages and auto loans more affordable.","Desai said the White House believes the Fed should act based on what the data currently shows, which is that ""President Trump’s policies have swiftly tamed inflation.” Although Trump has said he won't try to fire Powell — a step that might be impossible under the law anyway — he's called on him to resign."
Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese visits China to strengthen trade relations,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/australia-pm-albanese-kicks-off-china-visit-focused-on-trade-2025-07-13/,"BEIJING (AP) — Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese kicked off a visit this weekend to China meant to shore up trade relations between the two countries. Albanese met with Shanghai Party Secretary Chen Jining on Sunday, the first in a series of high-level exchanges that will include meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Premier Li Qiang and Chairman Zhao Leji of the National People’s Congress. The prime minister is leading “a very large business delegation” to China, which speaks to the importance of the economic relations between Australia and China, he told Chinese state broadcaster CGTN upon his arrival in Shanghai on Saturday. During a weeklong trip, Albanese was set to meet business, tourism and sport representatives in Shanghai and Chengdu, including a CEO roundtable on Tuesday in Beijing, his office said. He oversaw the signing of an agreement between Chinese online travel giant Trip.com and the government agency Tourism Australia aimed at attracting more Chinese tourists to the continent. It is Albanese’s second visit to China since his center-left Labor Party government was first elected in 2022. The party was reelected in May with an increased majority. Albanese has managed to persuade Beijing to remove a series of official and unofficial trade barriers introduced under the previous conservative government that cost Australian exporters more than 20 billion Australian dollars ($13 billion) a year. Beijing severed communications with the previous administration over issues including Australia's calls for an independent inquiry into the origins of and responses to COVID-19. But Albanese wants to reduce Australia’s economic dependence on China, a free trade partner. ""My government very much values our relationship with China,"" Albanese said during his meeting with Chen. “We deal with each other in a calm and consistent manner, and we want to continue to pursue our national interests, and it is in our interest to have good relations with China.” Chinese state-run Xinhua News Agency, in an editorial Saturday, described China’s relationship with Australia as “steadily improving” and undergoing “fresh momentum.” “There are no fundamental conflicts of interest between China and Australia,” the editorial stated. “By managing differences through mutual respect and focusing on shared interests, the two sides can achieve common prosperity and benefit.”","The prime minister is leading “a very large business delegation” to China, which speaks to the importance of the economic relations between Australia and China, he told Chinese state broadcaster CGTN upon his arrival in Shanghai on Saturday.","“We deal with each other in a calm and consistent manner, and we want to continue to pursue our national interests, and it is in our interest to have good relations with China.” Chinese state-run Xinhua News Agency, in an editorial Saturday, described China’s relationship with Australia as “steadily improving” and undergoing “fresh momentum.” “There are no fundamental conflicts of interest between China and Australia,” the editorial stated.",It is Albanese’s second visit to China since his center-left Labor Party government was first elected in 2022.,"“We deal with each other in a calm and consistent manner, and we want to continue to pursue our national interests, and it is in our interest to have good relations with China.” Chinese state-run Xinhua News Agency, in an editorial Saturday, described China’s relationship with Australia as “steadily improving” and undergoing “fresh momentum.” “There are no fundamental conflicts of interest between China and Australia,” the editorial stated."
New tax break for auto loans could save some buyers thousands of dollars. But will it boost sales?,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/new-tax-break-for-auto-loans-could-save-some-buyers-thousands-of-dollars-but-will-it-boost-sales-2025-07-12/,"Millions of people receive a federal tax deduction for the interest they pay on home loans. Under President Donald Trump’s new tax-cut law, many people for the first time also could claim a tax deduction for interest on their vehicle loans. The new tax break will be available even to people who don't itemize deductions. But there are some caveats that could limit its reach. The vehicles must be new, not used. They must be assembled in the U.S. And the loans must be issued no sooner than this year, to list just a few qualifications. Here are some things to know about the new auto loan interest tax deduction: Trump pledged while campaigning last year to make interest on car loans tax-deductible. He said it would make car ownership more affordable and “stimulate massive domestic auto production.” The idea made it into the big tax-cut bill passed by Congress, which Trump signed into law July 4. The law allows taxpayers to deduct up to $10,000 of interest payments annually on loans for new American-made vehicles from 2025 through 2028. It applies to cars, motorcycles, sport utility vehicles, minivans, vans and pickup trucks weighing less than 14,000 pounds, a threshold referred to as light vehicles. But it only applies to vehicles purchased for personal use, not for fleets or commercial purposes. The tax break can be claimed starting on 2025 income tax returns. But the deduction phases out for individuals with incomes between $100,000 and $150,000 or joint taxpayers with incomes between $200,000 and $250,000. Those earning more cannot claim the tax break. U.S. automobile dealers sold 15.9 million new light vehicles last year, a little over half of which were assembled in the U.S, according to Cox Automotive. It says around 60% of retail sales are financed with loans. After excluding fleet and commercial vehicles and customers above the income cutoff, an estimated 3.5 million new vehicle loans could be eligible for the tax break this year, if purchasing patterns stay the same, said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive. The tax break applies to vehicles assembled in the U.S., no matter where the company making them is headquartered. All Tesla vehicles sold in the U.S. are assembled in this country. But so are all Acura brands, the luxury model of Japanese automaker Honda. Last year, 78% of Ford vehicles sold in the U.S. were assembled in this country, according to Cox Automotive. But customers wanting the tax break will need to pay attention to specific models. While the Ford Mustang is assembled in Michigan, the Mustang Mach-E is built in Mexico. General Motors assembles all of its Cadillacs in the U.S. But just 44% of its Chevrolets sold last year were assembled in the U.S., and just 14% of Buicks, according to Cox Automotive. That's a lower U.S-assembled rate than Honda (60%), Toyota (52%) and Nissan (48%), which all are headquartered in Japan. The average new vehicle loan is about $44,000 financed over six years. Interest rates vary by customer, so the savings will, too. In general, the tax deduction will decline after the initial year, because interest payments on loans are frontloaded while principal payments grow on the back end. At a 9.3% interest rate, an average new vehicle buyer could save about $2,200 on taxes over four years, Smoke said. The tax savings would be less on a loan at 6.5%, which is the rate figured into calculations by the American Financial Services Association, a consumer credit industry trade group. Whereas the tax deduction for home loan interest can be claimed only by people itemizing on their tax returns, Congress wrote the deduction for auto loan interest so that it can apply to all taxpayers, including those claiming the standard deduction. On a tax form, the auto loan deduction will come before the calculation of a taxpayer's adjusted gross income. That's an important distinction, because many states use a taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income as the starting point for figuring their state income taxes. If that income figure is lower, it could reduce the state taxes owed. At Bowen Scarff Ford in Kent, Washington, customers started asking about the auto loan tax deduction before Congress had even taken a final vote on the tax-cut bill, said General Manager Paul Ray. So he decided to promote it on the dealer's website. A website ribbon exclaims: “CAR LOAN TAX DEDUCTION NOW AVAILABLE"" while also promoting an electric vehicle tax credit that is ending soon as a result of Trump's tax-cut law. “I think it’s going to help incentivize vehicle purchases through this year,"" Ray said. Celia Winslow, president and CEO of the American Financial Services Association, concurred: “For some people deciding — should I buy it, should I not — this could be something that tips the scale.” Others remain skeptical. According to Smoke's math, the average annual tax savings is smaller than a single month's loan payment for a new vehicle. “I don’t think it moves the needle on somebody on the fence of buying a new vehicle or not,"" Smoke said. ""But I think it could influence their decision to finance that vehicle instead of paying cash or instead of leasing a vehicle.” Before you consider General Motors, you'll want to hear this.","Whereas the tax deduction for home loan interest can be claimed only by people itemizing on their tax returns, Congress wrote the deduction for auto loan interest so that it can apply to all taxpayers, including those claiming the standard deduction.","Whereas the tax deduction for home loan interest can be claimed only by people itemizing on their tax returns, Congress wrote the deduction for auto loan interest so that it can apply to all taxpayers, including those claiming the standard deduction.","U.S. automobile dealers sold 15.9 million new light vehicles last year, a little over half of which were assembled in the U.S, according to Cox Automotive.","Whereas the tax deduction for home loan interest can be claimed only by people itemizing on their tax returns, Congress wrote the deduction for auto loan interest so that it can apply to all taxpayers, including those claiming the standard deduction."
Leaders of Azerbaijan and Syria discuss energy cooperation as they rebuild ties,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/azerbaijan-and-syria-discuss-energy-cooperation-as-they-rebuild-ties-2025-07-12/,"The leaders of Azerbaijan and Syria on Saturday pledged to deepen their cooperation particularly in the energy sector, as they moved to revitalize the ties that had been strained under former Syrian President Bashar Assad. Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev expressed hope that the visit to Baku by Syria's interim Ahmad Al-Sharaa, whose rebel forces toppled Assad in December, would “significantly contribute to the development of bilateral relations.” Al-Sharaa thanked Aliyev for Azerbaijan’s “brotherly support to Syria” and said that Assad's government had harmed relations with many countries, including Azerbaijan, according to the Azerbaijan president's press service. The leaders also highlighted plans to to export Azerbaijani gas to Syria via Turkey and Azerbaijan’s potential role in rebuilding Syria’s energy infrastructure, it said. The new authorities in Damascus have strong relations with Turkey, Azerbaijan’s close ally. Baku — which also has close relations with Israel — has in recent months served as an intermediary to diffuse growing tensions between Turkey and Israel in the Syrian arena. In April, Turkey and Israel held “technical talks” in Azerbaijan to establish a “de-escalation mechanism to prevent undesirable incidents in Syria.”","The leaders of Azerbaijan and Syria on Saturday pledged to deepen their cooperation particularly in the energy sector, as they moved to revitalize the ties that had been strained under former Syrian President Bashar Assad.","Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev expressed hope that the visit to Baku by Syria's interim Ahmad Al-Sharaa, whose rebel forces toppled Assad in December, would “significantly contribute to the development of bilateral relations.” Al-Sharaa thanked Aliyev for Azerbaijan’s “brotherly support to Syria” and said that Assad's government had harmed relations with many countries, including Azerbaijan, according to the Azerbaijan president's press service.","The new authorities in Damascus have strong relations with Turkey, Azerbaijan’s close ally.","Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev expressed hope that the visit to Baku by Syria's interim Ahmad Al-Sharaa, whose rebel forces toppled Assad in December, would “significantly contribute to the development of bilateral relations.” Al-Sharaa thanked Aliyev for Azerbaijan’s “brotherly support to Syria” and said that Assad's government had harmed relations with many countries, including Azerbaijan, according to the Azerbaijan president's press service."
Power Solutions International Poised for 75% Upside,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/power-solutions-international-poised-for-75-upside/,"If you have wondered whether Power Solutions International’s NASDAQ: PSIX stock rally is played out or has room to run, the charts say this market is strengthening and has room to run. A lot of room to run. The company's weekly chart is a textbook example of a bull market gaining strength. It shows the potential to rise by another 75% before reaching a significant top. Bullish signals include the price action, which is trending strongly higher, the MACD, which is robust and converging with the highs, and volume, which is also strong, rising, and converging with the highs. Together, they amount to a strong technical signal; the only problem is that the price is pulling back in mid-July. However, some interesting possibilities emerge, assuming the market is entering a consolidation, potentially forming a triangle or flag pattern. The market will create a continuation pattern in that scenario and bring the full magnitude of its move into view. A bullish flag pattern is typically the middle or within the mid-range of a larger movement, which, in this case, could extend by an amount equal to the rally that preceded it. That’s a solid $60 movement, potentially putting this market at $140 by the end of this year. Power Solutions International is an outside-the-box AI play whose business is essential to the industry: power and power management. Its custom engines and power solutions are used for critical backup power supply, seamlessly integrated into the data center infrastructure. That is a vital element in an industry reliant on steady, reliable power, and PSIX doesn’t stop there. Power Solutions International also provides power management equipment and services, essential for the power-consuming data center industry. Other business drivers include its impact on end-user compliance requirements, such as environmental. PSIX solutions can be used with multiple fuel types, including natural gas, propane, and biofuel. It is also a diversified business model with operations spanning industrial, transportation, and power system markets. The critical takeaway is that Power Solutions International’s revenue growth accelerated under the influence of AI. The Q1 results revealed a 42.3% year-over-year (YOY) increase, which outperformed MarketBeat’s consensus by 2500 basis points and led management to provide strong guidance. The consensus is for revenue growth to continue sequentially, sustaining a high-double-digit YOY pace through the end of the year, and is likely too cautious. The consensus is expected to be low due to the low number of analysts covering the stock and the amount of revision activity in 2025. The analysts and institutional activity is tepid in 2025 but offers potential for increased activity. MarketBeat tracks a single analyst and reports less than 25% institutional ownership. The single analyst rates the stock as a Buy, with more Buy ratings expected. Institutions have been buying on balance in 2025, a trend likely to strengthen over the coming quarters. Unlike many small-cap tech stocks, this one makes money today. The company’s margins are not only positive in 2025 but are also widening under the influence of revenue leverage, operational improvement, and spending controls. Gross margin widened by 270 basis points in Q1, while SG&A grew much slower than revenue, resulting in net income increasing by nearly 170% and adjusted EPS just over eight cents, 37 cents higher than expected. Cash flow is also positive, allowing PSIX to reduce debt in Q1. The company’s cash position is also solid, leaving equity up roughly 30% and the business in a flexible financial position. Management aims to leverage the balance sheet, using debt to fund growth and drive value gains for shareholders.

Why Wall Street Is Betting on These 3 Comeback Stocks,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/why-wall-street-is-betting-on-these-3-comeback-stocks/,"The first half of 2025 was a tumultuous time for U.S. securities, to put it mildly. The transition to the second Trump administration brought rapidly shifting domestic and international policies and ever-changing tariffs to an economy that some analysts feel is on the brink of recession. Still, after a precipitous drop in early April, the S&P 500 recovered nicely in the second quarter. With gains of more than 6% for the first half of the year, the benchmark index is starting the third quarter at fresh record highs. That's not to say, however, that every security in the U.S. market has been successful at staging a recovery. Some prominent firms have significantly underperformed the broader market in the first half of 2025. Despite their recent troubles, however, three of these companies may present investors an opportunity to buy before share prices recover, capturing attractive returns in the process. Health insurance and services giant UnitedHealth Group Inc. NYSE: UNH had a dismal start to the year, with shares plummeting after top- and bottom-line misses on its first earnings report of 2025 and then falling further through May. Though still the top U.S. insurer by market value, UnitedHealth has shed more than 40% of its share price this year. The company's issues are many and varied: surging medical costs threaten its earnings performance, the departure of its CEO has disrupted stability, and an ongoing fraud investigation has done sizable reputational damage. Analysts forecast a year-over-year (YOY) dip of more than 20% for EPS in the company's second-quarter earnings report, although revenue may increase over the same period. All that being said, investors may also have reasons to expect a turnaround from one of Congress' favorite stocks to buy in recent weeks. UNH did recently boost its dividend and sell off a portion of its Latin American unit, Banmedica, both of which should appeal to shareholders hoping the company will provide a stronger value proposition. Further, the company's fundamental business model—diversified between healthcare services and insurance—has long been a winner. If UNH can find a catalyst to reintegrate stability, it could stage a turnaround and see 38% upside potential. Meanwhile, with a P/S ratio of just 0.7 and a trailing P/E ratio of 12.9, shares are valued as competitively as they've been in a long time. Southern California utility firm Edison International NYSE: EIX experienced notable volatility in the first half of the year, with a number of rises and falls in the first six months amid wildfires across the region. Entering the third quarter, though, shares are down more than 22%. Like other California utilities, Edison is facing the possibility of massive regulatory overhaul statewide thanks to SB 254. The bill would limit Edison's ability to raise prices and also stipulate that it, alongside other utility firms, would pay for fire mitigation and other additional costs. The risk of regulatory uncertainty is significant, particularly for Edison's short-term performance. Still, nine out of 15 analysts believe EIX shares are a Buy, and analysts are widely optimistic about the company's ability to boost its earnings by nearly 17% in the next year. The firm also has a strong dividend yield of 6.60%. Investors willing to wait out shifting regulations—or who suspect SB 254 may not be passed in its current form—might consider taking a chance on EIX while the P/S ratio is just 1.1. Customer relationship management (CRM) software leader Salesforce Inc. NYSE: CRM saw shares dwindle in price in the first months of the year, and they have so far not made a recovery. The share price has declined by 14% in the first half. Salesforce has successfully transitioned toward a model that prioritizes profitability, and its margins are improving. The company is drawing new business with its agentic AI offerings like Agentforce, even as its core products continue to sustain users from year to year. Quarterly data cloud and AI revenue recently more than doubled YOY.

"Trump announces 30% tariffs against EU, Mexico to begin Aug. 1, rattling major US trading partners",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-announces-30-tariffs-against-eu-mexico-to-begin-august-1-2025-07-12/,"BRIDGEWATER, N.J. (AP) — President Donald Trump on Saturday announced he's levying tariffs of 30% against the European Union and Mexico starting Aug. 1, a move that could cause massive upheaval between the United States and two of its biggest trade partners. Trump detailed the planned tariffs in letters posted to his social media account. They are part of an announcement blitz by Trump of new tariffs aimed at allies and foes alike, a bedrock of his 2024 campaign that he said would set the foundation for reviving a U.S. economy that he claims has been ripped off by other nations for decades. In his letter to Mexico's leader, President Claudia Sheinbaum, Trump acknowledged that the country has been helpful in stemming the flow of undocumented migrants and fentanyl into the United States. But he said the country has not done enough to stop North America from turning into a “Narco-Trafficking Playground.” “Mexico has been helping me secure the border, BUT, what Mexico has done, is not enough,” Trump added. Trump in his letter to the European Union said the U.S. trade deficit was a national security threat. “We have had years to discuss our Trading Relationship with The European Union, and we have concluded we must move away from these long-term, large, and persistent, Trade Deficits, engendered by your Tariff, and Non-Tariff, Policies, and Trade Barriers,” Trump wrote in the letter to the EU. “Our relationship has been, unfortunately, far from Reciprocal.” The letters come in the midst of an on-and-off Trump threat to impose tariffs on countries and right an imbalance in trade. Trump in April imposed tariffs on dozens of countries, before pausing them for 90 days to negotiate individual deals. As the three-month grace period ended this week, Trump began sending his tariff letters to leaders but again has pushed back the implementation day for what he says will be just a few more weeks. If he moves forward with the tariffs, it could have ramifications for nearly every aspect of the global economy. European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen responded by noting the bloc's “commitment to dialogue, stability, and a constructive transatlantic partnership.” “At the same time, we will take all necessary steps to safeguard EU interests, including the adoption of proportionate countermeasures if required,” von der Leyen said in a statement. Von der Leyen added that the EU remains committed to continuing negotiations with the U.S. and coming to an agreement before Aug. 1. Trade ministers from EU countries are scheduled to meet Monday to discuss trade relations with the U.S., as well as with China. European leaders joined von der Leyen in urging Trump to give negotiations more time and warnings of possible new tariffs on Washington. “With European unity, it is more than ever up to the Commission to assert the Union’s determination to resolutely defend European interests,” French President Emmanuel Macron said in a statement posted on X. Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni’s office said ""it would make no sense to trigger a trade war between the two sides of the Atlantic."" Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen told broadcaster DR that Trump was taking a “pointless and a very shortsighted approach."" Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson warned in an interview with SVT that “everyone loses out from an escalated trade conflict, and it will be U.S. consumers who pay the highest price.” Trump, as he has in previous letters, warned that his administration would further raise tariffs if the EU attempts to hike its own tariffs on the United States. The Mexican government said it was informed during high-level talks with U.S. State Department officials Friday that the Trump letter was coming. The delegation told Trump officials at the meeting it disagreed with the decision and considered it “unfair treatment,” according to a Mexican government statement. Sheinbaum, who has sought to avoid directly criticizing Trump in the early going of her presidency, expressed a measure of confidence during a public appearance on Saturday that the U.S. and Mexico will reach “better terms.” “I’ve always said that in these cases, you need a cool head to face any problem,” Sheinbaum said. With the reciprocal tariffs, Trump is effectively blowing up the rules governing world trade. For decades, the United States and most other countries abided by tariff rates set through a series of complex negotiations known as the Uruguay round. Countries could set their own tariffs, but under the “most favored nation’’ approach, they couldn’t charge one country more than they charged another. The Mexico tariff, if it goes into effect, could replace the 25% tariffs on Mexican goods that do not comply with the existing U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement. Trump’s letter did not address if USMCA-compliant goods would still be exempt from the Mexico tariffs after Aug. 1, as the White House said would be the case with Canada. Trump sent a letter to Canada earlier this week threatening a 35% tariff hike. With Saturday's letters, Trump has now issued tariff conditions on 24 countries and the 27-member European Union. So far, the tally of trade deals struck by Trump stands at two — one with the United Kingdom and one with Vietnam. Trump has also announced the framework for a deal with China, the details of which remain fuzzy. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Saturday said the U.K. “smartly” acted early. “Let this be a lesson to other countries - earnest, good faith negotiations can produce powerful results that benefit both sides of the table, while correcting the imbalances that plague global trade,” Bessent said in a posting on X. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former Congressional Budget Office director and president of the center-right American Action Forum, said the letters were evidence that serious trade talks were not taking place over the past three months. He stressed that nations were instead talking amongst themselves about how to minimize their own exposure to the U.S. economy and Trump. “They’re spending time talking to each other about what the future is going to look like, and we’re left out,” Holtz-Eakin said. If the tariffs do indeed take effect, the potential impact on Europe could be vast. The value of EU-U.S. trade in goods and services amounted to 1.7 trillion euros ($2 trillion) in 2024, or an average of 4.6 billion euros a day, according to EU statistics agency Eurostat. Europe’s biggest exports to the U.S. were pharmaceuticals, cars, aircraft, chemicals, medical instruments and wine and spirits. Lamberto Frescobaldi, president of the Union of Italian Wines trade association, said Trump's move could lead to “a virtual embargo” of his country's wine. “A single letter was enough to write the darkest chapter in relations between two historic Western allies,” Frescobaldi said. Trump has complained about the EU’s 198 billion-euro trade surplus in goods, which shows Americans buy more goods from European businesses than the other way around. However, American companies fill some of the gap by outselling the EU when it comes to services such as cloud computing, travel bookings, and legal and financial services. The U.S. services surplus took the nation’s trade deficit with the EU down to 50 billion euros ($59 billion), which represents less than 3% of overall U.S.-EU trade. ___ Associated Press writers Josh Boak in Washington, Angela Charlton in Paris, Regina Garcia Cano in Caracas, Venezuela, Kirsten Grieshaber in Berlin, Dave McHugh in Frankfurt, Germany, and Giada Zampano in Rome contributed to this report.",Trump in his letter to the European Union said the U.S. trade deficit was a national security threat.,"Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson warned in an interview with SVT that “everyone loses out from an escalated trade conflict, and it will be U.S. consumers who pay the highest price.” Trump, as he has in previous letters, warned that his administration would further raise tariffs if the EU attempts to hike its own tariffs on the United States.",European leaders joined von der Leyen in urging Trump to give negotiations more time and warnings of possible new tariffs on Washington.,"“Let this be a lesson to other countries - earnest, good faith negotiations can produce powerful results that benefit both sides of the table, while correcting the imbalances that plague global trade,” Bessent said in a posting on X.

Smart Investors Are Watching These 3 Undervalued Stocks,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/smart-investors-are-watching-these-3-undervalued-stocks/,"Value stocks have been the most overlooked area of the stock market in today’s cycle, replaced by the popular growth stories that have captured investor attention (and capital) over the past year or so. However, a few key factors in market fundamentals may trigger a rotation back into value, or specifically undervalued stocks, over the coming months and quarters. With this in mind, investors can run a screening process to land their portfolios on the right side of the market, a screener that looks for high returns on capital (for future compounding benefits) and strong business models that can sustain economic cycles better than others. Finding this criterion, all investors need is a reasonable discount, whether in terms of price action or valuation multiples, to deliver the sort of upside everyone is looking for. Fitting this filtering process, names like Ulta Beauty Inc. NASDAQ: ULTA, Adobe Inc. NASDAQ: ADBE, and even Sprouts Farmers Market Inc. NASDAQ: SFM return the best profile. Not only are these names positioned in a low-cyclical space within their industry, which is reflected in their high profit metrics, but they also trade at valuations that create an asymmetric upside opportunity for investors today. Even though Ulta stock now trades near its 52-week high, other traditional valuation methods indicate how cheap this stock is today. Looking at the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for Ulta, which is currently 19.7x, investors can notice a significant discrepancy compared to historical levels. Ulta, as a business, hasn’t been this undervalued since the onset of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, despite today’s world being significantly different and better than it was back then. There are no lockdowns keeping customers from buying skincare and makeup products, and the company’s fundamentals have done nothing but keep pushing on. As one of the largest players in the consumer discretionary space, Ulta commands favorable pricing power dynamics, enabling its gross profit margins to reach as high as 42.7%. High margins are the building blocks of profitable businesses, the ones that compound investor capital year after year. One metric that can solidify this theme is the return on invested capital (ROIC) rate for Ulta’s business, which came in at an impressive 26.8% over the past 12 months. ROIC matters because, eventually, annual stock price performance tends to align with the long-term ROIC rate, and for Ulta, this has consistently been between 24% and 27%. This setup might explain why Michael Baker, an analyst at DA Davidson, decided to reiterate his Buy rating on Ulta stock. This time, he also placed a $550 per share price target on the company to call for an additional 16% upside from today’s price. Given where the forward P/E is today, chances are Ulta might not only meet but exceed this valuation target. Following in the same theme as Ulta, Adobe’s forward P/E of 17.1x is now the lowest it has been on record, and that simply cannot sit well with logical investors who understand that today’s economic landscape is nowhere near where it could be to justify such a low price on a company like Adobe. What makes Adobe great is that most of its revenue comes from subscription services, which provide a steady and predictable stream of cash flows. This allows management and analysts to manage and forecast financials accurately into the future; it also inherently reduces the volatility that investors might see in the stock price. Now that Adobe's price has fallen to only 64% of its 52-week high, the asymmetric nature of the company’s potential upside stands out, as it should. This will allow investors to enjoy a relatively smooth ride higher in the coming months and quarters. With this setup in mind, it shouldn’t be a surprise to see sentiment change for Adobe soon enough. In fact, Gil Luria from DA Davidson has placed a Buy rating on Adobe as of late June 2025, alongside a price target of up to $500 per share, which would command an upside potential of 34% from today’s price. Adobe’s ability to generate an ROIC of up to 36% should be enough to keep the stock compounding higher into the future. Although this stock has already delivered a massive rally of up to 100% over the past 12 months, it still has considerable potential to continue pushing higher. The reason for the additional upside lies in the company’s business itself, as part of the defensive and non-cyclical space that might become more attractive during a broader rotation into value. Sprouts Farmers Market sports a 15% ROIC, which puts it at the top of the peer group in terms of profitability, so the discounted multiples don’t, and shouldn’t, apply in this case. While the other names on this list operate in a space that could be a breeding ground for competition or diminishing returns, Sprouts has one of the oldest business models in place. Supermarket chains differ from technology stocks or retail because those that can lead in profitability tend to remain leaders for a long period. This is why this stock commands a premium valuation of 30.8x forward P/E over the rest of the peer group and even the S&P 500 index. It's all for good reason, and its recent price action justifies that view. Before you consider Ulta Beauty, you'll want to hear this.","Now that Adobe's price has fallen to only 64% of its 52-week high, the asymmetric nature of the company’s potential upside stands out, as it should.","Following in the same theme as Ulta, Adobe’s forward P/E of 17.1x is now the lowest it has been on record, and that simply cannot sit well with logical investors who understand that today’s economic landscape is nowhere near where it could be to justify such a low price on a company like Adobe.","Following in the same theme as Ulta, Adobe’s forward P/E of 17.1x is now the lowest it has been on record, and that simply cannot sit well with logical investors who understand that today’s economic landscape is nowhere near where it could be to justify such a low price on a company like Adobe.","Following in the same theme as Ulta, Adobe’s forward P/E of 17.1x is now the lowest it has been on record, and that simply cannot sit well with logical investors who understand that today’s economic landscape is nowhere near where it could be to justify such a low price on a company like Adobe."
"Osprey came back from the brink once. Now chicks are dying in nests, and some blame overfishing",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/osprey-came-back-from-the-brink-once-now-chicks-are-dying-in-nests-and-some-blame-overfishing-2025-07-12/,"GLOUCESTER POINT, Va. (AP) — Stepping onto an old wooden duck blind in the middle of the York River, Bryan Watts looks down at a circle of sticks and pine cones on the weathered, guano-spattered platform. It’s a failed osprey nest, taken over by diving terns. “The birds never laid here this year,” said Watts, near the mouth of Virginia’s Chesapeake Bay. “And that's a pattern we've been seeing these last couple of years.” Watts has a more intimate relationship with ospreys than most people have with a bird — he has climbed to their nests to free them from plastic bags, fed them by hand and monitored their eggs with telescopic mirrors. The fish-eating raptor known for gymnastic dives and whistle-like chirps is an American conservation success story. After pesticides and other hazards nearly eliminated the species from much of the country, the hawk-like bird rebounded after the banning of DDT in 1972 and now numbers in the thousands in the U.S. But Watts has documented an alarming trend. The birds, which breed in many parts of the U.S., are failing to successfully fledge enough chicks around their key population center of the Chesapeake Bay. The longtime biologist blames the decline of menhaden, a small schooling fish critical to the osprey diet. Without menhaden to eat, chicks are starving and dying in nests, Watts said. Watts's claim has put him and environmental groups at odds with the fishing industry, trade unions and sometimes government regulators. Menhaden is valuable for fish oil, fish meal and agricultural food as well as bait. U.S. fishermen have caught at least 1.1 billion pounds of menhaden every year since 1951. Members of the industry tout its sustainability and said the decline in osprey may have nothing to do with fishing. But without help, the osprey population could tumble to levels not seen since the dark days of DDT, said Watts, director of the Center for Conservation Biology at The College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia. “The osprey are yelling pretty loudly that, hey, there's not enough menhaden for us to reproduce successfully,” Watts said. “And we should be listening to them to be more informed fully on the fisheries side, and we should take precaution on the fisheries management side. But that hasn't won the day at this point.” Watts, who has studied osprey on the Chesapeake for decades, has backed his claims of population decline by publishing studies in scientific journals. He said it boils down to a simple statistic — to maintain population, osprey pairs need to average 1.15 chicks per year. Osprey were reproducing at that level in the 1980s, but today in some areas around the main stem of the Chesapeake, it's less than half of that, Watts said. In particularly distressed areas, they aren't even reproducing at one-tenth that level, he said. And the decline in available menhaden matches the areas of nesting failure, Watts said. Also called pogies or bunkers, the oily menhaden are especially important for young birds because they are more nutritious than other fish in the sea. Osprey “reproductive performance is inextricably linked to the availability and abundance” of menhaden, Watts wrote in a 2023 study published in Frontiers in Marine Science. Conservationists have been concerned for years, saying too many menhaden have been removed to maintain their crucial role in the ocean food chain. Historian H. Bruce Franklin went so far as to title his 2007 book on menhaden “The Most Important Fish In The Sea.” Menhaden help sustain one of the world's largest fisheries, worth more than $200 million at the docks in 2023. Used as bait, the fish are critical for valuable commercial targets such as Maine lobster. They're also beloved by sportfishermen. The modern industry is dominated by Omega Protein, a Reedville, Virginia, company that is a subsidiary of Canadian aquaculture giant Cooke. The harvesting of the menhaden is performed by an American company, Ocean Harvesters, which is based in Reedville and contracts with Omega, which handles processing. The companies pushed back at the idea that fishing is the cause of osprey decline, although they did acknowledge that fewer menhaden are showing up in some parts of the bay. Federal data show osprey breeding is in decline in many parts of the country, including where menhaden is not harvested at all, said Ben Landry, an Omega spokesperson. Climate change, pollution and development could be playing a role, said Landry and others with the company. Blaming fishing “just reeks of environmental special interest groups having an influence over the process,” Landry said. The menhaden fishery is managed by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, an interstate body that crafts rules and sets fishing quotas. Prompted by questions about ospreys, it created a work group to address precautionary management of the species in the Chesapeake Bay. In April, this group proposed several potential management approaches, including seasonal closures, restrictions on quotas or days at sea, and limitations on kinds of fishing gear. The process of creating new rules could begin this summer, said James Boyle, fishery management plan coordinator with the commission. The osprey population has indeed shown declines in some areas since 2012, but it's important to remember the bird's population is much larger than it was before DDT was banned, Boyle said. “There are big increases in osprey population since the DDT era,” Boyle said, citing federal data showing a six-fold increase in osprey populations along the Atlantic Coast since the 1960s. To a number of environmental groups, any decline is too much. This irritates some labor leaders who worry about losing more jobs as the fishing industry declines. Kenny Pinkard, retired vice president of UFCW Local 400's executive board and a longtime Virginia fishermen, said he feels the industry is being scapegoated. “There are some people who just don't want to see us in business at all,” he said. But Chris Moore, Virginia executive director for Chesapeake Bay Foundation, said the country risks losing an iconic bird if no action is taken. He said Watts's studies show that the osprey will fail without access to menhaden. “Osprey have been a success story,” Moore said. “We're in a situation where they're not replacing their numbers. We'll actually be in a situation where we're in a steep decline.” ___ Whittle reported from Portland, Maine. ___ This story was supported by funding from the Walton Family Foundation.

MarketBeat Week in Review – 07/07 - 07/11,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/marketbeat-week-in-review-07-07-07-11/,"Investors endured another volatile week. Tariff concerns escalated on Friday, jeopardizing the Dow and S&P 500's weekly gains. The NASDAQ, however, continued to hold strong, with one of the week’s highlights being NVIDIA Corp. NASDAQ: NVDA becoming the first company to achieve a $4 trillion market cap. The strong move in NVDA stock highlights the idea that the AI trade is alive and well. For investors, this means that a super cycle in chip stocks is still in its early stages. Next week will bring a firehose of information with inflation data, retail sales data, and the official start of a new earnings season. At this time, expectations are for better-than-expected earnings, but analysts will be watching the guidance closely. The MarketBeat analysts will be doing the same. Here are some of our most popular articles from this week. Articles by Thomas Hughes The MarketBeat site has several free tools that can help investors generate ideas. This week, Thomas Hughes highlighted the Most Upgraded stocks tool, which is frequently a bullish sign, and highlighted three stocks receiving the most upgrades from analysts. Hughes also wrote about Micron Technology Inc. NASDAQ: MU's recent gains. Insiders are selling, but Hughes points out that institutional support after a strong earnings report makes MU stock a clear buying opportunity. SoundHound AI Inc. NASDAQ: SOUN dipped sharply as short interest put pressure on the stock. Hughes noted that pressure has turned into fuel for a rally as positive AI news is causing short covering that could carry through the summer. Articles by Chris Markoch Chris Markoch was one of many MarketBeat analysts who took the opportunity to highlight stocks that may benefit from the ""One Big Beautiful Bill."" The defense budget is growing, and Markoch analyzed three large-cap defense stocks that are likely to have bullish momentum for the rest of 2025 and beyond. The U.S. dollar had its worst first half of the year since 1972. A weak dollar should put pressure on international travel. Markoch cited data that showed that wasn’t the case and explained why that’s bullish for these three travel stocks. Palantir Technologies Inc. NASDAQ: PLTR continues to have valuation concerns. However, Markoch explained why the company is on target to generate $1 billion in revenue in a single quarter for the first time in 2025. That would spotlight the company’s operating leverage and may justify the premium valuation the stock enjoys. Articles by Ryan Hasson Knowing when to take profits is one key to successful investing. This week, Ryan Hasson highlighted three technology stocks showing clear signs of being overbought and ripe for a pullback. Hasson also examined some undervalued stocks this week. But not just any undervalued stocks—Hasson analyzed five dividend stocks with a low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio but a high-yield dividend that offers an attractive payout. Hasson also pointed out the technical signals that Alphabet Inc. NASDAQ: GOOGL is recovering. Although the tech giant has trailed its Mag 7 counterparts this year, Alphabet stock is recovering and may benefit from a strong earnings report. Articles by Gabriel Osorio-Mazilli Cryptocurrency assets made a strong move this week, but Gabriel Osorio-Mazilli points out that, for three companies, a strategic shift to Bitcoin investments is starting to look more like speculation as they give off a 1999 dot-com era feel. This week was Prime Week, which is usually bullish for Amazon.com Inc. NASDAQ: AMZN's e-commerce division. However, a 14% year-over-year decline in the early hours of the event didn't decrease interest in AMZN stock. Osorio-Mazilli highlighted the key technical indicator suggesting further gains in AMZN stock. Apple Inc. NASDAQ: AAPL is one of the laggards in the tech sector and the broader market. Osorio-Mazilli explained why patient investors may want to follow analysts' lead and buy AAPL stock to ride a strong recovery. Articles by Leo Miller A significant line item in the Trump administration’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” removes the tax credits for electric vehicles (EVs) after September 2025. This week, Leo Miller looked at two under-the-radar EV companies and explained why the absence of tax credits may give each stock a charge. Like many healthcare stocks, Centene Corp. NYSE: CNC had a rough week after withdrawing its 2025 full-year guidance. However, Miller pointed out that the 40% sell-off makes CNC stock more attractive strictly based on valuation. But even risk-tolerant investors may want to wait for more clarity around future Medicaid cuts. Data shows that alcohol consumption is dropping in the United States. That would seem to be bearish for Constellation Brands NYSE: STZ, but Constellation is a top-20 stock for Berkshire-Hathaway Inc. NYSE: BRK.B, and recent upgrades may remind investors why it’s tough to bet against Warren Buffett. Articles by Nathan Reiff Equity offerings dilute shareholder value and typically have a negative impact on a stock’s performance. But Nathan Reiff explained why D-Wave Quantum Inc. NYSE: QBTS is bucking that trend. For now, investors are willing to consider the company’s enhanced cash position, which stabilizes it in one of the market’s most attractive sectors. Savvy investors know they don’t have to like the “One Big Beautiful Bill” to profit from it. This week, Reiff put that statement to work and highlighted three stocks that lean into sectors that are likely to be clear winners from the bill. Reiff also analyzed the strong move in cryptocurrency stocks, noting that an increase in the debt ceiling amplifies concerns about U.S. government debt. Like the current bull run in gold, investors should consider these three crypto mining stocks as a way to gain exposure with less risk. Articles by Dan Schmidt A company's value is not the same as its stock price. For example, Costco Wholesale Corp. NASDAQ: COST stock may seem costly, even though the company’s business model performs well and offers good value for consumers. Nonetheless, Dan Schmidt pointed out that opportunistic investors might view BJ’s Wholesale Club Holdings Inc. NYSE: BJ as a short-term buy for better value compared to COST stock. The solar industry expects to face stricter regulations and the removal of the industry’s 30% tax credits at the end of the year. However, Schmidt highlighted several last-minute provisions in the ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" that may benefit these three solar stocks. Articles by Jeffrey Neal Johnson BigBear.ai Holdings Inc. NYSE: BBAI has been one of the best-performing stocks in the last month. BBAI stock is up 90% in the last 30 days as the AI trade has gained steam. This week, Jeffrey Neal Johnson explained the reasons for the recent rally and the analyst sentiment that suggests why BBAI stock can still move higher. Another of 2025’s top performers, AST Spacemobile Inc. NASDAQ: ASTS, has declined sharply over the past 30 days. However, Johnson reminded investors that while traders are taking profits, investors should see this as an opportunity to buy shares at a lower price. Although CAVA Group Inc. NYSE: CAVA is down 19% in 2025, Johnson says analysts still believe the stock’s business model looks tasty. That could be a buying opportunity for fans of a company that’s creating a new category in fast casual dining. Articles by Jordan Chussler Many investors are eyeing a Brian Niccol-led turnaround for Starbucks Corp. NASDAQ: SBUX. But Jordan Chussler pointed out that investors may be finding out what coffee enthusiasts already know. Dutch Bros NYSE: BROS is a name to keep an eye on. Chussler explained why the company’s current and future growth plans may make BROS stock a compelling growth name in this space. Articles by Brian O’Connell UnitedHealth Group NYSE: UNH has been weighing down the Dow index almost by itself. However, Brian O’Connell pointed out that several company insiders and members of Congress have been buying UNH stock in the last 90 days. O’Connell explained how this enthusiasm in UNH stock aligned with a change in the company’s C-Suite, and why it may not be too late for risk-tolerant investors to take a position.

"Russian drone, cruise missile and bomb attacks kill at least 6 in Ukraine",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/russian-drone-and-cruise-missile-attacks-kill-at-least-2-in-ukraine-2025-07-12/,"Russia pounded Ukraine with hundreds of drones and missiles overnight and Saturday as part of a stepped-up bombing campaign that killed at least six people and wounded dozens, officials said. Two people died and 26 were wounded when Russian forces overnight attacked the Bukovina area in the Chernivtsi region of southwestern Ukraine with four drones and a missile, regional Gov. Ruslan Zaparaniuk said Saturday. He said that the two died from falling drone debris. Another drone attack in Ukraine’s western Lviv region wounded 12 people, regional Gov. Maksym Kozytskyi said. Poland’s air force scrambled fighter jets in areas bordering Ukraine in response to the overnight attacks, which targeted again a region that is a crucial hub for receiving foreign military aid. Three people alsos were wounded in Kharkiv in northeastern Ukraine when the city was hit by eight drones and two missiles, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said. Russia fired 597 drones and decoys, along with 26 cruise missiles, into Ukraine overnight into Saturday, Ukraine’s air force said. Of these, 319 drones and 25 cruise missiles were shot down and 258 decoy drones were lost, likely having been electronically jammed. Two people were killed Saturday morning in a missile strike in the Dnipropetrovsk region, according to regional Gov. Serhii Lysak. Two other people were killed Saturday in the Sumy region by a Russian guided bomb, local officials said. Russia has been stepping up its long-range attacks on Ukrainian cities. Earlier this week, Russia fired more than 700 attack and decoy drones, topping previous nightly barrages and targeting Lutsk near the border with Poland in western Ukraine. Russia's intensifying long-range attacks have coincided with a concerted effort to break through parts of the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line, where Ukrainian troops are under severe pressure.

What the ‘black box’ can tell us about plane crashes,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/what-the-black-box-can-tell-us-about-plane-crashes-2025-07-12/,"NEW DELHI (AP) — A preliminary finding into last month’s Air India plane crash has suggested the aircraft’s fuel control switches were turned off, starving the engines of fuel and causing a loss of engine thrust shortly after takeoff. The report, issued by India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau on Saturday, also found that one pilot was heard on the cockpit voice recorder asking the other why he cut off the fuel in the flight’s final moment. The other pilot replied he did not do so. The Air India flight — a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner — crashed on June 12 and killed at least 260 people, including 19 on the ground, in the northwestern city of Ahmedabad. Only one passenger survived the crash, which is one of India’s worst aviation disasters. The report based its finding on the data recovered from the plane’s black boxes — combined cockpit voice recorders and flight data recorders. Here is an explanation of what black boxes are and what they can do: The cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder are tools that help investigators reconstruct the events that lead up to a plane crash. They’re orange in color to make them easier to find in wreckage, sometimes at great ocean depths. They’re usually installed a plane’s tail section, which is considered the most survivable part of the aircraft, according to the National Transportation Safety Board's website. The cockpit voice recorder collects radio transmissions and sounds such as the pilot’s voices and engine noises, according to the NTSB’s website. Depending on what happened, investigators may pay close attention to the engine noise, stall warnings and other clicks and pops, the NTSB said. And from those sounds, investigators can often determine engine speed and the failure of some systems. Investigators can also listen to conversations between the pilots and crew and communications with air traffic control. Experts make a meticulous transcript of the voice recording, which can take up to a week. The flight data recorder monitors a plane’s altitude, airspeed and heading, according to the NTSB. Those factors are among at least 88 parameters that newly built planes must monitor. Some can collect the status of more than 1,000 other characteristics, from a wing’s flap position to the smoke alarms. The NTSB said it can generate a computer animated video reconstruction of the flight from the information collected. At least two people have been credited with creating devices that record what happens on an airplane. One is French aviation engineer François Hussenot. In the 1930s, he found a way to record a plane’s speed, altitude and other parameters onto photographic film, according to the website for European plane-maker Airbus. In the 1950s, Australian scientist David Warren came up with the idea for the cockpit voice recorder, according to his 2010 AP obituary. Warren had been investigating the crash of the world’s first commercial jet airliner, the Comet, in 1953, and thought it would be helpful for airline accident investigators to have a recording of voices in the cockpit, the Australian Department of Defence said in a statement after his death. Warren designed and constructed a prototype in 1956. But it took several years before officials understood just how valuable the device could be and began installing them in commercial airlines worldwide. Some have suggested that it stems from Hussenot’s device because it used film and “ran continuously in a light-tight box, hence the name ‘black box,’” according to Airbus, which noted that orange was the box’s chosen color from the beginning to make it easy to find. Other theories include the boxes turning black when they get charred in a crash, the Smithsonian Magazine wrote in 2019. The media continues to use the term, the magazine wrote, “because of the sense of mystery it conveys in the aftermath of an air disaster.”","The report, issued by India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau on Saturday, also found that one pilot was heard on the cockpit voice recorder asking the other why he cut off the fuel in the flight’s final moment.","Some have suggested that it stems from Hussenot’s device because it used film and “ran continuously in a light-tight box, hence the name ‘black box,’” according to Airbus, which noted that orange was the box’s chosen color from the beginning to make it easy to find.",But it took several years before officials understood just how valuable the device could be and began installing them in commercial airlines worldwide.,"Warren had been investigating the crash of the world’s first commercial jet airliner, the Comet, in 1953, and thought it would be helpful for airline accident investigators to have a recording of voices in the cockpit, the Australian Department of Defence said in a statement after his death."
"DOGE sprouts in red states, as governors embrace the cost-cutter brand and make it their own",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/doge-sprouts-in-red-states-as-governors-embrace-the-cost-cutter-brand-and-make-it-their-own-2025-07-12/,"HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — The brash and chaotic first days of President Donald Trump 's Department of Government Efficiency, once led by the world's richest man Elon Musk, spawned state-level DOGE mimicry as Republican governors and lawmakers aim to show they are in step with their party's leader. Governors have always made political hay out of slashing waste or taming bureaucracy, but DOGE has, in some ways, raised the stakes for them to show that they are zealously committed to cutting costs. Many drive home the point that they have always been focused on cutting government, even if they're not conducting mass layoffs. “I like to say we were doing DOGE before DOGE was a thing,” Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said in announcing her own task force in January. Critics agree that some of these initiatives are nothing new and suggest they are wasteful, essentially duplicating built-in processes that are normally the domain of legislative committees or independent state auditors. At the same time, some governors are using their DOGE vehicles to take aim at GOP targets of the moment, such as welfare programs or diversity, equity and inclusion programs. And some governors who might be eyeing a White House run in 2028 are rebranding their cost-cutting initiatives as DOGE, perhaps eager to claim the mantle of the most DOGE of them all. At least 26 states have initiated DOGE-style efforts of varying kinds, according to the Economic Policy Institute based in Washington, D.C. Most DOGE efforts were carried out through a governor’s order — including by governors in Florida, Iowa, Louisiana, Montana, New Hampshire and Oklahoma — or by lawmakers introducing legislation or creating a legislative committee. The state initiatives have a markedly different character than Trump’s slash-and-burn approach, symbolized by Musk’s chainsaw-brandishing appearance at a Conservative Political Action Committee appearance in February. Governors are tending to entrust their DOGE bureaus to loyalists, rather than independent auditors, and are often employing what could be yearslong processes to consolidate procurement, modernize information technology systems, introduce AI tools, repeal regulations or reduce car fleets, office leases or worker headcounts through attrition. Steve Slivinski, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute who researches state government regulatory structures, said that a lot of what he has seen from state-level DOGE initiatives are the “same stuff you do on a pretty regular basis anyway” in state governments. States typically have routine auditing procedures and the ways states have of saving money are “relatively unsexy,"" Slivinski said. And while the state-level DOGE vehicles might be useful over time in finding marginal improvements, ""branding it DOGE is more of a press op rather than anything new or substantially different than what they usually do,” Slivinski said. Analysts at the pro-labor Economic Policy Institute say that governors and lawmakers, primarily in the South and Midwest, are using DOGE to breathe new life into long-term agendas to consolidate power away from state agencies and civil servants, dismantle public services and benefit insiders and privatization advocates. “It's not actually about cutting costs because of some fiscal responsibility,” EPI analyst Nina Mast said. Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry rebranded his “Fiscal Responsibility Program” as Louisiana DOGE, and promoted it as the first to team up with the federal government to scrub illegitimate enrollees from welfare programs. It has already netted $70 million in savings in the Medicaid program in an “unprecedented” coordination, Landry said in June. In Oklahoma, Gov. Kevin Stitt — who says in a blurb on the Oklahoma DOGE website that “I’ve been DOGE-ing in Oklahoma since before it was cool"" — made a DOGE splash with the first report by his Division of Government Efficiency by declaring that the state would refuse some $157 million in federal public health grants. The biggest chunk of that was $132 million intended to support epidemiology and laboratory capacity to control infectious disease outbreaks. The Stitt administration said that funding — about one-third of the total over an eight-year period — exceeded the amount needed. The left-leaning Oklahoma Policy Institute questioned the wisdom of that, pointing to rising numbers of measles and whooping cough cases and the rocky transition under Stitt of the state's public health lab from Oklahoma City to Stillwater. Oklahoma Democrats issued rebukes, citing Oklahoma's lousy public health rankings. “This isn’t leadership,” state Sen. Carri Hicks said. ”It’s negligence."" Stitt's Oklahoma DOGE has otherwise recommended changes in federal law to save money, opened up the suggestion box to state employees and members of the general public and posted a spreadsheet online with cost savings initiatives in his administration. Those include things as mundane as agencies going paperless, refinancing bonds, buying automated lawn mowers for the Capitol grounds or eliminating a fax machine line in the State Board of Licensure for Professional Engineers and Surveyors. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed an executive order in February creating a task force of DOGE teams in each state agency. In the order, DeSantis recited 10 points on what he described as his and Florida’s “history of prudent fiscal management” even before DOGE. Among other things, DeSantis vowed to scrutinize spending by state universities and municipal and county governments — including on DEI initiatives — at a time when DeSantis is pushing to abolish the property taxes that predominantly fund local governments. His administration has since issued letters to universities and governments requesting reams of information and received a blessing from lawmakers, who passed legislation authorizing the inquiry and imposing fines for entities that don’t respond. After the June 30 signing ceremony, DeSantis declared on social media: “We now have full authority to DOGE local governments.” In Arkansas, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders launched her cost-cutting Arkansas Forward last year, before DOGE, and later said the state had done the “same thing” as DOGE. Her administration spent much of 2024 compiling a 97-page report that listed hundreds of ways to possibly save $300 million inside a $6.5 billion budget. Achieving that savings — largely by standardizing information technology and purchasing — would sometimes require up-front spending and take years to realize savings. ___ Follow Marc Levy on X at: https://x.com/timelywriter","Kevin Stitt — who says in a blurb on the Oklahoma DOGE website that “I’ve been DOGE-ing in Oklahoma since before it was cool"" — made a DOGE splash with the first report by his Division of Government Efficiency by declaring that the state would refuse some $157 million in federal public health grants.","Kevin Stitt — who says in a blurb on the Oklahoma DOGE website that “I’ve been DOGE-ing in Oklahoma since before it was cool"" — made a DOGE splash with the first report by his Division of Government Efficiency by declaring that the state would refuse some $157 million in federal public health grants.","In the order, DeSantis recited 10 points on what he described as his and Florida’s “history of prudent fiscal management” even before DOGE.","Kevin Stitt — who says in a blurb on the Oklahoma DOGE website that “I’ve been DOGE-ing in Oklahoma since before it was cool"" — made a DOGE splash with the first report by his Division of Government Efficiency by declaring that the state would refuse some $157 million in federal public health grants."
Beat the heat with these cooling gadgets and wearables,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/beat-the-heat-with-these-cooling-gadgets-and-wearables-2025-07-11/,"You can only sit in front of the fridge with the door open for so long. As heat waves blast the world like a blow dryer on high, folks are reaching for anything that promises a little personal chill: portable mini fans, cooling neck wraps, high-tech vests and all kinds of heat-beating headwear. Of course, cooling gear helps most when paired with basic and safe strategies against the heat: most importantly hydration, shade and rest. Stay out of extreme heat when possible, and know the signs of heat exhaustion or heat stroke. Yet these wearable wonders and breezy gadgets can offer some relief. They might look quirky, but when the AC struggles and the sidewalk feels like a stovetop, they can start to seem like must-haves. Indoors, stay comfy with cool-feel sheets (like those with a silky finish or lightweight fibers), bed fans (where a nozzle inserted into the bed linens pumps a flow of air around you), or a cooling pillow or chill pad, which are filled with a gel that can stay cool for hours. Sleep-product brands include Serta, Sealy, Casper, Pluto and Threshold. The chill pads can work for your own bed and the pets' bed too. There are chillable full-size mattresses (Chilipad, 8Sleep and BedJet get good reviews from The Spruce) and smaller, simple pads (CoolCare and Sharper Image, among others). Clare Epstein, an employee safety expert with Vector Solutions in Tampa, Florida, works to reduce heat stress for at-risk employees in industries like construction, aviation and agriculture. She recommends wearables like cooling scarves and evaporative cooling vests. “By soaking the fabric in cold water at the beginning of the day, the vest slowly cools, and keeps the wearer cool,"" she says. Clothes made of “phase change materials,” or PCMs, contain gel capsules or pads that can help moderate body temperatures. Uline.com advertises a vest that stays under 60 degrees for a few hours, and AlphaCool offers a neck tube that performs similarly. Another feature of the tube, which is made of a polymer material, is that it doesn’t get overly chilled, so it’s safe for kids to use. Also for kids, there’s a line of plush toys from Warmies that includes little critters of the farmyard, ocean, forest and safari that can be popped in the freezer before a trip to the park or playground. Wearable items that incorporate small fans or thermoelectric coolers are also good, Epstein says. And there are vests with tubed reservoirs you can fill with water or electrolytes so you can sip as you go. “These encourage people to take more water breaks, and stay hydrated,” says Epstein. The wearables range is extensive. Along with cooling buffs, headbands, wristbands, socks and scarves, there are cooling brimmed hats and ball caps. Brands include Mission, Ergodyne, and Sunday Afternoon. If you’d prefer a refreshing breeze, USB-chargeable handheld or wearable fans might do the job. Lynn Campbell, co-founder of 10Adventures travel company in Calgary, Alberta, takes a lot of strenuous hiking and cycling trips with her husband, Richard. They've developed some easy hacks for hot days. “We’ll wake up early, so we’re done by 10 or 11 a.m., or if we’re out on the trails, split the day in two, so we rest by water or in the shade over the hottest part” of the day, she says. Wear light colors and thin, breathable fabrics. And bring an umbrella. “This is a game-changer,” Campbell says. “Now we always pack ultralight, compact ones; they’re incredible.” Also, pour cool water on your head and back. “We freeze a few bottles of water so we can pour ice water on us to cool down,” Campbell says. ""Putting the bottles under the armpits, in the groin, or on the back of the neck can effectively cool a person down.” And Annita Katee, a contributing writer for Apartment Therapy, has another way to prep your bed on hot nights: “Pop your sheets into the freezer at least two hours before bedtime, then pull them out right before you hit the sack,” she wrote in a recent post.

"Judge orders Trump administration to halt indiscriminate immigration stops, arrests in California",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/judge-orders-trump-administration-to-halt-indiscriminate-immigration-stops-arrests-in-california-2025-07-11/,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — A federal judge on Friday ordered the Trump administration to halt indiscriminate immigration stops and arrests in seven California counties, including Los Angeles. Immigrant advocacy groups filed the lawsuit last week accusing President Donald Trump’s administration of systematically targeting brown-skinned people in Southern California during its ongoing immigration crackdown. The plaintiffs include three detained immigrants and two U.S. citizens, one of whom was held despite showing agents his identification. The filing in U.S. District Court asked a judge to block the administration from using what they call unconstitutional tactics in immigration raids. Immigrant advocates accuse immigration officials of detaining someone based on their race, carrying out warrantless arrests, and denying detainees access to legal counsel at a holding facility in downtown LA. Judge Maame E. Frimpong also issued a separate order barring the federal government from restricting attorney access at a Los Angeles immigration detention facility in response to a request from nonprofit law firm Public Counsel. Frimpong issued the emergency orders, which are a temporary measure while the lawsuit proceeds, the day after a hearing during which advocacy groups argued that the government was violating the Fourth and Fifth amendments of the Constitution. She wrote in the order there was a “mountain of evidence” presented in the case that the federal government was committing the violations they were being accused of. The White House responded quickly to the ruling late Friday. “No federal judge has the authority to dictate immigration policy — that authority rests with Congress and the President,” spokesperson Abigail Jackson said. “Enforcement operations require careful planning and execution; skills far beyond the purview (or) jurisdiction of any judge. We expect this gross overstep of judicial authority to be corrected on appeal.” Immigrants and Latino communities across Southern California have been on edge for weeks since the Trump administration stepped up arrests at car washes, Home Depot parking lots, immigration courts and a range of businesses. Tens of thousands of people have participated in rallies in the region over the raids and the subsequent deployment of the National Guard and Marines. The order also applies to Ventura County, where busloads of workers were detained Thursday while the court hearing was underway after federal agents descended on a cannabis farm, leading to clashes with protesters and multiple injuries. According to the American Civil Liberties Union, the recent wave of immigration enforcement has been driven by an “arbitrary arrest quota” and based on “broad stereotypes based on race or ethnicity.” When detaining the three day laborers who are plaintiffs in the lawsuit, all immigration agents knew about them is that they were Latino and were dressed in construction work clothes, the filing in the lawsuit said. It goes on to describe raids at swap meets and Home Depots where witnesses say federal agents grabbed anyone who “looked Hispanic.” Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, said in an email that “any claims that individuals have been ‘targeted’ by law enforcement because of their skin color are disgusting and categorically FALSE.” McLaughlin said “enforcement operations are highly targeted, and officers do their due diligence” before making arrests. After the ruling, she said “a district judge is undermining the will of the American people.” ACLU attorney Mohammad Tajsar said Brian Gavidia, one of the U.S. citizens who was detained, was “physically assaulted ... for no other reason than he was Latino and working at a tow yard in a predominantly Latin American neighborhood.” Tajsar asked why immigration agents detained everyone at a car wash except two white workers, according to a declaration by a car wash worker, if race wasn’t involved. Representing the government, attorney Sean Skedzielewski said there was no evidence that federal immigration agents considered race in their arrests, and that they only considered appearance as part of the “totality of the circumstances”, including prior surveillance and interactions with people in the field. In some cases, they also operated off “targeted, individualized packages,” he said. “The Department of Homeland Security has policy and training to ensure compliance with the Fourth Amendment,” Skedzielewski said. Lawyers from Immigrant Defenders Law Center and other groups say they also have been denied access to a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in downtown LA known as “B-18” on several occasions since June, according to court documents. Public Counsel lawyer Mark Rosenbaum said in one incident on June 7 attorneys “attempted to shout out basic rights” at a bus of people detained by immigration agents in downtown LA when the government drivers honked their horns to drown them out and chemical munitions akin to tear gas were deployed. Skedzielewski said access was only restricted to “protect the employees and the detainees” during violent protests and it has since been restored. Rosenbaum said lawyers were denied access even on days without any demonstrations nearby, and that the people detained are also not given sufficient access to phones or informed that lawyers were available to them. He said the facility lacks adequate food and beds, which he called “coercive” to getting people to sign papers to agree to leave the country before consulting an attorney. Friday’s order will temporarily prevent the government from solely using apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or English with an accent, presence at a location such as a tow yard or car wash, or someone's occupation as the basis for reasonable suspicion to stop someone. It will also require officials to open B-18 to visitation by attorneys seven days a week and provide detainees access to confidential phone calls with attorneys. Attorneys general for 18 Democratic states also filed briefs in support of the orders. U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents were already barred from making warrantless arrests in a large swath of eastern California after a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction in April.","After the ruling, she said “a district judge is undermining the will of the American people.” ACLU attorney Mohammad Tajsar said Brian Gavidia, one of the U.S. citizens who was detained, was “physically assaulted ... for no other reason than he was Latino and working at a tow yard in a predominantly Latin American neighborhood.” Tajsar asked why immigration agents detained everyone at a car wash except two white workers, according to a declaration by a car wash worker, if race wasn’t involved.","After the ruling, she said “a district judge is undermining the will of the American people.” ACLU attorney Mohammad Tajsar said Brian Gavidia, one of the U.S. citizens who was detained, was “physically assaulted ... for no other reason than he was Latino and working at a tow yard in a predominantly Latin American neighborhood.” Tajsar asked why immigration agents detained everyone at a car wash except two white workers, according to a declaration by a car wash worker, if race wasn’t involved.","Immigrant advocates accuse immigration officials of detaining someone based on their race, carrying out warrantless arrests, and denying detainees access to legal counsel at a holding facility in downtown LA.","According to the American Civil Liberties Union, the recent wave of immigration enforcement has been driven by an “arbitrary arrest quota” and based on “broad stereotypes based on race or ethnicity.” When detaining the three day laborers who are plaintiffs in the lawsuit, all immigration agents knew about them is that they were Latino and were dressed in construction work clothes, the filing in the lawsuit said."
Boeing settles with a man whose family died in a 737 Max crash in Ethiopia,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/boeing-settles-with-a-man-whose-family-died-in-a-737-max-crash-in-ethiopia-2025-07-11/,"CHICAGO (AP) — Boeing reached a settlement Friday with a Canadian man whose wife and three children were killed in a deadly 2019 crash in Ethiopia, averting the first trial connected to a devastating event that led to a worldwide grounding of Max jets. The jury trial at Chicago’s federal court had been set to start Monday to determine damages for Paul Njoroge of Canada. His family was heading to their native Kenya in March 2019 aboard Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 when it malfunctioned and plummeted to the ground. The wreck killed all 157 people on board. Njoroge, 41, had planned to testify about how the crash affected his life. He has been unable to return to his family home in Toronto because the memories are too painful. He hasn’t been able to find a job. And he has weathered criticism from relatives for not traveling alongside his wife and children. “He’s got complicated grief and sorrow and his own emotional stress,” said Njoroge’s attorney, Robert Clifford. “He’s haunted by nightmares and the loss of his wife and children.” Terms of the deal were not disclosed publicly. Clifford said his client intended to seek “millions” in damages on behalf of his wife and children, but declined to publicly specify an amount ahead of the trial. “The aviation team at Clifford Law Offices has been working round-the-clock in preparation for trial, but the mediator was able to help the parties come to an agreement,” Clifford said in a statement Friday. A Boeing spokesperson said via email Friday that the company had no comment. The proceedings were not expected to delve into technicalities involving the Max version of Boeing’s bestselling 737 airplane, which has been the source of persistent troubles for the company since the Ethiopia crash and one the year before in Indonesia. A combined 346 people, including passengers and crew members, died in those crashes. In 2021, Chicago-based Boeing accepted responsibility for the Ethiopia crash in a deal with the victims’ families that allowed them to pursue individual claims in U.S. courts instead of their home countries. Citizens of 35 countries were killed. Several families of victims have already settled. Terms of those agreements also were not made public. The jetliner heading to Nairobi lost control shortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa Bole International Airport and nose-dived into a barren patch of land. Investigators determined the Ethiopia and Indonesia crashes were caused by a system that relied on a sensor that provided faulty readings and pushed the plane noses down, leaving pilots unable to regain control. After the Ethiopia crash, Max jets were grounded worldwide until the company redesigned the system. This year, Boeing reached a deal with the U.S. Justice Department to avoid criminal prosecutions in both crashes. Among those killed were Njoroge’s wife, Carolyne, and three small children, Ryan, age 6, Kellie, 4, and Rubi, 9 months old, the youngest to die on the plane. Njoroge also lost his mother-in-law, whose family has a separate case. Njoroge, who met his wife in college in Nairobi, was living in Canada at the time of the crash. He had planned to join his family in Kenya later. He testified before Congress in 2019 about repeatedly imagining how his family suffered during the flight, which lasted only six minutes. He has pictured his wife struggling to hold their infant in her lap with two other children seated nearby. “I stay up nights thinking of the horror that they must have endured,” Njoroge said. “The six minutes will forever be embedded in my mind. I was not there to help them. I couldn’t save them.”","CHICAGO (AP) — Boeing reached a settlement Friday with a Canadian man whose wife and three children were killed in a deadly 2019 crash in Ethiopia, averting the first trial connected to a devastating event that led to a worldwide grounding of Max jets.","CHICAGO (AP) — Boeing reached a settlement Friday with a Canadian man whose wife and three children were killed in a deadly 2019 crash in Ethiopia, averting the first trial connected to a devastating event that led to a worldwide grounding of Max jets.",The jetliner heading to Nairobi lost control shortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa Bole International Airport and nose-dived into a barren patch of land.,"The proceedings were not expected to delve into technicalities involving the Max version of Boeing’s bestselling 737 airplane, which has been the source of persistent troubles for the company since the Ethiopia crash and one the year before in Indonesia."

Trump's sudden shifts make his policies baffling to countries trying to negotiate lower tariffs,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trumps-sudden-shifts-make-his-policies-baffling-to-countries-trying-to-negotiate-lower-tariffs-2025-07-12/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — In the past week, President Donald Trump has managed to make his erratic trade policies even more baffling to countries desperate to negotiate an escape from his wrath. Doubling down on his trade wars, Trump is threatening to raise taxes on many goods from Canada, hike his universal tariff on imports from around the world and punish Brazil for prosecuting his friend, the country’s former president. On Saturday, Trump announced more tariffs still, this time on two of the United States’ biggest trade partners: the European Union and Mexico, at 30% each. Former U.S. trade negotiator Wendy Cutler said that Trump’s recent moves “underscore the growing unpredictability, incoherence and assertiveness’’ of his trade policies. “It’s hard for trading partners to know where they stand with Trump on any given day and what more may be coming their way when least expected,’’ said Cutler, now vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute. On Thursday, the president escalated a conflict he started with America’s second-biggest trading partner and longstanding ally, raising the tariff -- effectively a tax — on many Canadian imports to 35% effective Aug. 1. The sudden announcement, revealed in a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, came despite Carney’s push to reach a trade deal with the United States by July 21. And it followed a big concession by Canada: On June 29, it had agreed to drop a digital services tax that Trump considered unfair to U.S. tech giants. Canada is far from the only target. In an interview Thursday with NBC News Trump suggested that he plans to raise his “baseline’’ tariff on most imports from an already-high 10% to as much as 20%. Trump sees the baseline tariffs as a way to finance the budget-busting tax cuts in the ""One Big Beautiful Bill'' he signed into law July 4. Those tariff threats came after his extraordinary decision Wednesday to impose a 50% import tax on Brazil mainly because he didn’t like the way it was treating former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, who is facing trial for trying to overturn his electoral defeat in 2022. In his letter to current Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Trump also incorrectly claimed that Brazilian trade barriers had caused “unsustainable Trade Deficits against the United States.’’ In fact, U.S. exports to Brazil have exceeded imports for 18 straight years, including a $29 billion surplus last year. For some, Trump's action against Brazil indicates he's trying to exert influence over more than trade. “Trump seems to view tariffs as an instrument to influence not just other countries’ trade and economic policies but even their domestic legal and political matters,"" said Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University. Trump’s faith in the economic superpowers of tariffs is unshaken even though they so far have proven largely ineffective in bullying other countries to cut deals. On April 2, Trump announced the 10% baseline tariffs and larger “reciprocal’’ tariffs – up to 50% -- on dozens of countries with which the United States runs trade deficits. But responding to a rout in global financial markets, he quickly suspended the reciprocal tariffs for 90 days to give countries a chance to negotiate. The administration promised “90 deals in 90 days’’ but got only two – with the United Kingdom and Vietnam -- before the deadline ran out Wednesday. Rather than reinstituting the reciprocal tariffs, Trump sent letters to 23 countries saying he’ll impose levies ranging from 20% on the Philippines to the 50% on Brazil Aug. 1 if they couldn’t reach an agreement. Chad Bown, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, was not surprised that Trump needed more time to press U.S. trading partners to do more to open their markets to U.S. exports — though another three weeks is unlikely to be enough time to reach substantive agreements. “For each of these countries, they have their own domestic challenges about what they can and can’t offer,’’ he said. “There’s a reason why that market access hasn’t been granted before ... they have domestic political constituencies that argue to keep protection in place. And those just aren’t problems that can easily be solved in a matter of weeks.’’ Malaysia, for instance, has “specific red lines’’ it will not cross, Trade Minister Zafrul Aziz said Wednesday, including U.S. demands involving government contracts, halal certification, medical standards and a digital tax. But Malaysia has pledged to buy 30 Boeing planes and offered other concessions involving semiconductors and technology. “It has to be fair,” he said. “If the deal does not benefit Malaysia, we should not have a deal.’’ Still, the United States’ $30 trillion economy and free-spending consumers give Trump considerable leverage, especially over countries that depend on trade. “These countries need the United States,’’ said Matthew Goodman, director of the Council on Foreign Relations’ Center for Geoeconomic Studies. ""They need our market.’’ Thailand, facing the threat of a 36% Trump tariff Aug. 1, is continuing to push for a deal and has offered to open its market to more U.S. farm, energy and industrial products. Trump said Vietnam gave U.S. companies duty-free access to its market while agreeing to a 20% U.S. tariff on its exports — though details of the deal have not been released. “The Vietnam deal was fantastic,’’ Stephen Miran, chair of Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers, crowed last Sunday on ABC News’ “This Week with George Stephanopoulos.’’ “It’s extremely one-sided.’’ Other countries “can’t afford to walk away,'’ said Goodman, former director for international economics on the National Security Council. “But they’re going to be increasingly unhappy and resistant to the most over-the-top requests.’’ Sometimes there’s a backlash against U.S. bullying. Carney’s Liberal party, for example, won a come-from-behind election victory in April because he stood up to Trump’s pressure. And countries are beginning to look for alternatives to economic reliance on the United States. Canada is negotiating a trade pact with Southeast Asian countries, some of which are also moving closer to China. Foreign governments might also simply hope to outlast Trump, who has shown a willingness to declare victory after signing “framework’’ agreements such as one with China that leave the toughest issues for future negotiations. “For Trump, the squeeze is more important than the juice,” said William Reinsch, a former U.S. trade official now at the Center of Strategic and International Studies. “What’s important to him is winning – the public, visible appearance of winning. And what he wins is less important. “So the trick for these countries becomes: ‘How do we let him win in a way that allows us to make the least damaging concessions?’” ____ Eileen Ng in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, contributed to this story.","On April 2, Trump announced the 10% baseline tariffs and larger “reciprocal’’ tariffs – up to 50% -- on dozens of countries with which the United States runs trade deficits.","Chad Bown, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, was not surprised that Trump needed more time to press U.S. trading partners to do more to open their markets to U.S. exports — though another three weeks is unlikely to be enough time to reach substantive agreements.","“It’s hard for trading partners to know where they stand with Trump on any given day and what more may be coming their way when least expected,’’ said Cutler, now vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute.","Chad Bown, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, was not surprised that Trump needed more time to press U.S. trading partners to do more to open their markets to U.S. exports — though another three weeks is unlikely to be enough time to reach substantive agreements."
British man extradited to US to face federal charges in alleged $99 million wine scam,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/british-man-extradited-to-us-to-face-federal-charges-in-alleged-99-million-wine-scam-2025-07-11/,"NEW YORK (AP) — A British man has been brought to the U.S. to face charges in connection with an alleged $99 million Ponzi-like fraud involving expensive wines. James Wellesley, 58, pleaded not guilty during his arraignment Friday in Brooklyn federal court following his extradition from the United Kingdom, where he was arrested in 2022. He was ordered detained by a judge pending trial on wire fraud and money laundering charges. A lawyer for Wellesley didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment. His co-defendant, Stephen Burton, was extradited from Morocco in 2023 after using a bogus Zimbabwean passport to enter that country. Burton, a 60-year-old British national, has also been detained and pleaded not guilty to similar charges in the same Brooklyn court. Prosecutors say the two men ran a company called Bordeaux Cellars that brokered loans between investors and wealthy wine collectors that were secured by their wine collections. From 2017 to 2019, they solicited $99 million in investments from residents of New York and other areas, promising their clients that they would profit from interest on the loans. But the wealthy wine collectors did not exist, no loans were made, and Bordeaux Cellars did not have custody of the wine securing the loans, prosecutors say. Instead, Burton and Wellesley used loan money provided by investors for themselves and to make fraudulent interest payments to other investors, prosecutors alleged. If convicted, the two face up to 20 years in prison each.","Burton, a 60-year-old British national, has also been detained and pleaded not guilty to similar charges in the same Brooklyn court.","But the wealthy wine collectors did not exist, no loans were made, and Bordeaux Cellars did not have custody of the wine securing the loans, prosecutors say.","Burton, a 60-year-old British national, has also been detained and pleaded not guilty to similar charges in the same Brooklyn court.","But the wealthy wine collectors did not exist, no loans were made, and Bordeaux Cellars did not have custody of the wine securing the loans, prosecutors say."

The Meteoric Rise of Rocket Lab: A Space Stock to Watch,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/the-meteoric-rise-of-rocket-lab-a-space-stock-to-watch/,"Rocket Lab USA NASDAQ: RKLB has quickly evolved from a niche launch provider into one of the most exciting space and defense industry players. With shares up nearly 700% over the past 12 months, the stock has garnered significant attention, and for good reason. Rocket Lab continues to outperform through execution, momentum, and meaningful contract wins. Rocket Lab's story is becoming hard to ignore for investors who are just discovering the company. Rocket Lab was founded in 2006 by CEO Peter Beck and went public via SPAC in 2021. Initially known for its small satellite launch capabilities via its Electron rocket, the company has since expanded into spacecraft manufacturing, satellite components, and now satellite payloads. Electron remains Rocket Lab’s workhorse. It’s one of the most frequently launched small rockets globally, with 68 successful missions to date. However, what truly sets RKLB apart is its vertical integration. The company designs and builds nearly every aspect of its missions in-house, from solar panels and reaction wheels to full satellite buses. This enables Rocket Lab to maintain cost control, ensure quality, and execute more quickly than many of its competitors. RKLB has delivered one of the most impressive runs in the market over the past year. Shares have surged nearly 700% over the last 12 months, fueled by improving fundamentals, strong contract wins, and a growing reputation as a reliable launch and space systems provider. Year-to-date, the stock has risen an impressive 53% and is fresh from making a new all-time high on Tuesday. Just last month, the company completed its 68th successful Electron launch, just 48 hours after the 67th, marking its fastest turnaround yet from its New Zealand launch complex. Rocket Lab completed four missions in June alone, bringing its year-to-date tally for 2025 to ten launches with a 100% success rate. This reliability is critical as the space economy becomes increasingly essential to both commercial and government interests. A string of recent achievements underpins Rocket Lab’s momentum. Most recently, the company announced it had completed the Critical Design Review (CDR) for the U.S. Space Development Agency’s T2TL-Beta constellation. As the program’s prime contractor, Rocket Lab will deliver 18 satellites for the Department of Defense’s Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture. An initiative that aims to build a secure, low-latency LEO communications network for U.S. and allied forces. This milestone clears the way for full-scale production and cements Rocket Lab’s transition from launch services into full-scale satellite manufacturing and national security work. Peter Beck recently confirmed on CNBC that the company remains on track to debut its Neutron rocket. It’s a reusable, medium-lift vehicle, expected to be operational by the end of this year. If successful, Neutron would enable Rocket Lab to compete directly with SpaceX in the medium-lift launch category and significantly expand its addressable market. In short, if successful, Neutron would catapult RKLB to the next level. Beck also highlighted the strategic acquisition of GEOST, which brings space-based sensing and payload capabilities into Rocket Lab’s portfolio. This is yet another step toward becoming an end-to-end space solutions provider. Analysts have begun to take note of Rocket Lab’s upward trajectory. Cantor Fitzgerald recently raised its price target to a Street-high $35, citing the company’s strategic execution and growing backlog. Overall, sentiment remains bullish, particularly as the company approaches its first Neutron launch. The stock has a Moderate Buy rating based on 12 ratings. However, the consensus price target, which implies a 22% downside potential, raises some concerns regarding the company's current valuation. Rocket Lab’s meteoric rise is no accident. With strong leadership, accelerating execution, and a growing list of high-profile contracts, the company is transforming from a niche launch firm into a full-fledged aerospace and defense powerhouse. For investors looking for long-term growth potential in a sector with tailwinds from both government and commercial demand, Rocket Lab remains one of the most compelling and dynamic names in the space.

Musk's latest Grok chatbot searches for billionaire mogul's views before answering questions,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/musks-latest-grok-chatbot-searches-for-billionaire-moguls-views-before-answering-questions-2025-07-11/,"The latest version of Elon Musk's artificial intelligence chatbot Grok is echoing the views of its billionaire creator, so much so that it will sometimes search online for Musk's stance on an issue before offering up an opinion. The unusual behavior of Grok 4, the AI model that Musk's company xAI released late Wednesday, has surprised some experts. Built using huge amounts of computing power at a Tennessee data center, Grok is Musk's attempt to outdo rivals such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini in building an AI assistant that shows its reasoning before answering a question. Musk's deliberate efforts to mold Grok into a challenger of what he considers the tech industry's “woke” orthodoxy on race, gender and politics has repeatedly got the chatbot into trouble, most recently when it spouted antisemitic tropes, praised Adolf Hitler and made other hateful commentary to users of Musk's X social media platform just days before Grok 4's launch. But its tendency to consult with Musk's opinions appears to be a different problem. “It’s extraordinary,” said Simon Willison, an independent AI researcher who's been testing the tool. ""You can ask it a sort of pointed question that is around controversial topics. And then you can watch it literally do a search on X for what Elon Musk said about this, as part of its research into how it should reply."" One example widely shared on social media — and which Willison duplicated — asked Grok to comment on the conflict in the Middle East. The prompted question made no mention of Musk, but the chatbot looked for his guidance anyway. As a so-called reasoning model, much like those made by rivals OpenAI or Anthropic, Grok 4 shows its “thinking” as it goes through the steps of processing a question and coming up with an answer. Part of that thinking this week involved searching X, the former Twitter that's now merged into xAI, for anything Musk said about Israel, Palestine, Gaza or Hamas. “Elon Musk’s stance could provide context, given his influence,” the chatbot told Willison, according to a video of the interaction. “Currently looking at his views to see if they guide the answer.” Musk and his xAI co-founders introduced the new chatbot in a livestreamed event Wednesday night but haven't published a technical explanation of its workings — known as a system card — that companies in the AI industry typically provide when introducing a new model. The company also didn't respond to an emailed request for comment Friday. “In the past, strange behavior like this was due to system prompt changes,"" which is when engineers program specific instructions to guide a chatbot's response, said Tim Kellogg, principal AI architect at software company Icertis. “But this one seems baked into the core of Grok and it’s not clear to me how that happens,” Kellogg said. ""It seems that Musk’s effort to create a maximally truthful AI has somehow led to it believing its own values must align with Musk’s own values.” The lack of transparency is troubling for computer scientist Talia Ringer, a professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign who earlier in the week criticized the company's handling of the technology's antisemitic outbursts. Ringer said the most plausible explanation for Grok's search for Musk's guidance is assuming the person is asking for the opinions of xAI or Musk. “I think people are expecting opinions out of a reasoning model that cannot respond with opinions,"" Ringer said. ""So, for example, it interprets ‘Who do you support, Israel or Palestine?’ as 'Who does xAI leadership support?” Willison also said he finds Grok 4's capabilities impressive but said people buying software ""don’t want surprises like it turning into ‘mechaHitler’ or deciding to search for what Musk thinks about issues.” “Grok 4 looks like it’s a very strong model. It’s doing great in all of the benchmarks,” Willison said. “But if I’m going to build software on top of it, I need transparency.”","And then you can watch it literally do a search on X for what Elon Musk said about this, as part of its research into how it should reply.""",“Currently looking at his views to see if they guide the answer.” Musk and his xAI co-founders introduced the new chatbot in a livestreamed event Wednesday night but haven't published a technical explanation of its workings — known as a system card — that companies in the AI industry typically provide when introducing a new model.,"Musk's deliberate efforts to mold Grok into a challenger of what he considers the tech industry's “woke” orthodoxy on race, gender and politics has repeatedly got the chatbot into trouble, most recently when it spouted antisemitic tropes, praised Adolf Hitler and made other hateful commentary to users of Musk's X social media platform just days before Grok 4's launch.","""It seems that Musk’s effort to create a maximally truthful AI has somehow led to it believing its own values must align with Musk’s own values.” The lack of transparency is troubling for computer scientist Talia Ringer, a professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign who earlier in the week criticized the company's handling of the technology's antisemitic outbursts."
