The Letter of Award, initially disclosed on February 6, 2024, concerned a 300 MW solar project at a tariff of ₹2.53/kWh under the Flexibility Scheme, with ACME Sigma Urja Private Limited as the project SPV. The Flexibility Scheme, introduced on April 12, 2022, aimed to introduce flexibility in the generation and scheduling of thermal/hydro power stations by bundling with renewable and storage energy. ACME Solar stated the project is currently generating no revenue or profitability, resulting in no material impact on the Company's financial performance.","ACME Solar (Symbol: ACMESOLAR) announced it has received confirmation to exit a Letter of Award (LoA) without penalty, securing the return of its Earnest Money Deposit (EMD) for a 300 MW solar project.","The Letter of Award, initially disclosed on February 6, 2024, concerned a 300 MW solar project at a tariff of ₹2.53/kWh under the Flexibility Scheme, with ACME Sigma Urja Private Limited as the project SPV.","ACME Solar (Symbol: ACMESOLAR) announced it has received confirmation to exit a Letter of Award (LoA) without penalty, securing the return of its Earnest Money Deposit (EMD) for a 300 MW solar project.","The Letter of Award, initially disclosed on February 6, 2024, concerned a 300 MW solar project at a tariff of ₹2.53/kWh under the Flexibility Scheme, with ACME Sigma Urja Private Limited as the project SPV."
"Manappuram, IIFL Finance, other gold financier stocks rise up to 3% as precious metal hits lifetime high",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/manappuram-iifl-finance-other-gold-financier-stocks-rise-up-to-3-as-precious-metal-hits-lifetime-high-13510908.html,"Gold financier stocks extended gains on September 2, as the yellow metal continued to trade at lifetime high levels. Gold futures have crossed the key Rs 1.05 lakh per 10 grams-mark on MCX. The rising gold prices bodes well for gold financiers, as it increases the value of the collateral while issuing loans. This reduces the risk of default, as the collateral becomes more valuable relative to the loan amount issued against it. Manappuram Finance shares gained nearly 3 percent to trade at around Rs 282 apiece, nearing a record high level after extending gains for the second consecutive session. The stock has now gained more than 8 percent in two days. IIFL Finance shares gained nearly 2 percent to trade at Rs 447.50 apiece, also extending gains for the second day. Muthoot Finance shares meanwhile gained over 2 percent to hit an intraday high of Rs 2,768 apiece. Gold futures with October expiry on the MCX hit an all-time high of Rs 1,05,937 per 10 grams yesterday. The contracts are hovering near the record high level today. This comes amid heightened global uncertainties. A weaker dollar and growing expectations for a U.S. interest rate cut this month are supporting the rising gold prices, said Manav Modi, Analyst – Precious Metal -Research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services. Analyst expect the bull run in gold prices to continue. ""A softer US dollar and renewed safe-haven demand supported the rally, as investors turned to gold amid ongoing uncertainty surrounding US monetary policy. Growing political pressure may accelerate the timeline for interest rate cuts, with markets largely pricing in a 25 bps reduction in September—a development that remains supportive for bullion,"" said Axis Securities. Manav Modi from Motilal Oswal Financial Services also noted that the precious metals were up on safe-haven buying. ""Along with increasing rate cut expectations, tensions between Israel and Gaza and other geo-political tensions and the tariff escalations are continuously supporting buying in bullions, as increased expectations of a U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate cut this month lifted bullion's allure…Increase in festive and wedding demand, ETF buying and Increased premiums in China are some of the additional factors supporting gold’s bull run,"" he added.

Speaking to Fox News, Bessent said, ""I think at the end of the day, two great countries will get this solved."" He said the slow progress in India-US trade talks was one of the reasons behind US President Donald Trump-led US administration's decision to raise tariffs. He however criticised India's imports of Russian oil, which he said might be fueling Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine. ""The Indians have not been great actors in terms of buying Russian oil and then reselling it, financing the Russian war effort in Ukraine,"" he said. Speaking about Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit, Bessent said it is largely performative. ""I think at the end of the day, India is the most populous democracy in the world. Their values are much closer to ours and to China's than to Russia's,"" he added. Bessent's remarks may have spurred trade talk hopes between India and US, triggering a rally in the export-oriented textile and shrimp stocks. Gokaldas Exports shares jumped nearly 5 percent to trade at Rs 733 apiece, while KPR Mill shares surged nearly 3 percent. Raymond Lifestyle shares gained more than 3 percent, while Arvind Fashions sharers rose nearly 3 percent. Avanti Feeds shares rallied around 7 percent, while Apex Frozen Foods shares jumped more than 4 percent. Notably, these companies derive a major portion of their revenue from US exports. These stocks earlier tumbled after US increased its tariffs on Indian imports to a whopping 50 percent, the highest among its Asian peers. US President Donald Trump recently lashed out at India, calling the relationship between India and US ""a totally one-sided disaster"". In a post on Truth Social, Trump said, ""What few people understand is that we do very little business with India, but they do a tremendous amount of business with us. In other words, they sell us massive amounts of goods, their biggest “client,” but we sell them very little … They have now offered to cut their Tariffs to nothing, but it’s getting late. They should have done so years ago.""

"Phoenix Mills stock rallies 5% as Motilal Oswal upgrades to buy, sees 35% upside",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/phoenix-mills-stock-rallies-5-as-motilal-oswal-upgrades-to-buy-sees-35-upside-13510372.html,"Shares of mall operator and real estate player The Phoenix Mills rallied nearly five percent in trade on Tuesday, September 2, after domestic brokerage Motilal Oswal upgraded the counter to 'buy,' citing a strong growth outlook. The broking house upgraded its rating on the stock, while hiking its target price to Rs 2,044, which indicated a 35 percent upside from current levels. At 9.55 a.m., shares of the firm were quoting Rs 1,583.7, higher by 4.4 percent. During FY15-25, Phoenix Mills' retail portfolio witnessed an 11 percent CAGR in consumption, supported by ~7 percent like-for-like growth in the existing malls and the opening of new malls in Lucknow, Indore, Ahmedabad, Pune, and Bengaluru. Additionally, retail rental income clocked a similar 12 percent CAGR during this period, mirroring the consumption growth. Going ahead, Motilal Oswal anticipates this positive growth trend to continue, primarily driven by the ramp-up of new malls. The brokerage estimated a 21 percent CAGR in retail rental income over FY25-27E to reach Rs 2,800 crore by FY27E and total income to reach Rs 3,900 crore. While new malls continue to ramp up well, the firm is implementing measures to accelerate consumption at mature malls. These initiatives, along with a further increase in trading occupancy, will help Phoenix Mills sustain healthy traction in consumption. Further, the company continues to diversify and expand its office portfolio within its existing mall properties across key locations. Notable developments include office spaces at malls in Bengaluru (1.2msf), Chennai (0.4msf), and Palladium Mumbai (1.1msf). ""Additionally, newly launched malls in Pune (1.2msf) and Bengaluru (1.2msf) are also contributing to the growth of Phoenix Mills' office segment. These strategic expansions highlight the firm's commitment to increasing its office presence in high-demand urban areas,"" said Motilal Oswal. Motilal Oswal also said Phoenix Mills’ acquisition of the remaining 49 percent stake in Island Star Mall Developers (ISMDPL) will strengthen its premium retail portfolio and unlock long-term value. The deal is expected to be earnings-accretive from the first year, with further upside as rental income stabilizes and the 2.71 msf incremental FSI potential is developed over the medium term. Staggered payments over three years are likely to keep the net debt-to-equity ratio below 0.4x for the next two years.

"Sugar stocks rally up to 20% after govt allows ethanol production from sugarcane juice, molasses",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sugar-stocks-rally-up-to-12-after-govt-allows-ethanol-production-from-sugarcane-juice-molasses-13510529.html,"Sugar stocks surged in morning trade on September 2 after the government decided to remove limits on ethanol production from sugarcane juice, sugar syrup, and molasses for the year 2025-26. The government had restricted production of ethanol from sugarcane juice, syrup and all types of molasses in the current marketing year amid a drop in sugarcane supplies. In the new ethanol supply year starting from November 1, sugar mills and distilleries will be allowed to produce ethanol without any quantitative restriction, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution said. The Department of Food and Public Distribution (DFPD) will periodically review the sugar diversion to ethanol to ensure year-round domestic availability of the sweetener, it said. This comes as sugarcane supplies are expected to jump in the new season as ample monsoon rains for two straight years have helped farmers expand area under the crop. Balrampur Chini Mills shares jumped more than 7 percent to trade at Rs 580 apiece, while Shree Renuka Sugars shares rallied over 15 percent to trade at Rs 33 apiece. Bajaj Hindusthan Sugar and Godavari Biorefineries shares gained 12 percent and 5 percent respectively. Uttam Sugar Mills shares rallied over 9 percent, while Dhampur Sugar Mills and Magadh Sugar & Energy shares were trading around 10 percent higher. Triveni Engineering shares were up 4.5 percent, while Dwarikesh Sugar and other stocks gained up to 14 percent. Smallcap stock Rajshree Sugars & Chemicals meanwhile surged 20 percent to hit the upper circuit at Rs 45.26 apiece. Earlier yesterday, the Supreme Court dismissed a plea which challenged the nationwide rollout of 20 percent Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP-20). The petitioner had alleged that vehicles manufactured in India prior to April 2023 are not compatible with ethanol mix petrol. Vehicles as new as 2 years old are also not compatible with ethanol mixed petrol wherein the percentage of ethanol is 20 percent, despite the cars being BS-VI compliant, the person added. The plea, filed by advocate Akshay Malhotra, had sought a direction to the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas to ensure availability of ethanol-free petrol at all fuel stations. A bench headed by Chief Justice of India BR Gavai, along with Justice K Vinod Chandran, dismissed the plea. Attorney General R Venkataramani, opposing the petition, said that the matter had already been thoroughly examined before the policy’s rollout. He alleged that the petitioner was merely a “front” for a larger lobby and stressed that the policy benefits sugarcane farmers while also conserving foreign exchange. “Should people outside the country decide what fuel India should use?” the AG remarked.

"Sensex, Nifty to extend gains to second day? Key levels to track on September 2",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sensex-nifty-to-extend-gains-to-second-day-key-levels-to-track-on-september-2-13509759.html,"Indian benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty are likely to be on firm footing on September 2, extending the positive momentum from the start of the new month, powered by gains in IT and auto stocks. At around 7:22 am, GIFT Nifty quoted 24,767, up 0.16 percent, signaling a steady start for Dalal Street. The optimism stems from Monday’s broad-based buying, driven by India’s stronger-than-expected GDP growth in the first quarter. IT and auto counters were the star performers, while India VIX slipped 4 percent, hinting at improving market stability. However, flows remained divergent - Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) offloaded equities worth Rs 1,430 crore, even as Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) stepped in aggressively with net purchases of Rs 4,345 crore. On the technical front, Nifty has broken out of a falling wedge pattern—a classic bullish reversal signal. “As long as the index sustains above 24,540–24,500, the trend remains positive, with upside targets at 24,700–24,800 and possibly 24,900. A drop below 24,460 would be the first sign of weakness,” said Hariprasad K, SEBI-registered Research Analyst and Founder of Livelong Wealth. Global sentiment offered additional support. A US court declared most of President Trump’s tariffs illegal, though they will remain in effect until October 14 pending a Supreme Court review. Meanwhile, Asia-Pacific markets opened largely higher, as investors tracked developments at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) leaders’ meeting in Tianjin, even as tariff uncertainty lingered. Japan’s Nikkei 225 advanced 0.3 percent, South Korea’s Kospi gained 0.4 percent, while Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 slipped 0.4 percent. US markets were shut on Monday for the Labor Day holiday, and futures traded flat in early Asian hours at the start of what has historically been a challenging month for equities, especially amid renewed trade-related jitters following the court ruling.

"Asian stocks edge up, Japan bond auction in focus",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/asian-stocks-edge-up-japan-bond-auction-in-focus-13509720.html,"Asian stocks posted modest gains at the open Tuesday, with attention back on technology shares and the artificial intelligence sector following the surge in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s shares. Shares in Japan and South Korea rebounded after Monday’s losses while Australia’s declined. US equity-index futures edged lower after cash markets were closed Monday for Labor Day. West Texas Intermediate crude oil climbed in early trading and gold extended its gains to a sixth day, its longest winning streak since April 2024. Treasuries retreated in early trading with yield on the benchmark 10-year rising three basis points to 4.26%. Japan’s 10-year government bond auction Tuesday will be a key test of investor appetite amid growing expectations of rate hikes by the Bank of Japan and mounting political uncertainty. After a selloff in technology shares in Wall Street Friday, the record-breaking stock rally faces a pivotal test this month, with jobs numbers, inflation data and the Federal Reserve’s rate call all landing within the next three weeks. Tariff tensions and questions over the Fed’s independence are also compounding the risks in September, historically the weakest month of the year for US markets. “The bar to derail a Fed rate cut on Sept. 17 appears high,” Deutsche Bank AG economist Peter Sidorov wrote. “But with Fed funds futures now pricing over 140 basis points of easing by the end of 2026, markets are expecting an amount of easing that since the 1980s has only occurred around recessions.” A gauge tracking emerging-market equities notched its best session in a week amid thin liquidity due to the US holiday, boosted by AI-related stocks in Hong Kong and China. The MSCI EM Index closed 0.7% higher as Alibaba jumped 19% in Hong Kong — the most in three years — after the Chinese e-commerce giant reported a triple-digit percentage gain in AI-related product revenue as well as a better-than-anticipated 26% jump in sales from the cloud division. The rally marks a break from last week’s broader Asian market decline after a tech selloff hit Wall Street. Another key factor for the markets is the Cboe Volatility Index sitting at 16.12, not far off its 2025 closing low of 14.22. “The fact that investors are still betting heavily on new lows in volatility, even with VIX at what appears to be a floor, and with markets up sharply from their April lows to all-time highs, should be viewed with caution,” said Jeff Jacobson, a strategist at 22V Research, in a note Monday. Traders will also be closely monitoring Indonesian markets after stocks tumbled the most in nearly five months on Monday. Political risks have recently flared, with President Prabowo Subianto canceling a China trip after deadly unrest over living costs and inequality. Stress also was evident in the bond market, with yields on the nation’s 10-year government note rising to the highest in almost three weeks. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump said India offered to cut its tariff rates following the US imposition last week of 50% levies as punishment for its purchases of Russian oil. In Europe, bonds weakened broadly, with a week to go before a confidence vote that could topple France’s government. The French-German 10-year spread, a key measure of risk, was little changed at 79 basis points. The gauge closed at 82 on Aug. 27, the highest since January. Longer-maturity bonds may be in for a treacherous September, if history is any guide. Over the last decade, government bonds globally with maturities of over 10 years posted a median loss of 2% in September, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the worst monthly performance of the year.","Tariff tensions and questions over the Fed’s independence are also compounding the risks in September, historically the weakest month of the year for US markets.","“The fact that investors are still betting heavily on new lows in volatility, even with VIX at what appears to be a floor, and with markets up sharply from their April lows to all-time highs, should be viewed with caution,” said Jeff Jacobson, a strategist at 22V Research, in a note Monday.","Political risks have recently flared, with President Prabowo Subianto canceling a China trip after deadly unrest over living costs and inequality.","“But with Fed funds futures now pricing over 140 basis points of easing by the end of 2026, markets are expecting an amount of easing that since the 1980s has only occurred around recessions.” A gauge tracking emerging-market equities notched its best session in a week amid thin liquidity due to the US holiday, boosted by AI-related stocks in Hong Kong and China."

EMS companies have strong ties with Chinese component manufacturers. The earlier tensions between India and China following geopolitical disputes had impacted the stocks, as investors remained concerned over supply chain disruption. Prime Minister Narendra Modi attended the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Tianjin, China. At the summit, he met Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin. This holds strong significance in global geopolitics after US President Donald Trump's administration increased tariffs on Indian imports to a whopping 50 percent. Kaynes Technology shares gained nearly 8 percent to trade at Rs 6,595 apiece. The company imports most of its raw materials from outside, including various electronic components that are mostly sourced from China. The easing tensions between India and China after PM Modi's visit will likely boost the stock, on expectations of easing impact on supply chains. Dixon Technologies (India) shares jumped around 6 percent to close at Rs 17,625 apiece. Earlier this year, Dixon Technologies formed a joint venture with China's HKC to produce display modules by September 2025. The company is also exploring similar partnerships for precision components, mechanicals, camera modules, and battery packs. ""We have hired a senior resource and are building a team to execute these projects. The component PLI rollout by the government will strengthen our backward integration and open a massive market for Dixon,"" said Managing Director Atul Lall during the company’s Q3 earnings call. Notably, Dixon Tech in 2023 had announced a major partnership with Chinese smartphone brand Xiaomi, the Beijing-headquartered company which has faced heightened scrutiny over the years in India over souring ties with China. Amber Enterprises India shares meanwhile surged around 5 percent to end the session at 7,621.50. PG Electroplast shares rose over 4 percent to close at Rs 556 apiece.","Dixon Technologies (India) shares jumped around 6 percent to close at Rs 17,625 apiece.",The shares of Electronic Manufacturing Services (EMS) companies jumped on September 1 as Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to China boosted investor sentiment.,The shares of Electronic Manufacturing Services (EMS) companies jumped on September 1 as Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to China boosted investor sentiment.,"Notably, Dixon Tech in 2023 had announced a major partnership with Chinese smartphone brand Xiaomi, the Beijing-headquartered company which has faced heightened scrutiny over the years in India over souring ties with China."

"EV makers Ola, Ather’s shares soar on hopes of easier access to Chinese rare earth magnets, GST reform benefits",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/ev-makers-ola-ather-s-shares-soar-on-hopes-of-easier-access-to-chinese-rare-earth-magnets-gst-reform-benefits-13507047.html,"Shares of EV two-wheeler makers sharply surged on September 1, with Ola Electric and Ather Energy rising more than 14 percent each on positive outcome from the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in China, and the tailwind from proposed GST reforms that could drive sales. Ola Electric shares hit an intraday high of Rs 61.88 while Ather Energy shares hit an all-time high of Rs 512.80 apiece during the trade. PM Modi at SCO Summit Over the weekend, Prime Minister Modi met Chinese President Xi Jinping, at a time when India's automotive sector has been seeking further relaxation in Beijing's curbs on rare earths magnets, which have been in place since April, hampering EV makers' production plans. More than 50 Indian applications to import heavy rare earth magnets are awaiting approval in China, Bloomberg News had reported citing people familiar with the matter. China has, however, started lifting the restrictions on rare earth metals and critical minerals exports amid signs of a thaw in trade relations with China. While an official statement is still awaited, PM Modi's visit to China has likely boosted hopes for relaxation in export curbs, which will likely benefit EV-makers like Ola Electric and Ather Energy. GST Reforms Expectations The GST Council, chaired by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, is slated to meet in New Delhi on September 3-4 to deliberate on the Centre's proposal for a simplified two-rate structure of 5 percent and 18 percent. Market experts are attributing this to be a strong boost for several sectors, and autos, including EVs, are likely be benefitted from the reform. PLI push for Ola Electric Shares of Ola Electric Mobility have been extending gains after securing PLI certification from the Centre for its Gen 3 scooter portfolio. In an exchange filing on August 26, Ola Electric had said, ""(Ola Electric) has received Certification for Compliance with the eligibility assessment requirements under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for automobile and auto components sector, for its Gen 3 scooter portfolio. This certification was granted by the Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) under the aegis of the Ministry of Heavy Industries, Government of India to all of the seven Ola S1 Gen 3 scooters."" The EV-scooter maker said its Gen 2 and Gen 3 scooter portfolio are now PLI-certified. Its Gen 3 portfolio, which comprises S1 Pro 3 kWh, S1 Pro 4 kWh, S1 Pro+ 4 kWh, S1 X 2 kWh, S1 X 3 kWh, S1 X 4 kWh and S1 X+ 4 kWh, comprises majority of its current sales. As a result, this certification is set to significantly enhance its profitability from Q2FY26 onwards, the company said. Investor interest in the shares have revived after Helios Mutual Fund recently added Ola Electric to its portfolio, Dinshaw Irani, CEO of the fund house had told The Economic Times. Irani compared Ola to Eternal (Zomato), to showcase Helios' early bet in the food delivery giant played out. Helios had bought Zomato shares for around Rs 40 apiece, and the shares are currently trading at around Rs 320 apiece. Ola Electric shares are currently trading over 14 percent higher at Rs 61.62 apiece, having rallied over 56 percent from its 52-week low of Rs 39.60 apiece, hit in July this year. Ather Energy shares were trading around 12 percent higher after hitting an all-time high earlier in the session, and the shares have gained 69 percent since listing in May this year.

"From today, listed firms must provide granular disclosures for related party transactions",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/from-today-listed-firms-must-provide-granular-disclosures-for-related-party-transactions-13507239.html,"Starting today, nearly 5,000 listed companies will be required to follow a new set of rules issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) for approval of related party transactions (RPTs). The framework, which becomes effective September 1, is aimed at bringing greater transparency and equipping shareholders with more detailed information to make informed decisions. Related party transactions are business dealings between a company and entities that share a pre-existing relationship—such as subsidiaries, key management personnel, or major shareholders. These dealings often raise governance concerns if not adequately disclosed, as they may result in conflicts of interest or potential misuse of company resources. In June this year, Sebi directed listed entities to adopt minimum disclosure standards as prescribed by the Industry Standards Forum (ISF), a body comprising representatives from industry chambers like FICCI, CII, and ASSOCHAM, working in collaboration with the regulator and stock exchanges. These standards mandate that companies share detailed information with audit committees and shareholders before seeking approval for RPT proposals. Also read: Sebi panel recommends open offer process may be faster with quicker payout to investors Greater clarity and explanatory statements According to Makarand M Joshi, Founder of MMJC & Associates, “Explanatory statements for approving material RPTs need to be made more self-explanatory. It shall contain information, not only meeting but significantly exceeding the requirements of the Companies Act, 2013 viz. Data placed before audit committee, pricing methodology, certification from KMP, QR code for report of any etc.” He further noted that drafting such explanatory statements will now require far more diligence to enable better informed shareholder decision-making. The ISF-prescribed format specifies that management must present details of related parties’ shareholding or contribution to profit and loss of the listed entity or its subsidiary, both directly and indirectly. Likewise, shareholding of the related party in the listed entity must also be disclosed.In addition, information such as the financial performance of the related party, details of past transactions, and specifics of the proposed transaction—including nature, size, and rationale—must be clearly laid out. Wide coverage of transactions The new rules go beyond generic disclosures. For instance, transactions relating to loans, inter-corporate deposits, advances, or investments by the listed entity or its subsidiaries must now be accompanied by details of source of funds and rationale. Similarly, any proposed guarantee, indemnity, or comfort letter given by a company or subsidiary must be explained with the reasoning behind it. If transactions involve borrowings, sale, lease, or disposal of assets of subsidiaries or units, then audit committees must also be provided with bidding details and information about bidders.When it comes to royalty payments, the requirements are even more extensive. Companies will have to disclose the purpose of royalty paid during the last three years, break up payments made for brand use, technology know-how, professional or management fees, and compare royalty growth rates with growth in turnover, profit after tax, and dividends. Firms will also need to provide evidence of benefits derived from technology transfers and compare their royalty outgo with industry peers. Also read: Is Sebi revisiting F&O suitability? Recent remarks indicate entry criteria discussion is back on table and here's how it could look Sebi’s study on royalty payments Sebi had earlier conducted a comprehensive study of royalty payments across 233 listed companies between FY14 and FY23. The regulator found several instances where firms paid royalty to related parties exceeding 20% of their net profits. Alarmingly, even loss-making firms were making royalty pay-outs. The study revealed 1,538 instances of royalty payments falling below the 5% turnover approval threshold, while 185 cases involved loss-making companies paying a cumulative Rs 1,355 crore as royalty. Sebi observed that such practices raised questions on governance and shareholder value. Certification to protect shareholders Under the new framework, companies must also provide certifications from the CEO, CFO, or other key managerial personnel, and from every promoter-director, confirming that the proposed RPTs are not prejudicial to public shareholders. If any promoter-director fails to provide such certification, the fact must be disclosed to the audit committee and shareholders before approval.Pavan Vijay, Founder, Corporate Professionals says, “The RPT Industry Standards enhance investor confidence by ensuring greater transparency and comparability in related party disclosures at the time of approval. Investors can now better assess the fairness of transactions involving promoters or key stakeholders, identify governance lapses and benchmark disclosures across companies and industries”. He further says, “Professionals should ensure consistency with the structured format specified in Para 4 of the RPT Industry Standards, clearly disclose transaction terms, avoid vague or incomplete information and provide valuation or other external reports to the Audit Committee and shareholders (through a QR code or web-link), among other requirements”. Anjali Malhotra, Partner- Regulatory, Nangia Andersen LLP says, ""The requirement to have standardized formats for approval of RPT’s emerged due to precedents wherein funds were diverted through related parties for personal use and information was camouflaged which could have enabled the audit committee o or shareholders to judiciously accord their approvals. The historic examples depict how gaps in transparency can disrupt stakeholders trust, threat business continuity and invite regulatory actions"". Transparency and compliance The regulator had initially set July 1, 2025, as the effective date for the circular. However, based on industry feedback, the implementation was deferred to September 1 to allow companies more time to align their systems and processes. With the new rules now coming into force, experts believe Indian capital markets are poised to see stronger governance practices.

""But, it cannot be ignored that, except for the indecisive day on August 25th, the declines so far have been large, raising the possibility of a mean reversion move higher. For this to materialise, a quick swing back above 24350, in the event of a first half collapse, or a push above 24550-608 band needs to be seen,"" he added.

Chalasani, Group CEO of Suzlon Energy (SUEL), for an expert session on the wind industry. Mr. Chalasani has reiterated his long-term commitment to SUEL, highlighting that his position as CEO carries no defined sunset clause. He noted that an approved list of models and manufacturers (ALMM) in wind turbine generator (WTG) manufacturing is likely the first step toward reducing India’s import dependence, with the government possibly extending localization mandates further in the coming years. He believes that foreign OEMs’ transition to building domestically may entail multiple complex and time-consuming challenges. However, more details about the localization order are still awaited and can add to the complexity of indigenization. Outlook Overall, we continue to believe SUEL remains well-placed to benefit from favorable policy tailwinds, localized supply chain advantages, in-house R&D, and execution readiness vs. global and domestic peers. We reiterate our BUY rating on SUEL with a target price of INR 80.

"BSE, MCX, other capital market stocks jump up to 5%: Here are possible reasons behind sharp rally",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/bse-mcx-other-capital-market-stocks-jump-up-to-5-key-reasons-behind-sharp-rally-13506512.html,"The shares of capital market stocks surged on September 1 amid a broader uptrend in the markets. The sharp rise in the share prices pushed the Nifty Capital Markets index up around 2.5 percent to snap a four-day losing streak. Nifty Capital Markets index was trading in the deep green at around 4,193 in the morning trading hours of Monday, after closing in the red for the entire holiday-shortened last week. Here are some of the key reasons behind the sharp rise in the capital market stocks: Markets in green: After three consecutive sessions of closing in the red, benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty were trading in green as strong GDP numbers and other key factors boosted investor sentiment. Sensex gained over 300 points (0.4 percent) to hover near 80,100, while Nifty 50 rose over 100 points (0.4 percent) to reclaim the 24,500-mark. The optimism in the stock markets could have provided a boost to the capital market stocks. Rising gold, silver prices: Gold and silver prices have been rallying over the past couple of sessions, as rising global uncertainties polished the safe-have appeal of the precious metals. Gold’s future contracts with October expiry on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) hit a fresh all-time high of Rs 1,05,937 per 10 grams today. Silver futures with December expiry were also at a lifetime high level of Rs 1,24,470 per kilogram on MCX. The sharp rise in the metal futures may have boosted the share price on MCX, which is up around 5 percent. ""Along with increasing rate cut expectations, tensions between Israel and Gaza and other geo-political tensions and the tariff escalations are continuously supporting buying in bullions, as increased expectations of a U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate cut this month lifted bullion's allure. U.S. consumer spending increased solidly in July while underlying inflation picked up as tariffs on imports raised prices of some goods, but that data will probably not prevent the Fed from cutting interest rates this month...Increase in festive and wedding demand, ETF buying and increased premiums in China are some of the additional factors supporting gold's bull run,"" said Manav Modi, Analyst of Precious Metal - Research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services. NSE revises quantity freeze limits for index derivatives: Effective from today, NSE has revised the quantity freeze limits for index derivatives contracts. As per the revised framework, the applicable freeze limits for key indices will be: Bank Nifty at 900, Nifty 50 at 1,800, Finnifty at 1,800, Nifty Midcap Select at 2,800, and Nifty Next 50 at 600. Under the earlier circular effective July 1, the limit was lower for Bank Nifty at 600. The latest revision effectively increases the permissible order size for Bank Nifty futures and options, while retaining the freeze limits for other contracts. Quantity freeze limits act as a safeguard to prevent erroneous or abnormally large orders that could disrupt market stability. By increasing the ceiling, NSE can see some larger trades being placed in the stock market. This may have had an impact on the capital market stocks today. Value buying: The capital market stocks have seen strong downturn in the recent days, tracking the overall the downturn in the stock markets. After a four-day fall, investors may have now resorted to value buying. The stocks see heavy volumes today, with nearly 3 lakh shares of Anand Rathi being involved in active trade in just two hours into the session. This is around 3 times that of its 10-day average volumes. MCX and Anand Rathi Wealth shares gained around 5 percent each to trade at Rs 7,754 apiece and Rs 2,929 apiece respectively. The shares of Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and KFin Tech shares jumped nearly 4 percent each. Motilal Oswal Financial Services shares rose over 3 percent, while Central Depository Services (CDSL) and CAMS shares were up over 2 percent each. NAM India, Angel One and Indian Energy Exchange (IEX) shares were up around 2 percent each, while UTI AMC, 360 One WAM, HDFC AMC and Nuvama shares were up around 1 percent each.

The next leg of growth is expected from building simple, scalable and secure platforms for MSMEs and enterprises. In addition to the earlier announced Jio AI Cloud, the company announced two new features this AGM- Jio PC and Jio Frames. The first enables converting any TV or screen into AI-ready computer by plugging a keyboard into Jio Set-Top Box. The latter is an AI powered wearable platform and ecosystem and enables clicking photos and recording videos. It aims to list Jio in H1CY26 subject to necessary approvals. Outlook The company has successfully demonstrated its ability to execute large scale unrelated diversifications through its foray into retail as well as digital services in the past. Since 2021, it has been working on its New Energy segment where it has also partnered with several technology companies. In absence of further details, we have valued its New Energy segment at 2x its stated capex of Rs 750bn, valuing it at Rs111/share. However, New Energy segment faces 1) overcapacity and ability of the Chinese to crash prices, 2) rapid changes in technologies, 3) tight control of Chinese over the supply-chain, and 4) lack of ecosystem in the country. We have also highlighted in our thematic note the difficulties faced by non-Chinese companies in this segment, which has seen ten large size bankruptcies in 2024 alone. We use SOTP to value the company at Rs 1,555 (unchanged). The stock has corrected by 7% since our last note. Due to the same, we upgrade the stock to BUY from Accumulate.

JB has leading brands in the chronic space. Six of JB’s brands are in the top 300 of the Indian pharmaceutical market (IPM) and continue to perform well on account of proven efficacy and favourable patient outcomes. JB is also strong in nephro, IV, pediatrics, ophthalmology and other segments. The ophthalmology segment (currently under a distribution model) will move into a licensing phase in January 2027, thus boosting margins.

JKCE has a rather cogent roadmap to achieve its 50mtpa target by 2030. First off, it recently announced a 7mtpa project in Jaisalmer which, in conjunction with projects in-hand, should catapult capacity to 38mtpa by Q2FY28 (24mtpa in FY25). Complementing this, the low-hanging brownfield expansion potential (to add 12mtpa) shall make the remaining job that much easier while increased cashflow may support project execution simultaneously. This setting is reminiscent of Shree Cement (SRCM), which in its high-growth years (FY14–18) commanded premium valuation of an average 22x EV/EBITDA. Outlook JKCE is set to tread a robust growth path with low-cost expansions guarding its industry-superior RoE along the way. Jaisalmer’s greenfield project is pegged to cost a mere USD 78/t (special incentive package to boost returns further); other brownfield expansions should cost USD 60/t. The clear path to high-quality growth is reminiscent of SRCM, which in its high-growth years commanded a valuation multiple of 22x EV/EBITDA. Drawing confidence from JKCE’s proven project execution prowess, its robust volume ramp-up, and disciplined approach to leverage, we now value the stock at 22x FY27E EV/EBITDA (being SRCM’s FY14–18 average).

"Sensex gains 555 pts, Nifty above 24,600: Upbeat Q1 GDP data among key factors behind market rise",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sensex-gains-300-pts-nifty-reclaims-24-500-strong-q1-gdp-data-among-key-factors-behind-market-rally-13506106.html,"Benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty took a breather on September 1, closing in green after three consecutive sessions of recording losses. Sensex gained nearly 555 points (over 0.7 percent) to end the session at 80,364.49, while Nifty 50 rose nearly 200 points (over 0.8 percent) to close above the 24,600-mark. The broader market indices also recorded strong gains, with the smallcap and midcap indices rising up to 2 percent. Most of the major sectoral indices, expect media and pharma, were trading in the green. Here are the key factors behind the uptrend in Indian stock markets today: Strong Q1 GDP numbers: Indian economy grew 7.8 percent in the April-June quarter of the ongoing financial year. This is the highest growth recorded in five consecutive quarters, beating economists' estimates. Gross domestic product (GDP) topped both the RBI's 6.5 percent projection and the 6.6 percent median recorded in a Moneycontrol poll. The GDP growth was also stronger than the 7.4 percent rate recorded in the preceding three months (Q4 FY25) and 6.5 percent recorded a year earlier (Q1 FY25). ""The key driver for this upbeat opening is India’s strong GDP data, which has boosted investor confidence and supported sentiment across sectors. Backed by healthy economic momentum and stable global cues, the market is set to begin on a firm note, though moves may turn stock-specific as the day progresses,"" said Mandar Bhojane, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst - Research at Choice Equity Broking Private Limited. Optimism over PM Modi attending SCO Summit in China: Prime Minister Narendra Modi attended the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Tianjin, China. At the summit, he has met Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin. This holds strong significance in global geopolitics after US President Donald Trump's administration increased tariffs on Indian imports to a whopping 50 percent. Additionally, the cooling tensions between India and China also may have boosted the markets. ""Global geopolitics is transforming fast in response to Trump’s tantrums. The coming together of China, India and Russia can have profound consequences on global power equations and thereby on global trade. This will have its impact on the stock market too,"" said VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited. Strong auto sales: Several automakers like Maruti Suzuki, Bajaj Auto, Hyundai and others released strong sales data for the month of August, beating expectations. This boosted the stocks, and the overall index as well. The sharp rise in the share prices pushed the Nifty Auto index up nearly 3 percent to close at 25,660. US court rules Trump tariffs illegal: A US appeals court last week ruled that most of Donald Trump's tariffs are illegal. The court has allowed the tariffs to remain effective till October 14, giving the Trump administration time to file an appeal with the US Supreme Court. Trump has GST Council, saying, ""If these Tariffs ever went away, it would be a total disaster for the Country."" The court ruling may have also provided some relief to the Indian stock markets, which earlier fell sharply after the additional tariffs took effect. VK Vijayakumar noted that the US court ruling on Trump's tariffs is a big development, and investors will await the final verdict by the US Supreme Court on the issue. Value buying: After three days of fall, investors may have resorted to value buying now. Sensex dropped more than 1,800 points (over 2 percent) to fall below the 80,000 mark, while Nifty 50 fell 541 points (over 2 percent) to fall below the 24,500-mark between August 26 and August 29. ""The Nifty 50 is trading below its 100-DEMA, showing a weak trend with risks of further downside if 24,350 breaks. Key supports are at 24,350 and 24,150, while resistance lies at 24,600–24,800. Traders are advised to stay cautious, avoid aggressive positions, and consider buying near 24,350 with a stop-loss at 24,280 and profit booking around 24,700–24,800,"" said Mandar Bhojane, while explaining the technical side of the benchmark index. India Vix, which measures volatility in the markets, also dropped nearly 4 percent to 11.29 on September 1. IT stocks lead gains: IT stocks rose 1.3 percent after data showed the US Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) rose in line with estimates, keeping alive the expectations of a rate cut in September. The Federal Reserve tracks the PCE price measures for its 2 percent inflation target. Lower interest rates in the US make emerging markets such as India more attractive for foreign investors. All 10 constituents of the Nifty IT index traded in positive territory, with Mphasis leading the pack. The surge followed Morgan Stanley’s overweight rating on the stock, along with a revised target price of Rs 3,625 per share, up from Rs 3,500 earlier. GST reforms expectations: The GST Council, chaired by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, is slated to meet in New Delhi on September 3-4 to deliberate on the Centre's proposal for a simplified two-rate structure of 5 percent and 18 percent. According to market experts, this will likely act as a strong boost for several sectors. ""The proposed GST reforms can accelerate growth in the coming quarters. This, along with the huge liquidity coming into mutual funds will continue to support the market,"" VK Vijayakumar said.

"Sterlite Tech shares lower after US court affirms $96.5 million order in non-compete breach, company plans to appeal",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sterlite-tech-shares-lower-after-us-court-affirms-96-5-million-order-in-non-compete-breach-company-plans-to-appeal-13506167.html,"Optical fiber cables company Sterlite Tech's shares were sharply lower in early trade on September 1, down by over 3 percent, after an exchange filing said an American company - Prysmian Cables - has filed a lawsuit against STL's US subsidiary over breach of non-compete and confidentiality agreements. Prysmian Cables and Systems USA, LLC sued the company and Stephen Szymanski, an employee of Sterlite Tech Inc over violation of 'certain non-compete and confidentiality agreements', which have provided Sterlite Tech with an 'alleged unjust competitive advantage', an exchange filing said. Sterlite Tech has denied these allegations, and said the company is 'not a party to this dispute and no claims have been made against STL'. A South Carolina jury had awarded $200,000 against Szymanski and $96.5 million against Sterlite Tech, and the Court affirmed the verdict on August 29, 2025, but denied pre-judgment interest. A pre-judgment interest refers to any compensation to the winning side in a lawsuit for the loss of the use of money between the date of the final judgment, and the claim becoming due. ""On August 9, 2024, following a three week trial, a Jury returned a verdict of $200,000 against Szymanski and USD 96.5 million against STI. On August 29, 2025, the Court affirmed the verdict but denied Plaintiff’s post-trial motion for pre-judgment interest,"" the company informed. Sterlite Tech has disputed the ruling and intends to appeal the verdict. The judgment is 'unsupported by the testimony and evidence presented at trial' said Sterlite Tech. The company intends to 'vigorously pursue all available post-trial remedies, including an appeal', the statement said. ""Matter is sub-judice and given STI intends to file an appeal, the ultimate financial implications, if any, will be assessed on the ultimate resolution of the matter,"" Sterlite Tech added. Having recovered from early lows, the shares of Sterlite Tech are sharply down in the trading session. On a YTD basis, shares of STL are down by over 4 percent, and lower by 16 percent over past one year.",Sterlite Tech has disputed the ruling and intends to appeal the verdict.,"Optical fiber cables company Sterlite Tech's shares were sharply lower in early trade on September 1, down by over 3 percent, after an exchange filing said an American company - Prysmian Cables - has filed a lawsuit against STL's US subsidiary over breach of non-compete and confidentiality agreements.","Optical fiber cables company Sterlite Tech's shares were sharply lower in early trade on September 1, down by over 3 percent, after an exchange filing said an American company - Prysmian Cables - has filed a lawsuit against STL's US subsidiary over breach of non-compete and confidentiality agreements.","A pre-judgment interest refers to any compensation to the winning side in a lawsuit for the loss of the use of money between the date of the final judgment, and the claim becoming due."
