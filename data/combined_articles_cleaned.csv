"Auto, metal, real estate stocks drop up to 2% on Trump tariff worries",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/auto-metal-realty-stocks-drop-up-to-2-after-us-issues-notice-to-impose-extra-25-tariff-on-india-from-tomorrow-13488281.html,"The shares of auto, metal and real estate companies dropped in trade on August 26, after Donald Trump-led US administration issued a draft order over the implementation of additional 25 percent tariff on Indian imports, effectively from August 27 (Wednesday). The sharp drop in the share prices pushed the sectoral indices, as well as the overall market, down. Nifty Metal and Nifty Realty indices fell more than 1.2 percent and nearly 1.6 percent to hover around 9,319 and 902 respectively. Nifty Auto meanwhile was down over 0.6 percent in the morning. According to a draft notice released by US Department of Homeland Security, the additional tariffs will cover Indian products ""that are entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on August 27, 2025"". The notice cited ""threats to the United States by the Government of the Russian Federation"" as the reason for President Donald Trump's executive order dated August 6. The ties between New Delhi and Washington soured after Trump announced that he will hike the tariffs on Indian goods to 50 percent, allegedly in response to New Delhi's continued purchases of Russian oil and defence equipment. Top losers on metal index: Several metal companies have strong export exposure to the US, and will likely be impacted by Trump's tariffs. On the metal index, Adani Enterprises shares were the top loser, dropping more than 2 percent to trade at Rs 2,253 apiece. Welspun Corp, Steel Authority of India (SAIL) and Tata Steel shares fell nearly 2 percent each. Hindalco Industries, National Aluminium Company (NALCO), Hindustan Copper, NMDC and JSW Steel shares fell more than 1 percent each, while Vedanta and Hindustan Zinc shares were down nearly 1 percent. Jindal Stainless Steel shares were trading in the red with marginal losses. Top losers on realty index: While real estate companies are mostly domestic market-oriented, Trump tariffs can inflate the cost of raw materials associated with the industry, which in turn may put pressure on the margins of these companies. On the realty index, heavyweight DLF was the top loser, dropping more than 2 percent to trade at Rs 755 apiece. Macrotech Developers (Lodha), Godrej Properties, Sobha and Oberoi Realty shares fell nearly 2 percent each. Prestige Estates, Raymond, Anant Raj, Phoenix and Brigade Enterprises shares fell around 1 percent each. Top losers on auto index: Several automakers and auto-parts makers derive major portion of their revenue from exports to US. While some auto and auto parts exports are exempt from the latest tariff change, the overall impact on the industry and uncertain trade rules may have pushed the stocks down. Samvardhana Motherson and Bharat Forge shares dropped more than 2 percent, leading losses on the auto index. Balkrishna Industries, MRF and Tube Investments of India shares fell around 1.5 percent each. TVS Motor, Ashok Leyland, Bosch and Maruti Suzuki shares were down up to 1 percent.

Vodafone Idea shares slumps 9% after govt clarifies no fresh discussion on AGR relief,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/vodafone-idea-shares-slumps-6-percent-after-government-clarifies-no-fresh-discussion-on-adr-relief-13488132.html,"Shares of Vodafone Idea is witnessing a serious bout of profit booking, down over 9 percent in early trade on August 26, taking Indus Towers' shares along with it, as investors likely offloaded positions after clarification from the Telecom Ministry on the company's AGR dues. Minister of State for Communications Pemmasani Chandra Sekhar had told Moneycontrol on August 25 that there is no plan under consideration to extend further relief other than what has been already extended. “...we have recently converted a lot of their debt into equity. Government has done whatever we thought we could do and at this time we don’t have any discussion or plan to change other than what we have done,” the minister said. Any additional relief for Vodafone Idea (Vi) on its adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues will be decided collectively by the Union Cabinet, involving the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), Finance Ministry, Telecom Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia and the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), the minister added. Shares of Indus Tower are down 3.5 percent in early trade on August 26, but are flat on a YTD basis. Shares of Vodafone Idea are down over 15 percent on a YTD basis. Last week, a news report had suggested that the DoT has proposed “multiple relief options” to the PMO, including a fresh two-year moratorium on AGR payments, smaller annual instalments, and waivers on penalties and interest. Asked if the PMO had received a proposal from DoT on extending relief to the operator, Sekhar replied: “not that we know of.” On the question of survival, the minister responded, “That is not up to me to decide… every company, all the companies, are continuously reaching out for various reasons, they will also be continuously reaching. But at this time, the discussion — there is nothing that we have planned.” Vi had previously urged DoT to treat the Rs 17,213 crore (principal calculated till FY19) as final, and waive off the entire interest and penalty on AGR dues. Akshaya Moondra, the CEO of Vodafone Idea had told analysts during an investor call earlier this month that the company is entirely focusing on investing in the business. ""...whatever capital is available to the Company, the focus is not in trying to do anything with the government holding. The focus will be in using any funding and cash generation for investments, which will give the best returns for the business."" The telecom player is engaged with banks for funding, which have started moving forward. The banks are currently looking for some clarity on the AGR front, Voda Idea has said, hence the company is engaged with the government. ""In the past, we have always seen that government has been supportive. You look at 2019 deferment of spectrum instalments, 2021 Reforms Package, 2023 conversion of government dues to equity, 2025 again, conversion of government dues to equity. Generally, these actions have happened. Generally, they happen closer to the time when it is essentially needed. Our request to the government has been that let us resolve this earlier than before the deadline of March, so thatbanks get clarity and we can proceed with bank funding,"" Akshaya Moondra had told investors during the June quarter earnings call.","Government has done whatever we thought we could do and at this time we don’t have any discussion or plan to change other than what we have done,” the minister said.","Asked if the PMO had received a proposal from DoT on extending relief to the operator, Sekhar replied: “not that we know of.” On the question of survival, the minister responded, “That is not up to me to decide… every company, all the companies, are continuously reaching out for various reasons, they will also be continuously reaching.",Minister of State for Communications Pemmasani Chandra Sekhar had told Moneycontrol on August 25 that there is no plan under consideration to extend further relief other than what has been already extended.,"Asked if the PMO had received a proposal from DoT on extending relief to the operator, Sekhar replied: “not that we know of.” On the question of survival, the minister responded, “That is not up to me to decide… every company, all the companies, are continuously reaching out for various reasons, they will also be continuously reaching."

Bank, metal and pharma stocks were major laggards while the mid and smallcaps also mirrored weak trends in early trade. At 10:40 am, the Sensex was down 612.85 points or 0.75 percent at 81,023.06, and the Nifty was down 182.50 points or 0.73 percent at 24,785.25. About 1,028 shares advanced, 2,344 shares declined, and 133 shares were unchanged. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Earlier this month, Trump said the US would raise tariffs on Indian goods to 50 percent from 25 percent, citing New Delhi’s purchases of Russian oil. The move is intended to curb India’s energy trade with Moscow and increase pressure on Russia to halt its war in Ukraine. ""Despite muted earnings growth and challenges such as high tariffs, Indian equities have held firm, making the market the most expensive globally. While foreign investors have remained steady sellers, strong domestic institutional inflows have more than offset the outflows, keeping sentiment buoyant. With liquidity emerging as the key driver of this resilience—and flows expected to stay strong—analysts believe a sharp correction is unlikely, and elevated valuations could persist,"" V K Vijayakumar of Geojit Investments Ltd said. Among individual stocks, Sai Life Sciences slipped as much as 4 percent after private equity firm TPG Asia offloaded its entire 15.2 percent holding in the Hyderabad-based CRDMO through block deals, CNBC TV-18 reported. The sale, estimated at nearly Rs 2,810 crore, involves about 3.16 crore shares and carries a floor price of Rs 874 per share, roughly at a 3.5 percent discount from the previous close of Rs 906 per share. Titan shares slipped due to a weak market mood even as Bernstein initiated coverage with an “outperform” rating and a target price of Rs 4,200, citing the company’s strong positioning to benefit from rising formalisation and evolving consumer preferences in India. The brokerage highlighted Titan’s track record of delivering a 23 percent EPS CAGR over the past two decades and noted that the stock is trading at a five-year low valuation. Reliance Industries shares were in focus after UBS resumed coverage on the stock with a “buy” call and a price target of Rs 1,750, implying a 24 percent upside from Monday’s close. The brokerage said RIL is well placed for a re-rating on the back of its value-unlocking prospects and described the conglomerate as a key player shaping India’s digital and new energy future. Technical View With Nifty failing to display directional strength, the index now clings to its crucial support at 24,800. The broader setup between the swing high of 25,150 and swing low of 24,850 indicates limited upside and a prolonged consolidation phase. Renewed call writing at higher strikes, coupled with sustained put additions at similar levels, further validates the sideways structure. Unless the index decisively clears 25,150, upward momentum is likely to remain capped. On the downside, sustaining above 24,800 is critical to prevent deeper corrections. For now, a “sell on rise” approach appears prudent, with traders awaiting a clear breakout above 25,100 or a breakdown below 24,800 for the next directional move. Ahead of the key tariff announcement on the 27th, the market is likely to witness sideways-to-volatile sessions. HUL, Bajaj Auto, TCS and Infosys were the top gainers on the Nifty. Laggards on the index included Tata Steel, Dr Reddy's, ICICI Bank, Bharat Electronics, and Hindalco.

"Sensex, Nifty set for a weak start as Trump signals 50% tariffs; key levels to track on August 26",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sensex-nifty-set-for-a-weak-start-as-trump-signals-50-tariffs-key-levels-to-track-on-august-26-13487667.html,"Indian equities are set for a cautious start on Tuesday, August 26, after a draft notice revealed US President Donald Trump’s plan to slap 50 percent tariffs on Indian goods. At 8:15 am, the Gift Nifty was quoting at 24,916, down 71 points or 0.31 percent, signalling a weak open for the Sensex and Nifty. Earlier this month, Trump said the US would raise tariffs on Indian goods to 50 percent from 25 percent, citing New Delhi’s purchases of Russian oil. The move is intended to curb India’s energy trade with Moscow and increase pressure on Russia to halt its war in Ukraine. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Equity benchmarks Nifty 50 and Sensex recorded some gains, kicking off the holiday-truncated trading week on a positive note on Monday, August 25. Dovish signals from the U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell raised hopes of a rate cut, fuelling investor optimism across the globe. Here are the important levels to watch out for in today's session With Nifty failing to display directional strength, the index now clings to its crucial support at 24,800. The broader setup between the swing high of 25,150 and swing low of 24,850 indicates limited upside and a prolonged consolidation phase. Renewed call writing at higher strikes, coupled with sustained put additions at similar levels, further validates the sideways structure. Unless the index decisively clears 25,150, upward momentum is likely to remain capped. On the downside, sustaining above 24,800 is critical to prevent deeper corrections. For now, a “sell on rise” approach appears prudent, with traders awaiting a clear breakout above 25,100 or a breakdown below 24,800 for the next directional move. Ahead of the key tariff announcement on the 27th, the market is likely to witness sideways-to-volatile sessions. ""On the daily chart, the Nifty Bank index remains below all key moving averages except the 200-day moving average, highlighting that recovery attempts are being capped at higher levels. The index continues to hover close to the recent swing low of 54,905, which is acting as immediate support. A breakdown below this zone could drag the index further toward 54,600, which coincides with the 127.8 percent Fibonacci extension,"" Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities said. ""The broader trend remains fragile as long as the index stays below its short-term averages. Support is placed at 54,900, followed by 54,600, while resistance stays firm at 55,500–55,600. Until the index crosses above these hurdles, short-term moves may remain choppy with risks tilted toward the downside,"" he added. The India VIX settled at 11.76; however, crossing above 12.50 could lead to higher volatility in the coming sessions. The Put-Call Ratio (PCR) dipped further from 0.52 to 0.50, highlighting call-side dominance and supply pressure. At the same time, the oversold PCR also leaves room for a short-term relief pullback. The increasing PCR, or being higher than 0.7 or surpassing 1, means traders are selling more Put options than Call options, which generally indicates the firming up of a bullish sentiment in the market.

"GSK re-enters India’s oncology market with Jemperli and Zejula, unveils tiered pricing and patient support program",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/gsk-re-enters-india-s-oncology-market-with-jemperli-and-zejula-unveils-tiered-pricing-and-patient-support-program-13485879.html,"GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) has re-entered India’s oncology market with the launch of two precision therapies—Jemperli (dostarlimab) and Zejula (niraparib)—targeting advanced endometrial and ovarian cancers, respectively. The move marks GSK’s return to the cancer care segment nearly a decade after divesting its global oncology portfolio to Novartis. Speaking at a media interaction in Mumbai, Bhushan Akshikar, Managing Director of GSK India, said the company is committed to making these therapies accessible through a tiered pricing strategy and a comprehensive patient support program branded Phoenix. The tiered pricing refers to different prices for the same drug in different markets, based on factors like a country's economic status or a patient's ability to pay. “We’ve always kept the Indian patient at the core of our pricing decisions. These therapies will be comparatively priced and supported by fewer treatment cycles, which reduces overall cost burden,” Akshikar said. Akshikar declined to provide pricing details of the drugs, especially Jemperli, but said they are ""competitively"" priced compared to existing therapy. Jemperli, India’s first approved PD-1 immunotherapy for second-line treatment of mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR) advanced endometrial cancer, requires 11 infusion cycles—significantly fewer than competing immunotherapies, which typically require 17–18 cycles. PD-1 drugs are immunotherapies that help the body fight cancer by blocking the PD-1 protein, which normally prevents immune cells from attacking tumors. Jemperli competes against other PD-1s, including top sellers like Merck’s Keytruda and BMS’s Opdivo known for their broad use across many cancers and proven survival benefits. Zejula, a once-daily oral PARP inhibitor, is approved as first-line maintenance therapy for advanced ovarian cancer, regardless of biomarker status. Expanding access To further improve affordability and access, GSK’s patient support programme called Phoenix will offer financial assistance, diagnostic support, and counseling services. The company is also evaluating EMI-based payment options and biomarker testing coupons to help patients navigate the high cost of precision therapies. “This is not just about pricing—it’s about building a 360-degree support ecosystem for cancer patients,” said Dr. Shalini Menon, EVP – Medical Affairs, GSK India. “We’re addressing diagnostic gaps and ensuring timely access to treatment.” The launches are backed by global clinical data from the GARNET (Jemperli) and PRIMA (Zejula) trials, and approvals across 40+ countries. GSK is also conducting trials in India to expand indications for dostarlimab to lung, colorectal, and head-and-neck cancers. GSK’s oncology strategy is part of a broader transformation to build a specialty and super-specialty portfolio in India. “We’re starting from zero in oncology, but the potential is significant,” Akshikar said. ""I think if you open up indications one by one, each of these indications would be worth 700 crores in terms of the sheer number of patients that we have in this country."" The company has built a specialized oncology team with over 300 years of cumulative experience and is investing in clinical trials and real-world evidence generation to accelerate future launches. Rising gynaecological cancers Endometrial cancer is a malignancy arising out of the endometrium, the inner lining of the uterus. Nearly a fourth of endometrial cancer patients in India are at an advanced stage. At this stage, chemotherapy remains a standard treatment but it is often associated with toxicity and poor long-term outcomes. According to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) – National Cancer Registry Programme (NCRP), the estimated annual incidence in India is around 19,000 to 20,000 new cases per year for Endometrial cancer and 48,000 new cases annually for ovarian cancer. Endometrial and ovarian cancers are among the top three gynaecological cancers in India. By 2045, the incidence of endometrial and ovarian cancer in India is projected to increase by 78% and 69% respectively.",Endometrial and ovarian cancers are among the top three gynaecological cancers in India.,"According to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) – National Cancer Registry Programme (NCRP), the estimated annual incidence in India is around 19,000 to 20,000 new cases per year for Endometrial cancer and 48,000 new cases annually for ovarian cancer.","Jemperli, India’s first approved PD-1 immunotherapy for second-line treatment of mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR) advanced endometrial cancer, requires 11 infusion cycles—significantly fewer than competing immunotherapies, which typically require 17–18 cycles.","According to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) – National Cancer Registry Programme (NCRP), the estimated annual incidence in India is around 19,000 to 20,000 new cases per year for Endometrial cancer and 48,000 new cases annually for ovarian cancer."

The index pulled back from the highs of the day, and at close, the Sensex closed up 329.06 points or 0.40 percent at 81,635.91, while the Nifty 50 was up 97.65 points or 0.39 percent at 24,967.75.

Click to View More Outlook for August 26 Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets started the week on a positive note, gaining nearly half a percent on the back of favorable global cues. After an initial uptick, the Nifty slipped in early trade but recovered as strong buying in IT majors and resilience in heavyweights across other sectors lifted the index higher. As a result, the Nifty 50 ended near 24,967.75, up around 0.4%. In contrast, the broader markets remained subdued, closing almost flat, reflecting a cautious undertone. Investor sentiment was buoyed by easing global rate concerns, with comments from the U.S. Federal Reserve hinting at a possible rate cut next month, boosting risk appetite across emerging markets. On the domestic front, steady institutional inflows and softening crude oil prices provided additional support. From a technical perspective, the Nifty faces immediate resistance at the 25,150 level; a breakout above this could open the door for further gains. Traders should closely track IT, metals, and realty stocks, while financials are likely to set the tone for the next session. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The Indian equities remained strong, tracking global cues, as the dovish speech by Fed Chair Jerome Powell boosted risk-on sentiment. However, the Nifty fell short of the 25,000 mark, closing slightly below it. The sentiment remains positive as long as the index holds above 24,800. In the near term, particularly on Tuesday, the Indian market may trade sideways as traders await the final verdict on Trump’s additional 25% tariff decision on 27th August. The Nifty is expected to remain within the range of 24,800–25,150 before any decisive directional move. Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities After showing sharp weakness on Friday, Nifty bounced back smartly on Monday and closed the day with decent gains of 97 points. After opening with a positive note, the market continued to surge higher gradually for better part of the session. There was a consolidation movement towards the end and Nifty closed the day off the highs. A small positive candle was formed on the daily chart with minor upper and lower shadow (Inside day type candle pattern). This market action indicates an absence of follow-through selling in the market after a sharp weakness of Friday. This is positive indication. The opening upside gap of 18th Aug remains unfilled after six sessions of its formation. This bullish breakaway gap indicates more upside for the Nifty in the near term. Hence, the next upside target to be watched around 25200-25300 in the near term. Immediate support is placed at 24800.

The rise in the share price comes despite the stock being scheduled to exit the Nifty 50 index as part of the latest rejig. In a note dated August 23, CRISIL Ratings reaffirmed the 'AA+' rating on the long term debt instruments, while assigning a 'Negative' outlook. It removed its rating on the long-term debt instruments of IndusInd Bank from 'Rating Watch with Negative Implications'. CRISIL also reaffirmed its 'A1+' rating on the short-term debt instruments of the company. The ratings agency had placed the long term rating of IndusInd's debt instruments on 'Watch Negative' on May 7, after ""the resignation of top two managerial personnel as well as disclosure of a review being conducted on the bank’s microfinance business by an internal audit department to examine few concerns, brought to attention during finalisation of accounts"", it said. The then CEO Sumant Kathpalia and deputy CEO Arun Khurana resigned from their respective roles in April due to discrepancies in the bank's derivatives portfolio. IndusInd Bank had earlier announced that there were certain accounting lapses in the derivative portfolio which could have a negative impact of 2.35 percent of the bank’s net worth, as of December 2024. Earlier in August, IndusInd Bank announced the appointment of Rajiv Anand as its new Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer. In a press release, the lender announced today that Anand has taken charge at the helm of the company effectively from today. ""The watch resolution takes into account clarity with respect to the appointment of the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and the expectation of no further negative impact in the financial statements on account of lapses in internal financial controls,"" CRISIL said. ""The 'Negative' outlook reflects the modest overall profitability of the bank. The return on assets (RoA) is likely to remain modest over the next few quarters amidst asset quality challenges particularly in the micro loan segment on account of industry wide stress. Improvement in the profitability metrics by the end of fiscal 2026 and sustenance of the same will be critical,"" CRISIL added, while noting that the ratings reflect healthy capitalisation of the bank, with a high core equity ratio and adequate pre-provisioning profitability. The National Stock Exchange (NSE) on August 22 announced changes to its benchmark Nifty 50 index. As part of the semi-annual reshuffle, IndusInd Bank and Hero MotoCorp will be dropped, while Max Healthcare Institute and InterGlobe Aviation, the parent company of IndiGo, will be added to the benchmark index from September 30 onwards, the exchange said. The NSE reviews the composition of the Nifty 50 twice a year, based on the average free-float market capitalisation of stocks during the six months ending January 31 and July 31. The changes take effect in March and September. IndusInd Bank in July reported a 68 percent decline in standalone net profit at Rs 684 crore for the first quarter of FY26, hurt by a decline in loans and a rise in provisions for potential bad loans. On a consolidated basis, net profit fell 72 percent year-over-year to Rs 604 crore. The lender's net interest income fell 14 percent year-on-year to Rs 4,640 crore in Q1FY26. According to Moneycontrol's poll, IndusInd Bank's net interest income (NII) was seen at Rs 4,279 crore in Q1FY26 and profit was pegged at Rs 559 crore in Q1FY26. IndusInd Bank shares closed at Rs 772 apiece on August 25. The stock has fallen more than 6 percent in the past one month, and over 25 percent in the past six months.

Vodafone Idea shares jump up to 16% in two sessions after report says PMO to take call on AGR relief,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/vodafone-idea-shares-jump-16-in-two-sessions-after-report-says-pmo-to-take-call-on-agr-relief-13485251.html,"The shares of Vodafone Idea (Vi) jumped nearly 7.5 percent to day's high on August 25, extending significant gains for the second consecutive session after a report by Mint said that the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) is set to take a call on a relief proposal for the telecom major. The shares of the company gained 16 percent in the two consecutive trading sessions to hit an intraday high of Rs 7.60 apiece on Monday. The stock later pared some gains to close at Rs 7.40 apiece, marking a rise of nearly 5 percent from the previous closing price. PMO had received an informal note from the Department of Telecommunication (DoT), proposing multiple relief options for the debt-ridden telecom company, Mint reported last week citing people familiar with the matter. These options include another two-year pause on paying the statutory dues under moratorium currently. The PMO will take the decision on whether these relief measures are to be extended, said the Mint report cited a source as saying. DoT has also proposed to give Vodafone Idea more time to repay dues, smaller annual payouts, and a waiver on penalties and interest penalties on AGR payment, the report added. Moneycontrol couldn't independently verify the report. Vodafone Idea has been struggling with dues, owing about Rs 83,400 crore in adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues, with annual payments of nearly Rs 18,000 crore scheduled from March 2025. Its overall dues to the government stand at around Rs 2 trillion including penalty and interest, Mint said. The debt-laden operator has repeatedly warned it cannot survive without funding support, as banks remain wary of lending given its financial stress. Vi employs over 18,000 people and has nearly 198 million subscribers. Telecom service provider Vodafone Idea (Vi) is exploring non-bank avenues to fund its capital expenditure plans, as negotiations with lenders remain stalled due to uncertainty over adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues, outgoing CEO Akshaya Moondra said on August 18 during the June quarter earnings call. Vi has also formally urged the government to settle the AGR matter ahead of the March 2026 deadline, which Moondra said would help reassure banks and unlock financing support. ""Given the fact that we are keen on maintaining a continuity of our capex, which has been going on since last year, we are looking at non-banking sources of funding, also not the full amount of Rs 25,000 crore that we have talked about, but a lesser amount so that we can continue with the capex cycle,"" Moondra said. Should you buy, sell or hold? Motilal Oswal recommended a 'Sell' rating for the stock, with a target price of Rs 6 per share. This implies a downside potential of more than 8 percent from the previous closing price of Rs 6.55 per share. “We cut our FY27-28E revenue and EBITDA estimates by ~4-5% each, driven by higher subscriber declines. We reiterate our SELL rating on Vi with a revised TP of INR6, based on DCF implied ~12.5x Sep’27E EV/EBITDA,” the domestic brokerage said. ICICI Securities kept a 'Hold' rating for the stock, with a target price of Rs 7 per share. This implies an upside potential of nearly 7 percent from the previous closing price. ""VIL has funding to incur elevated capex only till Q2FY26; its future capex is dependent on closing the funding arrangement which has been in the process for a while. VIL is also hopeful of a resolution on AGR matter before its first EMI due in Mar’26, remains critical for establishing its going concern status,"" the brokerage noted.

Executives from Hero MotoCorp, Bajaj Auto, TVS Motor, Ola Electric, Ather Energy and Revolt are expected to join the deliberations, a Hindu Businessline report stated. The discussions will focus on measures to drive adoption of electric motorcycles, a segment that makes up two-thirds of India’s two-wheeler sales. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Government estimates suggest electric scooters could account for as much as 80 percent of sales by 2030, but motorcycles may still only reach 10 percent, dragging overall two-wheeler electrification to around 36 percent—well short of policy ambitions. Officials are expected to explore strategies such as scaling up production, reducing upfront costs, battery-swapping models and innovative financing options to make EV motorcycles more affordable and competitive, the report added. The meeting comes at a time when Ola Electric founder Bhavish Aggarwal has reiterated the company’s aim of cornering 25–30 percent share of the domestic two-wheeler EV market, backed by vertical integration and new launches. “Our mojo is still there,” Aggarwal said last week, adding that profitability would remain high as volumes scale. Investor sentiment has also been supported in recent sessions by expectations of a possible GST cut on entry-level two-wheelers, compact cars and hybrids. At about 1:15 pm, shares of the company were up at Rs 48.35, higher by 2.5 percent from the last close on the NSE. Ola Electric Mobility shares are up nearly 20 percent over the last week.

Shreeji Shipping shares to make market debut tomorrow: GMP signals decent listing; what to expect?,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/shreeji-shipping-shares-to-make-market-debut-tomorrow-gmp-signals-decent-listing-what-to-expect-13484908.html,"The shares of Shreeji Shipping Global are set to make their market debut tomorrow (August 26). The Rs 411-crore IPO saw strong investor interest during its three days of public bidding, being subscribed over 58 times between August 19 and August 21. The maiden public issue of the Gujarat-based shipping and logistic solution company entirely comprised a fresh issue of shares at a price band of Rs 240-252 per share. Investors could bid for a minimum of 58 shares, requiring an investment of Rs 14,616 at the upper price band, and in multiples thereafter. Shreeji Shipping Global IPO GMP: Ahead of listing, the unlisted shares of the company were trading with a grey market premium (GMP) of nearly 13.5 percent over the IPO price at Rs 286 apiece, according to data on Investorgain. This is higher than the 12 percent GMP cited by the site on the day of allotments. However, it is lower than the 15 percent cited on its last day of public bidding. According to IPO Watch, the unlisted shares of the company were trading with 11.11 percent GMP over the IPO price in the grey market. Shreeji Shipping Global IPO: What to expect? The strong subscription numbers for Shreeji Shipping Global IPO reflects overwhelming investor appetite, said Harshal Dasani, Business Head, INVasset PMS. ""This enthusiasm came despite a moderation in topline performance, as revenue declined from Rs 736 crore in FY24 to Rs 610 crore in FY25. Profitability, however, showed resilience with a 13 percent year-on-year rise in net profit to Rs 141 crore, aided by tighter cost controls and improved operational efficiency. The company's return ratios remain enviable, with return on equity near 44 percent and return on capital employed above 32 percent, although valuation multiples—around 29 times earnings and over five times book—sit well above sector norms,"" he added. Dasani noted that the dry-bulk segment remains highly exposed to global trade volatility and freight cycles, with concentration risk in customer exposure. ""The fundamentals suggest a well-run company with strong profitability metrics, but the stretched valuations mean near-term listing gains could be offset by future earnings execution. For investors, the stock may be better suited as a tactical play on listing momentum, while long-term exposure requires careful monitoring of industry cycles,"" he further said. Narendra Solanki, Head of Fundamental Research, Investment Services, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers, advised investors to 'hold' the issue for the long term, according to their risk appetite. ""At the upper price band company is valuing at P/E of 28.5x to its FY25 earnings, with EV/EBITDA of 21.4x and market cap of ₹ 41,055 million post issue of equity shares,"" he said.

Accumulate PI Industries; target of Rs 4330: Deven Choksey,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/accumulate-pi-industries-target-of-rs-4330-deven-choksey-13484752.html,"Deven Choksey's research report on PI Industries Consolidated revenue for the quarter came in at INR 19,005 Mn. down 8.1% YoY (+6.3% QoQ), stood sharply below our estimates, due to subdued growth in the exports segment, partially offset by mid-single digit growth in the domestic segment. EBITDA stood at INR 5,191 Mn., down 11.0% YoY (+13.9% QoQ), stood sharply below our estimates, led by a sharp miss in revenue and higher-than-expected employee expense. Adjusted net profit declined by 10.9% YoY (+21.0% QoQ) to INR 4,000 Mn., sharply below our estimates, led by poor operational performance. Gross Profit margin expanded by 565bps YoY (+236bps QoQ) to 57.4%, led by a favorable shift in product mix towards higher-margin molecules, coupled with cost optimization efforts and stronger momentum in margin-accretive segments. EBITDA margin contracted by 88bps YoY (+182bps QoQ) to 27.3%, driven by higher development spend observed in pharma segment, incremental overheads from growth initiatives, and negative operating leverage, partially offset by improvement witnessed in gross margins. Outlook We have rolled forward our valuation to Jun’27 estimates. We value PI Industries at 32.0x Jun’27 EPS (near to its 10-year Avg. NTM P/E), implying a target price of INR 4,330. PI Industries is currently trading at 34.0x/29.3x of our FY26E/FY27E EPS estimates. We reiterate our “ACCUMULATE” rating on the stock as we see near-term pressures as transient, with H2FY26E recovery led by exports and new launches.

"Duty-free cotton offers breather to textile stocks, but US tariff cloud continues to loom",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/duty-free-cotton-offers-breather-to-textile-stocks-but-us-tariff-cloud-continues-to-loom-13484442.html,"Stocks such as Vardhman Textiles, Ambika Cotton Mills, Gokaldas Exports and Indo Count Industries enjoyed a short-lived buzz as India removed duties on raw cotton imports till September 30 in a signal to the US. While analysts believe that the temporary relief could bring respite to their tight margins over the near term as the government aims to cool domestic prices, the medium-term trajectory hinges on how these companies navigate the uncertainty arising from the tariffs levied by the US, and diversify into newer markets. From August 27, India will face 50 percent tariffs from the US administration. A planned visit by US trade negotiators to New Delhi from August 25-29 has been called off, delaying talks on a proposed bilateral trade agreement and dampening hopes of relief from an additional 25 percent US levy starting August 27. Sentiment positive but gaps remain Independent analyst Ambareesh Baliga agreed that the move is sentimentally positive for cotton stocks that have been wealth destroyers this year. Lower input costs will make the supply chain more competitive, benefiting the entire textile value chain, including yarn, fabric, garments and made-ups, he said. However, Baliga warned that for US-bound exports of apparel and home textiles, the gap would remain significant compared to competing countries such as Bangladesh and Vietnam unless tariffs are reduced to 25 percent. Market expert Ajay Bagga agreed, saying that while the 11 percent duty waiver on raw cotton is a helpful short-term relief for the textile industry, it’s not enough on its own. He believes that the government should roll out a broader support package that includes easier loan access, export incentives and measures to reduce raw material costs. Such steps would give the entire textile value chain, from yarn to garments, the strength to handle challenges like high US tariffs and intense global competition. Indian exports previously faced duties of 0-5 percent, with some textiles taxed at between 9 and 13 percent before tariffs were raised under the Trump administration. Now, the 50 percent tariff is not a standalone levy, it is in addition to the standard US import duty. Reports suggested total duties on Indian textiles and apparel exports to the US will now hit alarming levels across various categories: carpets at 52.9 percent, knitted garments at 63.9 percent, woven garments at 60.3 percent, and textiles and made-ups at 59 percent. This underscores how uncompetitive Indian products will become under the new regime, effectively pricing them out of the US market. Competing nations have the edge Moreover, it makes Indian garment exporters uncompetitive against rivals in Bangladesh and Vietnam, where US duties are around 20 percent, and China, at 30 percent. Most of these companies are heavily dependent on the US. Gokaldas Exports derives around 70 percent of its revenue from the North American country. Welspun Living earns about 65 percent of its revenue from the US, where it is a leading exporter of towels and bed linen. Indo Count Industries also derives nearly 70 percent of its sales from exports, with the US as its dominant market. Unless these players diversify beyond the US, maintaining profitability in the coming quarters will be challenging, experts warned. Diversification and margin play On its earnings call, Gokaldas Exports said the second half of the fiscal looks even more challenging as US brands have begun raising end-retail prices, which could hit demand and drive tougher negotiations on pricing. The company, however, plans to diversify its business geographically to reduce dependence on a single market. Notably, exports to the EU rose to 13.4 percent in Q1FY26 from 11.6 percent in Q4FY25. Vardhman Textiles, on the other hand, expects margins to improve as duty-free cotton imports kick in. The company has avoided absorbing any US tariff impact in its yarn business so far, and since 30-35 percent of its exports go to Bangladesh, no significant business disruption has been seen. So far this year, shares of Vardhman Textiles, Ambika Cotton Mills, Gokaldas Exports and Indo Count Industries have dropped up to 30 percent. According to Baliga, much of the tariff impact is already priced in, but the sector’s fortunes now hinge on whether the US administration rolls back the duties imposed on India, something that could ease margin stress for these textile players.

KPIT among top engineering R&D plays as Motilal initiates coverage: Check out the rationale,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/kpit-among-top-engineering-r-d-plays-as-motilal-initiates-coverage-check-out-the-rationale-13484757.html,"Despite a recent slowdown in capex by western car makers, the long-term outlook remains robust, Motilal Oswal said in a note, as global mobility is accelerating the role of software in vehicles prompting it to initiate coverage on automotive engineering R&D (ER&D) players KPIT Tech, Tata Technologies and Tata Elxsi. The note said ER&D specialists with 'domain depth, co-development, and global delivery' are well-poised to benefit from the tailwinds. ""Despite the recent moderation in capex cycles among Western OEMs, the long-term outlook remains robust. Asian OEMs are pivoting toward hybrids and localized strategies, while global players are recognizing software as the key competitive frontier,"" the note said. Motilal Oswal added that several Asian OEMs are 'pivoting' toward hybrids and more localised strategies, and global players are betting on software as the next 'competitive frontier'. All this, MOSL said, makes specialized engineering service players an attract longer term bets. MOSL note said the shift is mobility has been towards CASE (connected, autonomous, shared, electric), which is accelerating the role of software in vehicles. As a result, OEMs are moving towards a centralized domain and preparing for software-defined vehicles (SDVs). Also, regulations world over are nudging automakers towards greener mobility, leading to electric powertrains. For MOSL, KPIT Technologies is a Buy with a target of Rs 1,600 per share, valued at 40x FY27E EPS, reflecting its strength in SDV and 'middleware' capabilities. ""The company’s core strengths lie in embedded software development, E/E (Electrical/Electronic) architecture, and middleware consulting, accounting for over 80% of its revenue,"" Motilal Oswal said. The note also initiated coverage on Tata Tech and Tata Elexi, though with a Sell rating. For Tata Elxsi, there is a near-term growth headwind in Europe, along with a less favourable risk–reward at current valuation, said MOSL. Tata Tech is at a discount to KPIT owing to its lower margin profile due to 'higher mechanical exposure, client concentration risks, and modest growth visibility.'

"JK Paper, TNPL, other paper stocks rise up to 17% as Centre sets minimum price on import of packaging material",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/jk-paper-tnpl-other-paper-stocks-rise-up-to-17-as-centre-sets-minimum-price-on-import-of-packaging-material-13484163.html,"Shares of paper companies surged up to 17 percent in early trade on August 25 after the government imposed a Minimum Import Price (MIP) on Virgin Multi-layer Paper Board (VMPB), a move aimed at curbing cheaper imports. Tamilnadu Newsprint and Papers Ltd (TNPL) led the rally, building on early gains to climb by 17 percent to an intraday high of Rs 179.90 on the NSE after two consecutive sessions of decline. JK Paper also advanced sharply, rising 15 percent after four days of losses. West Coast Paper Mills jumped 13.71 percent, while Orient Paper and Industries rose 8.16 percent. Malu Paper Mills and Andhra Paper also gained up to 12 percent in early trade. The Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), in a notification, had said that the MIP will remain in force till March 31, 2026. By fixing a floor price for imports, Centre has effectively made cheap foreign supplies costlier, providing relief to domestic producers. Paper companies in India have long complained of competition from low-priced imports, particularly from Indonesia and China. The Indian Paper Manufacturers Association had in June sought an anti-dumping probe against imports of VMPB from Indonesia. Virgin Multi-layer Paper Board is widely used in packaging for pharmaceuticals, FMCG, food and beverages, electronics, cosmetics, liquor, and also in publishing. By fixing a minimum import price, the government has made cheap imports costlier. This protects local companies, as importers either have to pay more for imported paper board or buy from Indian producers. As a result, domestic demand is expected to shift towards Indian paper companies.

"Nazara Tech shares fall 11% to hit 3-month low, Delta Corp down 2% as online gaming bill becomes law",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/nazara-tech-shares-fall-11-to-hit-3-month-low-delta-corp-down-2-as-online-gaming-bill-becomes-law-13484359.html,"The shares of gaming companies extended significant losses on August 25 after President Droupadi Murmu gave her assent to the Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Bill, 2025, officially making it a law in India. Nazara Technologies shares tumbled over 11 percent to trade at Rs 1,026.70 apiece in the morning. Notably, this is the lowest level seen by the stock in over three months. The gaming stock has so far fallen over 26 percent in the past five days, and currently has a P/E ratio of nearly 95. Delta Corp shares meanwhile dropped around 2 percent to trade at Rs 86.29 apiece. The stock has dropped nearly 6 percent in the past six months, and is down around 23 percent in 2025 so far. The new law prohibits online money games where a user makes a deposit, directly or indirectly, with the expectation of earning winnings on that deposit. Analysts expect that the immediate fallout of the new law would be job losses, the collapse of start-ups, and a sharp drop in foreign and domestic investment. The move threatens to wipe out around 2 lakh jobs, Rs 25,000 crore in foreign direct investment, and Rs 20,000 crore in tax revenues, they say. The move is set to give a blow to the country's $3.8 billion gaming industry that has drawn the attention of global investors and fostered fantasy sports apps like Dream11, Games24X7 and Mobile Premier League. The law includes an imprisonment of up to three years and/or a fine of up to Rs 1 crore. It also includes a provision where repeated offences could attract 3-5 years imprisonment and fines up to Rs 2 crore. The proposed legislation also recommends a regulator for e-sports, educational platforms, and social games. Minister for Electronics and Information Technology Ashwini Vaishnaw while tabling the bill in Rajya Sabha termed online money games as a 'public health risk"". ""There are addiction and withdrawal symptoms. Many families have been destroyed,"" Vaishnaw said. The minister also said that around 45 crore people have been affected, and around Rs 20,000 crore have been lost because of online money games. Nazara Tech said on August 22 its associate firm, Moonshine Technologies, which operates PokerBaazi and other card-based platforms, has ceased offering online games played with money. Ananay Jain, Partner, Grant Thornton Bharat said that the blanket restrictions on certain real-money games may stifle segments of the gaming market that were previously generating significant revenue, particularly in mobile gaming and tournament-based platforms. ""Smaller start-ups and emerging developers may face compliance burdens and financial strain due to penalties and regulatory requirements."" Several real-money gaming (RMG) companies are likely to file writ petitions, as early as possible this week, in 2-3 high courts of the country against the contentious online-gaming Act passed by the Parliament on Thursday, three people directly aware of the matter told Moneycontrol. Sources say, the companies are having consultations currently to decide whether to file petitions individually or through federations, in order to seek a stay on the implementation of the 'Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Bill, 2025'.

The rise in the share prices pushed the Nifty Realty index up nearly 1 percent to hover around 918 in the early trading hours of Monday, while Nifty Metal index rose over 1 percent to stand at 9,477, snapping a two-day losing streak. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on August 22 said that the weak job market may soon force the American central bank to cut interest rates. ""Downside risks to employment are rising,"" according to Powell's prepared remarks at the Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium. He added that ""the effects of tariffs on consumer prices are now clearly visible"" with high uncertainty in the coming months. Most investors now expect a 25-basis-point Fed rate cut next month. ""Fed chief Powell's remark at Jackson Hole that 'there is a downside risk to unemployment and shifting risk balance may warrant policy adjustment' clearly indicates a rate cut in September,"" said VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited. A rate cut in the US could reduce borrowing costs for foreign investors, encouraging them to invest in higher growth markets in India. This boosts real estate and metal stocks. Additionally, investors expect the RBI to follow Fed in the pursuit of a rate cut, if any. This too can positively impact the stocks. Jindal Stainless Steel was the top gainer on the Nifty Metal index, rising nearly 5 percent to trade at Rs 813.35 apiece. Hindalco Industries and National Aluminium Company (NALCO) shares gained nearly 2 percent, while NMDC, Hindustan Zinc, Vedanta and SAIL shares were up more than 1 percent each. Tata Steel, Welspun Corporation, Adani Enterprises, JSW Steel and Hindustan Copper shares rose up to 1 percent. On the realty index, Brigade Enterprises was the top gainer. The shares of the company rose over 1 percent to trade at Rs 974 apiece. Godrej Properties shares also gained more than 1 percent. DLF and Sobha shares were up nearly 1 percent each.

"Mazagon Dock rises 4% on buzz of Rs 70,000-cr submarine talks with Germany's Thyssenkrupp",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/mazagon-dock-rises-4-on-buzz-of-rs-70-000-cr-submarine-talks-with-germany-s-thyssenkrupp-13483812.html,"Shares of Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Ltd surged 4 percent to Rs 2,799 on August 25 after CNBC TV-18 reported that the Ministry of Defence has authorised the company to open cost negotiations with Germany’s Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems for building six submarines under the Rs 70,000-crore P-75(I) programme. Talks are expected to commence shortly, with the final contract likely to be awarded to the Mazagon Dock–Thyssenkrupp consortium about six months after negotiations are concluded successfully, according to CNBC TV-18 sources. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates The approval marks a key step forward in the P-75(I) deal. The two companies had already signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in June 2023, under which Thyssenkrupp would handle engineering and design, while Mazagon Dock would undertake construction and delivery of the submarines for the Indian Navy. While the development has excited investors, analysts remain cautious. JPMorgan, in a note last week, said there was ""little incremental positive newsflow"" around the award of the P-75(I) contract. The brokerage has an “underweight” rating on Mazagon Dock with a price target of Rs 2,468, citing an unfavourable risk-reward equation even after the stock corrected nearly 30 percent from its peak of Rs 3,775. On July 28, the company reported a net profit of Rs 452 crore for the first quarter of the financial year 2026. This marks a decline of around 35 percent on-year from the Rs 696 crore net profit reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year. Sequentially, the firm's net profit rose nearly 39 percent quarter-on-quarter from the Rs 325 crore reported in Q4 FY25. While net profit declined annually, the firm’s revenue from operations rose over than 11 percent on-year to Rs 2,626 crore in Q1 FY26. Revenue from operations however, fell more than 17 percent sequentially. At about 9:30 am, shares of the company were trading at Rs 2,750, higher by 2 percent from the last close on the NSE. Mazagon Dock shares have tanked 23 percent in the last three months. However, they're still in green on a year-to-date basis, up 21 percent.

"Sensex rises 200 pts, Nifty nears 24,950 as Powell’s Jackson Hole speech fuels September rate cut hopes",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sensex-rises-200-pts-nifty-nears-24-950-as-powell-s-jackson-hole-speech-fuels-september-rate-cut-hopes-13483680.html,"Benchmark indices Nifty and Sensex were off to a flying start on Monday, August 25, after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s remarks at the Jackson Hole Symposium suggested a rate cut at the Fed’s September 16–17 meeting. At about 9:25 am, the Sensex was up 211.98 points or 0.26 percent at 81,518.83, and the Nifty was up 57.50 points or 0.23 percent at 24,927.60. About 1810 shares advanced, 1144 shares declined, and 197 shares were unchanged. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates ""Powell did something that no one thought he would – he went ahead and signalled that the Fed is ready to cut interest rates at their next meeting. The bar is extremely high now for the Fed to leave rates unchanged in less than a month,"" said market expert Ajay Bagga. He added that investors should align allocations towards risk and rate-sensitive plays—quality cyclicals, duration, and select commodities—while keeping a close eye on upcoming jobs and inflation data. ""Fed chief Powell’s remark at Jackson Hole that ‘there is a downside risk to unemployment and shifting risk balance may warrant policy adjustment’ clearly indicates a rate cut in September. The US stock market gave a thumbs up to this comment, says V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments Ltd. ""The positive factor may not get reflected in the Indian market as much since tariff concerns are likely to weigh more,"" he added. Among individual movers, Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Ltd surged 3 percent after CNBC-TV18 reported that the Ministry of Defence has cleared the company to start cost negotiations with Germany’s Thyssenkrupp Marine for building six submarines under the Rs 70,000-crore P-75(I) project. Talks are expected to begin shortly, with the contract likely to be awarded to Mazagon Dock and Thyssenkrupp around six months after successful negotiations, the report said.

According to Nuvama Alternative & Quantitative Research, 3.52 crore shares—about 20 percent of the company’s outstanding equity—became eligible for trade at the end of the one-and-a-half-year lock-in period. Technical View On the technical front, Nifty is holding on to support near 24,800. A shooting star on the weekly chart, coupled with call writing at higher levels and unwinding of puts, suggests limited upside and prolonged consolidation. Unless the index clears 25,150, upside momentum is likely to remain capped, while holding above 24,800 is critical to avoid deeper cuts. For now, analysts advise a “sell on rise” strategy, with traders watching 25,000 on the upside and 24,800 on the downside for the next decisive move. The Bank Nifty mirrors a similar setup. The index is clinging to support at 55,000 after giving up prior gains, with heightened call writing and put unwinding pointing to a fragile structure. ""Holding above the 55,000 mark is critical to avoid deeper cuts, while any sustained move below it may open the door for further downside. On the upside, only a decisive reclaim above 56,150 would negate the weak bias. For now, the structure favours a ‘sell on rise’ strategy, with traders eyeing 55,000 as the key trigger zone for the next leg of directional momentum,"" said Dhupesh Dhameja of SAMCO Securities. TCS, Tech Mahindra, Bajaj Finance, NTPC and Hindalco were the top gainers on the Nifty. Laggards on the index included ICICI Bank, SBI Life Insurance, Apollo Hospitals, Maruti Suzuki, and Jio Financial Services.
