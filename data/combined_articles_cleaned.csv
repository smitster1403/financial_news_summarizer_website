Bulls dominated market breadth, with about 2,191 shares gaining compared to 366 declining on the NSE. The market mood is likely to remain upbeat in the upcoming session. Below are some trading ideas for the near term: Rajesh Palviya, Senior Vice President Research (Head Technical Derivatives) at Axis Securities KPR Mill | CMP: Rs 974.85 KPR Mill has witnessed a short-term trend reversal on the daily chart, forming higher tops and bottoms. The stock is well-positioned above its 20, 50, 100, and 200-day SMAs, reconfirming bullish sentiment. Rising volumes over the past couple of weeks indicate increased participation. The daily and weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) is in positive territory, suggesting buying interest at current levels. Investors should consider buying, holding, and accumulating this stock. The expected upside is Rs 1,130–1,213, with downside support in the Rs 930–900 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,130, Rs 1,213 Stop-Loss: Rs 930 Valor Estate (DB Realty) | CMP: Rs 174.5 On the weekly chart, Valore Estate has decisively broken out of its one-year down-sloping channel on a closing basis, indicating a trend reversal. Substantial rising volumes signal increased participation. The positive crossover of the 20 and 50-day moving averages indicates growing momentum and a bullish trend. The daily and weekly RSI is also in positive territory, suggesting potential buying interest. Investors are advised to buy, hold, and accumulate the stock. The expected upside is Rs 209–219, with downside support at Rs 161–155. Strategy: By Target: Rs 209, Rs 219 Stop-Loss: Rs 161 Cholamandalam Financial Holdings | CMP: Rs 1,780.4 Cholamandalam Financial is trending higher, forming a series of higher tops and bottoms, indicating a positive bias. The stock has recently reclaimed its 20, 50, 100, and 200-day SMAs, with the averages trending upward along with price, which supports bullish sentiment. Strong volumes near the support zone further suggest buying interest. The weekly Bollinger Band buy signal indicates increased momentum, while the weekly and monthly RSI is also in favourable territory. Investors should consider buying, holding, and accumulating. The expected upside is Rs 1,985–2,100, with downside support in the Rs 1,630–1,580 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,985, Rs 2,100 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,630 Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi ITC | CMP: Rs 421.55 In the last session, ITC broke above the R3 Camarilla Pivot resistance of Rs 417 and closed strong, signaling a bullish breakout after consolidating between Rs 390–415. The RSI, which held near 40 during the consolidation, is now above 60, supporting the bullish outlook. This breakout, supported by momentum indicators, suggests potential upside in the upcoming sessions. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 420–422 zone, with an upside target of Rs 444. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 444 Stop-Loss: Rs 410 Clean Science and Technology | CMP: Rs 1,180.95 Clean Science has recently formed a textbook bullish Bat pattern on the daily chart, supported by rising volumes from the bottom, indicating strong buying interest. Notably, the Bat pattern’s reversal zone aligns with the S3 monthly Camarilla pivot, adding technical confluence. Additionally, an Inside Value relationship is observed between March and April pivots, where April’s R3 and S3 lie within March’s range. This setup often precedes a significant breakout, hinting at a potentially explosive move. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 1,175–1,185 zone, targeting Rs 1,300. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,300 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,120 Shree Renuka Sugars | CMP: Rs 26.98 On the daily chart, RSI for Shree Renuka Sugars has shown bullish divergence near the key support zone of Rs 25–26, indicating potential reversal strength. A classic Hammer candlestick has also formed around this support area, reinforcing bullish sentiment. Moreover, the Inside Value relationship between March and April Camarilla pivots—where April’s R3 and S3 lie within March’s range—suggests price compression. This combination of technical signals points toward a likely breakout. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 26–27 zone, targeting Rs 31. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 31 Stop-Loss: Rs 24 Osho Krishan, Senior Analyst - Technical & Derivative Research at Angel One ACC | CMP: Rs 2,007.35 ACC has shown impressive growth, climbing nearly Rs 200 in recent trading weeks. This surge has been accompanied by an increase in average trading volumes, indicating building market interest and a potential trend reversal. The stock has also surpassed its 51-day EMA after a prolonged period. Additionally, the 14-period RSI has risen above its previous swing high, reinforcing the bullish momentum. These indicators suggest that ACC may be entering a period of sustained growth. We recommend buying around Rs 2,000–1,980, with a stop-loss at Rs 1,870, targeting Rs 2,200. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,200 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,870 Deepak Fertilisers and Petrochemicals Corporation | CMP: Rs 1,206.45 Deepak Fertilisers has seen a solid recovery following a consolidation phase and is now positioned above all major EMAs, including the 200-day SMA. Recent buying activity has been backed by rising volumes, indicating positive developments. Furthermore, the stock is comfortably above the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent correction, enhancing the bullish outlook. The MACD indicator also shows a positive crossover above the zero signal line, suggesting building momentum. Hence, we recommend buying around Rs 1,200–1,180. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,300, Rs 1,360 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,100 Gujarat Gas | CMP: Rs 428.3 Gujarat Gas has experienced a strong resurgence in recent weeks, resulting in a robust weekly close. The stock is now trading above all its 50-day EMAs on the daily chart after a prolonged period, reflecting inherent strength and likely continuation of the trend. A breakout from the previous swing high, backed by strong volumes, adds to the bullish narrative. We recommend buying on dips around Rs 410–400. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 440, Rs 460 Stop-Loss: Rs 380 Jay Thakkar, Vice President & Head of Derivatives and Quant Research at ICICI Securities Grasim Industries Futures | CMP: Rs 2,662 Grasim has seen strong Put additions in the previous trading session from the Rs 2,600 to Rs 2,660 strikes, along with Call unwinding at those levels. This activity helped the PCR return to a neutral level, now at 1. The highest Put open interest is at the Rs 2,500 strike, while Calls are still concentrated between Rs 2,600 and Rs 2,680, which may unwind further as the stock is trading well above its maximum pain and modified maximum pain levels of Rs 2,600 and Rs 2,596, respectively. Grasim is also trading above its 20-day VWAP, which is around Rs 2,550. There were a few short positions added in the previous leg, and despite that, the price moved higher, which could lead to short covering in the upcoming sessions. Buy Grasim Futures in the range of Rs 2,660 to Rs 2,630. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,730, Rs 2,780 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,570 Aurobindo Pharma Futures | CMP: Rs 1,089.2 Aurobindo Pharma had previously corrected mainly due to long unwinding, and currently, there are not many short positions in the stock. From a positioning standpoint, it remains relatively light in the broader market. The PCR improved in the last trading session to 0.72, primarily due to significant Put writing from the Rs 980 to Rs 1,100 strikes, along with Call unwinding from Rs 1,060 to RS 1,100 strikes. The highest Call open interest is at Rs 1,200, which also aligns with the short-term target. The stop-loss is placed at Rs 1,040, offering a favourable risk-reward ratio for the bulls. While the stock is trading below its 20-day VWAP and maximum pain level—which could act as near-term resistance—the recent options activity indicates a high probability of these levels being challenged. Buy Aurobindo Pharma Futures in the range of Rs 1,090 to Rs 1,070. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,200, Rs 1,260 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,040 Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Chip-related shares, including Tokyo Electron Ltd., may be active Monday after US President Donald Trump’s administration exempted some smartphones, computers and other electronics from its so-called reciprocal tariffs. While he later downplayed the exemption, saying he will still apply tariffs to them, for now companies including Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp. will not be subject to 125% China levy and a 10% flat rate around the globe. “While concerns over tariffs remain and the market may not rise sharply, it may at least show signs of a reversal,” said Shoji Hirakawa, chief global strategist at Tokai Tokyo Intelligence Lab, commenting on Trump’s pause on levies for some consumer electronics. Investors will also be watching for any developments in tariff negotiations after local broadcaster NHK reported Japan’s top trade representative Ryosei Akazawa is set to visit the US this week for talks with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer.

Markets see wild swings amid trade war jitters; Harmonic patterns signal reversal in Nifty Auto index,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/markets-see-wild-swings-amid-trade-war-jitters-harmonic-patterns-signal-reversal-in-nifty-auto-index-12992899.html,"The storm is back — and it’s not for the faint-hearted. Volatility surged to its highest level since the peak of the COVID-19 crisis, with global markets caught off guard after US President Donald Trump reignited trade tensions by initiating a new round of tariffs. China's strategic retreat from immediate retaliation only added more fuel to the uncertainty. The result? A rollercoaster week in equity markets characterised by aggressive gap-ups and gap-downs that tested both nerves and strategies. But while panic might have defined the sentiment for many, seasoned traders with a structured, rule-based approach thrived in the chaos. For these disciplined participants, volatility isn’t the enemy — it’s an opportunity. Among several analytical tools, harmonic trading patterns have emerged as a powerful framework for navigating these erratic markets. One sector, in particular, is flashing a potential reversal signal: the Nifty Auto Index. Nifty Auto Index Weekly Chart Technical analysts are closely watching the Bullish Black Swan harmonic pattern visible on the weekly chart of the Nifty Auto Index. The index peaked in September 2024, only to fall over 30 percent from its high—a move that many would label a definitive bearish trend. But where others see a continued fall, harmonic traders see reversal potential. This specific Black Swan pattern aligns with multiple Fibonacci retracement levels, reinforcing its credibility. By nature, harmonic patterns signal trend exhaustion and reversal, encouraging traders to buy at critical bottoms formed at the convergence of these key ratios. The presence of a Bullish Belt Hold candlestick formation, typically associated with sharp buyer interest after an extended downtrend, adds further weight. RSI (Relative Strength Index) is showing a positive divergence, suggesting that despite price falling to new lows, momentum is improving—a classic trap for complacent bears. MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) has printed a bullish crossover, and the histogram is consolidating near the zero line, signaling a shift in momentum. With the index approaching technically significant support levels, select stocks are offering attractive risk-to-reward setups that traders should monitor. Stock Watch: Technical Reversal in Focus MRF MRF, India's most premium tyre manufacturer and one of the costliest stocks in the Indian markets, is turning heads again—not for its price tag, but for what the weekly chart is signalling. The stock has bounced off its long-term 200-Week Exponential Moving Average (200WEMA) Channel, a reliable zone of historical support defined using both the highs and lows of the 200WEMA. This zone has acted as a cushion during multiple market downturns. Interestingly, MRF has also formed a Rising Three candlestick pattern, typically a continuation pattern. In this context—emerging off key support—it suggests a reversal backed by bullish strength. Traders watching the confluence of candlestick signals and moving average dynamics may find this a potential opportunity. Exide Industries Exide, one of India's oldest and most trusted battery manufacturers, is showing signs of life on the technical front. After months of consolidation and weakness, the stock appears to be reversing from the lower bounds of its 200WEMA Channel—a zone it has respected over multiple market cycles. The Bullish Belt Hold pattern near the support zone signals the potential reversal. Just like MRF, this structural bounce from a long-term support level increases the probability of a trend reversal, especially when supported by broad-based bullish cues from the sector and the index. With a potential bottom, Exide offers an interesting risk-adjusted trade setup for mid- to long-term traders. Time to Rethink Volatility In turbulent times, headlines and emotions can easily sway one. However, for those who stay grounded in process and pattern recognition, such volatility often plants the seeds of future opportunities. The Nifty Auto Index may well be on the verge of a reversal, with stocks like MRF and Exide Industries lining up as early beneficiaries. While confirmation is always key, the setup is promising—and those watching closely may find themselves ahead of the next big move.

India can ease Trump tariff risks by importing more US oil: Alchemy’s Hiren Ved,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/india-can-ease-trump-tariff-risks-by-importing-more-us-oil-alchemy-s-hiren-ved-12992791.html,"As the United States sharpens its focus on reciprocal trade under US President Donald Trump's second term in charge, India must prepare to defend its economic interests. One way to do that, says Hiren Ved, Director and CIO of Alchemy Capital Management, is by narrowing its $36 billion trade surplus with the US—strategically and amicably. ""There are two significant levers India can pull,"" Ved said. ""One is importing defence equipment. The other, more immediate one, is oil."" Also read: US tightening on Chinese goods opens huge export window for Indian e-comm sellers: GTRI Ved pointed to recent data to make his case. In 2024, India imported 232 million tonnes of crude oil. Of this, 38 percent came from Russia—an enormous jump from just 2 percent in 2022. The reason? Post-Ukraine war sanctions on Moscow created an opportunity for India to buy discounted Russian crude. However, this shift came at the cost of other suppliers. The US, which once accounted for 9 percent of India’s oil imports, saw its share shrink to just 4 percent in the first nine months of FY25. It had dipped to 3 percent in 2024. ""If India were to restore US oil’s share to 9 percent, that alone could add $7.6 billion in imports, assuming a price of $70 per barrel,"" Ved estimated. ""That’s enough to reduce a quarter of the trade surplus."" Read more: Gold soars to record highs amid market turmoil triggered by Trump’s tariff blitz He acknowledged this would mean trimming imports from countries like Russia or those in the Middle East. ""But oil is one area where India has flexibility—and where buying more from the US can have real diplomatic payoff,"" he said. Beyond oil, Ved believes India has taken a far more ""mature and measured"" approach in its trade diplomacy with the US. Unlike other countries that have retaliated against Washington’s protectionist posturing, India has chosen engagement over escalation. ""India never went down the road of confrontation. No reciprocal tariffs, no public criticism,"" Ved said. Instead, India has been ""way ahead"" in negotiating a possible trade deal with the US—perhaps as early as June, some reports claimed. In recent months, India has proactively slashed tariffs on goods popular with US exporters. Duties on high-end motorcycles have been cut from 50 percent to as low as 30 percent. Bourbon whiskey duties have been lowered from 150 percent to 100 percent. Telecom equipment now faces just 10 percent duty, down from 20 percent. ""India’s actions have been conciliatory, not reactionary,"" Ved said. ""This is the kind of mature statecraft that gives India an edge. We’re not picking fights—we’re finding solutions."" On April 9, US President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs for most countries—excluding China—while retaining a 10 percent baseline tariff across the board. For India, which has been the only nation in active trade negotiations with the US since the start of the Trump administration, the move comes as a partial relief. The 26 percent reciprocal tariff that was to apply to Indian goods now stands temporarily suspended. However, the 10 percent baseline tariff, implemented globally from April 5, will continue to apply.","""India’s actions have been conciliatory, not reactionary,"" Ved said.","The US, which once accounted for 9 percent of India’s oil imports, saw its share shrink to just 4 percent in the first nine months of FY25.",Read more: Gold soars to record highs amid market turmoil triggered by Trump’s tariff blitz He acknowledged this would mean trimming imports from countries like Russia or those in the Middle East.,"For India, which has been the only nation in active trade negotiations with the US since the start of the Trump administration, the move comes as a partial relief."
Will an earnings revival reel FPIs back to Indian shores?,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/will-earnings-revival-reel-fpis-back-to-indian-shores-12992757.html,"Experts feel that despite the recent firesale by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs), they may return to Indian shores once the waters calm as India’s growth is expected to be resilient. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, expects FPIs to resume buying once macro headwinds ease. “The US-China tariff war is likely to drag both economies into a slowdown. In contrast, India is expected to grow 6 percent in FY26 due to improved earnings. That relative resilience could lure foreign capital back once clarity returns to global markets,” he added. Vijayakumar attributes the turbulence to global market jitters following the flare-up in US-China trade tensions. ""FPIs had briefly started buying in late March, but resumed selling once market volatility spiked,"" he said. Foreign investors continued to offload Indian equities on Friday, marking the ninth consecutive day of selling. With this, April outflows have climbed to Rs 35,641 crore. The selling streak adds to what has been a difficult few months for FPIs, who have pulled out a staggering Rs 1.74 lakh crore since the beginning of the year. On Friday, they net sold shares worth Rs 2,519 crore, while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) stepped in with net purchases of Rs 3,759 crore.

Ajit Mishra, SVP, Technical Research, at Religare Broking, cautioned that bourses will remain sensitive in the coming week, with the US-China situation and earnings season both in focus.

Bank Nifty continues to show relative strength, as it has reclaimed key averages. As long as it holds above the 50,000 mark, the index could target 52,000 and 53,500 in the near term. Given the heightened volatility, experts advise a cautious, hedged approach for now. However, selective buying opportunities remain, especially in the financial sector. Investors are also being encouraged to accumulate quality stocks from other sectors on dips.","Experts feel that despite the recent firesale by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs), they may return to Indian shores once the waters calm as India’s growth is expected to be resilient.","Read more: 'The surest way to destroy...': China fires back at Trump’s tariffs, quotes Reagan’s warning From a technical standpoint, the Nifty has rebounded after breaching its March lows and is now hovering around 22,900, its 20-day exponential moving average.","Also read: Five of top 10 valued firms add Rs 84,559 cr in valuation last week; HUL major gainer Interestingly, Friday’s session saw domestic benchmarks rally sharply after US President Donald Trump temporarily paused tariffs against over 70 countries, including India, until July.","The selling streak adds to what has been a difficult few months for FPIs, who have pulled out a staggering Rs 1.74 lakh crore since the beginning of the year."

These small caps gave double-digit returns despite indices' muted performance,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/these-smallcaps-give-double-digit-return-despite-index-give-muted-performance-12992412.html,"Broader indices performed in line with the main indices in the volatile week amid escalating trade war between US-China after China’s retaliation. However, there was some relief at the end of the week after the US announced a 90-day pause on tariff hikes for most countries, excluding China. During the week, the BSE Large-cap, Mid-cap, and BSE Small-Cap indices shed between 0.2-0.5 percent. For the week, the BSE Sensex index fell 207.43 points or 0.27 percent to end at 75,157.26, and Nifty50 declined 75.9 points or 0.33 percent to close at 22,828.55. On the sectoral front, the Nifty Realty index shed 4 percent, the Nifty Metal index was down 3 percent, the Nifty IT index declined 2.3 percent, Nifty PSU Bank index shed 1.5 percent. On the other Nifty Consumer Durable and FMCG added more than 3 percent each. ""The Indian market finally closed with a positive bias after a very volatile week, aided by an unexpected pause on reciprocal tariffs by the US providing relief amid uncertainty. Sectors like IT, metals, and capital goods saw a relief rally in expectation of an improvement in the near-term outlook. However, the intensity of the US-China trade war will be crucially viewed by the market, which can have the potential to offset the impact of the current pause on trade tariffs on other emerging markets,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments. ""On the other hand, the market has entered the result season with a subdued expectation. The initial results from the IT major acknowledge the impact of trade tensions and expect a delay in discretionary spending,"" ""The focus will be on the outcome of the ongoing bilateral trade negotiations between India and the US, which will add more colour to the trade potential of the domestic market. The supportive domestic environment with an ease in interest rates and a benign inflation trajectory is encouraging investors to have a balanced portfolio to aid for a better risk-reward in the long term."" ""Looking ahead, we expect inflation is likely to moderate further on account of cooling food prices and would give room for RBI to remain accommodative. We expect caution is likely to prevail due to the holiday-led truncated week,"" he added. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) extended their selling this week as they sold equities worth Rs 20,911.30 crore, while Domestic Institutional Investors (DII) bought equities worth Rs 21,955.62 crore. The BSE Small-cap index ended marginally lower. Gensol Engineering, Jindal Drilling Industries, Unichem Laboratories, Themis Medicare, Vakrangee, Time Technoplast, International Gemmological Institute India, Navkar Corporation, Renaissance Global, JSW Holdings, Kabra Extrusion Technik, Suraj Estate Developers, DEE Development Engineers, Universal Cables, Indostar Capital Finance, Carraro India, Axiscades Technologies fell between 10-18 percent. On the other hand, Nacl Industries, Hampton Sky Realty, Rajoo Engineers, BL Kashyap & Sons, Raghav Productivity Enhancers, Archean Chemical Industries, Sadhana Nitrochem, Senco Gold, Avanti Feeds, Jyothy Labs rise between 10-21 percent. Where is Nifty50 headed? Amol Athawale, VP-Technical Research, Kotak Securities We believe that the current market texture is extremely volatile and uncertain; therefore, level-based trading would be the ideal strategy for positional traders. In the near future, the 50-day and 20-day SMA (Simple Moving Average) or 23,000/75800 would act as crucial resistance zones. On the downside, retracement support is positioned at 22,500/74200. Technical setup indicates that as long as the market is trading above 22,500/74200, the pullback formation is likely to continue. On the higher side, if 23,000/75800 is breached, it could push the market toward 23,200/76400. Conversely, if it falls below 22,500/74200, market sentiment could shift negatively, and traders may prefer to exit their long positions. Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities Technically, this market action indicates a decisive bounce back in the market in the short term after a violent decline amidst tariff war. Nifty is currently placed at the edge of multiple hurdles like the previous opening down gap of 7th April and daily 10 and 20 EMA around 22800-22900 levels. Nifty on the weekly chart formed a bullish meeting line type candle pattern. This is a positive indication. The short-term trend of Nifty remains positive. A sustainable move above 22900-23000 levels could open the upside target of 23400-23500 levels in a quick period of time. Immediate support is placed at 22700 levels. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The Nifty faced resistance around the 21-EMA on the daily timeframe, leading to a close off the day’s high. The trend appears bearish unless it decisively moves above 23,000, where significant open interest has been added. On the downside, support is placed at 22,750; a break below this level could intensify the bearish sentiment. Conversely, a decisive move above 23,000 may trigger a rally towards 23,500, as suggested by the positive divergence in the RSI.

Wall Street ends whipsaw week sharply higher as Fed comments soothe market,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/wall-street-ends-whipsaw-week-sharply-higher-as-fed-comments-soothe-market-2-12992392.html,"Wall Street posted solid gains on Friday as big banks kicked off first-quarter earnings season and investors closed the book on a turbulent week of wild swings driven by the chaos of U.S. President Donald Trump's multi-front trade war. All three major U.S. indexes ended the session sharply higher after assurances from Boston Federal Reserve President Susan Collins that the Fed is prepared to keep financial markets functioning should the need arise. All three indexes posted gains from last Friday's close. Stocks were whipsawed throughout the week by a tariff reprieve on European goods and a tit-for-tat escalation in the trade war between the U.S. and China. One sign of the volatility: the difference between the weekly high and weekly low for the S&P500 was the widest since late March 2020 when much of the world was locked down during the pandemic. The S&P 500 and the Dow notched their largest weekly percentage gains since November 2023, while the Nasdaq registered its biggest weekly percentage advance since November 2022. ""Investors are in the midst of this tug of war looking for some positive signs that the uncertainty that's really been plaguing the market will subside,"" said Greg Bassuk, Chief Executive Officer at AXS Investments in New York. ""Uncertainty and volatility is the new investor narrative,"" Bassuk added. ""The table is set for more volatility ahead and this week's roller coaster ride could be just foreshadowing for what's ahead."" Beijing retaliated to Trump's recent hike of tariffs to an effective rate of 145%. The trade war has caused wild intraday market swings and driven consumers' near-term inflation expectations to their hottest level since 1981. First-quarter reporting period got off to a solid start. JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo all reported better-than-expected profits, but warnings of a potential economic slowdown due to trade disputes dampened enthusiasm for the sector. Analysts currently expect aggregate S&P 500 earnings growth of 8.0% for the first three months of the year, less optimistic than the 12.2% growth predicted at the beginning of the quarter, according to LSEG data. Economic data offered further evidence that inflation continues to cool, with the Labor Department's Producer Prices index unexpectedly falling by 0.4% last month. In a separate report, however, consumer sentiment soured further. One-year inflation expectations shot up to 6.7%, the highest level since 1981. In addition to Collins' reassurances, New York Federal Reserve President John Williams said the U.S. economy is not entering a period of high inflation and low growth, and the U.S. Federal Reserve will act to keep so-called ""stagflation"" at bay. All 11 major sectors in the S&P 500 were last in positive territory, with materials and technology enjoying the largest percentage gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 619.05 points, or 1.56%, to 40,212.71, the S&P 500 gained 95.31 points, or 1.81%, to 5,363.36 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 337.15 points, or 2.06%, to 16,724.46. In a note to clients, Citi said it now expects the S&P 500 to reach 5,800 by year-end, down from an earlier target of 6,500. Citi cited tariffs and signs of a slowing economy.

Fueling the volatility was the White House decision to impose a flat 10 percent tariff on most imports but slapped a steep 145 percent duty on Chinese goods. In response, Beijing hiked tariffs on U.S. products to 125 percent, calling the U.S. move ""a joke in the history of the world economy."" The week had already been marked by dramatic swings. On Wednesday, stocks staged a historic rally after President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on some of his proposed ""reciprocal"" tariffs.

Market Performance US President Donald Trump’s 90-day pause on tariffs brought cheer to Dalal Street, lifting investor sentiment and driving a rally in the benchmark indices. On April 11, both the Sensex and Nifty rose almost 2 percent, marking a strong rebound in the equity markets. The day saw widespread buying across sectors, with metal and pharma stocks leading the gains. Meanwhile, the market's fear barometer, India VIX, declined sharply by 6.21 percent, indicating easing investor anxiety. However, for the holiday-truncated week, Nifty and Sensex were down 0.5 percent each. Barring Nifty FMCG which gained more than 3 percent for the week, all other sectors nosedived in then negative territory. Nifty Realty and Nifty Metal indices were the worst performers for the week, declining in the range of 3-4 percent. ""The rally is unlikely to sustain beyond a point given the elevated uncertainty in global markets. President Trump’s retreat from the reciprocal tariffs imposed on countries except China was forced by the US bond market where instead of safe-haven buying in US treasuries, there was big selling, pushing the 10-year bond yield up to 4.5 percent, VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, said. He added that there is no room for a sustained rally in the market in the present uncertain context. But investors can take relief from the fact that Indian macros are good and we are one of the least impacted countries in this trade war.

A day earlier, those very benchmarks had posted one of their best performances since World War II, with the S&P 500 soaring 9.5 percent and the Dow jumping more than 2,900 points after President Donald Trump offered a temporary 90-day relief on select “reciprocal” tariffs.

Outlook for April 15 Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The Nifty faced resistance around the 21-EMA on the daily timeframe, leading to a close off the day’s high. The trend appears bearish unless it decisively moves above 23,000, where significant open interest has been added. On the downside, support is placed at 22,750; a break below this level could intensify the bearish sentiment. Conversely, a decisive move above 23,000 may trigger a rally towards 23,500, as suggested by the positive divergence in the RSI.

This aggressive stance indicates a strong conviction in a market rebound, even as foreign institutional investors (FIIs) display caution. Derivative analysts said, the high net long may be due to fund managers trying to hedge their high cash positions ahead of the short week with, only three trading days. Record-Breaking DII Long Positions As of April 8, 2025, DIIs held a net long position of 79,153 contracts in index futures, marking an all-time high. This surge surpasses previous highs observed during significant market events: March 2023: 52,700 contracts COVID-19 Crash (2020): 44,035 contracts September 2019 (Corporate Tax Cut): 53,996 contracts In each of these instances, the market experienced a notable uptrend in the subsequent month, suggesting that DIIs' increased long positions have historically aligned with market bottoms. Contrasting FII Behaviour While DIIs are exhibiting strong bullish sentiment, FIIs have been more cautious having built short positions worth 1.09 lakh contracts as of April 8. Normally, mutual funds only engage in arbitrage trades. But certain funds sitting on high cash positions may have built long positions in derivatives to cover themselves from any quick up moves because of the current environment where news triggers sharp moves. Under the circumstances, before you buy stocks in the cash market, managers may be trying to capture the upside through derivatives, to avoid trailing the benchmark because of high cash holdings. This kind of positioning is accentuated because of a short week ahead, traders said. Whether the high long position DII means a bottoming out of markets or a short-term positioning ahead of the short week can’t be said now, but historical data suggests a high position build-up is indicative of a market rally from a one-month perspective.

It's a painful period but not a risk for long-term survival of India: Madhu Kela on market correction,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/it-s-a-painful-period-but-not-a-risk-for-long-term-survival-of-india-madhu-kela-on-market-correction-12991992.html,"Indian markets may well be reeling under pressure due to the ongoing turmoil in global equity markets following Trump tariff actions but market veteran Madhusudan Kela believes that the current situation is not a risk for the long-term survival of India. The market veteran is in fact quite bullish on the India story and believes that the Indian stock market is quite resilient and offers a kind of variety to investors that hardly any other emerging market offers. “We don't think the current situation is a risk for the long term survival of India. Yes, this is a very painful period from an investor perspective, but it is a transition period or temporary phase and hopefully India will emerge a winner. History has shown that the fall is never permanent and we believe that it is more about volatility than real risk for investors,” he said while interacting with media on the sidelines of an investor conference by Singularity AMC. Singularity AMC is a Mumbai-based investment firm, backed by Madhu Kela and led by his nephew Yash Kela. From an investment perspective, he says that investors should keep in mind the two key factors – risk and volatility – of investing and not be fearful. “When it comes to investing there are two key things - risk and volatility. Investors need to see whether the developments in the market are real risk or volatility. If it is only volatility, then it is the best friend of an investor. Because in volatility, he could get shares at fraction of earlier price. But, if it's risk then it's a different thing,” he says. He believes that currently a lot of people are fearful and the common psyche is that when people are fearful they become all the more fearful but one should remember that no other emerging market offers the kind of variety that India offers.

We have more than 1500 companies with more than Rs 1000 crore market cap. In no other emerging market, you can see this kind of variety. I'm very bullish on the India story,” he explains. He also cautioned investors against investing on the basis of tips especially in the current scenario. “Investing on the basis of tips is never a good idea.

Meanwhile, the watches and wearables division reported a 22 percent increase in revenue.

During the quarter, the company launched the first experiential store for its fragrance brand 'SKINN' at Seawoods, Mumbai. Its premium handbag brand 'IRTH' expanded with four new store openings in Hyderabad, Pune, Noida, and Mumbai. Taneira, however, shut down one store in the same period.

White House officials quickly denied the report, sending the market back into the red. Meckler said the market's wild swings on Monday left investors ""a little bit concerned that if facts start to change, you could see a very rapid rise to this market."" ""It's leading to this back-and-forth movement of rallies that are effectively being sold and drops in the market where people are covering shorts or trying to find a place to buy."" Real estate lost 2.4%, the biggest percentage decliner among the S&P's 11 major industry indexes on Monday. Communications services, was the biggest gainer, finishing up 1%.

Its biggest boosts came from Nvidia, up more than 3%, and Amazon.com, which added 2.5%. Several speeches by Federal Reserve officials and a series of economic indicators, including consumer price data, are expected this week, with investors keenly watching out for any signs of a recession.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bajaj Finance, GMR Airports, Chambal Fertilizers, PNB Housing, and others on April 8?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-kotak-mahindra-bank-bajaj-finance-gmr-airports-chambal-fertilizers-pnb-housing-and-others-on-april-8-12987972.html,"The benchmark indices nosedived sharply and closed with a 3 percent decline after recouping around 2 percent from the day's low, tracking tariff-led turmoil in global peers. The market breadth was dismal, with a total of 2,448 shares trapped in a bear market, compared to just 193 shares that outperformed. The trend is expected to remain favourable for bears, but some rebound can't be ruled out, considering the significant fall in the past few days. Below are some trading ideas for the near term: Jay Thakkar, Vice President & Head of Derivatives and Quant Research at ICICI Securities Kotak Mahindra Bank | CMP: Rs 2,037.85 Kotak Mahindra Bank has been one of the outperformers in the Nifty private sector banks, and the uptrend has been largely due to short covering. The stock has provided a breakout from a range lasting more than 3 years, which is quite significant. It is one of the few stocks in the current scenario trading near its all-time high levels, reflecting relative outperformance. Due to the heavy sell-off in the markets during the last trading session, the stock witnessed Put unwinding at almost all the strikes. However, it didn’t see much short addition from current levels; rather, the stock bounced back from lower levels. Based on these observations, the probability of the stock holding onto the Rs 2,000 levels—its second-highest Put open interest—is quite high, at least on a closing basis. Below that, there is another critical support level at Rs 1,960. Therefore, the risk-reward is favourable on the long side. So, buy Kotak Mahindra Bank in the range of Rs 2,000 to Rs 2,040. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,120, Rs 2,200 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,960 Bajaj Finance | CMP: Rs 8,568 Bajaj Finance has also witnessed a huge range breakout—a consolidation breakout lasting more than 3 years—and the short covering is still pending. Since the prices have fallen back to the level from where it broke upwards, there is a higher probability of short covering, as the stock has not seen a significant short build-up in the recent fall from the top. While there was Put unwinding at most strikes, additions were seen at the Rs 8,400 strike. Hence, the range of Rs 8,500 to Rs 8,400 is very critical in the near term, while Rs 9,000 is an immediate hurdle, making it the first target due to the highest Call open interest. So, buy Bajaj Finance in the range of Rs 8,550 to Rs 8,650. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 9,000, Rs 9,200 Stop-Loss: Rs 8,220 SRF | CMP: Rs 2,715.2 SRF has also outperformed the overall markets recently. There has been a breakout from a huge consolidation due to sharp short covering. Although some fresh short additions were seen in the recent fall, the prices have reversed from the breakout point, making the risk-reward favourable on the long side. The Rs 2,700 strike Put has the highest open interest, while the Rs 3,000 strike Call has the highest open interest. So, the range to watch is Rs 2,700 to Rs 3,000, and since the stock is near the lower end of the range, the bulls have a favourable chance from hereon. Buy SRF in the range of Rs 2,700 to Rs 2,650. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,900, Rs 3,000 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,550 Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi Zomato | CMP: Rs 209.63 Despite a sharp market-wide correction, Zomato outperformed, closing with only a marginal loss. The stock is forming multiple bottoms near the Rs 195 level, indicating strong support. Traders may consider entering long positions near Rs 205, with a stop-loss at Rs 195 and an upside target of Rs 225. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 225 Stop-Loss: Rs 195 GMR Airports | CMP: Rs 82.22 Unlike most F&O stocks, GMR Airports ended with gains in an otherwise volatile market. The stock witnessed a breakout above Rs 80, followed by a sharp pullback, and has now resumed its upward move. This price action suggests renewed strength and presents a potential buying opportunity. Traders may consider entering long positions near Rs 80, with a stop-loss at Rs 76 and an upside target of Rs 88. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 88 Stop-Loss: Rs 76 Anshul Jain, Head of Research at Lakshmishree Investments Chambal Fertilizers and Chemicals | CMP: Rs 612.8 Chambal Fertilizers, after breaking out of a rectangle pattern at Rs 546, offered no buying dips—until today. The stock has now smartly defended its 10–20 day moving average zone, giving short-term traders a golden entry into the momentum. Today’s bullish candle hints at renewed buying interest, supported by the cooling off of previously overheated momentum indicators. With the trend intact and structure strong, Chambal Fertilizers looks poised to clock fresh all-time highs in the coming sessions. Traders should watch for continued strength above support to ride the next leg up. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 700 Stop-Loss: Rs 580 PNB Housing Finance | CMP: Rs 923.65 PNB Housing Finance has defended its rounding bottom breakout impressively, even amid a falling market, with volumes consistently above the 50-day average, signaling strong institutional accumulation. For the bullish momentum to persist, the stock must hold above Rs 940. A sustained move above this level will likely lead to an initial target of Rs 1,050. The volume profile throughout the entire pattern reflects accumulation by strong hands, suggesting confidence in the stock’s long-term potential and positioning it as a frontrunner once market sentiment improves. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,050 Stop-Loss: Rs 880 Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

"Wall Street trades lower as Trump threatens China with steeper tariffs, markets near bear territory",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/wall-street-trades-lower-as-trump-threatens-china-with-steeper-tariffs-markets-near-bear-territory-12987885.html,"Wall Street's main indices continued to trade firmly lower albeit off lows as investors grappled with growing fears of a prolonged trade war and a White House unwilling to blink. Fears deepened as President Trump doubled down on his hardline trade stance, threatening even steeper tariffs on China — a move that escalated an already fraught standoff and pushed US markets closer to bear territory. Also read: India well poised to take advantage of current situation: Piyush Goyal on market upheaval from Trump's tariffs The S&P 500 shed 0.8 percent, now down nearly 20 percent from its February peak — the threshold that typically signals a bear market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 988 points, or 2.6 percent, following two historic 1,500-point declines last week. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.6 percent and is now 24 percent below its record high, with tech stocks once again leading losses. Markets saw a brief bounce at the open on hopes that the White House might consider delaying the sweeping tariff hikes that went into effect over the weekend. But that optimism was short-lived. The administration dismissed talk of a 90-day pause as “fake news,” triggering a sharp reversal. Over the weekend, Trump defended the policy, comparing it to ""medicine"" needed to fix systemic trade imbalances. On Monday, he issued a fresh warning to China on social media, threatening to slap a 50 percent tariff unless Beijing rolled back its retaliatory measures by April 8. Talks, he added, would be suspended if China failed to comply. Read more: Warburg expected to lead troubled MFI Fusion Finance’s rights issue Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed the hardline approach, telling CBS News: “The tariffs are coming... They are going to stay in place for days and weeks.” The sheer scale and speed of the tariff rollout has stunned investors. Rates have been applied across dozens of trade partners without the usual economic justifications. China, instead of seeking negotiations, retaliated immediately with a 34 percent levy on all US imports. With the administration showing little appetite for compromise, Wall Street is now pricing in a long, messy trade war. The market rout is also raising fears of forced selling, as funds scramble to raise cash to meet margin calls. The CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, spiked to 50 on Monday — a level typically associated with extreme market stress. The sell-off spilled into other asset classes. Bitcoin dropped below $77,000, oil prices fell under $60 a barrel, and volatility surged. European markets slumped for a fourth straight session on Monday, caught in the global equity rout sparked by President Trump’s aggressive new tariff regime. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index dropped as much as 6 percent before trimming losses to end 4.54 percent lower. France’s CAC 40 tumbled 4.8 percent, Germany’s DAX shed 4.26 percent, and the UK’s FTSE 100 declined 4.4 percent, as fears of an escalating trade war and a prolonged downturn continued to rattle investor nerves.

"Futile to predict future, stick to asset allocation dharma, says Kotak's Nilesh Shah amid market turmoil",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/futile-to-predict-future-stick-to-asset-allocation-dharma-says-kotaks-nilesh-shah-amid-market-turmoil-12987853.html,"The market, caught in the crossfire of an unpredictable tariff war, is struggling to find its footing. Every fresh development triggers a reaction, and the uncertainty has left sellers in an aggressive mood while buyers are hesitant to commit. ""It’s futile to predict how events will unfold,"" said Nilesh Shah, Managing Director of Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company. ""What investors can do is stick to their asset allocation dharma."" According to Shah, large-cap stocks are fairly valued and deserve a neutral allocation. But any correction should be seen as an opportunity. ""Buy gradually as markets turn cheaper. That’s how you position to be overweight equities,"" he advised. Amid the global noise, Shah believes domestic stories hold promise—especially sectors like cement, building materials, and consumer discretionary, which offer strong long-term potential. He pointed to several tailwinds supporting consumption: tax rebates announced in the budget, reduced EMI burdens thanks to falling interest rates, a likely dip in oil prices, and the expected rollout of the eighth pay commission next year. Indian equities witnessed a massive bloodbath in today's session. Dalal Street went into a freefall on April 7, as panic-selling took the benchmark indices sharply lower. Triggered by Donald Trump’s tariff tantrum on Wall Street, a wave of global jitters wiped out a jaw-dropping Rs 16 lakh crore in market value — the sharpest intraday collapse since June 2024. Inflation fears, a looming consumption crunch, and recession fears had investors running for cover as the Nifty and Sensex plunged deep into the red. India VIX — the fear gauge of the domestic market — soared as much as 66 percent to 22.85 on April 7, marking its sharpest intraday spike since June 4, 2024, according to Bloomberg data. The dramatic surge has completely erased the downtrend that had been in place since the latter half of January this year.

Meanwhile, domestic institutions stepped in with their heftiest buying since February 28, 2025—stacking up stocks worth Rs 12,122 crore. During the trading session of April 7, FIIs bought shares worth Rs 13,372 crore and sold shares worth Rs 22,412 crore. DIIs purchased shares worth Rs 26,528 crore and sold shares worth Rs 14,405 crore. For the year so far, FIIs have been net sellers of shares worth Rs 1.63 lakh crore, while DIIs have net bought Rs 1.96 lakh crore worth of shares. Market Performance Dalal Street went into a freefall on April 7, as panic-selling took the benchmark indices sharply lower.

""The primary reason behind the selloff is the fear of a full-blown global trade war and its potential to tip the world economy into a recession. Countries including China, Canada, and the European Union have spoken about retaliatory tariffs on American goods, and the uncertainty around whether a settlement can be reached before the next phase of tariff hikes is causing widespread nervousness,"" Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Research and Wealth Management said in a conversation with Moneycontrol. Khemka advised against panic selling or making adventurous bets. Instead, he recommended a disciplined, long-term approach. Investors should use the correction to gradually accumulate fundamentally strong, domestically focused companies, particularly in consumption, financials, and banks. These areas are better positioned to weather global headwinds compared to globally exposed sectors like IT, pharma, and metals.

"Bloodbath on Wall Street: S&P500 enters bear market, Dow Jones down 1,300 pts amid trade war fears",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/bloodbath-on-wall-street-s-p500-enters-bear-market-dow-jones-down-1-300-pts-amid-trade-war-fears-12987804.html,"U.S. stocks plunged for a third straight session on Monday, with investors reeling from the fallout of the Trump administration’s aggressive tariff measures that have triggered a global market rout and fears of a deepening trade war. Coming off a brutal week, Monday’s losses added to the wreckage across equity markets. The Dow has now shed more than 1,200 points to trade 3 percent lower for three straight sessions— a historic first — including a staggering 2,231-point tumble on Friday. The S&P 500 lost 6 percent on the last day of the previous week, its sharpest single-day decline since the COVID crash in March 2020, wiping out 10 percent in just two sessions. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq has officially entered bear market territory, now down over 22 percent from its all-time high. Investors had hoped the weekend would bring some signs of moderation or talks following President Trump’s abrupt imposition of 10 percent tariffs on nearly all key U.S. trade partners, which kicked in on Saturday. Instead, the White House struck a combative tone. ""I don’t want anything to go down, but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something,"" Trump said in a Sunday evening statement. ""We’re losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year to China. Until we fix that, there won’t be a deal."" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick reaffirmed the administration’s firm stance, stating that the tariffs were ""definitely going to stay in place for days and weeks,"" quashing any hopes of a near-term reversal. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent echoed the message, adding that while over 50 countries have approached the U.S. for talks, resolving the issue won’t be quick. Canada and the European Union are reportedly preparing countermeasures as well, signalling a broadening of the standoff. Wall Street now fears the selloff could spiral further, as hedge funds and institutional investors are forced to liquidate positions to meet mounting margin calls. The CBOE Volatility Index — Wall Street’s so-called fear gauge — shot up to 50 early Monday, a level rarely seen outside of major bear markets. The ripple effects were felt far beyond U.S. shores. Bitcoin crashed below $77,000, oil prices tumbled under $60 per barrel to multi-year lows, and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong nosedived 13 percent in its steepest drop since 1997. Germany’s DAX also sank, falling as much as 10 percent during Monday’s session. Among the hardest-hit U.S. stocks were high-profile names like Tesla, down 6 percent in early trade, along with Caterpillar — a global construction bellwether — which shed 5 percent. Apple also saw a sharp 4 percent drop. If the S&P 500 closes down 4 percent or more on Monday, it would mark the third consecutive day of such a steep decline — something that hasn’t happened since the depths of the Great Depression in 1933. With the administration showing no signs of backing down and retaliatory measures mounting, traders are bracing for more pain in the days ahead — unless diplomacy steps in to cool things off. As for Indian markets, Dalal Street went into a freefall on April 7, as panic-selling took the benchmark indices sharply lower. Triggered by Donald Trump’s tariff tantrum on Wall Street, a wave of global jitters wiped out a jaw-dropping Rs 16 lakh crore in market value — the sharpest intraday collapse since June 2024. Inflation fears, a looming consumption crunch, and recession fears had investors running for cover as the Nifty and Sensex plunged deep into the red. India VIX — the fear gauge of the domestic market — soared as much as 66 percent to 22.85 on April 7, marking its sharpest intraday spike since June 4, 2024, according to Bloomberg data. The dramatic surge has completely erased the downtrend that had been in place since the latter half of January this year.

Britannia (up by 0.65% at closing) BritanniaShares of the FMCG major gained during the market mayhem, with Nifty FMCG index emerging as the least-impacted index, with 3 out of 15 constituents in the positive. The relative outperformance of FMCG is attributed to their consumer-facing nature, which provides cushion during market volatility. Trent (down by 14.77% at closing) TrentShares of Trent fell sharply by about 18% after the promoter of Zudio and Westside apparel chains announced a weak Q4FY25 business update, showing Q4FY25 revenue was lower than estimate.

Bharat Petroleum (down by 1% at closing) Bharat PetroleumShares of BPCL ended in the red with losses, however, the stock rebounded by nearly 5 percent from its day’s lows. The fall in Brent crude is expected to benefit oil marketing companies as the decline in crude prices would lower their input costs. Delhivery (down by 3.69% at closing) DelhiveryOwing to acquisition of Ecom Express, Delhivery shares defy general market sentiment and leap 4%. Estimates predict further upward movement. Delhivery has formally announced its decision to acquire a rival firm, Ecom Express Limited, for a total sum of Rs 1,407 crore. Mazagaon (down by 8.39%) Mazagon Dock ShipbuildersThe shares of Mazagon crashed nearly 10 percent, marking a downgrade for a third continuous session, fuelled by government's plans to sell up to 4.83 percent stake in the PSU defence firm. Kotak Bank (down by 4.41% at closing) Nifty Bank indexThe banking index ended down more than 3 percent following US President Trump's slew of tariffs on multiple countries.

"Motilal Oswal sees cement demand to rebound from mid-April; picks Ultratech, JK Cement",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/motilal-oswal-sees-cement-demand-to-rebound-from-mid-april-picks-ultratech-jk-cement-12990891.html,"Cement demand displayed mixed trends over the past month, though dealers anticipate an improvement starting mid-April in India, driven by increased labour availability and a likely rise in demand from government-led infrastructure projects, according to analysts at Motilal Oswal in their latest channel checks report. ""Cement demand witnessed mixed trends, with a strong uptick in the South and Bihar markets, whereas demand was weak in the rest of the country. Dealers expect demand should improve from mid-April 2025 in the rest part of the country, with the increase in labor availability, an expected surge in demand from government-led infra projects, and consistently strong demand from real estate segment,"" they stated. Motilal Oswal’s channel checks highlighted that the cement industry announced price hikes in April 2025. As a result, the average price increased by Rs 40/bag month-on-month in the South and Rs 20/bag month-on-month in the East. In the North, West, and Central regions, the average increase ranged between Rs 8–15/bag. ALSO READ: Buy UltraTech Cement; target of Rs 13,000: Sharekhan ""The price hikes should alleviate the concern of lower margin for the past few quarters. We estimate that the cement spreads in April 2025 should be at a 17-month high, mainly led by price hikes,"" they added. In their Q4FY25 earnings preview, analysts expect sequential profitability to improve, supported by the sustained price hike from December 2024, positive operating leverage, and more favourable fuel prices. However, EBITDA per tonne is still projected to be lower on a year-on-year basis, as the recent price hikes were not sufficient to fully recover from the earlier fall in cement prices. ""While we are structurally positive on the sector, we prefer players with a balanced geographic mix, higher capacity utilisation, and a strong track record of capacity expansion and successful integration,"" they noted, citing a preference for Ultratech Cement among largecaps and JK Cement within the midcaps.

However, the near-term impact is limited due to the pre-duty stocking. China’s continued access to SEZ markets and ongoing MIPA competition may partially offset the benefits. AACL is diversifying its product mix to reduce reliance on any single offering while expanding capacity through debottlenecking, a new Ethylamine plant, and repurposing assets for Methylamines. It faces competition, especially from Chinese players and domestic peers, but aims to maintain an edge through efficiency and quality. Outlook AACL expanded aliphatic amines capacity by ~30% in FY24 and is focusing on margin-accretive specialty products despite near-term demand headwinds. With a projected 15% revenue and 20% EPS CAGR over FY25–27, risks include intense competition and pricing pressure, while the recent ADD implementation could offer potential upside.

After Trump made his 'Liberation Day' announcement and unveiled 26 percent tariff on India on April 2, Indian stock markets strongly reacted, accompanying global peers. Sensex crashed over 2,000 points on April 7, while Nifty plunged over 4 percent.

The move, which Trump framed as a response to outreach from over 75 nations seeking talks, was enough to flip investor sentiment overnight. The S&P 500 soared 8 percent, the Dow Jones jumped 2,300 points or 7 percent, and the Nasdaq also rose a massive 10 percent. While the tariff relief was limited to select countries, Trump turned the heat up on China, hiking tariffs on its imports to 125 percent with immediate effect. Despite the US-China tension, the broader relief rally appears to have taken hold for the time being. Furthermore, RBI's decision to cut interest rates for a second time in a row will also play its part on April 11 when markets resume after the Mahavir Jayanti holiday on April 10. ""The RBI has signalled a decisive pivot towards growth. With inflation expectations anchored—FY26 CPI forecast now revised lower to 4 percent—the central bank has found room to support demand without risking macro stability,"" said Anirudh Garg, Partner and Fund Manager at Invasset PMS. VK Vijayakumar of Geojit Financial Services said that India is likely to be among the least impacted large economies in this “Trump shakeout.” The sharp drop in crude oil prices is also a positive for India. In today's session, benchmark indices Nifty and Sensex continued to trade with steep losses on April 9, dragged down by a sharp fall in IT, metal, pharma and PSU bank stocks. The broader market reflected the weak mood, with midcap and smallcap indices falling 0.5 percent and 0.9 percent, respectively. Analysts remain wary of the space, as valuations still haven’t eased.

Wall Street stages comeback as Trump says 'remain calm' despite fresh tariff shocks from China and EU,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-war-flares-up-sends-dow-jones-s-p500-sliding-as-china-hits-back-tech-stocks-lift-nasdaq-12990197.html,"Wall Street clawed back early losses on Wednesday, with major indexes inching higher despite a fresh wave of tariff-related jitters that rattled markets at the open. The S&P 500 rose 0.5 percent, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite led the rebound with a 1.31 percent gain. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 90 points, or 0.3 percent, after falling sharply at the start of the session. Also read: RBI issues draft guidelines on gold loan, aims to put in place a 'harmonised' framework Adding to the effort to soothe nerves, President Donald Trump took to Truth Social shortly after the opening, urging investors to “remain calm,” calling it “a great time to buy.” The bounce came even as trade tensions deepened. China announced an 84 percent tariff on U.S. goods, set to take effect Thursday. The move came hours after Washington’s own 104 percent levy on Chinese imports kicked in just after midnight, marking another sharp turn in the ongoing standoff between the world’s two largest economies. Adding to the pressure, the European Union approved its first wave of retaliatory tariffs against the U.S., in response to Washington’s steel and aluminum duties. The measures — set to take effect April 15 — target a broad range of American goods and were cleared by all 27 member states. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned that a recession was now a ""likely outcome"" of the tariff conflict. The pressure was visible in the auto sector. Shares of Ford dropped over 2 percent, while General Motors fell 1 percent.

Bond markets also reflected the strain, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury spiking to 4.37 percent — more than 10 basis points higher on the day — after dipping below 4 percent earlier in the week. Given the widespread tension, European markets slumped on Wednesday, wiping out the previous session’s gains as U.S. tariffs targeting specific countries kicked in, jolting investor sentiment across the region. The pan-European Stoxx 600 tumbled 4 percent by 1:50 p.m. in London, with a sea of red across all sectors and major indices.

The steelmaker has formally begun consultations with its Central Works Council and informed trade unions about the proposed reorganisation. The restructuring comes at a time when the company is grappling with weak demand across Europe, geopolitical disruptions, and elevated energy costs that have hurt profitability. While production has recovered to near full capacity in FY25 at 6.75 million tonnes, Tata Steel said cost pressures continue to weigh on its financial performance. Also read: Sensex ends 400 pts lower, Nifty below 22,400 as tariff jitters outweigh RBI's rate cut; FMCG stocks shine To address this, Tata Steel Nederland is rolling out a multi-pronged strategy to cut fixed costs, improve production efficiency, and realign its product portfolio. A key part of the overhaul includes simplifying the organisational structure—eliminating duplications, increasing accountability, and embracing automation. Changes to the local management board are also on the cards. The company said it will engage in a comprehensive consultation process over the next few weeks to finalise the plan. Beyond immediate cost rationalisation, Tata Steel Nederland is positioning itself for a long-term pivot to cleaner production. It plans to replace one of the two blast furnaces at its IJmuiden plant with a Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) unit and Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) by the end of this decade, which could cut CO₂ emissions by around 5 million tonnes annually. The IJmuiden facility, with its deep-sea port and proximity to major customers, is considered one of Europe’s best-positioned plants for a transition to green steel, especially given access to offshore wind energy and existing infrastructure.

IDBI Bank shares rise after DIPAM Secy says disinvestment progressing steadily,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/idbi-bank-shares-rise-after-dipam-secy-says-disinvestment-progressing-steadily-12989540.html,"The government’s long-awaited disinvestment of IDBI Bank is progressing steadily, with several critical steps now underway, DIPAM Secretary Arunish Chawla has said. Shares of IDBI Bank are sharply higher by over 3 percent on April 9. Speaking to CNBC-TV18 earlier this week, Chawla called the 'multi-stage' process as 'fairly complex', involving multiple workstreams moving in parallel. “The virtual data room is active, all the queries are being answered, we’re negotiating the shareholders’ agreement, and we’ve already appointed an asset valuer,” Chawla said, adding, “Everything is going forward like a parallel computer.” DIPAM Secretary refrained from giving a definitive timeline, but hinted that the deal could close in the first half of FY26. In response to a question over a possible H1FY26 timeline, he said, “Fingers crossed, we are hopeful.” Read More: IDBI Bank stake sale on track, final decision in 3-4 months: DIPAM Secretary Speculation has swirled around the interested parties for the asset, however, Chawla has declined to comment on the identities of any potential bidders. “We do not comment on potential bidders,” he said. DIPAM Secretary is keen that fund managers should include PSU stocks in their portfolios, and according to some reports, officials of divestment department are slated to meet mutual funds in Mumbai next week. The IDBI Bank disinvestment is a critical test case for the government’s strategic disinvestment policy, which aims to reduce its stake in non-strategic public sector enterprises while attracting long-term private capital. The Centre and LIC currently hold a combined 94.72% stake in the bank, with plans to divest a majority stake to a strategic buyer. The transaction had initially been expected to close by FY24-end, but complexities around valuation, regulatory clearances, and bidder due diligence have led to delays. The Government of India and LIC together aim to divest a 61% stake in IDBI Bank, comprising 30.48% held by the Centre and 30.24% by LIC. The disinvestment process formally began in January 2023 with the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) inviting Expressions of Interest (EoIs). Following this, the names of interested bidders were forwarded to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for due diligence. Once regulatory clearance was secured, shortlisted bidders were granted access to IDBI Bank’s virtual data room for further evaluation.

The shares of the company were trading at Rs 1,353 apiece. The USFDA enforcement order said that the recall was a voluntary one, issued by the firm itself on March 13 this year. The recall falls under the agency's Class II category, which means that the use of the products may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences. Such drugs however are not likely to cause serious adverse health consequences. The shares of the company have now extended losses for the fourth consecutive session. The pharma giant has seen a strong downturn in its share price recently, falling over 13 percent in the last five sessions. The fall in the share price accompanies its peer stocks, as US President Donald Trump continues to threaten tariffs on pharmaceuticals. US President Donald Trump, on Wednesday, said his administration would soon announce a “major” tariff on pharmaceutical imports, aimed at encouraging drug manufacturers to shift operations back to the US.

Management indicated that demand remains strong for cables, led by an increase in government capex activities. The demand for wires has also improved, supported by an improvement in real estate demand and higher copper prices, which are encouraging inventory stocking. The company has maintained its revenue growth target of ~18% in FY25E/26E and ~20% in FY27E. With rising demand from power transmission, industrial infrastructure, real estate, and data centers, KEII is strengthening its manufacturing capabilities through brownfield expansions and a new greenfield facility in Sanand, Gujarat. The company is also enhancing its backward integration efforts to improve cost efficiency and supply security.

FMCG's domestic focus attracts investors as Trump tariffs make markets volatile,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/fmcgs-domestic-focus-attracts-investors-as-trump-tariffs-make-markets-volatile-12989509.html,"Shares of FMCG companies recorded strong gains on April 9, supported by index heavyweights ITC, HUL and Nestle India, pushing Nifty FMCG index higher by nearly 2 percent as the biggest sectoral gainer, while the broader market trend remains weak. Nestle India and Godrej Consumer Products shares were the top gainers on the FMCG index, rising over 3 percent, with Britannia Industries, Emami, Hindustan Unilever and Colgate Palmolive following in tow. Marico, United Spirits, Tata Consumer and Dabur shares closed 1-2 percent higher, while ITC, United Breweries and Patanjali Foods closed with marginal gains. Varun Beverages and Radico Khaitan shares however bucked the trend to trade in the red with marginal losses. Jyothy Labs shares also recorded strong gains, closing nearly 8 percent higher at Rs 370 apiece. The FMCG sector's defensive nature and domestic demand makes it an attractive bet for investors amid times of uncertainties, especially at a time when the markets are turning volatile owing to US President Trump's reciprocal tariffs triggering a trade war and recession fears. Additionally, RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra on April 9 announced that the central bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has reduced its Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation projection to 4 percent from its earlier 4.2 percent for FY26. RBI also cut its repo rate by 25 bps to 6 percent. Narinder Wadhwa, Managing Director & CEO of SKI Capital said, ""From a macroeconomic perspective, a rate cut could put downward pressure on the rupee, particularly if foreign investors continue pulling out of emerging markets. A weaker rupee, while supportive for IT and pharma exports, may also stoke imported inflation…Export-heavy sectors like manufacturing may see mixed effects: domestic easing may help margins, but global trade disruptions could reduce orders. Defensive sectors like FMCG might again gain favour if volatility remains elevated."" Sankar Chakraborti, MD & CEO of Acuité Ratings & Research said, ""The MPC's decision to front-load support to domestic growth, especially for our domestic growth drivers, which might be affected by tariffs such as the MSMEs, is a welcome move. By leaning into the window of disinflation, the RBI is aiming to cushion the economy from external shocks and sustain the momentum in consumption and investment recovery.""

"Experts bullish on these top 9 rate-sensitive stocks after RBI cuts repo rate, inflation forecast",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/experts-bullish-on-these-top-9-rate-sensitive-stocks-after-rbi-cuts-repo-rate-inflation-forecast-12989531.html,"The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI's) monetary policy committee (MPC) on April 9 unanimously decided to reduce the repo rate by 25 basis points to 6 percent, while changing the policy stance from neutral to accommodative. The central bank also announced a cut in its full-year growth forecast for FY26 to 6.5 percent due to a tariff-led uncertainty in the global economy. This is the second consecutive repo rate cut, considering that the inflation has moved below target. With expectations of durable softening in food inflation, fall in crude oil prices, and assuming a normal monsoon, the RBI has lowered its inflation forecast to 4 percent for FY26, from 4.2 percent earlier. The Reserve Bank also reduced its estimates for Q1FY26 to 3.6 percent (from 4.5 percent) and Q2FY26 to 3.9 percent (from 4 percent). In February, the CPI inflation eased to 7-month low of 3.61 percent. However, ""the rapidly evolving situation requires continuous monitoring and assessment of the economic outlook,"" the central bank noted. It believes headwinds from global trade disruptions continue to pose downward risks with worries over merchandise exports, though domestic demand and supply situation remains strong. Hence, the central bank has reduced its FY26 as well as Q1FY26 GDP growth forecast to 6.5 percent from 6.7 percent earlier. According to experts, the rate cut was on expected lines but change in stance was unexpected. They see more rate cuts in the coming policy meetings. ""The accommodative stance is a positive signal to the industry. The RBI has cautiously outlined a strong growth path by maintaining the expected GDP growth rate at 6.5 percent. Inflation continues to moderate with oil prices lowering and food inflation sharply reducing, paving the way for further cuts,"" Vineet Agrawal, co - founder at Jiraaf said. He expects the RBI to further cut rates by additional 50-75 bps in the remaining calendar year. Amidst global uncertainty, RBI is taking strong measures to protect growth and counterbalancing uncertainty, he Agrawal said. The market traded lower after the announcement of the RBI policy, likely due to profit booking as most of the announcements, barring change in policy stance, are in line with expectations, while the volatility remained on the higher side due to tariff-led uncertainty. The Nifty 50 fell 113 points to 22,423 and the Bank Nifty declined 379 points to 50,132 amid volatility, at 12:08 hours IST. ""While the domestic economy remains resilient on many fronts, the external environment is anything but predictable—and policy navigation will need to remain flexible and responsive. Going ahead, markets are expected to remain volatile till the tariff-related dust settles,"" Apurva Sheth, head of market perspectives & research at Samco Securities said. The India VIX, the fear gauge, increased by 3.5 percent to 21.16 levels, making the bulls more cautious. Moneycontrol collated a list of top 9 rate sensitive stocks from experts with short term perspective. The stock price of April 8 is considered for the calculation of returns: Hardik Matalia, Derivative Analyst at Choice Broking Bajaj Finserv | CMP: Rs 1,903.2 Bajaj Finserv is maintaining an upward trajectory within a rising parallel channel on the daily timeframe. The stock has been forming a pattern of higher highs and higher lows, indicating sustained bullish sentiment. This structure suggests continued strength, with the price respecting both channel boundaries. Recently, the stock bounced from the lower range of the channel, signaling a potential continuation of the trend. Technically, Bajaj Finserv has rebounded from its medium-term EMA (50-day) and has moved above its short-term EMA (20-day). This indicates that short-term buying interest is gaining strength, adding to the positive sentiment. On the price action front, a continuation within the channel could push the stock toward the next significant resistance level around Rs 2,100, which aligns with the upper boundary of the channel and previous supply zones. The increasing momentum and moving average alignment provide further confidence in the potential upmove. Considering the technical setup, buying Bajaj Finserv at the current market price (CMP) is recommended, with a stop-loss at Rs 1,815 to manage downside risk. This setup offers a favourable risk-reward ratio, targeting Rs 2,100 in the near term, assuming the trend remains intact and supported by market momentum. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,100 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,815 Bank of Baroda | CMP: Rs 235.84 Bank of Baroda recently staged a strong reversal after a breakdown from a wide consolidation range. The stock found support at lower levels, leading to notable buying interest and a sharp recovery. This recovery has taken shape into a rounding bottom pattern on the daily timeframe—a bullish reversal pattern that signals a shift from weakness to strength. The stock is now approaching a crucial level, with a potential breakout above Rs 242 likely to trigger the next phase of upside. A successful and sustained move above this resistance zone could open the path for a rally toward the next key target at Rs 265, aligning with previous swing highs and pattern projections. Momentum indicators support this bullish setup. Technically, Bank of Baroda has rebounded from its short-term and medium-term EMAs and has successfully surpassed its long-term EMA (200-day). This alignment of moving averages typically points to a shift in the trend's direction and adds conviction to the bullish scenario. Considering the overall setup, buying Bank of Baroda at the CMP is advisable, with a stop-loss placed at Rs 221 to manage downside risk. A breakout above Rs 242 will confirm the pattern and set the stage for an upside move toward Rs 265, offering a favourable risk-reward opportunity. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 265 Stop-Loss: Rs 221 Bajaj Finance | CMP: Rs 8,822.25 Bajaj Finance is maintaining its position within a long-term uptrend. After a strong rally, the stock has entered a consolidation phase near higher levels, which is often seen as a healthy pause before the next leg up. Importantly, within this range, the stock has been forming higher lows, indicating underlying strength and sustained buying interest. The current price structure is showing signs of preparation for an upward breakout, with bullish momentum building steadily. A decisive move above the key Rs 9,000 mark could act as a trigger for the next rally, potentially pushing the stock toward the upside target of Rs 9,700. This level aligns with the upper boundary of the price projection based on previous moves. From a moving average perspective, Bajaj Finance has bounced from its medium-term EMA (50-day) and has also surpassed its short-term EMA (20-day). This alignment indicates growing bullish sentiment and adds weight to the expectation of a breakout. Given the strong technical foundation, buying Bajaj Finance at the CMP is advisable, with a stop-loss set at Rs 8,350 to limit downside risk. A breakout above Rs 9,000 could pave the way for a sustained rally toward Rs 9,700, offering an attractive risk-reward opportunity. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 9,700 Stop-Loss: Rs 8,350 Chandan Taparia, Head Derivatives & Technicals, Wealth Management at Motilal Oswal Financial Services HDFC Bank | CMP: Rs 1,769.15 HDFC Bank is retesting its breakout from a consolidation zone and holding at the 50-day EMA support level. The stochastic indicator has exited its oversold zones, confirming positive sentiment. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,835 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,740 State Bank of India | CMP: Rs 768.6 State Bank of India has formed a pole-and-flag pattern on the daily scale, which is a bullish continuation indication. The ADX (Average Directional Index) line is rising, which confirms the strength of the trend. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 815 Stop-Loss: Rs 745 Om Mehra, Technical Research Analyst at Samco Securities Canara Bank | CMP: Rs 89.43 Canara Bank is trading above the 20 and 50-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) but remains below the 100-day EMA. The daily RSI hovers around the 55-mark, indicating improving momentum. Additionally, the MACD is holding above the signal line, hinting at a potential positive crossover. The volume expansion alongside price stability near support further suggests accumulation at lower levels. The stock looks favourable for a ""buy on dips"" approach. Hence, based on the technical structure, one can initiate a long position at the CMP for a target price of Rs 98. The stop-loss can be kept at Rs 85. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 98 Stop-Loss: Rs 85 Vidnyan S Sawant, Head of Research at GEPL Capital Manappuram Finance | CMP: Rs 229.06 Manappuram Finance has shown notable strength since December 2024, particularly on the weekly chart, where it has demonstrated a clear polarity shift—the July 2024 resistance zone (Rs 222–228) now acts as a strong support area. The stock is trading firmly above both the 12-week and 26-week EMAs, reinforcing the bullish trend. On the daily timeframe, the stock has exhibited a bullish mean reversion from the 26-day EMA, indicating renewed buying interest and increasing the probability of an upward continuation in the near term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 258 Stop-Loss: Rs 217 Cholamandalam Financial Holdings | CMP: Rs 1,718.45 Cholamandalam Financial Holdings continues to exhibit a strong long-term bullish structure on the monthly timeframe, maintaining a pattern of higher highs and higher lows. The stock is well-supported above the key 12-month and 26-month EMAs, reaffirming its bullish trend. On the weekly chart, the stock has shown renewed buying interest around the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the prior uptrend from Rs 1,033 to Rs 2,154, signaling a potential resumption of the upward move. Despite prevailing market volatility, the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) remains in buy mode on the weekly scale, and the current week's price action reflects sustained momentum and strong relative strength, indicating underlying resilience. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,011 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,615 Shriram Finance | CMP: Rs 641.45 Shriram Finance continues to exhibit a robust price structure across higher timeframes, consistently sustaining its uptrend. Throughout this rising trend, dips have been bought near the 12-month EMA, reflecting a healthy bullish mean reversion and strong long-term momentum. On the weekly chart, the stock has formed a bullish candlestick pattern and attracted buying interest near the 26-week EMA. Additionally, the MACD remains in buy mode, signaling sustained momentum and supporting the case for further upside.

The logistics service provider on April 5 had acquired a controlling stake in rival Ecom Express for approximately Rs 1,400 crore, sending the shares higher by over 3 percent on April 7. However, the stock tumbled 7 percent on April 8 to erase all gains recorded in the previous session, and extended the selloff on April 9, pushing the stock down over a percent. Emkay Global’s note said that despite the scale benefits for Delhivery post acquisition, there are significant costs that need to be addressed over 12-18 months. ""Improvement in network utilization…should aid profitability in our view, once networks are integrated. While valuations are fairly attractive, the acquisition is unlikely to be earnings accretive in the near term. With majority of customers being common between the two and given the learnings from the Spoton acquisition, we expect sales retention and network integration to be relatively smooth."" Emkay said there are concerns around online shopping platform Meesho, which partners with Delhivery but now plans to increase insourcing of logistics, would continue to cast a shadow on the volume trajectory in the near term. Emkay has retained its ‘Buy’ call on Delhivery but slashed the target price to Rs 400 apiece, implying an upside potential of nearly 61 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. Delhivery shares had made a muted debut on stock markets at Rs 493 apiece in May 2022. The stock has now crashed over 50 percent from that level.

The note downgraded TCS, Wipro and Mphasis and lowered the earnings per share (EPS) estimates for the stocks under coverage by 2 to 14 percent, with Infosys, Coforge and Sagility among its preferred picks. Jefferies said it favours stocks with higher growth visibility amid tariff-related uncertainty, adding that the IT sector is unlikely to get a re-rating unless the outlook for the US GDP improves. Jefferies on TCS The international brokerage downgraded its rating for Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) from 'Buy' to 'Hold' and cut the target from Rs 4,530 per share to Rs 3,300 per share.

It slashed the stock's target price from Rs 3,250 per share to Rs 2,300 per share. This however implies an upside potential of over 6 percent from the stock's previous closing price. Mphasis shares plunged nearly 3 percent to close at Rs 2,109 apiece. Jefferies on Infosys, Coforge and Sagility Although Jefferies had a 'Buy' call on the shares of Infosys, Coforge and Sagility, it cut the target prices them. The brokerage cut its target price for Infosys to Rs 1,700 apiece from the earlier Rs 1,835 per share. The latest target price implies an upside potential of nearly 19 percent from the stock’s previous closing price.

"Tata Steel, JSW Steel, other metal stocks slip up to 3% after 104% tariff escalates US-China trade tensions",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/metal-stocks-likely-to-be-under-pressure-after-104-tariff-escalates-us-china-trade-tensions-12989199.html,"Nifty Metal index slipped over 1.5 percent on April 9, following US President Donald Trump’s announcement of a sweeping 104 percent tariff on Chinese goods. This sharp escalation comes in response to retaliatory measures taken by China and marks a significant increase from Trump’s previous tariff levels. Among individual counters, shares of JSW Steel, Tata Steel, Hindalco, and Hindustan Zinc saw declines of up to 2 percent on April 9. Over the last four trading sessions, the Nifty Metal index has recorded a steep decline of 11 percent, driven by rising fears of a global economic slowdown. Individual stocks such as Tata Steel, JSW Steel, SAIL, NALCO, and others have seen losses of up to 15 percent during the same period. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog Until last month, the US had maintained a tariff rate of 10 percent on Chinese imports. However, this rate surged to 44 percent after President Trump introduced a set of “reciprocal tariffs,” including an additional 34 percent on Chinese goods and a blanket 10 percent base tariff on all other countries. These changes pushed the total tariff burden on Chinese imports to 54 percent. After China responded with a 34 percent tariff on US goods, the United States retaliated once again by slapping an extra 50 percent tariff on Chinese imports, bringing the cumulative tariff rate to an unprecedented 104 percent. President Trump’s decision to enforce stricter trade measures against China—widely recognised as the world’s second-largest economy and a major producer and consumer of base metals—has raised fresh concerns over the fragility of China's post-pandemic economic recovery. Many fear that these aggressive tariffs could further derail China’s growth trajectory. Experts warned that the escalating trade conflict between the world’s two largest economies, which together account for around 45 percent of global GDP, could severely impact global growth and trade flows in the coming quarters, which could put more pressure on global metal prices. “Rising trade tariffs have significantly increased the risk of supply chain bottlenecks, elevated inflation levels, and a broader slowdown in global economic activity—all of which have put downward pressure on commodity prices,” noted analysts at Prabhudas Lilladher. “Going forward, it will be critical to monitor the extent of the global economic slowdown, the resilience of domestic demand, and whether inflation in input costs continues to be driven by disruptions in global supply chains.” Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Senco Gold shares hit 5% upper circuit as it posts highest-ever revenue in Q4 update,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/senco-gold-shares-in-focus-as-it-posts-higher-ever-revenue-in-q4-update-12989182.html,"Shares of Senco Gold were locked at 5 percent upper circuit at Rs 317 apiece on April 9, following the company’s release of a robust business update for the March quarter. So far this year, the jewellery maker’s stock has seen a sharp decline of over 46 percent. This drop stands in contrast to the benchmark Nifty 50 index, which has slipped by around 5 percent during the same period. Stay tuned to our LIVE blog for all the latest market developments In its fourth-quarter update, Senco Gold reported a solid 19.1 percent year-on-year (YoY) increase in revenue, clocking its highest-ever revenue for a fourth quarter at over Rs 1,300 crore. For the full fiscal year, the company’s top-line figure crossed Rs 6,200 crore, marking a healthy 19.4 percent growth in retail business. The company attributed this growth to a strong boost in wedding and festive demand during the quarter, which drove higher foot traffic across stores and an uptick in customer invoices. Same-store sales growth stood at 18.4 percent for the quarter, and at 14.6 percent for the full fiscal year. Notably, revenue growth from Tier 3 and Tier 4 towns outpaced that of metro cities and Tier 2 locations, showcasing the rising demand in smaller markets. Sales of coins and bullion continued to form a relatively minor portion of overall gold sales, accounting for less than 4 percent. Meanwhile, the company’s revenue from regions outside the eastern part of India saw a 23 percent jump in 2025, reaching Rs 1,100 crore, up from Rs 940 crore in the financial year 2024. Senco Gold also reported an impressive 39 percent growth in diamond jewellery sales. In addition, the stud ratio—representing the proportion of studded jewellery sold—improved slightly, rising to 10.9 percent from 10.5 percent. During the fourth quarter, the company expanded its retail footprint by launching four new showrooms under both the Franchisee and Company-Owned Company-Operated (COCO) models in the states of West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh. In total, the company has inaugurated 15 new showrooms in fiscal year 2025 so far, six of which are franchise-run. With these additions, Senco Gold now operates a total of 175 showrooms, including one international outlet in Dubai.

Track the latest updates on GIFT Nifty right here on Moneycontrol.

At close, the Sensex was up 1,089.18 points or 1.49 percent at 74,227.08, and the Nifty was up 374.25 points or 1.69 percent at 22,535.85.

US Equities (Down) The S&P 500 sold off sharply on Tuesday to close below 5,000 points for the first time in almost a year after it reversed a strong morning rally, while investor hopes faded for any imminent U.S. delays or concessions on tariffs ahead of a midnight deadline. The S&P 500 has lost $5.83 trillion in market value, for its steepest four days of losses since the index was created in the 1950s, following President Donald Trump unveiling of hefty global tariffs against U.S. trading partners late on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 320.01 points, or 0.84%, to close at 37,645.59, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 335.35 points, or 2.15%, to end at 15,267.91.

Wall Street slides again as US forges ahead with 104% tariffs on China,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/wall-street-slides-again-as-us-forges-ahead-with-104-tariffs-on-china-12989137.html,"The United States said on Tuesday that 104% duties on imports from China will take effect shortly after midnight, even as the Trump administration moved to quickly start talks with other trading partners targeted by President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff plan. U.S. stocks dropped on Tuesday for a fourth straight trading day since Trump's tariffs announcement last week, with the S&P 500 closing below 5,000 for the first time in almost a year. The index is now 18.9% below its most recent high on February 19, close to the 20% decline that defines a bear market. S&P 500 companies have lost $5.8 trillion in stock market value since Trump's tariff announcement last Wednesday, the deepest four-day loss since the benchmark was created in the 1950s, according to LSEG data. Global markets had previously posted gains on hopes that Trump might be willing to negotiate down the array of country and product-specific trade barriers he is erecting around the world's largest consumer market. The administration has scheduled talks with South Korea and Japan, two close allies and major trading partners, and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is due to visit next week. ""These are tailored, highly tailored deals,"" Trump said at a White House event, where he signed executive orders aimed at boosting coal production. ""We've had talks with many, many countries, over 70, they all want to come in. Our problem is, can't see that many that fast."" But the White House made clear that country-specific tariffs of up to 50% would nevertheless take effect at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time (0401 GMT), as planned. Those tariffs will be especially steep for China, as Trump has ratcheted up duties on its imports to 104% in response to countertariffs Beijing announced last week. China has refused to bow to what it called blackmail and has vowed to fight to the end. Administration officials said they would not prioritize negotiations with the world's No. 2 economic power. Trump's sweeping tariffs have raised fears of recession and upended a global trading order that has been in place for decades. ""Right now, we've received the instruction to prioritize our allies and our trading partners like Japan and Korea and others,"" White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said on Fox News. Trump's tailor-made approach to negotiations with individual countries could take into account foreign and military aid as well as economic factors, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said. Trump's lead trade negotiator, Jamieson Greer, told Congress that his office is trying to work quickly but is not facing a particular deadline. ""The president has been clear, again, that he's not doing exemptions or exceptions in the near term,"" Greer told lawmakers. China is bracing for a war of attrition, and manufacturers are warning about profits and scrambling to plan new overseas plants. Citing rising external risks, Citi cut its 2025 China GDP growth forecast to 4.2% from 4.7%. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said his country's 25% tariff on some vehicles - a countermeasure to match Trump's approach - will take effect immediately after midnight. ""President Trump caused this trade crisis — and Canada is responding with purpose and with force,"" Carney said on X. Canada and Mexico were exempt from the new round of tariffs Trump announced last week, but previous levies remained in place. Most goods that comply with the existing trade agreement between the three countries are not subject to those tariffs. AMERICANS WORRIED ABOUT PRICES Three out of four Americans expect prices to rise as Trump's tariffs kick in, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll. Chipmaker Micron told customers it will impose a tariff-related surcharge starting on Wednesday, while U.S. clothing retailers said they are delaying orders and holding off on hiring. Running shoes made in Vietnam that now retail for $155 will cost $220 when Trump's 46% tariff on that country takes effect, according to an industry group. Consumers are stocking up while they can. ""I'm buying double of whatever - beans, canned goods, flour, you name it,"" Thomas Jennings, 53, said as he pushed a shopping cart through the aisles of a New Jersey Walmart. The market slide has prompted some business leaders, including those close to Trump, to urge the president to reverse course. Global oil prices steadied after falling to four-year lows. The European Commission, meanwhile, is mulling countertariffs of 25% on a range of U.S. goods, including soybeans, nuts and sausages, though other potential items like bourbon whiskey were left off the list. Officials said they stood ready to negotiate. The 27-member bloc is struggling with tariffs on autos and metals already in place, and faces a 20% tariff on other products on Wednesday. Trump has also threatened to impose tariffs on EU alcoholic drinks. European pharma companies, also fearful of the tariff fallout, warned the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, in a meeting that Trump's tariffs would expedite the industry's shift away from Europe and toward the United States.","The United States said on Tuesday that 104% duties on imports from China will take effect shortly after midnight, even as the Trump administration moved to quickly start talks with other trading partners targeted by President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff plan.","The United States said on Tuesday that 104% duties on imports from China will take effect shortly after midnight, even as the Trump administration moved to quickly start talks with other trading partners targeted by President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff plan.",Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said his country's 25% tariff on some vehicles - a countermeasure to match Trump's approach - will take effect immediately after midnight.,"European pharma companies, also fearful of the tariff fallout, warned the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, in a meeting that Trump's tariffs would expedite the industry's shift away from Europe and toward the United States."

The market breadth also turned positive, with about 2,201 shares advancing against 371 declining shares on the NSE. Volatility is likely to remain high, and consolidation is expected to continue until the index closes the bearish gap of April 7. Below are some trading ideas for the near term: Amol Athawale, VP-Technical Research at Kotak Securities SBI Life Insurance Company | CMP: Rs 1,488 After the sharp up moves, SBI Life Insurance witnessed profit booking at higher levels. Post the recent selloff in the counter, the downward momentum has stopped. On the daily charts, the counter has found support near its important retracement zone. The formation suggests a revival of the uptrend from the current levels in the coming horizon. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,590 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,440 Nestle India | CMP: Rs 2,275.4 Nestle India is in the accumulation zone, where it is trading in a rangebound mode on the daily scale. However, recent bullish activity near the breakout zone of the range indicates good strength. The counter is expected to break out and witness a fresh uptrend from the current levels, offering a favourable risk-reward perspective. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,440 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,200 Chambal Fertilisers and Chemicals | CMP: Rs 631.65 After the remarkable up move, Chambal Fertilisers is taking a breather in the last few sessions. The consolidation in the rangebound structure suggests a bullish continuation chart formation. Moreover, the stock comfortably closed above its short-term moving average. Therefore, the stock is likely to resume its uptrend from the current levels in the near term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 680 Stop-Loss: Rs 610 Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors Pidilite Industries | CMP: Rs 2,930.95 On Monday's session, when all the global markets experienced a bloodbath due to negative global cues and fears over recession, Pidilite Industries did not fall as much in comparison to other stocks. In the previous session, prices surged by nearly 3%, which is a positive sign. Moreover, prices took support at the mid Bollinger bands and gained more than 5%, which is also a positive sign. The stock is moving within a downward sloping channel and is currently trading at the resistance of the channel. A breakout of it is needed for bullish momentum to continue. Also, prices have retraced exactly 38.2% of the fall that started in September 2024. For now, we expect prices to retrace up to 50% of the fall, which is also near its previous swing high of Rs 3,010 levels. In summary, the current trend for Pidilite Industries looks to be positive. A break above Rs 2,950 levels can lead to a trending move towards Rs 3,070, followed by Rs 3,185 levels. On the downside, Rs 2,830 levels is the nearest support to watch out for. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,070, Rs 3,185 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,830 Indus Towers | CMP: Rs 370.65 In the previous session, Indus Towers managed to outshine its sector and surged by more than 4%, which is a bullish sign. Moreover, the stock has been consolidating within a broader range of Rs 312-390 levels. For now, a break above Rs 375 can result in a move towards the upper end of the range, which is at Rs 390 levels, followed by Rs 405. On the daily chart, prices recently found support at the baseline (red line) of the Ichimoku cloud indicator and reversed to the upside, which is a bullish sign. Also, the RSI is trading at 65, which gives prices the space to trend further. On the downside, Rs 355 is the nearest support. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 390, Rs 405 Stop-Loss: Rs 355 Rainbow Children's Medicare | CMP: Rs 1,479.65 In the previous session, Rainbow Children's Medicare closed with a massive gain of 5.26% and also managed to close above the prior day's high. The stock has been witnessing a rounding bottom pattern since January 2025. Currently, prices are trading near its neckline at Rs 1,490 levels. A daily close above Rs 1,490 will confirm the breakout of the said pattern. If this happens, a fresh course of rise can be expected in this stock. On the daily chart, the ADX (Average Directional Index) is trading above 25 at 28, suggesting strong momentum to continue in the stock. In summary, the trend for Rainbow is bullish. A break above Rs 1,490 is a must for positive momentum to continue, with the target at Rs 1,610. On the downside, the nearest support is at Rs 1,420. Strategy: buy Target: Rs 1,610 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,420 Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities ICICI Prudential Life Insurance | CMP: Rs 557 The downward correction of the last couple of weeks seems to have completed in this insurance stock. ICICI Prudential Life Insurance has moved up after the formation of a slightly lower bottom on the daily chart. We observe a double-bottom type formation (not a classical one) on the daily/weekly chart. A positive divergence pattern has started to form in the stock price and in RSI as per the daily and weekly timeframe charts. Volume has started to expand during the upside breakout in the stock price, and the weekly 14-period RSI shows positive indications. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 610 Stop-Loss: Rs 530 CreditAccess Grameen | CMP: Rs 996.55 The weekly timeframe chart of CreditAccess Grameen indicates a formation of a larger consolidation movement in the last few months. The stock price is now placed at the edge of breaking above the triangle-type formation around Rs 1,020 levels. The overall weekly chart pattern indicates the formation of a crucial bottom reversal pattern. Weekly momentum oscillators signal a positive bias. The overall chart pattern of CreditAccess Grameen indicates a long trading opportunity. One may look to create a positional buy as per the levels mentioned. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,105 Stop-Loss: Rs 945 UNO Minda | CMP: Rs 837.3 The sharp downtrend of the last two weeks seems to be over. UNO Minda has bounced back from the lows of Rs 767 levels recently. The current chart pattern indicates the formation of a lower-bottom reversal pattern.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rebounded 720 points, or 2 percent, after plunging more than 1,700 points during Monday’s wild session. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite each climbed 1.5 percent. Though the day’s rally cooled from its earlier highs, the strong gains offered a brief respite after one of the most volatile stretches in recent memory.

In a post on Truth Social, President Donald Trump said he had a ""great call"" with South Korea’s acting president and added that China ""also wants to make a deal badly."" The post came alongside a flurry of statements from U.S. officials suggesting that several countries were actively pursuing negotiations. CNBC reported that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said around 70 countries had reached out to the U.S. to initiate tariff talks. “If they come to the table with solid proposals, I think we can end up with some good deals,” he said, though he added that certain tariffs could remain as part of the final arrangements.

At close, the Sensex was up 1,089.18 points or 1.49 percent at 74,227.08, and the Nifty was up 374.25 points or 1.69 percent at 22,535.85. Nifty Auto, IT, Metal, Realty too snapped a three-day losing streak to rise between 1.2-2.5 percent. The BSE Midcap index rose 1.8 percent and Smallcap index added 2 percent. The gains on April 9 have resulted in investors' wealth rise by more than Rs 7 lakh crore, as the market capitalization of BSE-listed companies jumped to Rs 396 lakh crore, from Rs 390 lakh crore in the previous session. Overnight, the US stocks had ended lower on signs of the tariff spat escalating, after the European Union proposed counter-tariffs, while Trump threatened to add another 50% duty on US imports from China on Wednesday, if it did not withdraw its 34% retaliatory tariffs. Despite a weak handover from US, Asia bounced back to snap the slump sparked by concerns over President Trump’s tariff war. Going forward, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will most likely opt for a rate cut in its latest policy review on April 9. The liquidity situation in the banking system has improved, supporting growth, which may be facing downward risk due to the tariff impact, economists have said.

Outlook for April 9 Aditya Gaggar Director of Progressive Shares The combination of oversold condition and a strong recovery in global equities helped the Index begin the session on a positive note. Despite a short dip during the opening trade, Nifty50 managed to extend its gains, finishing the day higher at 22,535.85 with gains of 374.25 points. All sectors closed in the green, with Media and PSU Banks leading the way. With gains of over 2%, Mid and Small-cap stocks outperformed the Frontline Index. The Spinning Top candlestick pattern observed on the daily chart suggests indecisiveness between the bulls and bears. Under normal circumstances, the day’s high and low (22,700 and 22,270, respectively) would serve as immediate resistance and support levels. A breakout above or below these levels would signal a clear trend direction. Vaibhav Vidwani, Research Analyst at Bonanza Today, the Indian stock market rebounded strongly with the Sensex surging over 1,000 points to close at 74,227, and the Nifty 50 ending above 22,500. This recovery was driven by several factors, including positive global cues as Asian markets showed resilience and some easing of trade war fears as investors began to believe that the US-China trade tensions might not significantly impact other major economies. Hopes of a possible RBI rate cut to address liquidity challenges contributed to the upside. The market's fear gauge, India VIX, dropped significantly, indicating reduced investor anxiety. Market expectations remain cautiously optimistic, with investors awaiting clarity on global trade developments and the RBI's policy stance. Despite ongoing uncertainty, the stable macroeconomic fundamentals of India and fair valuations in large-cap stocks are expected to support the market in the long term. Overall, the market's ability to bounce back from significant losses suggests a robust underlying sentiment, though investors are likely to remain in a wait-and-watch mode until more clarity emerges on global trade tensions.

Countries including China, Canada, and the European Union have spoken about retaliatory tariffs on American goods, and the uncertainty around whether a settlement can be reached before the next phase of tariff hikes is causing widespread nervousness,"" Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Research and Wealth Management at Motilal Oswal said in a conversation with Moneycontrol. All sectoral indices traded in the green, with the battered Nifty IT index leading the rebound after suffering an 8 percent decline over the past five sessions. Tech majors such as TCS, Infosys, HCL Tech, and Wipro rose as much as 4 percent in the afternoon session, as the sector prepares to kick off its March-quarter earnings season in two days.

The broader market, represented by mid and small cap 100 indices, also mirrored positive trends with gains of 2.3 percent each. Despite the rebound, several market experts advised investors to maintain a cautious stance in the short term, citing continued uncertainty stemming from tariff-related tensions. Chetan Ahya, Chief Asia Economist at Morgan Stanley, remarked that India is unlikely to remain immune to the global slowdown triggered by escalating tariff wars. Speaking to CNBC-TV18, he stated, ""India could face a 40 to 50 basis point downside in GDP growth as a consequence of ongoing tariff tensions."" Shares of oil marketing companies (OMCs) such as Hindustan Petroleum Corp., Bharat Petroleum Corp., and Indian Oil Corp. surged in trade, lifted by the government's decision to raise the price of household LPG and the special excise duty on petrol and diesel. Oil companies are expected to recover around Rs 9,000 crore in FY26 through the Rs 50 hike in domestic LPG prices which will offset the ongoing losses, according to sources. Shares of Info Edge, the parent company of job search platform Naukri.com, surged nearly 5 percent on April 8 after the company reported a 19 percent rise in standalone billings during the January-March quarter of financial year 2025. The shares of the company were trading 4.5 percent higher at Rs 6,684 apiece in the afternoon. In an exchange filing, Info Edge reported standalone billings at Rs 983.8 crore in Q4FY25, higher than the Rs 826.9 crore reported in Q4FY24. The stocks of Electronics Manufacturing Services (EMS) firms in India rose about 9 percent on April 8 amid reports of Apple planning to source more iPhones from India to the US to beat the tariffs imposed on China. The Cupertino-based tech major is looking to implement the plan as a temporary measure to offset the high cost of imports due to the tariffs imposed on Beijing, the American daily Wall Street Journal reported. ""From a technical standpoint, the current market conditions appear quite troubling, as evidenced by the VIX spiking over 65 percent in just one day. This dramatic increase in volatility indicates significant uncertainty among investors,"" Sameet Chavan of Angel One said. ""On the support levels, we anticipate that 22,000-21,800 to serve as a cushion, helping to stabilize the market amid the heightened volatility. Nonetheless, any breach below this specified support level, in conjunction with the 'Downward Sloping Channel' identified on the daily chart, could potentially allow for a decline towards 21750-21400 in the forthcoming period,"" he added. Jio Financial Services, Shriram Finance, Titan Company, Cipla, and Bharat Electronics were the top gainers on the Nifty. Power Grid Corp was the only losers, ending marginally lower.

"Traders turn cautious as Trump tariff fears rattle Indian equities; options market reveals expectations of wild swings, low faith in upside break-out",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/traders-turn-cautious-as-trump-tariff-fears-rattle-indian-equities-12987871.html,"In the days following the Trump administration’s tariff announcements on April 2, the Indian derivatives market has mirrored the uncertainty that has gripped investors worldwide. With global volatility spiking and institutional flows turning cautious, traders have swiftly recalibrated their strategies—shifting towards safety, hedging aggressively, and betting on sharp swings instead of steady trends. Market participants say the current phase is far from business as usual. ""This uncertainty is going to linger till we know how other countries respond and what kind of trade dynamics emerge globally,"" Rajesh Palviya, Head of Technical and Derivatives Research at Axis Securities said in a conversation with Moneycontrol. Also read: We could already be seeing a Trump bottom, says Prashant Khemka To be sure, in April so far, FIIs have sold nearly 22,700 crore worth of stocks in the cash market. According to NSDL data, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) sold significantly more index futures than they bought since the start of April. They bought 93,958 contracts worth Rs 15,350 crore, but sold 1,50,025 contracts valued at Rs 24,921 crore. This reflects a bearish undertone indicating that while trading activity was high, FIIs could be positioning on the short side, possibly anticipating further market volatility or downside in the near term. Palviya attributes the recent sell-off to a mix of fear, global quantitative tightening, and weak macroeconomic signals. ""Everyone exited their positions because they didn’t know where this was heading,"" he says. ""India VIX, our volatility gauge, has surged over 60 percent, breaking out of a six-month range. Swings of 2 to 3 percent are now becoming the new normal."" The India VIX spiked nearly 66 percent yesterday to hit multi-month highs around the 23 mark. While there has been some cooling off today, Mishra points out that the index remains at elevated levels, reflecting a cautious market sentiment and the likelihood of sharp moves ahead. Read more: Macquarie's India playbook: 6 stars, 6 hitters, and 6 rising stocks Supporting this sentiment, Ajit Mishra, Senior Vice President at Religare Broking, says that the derivatives landscape is revealing more than just tactical moves—it's flashing a strong risk-off signal. ""FIIs had shown some buying interest in March, but post the tariff shock, they’ve gone back to selling,"" he notes. Mishra points to the sharp fall in net long positions, suggesting that institutional players are no longer willing to ride out the storm. On the derivatives front, the long-short ratio of foreign institutional investors (FIIs) has dropped to 25 percent, indicating that 75 percent of their positions are now on the short side. This marks a sharp decline from the nearly 40 percent level seen at the end of the March series expiry. Interestingly, foreign investors are increasingly using index options instead of taking directional bets through index futures—a sign of elevated caution. ""It’s a way to hedge without being fully exposed,"" says Palviya. The activity is reflected in the open interest build-up. Deep out-of-the-money puts around the 21,000 level and heavy call writing at 22,300–22,500 suggest that traders are bracing for wide price swings. The Bank Nifty also portrays a complex picture. While the index held above long-term averages, it still faced supply pressure. Palviya believes the upcoming RBI monetary policy has only added to the uncertainty. ""The heavy buying in Bank Nifty options despite selling in futures indicates hedge-based strategies in play. A lot hinges on what the RBI announces,"" he adds. On the options front, Mishra observes a mixed picture. While the 22,000 strike has some support on the put side, aggressive call writing at 23,000 and above shows limited belief in an upside breakout. “There’s clear resistance in the 22,500–22,700 zone. Unless Nifty breaches that, we’ll likely stay range-bound or drift lower,” he adds. In terms of trading strategy, both experts advise restraint. ""Don’t try to catch a falling knife,"" warns Palviya. ""The volatility we’re seeing—4 to 5 percent intraday swings—makes most indicators unreliable. It’s all about risk management now."" Mishra echoes the sentiment, recommending hedged strategies like bear spreads near resistance zones or protective puts for investors holding long positions. Dalal Street went into a freefall on April 7, as panic-selling took the benchmark indices sharply lower. Triggered by Donald Trump’s tariff tantrum on Wall Street, a wave of global jitters wiped out a jaw-dropping Rs 16 lakh crore in market value — the sharpest intraday collapse since June 2024. Inflation fears, a looming consumption crunch, and recession fears had investors running for cover as the Nifty and Sensex plunged deep into the red.

The brokerage has cited the reasons behind its review to be that of a strong recovery path and improving profitability over the coming years. Following this, Suven Pharma shares were trading at Rs 1,070 which reflects a gain of 1.55 percent while Piramal Pharma is trading at Rs 222 which marks a gain of 2.53 percent, as of 12 pm. For Suven Pharma, Goldman has given a target price of Rs 1,350 per share, predicting a sharp rebound from FY26. According to the brokerage, the recovery will be led by Suven's top-performing drugs and potential new drug approvals in the pipeline. The recent quarter also marked a successful integration of Cohance, Sapala, and NJ Bio — acquisitions that Goldman expects will power Suven's EBITDA to grow at a CAGR of over 20 percent in the near term. Meanwhile, Piramal Pharma has also caught Goldman’s attention. The brokerage has initiated coverage with a ‘Buy’ rating and a target price of Rs 275 per share, underlining that the company is well-positioned for top-quartile profit growth. Goldman projects that Piramal's Profit Before Tax (PBT) margin will improve sharply, rising from around 3 percent in FY24 to over 16 percent by FY28. This margin expansion, the note says, will be driven by a combination of CDMO (Contract Development and Manufacturing Organisation) business growth, CHG (complex hospital generics) capacity expansion, and a turnaround in its ICH (inhalation and complex hospital) business. Both stocks are being seen as attractive long-term bets in the pharma space as the sector stabilises after a volatile few year.

The poll features responses from around 18 market experts across mutual funds, PMS, Family Offices and leading brokerages. Most experts polled believe that markets may be closer to a bottom, but clarity is yet to emerge with respect to the global impact of tariffs, but they remain largely sanguine about India-specific factors. “RBI and the government clearly have created tailwinds for discretionary spends to perk up. This could help the markets to get its mojo back. Given the correction, the Indian market valuations have become reasonable. Declining inflation, interest rates, improved liquidity conditions could place the markets in a good stead for the medium term,” said Shashank Khade, Co-Founder and Chief Equity Advisor, Entrust Family Office. One of the fund managers, Ankita Pathak, Chief Macro and Global Strategist at Ionic Wealth said it is important to look beyond US equities. She added that markets will be watching for triggers indicating a revival. “All eyes should be on central banks and earnings season ahead.” Here are the key highlights from the survey: 1. Half the experts unsure if markets have bottomedWhen asked whether markets have bottomed out, 50% of the respondents admitted they 'can’t say', highlighting the uncertainty in the global environment. Only 16.7% said the bottom is in place, while an equal number said that the markets haven’t bottomed yet. Another 16.7% respondents anticipated a potential 10% downside in 2025. 2. Cash remains in focusIn response to whether cash is still king, 38.9% of participants said they are holding more than 20% of their portfolio in cash. Close to 27.8% respondents said they are holding less than 5% in cash, and 22.2% said they are in the 5–10% range. Only 11.1% respondents said they are keeping 10–20% portfolio in cash. 3. Open to deploying more cash into stocksAround 83.3% of respondents indicated plans to deploy more cash into equities, suggesting a growing optimism or readiness to capitalise on market corrections. Only 5.6% said they wouldn’t be looking to add long-positions in this ongoing volatile phase, and 11.1% remained uncertain. 4. Nifty seen between 22,000 and 24,000 this yearOn where the Nifty level for the end of the year, 66.7% respondents said they expect it to settle in the 22,000–24,000 range, a slightly lower view than what was being factoted in earlier this year, yet the highest among survey options. Another 22.2% see a close between 20,000-22,000, while 11.1% respondents see levels between 18,000-20,000. None of the respondents expects the index to drop below 18,000. Out of the six respondents that hold more than 20 percent in cash, there were three mutual fund and four portfolio managers. 5. Consumption is top sectoral pickWhen it comes to sector preferences, FMCG and Consumer Discretionary emerged as the most favoured, each with 44.4% of the vote. Energy and Consumer Durables followed closely at 33.3%. IT, Capital Goods, and Banks each garnered 22.2%, while Metals and Oil & Gas trailed slightly.

"Metal index snaps three-day slump; Adani Enterprises, JSW Steel, others rise up to 6% on China stimulus hopes",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/metal-index-snaps-three-day-slump-tata-steel-jsw-others-rise-up-to-2-on-china-stimulus-hopes-12988269.html,"The shares of metal companies strongly surged on April 8, helped by reports of China considering further stimulus to support domestic demand, even as Trump's tariffs added to the uncertainty around global trade that had sent the Nifty Metal index lower for three sessions. News reports have suggested that China may be discussing frontloading stimulus to counter US tariff levy, with a Bloomberg News report dated April 7 saying that Beijing is preparing a plan to defend its economic interests amid heightened trade uncertainties. US President Trump had on April 2 introduced a slew of reciprocal tariffs on several nations, including 26 percent tariff on Indian imports, triggering an escalation in trade tensions, with countries threatening counter-measures. China said it will impose 34 percent tariff on US imports. Global equity markets had crashed on April 7, as investors worried over a possible US recession and the implications of a trade war, with Metal stocks among the worst hit, and Nifty Metal crashing nearly 7 percent. However, the latest report on China's stimulus package and the decline in the strength of the US dollar has likely helped stocks stage a recovery. Nifty Metal closed over 1.5 percent higher at 7,965.60. Lloyds Metals And Energy shares were the top gainer on the index, rising over 6 percent. JSW Steel and Adani Enterprises shares were up nearly 3 percent each. APL Apollo Tubes and Hindustan Copper shares also closed nearly 3 percent higher. National Aluminum, Hindalco, Jindal Steel & Power, Jindal Stainless Steel and other stocks recorded gains over 1 percent. Tata Steel shares closed in the green with marginal gains. This comes a day after the stock crashed 10 percent to briefly get locked in the lower circuit. Other metal stocks which were trading in the green with marginal gains included NMDC, Vedanta and Steel Authority of India (SAIL). Despite the positive momentum in the index, Welspun Corp shares closed nearly 3 percent lower at Rs 770 apiece. PL Capital's latest note said that it sees opportunities to invest after the recent fall in share prices. ""We believe the recent sharp fall in stocks makes valuations attractive and offers an opportunity to invest in companies having higher domestic exposure as domestic demand is expected to remain stable,"" the PL note said. ""...US tariffs and rationalization of Chinese steel capacities had led to increase in steel prices across regions. However, escalating trade tariffs have increased the risk of supply chain disruptions, high inflation, and slowdown of global economies which have affected commodity prices,"" PL Capital added. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services has said that the uncertainty and volatility may linger on for some more time. ""There are some significant takeaways from the ongoing chaos. One, the trade war is like to be confined to US and China. Others including EU and Japan have opted for negotiations. India has already started negotiations on a BTA with US. Two, the risk of a recession in the US has increased. Three, China is likely to be the worst-hit economy,"" said Vijayakumar. US President Trump’s threat of another 50 percent tariff on China, on top of the recently announced one threatens to 'freeze' Chinese exports to US. ""China will try to dump its products like metals in other countries, and this will keep international metal prices depressed,"" Vijayakumar added.

"Realty, media stocks sink 4-5% even as experts back domestic plays for stability",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/realty-media-stocks-sink-4-5-even-as-experts-back-domestic-plays-for-stability-12987477.html,"While experts have been advocating for domestic-facing sectors to hold up better amidst tariff-related volatility, Nifty Realty and Nifty Media indices bore the brunt of a steep selloff on April 7, falling by 5 percent and 4 percent, respectively. The sharp declines came as part of a broader market rout, though analysts believe these dips may present attractive buying opportunities for investors with a long-term horizon. So far this year, both the Nifty Realty and Nifty Media indices have underperformed significantly, shedding over 20 percent each, compared to a relatively moderate 6 percent decline in the benchmark Nifty 50 index. ALSO READ: Tariff turbulence: Nifty, Sensex outperform global peers; Asian, European markets crash up to 13% Jaspreet Singh Arora, Chief Investment Officer at Equentis Wealth Advisory Services, acknowledged the pressure faced by IT and export-driven sectors due to ongoing trade tensions. However, he noted that domestic consumption-oriented sectors are better positioned to withstand external shocks. “For long-term investors, the current environment calls for discipline. Stick to your asset allocation and avoid knee-jerk reactions. As for short-term traders, the heightened volatility demands a cautious and tactical approach,” Arora added. Kranthi Bathini, Equity Strategist at WealthMills Securities, echoed similar sentiments, explaining that the downturn in Nifty Realty was largely sentiment-driven and not rooted in any specific negative fundamental developments. “Historically, Nifty Realty has been a strong performer during bullish phases. The current decline is more reflective of the overall market weakness and not due to any real deterioration in the sector’s outlook,” Bathini said. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, also supported the view that the weakness in domestic-oriented sectors like real estate and media is likely temporary. He stressed that any significant correction in these areas should be viewed as a buying opportunity. “In the context of ongoing global tariff issues, sectors tied to domestic demand are relatively safer bets,” he said. On April 7, benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty closed with sharp losses of 3 percent each, as global concerns spooked investor sentiment. Negative cues from Wall Street reverberated across world markets, including India, and fears of a looming recession combined with escalating trade tensions added to the pressure. Investor anxiety deepened following China’s retaliatory move to impose a 34 percent tariff on US goods, in response to US President Donald Trump’s aggressive trade stance—amplifying fears of a drawn-out trade war.

The recent US tariff announcements are not specifically targeted at India, they are being applied worldwide. So, while India's direct export exposure to the US is limited, the broader implications of a global tariff regime are unsettling markets everywhere.

Domestic brokerages JM Financials and Emkay Global reiterated their bullish ‘buy’ rating, with a target price of Rs 400 and Rs 380, respectively. “By combining forces, the companies intend to provide a more seamless and enhanced service experience to their collective customer base. Delhivery sees strategic value in Ecom’s experienced team and robust network, with the company potentially gaining the opportunity to cherry pick the right facilities,” said JM Financial.

Global uncertainties erupted after US President Donald Trump announced a slew of reciprocal tariffs on a number of nations, triggering trade wars and recession fears.

In contrast, the Nifty Pharma index came under significant pressure, following indications from the Trump administration about possible tariffs on pharmaceutical imports in the future. Within the Nifty FMCG index, 3 out of 15 constituents managed to trade in positive territory despite the widespread selloff. Shares of Hindustan Unilever (HUL), Britannia, and Godrej Consumer Products posted gains of up to 0.6 percent, offering some resilience in an otherwise red-dominated market. Meanwhile, the Nifty Pharma index saw all 20 of its constituents trading in the red. Stocks such as Biocon, IPCA Laboratories, Granules India, and Divi's Laboratories recorded sharp declines in the range of 6 to 7 percent, as sentiment soured further in the sector. ALSO READ: India VIX hits 5-year high amid trade war jitters, experts warn of wild swings ahead The relative outperformance of FMCG stocks is attributed to their consumer-facing nature, which tends to provide a cushion during market volatility. These companies are primarily focused on domestic markets and have minimal exposure to exports, shielding them from external shocks such as trade tariffs or sanctions. In contrast, the pharma sector—another typically defensive play—continued to face selling pressure for the second consecutive day. This followed concerns that the US might impose tariffs on pharmaceutical imports from India. Currently, Indian drug exports to the US enjoy a tax-free status, while pharmaceutical imports from the US into India are subject to a 10 percent tariff. The Trump administration’s tariff rhetoric has raised alarms among Indian pharma companies, many of which are in a 'wait and watch' mode. Industry players have also flagged the challenges and rising costs associated with setting up manufacturing operations in the US, which could become necessary if trade restrictions are enforced.

Stocks pare losses as panic selling slows; buyers step in at oversold levels,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sensex-nifty-crash-over-3-as-trump-tariff-rout-deepens-rs-16-lakh-crore-m-cap-wiped-out-12987115.html,"Dalal Street went into a freefall on April 7, as panic-selling took the benchmark indices sharply lower. Triggered by Donald Trump’s tariff tantrum on Wall Street, a wave of global jitters wiped out a jaw-dropping Rs 16 lakh crore in market value — the sharpest intraday collapse since June 2024. Inflation fears, a looming consumption crunch, and recession fears had investors running for cover as the Nifty and Sensex plunged deep into the red. However, day-end buying allowed markets to cut their losses with Sensex recovering 800 points from day's low to close 2,226.79 points or 2.95 percent lower at 73,137.90, and the Nifty closed 742.85 points or 3.24 percent lower at 22,161.60. About 559 shares advanced, 3,372 shares declined, and 137 shares were unchanged. India VIX — the fear gauge of the domestic market — soared as much as 66 percent to 22.85 on April 7, marking its sharpest intraday spike since June 4, 2024, according to Bloomberg data. The dramatic surge has completely erased the downtrend that had been in place since the latter half of January this year. The fall in Indian benchmarks was much lower than their European and Asian counterparts. In Asia, the Hong Kong Hang Seng's 13 percent one-day slump was the largest since 1997, while in mainland China the blue-chip CSI 300 index was down 7 percent only finding a floor when state media reported China's sovereign fund Central Huijin was a buyer. European stocks tumbled, dropping to the lowest since January 2024 as investors priced in significant economic repercussions from the global trade war initiated by Trump’s aggressive new tariff regime. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index sank as much as 6.5 percent, extending losses after its biggest weekly decline since March 2020. The gauge was trading 5 percent lower as of 11 a.m. in London, marking a level last seen at the beginning of 2024. The DAX was 5.4 percent lower after plunging as much as 10 percent. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates ""The primary reason behind the selloff is the fear of a full-blown global trade war and its potential to tip the world economy into a recession. Countries including China, Canada, and the European Union have spoken about retaliatory tariffs on American goods, and the uncertainty around whether a settlement can be reached before the next phase of tariff hikes is causing widespread nervousness,"" Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Research and Wealth Management said in a conversation with Moneycontrol. Khemka advised against panic selling or making adventurous bets. Instead, he recommended a disciplined, long-term approach. Investors should use the correction to gradually accumulate fundamentally strong, domestically focused companies, particularly in consumption, financials, and banks. These areas are better positioned to weather global headwinds compared to globally exposed sectors like IT, pharma, and metals. He added that domestic themes such as consumption remain India’s strongest long-term bet. While they may not deliver outsized short-term returns, they are likely to hold up better in a downturn. Crude-linked sectors such as oil marketing companies and aviation could also benefit from falling oil prices. Among sectoral indices, Nifty Metal was the top loser, nosediving 7 percent led by Tata Steel, JSW Steel, Hindalco, and Hindalco were the main drags. Nifty Realty, Auto, Bank, Infra, IT, Oil and Gas, and Pharma all fell in the range of 3-4 percent each. The broader market, represented by mid and smallcap 100 indices also showcased bearish trends with losses of 4 percent each. Khemka said the space is more vulnerable to a slowdown because they have limited geographical and product diversification and are more exposed to demand shocks. Tata Motors, India's leading EV player, cracked over 8 percent after its subsidiary, Jaguar Land Rover Ltd announced that it will be pausing shipments to the US for the month of April, in response to the tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump on imports of automobiles and auto parts into the US. JLR last week said that it will be pausing shipments to the US for a month as it assesses the impact of the tariffs on vehicle imports. Siemens India shares nosedived over 50 percent on Monday, April 7, as the stock turned ex-demerger. It opened at Rs 2,450, a steep fall from its previous close of Rs 4,928.15, before clawing back some ground to trade around Rs 2,836.75. The demerger was carried out in a 1:1 ratio, entitling eligible shareholders to one share of Siemens Energy India for every share held in Siemens India as of the record date, April 7. The cut-off to qualify for the corporate action was Friday, April 4. ""The trend-deciding level for the day is 22,992. If Nifty trades above this level, it may further rally up to 23,127-23,349-23,484 levels. However, if it trades below 22,992 levels, we may witness profit booking in the market, and the index may correct up to 22,770-22,635-22,412 levels,"" Axis Securities said in a note. ""The trend-deciding level for the day is 51,586. If Bank Nifty trades above this level, it may rally up to 51811-52,119-52,344 levels. However, if it trades below 51,586 levels, we may witness profit booking in the market, and the index may correct up to 51,278-51,052-50,744 levels,"" the brokerage added. FMCG bellwether Hindustan Unilever was the only gainer on the Nifty. Laggards on the Nifty included Trent, JSW Steel, Tata Steel, Hindalco and Shriram Finance.

This sharp selloff in the share price was fuelled after the government announced plans to sell up to 4.83 percent stake in the PSU defence firm at a floor price of Rs 2,525 per share. Notably, the shares of the Navratna company have now fallen nearly 9 percent below the floor price for the OFS. The defence PSU stock was trading at Rs 2,294 per share in the afternoon. The sharp selloff in the stock price coincides with the downturn in the overall market. Benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty crashed nearly 4 percent each as US President Donald Trump's reciprocal tariffs stoked recession fears, which rattled global markets. Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders is currently one of the top losers on the Nifty India Defence index, which itself was down over 6 percent. The shares of the company have so far fallen over 13 percent in the last five sessions. The stock is currently nearly 22 percent lower than its 52-week high level. The OFS which opened today for retail investors, will see the government selling 1.14 crore equity shares of the company, with a greenshoe option to sell additional 80.67 lakh shares. The share sale of up to 4.83 percent stake at a floor price of Rs 2,525 a piece would fetch about Rs 5,000 crore to the exchequer. ""Government will divest 2.83 percent equity with an additional 2% as green shoe option,"" DIPAM Secretary Arunish Chawla had said in a post on X last week. After the OFS opened for retail investors on Monday, Chawla told ET Now, ""We kickstarted the year with a bang. We did an OFS in the market for Mazagon Dock. And we lit the spark when there was gloom everywhere. Everyone was focused on what President Trump was doing and everyone was selling short. We surprised everyone with an OFS, and the strategy played off. By the end of the day, we were oversubscribed 142 percent.""

READ MORE: LIVE updates and news stories Bajaj Housing has reported strong provisional numbers for the March quarter, with Assets Under Management (AUM) rising 26 percent year-on-year to around Rs 1.14 lakh crore as of March 31, 2025. It stood at Rs 91,370 crore a year earlier. Loan assets grew significantly to Rs 99,500 crore, compared to Rs 79,301 crore in the same period last year. However, a bearish market sentiment weighed on the stock performance on April 7. Gross disbursements for Q4 FY25 stood at approximately Rs 14,250 crore, up from Rs 11,393 crore in Q4 FY24, reflecting healthy demand for home loans and real estate financing. These numbers are provisional and subject to audit review. April is set to be a key month for the company as the shareholder lock-in period comes to an end. According to Nuvama, over 64 percent of Bajaj Housing Finance’s outstanding equity — about 529 crore shares — will become eligible for trade. While not all shares are expected to be sold, the unlocking could influence stock sentiment.

The combined entity would command ~55-60% market share of the 3PL B2C express market, dwarfing the immediate peer by ~3x. Apart from scale benefits, given that both operators service ~97% of pincodes in India, we believe there are significant cost synergies to be realized over the next 12-18 months. Improvement in network utilization, especially in the last mile (~50% of linehaul costs in the B2C express segment), should aid profitability in our view, once networks are integrated. While valuations are fairly attractive, the acquisition is unlikely to be earnings accretive in the near term. With majority of customers being common between the two and given the learnings from the Spoton acquisition, we expect sales retention and network integration to be relatively smooth. However, concerns around Meesho increasing insourcing of logistics would continue to cast a shadow on the volume trajectory in the near term.

Siemens India shares surge 20% on ex-date for energy business spin-off,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/siemens-india-shares-surge-20-on-ex-date-for-energy-business-spin-off-12986996.html,"Shares of Siemens Ltd rose over 20 percent on April 7 as the capital goods major went ex-demerger post-spin-off of its energy business in India. Shareholders will get one share of Siemens Energy India for every Siemens India share they own. The stock plunged 40 percent as part of price discovery for Siemens Energy and later rose 20% to trade above Rs 3,000. The steep cut came during the price discovery trade, where the valuation of the newly formed entity was determined based on the differential between Siemens India's April 4 closing price and the opening price of Siemens Energy on Monday. The record date for the demerger of Siemens India’s energy business was set for April 7, 2025, and the pricing process has been guided by inputs from both domestic active and passive fund managers. Nuvama Alternative & Quantitative Research noted that Siemens Energy’s price, until its listing, should ideally reflect the valuation gap derived during the SPOS session. The firm clarified that Siemens Energy will temporarily remain in all NSE and BSE indices — including the Nifty Next 50 — at this discovered price until its listing date. As for global passive fund managers such as MSCI and FTSE, Nuvama said no index adjustments or trading activity is expected on the record date itself, i.e., April 7. Their moves will likely follow only after the new entity lists. The market reaction highlights investor caution as the newly formed Siemens Energy begins its journey as a separately listed entity, while clarity on its standalone valuation and index inclusion continues to evolve.

All six companies, part of the benchmark Nifty 50 index, witnessed sharp declines following heightened volatility as hefty reciprocal tariffs sparked fears of global trade war. Trent emerged as the biggest loser on the index, with its shares plunging as much as 19 percent. The drop marked the company’s steepest single-day fall since March 2020, triggered by investor disappointment with its March quarter business update. Although revenue rose 28 percent year-on-year to Rs 4,334 crore from Rs 3,381 crore, the figure fell short of expectations and trailed the company’s five-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36 percent. With this fall, Trent is now trading nearly 43 percent below its 52-week high, reflecting a sharp reversal in investor sentiment. ALSO READ: Midcaps, smallcaps crumble as tariff shock, US recession fears rattle investors Tata Motors also saw a significant decline of 12 percent after its subsidiary, Jaguar Land Rover, announced a pause in shipments to the US in response to the automobile import tariffs announced by US President Donald Trump. The move sparked concerns about future export disruptions and margin pressures. Tata Steel followed closely, dropping as much as 11 percent as metal stocks took a hit across the board. Investor sentiment weakened further after the US imposed a 25 percent tariff on steel and aluminum imports earlier in March, with President Trump also suggesting a possible extension of tariffs to copper. While metals were not part of the latest round of reciprocal tariffs, investors remained cautious about the broader implications of an escalating trade war. Shares of TCS fell 7 percent to hit a 52-week low of Rs 3,060 apiece. The decline was attributed to growing fears of a US recession and investor caution ahead of the company’s upcoming fourth-quarter earnings. According to analysts at HDFC Securities, large IT firms are likely to report flat to marginally negative revenue growth for the March quarter, with expectations ranging from -1.8 percent to +0.1 percent on a sequential basis. The outlook has been dampened by weaker demand, reduced billing days, and lower discretionary tech spending. The rout extended to Titan Company and Tata Consumer Products, which fell 5 percent and 6 percent respectively, as concerns over consumption demand and overall market weakness weighed heavily on the stocks.

The company said its same-store sales growth (SSSG) came in at around 21% for the quarter, while it added 25 showrooms in India during Q4FY25 and launched three more in the first week of April. In the Middle East, revenue rose by 24% compared to the same quarter last year, largely attributed to existing stores. The Middle East business accounted for roughly 12% of Kalyan’s consolidated revenue, the company said. Kalyan's digital-first platform Candere reported a 22% on-year decline in revenue, during the March quarter. The company opened 14 Candere showrooms during the Q4FY25. Looking ahead to FY26, the company reiterated plans to launch 170 new showrooms across its Kalyan and Candere formats. These would include 75 franchise-owned company-operated (FOCO) Kalyan stores outside of south India, 15 FOCO showrooms in south India and international markets, and 80 Candere showrooms in India. As of March 31, 2025, Kalyan had a total of 388 showrooms, 270 in India under the Kalyan format, 36 in the Middle East, one in America, and 73 under the Candere brand. Last week, during an exclusive chat with Moneycontrol, Kalyan's Executive Director Ramesh Kalyanaraman sounded confident that the reciprocal tariffs will have limited impact on the company's business. “Our only US store sources material from Dubai, where the export duty has now moved to 10 percent under the new tariff. So the difference is marginal"", Ramesh Kalyanaraman added, “There is no negative impact. The only change, which is very minimal, is the 3 percent increase in duty from Dubai. That cost would ultimately be passed on to the end-consumer.” Donald Trump's 26 percent reciprocal tariff on Indian goods is expected to hit the $32 billion gems and jewellery export market, of which the US accounts for about $11.58 billion, or 34 percent.

US President Trump introduced a slew of tariffs on multiple countries, with India being charged 26 percent on all its exports bound for America. Experts have raised fears of a global trade war as some nations have retaliated with counter-measures. Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Investments said, ""The recent implementation of higher-than-anticipated US tariffs has had a significant impact on global markets, triggering a bearish trend as investors assess broader implications. The likelihood of retaliatory measures against the US has further heightened uncertainty. US bond yields and oil prices are trending downward, reflecting concerns over potential economic slowdown and increased recessionary risks.""

"Midcaps, smallcaps crumble as tariff shock, US recession fears rattle investors",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/midcaps-smallcaps-crumble-as-tariff-shock-us-recession-fears-rattle-investors-12986731.html,"Broader markets took a severe hit on April 7, as investor sentiment soured sharply following China's decision to impose retaliatory tariffs of 34 percent on the US. The move reignited fears of a global trade war and sent shockwaves across the Indian equity space. The Nifty Midcap 100 and Nifty Smallcap 100 indices bore the brunt of the selloff, plunging as much as 6 percent and significantly underperforming the benchmark indices, which themselves saw steep declines of around 3 percent. Every single stock within the Nifty Midcap 100 and Nifty Smallcap 100 universes was trading in negative territory, reflecting the intensity of the selloff. Among midcaps, shares of Mazagon Dock, Bharat Forge, and NALCO witnessed the steepest corrections, each tumbling by 10 percent. In the smallcap segment, Tejas Networks, Newgen Software, and Garden Reach Shipbuilders were among the hardest hit, with each stock declining by 11 percent. ALSO READ: Nifty IT crashes 7% as Trump doubles down on tariffs; Infosys, Coforge lead losses, tumbling 10% The sharp downturn in equities was further amplified by growing concerns over a potential recession in the US. Historically, recessionary fears in the US tend to trigger global risk aversion, leading to a pullback in foreign investment and denting investor confidence in emerging markets like India. According to online prediction platform Polymarket, there is now a 64 percent probability of a US recession in 2025—a sharp rise from the 38 percent likelihood recorded just a week ago. Investor confidence has deteriorated swiftly in the wake of these developments, with analysts noting that China’s retaliatory action has raised the risk of an escalating trade war. Kotak Institutional Equities stated that the higher-than-anticipated tariffs, coupled with a murky global macroeconomic backdrop, should lead to a more cautious investment environment. Adding to the cautious outlook, Barclays has projected a potential downside risk of 30 basis points to India’s GDP growth for FY26 due to the fallout from global trade tensions. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs anticipates a 2 to 3 percent impact on corporate earnings growth over the next couple of years as a direct consequence of the new tariff measures.

The fall in the metal stocks is in-line with the overall weakness, following the major crash on Monday morning, as US President Trump's reciprocal tariffs rattled global markets and triggered fears of a tariff war. As a result of the uncertainty, the US index futures too are under selling pressure, with S&P 500 futures lower by 4 percent as of 10:00 am. Tata Steel shares later made some recovery, to close nearly 7 percent lower at Rs 130.20 apiece. Lloyds Metals and Energy shares plunged nearly 9 percent, while National Aluminium Company, JSW Steel and Hindustan Copper closed nearly 8 percent lower. SAIL, Vedanta Limited and Hindalco shares plunged nearly 6 percent. Adani Enterprises, NMDC, Welspun Corp and other metal stocks also ended the session in the deep red, with losses more than 2 percent. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services said, ""Globally markets are going through heightened volatility caused by extreme uncertainty. No one has a clue about how this turbulence caused by Trump tariffs will evolve. Wait and watch would be the best strategy in this turbulent phase of the market."" Vijayakumar added that investors should bear in mind that the uncertainty may not last too long, and India has been relatively better-placed than most Asian peers. ""There are a few things that investors should keep in mind. One, the irrational Trump tariffs will not continue for long. Two, India is relatively better placed since India’s exports to the US as percentage of GDP is only around 2 percent and therefore the impact on India’s growth will not be significant. Three, India is negotiating a Bilateral Trade Agreement with the US and this is likely to be successful resulting in lower tariffs for India."" US President Trump had imposed 25 percent tariff on steel and aluminum imports earlier in March, and hinted at tariff on copper imports as well. While his recent reciprocal tariff announcement didn't include metals, investors are concerned over the impact as countries like China retaliate to US tariffs, resulting in trade wars.

The market breadth was strongly in favour of declines, with about 2,159 shares seeing correction compared to 430 rising shares on the NSE. The market is expected to see more weakness in the upcoming sessions, given the dismal global cues. Below are some trading ideas for the near term: Rajesh Bhosale, Technical Analyst at Angel One Max Financial Services | CMP: Rs 1,165 Max Financial Services (MFSL) has registered a bullish breakout from multiple chart patterns. The stock has closed above its February swing high of Rs 1,160, confirming a rounding bottom breakout. Following a strong rally from the Rs 1,050 zone and a brief consolidation phase, we are now witnessing a Flag pattern breakout, indicating a strong trend resumption. Both breakouts are backed by healthy volumes and a favourable setup across key indicators. We expect this positive momentum to continue in the near term. Hence, we recommend buying MFSL around Rs 1,165 - Rs 1,155. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,265 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,115 Tata Consumer Products | CMP: Rs 1,087.85 Tata Consumer delivered strong performance despite weakness in the broader market during the last week. The stock has closed above its February swing high of Rs 1,075, establishing a higher top–higher bottom structure, which indicates the continuation of a bullish price cycle. On both the daily and weekly charts, the stock has formed strong bullish candles and closed above all major moving averages, reinforcing the positive momentum. Hence, we recommend buying Tata Consumer Products around Rs 1,088 - Rs 1,080.

The stock is currently hovering near a key pivot level of Rs 11,750. What makes this setup compelling is the strong accumulation seen at the base, with volume patterns indicating that weak hands have exited after a failed low.

Despite a weak broader market, the stock broke out in the previous session at Rs 1,812, signaling renewed momentum. What adds weight to this move is the base-on-base structure. The current breakout is backed by two earlier bases, neither of which saw failed moves or sharp reversals. This triple base formation suggests strong institutional support. With a clean breakout in place, HDFC Bank could be setting up for sustained upside in the sessions ahead. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,950 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,750 Axis Bank | CMP: Rs 1,091.3 Axis Bank has broken out of a bullish rounding bottom pattern on the daily chart around the Rs 1,070 mark.

More than 90 small-caps post double-digit returns as index outperforms,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/more-than-90-small-caps-post-double-digit-returns-as-index-outperforms-12985761.html,"Broader indices remained under pressure during the week, but the small-cap index relatively outperformed despite losing 1.6 percent as domestic as well as global markets witnessed a sharp fall following the reciprocal tariff announcement by US President Donald Trump. During the week, the BSE Large-cap and Mid-cap indices fell 2.5 percent each, while the BSE Small-Cap index shed 1.6 percent. For the week, the BSE Sensex index shed 2050.23 points or 2.64 percent to close at 75,364.69, and Nifty50 fell 614.9 points or 2.61 percent to end at 22,904.45. On the sectoral front, Nifty Information Technology index records biggest weekly fall of 9 percent since COVID 2020 on global growth concerns. Nifty Metal index down 7.5 percent, Nifty Oil & Gas index shed 4 percent, while Nifty Realty and Auto indices slipped 3 percent each. ""The new financial year has commenced on a subdued note, largely driven by the imposition of higher-than-anticipated tariffs by the US. Sectors like IT and metals have underperformed relative to the broader market, reflecting growing concerns over the outlook for the US economy and potential retaliatory trade actions by other countries. Investors are expected to closely monitor any countermeasures implemented by global trade partners, which could further exacerbate geopolitical and economic uncertainty. This cautious sentiment is reflected in the sustained rally in gold and bond prices, underscoring a pronounced shift toward safe-haven assets,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments. ""The tariffs imposed on India are relatively lower compared to those on other Asian economies, offering a degree of relief. Any constructive developments arising from the ongoing India–US bilateral trade negotiations could serve as a supportive catalyst for the market. Investor attention is also firmly fixed on the upcoming MPC meeting, with the benchmark interest rate decision expected next week. A favourable outcome could benefit rate-sensitive sectors. In addition, key macroeconomic indicators—namely India’s inflation figures and US jobless claims—will be closely watched, as they are likely to offer critical insights into the underlying economic conditions in both regions,"" he added. ""Meanwhile, market focus is gradually shifting toward the upcoming corporate earnings season. The initial outlook remains subdued, with the risk of further downward revisions to earnings growth, largely due to tepid demand and continued margin pressures. The IT sector, in particular, is expected to report soft numbers, and investor sentiment will hinge heavily on management commentary. Persistent global growth concerns and the potential for elevated inflation in the US may lead companies to delay discretionary IT spending, further dampening the sector’s near-term outlook,"" Nair added further. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) turned net sellers in this week, as they sold equities worth Rs 13,730.49 crore, while Domestic Institutional Investors (DII) bought equities worth Rs 5,632.56 crore. The BSE Small-cap index shed 1.6 percent with Pokarna, Garware Hi-Tech Films, Avanti Feeds, Gensol Engineering, Blue Jet Healthcare, MPS, Sharda Cropchem, Cigniti Technologies falling between 9-25 percent. However, Hester Biosciences, Baazar Style Retail, Primo Chemicals, Shiva Cement, Valiant Organics, Nacl Industries, Vadilal Industries, Sportking India, Ganesh Benzoplast, Vardhman Textiles, Parag Milk Foods, Tarsons Products rising between 21-46 percent. Where is Nifty50 headed? Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities Nifty on the weekly chart slipped into weakness after the formation of doji type candle pattern in last week. We observe negative reversal pattern in the last three weekly candles. Hence, more weakness could be in store. The short-term trend of Nifty remains weak and the downward correction seems to have gained momentum. Further weakness below 22800 levels, Nifty could slide down to the next lower trajectory of around 22350 levels in the near term. Any pullback rally from here could find resistance around 23150 levels. Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Research, Wealth Management, Motilal Oswal Financial Services Investors will be awaiting US Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech tonight, for insights into Fed’s assessment of the US economy and clues on the monetary policy outlook following the tariff announcements. Apart from developments on the US tariff front, market focus will be on RBI’s monetary policy announcement on 9th April and the Q4FY25 corporate earnings beginning with TCS results on 10th April next week. We expect market to remain volatile with sector specific action, tracking RBI’s interest rate decision, pre-quarterly business updates/Q4 results and global market cues. Aditya Gaggar, Director of Progressive Shares The market has been adversely affected by Trump’s tariff policies, causing Nifty50 to form a bearish candle on the weekly chart, and in the case of a trend continuation, the Index is likely to slide to 22,600. On the flip side, the daily chart suggests that the Index may be developing the right shoulder of an Inverted Head and Shoulders pattern, which could signal a potential reversal if it closes firmly above 23,800. The immediate resistance and support levels for Nifty50 are placed at 23,150 and 22,780, respectively. Amol Athawale, VP-Technical Research, Kotak Securities In the last truncated week, the benchmark indices witnessed selling pressure at higher levels, with the Nifty ends 2.6 percent lower while the Sensex was down by 2050 points. Among sectors, the IT index lost the most, shedding over 9 percent; however, despite the weak market sentiment, some buying interest was seen in PSU Bank stocks, resulting in the PSU Bank index gaining over 1 percent. During the week, the market breached the crucial support zone of 23,500/77400, and after this breakdown, selling pressure intensified. Technically, on the weekly charts, it has formed a long bearish candle, and on the intraday charts, it is holding a lower top formation, which supports further weakness from the current levels. We believe that after a sharp correction, the market is currently trading near the 20-day and 50-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs). The short-term outlook suggests that if the market reclaims the 23,000/75800 mark, we could see a pullback rally up to 23,250-23,325/76500-76800. On the flip side, fresh selling is possible only after a break below 22,800/75200. If that happens, it could slip to 22,700/74900. Further downside may continue, potentially dragging the index down to 22,500/74400.

"Trump tariff tailspin worsens, Nasdaq confirms in bear market",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trump-tariff-tailspin-worsens-nasdaq-confirms-in-bear-market-12985744.html,"Wall Street nosedived for a second straight day on Friday, confirming the Nasdaq Composite was in a bear market and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was in a correction, as an escalating global trade war spurred the biggest losses since the pandemic. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite posted their largest two-day declines since the emerging coronavirus caused global panic during U.S. President Donald Trump's first term. For Thursday and Friday, the Dow was down 9.3%, the S&P 500 10.5% and the Nasdaq 11.4%. Fallout from Trump's sweeping tariffs stoked fears of a global recession, wiping trillions of dollars of value from U.S. companies. Highlighting growing panic among investors, the CBOE Volatility Index, or Wall Street's fear gauge, closed at its highest level since April 2020. Since late on Wednesday, when Trump boosted tariff barriers to their highest level in more than a century, investors have dumped stocks, fearing both the new U.S. economic reality and also how U.S. trading partners might retaliate by steepening their own trade barriers. A record-breaking number of shares were traded on Friday, with volume on U.S. exchanges around 26.79 billion shares, beating the previous high of 24.48 billion shares traded on January 27, 2021. The Nasdaq slid on Friday 962.82 points, or 5.82%, to 15,587.79, confirming the tech-heavy index was in a bear market compared to its record closing high of 20,173.89 on December 16. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2,231.07 points, or 5.50%, to 38,314.86 points, confirming a correction to its record closing high of 45,014.04 on December 4. The S&P 500 lost 322.44 points, or 5.97%, to close at 5,074.08 points, its lowest finish in 11 months. ""Right now, how bad it gets depends on how committed the administration is to this set of policies which, clearly, the market is voting against,"" said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. Global governments began reacting to Trump's tariff announcement on Friday, further undermining investor sentiment that a global recession could be averted. JP Morgan said it was forecasting a 60% chance of the global economy entering a recession by year-end, up from 40% previously. China's finance ministry said it would impose additional tariffs of 34% on all U.S. goods from April 10. Meanwhile, the prime ministers of Britain, Australia and Italy held talks on how to respond to Trump's tariff salvo. ""We're in the Wild West of a trade war right now,"" said Mariam Adams, managing director at UBS Wealth Management. For the week, the S&P 500 fell 9.1%, the Dow declined 7.9%, and the Nasdaq slumped 10%. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell spoke publicly for the first time since Trump's tariff announcement. Powell highlighted the unexpectedly hefty tariffs could trigger higher inflation and slower growth, setting the stage for challenging decisions for U.S. central bankers. Safe-haven buying in the bond market sent the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury notes to below 4%. This pushed U.S. bank stocks down further, with the sector under pressure globally, as the prospect of interest rate cuts from central banks and a hit to economic growth from tariffs would crimp profitability. The S&P Banks index (.SPXBK), opens new tab dropped 7.3%. All 11 S&P sectors dropped by more than 4.5%, with energy the leading laggard for the second straight day, off 8.7%, as companies tracked a 7.3% decline in U.S. crude prices. U.S.-listed shares of Chinese companies dived, with JD.com and Alibaba and Baidu all down more than 7.7%. Companies with exposure to China also fell across the board, with mega-caps such as Apple dropping 7.3%. The chipmakers index sank 7.6%, having declined 9.9% the previous day. The sector is particularly vulnerable to a double tariff whammy as many chip companies design their chips in the U.S., but have them manufactured in China.","Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2,231.07 points, or 5.50%, to 38,314.86 points, confirming a correction to its record closing high of 45,014.04 on December 4.","Wall Street nosedived for a second straight day on Friday, confirming the Nasdaq Composite was in a bear market and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was in a correction, as an escalating global trade war spurred the biggest losses since the pandemic.","Highlighting growing panic among investors, the CBOE Volatility Index, or Wall Street's fear gauge, closed at its highest level since April 2020.","Wall Street nosedived for a second straight day on Friday, confirming the Nasdaq Composite was in a bear market and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was in a correction, as an escalating global trade war spurred the biggest losses since the pandemic."

Click here to view full list Outlook for April 7 Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The Nifty has given a consolidation breakdown on the daily chart, indicating bearishness. Initially, the index found support at the crucial 22,900 level. However, sentiment remains weak, and a further decline from the current level could trigger additional market correction. On the lower end if Nifty falls below 22900 it may move toward 22676. On the higher end resistance is seen at 23100. A move above 23100 would provide a clear signal for a strong uptrend. Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets came under pressure and declined by nearly one and a half percent, largely weighed down by weak global cues. After two days of lackluster movement, the Nifty slipped below its key support level of 23,100 in early trade and continued to drift lower, eventually settling at 22,904.45. Most sectors witnessed significant pressure, with metals, pharma, and energy being the worst performers. The broader indices, which had outperformed in the previous sessions, saw a sharp correction, plunging between 3% and 4%. The sharp fall in global markets—particularly in the US—and fresh concerns over potential tariffs on pharma impacted sentiment negatively. However, sustained strength in banking and financial stocks helped limit the overall downside to some extent. Looking ahead, we anticipate a time-wise correction in the Nifty index.

DMart reported a 16.7 percent rise in its standalone revenue from operations at Rs 14,462 crore in Q4 FY25. The retail major also said that it added 28 new stores during the quarter, its highest quarterly net store additions ever during Q4 FY25, to bring the total store count to 415. The fall in the share price of the retail giant despite the positive Q4 updates comes after analysts issued cautious outlooks for the stock. Citi Research maintained its 'Sell' rating on the stock, with a target price of Rs 3,350 per share. The target price implies a downside potential of over 19 percent from the stock's previous closing price of Rs 4,158 per share. In its latest note accessed by CNBC-TV18, the international brokerage noted that the company's performance continues to be impacted by unfavorable product mix, amid a slowdown in discretionary consumption. Moreover, store additions in smaller towns and rising competition from quick commerce players further add pressures. Citi also remains cautious over the high P/E multiple at which the stock currently trades. As per data on NSE, the stock has an adjusted P/E ratio of 99.48. Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, kept an 'Underweight' rating on DMart shares, with a target price of Rs 3,260 apiece.

Tariff tremors: India better-placed than emerging market peers but that alone may not impress FIIs,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/tariff-effect-india-better-placed-among-emerging-markets-but-that-alone-may-not-impress-fiis-12984624.html,"India may be relatively better-placed in terms of the drastic tariff levies by Donald Trump on other Asian economies, but that doesn’t imply a return of foreign inflow into the country, for FIIs may be more concerned about valuations and the earnings trajectory, several equity analysts have told Moneycontrol. Impact on India Arindam Mandal, Head of Equity Research at Marcellus said India is relatively better-positioned compared to other Asian economies when it comes to the impact of Trump’s tariffs. While many Asian countries are export-dependent, India’s economy has been largely been driven by domestic demand. ""...even while global markets are absorbing the shock, the reaction in India is cautious. FPI (foreign portfolio investor) inflows are not going to flood back just because India’s hit is slightly softer. The global mood remains risk averse,” Arindam said. He also pointed out that FIIs are more concerned about valuations and the ongoing earnings downgrades in India than any tariff-related impact. The problem stems from the fact that India's strong growth relative to the world over past few years has led to a higher base. At the same time, domestic indicators like job creation have not kept pace, creating a disconnect, he added. FII Flow - Do Tariffs Matter? Marcellus' Arindam Mandal does not think that FIIs would make a short-term move based solely on the tariff levy. ""High-quality FIIs do not typically react to short-term fluctuations. Instead, they remain cautious primarily due to valuation concerns and the lack of earnings visibility in several sectors,"" he added. “FPIs are in a cautious mode and are unlikely to make quick, bullish moves just because India appears less impacted, compared to other emerging markets,"" Mandal said. Another equity analyst, Deepak Jasani said, “FPIs’ view on emerging markets will depend on the relative hit to the growth of these economies by the Trump tariffs.” What if Tariffs Are Not Rolled Back? Deepak Jasani said emerging economies and India may be staring at an extended period of selloff, if tariffs are not rolled back substantially, or the global risk appetite begins to shrink. “We could be looking at an extended downtrend in the markets. This may start with a lag of a couple of weeks from now and may continue for some time,"" his stance remains. The eventual impact could be on India’s GDP growth and corporate earnings, he said. “As it is, these measures may dent global risk appetite, to some extent. Hence, it is important that corporate earnings are not negatively impacted,"" Jasanin added. Investors may also be fearing a second-order impact of the reciprocal tariffs, in terms of inflation, interest rates and exchange rates. ""What may be impacted are the interest rates of various countries, inflation and growth. There may also be changes in fiscal policies of the affected countries, as their trade deficits will be altered and welfare spending may need to be upped,"" he said. The veteran investor added that he would closely watch for subsequent revisions or negotiations, and in case tariffs on India turn out to be relatively lower, funds may get 'diverted from other emerging markets to India'. The exclusion of some industries from the additional tariff regime may not be of much help, Deepak Jasani said. ""The MSME (micro, small and medium-sized enterprises) sector in India that derives a good amount of revenue from the US may get hit and may need to be protected."" he added. While a large part of this uncertainty is already discounted by the markets in the current valuations and there could be some recovery, that may not last very long in Jasani's view. Deepak Jasani also told Moneycontrol that there may be other events lined up, including corporate earnings for the March quarter and RBI monetary policy meeting next week, which will be tracked more keenly. Inflationary Pressure in US Siddharth Bharme, Head of Research at Asit C Mehta believes market will react to Trump’s announcements, regardless of whether they are final or not. ""These tariffs would lead to a reduction in global trade, which is not a good thing for anyone,” said Bhamre, adding that the immediate impact of tariffs would be inflationary pressure on the global consumer. Inflation typically make FIIs cautious, as it could lead to a tighter monetary policy, which may trigger outflows from emerging markets, including India, as investors seek safer assets. Read More: Indian IT sulks on 'Liberation Day' as analysts fear risk to US demand, client spends According to Nirav Karkera of Fisdom, not every sector will be hit by the trade levies, and even those that are vulnerable might face less damage than initially feared. This selective reaction may mitigate the overall impact on India’s economy, Karkera said, especially since India leans more on domestic demand, compared to some of the export-heavy Asian and emerging economies. He also thinks India’s relatively stronger diplomatic ties with the US could mean fewer trade escalations, and possibly even an opportunity to negotiate better terms. Market expert Kranti Bathini cautioned about the lingering impact of the tariffs, extending from short to medium term, when it comes to FIIs. Some countries are likely to resort to retaliatory tariffs, which may have consequences for the global economy. ""...uncertainty is likely to remain the operative word for global markets in the coming days as well,"" Bathini said. Impact of Tariffs on Dollar, Global Order Market expert Ambareesh Baliga has cautioned that US is moving towards stagflation, and these tariffs may even push the global trade against the US dollar, possibly sparking the beginning of a change of global order. At the same time, Baliga thinks India's domestic resilience - captured by FMCG, real estate, infrastructure, and cement companies - is likely to hold up better since they are more insulated from global supply-chain disruptions. Read More: Gems & Jewellery: Can the sector keep its sparkle amid Trump's tariff blitz In the short term, FII flows might decline, even though India may be relatively better-positioned compared to other emerging market peers, said Baliga.

A report by Tata Mutual Fund said India exports nearly $6.8 billion worth of automobiles and auto components to US, and the tariff announcement is likely to impact the price competitiveness of ancillary companies too. Bharat Forge shares fell nearly 8 percent, owing to its significant exposure to US market, where Class 8 trucks having a strong export base. Bharat Forge Chairman & Managing Director Baba Kalyani had recently said that the US constitutes nearly 20 percent of its total exports, hence, the tariffs are expected to impact their revenue. The company has recently seen a strong decline in the Class 8 truck orders. As per data from ACT Research, cited by CNBC-TV18, Class 8 truck orders in North America have declined for a fourth consecutive month, further fuelling the sharp selloff. Tata Motors shares fell nearly 6 percent as the company is expected to see a significant hit from the tariffs, as subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has deep exposure to the American market. JLR sold over 4 lakh units globally in FY24, of which about 23 percent were sold in US alone. ""The US alone contributed over a fifth of JLR's total revenue last year, making it a crucial market. With limited options to maintain margins and meet prior guidance, JLR will likely resort to price hikes and cost efficiencies. However, these strategies won’t yield immediate results, and a near-term hit to both revenue and profitability is expected,"" said Nirav Karkera, Head of Research at Fisdom. ""If JLR can raise prices proportionally, the revenue impact will be minimal. However, if demand falls due to higher prices, both sales volume and margins will suffer,” said Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Research and Wealth Management at Motilal Oswal in a conversation with Moneycontrol.

The selloff in automotive stocks with exposure to US spilled on to domestic-oriented companies as well, with Maruti Suzuki shares dropped nearly 2 percent, while Mahindra & Mahindra shares closed with marginal losses. Nifty Auto index tumbled nearly 3 percent on April 4. Shares of auto component makers like Sona BLW Precision and Samvardhana Motherson also saw a significant decline in their share prices, falling over 6 percent and 7 percent respectively. Vaibhav Porwal, Co-Founder of investment solutions company Dezerv said, ""Export-driven sectors like Information Technology and auto components face significant challenges as they are directly exposed to tariff impacts and broader global trade friction. In this market environment, gains will likely be concentrated in select stocks rather than broadly distributed, making careful stock selection and active management strategies more effective than passive approaches."" Nikunj Saraf from Choice Wealth, said, ""The 26% US tariff on Indian exports introduces near-term economic headwinds, affecting key industries like automobiles, textiles, and gems & jewellery."" During the tariff announcement from the White House on April 2, President Trump had cited high tariff by trading partners to argue for the tariffs. ""Toyota sells one million foreign-made automobiles in the US and General Motors almost sells none. Ford sells very little. None of our companies are allowed to go into other countries,"" Donald Trump had said. ""In many cases, the friend is worse than foe in terms of trade. Such horrendous imbalances have devastated our industrial base, and put our national security at risk.,"" Trump added.

"UBS gets constructive on top PSU lenders, upgrades SBI to ‘Neutral’, BoB a ‘Buy’",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/ubs-gets-constructive-on-top-psu-lenders-upgrades-sbi-to-neutral-bob-a-buy-12984581.html,"Leading brokerage UBS has revised its ratings on two major PSU banks, upgrading State Bank of India to ‘Neutral’ from ‘Sell’ and Bank of Baroda to ‘Buy’ from ‘Neutral’, citing stabilizing metrics and more attractive valuations behind the upgrades. Read More: LIVE Updates and News UBS said the recent policy developments and a stronger liquidity position are promising signs for SBI. The stock has seen a modest gain of around a percent in the past year compared to Bank Nifty’s 8% rise. The largest PSU lender is expected to benefit from tax rebate in the budget and the likely rollout of the Eighth Pay Commission recommendation. UBS said SBI’s liquidity has improved, reporting a surplus of about Rs 8 lakh crore in March, in contrast to a peak deficit of Rs 3.3 lakh crore earlier. UBS also raised its earnings per share (EPS) estimates for SBI by 3-5 percent, however, it remains cautious due to SBI’s relatively low Common Equity Tier I (CET I) ratio of about 11% compared to peers like HDFC Bank (17.5 percent) and ICICI Bank (16 percent). UBS said while there are positives, the balanced risk-reward profile justifies the ‘Neutral’ stance, with a revised price target of Rs 840 per share, up from the previous Rs 760. UBS upgraded Bank of Baroda to ‘Buy’, pointing to a stabilizing outlook and favourable valuations. Although BoB has faced challenges like weak NII growth and sluggish loan expansion, UBS sees reasons for optimism. Loan growth, which has remained below 12% YoY, is expected to pick up pace, supported by a healthier mix of retail loans and stable corporate asset quality. Additionally, BoB's liquidity ratios—such as a strong LCR of around 130% and an LDR of about 83%—are likely to support future loan growth, UBS said. The note said that recent correction of around 16% in BoB's stock price makes it attractively valued, trading at 0.8x Sept FY26e Price to Book Value (P/BV). The brokerage has set a revised price target of Rs 290 per share, up from Rs 270. The recalibrated outlook on SBI and BoB reflects a nuanced view by UBS of the public sector banking space, highlighting both challenges and potential catalysts for growth.

"US equities bear the brunt of Trump tariffs, see worst fall among all nations",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/us-equities-take-the-brunt-of-trump-tariffs-see-worst-fall-among-all-nations-12984728.html,"US equity markets experienced the steepest declines among global indices on April 3, after President Donald Trump announced sweeping new tariffs. The move sparked concerns over rising inflation, slowing economic growth, and a potential escalation of global trade tensions. The S&P 500 shed around $2.4 trillion in market value—its sharpest single-day drop since March 2020—while the Nasdaq Composite plunged 5.97%, marking its largest decline since the same period. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 also recorded their worst performances since June 2020. In a research note, IFA Global stated, ""There is extreme uncertainty and panic following the announcement of reciprocal tariff rates."" The firm added that recession risks have risen sharply, with risk assets under intense pressure. Several countries have responded with retaliatory measures. French President Emmanuel Macron urged companies to pause investments in the US., while Canada imposed a 25% retaliatory tariff on American-made vehicles. Ritesh Jain, founder of Pinetree Macro, noted that the disproportionate impact on U.S. equities, combined with a weakening dollar, is highly unusual. ""This indicates that liquidity and capital are beginning to shift away from U.S. markets toward other global assets. I believe this marks the beginning of the end of U.S. market exceptionalism,"" Jain said. Investors reacted sharply to the newly imposed 10% baseline tariff on imports and the prospect of countermeasures from trading partners. Fears of an escalating trade war have amplified concerns about a global economic slowdown and rising consumer prices, exacerbating vulnerabilities in an already delicate post-pandemic recovery. Global markets mirrored Wall Street’s decline. The FTSE 100 fell 3.3%, France’s CAC 40 dropped 3%, Japan’s Nikkei declined 2.77%, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng slipped 1.5%, China’s CSI 300 edged down 0.6%, and South Korea’s Kospi retreated 0.8%. India’s benchmark indices, the Sensex and Nifty, also closed 0.4% lower. Ajay Bagga, an independent market analyst, remarked that the newly dubbed ""Liberation Day"" tariffs significantly dampened investor sentiment. ""These 'Make America Wealth Again' tariffs are being viewed as counterproductive—they risk raising costs, reducing consumer choice, and suppressing demand,"" Bagga said. ""With uncertainty evolving into the certainty of economic and market disruption, we’re witnessing a flight to safety and a broad-based sell-off in risk assets,"" he added.

The revised price target implies a potential downside of 15 percent from current levels, making it the lowest target among analysts tracking the IndusInd Bank stock. At 10:40 am on April 4, IndusInd shares were trading 3% lower at Rs 686.5 apiece. READ MORE: LIVE updates and news stories UBS has flagged multiple risk factors that could lead to a further de-rating of IndusInd Bank. The brokerage expressed concerns over deposit flows, which it believes could significantly impact the bank’s financial stability. Another area of uncertainty is the appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer (CEO), which UBS sees as a potential risk factor. Additionally, the brokerage highlighted the importance of the findings from an external auditor's report, viewing them as critical indicators for the bank’s future performance. The brokerage has also revised its growth outlook for the bank. UBS has cut its loan growth estimate by 200 basis points to 10 percent, reflecting a more cautious view on the bank's lending capabilities. It has also reduced its Net Interest Margin (NIM) projections by around 20 to 25 basis points for financial years 2026 and 2027. Furthermore, credit costs are expected to remain elevated at approximately 1.7 percent in FY26, which could weigh on profitability. Consequently, UBS has trimmed its earnings per share (EPS) estimates by around 14 to 15 percent for both FY26 and FY27, driven mainly by lower margins and higher credit costs. Despite UBS's cautious stance, shares of IndusInd Bank closed 0.88 percent higher on Thursday at Rs 708.60. However, the stock has still fallen significantly—down about 55 percent from its recent high of Rs 1,576. Among the 47 analysts tracking the stock, opinions are divided, with 20 analysts giving a 'Buy' rating, 18 recommending 'Hold', and nine advising a 'Sell'. Meanwhile, IndusInd Bank has recently addressed speculation regarding a report from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) about alleged discrepancies in its derivatives portfolio. The bank clarified that it has not received any such report from external agencies conducting a review, countering earlier rumors that PwC would submit its findings on March 28. UBS's continued caution reflects the range of uncertainties clouding IndusInd Bank's outlook. With concerns around deposit flows, leadership transitions, and the external audit report, the brokerage remains wary of the bank's near-term prospects.",IndusInd bank shares fell 3% on April 4 as global brokerage firm UBS reiterated its bearish stance by maintaining a 'Sell' rating while sharply cutting the stock’s price target by 22 percent to Rs 600 from the earlier target of Rs 770.,IndusInd bank shares fell 3% on April 4 as global brokerage firm UBS reiterated its bearish stance by maintaining a 'Sell' rating while sharply cutting the stock’s price target by 22 percent to Rs 600 from the earlier target of Rs 770.,READ MORE: LIVE updates and news stories UBS has flagged multiple risk factors that could lead to a further de-rating of IndusInd Bank.,IndusInd bank shares fell 3% on April 4 as global brokerage firm UBS reiterated its bearish stance by maintaining a 'Sell' rating while sharply cutting the stock’s price target by 22 percent to Rs 600 from the earlier target of Rs 770.
"Trump promises 'never-seen-before' pharma tariffs soon; Nifty Pharma cracks 4.5%, IPCA Labs, Lupin sink 6%",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/why-pharma-stocks-aren-t-safe-trump-says-announcement-coming-in-near-future-12984490.html,"It ain’t over till it's over. US President Donald Trump said his administration is looking at possible tariffs on pharmaceuticals. “The pharma is going to be starting to come in at, I think, a level that you haven’t really seen before,” President Trump said speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One. Following this update, pharmaceutical stocks crashed, with the Nifty Pharma index emerging as the one of the top sectoral losers. At close, the pharma index settled lower by 4 percent, while constituents such as Aurobindo Pharma, Lupin, and IPCA Labs sank over six percent on April 4, 2025. “We are looking at pharma as a separate category -- we will be announcing that sometime in the near-future, not in the distant future”, Trump said. Earlier, Karoline Leavitt, White House Press Secretary, serving in President Donald Trump's administration since January 20, 2025 also hinted at moving pharmaceutical manufacturing back to the US. “We have outsourced our critical supplies chains in our countries. Do we want out life saving drugs and medicine and chips to be made in China or here in United States of America? This is a common sense policy,” said Leavitt. Follow our market blog to catch all the live updates In the previous session, domestic pharmaceutical players had heaved a sigh of relief in trade on April 3, while the other sectors saw intense selling pressure, as the White House had excluded pharmaceuticals products from the reciprocal tariffs announced by U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump unveiled his tariff plan for several U.S. trade partners on April 2, touted as 'Liberation Day', resulting in a ""discounted"" broad-based tariff of 26 percent on India. The is half of 52 percent that India supposedly charges U.S., including currency manipulation and trade barriers. All pharma imports to the U.S. were exempt from reciprocal tariffs, according to a White House factsheet. ""Some goods will not be subject to the Reciprocal Tariff. These include copper, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and lumber articles,"" said the document. Earlier, experts had noted that India’s pharma exports to the U.S. were largely generic formulations, which would make drug access to American citizens more expensive. As a result, they had suggested it was unlikely for tariffs to be imposed on this sector. However, following this update, pharmaceutical stocks might also be in for hefty tariffs.

The consolidation and rangebound trading may continue in the near term. Below are some trading ideas for the near term: Mandar Bhojane, Equity Research Analyst at Choice Broking Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders | CMP: Rs 2,737.55 Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders has broken out from a descending trendline. It has also retested the breakout level and formed a strong bullish candlestick pattern. A close above Rs 2,750 could trigger further momentum, with upside targets of Rs 3,200 and Rs 3,400 in the coming months. Technical indicators support the bullish outlook. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) is trending upward at 68.4, indicating strong buying strength. Additionally, the price is trading above all key exponential moving averages (20, 50, 100, and 200 EMA), reinforcing the stock’s bullish trend. On the downside, immediate support is near Rs 2,600, offering a dip-buying opportunity. If the stock corrects to this level, it may present a favourable risk-reward entry. A stop-loss at Rs 2,520 is recommended to manage risk effectively and protect against unexpected volatility. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,200, Rs 3,400 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,520 SJVN | CMP: Rs 95.77 SJVN is on the verge of breaking out from a falling trendline with significant volume. The price is consolidating just below the breakout level, indicating potential strength. If the stock closes above Rs 97, it could trigger a strong upward move, with targets of Rs 110 and Rs 120. On the downside, Rs 91 acts as immediate support, offering a buying opportunity on dips.

"PepsiCo agrees to meet with Al Sharpton over DEI cuts, potential boycott",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/pepsico-agrees-to-meet-with-al-sharpton-over-dei-cuts-potential-boycott-2025-04-14/,"Leaders at PepsiCo have agreed to meet this week with civil rights advocates from the National Action Network to discuss the company's recent decision to roll back some of its diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, the Reverend Al Sharpton said on Monday. In an April 4 letter to PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta, Sharpton threatened to lead a boycott against the company. PepsiCo — one of the largest food and beverage companies in North America whose brands include Gatorade, Lay’s potato chips, Doritos, Mountain Dew as well as Pepsi — told employees in February that the company will no longer set goals for minority representation in its managerial roles or supplier base. Sharpton said he will be meeting with Laguarta and he intends to press him on the specifics of the company's decision and what commitments it still has to ensuring equal opportunity in employment and contracts. A spokesperson for PepsiCo did not immediately respond to a request for comment. PepsiCo is one of several companies, including Walmart and Target, that have eliminated policies and programs aimed at increasing diversity among its employees and reducing discrimination against members of minority groups, women and LGBTQ+ people since President Donald Trump returned to the White House earlier this year. Trump ended DEI programswithin the federal government and has warned schools to do the same or risk losing federal money. In January, Sharpton led a “buy-cott” at Costco, encouraging Americans to vote with their dollars and shop at the retail giant for its commitment to DEI policies, even as many of its competitors phased them out. “That is the only viable tool that I see at this time, which is why we’ve rewarded those that stood with us,"" Sharpton told The Associated Press. Before you consider PepsiCo, you'll want to hear this.","Leaders at PepsiCo have agreed to meet this week with civil rights advocates from the National Action Network to discuss the company's recent decision to roll back some of its diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, the Reverend Al Sharpton said on Monday.",Sharpton said he will be meeting with Laguarta and he intends to press him on the specifics of the company's decision and what commitments it still has to ensuring equal opportunity in employment and contracts.,"In January, Sharpton led a “buy-cott” at Costco, encouraging Americans to vote with their dollars and shop at the retail giant for its commitment to DEI policies, even as many of its competitors phased them out.","Leaders at PepsiCo have agreed to meet this week with civil rights advocates from the National Action Network to discuss the company's recent decision to roll back some of its diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, the Reverend Al Sharpton said on Monday."

Denver Nuggets boss Josh Kroenke says firings of coach and GM were months in the making,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/denver-nuggets-boss-josh-kroenke-says-firings-of-coach-and-gm-were-months-in-the-making-2025-04-14/,"DENVER (AP) — Denver Nuggets boss Josh Kroenke said Monday that he twice balked at firing the winningest coach in franchise history and the general manager who connected the final pieces of the team's only championship puzzle before finally canning them last week with just three games left in the season. Kroenke held off in November to give the team time to jell and an eight-game winning streak heading into the All-Star break tempered his desire to part ways in February with coach Michael Malone and GM Calvin Booth. Kroenke finally fired both men last week in a move that stunned the league because the Nuggets had already secured a seventh consecutive playoff berth and were less than two years removed from the city's first NBA championship parade. “So, what would be crazier, me doing what I did last week or doing it on an eight-game winning streak?” Kroenke asked. Only one of those eight wins leading into the All-Star break came against a team that would make the playoffs, the Orlando Magic, the No. 7 seed in the East. “I think that those eight games masked a trend that was going on behind closed doors that ultimately started to really affect the end of our season,” Kroenke said. Kroenke said he also seriously considered a change around Thanksgiving with the Nuggets off to a so-so start and “I was really feeling like things weren't headed in the right direction.” But he said he held off then to give the team time to settle in. Despite leading Denver to its first title in 47 years, Malone and Booth long clashed over roster philosophies, a discord that led to a toxicity in the organization that began to affect the team’s fortunes and which led Kroenke to fire them both. The Nuggets won all three games under interim coach David Adelman to secure a third consecutive 50-win season and the fourth seed in the West, where they'll open at home Saturday against the fifth-seeded Los Angeles Clippers. Kroenke said he'll commence a search for both positions after the season but he demurred when asked if he wanted to have a GM in place before hiring a head coach: “My thoughts aren't there because this season's not over."" Kroenke also announced he'd promoted Ben Tenzer to interim GM for the playoff run. Kroenke began his nearly 30-minute news conference, his first since the firings, by praising Malone and Booth: “I want to start off by initially just staying thank you to both Calvin and Coach Malone ... And to be frank, neither one of them deserved it, so for that I apologize.” Kroenke said he ultimately made the decision to move on from both men “with the hope of kind of rejuvenating the energy of the group and re-establishing some positive thoughts before the playoffs. I think we did that over the last three games ... still have a long way to go."" Nikola Jokic is the gemstone of the Nuggets' roster and the changes at the helm were driven in part by the desire to capitalize on whatever prime playing years the three-time MVP has remaining. “You have a responsibility when you have a player like that, especially, obviously, in his prime,” Kroenke said. “But I feel an even greater responsibility to the person. ... I'd be the dumbest guy in basketball if I wasn't asking him for his opinion on certain things. But it's my responsibility to make those decisions for the best of the organization and I think Jokic understands and respects that.” Kroenke debunked the notion that he was unwilling to trade anyone not named Jokic, including fellow Missouri alum Michael Porter Jr., following reports that he nixed a deal for the long-range sharp-shooter at the trade deadline. “If it wasn't such a serious accusation, I would probably laugh a little harder,” Kroenke said. “I'd say any kind of report that we're not open to trading everybody possible to improve the team is completely false.” He added: “I'm certainly not going to be green-lighting any trades around here when I don't see complete organization cohesion and we're not maximizing the group we got.” Kroenke noted that he couldn't always be on hand at Ball Arena to police the winning culture that had started to ebb with Malone and Booth at odds. “I have a wide array of responsibilities across our businesses at this point,” Kroenke said of the family's sports empire, which includes the Los Angeles Rams, the Colorado Avalanche and English soccer club Arsenal. “I mean, last Tuesday was the craziest Tuesday that I could have ever imagined. I had the worst morning that I've had in over 10 years with the Nuggets followed by the most amazing afternoon I could have ever asked for with the Arsenal Football Club,"" Kroenke said. ""We beat Real Madrid 3-0 in the quarterfinals of the Champions League ... On a human level, that was a rough Tuesday for me. It was all over the place.” ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/nba",Kroenke held off in November to give the team time to jell and an eight-game winning streak heading into the All-Star break tempered his desire to part ways in February with coach Michael Malone and GM Calvin Booth.,"Kroenke began his nearly 30-minute news conference, his first since the firings, by praising Malone and Booth: “I want to start off by initially just staying thank you to both Calvin and Coach Malone ...

"Getting the IRS on the phone is more difficult this tax filing season, experts say",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/getting-the-irs-on-the-phone-is-more-difficult-this-tax-filing-season-experts-say-2025-04-14/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Taxpayers calling the IRS for help processing their taxes this filing season may find it harder than normal to get someone on the phone, experts say, a problem that is only expected to get worse next year with staffing cuts that could slash the workforce considerably. For this year, data of tax return processing times shows numbers largely in line with those from last year. IRS employees involved in the 2025 tax season were not allowed to accept a buyout offer from the Trump administration until after the taxpayer filing deadline of April 15, though thousands of probationary workers were laid off earlier this year. Legal experts in tax compliance say the long wait times are going to increase as more buyouts and layoffs take effect. Eric Santos, the executive director of the Georgia Tax Clinic, which provides free tax law services to low-income taxpayers, says wait times for the IRS’ phone line are markedly longer than usual and IRS staff are overwhelmed with the increase in work. The IRS staff ""basically tell us they don’t have time to look at certain cases,” Santos said. “The work is getting spread across fewer and fewer people.” The reduction in workers — which may end up being nearly half the entire IRS workforce — is part of the Trump administration’s efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce through billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency by closing agencies, laying off nearly all probationary employees who have not yet gained civil service protection and offering buyouts to almost all federal employees through a “deferred resignation program.” Earlier this month, the IRS began layoffs that could end up cutting as many as 20,000 staffers — up to 25% of the total workforce. The roughly 7,000 probationary IRS workers who were laid off beginning in February were recently ordered to be reinstated by a federal judge, though it's unclear whether those workers have been called back into work. Comparing figures through the first week of April from 2024 and 2025, 101.4 million returns were processed this year compared to 101.8 million tax returns last year. Refunds are up, with 67.7 million issued this year compared with 66.7 million in 2024. But Santos and others worry that the 2026 filing season could be negatively impacted by the loss of thousands of additional tax collection workers who are expected to exit the agency through planned layoffs and buyouts. “I don’t see how they’re going to keep up with tax filing season next year,” Santos said. “I think its a fair question to ask now.” A Treasury spokesperson who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity said in a statement that IRS staffing reductions were part of other improvements the agency is taking to be more efficient and improve service. Sakinah Tillman, director of the University of the District of Columbia Tax Clinic, has not seen a delay in processing refunds this year but has seen delays in reaching the IRS by phone. She worries that the phone delays could hurt clients going through collections who are trying to settle their debts. “What happens when clients try to become compliant?"" she asked. ""Or when people who are willing and able to pay but they just can’t get someone on the phone? Former IRS Commissioner John Koskinen told the AP that even in a normal year the IRS' responsiveness slows the further into tax season it gets. “Next year, if they cut 10,000 or 20,000 employees, they're headed back to really bad taxpayer service on the phone,” he said. ""And the taxpayer priority line will become an oxymoron.”",But Santos and others worry that the 2026 filing season could be negatively impacted by the loss of thousands of additional tax collection workers who are expected to exit the agency through planned layoffs and buyouts.,"“The work is getting spread across fewer and fewer people.” The reduction in workers — which may end up being nearly half the entire IRS workforce — is part of the Trump administration’s efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce through billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency by closing agencies, laying off nearly all probationary employees who have not yet gained civil service protection and offering buyouts to almost all federal employees through a “deferred resignation program.” Earlier this month, the IRS began layoffs that could end up cutting as many as 20,000 staffers — up to 25% of the total workforce.",Legal experts in tax compliance say the long wait times are going to increase as more buyouts and layoffs take effect.,"“The work is getting spread across fewer and fewer people.” The reduction in workers — which may end up being nearly half the entire IRS workforce — is part of the Trump administration’s efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce through billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency by closing agencies, laying off nearly all probationary employees who have not yet gained civil service protection and offering buyouts to almost all federal employees through a “deferred resignation program.” Earlier this month, the IRS began layoffs that could end up cutting as many as 20,000 staffers — up to 25% of the total workforce."
Confusion reigns after Trump exempts electronics from new tariff regime. Here's what we know,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/confusion-reigns-after-trump-exempts-electronics-from-new-tariff-regime-heres-what-we-know-2025-04-14/,"Confusion over President Donald Trump’s tariffs remains following a weekend of questions around trade in consumer electronics. On Friday the Trump administration paused its new taxes on electronics imported into the U.S. — signaling some relief from trade wars that have particularly escalated with China, a major exporter of technology from smartphones to laptops. But these goods remain subject to other levies. And officials have also indicated that additional, sector-specific tariffs targeting electronics are on the way — all of which economists warn will raise costs and lead to higher prices for consumers. Here's what we know. Late Friday, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection said that electronics, including smartphones and laptops, would be excluded from broader, so-called “reciprocal” tariffs — meaning these goods wouldn't be subject to most tariffs levied on China to date or the 10% baseline levies imposed on other countries. But U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick later said that this was only a temporary reprieve — telling ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday that electronics will be included under future sector-specific tariffs on semiconductor products, set to arrive in ""probably a month or two.” And not all of the levies that the U.S. has imposed on countries like China fall under the White House's “reciprocal” categorization. Hours after Lutnick's comments, Trump declared on social media that there was no “exception” at all, adding to confusion. Trump instead argued that these goods are “just moving to a different” bucket. He also said that China will still face a 20% levy on electronics imports as part of his administration’s prior move related to fentanyl trafficking. On Sunday, China’s commerce ministry welcomed a partial reprieve on consumer electronics — but continued to call for the U.S. to completely cancel the rest of its tariffs. Chinese President Xi Jinping reiterated that on Monday, writing in an editorial jointly published in Vietnamese and Chinese official media that ""there are no winners in a trade war.” He added that both China and the U.S. “should resolutely safeguard the multilateral trading system, stable global industrial and supply chains, and open and cooperative international environment.” Tit-for-tat tariffs between the U.S. and China have escalated to new heights over recent months. Since taking office in January, Trump has imposed a series of levies that now amount to 145% taxes on a range of imports from the country. In response, China has hit back with its own measures, including tariffs on U.S. goods that currently total 125%. Its Commerce Ministry has also said it will impose more export controls on rare earths, used in high-tech products such as computer chips and electric vehicle batteries. Tariffs are taxes on goods imported from other countries. And because so many of the electronics we buy rely on a global supply chain, economists have warned that tariffs impacting consumer technology could mean higher prices for your next smartphone, computer or other gadgets. Reducing the size of those tariffs, even temporarily, could delay or lessen that impact. But it's unlikely that price hikes will be totally avoided. Electronics will still be taxed by previous (non-""reciprocal”) tariffs — and potentially under additional, sector-specific levies down the road. It would also be incredibly difficult for companies to change their supply chains. The Trump administration argues that tariffs will entice big names like Apple, for example, to make iPhones in the U.S. for the first time. But Apple has spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China — and it would take years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S. Wendong Zhang, an assistant professor of applied economics and policy at Cornell University, says the tariffs' impact on consumer tech reflects how difficult a “full decoupling between U.S. and China” is. Products like laptops, smartphones and the components needed to make them accounted for nearly $174 billion in U.S. imports from China last year. Trump signaled on Monday that he had spoken to Apple CEO Tim Cook before exempting electronics from some of his China tariffs — telling reporters that he had “helped” Cook with the partial reprieve, while separately saying he plans to provide temporary exemptions for auto makers that may also need “a little bit of time.” Apple did not immediately respond to The Associated Press' request for statement. Tariffs have plunged financial markets worldwide into turmoil — particularly battering stocks following of Trump's sweeping announcement on April 2. That cooled after news of this partial electronics exemption, as well as last week's pause of steeper tariffs outside of China. On Monday, the S&P 500 climbed 0.8%, though trading was still shaky, and it briefly gave back all of its big early gain of 1.8%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 312 points, or 0.8%, and the Nasdaq composite added 0.6%. Still, the relief could be fleeting. While the partial electronics reprieve indicates that Trump is watching markets, Zhang notes, it and other looming actions also show that the administration’s “tariff strategy is a lot more about the leverage and signaling ... as opposed to coherent long term trade framework.” Overall, uncertainty remains high — making it hard for many companies trying to solidify long-term plans when conditions seem to change daily. “Businesses thrive on stability because they plan around rules of engagement ... Ergo, markets perform better when businesses are confident that the rules are really the rules,” Dipanjan Chatterjee, vice president and principal analyst at Forrester, wrote in a Monday note. Still, he added, businesses will need to avoid knee-jerk reactions while evaluating risk. “When Friday’s policies are thrown out with Sunday’s brunch leftovers, companies will resort to one primary strategy: do as little as possible and thereby do no harm.” _______ AP Writers Josh Boak in Washington, Mae Anderson in Nashville, Tennessee and Matt O'Brien in Providence, Rhode Island, contributed to this report.","On Friday the Trump administration paused its new taxes on electronics imported into the U.S. — signaling some relief from trade wars that have particularly escalated with China, a major exporter of technology from smartphones to laptops.","But U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick later said that this was only a temporary reprieve — telling ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday that electronics will be included under future sector-specific tariffs on semiconductor products, set to arrive in ""probably a month or two.” And not all of the levies that the U.S. has imposed on countries like China fall under the White House's “reciprocal” categorization.","And because so many of the electronics we buy rely on a global supply chain, economists have warned that tariffs impacting consumer technology could mean higher prices for your next smartphone, computer or other gadgets.","Chinese President Xi Jinping reiterated that on Monday, writing in an editorial jointly published in Vietnamese and Chinese official media that ""there are no winners in a trade war.” He added that both China and the U.S. “should resolutely safeguard the multilateral trading system, stable global industrial and supply chains, and open and cooperative international environment.” Tit-for-tat tariffs between the U.S. and China have escalated to new heights over recent months."

Keystone Pipeline restarted after oil spill in rural North Dakota,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/company-plans-to-restart-keystone-pipeline-after-oil-spill-in-rural-north-dakota-2025-04-14/,"BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — The operator of the Keystone oil pipeline restarted the system Monday after a spill onto farmland in North Dakota last week shut down the line. South Bow said it was watching inclement weather conditions before beginning “a carefully controlled restart” that will include 24/7 monitoring, reduced operating pressures, cleanup of the site and compliance with federal regulators' requirements. The federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration said South Bow restarted the pipeline at a reduced pressure. The failed section was dug out and replaced and will be taken to a metallurgical lab in Houston for testing, while the repaired pipeline will be tested at different pressures to ensure its integrity, PHMSA said. The agency's investigation is ongoing. It is unclear what caused the spill. The company said it has finished all repairs, inspections and testing at the spill site. PHMSA said it signed off on the company's restart plan. South Bow also said it will put certain pressure restrictions on the pipeline's Canadian sections, and has shared those details with Canadian regulators. The company's update did not mention a cause of the spill, though the company said it would share investigation findings when available. An employee heard a “mechanical bang"" and shut down the pipeline within two minutes, a state spill response official previously said. The spill is estimated at 3,500 barrels, or 147,000 gallons. Vacuum trucks had recovered 1,170 barrels of crude oil, or 49,140 gallons, as of early Friday, according to PHMSA. The spill occurred in a field north of Fort Ransom, North Dakota, a tiny town in a forested area known for scenic views and outdoor recreation. The 2,689-mile (4,327 kilometers) Keystone Pipeline carries crude oil from Alberta, Canada, to refineries in Illinois, Oklahoma and Texas. The pipeline was shut down from Alberta to points in Illinois and a liquid tank terminal Oklahoma, though the line remained open between Oklahoma and Texas' Gulf Coast, according to a map from South Bow. Lower oil prices due to tariff issues helped mute challenges from the pipeline shutdown on gas prices, though diesel prices could still inch up, said Ramanan Krishnamoorti, vice president for energy and innovation at the University of Houston. Gas prices have fallen in almost every state in the last week due to the oil price drop resulting from the tariff and trade war concerns, said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis for GasBuddy, which tracks gas prices. “I wouldn't have expected this to really have much of an impact anyway, but with oil prices actively having plummeted over the last week, yes, I would say that the decline was more than offset,” he said.","BISMARCK, N.D.

Why NVIDIA Stock Could Soar Despite Wall Street Downgrades,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/why-nvidia-stock-could-soar-despite-wall-street-downgrades/,"NVIDIA NASDAQ: NVDA analysts started reducing their ratings and price targets in late March, which presents a headwind for the stock price action. MarketBeat tracks five consecutive negative revisions beginning March 20, including three price target reductions and two downgrades. The downgrades are from Buy or Strong Buy to Hold, and the net result could be a cap on the market. Regardless of where the consensus target forecasts the stock price, a trend in negative revisions saps investor appetite. This could lead to an even deeper market correction than NVIDIA has already seen. The risk now is that negative revisions will become the trend. However, not all analysts are cutting their targets. The five-revision trend that began in late March ended in mid-April when Bank of America reiterated its rating and target. Analysts at Bank of America peg this stock at Moderate Buy, aligning with the broad consensus, and see it advancing to $200 or nearly 80% upside relative to the April 14th price action. They cite the tariff pause as a catalyst for the business. While the pause does not end the risk of tariffs, it is seen as a catalyst for policy action on Capitol Hill to support and accelerate the onshoring of U.S. semiconductor manufacturing. NVIDIA plans to manufacture half a trillion dollars in AI infrastructure domestically within four years. The bold claim is supported by ongoing investment in Arizona and Texas facilities, including Taiwan Semiconductor NYSE: TSM and Foxconn, which are intended to ramp up production for NVIDIA and other prominent semiconductor firms. The goal for NVIDIA is for 100% domestic production of its most advanced chips, including Blackwell and Rubin line-ups, front and back end, packaging, and testing. As it is, the company expects to begin ramping up domestic production at two Texas facilities within the next 12 to 15 months. It has already commissioned more than 1 million square feet of manufacturing space. As much risk as there is for NVIDIA analysts to cap gains in 2025, the downside is limited because of the stock’s low valuation and outlook for business growth. NVIDIA revenue growth is expected to continue slowing due to the law of large numbers and maturing AI markets, but it will sustain a moderate to low double-digit pace through the end of the next decade. This forecast puts the stock under 10x its earnings by the middle of the next decade, presenting a generational buying opportunity. The stock price could easily double in this scenario, and the odds are high that it will rise significantly more because the forecasts are likely too low. Clouds and economic headwinds in early 2025 impacted the outlook, but when they ease, global business, including AI infrastructure build, can regain momentum. The catalyst could come with the Q2 earnings report due at the end of May, when the company issues another solid report and provides positive guidance. Because of the technical setup and analyst forecasts, NVIDIA could set new highs before its Q2 earnings report is released. Although some analysts have trimmed targets and the consensus has fallen from a peak, it forecasts a 50% upside for this stock, sufficient to exceed the current all-time high by 1500 basis points and could be reached quickly. Once this market clearly indicates it is moving higher, investor capital will start to flood into it and drive the stock price to the $190 range or higher.

"Here's a look at recent aircraft tragedies, mishaps and close calls",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/heres-a-look-at-recent-aircraft-tragedies-mishaps-and-close-calls-2025-04-14/,"The crash of a small plane in New York over the weekend killed all six on board — a physician couple and their accomplished children and partners — during a family trip to the Catskills. It's the latest in a series of aviation disasters at a time of heightened scrutiny of aircraft collisions and near-misses. The most deadly was the collision of a passenger jet and a military helicopter over the Potomac River that that killed 67 people in January. In February, one airliner clipped another while taxiing at the Seattle airport. In March, an American Airlines plane caught fire after landing in Denver, sending 12 people to the hospital. Federal officials have tried to reassure travelers that flying is the safest mode of transportation, and statistics support that. But the cascade of headlines about things going wrong is drawing increasing attention amid declining confidence in air travel and cuts at the Federal Aviation Administration, part of President Donald Trump's efforts to downsize the federal government. Here is a look at some of the recent aircraft tragedies and mishaps: — The twin-engine Mitsubishi MU-2B went down shortly after noon Saturday in a muddy field in Copake, New York, near the Massachusetts line, shortly after the pilot radioed air traffic control at Columbia County Airport to say he had missed the initial approach and requested a new landing plan. — Six people were killed this month when a sightseeing helicopter broke apart and crashed into the Hudson River. The helicopter lifted off from a New York City heliport, flying north along the Manhattan skyline and then south toward the Statue of Liberty before hitting the water. The pilot was killed along with a family from Spain that was celebrating the ninth birthday of one of their children. — Three people were killed and one was injured when a small plane crashed Friday morning near an interstate highway and pushed a car onto railroad tracks in Boca Raton, Florida. — Two small planes collided near an Arizona airport in mid-February. One managed to land uneventfully, but the other hit the ground near a runway and caught fire, killing two people at Marana Regional Airport near Tucson. — A small commuter plane crashed in western Alaska in early February, killing all 10 people on board. The crash was one of the deadliest in the state in 25 years. Radar data indicated that the plane rapidly lost elevation after an air traffic controller told it to slow down in icy weather so the runway at their destination could be de-iced. — A medical transport plane plummeted into a Philadelphia neighborhood after taking off in January, killing all six people on board and one person on the ground. The National Transportation Safety Board said its cockpit voice recorder likely hadn't been functioning for years. The crew made no distress calls to air traffic control. — The collision between an American Airlines passenger jet and an Army helicopter above the nation's capital killed everyone aboard both aircraft in late January. It was the deadliest plane crash in the U.S. since Nov. 12, 2001, when a jet slammed into a New York City neighborhood just after takeoff, killing all 260 people on board and five on the ground. — A jetliner operated by Jeju Air skidded off a runway, slammed into a concrete fence and burst into flames in December after its landing gear apparently failed to deploy, killing all but two of the 181 people aboard in one of South Korea's worst aviation disasters. — The American Airlines plane that caught fire at Denver International Airport in March had been diverted there because the crew reported engine vibrations. While taxiing to the gate, an engine caught fire, prompting slides to be deployed so that passengers could evacuate quickly. The people taken to hospitals had minor injuries. — A single-engine plane carrying five people crashed and burst into flames in the parking lot of a retirement community near a small airport outside Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in March. Everyone on board survived. Three people were taken to a burn center. — A Delta Air Lines jet flipped over while landing at Toronto’s Pearson Airport in February. All 80 people on board survived, but some people received minor injuries. Witnesses and video from the scene showed the plane landing so hard that its right wing was sheared off. Investigators were examining the weather conditions and the possibility of human error. — In April, on the same day as the fatal New York helicopter crash, a wing tip of an American Airlines plane struck another plane from the same airline on a taxiway of the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. There were no reported injuries. Multiple members of Congress were aboard one of the flights. — A FedEx cargo plane made an emergency landing at a busy New Jersey airport in March after a bird strike caused an engine fire that could be seen in the morning sky. The plane landed at Newark Liberty International Airport. There were no reported injuries. — Pilots on a Southwest Airlines flight about to land at Chicago’s Midway Airport were forced to climb back into the sky to avoid another aircraft crossing the runway in February. Video showed the plane approaching the runway before it abruptly pulled up as a business jet taxied onto the runway without authorization, federal officials said. — In February, a Japan Airlines plane was taxiing on the tarmac of Seattle-Tacoma International Airport when it apparently clipped the tail of a parked Delta plane. There were no injuries reported. — In January, passengers panicked when a man aboard a JetBlue plane that was taxiing for takeoff from Boston's Logan International Airport opened an exit door over a wing, trigging an emergency slide to inflate. Other passengers quickly restrained the man and the plane didn't take off.","It was the deadliest plane crash in the U.S. since Nov. 12, 2001, when a jet slammed into a New York City neighborhood just after takeoff, killing all 260 people on board and five on the ground.","It was the deadliest plane crash in the U.S. since Nov. 12, 2001, when a jet slammed into a New York City neighborhood just after takeoff, killing all 260 people on board and five on the ground.",— Six people were killed this month when a sightseeing helicopter broke apart and crashed into the Hudson River.,"Here is a look at some of the recent aircraft tragedies and mishaps: — The twin-engine Mitsubishi MU-2B went down shortly after noon Saturday in a muddy field in Copake, New York, near the Massachusetts line, shortly after the pilot radioed air traffic control at Columbia County Airport to say he had missed the initial approach and requested a new landing plan."
How to Maximize Your Property Investment Profits as the 2025 Rental Season Begins,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/how-to-maximize-your-property-investment-profits-as-the-2025-rental-season-begins-2025-04-14/,"When considering how to evaluate an investment to maximize profits, your chief concern should be limiting vacancies and filling the ones that do occur as quickly as possible. An empty investment property is not an investment property at all: It's a money pit. You must tailor your advertising efforts to consider who your ideal renter is. Renters in 2025 tend to search for listings online, whether through a listing site or social media platforms. Renters know what to look for in an investment property; you just have to show them those desirable traits within your own property on the platforms they will encounter your listing on. Related: How to Avoid Long-Term Rental Vacancies and Safeguard Revenue Online listings are extremely important in this digital age to bring in potential tenants and fill vacancies. As a landlord, vacant properties are detrimental to your ability to turn profit. Learning how to write an effective and engaging listing will help bring in as many interested renters as possible. Here are the three main components of a listing and some tips on how to master each one: Headline: The headline is the part of the listing that a potential renter sees first. They will judge whether they want to inquire further based on the heading you chose, so make sure it's a good one! The best headings are brief yet informative. The aspects of a property that renters are interested in most are the price, square footage, neighborhood and whatever features or amenities you think they'd be most interested in knowing about. Pictures: Besides your headline, the pictures in your listing will be the main attention-grabber in your listing. You need to ensure each photograph in your listing is high-quality, using a decent camera, tripod and uploaded on a high-quality file. Taking pictures during daylight hours is recommended, since natural light is most flattering. Artificial light can occasionally make a space look dingy or run-down. Sometimes, attaching a floor plan to your listing can help renters visualize where each room fits in the overall layout of the property. Description: When an interested renter makes it to your description, they've already looked at the heading and presumably skimmed through the pictures. The description is your chance to fill in any property details that are relevant and interesting to them, while still trying to persuade them that this could be their next investment. It can be easier for renters to digest description information if you put the following information in a bulleted list. Consider inserting information about amenities, dimensions, measurements and important lease terms. It's very important to remember to include your phone and email so anyone interested in the property has a way to reach you. Related: 7 Tips for Writing Engaging Listings for Your Rental Property Once you have your quality listing, you'll have to post it to a listing site so potential tenants can see it. Commercial listing sites like CoStar, LoopNet and Crexi can help you get your listing to thousands of eyes. If you'd like to attract a younger audience or simply expand the reach of your advertising efforts, consider using social media apps like Instagram, Facebook and TikTok. Each of these apps has a different audience — for example, Instagram and Facebook boast more millennial users than TikTok, which is more popular with Gen Z. Carefully consider what type of tenant you think would be interested in your property and then curate your social media strategy accordingly. It can be advantageous to hire a social media strategist or intern who is familiar with the trends for these sites. Going viral is not easy. If you're serious about launching a social media strategy, talk to other professionals or real estate investors who have forayed into this territory for advice. Finally, ensure that you're following all terms and conditions associated with advertising your business on social media. Each app has different rules and regulations, so to avoid being banned from the platform, read through each one's guidelines for advertising.

Trump considers pausing his auto tariffs as the world economy endures whiplash,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-considers-pausing-his-auto-tariffs-as-the-world-economy-endures-whiplash-2025-04-14/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Monday suggested that he might temporarily exempt the auto industry from tariffs he previously imposed on the sector, to give carmakers time to adjust their supply chains. “I’m looking at something to help some of the car companies with it,” Trump told reporters gathered in the Oval Office. The Republican president said automakers needed time to relocate production from Canada, Mexico and other places, ""And they need a little bit of time because they’re going to make them here, but they need a little bit of time. So I’m talking about things like that.” Matt Blunt, president of American Automotive Policy Council, an association representing Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, said the group shared Trump's goals of increased domestic production. “There is increasing awareness that broad tariffs on parts could undermine our shared goal of building a thriving and growing American auto industry, and that many of these supply chain transitions will take time,"" Blunt said. Trump's statement hinted at yet another round of reversals on tariffs as Trump's onslaught of import taxes has panicked financial markets and raised deep concerns from Wall Street economists about a possible recession. When Trump announced the 25% auto tariffs on March 27, he described them as “permanent.” His hard lines on trade have become increasingly blurred as he has sought to limit the possible economic and political blowback from his policies. Last week, after a bond market sell-off pushed up interest rates on U.S. debt, Trump announced that for 90 days his broader tariffs against dozens of countries would instead be set at a baseline 10% to give time for negotiations. At the same time, Trump increased the import taxes on China to 145%, only to temporarily exempt electronics from some of those tariffs by having those goods charged at a 20% rate. “I don’t change my mind, but I’m flexible,” Trump said Monday. Trump's flexibility has also fueled a sense of uncertainty and confusion about his intentions and end goals. The S&P 500 stock index was up 0.8% Monday, but it's still down nearly 8% this year. Interest rates on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes were elevated at roughly 4.4%. Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist for the Northern Trust global financial firm, said the whiplash had been so great that he might have to “get fitted for a neck brace.” Tannenbaum warned in an analysis: “Damage to consumer, business, and market confidence may already be irreversible.” Maroš Šefčovič, the European commissioner for trade and economic security, posted on X on Monday that on behalf of the European Union he engaged in trade negotiations with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. ""The EU remains constructive and ready for a fair deal — including reciprocity through our 0-for-0 tariff offer on industrial goods and the work on non-tariff barriers,"" Šefčovič said. The U.S. president also said that he spoke with Apple CEO Tim Cook and “helped” him recently. Many Apple products, including its popular iPhone, are assembled in China. Apple didn’t respond to a Monday request for comment about the latest swings in the Trump administration’s tariff pendulum. Even if the exemptions granted on electronics last week turn out to be short-lived, the temporary reprieve gives Apple some breathing room to figure out ways to minimize the trade war’s impact on its iPhone sales in the U.S. That prospect helped lift Apple’s stock price 2% on Monday. Still, the stock gave up some of its earlier 7% increase as investors processed the possibility that the iPhone could still be jolted by more tariffs on Chinese-made products in the weeks ahead. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said Apple is clearly in a far better position than it was a week ago, but he warned there's still “mass uncertainty, chaos, and confusion about the next steps ahead.” One possible workaround Apple may be examining during the current tariff reprieve is how to shift even more of its iPhone production from its longtime hubs in China to India, where it began expanding its manufacturing while Trump waged a trade war during his first term as president. The Trump administration has suggested that its tariffs had isolated China as the U.S. engaged in talks with other countries. But China is also seeking to build tighter relationships in Asia with nations stung by Trump's tariffs. China’s leader, Xi Jinping, on Monday met in Hanoi with Vietnam's Communist Party General Secretary To Lam with the message that no one wins in trade wars. Asked about the meeting, Trump suggested the two nations were conspiring to do economic harm to the U.S. by “trying to figure out how do we screw the United States of America.” ___ Liedtke reported from San Francisco.","Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist for the Northern Trust global financial firm, said the whiplash had been so great that he might have to “get fitted for a neck brace.” Tannenbaum warned in an analysis: “Damage to consumer, business, and market confidence may already be irreversible.” Maroš Šefčovič, the European commissioner for trade and economic security, posted on X on Monday that on behalf of the European Union he engaged in trade negotiations with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer.","Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said Apple is clearly in a far better position than it was a week ago, but he warned there's still “mass uncertainty, chaos, and confusion about the next steps ahead.” One possible workaround Apple may be examining during the current tariff reprieve is how to shift even more of its iPhone production from its longtime hubs in China to India, where it began expanding its manufacturing while Trump waged a trade war during his first term as president.","Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said Apple is clearly in a far better position than it was a week ago, but he warned there's still “mass uncertainty, chaos, and confusion about the next steps ahead.” One possible workaround Apple may be examining during the current tariff reprieve is how to shift even more of its iPhone production from its longtime hubs in China to India, where it began expanding its manufacturing while Trump waged a trade war during his first term as president.","Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist for the Northern Trust global financial firm, said the whiplash had been so great that he might have to “get fitted for a neck brace.” Tannenbaum warned in an analysis: “Damage to consumer, business, and market confidence may already be irreversible.” Maroš Šefčovič, the European commissioner for trade and economic security, posted on X on Monday that on behalf of the European Union he engaged in trade negotiations with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer."
"Despite a court order, White House bars AP from Oval Office event",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/despite-a-court-order-white-house-bars-ap-from-oval-office-event-2025-04-14/,"Despite a court order, a reporter and photographer from The Associated Press were barred from an Oval Office news conference on Monday with President Donald Trump and his counterpart from El Salvador, Nayib Bukele. Last week's federal court decision forbidding the Trump administration from punishing the AP for refusing to rename the Gulf of Mexico was to take effect Monday. The administration is appealing the decision and arguing with the news outlet over whether it needs to change anything until those appeals are exhausted. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. circuit set a Thursday hearing on Trump's request that any changes be delayed while case is reviewed. The AP is fighting for more access as soon as possible. Since mid-February, AP reporters and photographers have been blocked from attending events in the Oval Office, where President Donald Trump frequently addresses journalists, and on Air Force One. The AP has seen sporadic access elsewhere, and regularly covers White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt’s briefings. Leavitt is one of three administration officials named in the AP's lawsuit. The dispute stems from AP’s decision not to follow the president’s executive order to rename the Gulf of Mexico, although AP style does cite Trump’s wish that it be called the Gulf of America. The AP argued – and U.S. District Judge Trevor N. McFadden agreed last week – that the government cannot punish the news organization for exercising its right to free speech. McFadden on Friday had rejected Trump’s request for more delay in implementing the ruling; now the president is asking an appeals court for the same thing. “We expect the White House to restore AP's participation in the (White House press) pool as of today, as provided in the injunction order,” AP spokeswoman Lauren Easton said Monday. The extent of AP's future access remains uncertain, even with the court decision. Until being blocked by Trump, AP has traditionally always had a reporter and photographer among the small group of journalists invited into the Oval Office. McFadden did not order that to be restored, only that no news organization should be shut out because the president objects to its news decisions — under a principle called “viewpoint discrimination.” “No other news organization in the United States receives the level of guaranteed access previously bestowed upon the AP,” the administration argued in court papers over the weekend. “The AP may have grown accustomed to its favored status, but the Constitution does not require that such status endure in perpetuity.” ___ David Bauder writes about media for the AP.

Nvidia plans to manufacture AI chips in the US for the first time,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/nvidia-plans-to-manufacture-ai-chips-in-the-us-for-the-first-time-2025-04-14/,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Nvidia announced Monday that it will produce its artificial intelligence super computers in the United States for the first time. The tech giant said it has commissioned more than one million square feet of manufacturing space to build and test its specialized Blackwell chips in Arizona and AI supercomputers in Texas — part of an investment the company said will produce up to half a trillion dollars of AI infrastructure in the next four years. “The engines of the world’s AI infrastructure are being built in the United States for the first time,” Nvidia founder Jensen Huang said in a statement. “Adding American manufacturing helps us better meet the incredible and growing demand for AI chips and supercomputers, strengthens our supply chain and boosts our resiliency.” Nvidia’s announcement comes as the Trump administration has said that tariff exemptions on electronics like smartphones and laptops are only a temporary reprieve until officials develop a new tariff approach specific to the semiconductor industry. White House officials, including President Donald Trump himself, spent Sunday downplaying the significance of exemptions that lessen but won’t eliminate the effect of U.S. tariffs on imports of popular consumer devices and their key components. “They’re exempt from the reciprocal tariffs but they’re included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two,” U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday. Nvidia said in a post on its website that it has started Blackwell production at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. chip plants in Phoenix. The Santa Clara, California-based chip company is also building supercomputer manufacturing plants in Texas — with Foxconn in Houston and Wistron in Dallas. Nvidia's AI super computers will serve as the engines for AI factories, “a new type of data center created for the sole purpose of processing artificial intelligence,” the company said, adding that manufacturing in the U.S. will create “hundreds of thousands of jobs and drive trillions of dollars in economic security over the coming decades."" Mass production at both plants is expected to ramp up in the next 12-15 months, Nvidia said. The company also plans on partnering with Taiwan-based company SPIL and Amkor for “packaging and testing operations” in Arizona. In a statement Monday, the White House called Nvidia’s move “the Trump Effect in action.” Trump “has made U.S.-based chips manufacturing a priority as part of his relentless pursuit of an American manufacturing renaissance, and it’s paying off — with trillions of dollars in new investments secured in the tech sector alone,” the White House said. Earlier this year, Trump announced a joint venture investing up to $500 billion for infrastructure tied to artificial intelligence by a new partnership formed by OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank. The new entity, Stargate, was tasked with building out data centers and the electricity generation needed for the further development of the fast-evolving AI in Texas, according to the White House. The initial investment is expected to be $100 billion and could reach five times that sum.","In a statement Monday, the White House called Nvidia’s move “the Trump Effect in action.” Trump “has made U.S.-based chips manufacturing a priority as part of his relentless pursuit of an American manufacturing renaissance, and it’s paying off — with trillions of dollars in new investments secured in the tech sector alone,” the White House said.","In a statement Monday, the White House called Nvidia’s move “the Trump Effect in action.” Trump “has made U.S.-based chips manufacturing a priority as part of his relentless pursuit of an American manufacturing renaissance, and it’s paying off — with trillions of dollars in new investments secured in the tech sector alone,” the White House said.","Mass production at both plants is expected to ramp up in the next 12-15 months, Nvidia said.","Nvidia's AI super computers will serve as the engines for AI factories, “a new type of data center created for the sole purpose of processing artificial intelligence,” the company said, adding that manufacturing in the U.S. will create “hundreds of thousands of jobs and drive trillions of dollars in economic security over the coming decades."""
A fugitive Indian jeweler accused of a $1.8bn bank fraud has been arrested in Belgium,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/a-fugitive-indian-jeweler-accused-of-a-18bn-bank-fraud-has-been-arrested-in-belgium-2025-04-14/,"NEW DELHI (AP) — Fugitive Indian jeweler Mehul Choksi, who has been accused of involvement in one of India’s biggest bank frauds, has been arrested in Belgium, his lawyer said Monday. Choksi and his diamond tycoon nephew Nirav Modi are accused of a $1.8 billion fraud involving Punjab National Bank, the country’s second-largest public lender. Both fled India in 2018. The arrest was made following an extradition request by Indian authorities, local media reported. Choksi was arrested on Saturday in the Belgian port city of Antwerp, one of the most important diamond trading hubs in the world. His lawyer, Vijay Aggarwal, told reporters that Choksi's legal team would file an appeal for his release. Both Choksi and Modi have denied the accusations. Punjab National Bank accused Choksi, Modi and others of fraud by using fake financial documents to get loans to buy and import jewels. Aggarwal said the “obvious” grounds for the appeal would be that Choksi is “not a flight risk, is extremely sick and undergoing treatment for cancer.” He also said they would argue that Choksi's was a “political” case and mount their defense on grounds that Indian prisons have inhumane conditions. Modi, who built an international jewelry empire that stretched from India to New York and Hong Kong, was arrested in Britain in 2019. He has been in prison since.","NEW DELHI (AP) — Fugitive Indian jeweler Mehul Choksi, who has been accused of involvement in one of India’s biggest bank frauds, has been arrested in Belgium, his lawyer said Monday.","Aggarwal said the “obvious” grounds for the appeal would be that Choksi is “not a flight risk, is extremely sick and undergoing treatment for cancer.” He also said they would argue that Choksi's was a “political” case and mount their defense on grounds that Indian prisons have inhumane conditions.","Choksi and his diamond tycoon nephew Nirav Modi are accused of a $1.8 billion fraud involving Punjab National Bank, the country’s second-largest public lender.","Aggarwal said the “obvious” grounds for the appeal would be that Choksi is “not a flight risk, is extremely sick and undergoing treatment for cancer.” He also said they would argue that Choksi's was a “political” case and mount their defense on grounds that Indian prisons have inhumane conditions."

NYSE: MATIV do not have the stability of a Coca-Cola or P&G, and their ability to continue to pay dividends—or to continue to pay them at the same sustained level—is not nearly as secure as those larger firms. However, each of these companies is trading at a relative discount, and each has the support of at least one optimistic Wall Street analyst. As a real estate investment trust (REIT), Global Self Storage must pay investors 90% or more of its taxable income in disbursements. Unlike some REITs, which focus on office or data center properties and are heavily tied to the economy's overall strength, Global's purview is self-storage properties. Given low operating costs and relatively stable demand, the self-storage business could constitute a reasonable defensive play in markets that are not oversaturated with options. Although it has declined by nearly 7% year-to-date (YTD), Global has outperformed the S&P 500 over April 11, 2025. The company has a dividend yield of 5.88% and marginal annualized 3-year dividend growth. With a dividend payout ratio of more than 161%, Global may be at risk of overpaying dividends. This may be one reason why the company recently agreed to an at-market offering of up to $15 million of common stock in partnership with Alliance Global Partners. The firm also beat analyst predictions for EPS in the most recent quarter by a healthy margin of 11 cents per share. With a whopping 8.21% dividend yield, dividend investors are likely to consider office and school supply manufacturer ACCO Brands. But the huge yield comes with a few important caveats. First, ACCO has experienced a declining top line for the last several years, and uncertainties around the potential impact of tariffs further threaten the company's sales. Due to impairment charges, net income has also been negative in multiple recent periods. However, the company has been able to generate substantial free cash flows of at least $100 million per year. ACCO's efforts to cut costs have improved margins and reduced debt load in recent months, further making the stock more attractive to investors. Still, shares are down about 30% YTD as of April 11, although that has given the company a price-to-sales ratio of just 0.2. For investors optimistic that the company will navigate the tariff environment smoothly and turn around sales trends, Barrington Research shares in this optimism and has assigned ACCO a Buy rating and a price target of $7.00 per share, just about double the current price point. Specialty materials manufacturer Mativ Holdings may be our list's highest-risk, highest-reward play. The company's operations leave it potentially exposed to significant tariff risk, and as of April 11, it had experienced a 55% share price decline YTD, compounded by an earnings miss in February. On the other hand, though, Mativ offers the highest dividend yield of these three firms at 8.27%, and analysts at Stifel Nicolaus upgraded the firm from Hold to Buy in March, setting a price target of $10. This is more than double the current price of MATV shares. Investors seeking dividends and willing to take a risk could see big rewards for an investment in Mativ, if that prediction comes to pass.

Meta says it will resume AI training with public content from European users,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/meta-says-it-will-resume-ai-training-with-public-content-from-european-users-2025-04-14/,"LONDON (AP) — Social media company Meta said Monday that it will start using publicly available content from European users to train its artificial intelligence models, resuming work put on hold last year after activists raised concerns about data privacy. The company, which owns Facebook and Instagram, said that it would train its AI systems using public posts and comments shared by adult users in the 27-nation European Union. “People’s interactions with Meta AI — like questions and queries — will also be used to train and improve our models,” the company said in a blog post. Meta is making the move after launching its Meta AI assistant last month for European users, long after it rolled out to the United States and other major markets. The company's AI training efforts had been hampered by stringent European Union data privacy laws, which give people control over how their personal information is used. Vienna-based group NOYB, led by activist Max Schrems, had complained to various national privacy watchdogs about Meta’s AI training plans and urged them to stop the company before it started training its next generation of AI models. Meta noted that a panel of EU privacy regulators in December “affirmed” that its original approach met legal obligations. The company said it won't use private messages to train its AI model and repeated its point that it is merely following the example of rivals Google and OpenAI, “both of which have already used data from European users to train their AI models."" Meta said it will start notifying users in the EU about the training, and will include a link to a form where they can object at any time. “We'll honor all objection forms,” the company said.

Intel sells majority stake in Altera to Silver Lake investors in a deal valued at $8.75 billion,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/intel-sells-majority-stake-in-altera-to-silver-lake-investors-in-a-deal-valued-at-875-billion-2025-04-14/,"Intel announced Monday that it was selling the majority of its Altera chip business to technology investor Silver Lake in a deal valued at $8.75 billion. Silver Lake will own 51% of Altera, which Intel acquired in 2015 for $16.7 billion in an effort to expand its business into chip markets focused on wireless, automobiles and other products. At the time, it was the biggest deal in Intel Corp.'s history. Intel spun Altera off into an independent company earlier this year. Silver Lake's acquisition of Altera is expected to close in the second half of this year. “Today’s announcement reflects our commitment to sharpening our focus, lowering our expense structure and strengthening our balance sheet,” said Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan. ”We look forward to partnering with Silver Lake upon closing of the transaction, as their industry expertise will help to accelerate Altera’s efforts and unlock additional economic value for Intel."" Tan joined Intel as CEO just one month ago. Intel also announced that Raghib Hussain will succeed Sandra Rivera as chief executive officer of Altera, effective in early May. Intel shares were up 3.2% just after the opening bell Monday. The broader technology sector was boosted Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Friday said he was exempting smartphones, computers and some other electronics from some of his stiff tariffs. Trump then spent Sunday downplaying the significance of exemptions that reduce but won’t eliminate the effect of U.S. tariffs on imports of popular consumer devices and their key components.",Intel announced Monday that it was selling the majority of its Altera chip business to technology investor Silver Lake in a deal valued at $8.75 billion.,Intel announced Monday that it was selling the majority of its Altera chip business to technology investor Silver Lake in a deal valued at $8.75 billion.,Intel announced Monday that it was selling the majority of its Altera chip business to technology investor Silver Lake in a deal valued at $8.75 billion.,Intel announced Monday that it was selling the majority of its Altera chip business to technology investor Silver Lake in a deal valued at $8.75 billion.
