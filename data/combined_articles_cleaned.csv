Indian Hotels shares rise after report says Taj may exit New York's Pierre hotel in $2-bn deal,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/indian-hotels-shares-rise-after-report-says-taj-may-exit-new-york-s-pierre-hotel-in-2-bn-deal-13556404.html,"The shares of Indian Hotels Company (IHCL) gained 1 percent on September 18 amid reports saying that the Pierre Hotel in New York, which is managed by the Taj chain, may see a change in ownership. IHCL shares sharply rose 1 percent after trading in the red earlier during the day. Who are the prospective buyers? Prominent Saudi family, the Khashoggis, and the Dorchester Collection, a luxury hotel company owned by the sultanate of Brunei, have reached the final stages of discussions to purchase the iconic luxury hotel in New York for approximately $2 billion, New York Times reported citing sources. The Khashoggis will provide some of the funding, while Dorchester Collection will mostly manage the building after an extensive renovation, the report added. The iconic Pierre in New York was inaugurated in 1930, and was reintroduced in 2007 as the Taj flagship in the USA. The luxury hotel is located in the Central Park. According to the NYT report, billionaire and currently the US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick in 2023 pushed for the plan to hire his own real estate firm Newmark Group for advice on how to revamp the property which was seeing some damage over time. The board, as advised by Newmark, has now reached the final stages of talk to sell Piere for roughly $2 billion, the report added. 'Residents may be forced to move out' If the sale does take place, Pierre's permanent residents like former Disney chief Michael Eisner, fashion designer Tory Burch and Shari Redstone, who recently sold her company Paramount, may be forced to move out, the report added. Lutnick also has a penthouse in the Pierre. After months of discussions, Newmark concluded that Taj was not willing to invest more money to address the growing problems of the building, according to communications by The Times, cited by NYT. Moneycontrol couldn't independently verify the reports. The shares of IHCL have gained nearly 2 percent in the past five days, but have fallen around 10 percent in 2025 so far. The stock gained nearly 16 percent in the past one year.

Cohance Life shares tumble 6% as 3.4 crore shares exchange hands via block deal,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/cohance-life-shares-tumble-6-as-3-4-crore-shares-exchange-hands-via-block-deal-13556246.html,"Shares of Cohance Lifesciences came under sharp pressure on September 18, tumbling 6 percent to Rs 909 apiece after a large block deal hit the exchanges. Around 3.39 crore shares, translating to 8.9 percent equity worth Rs 3,073 crore, changed hands in early trade. While the identity of sellers was not confirmed, reports on CNBC-TV18 suggested that Jusmiral Holdings was looking to offload up to 8.9 percent stake in the company. The reported deal is also accompanied by a 210-day lock-up on further share sales. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog Despite the knee-jerk reaction, global brokerage Jefferies has an optimistic view on Cohance and the broader Indian CRDMO (Contract Research, Development, and Manufacturing Organization) sector. The brokerage recently initiated coverage with a “Buy” rating and a price target of Rs 1,150, citing structural tailwinds. “India’s CRDMO industry is transitioning from being a traditional chemical manufacturer to becoming a strategic partner for global innovators. This shift, driven by enhanced capabilities, geographic diversification, and the China+1 strategy, could deliver a high-teen revenue CAGR over the next decade,” Jefferies said. In Q1FY26, Cohance reported an adjusted net profit of Rs 62.9 crore, down 24.8 percent year-on-year from Rs 83.5 crore in Q1FY25. Revenue from operations, however, rose 12.5 percent YoY to Rs 549.3 crore, supported by growth across segments. Material margin improved 20.1 percent YoY to Rs 401.2 crore, with margin percentage expanding to 73 percent from 68.4 percent, aided by a favourable business mix and contributions from recent acquisitions.

"Infosys, LTIMindtree, Wipro, other IT stocks rise up to 3% after 25 bps Fed rate cut",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/infosys-ltimindtree-wipro-other-it-stocks-rise-up-to-3-after-25-bps-fed-rate-cut-13556193.html,"The shares of Indian IT companies jumped on September 18 after the US Federal Reserve cut its interest rate for the first time since December 2024. The sharp rise in the share prices pushed the Nifty IT index higher to emerge as the top sectoral gainer on the market today. The Nifty IT index rose 1.5 percent in the morning to 37,006, extending gains for the third consecutive session. US Fed cuts rates by 25 bps: The US Federal Reserve on September 17 slashed its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 4-4.25 percent, in line with analyst expectations. Notably, this marked the first rate cut announced by the American central bank since Donald Trump began his second term as the President of the United States. More rate cuts on the way? Policymakers hinted at two more quarter-point cuts this year (50 bps in total), plus one cut in 2026 and another in 2027. One official projected a whopping 125 bps of easing by December. In its statement, the US Fed said ""recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity moderated in the first half of the year. Job gains have slowed, and the unemployment rate has edged up but remains low. Inflation has moved up and remains somewhat elevated."" It added that ""downside risks to employment have risen"", prompting the shift in policy. 'A risk management cut' During the press conference, US Fed Chair Jerome Powell called the quarter-point rate cut a ""risk management cut"", highlighting that the labour market has softened and ""the recent pace of job creation appears to be running below the breakeven rate needed to hold the unemployment rate constant."" He added, ""The labour market is softening and we don’t need it to soften anymore (and) don't want it to."" Why IT stocks surge after Fed's rate cut: A rate cut in the US is expected to increase the discretionary spending limit, which in turn benefits IT companies which derive a significant portion of their revenue from the North American market. LTIMindtree shares jumped nearly 3 percent to trade at Rs 5,573 apiece. Infosys, Wipro and Mphasis shares surged nearly 2 percent each. Persistent Systems, HCL Tech, Coforge and Tech Mahindra shares gained more than 1 percent each. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) shares were up nearly 1 percent. What analysts say? ""The FED continues to face a delicate balancing act following a 0.25% rate cut at its latest meeting in September. Whilst the rate cut was expected, it is of more note to listen to what Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in the Press Conference afterwards, where he mentioned that policy decisions remain challenging, and the committee members are still split on further rate cuts, with 10 out of 19 policy makers seeing two or more rate cuts this year,"" said Ross Maxwell, Global Strategy Lead at VT Markets. ""Financial markets are likely to welcome the rate cut in the near term, as lower borrowing costs ease pressure on households and businesses. Equity markets may see short-term support, though bond yields could remain volatile as investors weigh growth concerns against inflation risks,"" he added.

PM Modi turns 75: Sensex rallied up to 245% under his leadership; what lies ahead?,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sensex-rallied-up-to-245-under-pm-modi-s-leadership-what-lies-ahead-13554288.html,"Indian capital markets have seen strong surge since Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power in 2014. Indian benchmark index Sensex rose up to 60,000 points since then, which implies gains to the tune of nearly 245 percent. Analysts now expect the Indian stock markets to rally further, under PM Modi's leadership. Sensex jumped 245% in 10 years: Prime Minister Narendra Modi took charge on May 26, 2014. Sensex was trading at around 25,000-level then. The benchmark index then rallied more than 60,000 points (around 245 percent) in around 10 years to nearly touch the 86,000-mark in September 2024. The index has now seen some correction, closing at 82,694 on September 17. Several analysts who spoke to Moneycontrol suggest that Sensex can rally sharply to hit the key 1,00,000-mark by the end of PM Modi's third term in 2029. What led to the sharp gains? According to Khushi Mistry, Research Analyst at Bonanza, Sensex and Nifty's massive gains since May 2014 have been driven by reforms-led FDI inflows, robust consumption growth, a banking sector reset, accelerated digital adoption, and strong corporate earnings, alongside global liquidity and a stable policy framework under the Modi government. Sensex hitting 1 lakh by the end of PM Modi’s third term is possible if current earnings growth (14–16% CAGR), government reforms, and capex cycle sustain, she said, adding that risks include global volatility and oil prices. ""Bullish estimates expect Sensex could hit the mark before 2029 if reforms stay on track, but any major shocks could delay this milestone,"" the analyst said. 'Sensex at 1 lakh is a very achievable target' Shravan Shetty, Managing Director at Primus Partners, said hitting 1 lakh mark in the next three years is a very achievable target. “Historically, markets have grown at 12-15% and with markets at 82K, it should reach the target. We believe that the India story is still being played out, and with lower growth expected globally, especially the USA, we should see higher FII participation helping markets grow,"" he said. Santosh Meena, Head of Research at Swastika Investmart, believes it is quite possible for the Sensex to reach the 1,00,000 mark by the end of Prime Minister Modi’s third term, as it is only about 20 percent away from current levels. 'Valuations have become more reasonable now' ""After a year of flat returns, valuations have become more reasonable, creating a comfortable entry point. On the domestic front, growth-supportive factors remain strong, with recent income tax cuts, interest rate reductions, and GST rationalization acting as key catalysts that can drive the next leg of market expansion,"" he added. Morgan Stanley in August had said that it sees Sensex hitting the key 1 lakh mark by June next year in bull case, citing a final trade deal with the US, more capex announcements, acceleration in loans, uniform improvement in high frequency data and improving trade with China as the likely triggers. However, it had also suggested a bear case where Sensex could fall to 70,000 on the back of surging oil prices, slowing growth and more. 'Democratisation of India's capital markets under PM Modi's leadership' Extending wishes to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on his 75th birthday, NSE CEO Ashish Chauhan on September 17 noted how India's capital markets developed under PM Modi’s leadership over the years. ""Under his leadership, India has emerged as the world's fourth-largest economy and the fourth-largest capital market, with the equity market capitalisation of NSE-listed companies rising over 6 times-from about Rs 67 lakh crore in May 2014 to nearly Rs 460 lakh crore today,"" he said. Chauhan said the ""democratisation of capital markets"" reflects the rise of India's middle class, with nearly one in four households now investing in equities, which underscores the growing trust in India's economic future under PM Modi’s leadership.

Click to View More Outlook for September 18 Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets edged higher in a subdued session on Wednesday, reflecting a positive yet cautious undertone. After a firm start, the Nifty index traded in a narrow range throughout the day before settling at 25,330.25 level. Sectoral performance was mixed, with IT, banking, and auto emerging as the top gainers, while metals, FMCG, and pharma witnessed profit-taking. Meanwhile, the broader indices maintained their positive bias, with both midcap and small-cap indices closing in the green. Despite the range-bound move, underlying sentiment remains supported by optimism around policy reforms and robust domestic flows. However, persistent FII selling and caution ahead of the U.S. Fed policy outcome capped the momentum. On the index front, the Nifty is now inching towards the 25,500 mark, aided by renewed strength in banking and rotational buying across sectors. We recommend continuing with a “buy on dips” approach, with support placed around the 25,050–25,150 zone, while keeping position sizes moderate given the likelihood of higher volatility due to global events. Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities Today, the benchmark indices continued their positive momentum.

Among sectors, the PSU Bank Index outperformed, rallying over 2.60 percent, whereas consumer and selective Metal stocks registered intraday profit booking at higher levels. Technically, after a promising opening, the entire day witnessed range-bound activity. However, the short-term market outlook remains positive. We believe that 25,200/82500 and 25,150/82200 are key support zones for trend-following traders. As long as the market trades above these levels, the uptrend is likely to continue. On the higher side, the index could move up to 25,400-25,500/83000-83200.

This comes as analysts increasingly expect trade talks between India and US to resume, amid cooling tensions between the two countries. Gokaldas Exports shares surged nearly 7 percent to trade at nearly Rs 835 apiece. Welspun Living shares also rallied around 7 percent to trade at Rs 132.50 apiece. Pearl Global Industries and Arvind shares jumped around 4 percent each, while Indo Count Industries and K.P.R. Mill shares gained around 2 percent each. Raymond shares were up 1 percent. Cooling India-US trade tensions: Indo-US relations have seen some improvement in recent days with US President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreeing to resume trade talks. Brendan Lynch, a key US trade negotiator arrived in India yesterday to discuss 'trade issues' between Washington and New Delhi. Trump called Prime Minister Modi a ""dear friend"" and talked optimistically about the trade momentum. PM Modi, in turn, reaffirmed India and US as ""close friends and natural partners"" and expressed confidence that current trade talks would unlock significant potential for both nations. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said he had a ""wonderful call"" with PM Modi. ""I wished him a very Happy Birthday! He is doing a tremendous job. Narendra: Thank you for your support on ending the War between Russia and Ukraine! President DJT,"" he wrote. The Indian Prime Minister then thanked him for his birthday wishes. Easing trade tensions to boost export-oriented textile stocks: The cooling trade tensions between India and US provided much needed boost to the stock markets, as investors earlier remained worried over the impact of Trump's 50 percent tariff on India. All these developments reignited hopes for easing trade tensions between the two countries, which would likely benefit the export-oriented textile stocks. Motilal Oswal Financial Services said the markets are likely to be supported by encouraging developments in the ongoing US-India trade negotiations. ""A recent phone conversation between the US President and Indian Prime Minister on Modi’s birthday signals a willingness to ease tensions between the two major economies, further boosting investor sentiment,"" the domestic brokerage said.

SBI shares were trading at around Rs 857.40 apiece, extending gains for the third consecutive session. Yes Bank shares meanwhile were trading in the red with marginal losses at around Rs 20.94 apiece. About SMBC's deal to buy 20% stake in Yes Bank: Earlier in May this year, SMBC agreed to buy 20 percent stake in Yes Bank, marking one of the largest foreign investments in an Indian private bank. Following this deal, SMBC will emerge as the single-largest shareholder in Yes Bank. It was set to buy the largest chunk of over 13 percent stake from SBI (worth nearly Rs 8,889 crore), and the remaining (around 7 percent) from a group of Indian banks including Axis Bank, Bandhan Bank, Federal Bank, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, IDFC First Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank. These banks had originally invested in Yes Bank at around Rs 10 per share during its reconstruction phase in 2020. 'Largest cross-border investment in the Indian banking sector' ""The partial stake sale by SBI and other shareholder Banks in YBL to SMBC represents the largest cross-border investment in the Indian banking sector. The transaction has received the necessary regulatory and statutory approvals including from the Reserve Bank of India and the Competition Commission of India,"" SBI said in its press release. Following the divestment, SBI will continue to hold 10.8 percent stake in Yes Bank. Here's what SBI Chairman said on Yes Bank stake sale: ""Yes Bank restructuring plan by RBI in 2020 was an innovative, first of its kind public sector – private sector partnership that was fully supported and facilitated by Government of India. We are incredibly proud of the journey we have shared with Yes Bank in supporting their transformation since we came onboard as the major shareholder in 2020,"" said SBI Chairman Challa Sreenivasulu Setty. ""This is perhaps the best example of protecting the customer interests of a large bank by collaborative efforts of SBI and other banks under the guidance of Government of India and RBI. We are excited to welcome SMBC, a marquee financial institution, as a strategic partner through the largest cross-border transaction in India’s banking sector. Their global expertise will be a great complement to Yes Bank’s ongoing progress and future ambitions,"" he added.

NSDL – the first depository of the country – is uniquely positioned to benefit from this trend, capturing both the breadth of new retail investors entering the system and the depth of rising custody value from institutional and corporate issuers. NSDL dominates in institutional, custodian, and large corporate accounts, resulting in revenue per active account at ~INR157 in FY25 — nearly 3x that of CDSL. The institutional skew offers more stable revenue pools linked to custody value rather than purely transaction volumes, underpinning resilience across market cycles. NSDL services the widest base of issuers in India, including ~70%+ of unlisted corporates mandated to dematerialize. This not only generates stable, recurring issuer charges but also creates a sticky moat, as issuers rarely migrate once demat systems are embedded. The potential growth for this is large, as the unlisted market in India continues to grow at a healthy pace. Outlook We expect a revenue/EBITDA/PAT CAGR of 5%/14%/15% over FY25-28. Given the duopoly nature of the industry and NSDL’s superior pricing power, depositories deserve premium valuations. However, we believe the stock is fairly valued, and all the positives are priced in at current levels. Hence, we initiate coverage on NSDL with a Neutral rating and a one-year TP of INR1,200 (premised on ~45x FY28E P/E).

The Nifty IT index rose more than 0.8 percent in the morning, extending gains for the second consecutive session and emerging as one of the top sectoral gainers on the market today. Fed rate cut on the way? US Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell is set to announce the outcome of FOMC meeting which is being held from September 16 to September 17. Analysts estimate that the American central bank will cut rates this time — especially amid weak jobs data and rising pressure from President Donald Trump’s administration. Experts who spoke to Moneycontrol held different opinions regarding the quantum of rate cut that Fed chief Jerome Powell may announce today. Some opine that a 25 bps rate cut should be expected, while others hint at a bumper 50 bps cut. Very few, however, hold the view that the American central bank may keep the rates unchanged. A rate cut in the US is expected to increase the discretionary spending limit, which in turn benefits IT companies which derive a significant portion of their revenue from the North American market. Top IT gainers today: Persistent Systems shares were the top gainer on the index, rising more than 2 percent to trade at Rs 5,605 apiece. Mphasis and LTI Mindtree shares gained more than 1 percent each. Coforge, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Infosys shares rose around 0.8 percent each, while Tech Mahindra, HCL Tech and Wipro shares were up around 0.4 percent each. Notably, Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) has increased its stake in Tech Mahindra by a little over 2 percent, raising its holding from 8.836 percent to 10.84 percent, according to reports.

MCX shares rally 5 percent as Sebi chair Tuhin Kanta talks of steps to revive commodity derivatives,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/commodities/mcx-shares-rally-5-percent-as-sebi-chair-tuhin-kanta-talks-of-steps-to-revive-commodity-derivatives-13553252.html,"Shares of leading commodity derivatives exchange MCX are sharply higher by 5 percent tracking comments by market regulator Sebi's chairman Tuhin Kanta Pandey, who during the MCX Metals Summit 2025 said there are plans to set up a working group on agri and non-agri commodities to address the bottlenecks for the segment's volume growth. Sebi is of the view that enhanced institutional participation into the commodities market can bring in liquidity and make it more attractive as a tool for hedging, and regulations will be developed to ensure 'prudent institutional access', said the chairman. A proposal to allow FPIs to trade in non-cash, non-agricultural commodity derivative segment is also under examination. The chairman said the regulator will engage with the government to consider banks, insurers and pension funds to trade in these markets. This is in line with Sebi's plans to revive derivatives trading in agri-commodities, and the development was previously reported by Moneycontrol in July 2025. ""Strengthening India's commodity market is high on Sebi's regulatory and development agenda. We have already constituted a committee to recommend measures for deepening the agri-commodities segment. We will also constitute a working group for developing the non-agri commodities segment, including metals,"" said Tuhin Kanta Pandey. Citing ongoing supply chain disruption and tariff wars, Sebi chairman said a robust derivatives market provides a ""powerful shield allowing Indian producers and consumers to hedge against global price shocks."" This need is even more pronounced in the context of critical minerals, he added. ""Our approach will be multi-pronged. First, we will continue to strengthen the integrity and safety of the market. Measures like real-time margin collection and continued monitoring are non-negotiable. Second, we will foster market development and innovation. This means encouraging our exchanges to constantly evolve. Third, we aim to deepen and widen participation. Our markets are for large corporations, traders, importers and SMEs. They are also available for institutional investors such as mutual funds and AIFs who are increasingly recognising metals as an asset class that improves risk-adjusted returns for investors,"" Sebi chairman said.","Shares of leading commodity derivatives exchange MCX are sharply higher by 5 percent tracking comments by market regulator Sebi's chairman Tuhin Kanta Pandey, who during the MCX Metals Summit 2025 said there are plans to set up a working group on agri and non-agri commodities to address the bottlenecks for the segment's volume growth.","Shares of leading commodity derivatives exchange MCX are sharply higher by 5 percent tracking comments by market regulator Sebi's chairman Tuhin Kanta Pandey, who during the MCX Metals Summit 2025 said there are plans to set up a working group on agri and non-agri commodities to address the bottlenecks for the segment's volume growth.","We will also constitute a working group for developing the non-agri commodities segment, including metals,"" said Tuhin Kanta Pandey.","Shares of leading commodity derivatives exchange MCX are sharply higher by 5 percent tracking comments by market regulator Sebi's chairman Tuhin Kanta Pandey, who during the MCX Metals Summit 2025 said there are plans to set up a working group on agri and non-agri commodities to address the bottlenecks for the segment's volume growth."

A news report by Informist Media quoted Puneet Das telling reporters in Kolkata that the company will aim to reclaim volume leadership in the segment, which was ceded to Hindustan Unilever in 2017-18. Das added that the difference between TCPL and HUL's sales is less than a percent in terms of volume, and around 4-5 percent in value terms. Tatas are targetting a 6-8 percent total value growth in the tea segment for the fiscal, according to the June quarter earnings call. TCPL recently launched premium offerings in the tea category, including a green tea with L-Carnitine, an amino acid that helps burn fat, as well as brought in Sachin Tendulkar to endorse Organic India, a brand that the Tatas acquired in 2024. Aside of new launches and deeper distribution network, Tata Global said it aims to expand into towns with populations between 50,000 and 100,000 to increase market reach. Going forward, the management believes if the tea prices fall it may result in lower cost for consumers, but TCPL said it is confident of holding on to profit margins of 30 percent range by Q3FY26. ""If the tea prices come off rapidly, the locals will have access to lower tea prices. And therefore, as we see market prices moving, we will -- like I said, 34% to 36%, 37%, is a margin which we are comfortable with. I don't think this category, you can go beyond this and therefore, as -- if prices come down more dramatically, we will have to give up something in terms of consumer price as well. But overall, I would say, by Q3, you should see margins operating in this range. On a YTD basis, Tata Consumer shares are higher by 22 percent, and down 8 percent over last one year.","FMCG major Tata Consumer Products (TCPL) has plans to pursue premiumization of its tea portfolio to drive growth and unlock value for shareholders, spurring the shares higher by nearly 3 percent in early trade on September 17, with volumes higher than the one-month average of 10 lakh shares.","FMCG major Tata Consumer Products (TCPL) has plans to pursue premiumization of its tea portfolio to drive growth and unlock value for shareholders, spurring the shares higher by nearly 3 percent in early trade on September 17, with volumes higher than the one-month average of 10 lakh shares.","FMCG major Tata Consumer Products (TCPL) has plans to pursue premiumization of its tea portfolio to drive growth and unlock value for shareholders, spurring the shares higher by nearly 3 percent in early trade on September 17, with volumes higher than the one-month average of 10 lakh shares.","FMCG major Tata Consumer Products (TCPL) has plans to pursue premiumization of its tea portfolio to drive growth and unlock value for shareholders, spurring the shares higher by nearly 3 percent in early trade on September 17, with volumes higher than the one-month average of 10 lakh shares."
"Sensex up 313 pts, Nifty above 25,330: Optimism over US trade talks among key factors behind market rise",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sensex-up-300-pts-nifty-above-25-300-optimism-over-us-trade-talks-among-key-factors-behind-market-rise-13552775.html,"Indian benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty extended gains on September 17 on the back of multiple positive factors. Sensex gained around 313 points (nearly 0.4 percent) to close at 82,693.71. Nifty 50, meanwhile, rose 91 points (0.36 percent) to end the session at 25,330.25. PSU Bank stocks led gains, with IT, realty, auto and media stocks were also among the top gainers. FMCG, metal and pharma stocks, however, were trading in the red. Here are the possible key factors pushing the markets into the green: Cooling India-US trade tensions: Indo-US relations have seen some improvement in recent days with US President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreeing to resume trade talks. Brendan Lynch, a key US trade negotiator arrived in India yesterday to discuss 'trade issues' between Washington and New Delhi. Trump called Prime Minister Modi a ""dear friend"" and talked optimistically about the trade momentum. PM Modi, in turn, reaffirmed India and US as ""close friends and natural partners"" and expressed confidence that current trade talks would unlock significant potential for both nations. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said he had a ""wonderful call"" with PM Modi. ""I wished him a very Happy Birthday! He is doing a tremendous job. Narendra: Thank you for your support on ending the War between Russia and Ukraine! President DJT,"" he wrote. The Indian Prime Minister then thanked him for his birthday wishes. The cooling trade tensions between India and US provided much needed boost to the stock markets, as investors earlier remained worried over the impact of Trump's 50 percent tariff on India. Motilal Oswal Financial Services said the markets are likely to be supported by encouraging developments in the ongoing US-India trade negotiations. ""A recent phone conversation between the US President and Indian Prime Minister on Modi’s birthday signals a willingness to ease tensions between the two major economies, further boosting investor sentiment,"" the domestic brokerage said. Likelihood of Fed rate cut: The US Federal Reserve is holding its FOMC meeting from September 16 to September 17. The American central bank's chief Jerome Powell is set to announce the outcome of the meet later today. Analysts estimate that the Fed will cut rates this time — especially amid weak jobs data and rising pressure from President Donald Trump's administration. Rate cut decision by the US Federal Reserve impact the Indian stock market, as it weighs or boosts several rate sensitive stocks. For example, a rate cut in the US is expected to increase the discretionary spending limit, which in turn benefits IT companies which derive a significant portion of their revenue from the North American market. Also, investors expect a rate cut in the US to pave the way for a rate cut in India. The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is set to meet between September 29 and October 1. Any rate cut announcement by the RBI directly impacts the market. Weak US dollar: Rupee recorded its best start in three weeks, opening below the 88-mark on September 17. The currency opened at 87.82 against the dollar after closing the previous session at 88.05. This comes as dollar index remained week as investors awaited Fed’s FOMC meet outcome. ""Expectations of a 25 basis point rate cut by the US Federal Reserve in today's FOMC meeting, coupled with the US Dollar Index dropping to a 3.5-year low below the 96 mark, are likely to support market optimism,"" said Motilal Oswal Financial Services. ""The ongoing rally in the market is being driven by a combination of positive sentiments and fundamentals. The market expects the renewed India-U S trade talks to result in an agreement, culminating in the withdrawal of the 25% penal tariffs imposed on India. If expectations translate into reality, that would be a huge sentiment positive,"" said VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments. ""Fundamentally, the GST reform is expected to trigger an impressive demand spurt led by automobiles. Auto stocks have already rallied, discounting the expectations. White goods, particularly air conditioners, can be beneficiaries. NBFCs financing the purchase of white goods, too, have rallied. Some leading private sector banks like HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank are yet to participate in the rally. These stocks are fairly valued. The Fed is expected to cut rates by 25 bps tonight. More than the rate action the Fed commentary on the evolving economic outlook and the trajectory of future rate action will be closely watched by the market,"" he added.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Bandhan Bank, Ashok Leyland, KEI Industries, Amber Enterprises, Aadhar Housing, Phoenix Mills, and others on September 17?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-bandhan-bank-ashok-leyland-kei-industries-amber-enterprises-aadhar-housing-phoenix-mills-and-others-on-september-17-13551843.html,"Equity benchmark indices rebounded smartly, with the Nifty 50 gaining 0.7 percent on September 16 after minor profit booking in the previous session, supported by healthy market breadth. About 1,779 shares gained against 999 declining shares on the NSE. The market is expected to maintain bullish momentum after surpassing the August swing high. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Amol Athawale, VP-Technical Research at Kotak Securities Tech Mahindra | CMP: Rs 1,531.5 After its declining trend, Tech Mahindra is in the accumulation zone, where it is trading in a range-bound mode on the daily scale. However, recent bullish activity in the stock is indicating good strength. The stock is expected to break out of the range and witness bullish momentum from the current levels, with a favourable risk-reward perspective. For the next few trading sessions, Rs 1,475 could be the trend-decider level for the bulls. If it sustains above this level, we can expect a further uptrend towards Rs 1,630. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,630 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,475 Bandhan Bank | CMP: Rs 162.67 Post its short-term price correction, Bandhan Bank is available near its multiple support zone. The incremental volume activity near this support zone indicates that the downside is restricted. Therefore, the stock is expected to rebound and witness bullish momentum from the current levels. For positional traders, Rs 157 would be the decisive level. Trading above this level, the uptrend formation will continue till Rs 175. However, if it closes below Rs 157, traders may prefer to exit from trading long positions. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 175 Stop-Loss: Rs 157 Ashok Leyland | CMP: Rs 134.54 After the remarkable up move, Ashok Leyland has taken a breather over the last few sessions. The consolidation structure suggests a bullish continuation chart formation. Moreover, the stock comfortably closed above its short-term moving average. Therefore, the stock is likely to resume its uptrend from the current levels in the coming days. As long as the stock is trading above Rs 129, the bullish texture is likely to continue. Above this, the stock could move up to Rs 145. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 145 Stop-Loss: Rs 129 Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors KEI Industries | CMP: Rs 4,179.7 KEI Industries is one of the top performers in its sector over the past week. In the previous session, prices closed above the prior swing high of Rs 4,143 and were up by more than 2% during the day. At the start of September 2025, prices found support at the 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA), and we have seen a rally of more than 9%. As long as the price protects the EMA support of Rs 3,900, the overall bias is likely to remain positive. Additionally, for the past 5 trading sessions, prices have been protecting the prior day’s low on a closing basis, which is acting as a double confirmation. One can use dips towards Rs 4,100–4,130 levels as a buying opportunity, which could take prices higher towards Rs 4,280, followed by Rs 4,390. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 4,280, Rs 4,390 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,900 Amber Enterprises India | CMP: Rs 8,298 Amber Enterprises made a fresh record high near Rs 8,324 and outperformed its sector in the previous session. The stock has continued to inch higher in a higher high and higher low fashion. In the previous session, the stock gave a breakout of a larger Ascending Triangle pattern on the daily chart, which is a strong positive sign. However, for confirmation, follow-up buying is required. On the daily chart, for the past 6 sessions, every candle has closed in green, highlighting its strength. Also, the KST (Know Sure Thing) indicator has turned above the signal line and is also trading above the zero line, suggesting that good momentum is expected to continue. For now, a break above Rs 8,325 is required for bullish momentum to continue towards Rs 8,660, followed by Rs 8,900. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 8,660, Rs 8,900 Stop-Loss: Rs 7,990 Aadhar Housing Finance | CMP: Rs 537.8 On the daily chart, since July 2025, Aadhar Housing Finance was in a sideways trend, consolidating in a range of Rs 490–530. Bullish momentum in the previous session helped the stock give a breakout of this rectangular pattern, and prices also managed to close above it. Currently, Bollinger Bands have started to expand, with a spike in volumes, suggesting that volatility is likely to increase in the coming sessions. Along with this, the MACD has just given a bullish crossover, further supporting the overall stance. A break above Rs 545 can push prices higher towards Rs 570, followed by Rs 590. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 570, Rs 590 Stop-Loss: Rs 520 Vinay Rajani, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities Phoenix Mills | CMP: Rs 1,616 Phoenix Mills has broken out from a downward sloping trendline on the weekly chart. The price breakout is accompanied by a jump in volumes. The stock is placed above all key moving averages, indicating an uptrend across all timeframes. The daily RSI is sustaining above 50, indicating a sustained uptrend for the stock. The daily MACD is placed above its signal line. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,775 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,510 Mirae Asset Nifty MidSmallcap400 Momentum Quality 100 ETF | CMP: Rs 49.41 ETF has recently surpassed the 50 and 200 DEMA resistance. The price breakout is accompanied by a jump in volumes. The daily RSI is sustaining above 50, indicating a sustained uptrend. The daily MACD is placed above both its equilibrium and signal line.

Dr Reddy’s launches novel acid blocker Tegoprazan in India to tap $1 billion market,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/dr-reddy-s-launches-novel-acid-blocker-tegoprazan-in-india-to-tap-1-billion-market-13551538.html,"Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd. on Tuesday announced the launch of a novel gastrointestinal therapy in India, betting on a next-generation acid blocker to strengthen its branded portfolio in a market where nearly four in 10 people suffer from acid-related disorders. The Hyderabad-based drugmaker launched Tegoprazan, a potassium-competitive acid blocker (PCAB), under the brand name PCAB, according to a company statement Tuesday. The drug is indicated for conditions such as erosive and non-erosive gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and gastric ulcers, offering faster onset and longer pH control than conventional treatments, the company said. The rollout follows Dr. Reddy’s exclusive licensing deal with South Korea’s HK inno.N Corp. in 2022 to commercialize Tegoprazan in India and select emerging markets. The molecule is already approved in 21 countries, including South Korea and China, and has completed Phase III trials in the U.S. “We are happy to launch Tegoprazan in India, reinforcing our commitment to innovation in gastrointestinal disease treatment — a key focus area for us,” said M.V. Ramana, chief executive officer for branded markets at Dr. Reddy’s. “Our partnership with HK inno.N brings together complementary strengths to enhance patient access to an innovative molecule that addresses critical gaps in acid peptic disease management,” he added. Acid peptic disorders affect about 38% of India’s population, underscoring the commercial potential for new therapies. In a multinational clinical trial conducted by Dr. Reddy’s across India, South Africa and Russia, 99% of GERD patients on Tegoprazan achieved endoscopic healing by Week 8, the company said. HK inno.N CEO Dal-Won Kwak said the launch marks a milestone for the PCAB class in India. “We hope Tegoprazan will establish itself as a leading innovative therapy and contribute meaningfully to the improvement of gastrointestinal care,” he said. The introduction of Tegoprazan adds to Dr. Reddy’s established gastrointestinal portfolio, which includes brands such as Omez, Razo and Vono. Dr Reddy's has been expanding its branded generics and specialty offerings in India and emerging markets to offset pricing pressure in the US generics segment.","Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd. on Tuesday announced the launch of a novel gastrointestinal therapy in India, betting on a next-generation acid blocker to strengthen its branded portfolio in a market where nearly four in 10 people suffer from acid-related disorders.","Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd. on Tuesday announced the launch of a novel gastrointestinal therapy in India, betting on a next-generation acid blocker to strengthen its branded portfolio in a market where nearly four in 10 people suffer from acid-related disorders.","“We hope Tegoprazan will establish itself as a leading innovative therapy and contribute meaningfully to the improvement of gastrointestinal care,” he said.","The molecule is already approved in 21 countries, including South Korea and China, and has completed Phase III trials in the U.S. “We are happy to launch Tegoprazan in India, reinforcing our commitment to innovation in gastrointestinal disease treatment — a key focus area for us,” said M.V."

"Auto stocks rise up to 3% on GST 2.0, festive demand hopes: Here's what brokerages say",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/auto-stocks-rise-up-to-3-on-gst-reforms-festive-demand-hopes-here-s-what-brokerages-say-13550134.html,"The shares of auto companies gained on September 16, after recording losses in four out of the past five sessions. Brokerages remain bullish over the sector's outlook, suggesting strong upside potential for the stocks. The Nifty Auto index rose 0.84 percent to 26,986.75, according to data on NSE at 1.10 pm. This comes amid easing trade tensions between India and US, optimism over India-European Union trade deal and expectations of rising festive demand following GST reforms boosted investor sentiment. GST reforms: Centre recently announced strong cuts to the GST structure, which will take effect later this month. Analysts estimate that the GST rate cuts will strongly spur demand around Navratri, and benefit the automakers. Maruti Suzuki has seen a 15 percent increase in customer inquiries since the GST rate cut announcement, the automaker's Head of Sales and Marketing Partho Banerjee recently told CNBC-TV18. ""Overall bookings now stand at 1.5 lakh, with 10,000 new bookings coming in daily,"" he added. Cooling India-US trade tensions: Indo-US relations have seen some improvement in recent days with Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreeing to resume trade talks. Trump called Prime Minister Modi a ""dear friend"" and talked optimistically about the trade momentum. PM Modi, in turn, reaffirmed India and US as ""close friends and natural partners"" and expressed confidence that current trade talks would unlock significant potential for both nations. Brendan Lynch, a key US trade negotiator arrived today in India to discuss 'trade issues' between Washington and New Delhi. Special Secretary Rajesh Agarwal however clarified that Lynch's one-day visit is not the sixth round of trade negotiations between India and US, but only a meeting to 'discuss' trade issues. The cooling trade tensions between India and US, and increasing hopes of the two countries resuming trade talks may have boosted auto and auto ancillary stocks. India-EU trade deal: India and EU held their 13th round of talks for the proposed trade deal from September 8-12. The next round of talks will be held in Brussels from October 6-10 as both sides aim to conclude negotiations at the earliest. This too may act as a strong boost for the auto and auto ancillary stocks. MRF shares were the top gainers on the index, jumping nearly 3 percent to trade at Rs 1,51,780 apiece. Balkrishna Industries and Bharat Forge shares followed, rising around 2 percent each. Samvardhana Motherson, Bosch, Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M), Eicher Motors and Maruti Suzuki shares gained more than 1 percent each, while TVS Motor, Tube Investments of India and Hero MotoCorp shares were up around 1 percent each. Ashok Leyland, Bajaj Auto and Exide Industries shares were trading in the green with marginal gains. Bucking the trend, Tata Motors shares were trading in the red with marginal losses. HSBC on auto sector: HSBC in its latest report said that GST-driven price cuts announced by the automakers will boost their CAGR by 200-300 basis points over the next four-five years. The international brokerage noted that the auto stocks have jumped 6-17 percent since the centre's GST revision announcement in August. It added that this will likely track earnings growth. Growth could be front-loaded, HSBC said while raising FY27-28 EPS estimates across companies by 4–14 percent. Here are the latest rating and target prices set by the international brokerage:Maruti Suzuki – Buy call, Target price at Rs 17,000 per shareHyundai Motor India – Buy call, Target price at Rs 2,800 per shareTVS Motor – Buy call, Target price at Rs 4,000 per shareM&M – Buy call, Target price at Rs 4,000 per shareAther Energy – Buy call, Target price at Rs 600 per shareInCred on autos: InCred sees GST rate cuts and cess withdrawal as biggest stimulus for auto sector in recent history. It said that these could trigger a two-three year cyclical recovery. The domestic brokerage raised domestic auto volume forecasts by 300 bps to 11 percent for FY26, and by 500 bps to 15 percent for FY27, led by passenger vehicles. InCred has upgraded its ratings on Apollo Tyres, Escorts Kubota, M&M and Tata Motors. Nomura on autos: Nomura said the GST cuts are leading to early signs of demand recovery. It prefers M&M, Hyundai, TVS Motor and Ashok Leyland among the stocks. The cuts have translated into immediate benefits for buyers and firms are reporting stronger enquiries, surge in bookings and an improved outlook for festive demand, the brokerage said.

Market participants seek protocol after September’s last-minute holiday change shook the settlement system,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/market-participants-seek-protocol-after-september-s-last-minute-holiday-change-shook-the-settlement-system-13550137.html,"Earlier this month, stock exchanges had received an official communication about a holiday on Monday, September 8, which was previously scheduled on Friday, and while it looked like a routine adjustment, at the back end, this led to big chaos. Sebi’s settlement, which operates on T+1, had to move to T+2 for cash and T+3 for derivatives on short notice. From Sebi to brokers, custodians, foreign portfolio investors, mutual funds, and clearing corporations, everyone has a story to share about how this last-moment tweak forced them to burn the midnight oil to resolve the settlement issues. Thankfully, the settlement was completed without any major issue, but it created chaos at the back end. What Exactly Happened? Once the Maharashtra government announced the change in holiday which was scheduled on September 5, banking regulator RBI changed the bank’s holiday to Monday, September 8, as it had to follow states’ holiday calendar as per the Negotiable Instruments Act. RBI communicated the change in holiday to banks and other entities, and when banks are on holiday, fund settlements can’t happen, leaving investors to wait for their funds. How Did the Tweak Impacted the Market? The stock exchanges and clearing corporations make the settlement calendars a year in advance, based on the dates of holidays, and any changes midway can disrupt the whole cycle. How Did FPIs get Impacted? Foreign Portfolio Investors book their foreign exchange based on a TOMO basis - in simple terms, based on tomorrow’s expected price. In this instance, the forex was booked for Monday, and Friday was a holiday as per the earlier plan. In this case, the calculation and fund arrangement went for a toss. Given that the FPIs trade in huge quantities, any change in forex price can impact the cost of trading. How Did Investors get Impacted? Investors were impacted as the funds expected to be credited into their accounts got delayed, leading to to additional margin requirement as previous margins had got blocked. The BTST or Buy Today Sell Tomorrow trade also got impacted as traders could not get the sale money the next day. The settlement for the derivative segment of three trade days - September 4 (Thursday), September 5 (Friday), and September 8 (Monday) - was undertaken on September 9 (Tuesday). Similarly, the settlement for the cash and SLBM segment for September 8 (Monday) and September 9 (Tuesday) was undertaken on September 10 (Wednesday). Exchanges and clearing corporations had to break the settlement part into two days, otherwise the settlement system would have crashed because of the sheer size of trading volume. Stock exchanges, clearing corporations, custodians, and the regulator had to literally burn the midnight oil to ensure smooth settlement. Custodians Worked till 4 AM As per industry sources, custodians and fund accounting teams had to work till early morning to prepare the files for settlement. Not only this, one industry insider said they also had to face FPI queries on how there could be a sudden change in holidays. Some FPIs even mocked the ‘one nation, multiple regulations’ approach, as they could not understand the nuances of local rules. Corporate Action Trigger Market participants concur that a big chaos was averted as there were no major corporate actions except a few dividend issues. If a bonus announcement or some other issue had been effective from Monday, it could have become an issue, as investors who were eligible may have lost the opportunity because of settlement issues. For example, if one had bought shares on Friday on a cum basis and expected to get them on Monday as Friday was a settlement holiday, but the settlement moved to Tuesday. In such a case, they may have lost significantly as they would have received shares on an ex basis – without the bonus shares and prices adjusted accordingly. In such situations, companies cannot be suddenly asked to change their record dates. Incidentally, exchanges were working on both days, Friday and Monday. Sebi and exchanges also issued an alert to investors about the impact on corporate action ex-date and cum-date. MF Debt Schemes Impacted Market participants said debt fund transactions too were impacted due to the sudden change in holiday schedule. As payments are not processed on holidays but the next business day, unit prices change, and investors get the NAV of the next business day. How to Avoid Chaos Next Time? In a situation like this, market participants said the regulators should have a formal way of communication and assess if the regulated entities get impacted because of the tweaks. It will help the market handle things smoothly. They also said that once the trading day starts, the date of settlement should not change. Some participants also say when 24x7 systems like NEFT, RTGS, and UPI are there, then do we really need a settlement calendar?","For example, if one had bought shares on Friday on a cum basis and expected to get them on Monday as Friday was a settlement holiday, but the settlement moved to Tuesday.","Earlier this month, stock exchanges had received an official communication about a holiday on Monday, September 8, which was previously scheduled on Friday, and while it looked like a routine adjustment, at the back end, this led to big chaos.","Not only this, one industry insider said they also had to face FPI queries on how there could be a sudden change in holidays.","Once the Maharashtra government announced the change in holiday which was scheduled on September 5, banking regulator RBI changed the bank’s holiday to Monday, September 8, as it had to follow states’ holiday calendar as per the Negotiable Instruments Act."

India revokes Novartis' patent for blockbuster heart drug,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/india-revokes-novartis-patent-for-blockbuster-heart-drug-13550194.html,"Indian Patent Office (IPO) has revoked Novartis AG’s patent on its blockbuster heart-failure drug Entresto, sold as Vymada in India, saying the Swiss drug company’s claims lacked novelty. Vymada is widely prescribed for hypertension and heart failure. For Novartis, the drug is a major revenue driver, generating $7.8 billion in global sales last year. The September 12 decision by the deputy controller of patents and designs could pave the way for affordable generics. While cancelling the patent for the “supramolecular complex” of sacubitril and valsartan, the active ingredients in Vymada, D Usha Rao said Novartis failed to show any clear therapeutic advantage of its claimed “supramolecular complex” over existing formulations. The order followed a post-grant opposition filed by the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA), an industry group representing major domestic drugmakers. Two companies — IPCA and Micro Labs — also opposed the patent at the post‑grant stage. “The patentee has failed to disclose any demonstrated advantages or technical advancement of the claimed supramolecular complex over the combination already disclosed…,” the controller wrote in the order. Moneycontrol has reviewed a copy of the order. “No experimental data, comparative studies, or technical rationale have been provided to substantiate any enhanced efficacy. Further, no improved therapeutic efficacy has been shown,” Rao said. The patent fell foul of multiple provisions of the Patents Act. The ruling caps nearly two years of litigation that began in December 2023 when IPA challenged the patent on grounds of lack of novelty, prior claiming, obviousness, and insufficiency of disclosure. The opposing parties twice recommended revocation and after a Delhi High Court-directed round of rebuttal evidence, the controller held a final hearing on August 20. Novartis’s representatives abstained from the proceedings, the order said. On February 13, 2009, Novartis was granted a patent for a drug combining valsartan and sacubitril. That patent expired on January 16, 2023, paving the way for dozens of copycats. Novartis then claimed that a particular crystalline form, for which it was granted patent, was essential to Entresto's function, and blocked generic drugmakers from copying its crystalline form. Indian firms opposed the patent, questioning whether the crystalline form offered a therapeutic advantage over earlier ones.. The controller sided with the opponents, who argued that the patent was an attempt at “evergreening” — extending monopoly rights without meaningful innovation — a practice India’s patent law seeks to curb. Novartis spokesperson declined to comment. The drugmaker can appeal the decision in the Delhi High Court.","On February 13, 2009, Novartis was granted a patent for a drug combining valsartan and sacubitril.","While cancelling the patent for the “supramolecular complex” of sacubitril and valsartan, the active ingredients in Vymada, D Usha Rao said Novartis failed to show any clear therapeutic advantage of its claimed “supramolecular complex” over existing formulations.","For Novartis, the drug is a major revenue driver, generating $7.8 billion in global sales last year.","“The patentee has failed to disclose any demonstrated advantages or technical advancement of the claimed supramolecular complex over the combination already disclosed…,” the controller wrote in the order."

The sentiment in select stocks was positive after Bloomberg News reported citing people familiar with the development that the Centre also has plans to rollout incentives worth Rs 4,000 crore to support the shipbreaking industry, likely by end of September. The incentives would be for the longer term and may also involve credit notes to ship owners bringing old vessels to Indian shores, the report said. Incentive for Shipbreaking This scheme for a shipbreaking credit note was announced in the Union budget and incentivises ship scrapping by issuing credit note for 40 percent of the scrap value, which can be reimbursed to buy new Made in India ships. Moneycontrol is yet to independently confirm the quantum of the incentive, though in the past, it has been reported that the Centre has ambitious plans to incentivize India's domestic shipping industry through various incentive schemes and sops. In this union budget, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had proposed to set up a Maritime Development Fund (MDF) for financial assistance, via equity or debt securities. With an initial corpus of Rs 25,000 crore, MDF will have government's contribution at 49 percent while the rest will be from port authorities, PSUs, financial institutions as well as the private sector. ""While the Shipbuilding Financial Assistance Policy (SBFAP) is designed to provide financial incentives to Indian shipyards, the Ship-breaking Credit Note further strengthens the domestic industry by encouraging investment and expansion. These measures are expected to drive capital inflows, create employment opportunities, and enhance sectoral competitiveness,"" Shipping Minister Sarbananda Sonowal had said after the budget announcement. Eye on Global Shipbuilding Market The Shipping Ministry has plans to develop new shipbuilding clusters of 1-1.2 million Gross Tonnage (GT) each. Sarbananda Sonowal had said earlier this year that public-private partnerships and international collaborations will be crucial to this ambition. ""This strategic push is crucial in realising India’s vision of becoming a $30 trillion economy by 2047. By leveraging the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model, the scheme is designed to attract private investment, promote modernisation, and advance green technologies,"" Sonowal had said. On September 15, MoS for Ports and Shipping, Shantanu Thakur had told a CII conference that India plans to add 10 world-class shipyards in the next five years. The government plans to develop ""10 world-class shipyards by 2030, supported by public-private partnerships and international collaborations that will bring global best practices to Indian shores,"" Shantanu Thakur had said.

Brendan Lynch, a trade negotiator with the Office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) will be arriving today in India to discuss 'trade issues' between Washington and New Delhi. Special Secretary Rajesh Agarwal however clarified that Lynch's one-day visit is not the sixth round of trade negotiations between India and US, but only a meeting to 'discuss' trade issues. India-US trade relations: The two nations had opened negotiations for a Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) in March this year, and have conducted five rounds of talks so far, with the last one being held in July in the US. However, following US President Donald Trump's decision to double tariffs on India to a whopping 50 percent, the next round of trade talks slated for August 25-29 in New Delhi was deferred. Cooling trade jitters: Indo-US relations have seen some improvement in recent days with Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreeing to resume trade talks. Trump called Prime Minister Modi a ""dear friend"" and talked optimistically about the trade momentum. PM Modi, in turn, reaffirmed India and US as ""close friends and natural partners"" and expressed confidence that current trade talks would unlock significant potential for both nations.India and the US are close friends and natural partners. I am confident that our trade negotiations will pave the way for unlocking the limitless potential of the India-US partnership. Our teams are working to conclude these discussions at the earliest.

In a post on Truth Social, Trump had said, ""I am pleased to announce that India, and the United States of America, are continuing negotiations to address the Trade Barriers between our two Nations."" Textile stocks surge: All these developments reignited hopes for easing trade tensions between the two countries, which would likely benefit the export-oriented textile stocks. Indo Count Industries shares rallied around 10 percent to trade at Rs 307.79 apiece. KPR Mill shares surged 7 percent to trade at Rs 1,121.80 apiece, while Pearl Global Industries shares jumped nearly 6 percent. Raymond Lifestyle shares jumped nearly 4 percent.

"Trump's tariffs bite off Rs 25,000 crore from shrimp exporters' profit, Andhra CM Chandrababu Naidu seeks Centre's help",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/trump-s-tariffs-bite-off-rs-25-000-crore-from-shrimp-exporters-profit-andhra-cm-chandrababu-naidu-seeks-centre-s-help-13549463.html,"Trump's tariffs may have caused a loss of Rs 25,000 crore to India's shrimp exporters, with up to half of the export orders facing cancellations, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu has said. Chandrababu Naidu pegged the estimate in a letter to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal and Fisheries Minister Rajiv Ranjan Singh, requesting government support for Andhra's aquaculture sector. “The taxes imposed by America majorly hit shrimp exports. It is estimated that a loss of Rs 25,000 crore would have occurred. Up to 50 percent export orders have been cancelled,” Chandrababu Naidu said in the letter. Andhra Pradesh makes up 80 percent of India's shrimp exports, worth over Rs 21,000 crore every year. During FY24, India exported record volume of seafood worth $7.38 billion, with USA and China being the major importers and frozen shrimp the largest export item, according to data from Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA). During FY25, India shipped seafood worth Rs 62,408 crore ($7.45 billion). Naidu has called for a Rs 100 crore corpus fund, cold storages, and seafood markets, adding that the state is ready to set up a shrimp producers' committee to ensure farm-to-market supply chains. The state government has also initiated support measures by getting aquaculture feed prices lowered by Rs 9 per kg and is considering subsidised power transformers for the farms. CM Naidu has also sought a one-time top-up loan of Rs 1 lakh under Kisan Credit Card scheme for the farmers. This comes as the European Union approved 102 additional seafood processing and export units from India just days ago, a move that will boost seafood exports and position the nation as a trusted supplier. ""This milestone will enable us to scale our EU trade, empower our farmer partners, and reaffirm India’s leadership in sustainable aquaculture and seafood exports,"" Chairman and Managing Director of Kings Infra, Shaji Baby John said on September 10. EU-bound exports from India had reached Rs 9,430 crore ($1.12 billion) last fiscal, led by frozen shrimps among the leading items. India is also in discussions with the EU for a wider FTA, with the next round of discussions scheduled on October 6-10. The EU is the third largest export destination for Indian shrimps, with US and China being the top two markets, in terms of turnover. In terms of quantity, China has emerged as the largest seafood export destination from India. CareEdge Ratings in a recent note had warned that if the current tariff levels persist, the hit on exports may be more pronounced next fiscal, and volumes may drop by up to 15 percent. India, along with Ecuador, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, and China are the largest players in the global shrimp export market with a combined market share of around 75% in value terms and 74% in volume terms. Despite the export levy, shares of Avanti Feeds and Kings Infra are higher by 10 percent and 5 percent respectively over the last one month, while shares of Waterbase are flat for the period.

Godfrey Phillips shares surge 9% after turning ex-bonus: Here's why you should ignore the 66% plunge,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/godfrey-phillips-shares-surge-9-after-turning-ex-bonus-here-s-why-you-should-ignore-the-66-plunge-13549379.html,"The shares of Godfrey Phillips appeared to have crashed around 66 percent in one single session on September 16, as the stock price adjusted to a bonus issue of shares. The stock in reality jumped more than 9 percent after turning ex-bonus. Godfrey Phillips' board of directors during a meeting in August had approved the issue of bonus shares in the ratio of 2:1. The record date to determine the eligibility of the shareholders set to receive the bonus equity shares was set on September 16. What is a bonus issue? A company announces bonus issue of shares to reward its existing shareholders with an investment opportunity, which is perceived to be attractive. While the issue of bonus shares increases the total number of shares issued and owned, it does not change the market capitalization of the company. This increases the overall liquidity of the stock, and makes it more affordable for other investors to add to their portfolio, creating strong upside potential for the stock. Godfrey Phillips share price: Key details As a result, Godfrey Phillips’ shares appeared to have crashed 66 percent in one session, while in reality, they simply adjusted to the bonus issue. The stock jumped more than 9 percent to hit an intraday high of Rs 3,720 apiece. After the issuance of bonus shares, the company's market capitalization stands at around Rs 57,401 crore and the stock's P/E ratio nears 161. The issuance of bonus shares will likely increase investors' confidence for the stock, as it reflects on the firm's strong financials and growth potential. Bonus issue essentially are free shares offered by a company from its reserves. Investors must own shares of the company as on the record date to be eligible for the bonus issue.
