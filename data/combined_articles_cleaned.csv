QSR stocks: Devyani up 9% despite wider Q3 loss; Westlife Foodworld jumps 11% post-Dec quarter results; here's why,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/qsr-stocks-devyani-up-9-despite-wider-q3-loss-westlife-foodworld-jumps-11-post-dec-quarter-results-here-s-why-13812394.html,"The shares of quick service restaurants (QSR) companies Devyani International and Westlife FoodWorld rallied in trade on February 5 after the companies announced their earnings for the October-December quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026. Devyani International, which operates KFC and Pizza Hut outlets in India, saw its shares rally around 9 percent to a three-week high of Rs 133.84 apiece on Thursday. The shares of Westlife FoodWorld, which operates McDonald's franchisees in India, rallied nearly 11 percent to Rs 528.90 apiece. Devyani International Q3 Results: Devyani International on February 4 reported a consolidated net loss of Rs 10.39 crore for Q3 FY26, as compared to a net loss of Rs 49.20 lakh in the same quarter of the previous financial year. The firm’s net loss however narrowed sequentially from the Rs 21.9 crore reported in Q2 FY26. The company’s revenue from operations rose more than 11 percent to Rs 1,440.9 crore during the quarter under review. Devyani International reported 95 net new store additions in the quarter, with 54 net additions to KFC India and 18 net additions to Pizza Hut. “We have also started the process of turnaround of the Pizza Hut business by rationalizing loss-making stores. Our idea is to bring a sharper focus to this exercise and therefore we will open new stores only to compensate for the closure of loss-making stores. This will also help us to utilize the existing assets and equipment in our new stores and bring down the capex for the new openings as well,” said Devyani International Non-Executive Chairman Ravi Jaipuria. “DIL is at a critical inflection point in its growth journey, as we prepare to scale into a larger, more diversified and more complex organization. The Board believes that this next phase requires a bold strategic vision, backed by strong execution capability. Accordingly, Manish Dawar shall get elevated as President and CEO for DIL with effect from April 1, 2026,” he added. The company had announced the results in the market hours of Wednesday. The stock had jumped more than 6 percent yesterday, and is extending gains today. JPMorgan remained ‘overweight’ on the stock, with a target price of Rs 155 apiece. It said that the firm’s EBITDA beat estimates on better margins. It added that same-store sales trends improved sequentially, turning positive in January for most formats. Goldman Sachs kept a ‘Buy’ call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 160 apiece. The international brokerage flagged positive January same-store sales but said it is ""too early"" to call it a sustained recovery. UBS kept a ‘Buy’ call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 170 apiece. The international brokerage sees an ""emerging turnaround"" for the company, helped by pricing, promotions and product interventions. It added that improving profitability in KFC and a rationalised Pizza Hut network could aid growth. Westlife FoodWorld Q3 Results: Westlife FoodWorld on February 5 reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 1.02 crore for the October-December quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026. This marks an 85 percent YoY fall from the Rs 7.01 crore net profit reported in the same period of the previous financial year. The earnings were however impacted by a one-time exceptional cost of Rs 9.69 crore arising out of the new labour codes which took effect last year. “Amidst an ongoing challenging operating environment, the company prioritized driving affordability through its value platform while maintaining strict execution discipline. Westlife reported revenue of ₹6.71 billion for Q3 FY26, at the back of recovering guest counts. Same Store Sales Growth (SSSG) was at -3.2% for the quarter. However, positive momentum carried into January, with positive SSSG driven by a mid-single digit increase in guest counts,” the firm said. Brokerage BOB Capital Markets says WEST is at early stages of a guest-count-led recovery, driven by sharper everyday value proposition and improved dine-in execution. Macquarie said that the company saw positive same-store-sales growth on a mild single-digit drop in guest counts in January as it focused on affordability and product innovations. JPMorgan meanwhile noted that McDelivery platform has seen strong growth supported by customer acquisition and growth investments, seeing significant traction in December and January.

"Trent shares up 2% on rise in Q3 net profit; brokerages remain mixed, say 'SSSG growth pressure may persist'",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trent-shares-up-2-on-rise-in-q3-net-profit-brokerages-remain-mixed-say-sssg-growth-pressure-may-persist-13812262.html,"Trent shares traded higher on Thursday after the Tata Group retail firm reported a rise in consolidated net profit for the December quarter of FY26, even as brokerages remained mixed on the outlook, flagging pressure on same-store sales (SSSG) growth. The company posted a 2.73 percent increase in consolidated net profit at Rs 510.11 crore for the October-December quarter, compared with Rs 496.54 crore in the year-ago period. The modest growth came amid improved demand following tax cuts, partly offset by a one-time labour-related charge. Trent reported an exceptional item (net loss) of Rs 26.11 crore during the quarter due to the implementation of new Labour Codes. Shares of Trent were trading at Rs 4,099.10 pe share on the NSE, up 2.16 percent, around 11:20 am. Revenue from operations rose 14.78 percent to Rs 5,345.06 crore in the December quarter, from Rs 4,656.56 crore a year earlier, the company said. ""The gross margin profile of Westside and Zudio remains stable. Operating EBIT margin for Q3FY26 was 13.8 percent, compared with 13.2 percent in Q3FY25,"" Trent said. During the quarter, the company opened 17 Westside and 48 Zudio stores, taking the total store count to 278 Westside and 854 Zudio outlets as of December 31, 2025. This includes four Zudio stores in the UAE. Trent also operates 32 stores across other lifestyle concepts. As of December 31, the company had a presence across 274 cities, with a footprint of over 15 million square feet and a portfolio of more than 1,100 large-format fashion stores. Brokerages maintained a mixed stance on the stock. Bernstein, which has an ‘Outperform’ rating with a price target of Rs 5,000, said Trent’s growth rebound is still unfolding, with store additions, rather than like-for-like sales, expected to drive performance in the coming quarters. HSBC retained a ‘Buy’ rating with a target price of Rs 5,300, citing expected margin gains by FY27 led by sourcing efficiencies and cost optimisation. Kotak, however, maintained a ‘Reduce’ rating with a fair value of Rs 3,850, warning that pressure on same-store sales growth may persist through FY26 due to soft demand and higher costs. It expects only moderate revenue growth into FY27. Commenting on the results, Chairman Noel N Tata said the fashion business registered category-leading growth during the quarter. ""Customer sentiment is gradually improving and our business outlook for the medium term continues to remain positive. Our focus remains on portfolio growth, improving products and enhancing store experience,"" he said. He added that the company remains committed to strengthening its direct-to-customer business across segments, supported by its focus on relevance and resilience in its business model.

"Hindustan Zinc, Vedanta, NALCO, other metal stocks tumble up to 7%: Here are 3 reasons",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/hindustan-zinc-vedanta-nalco-other-metal-stocks-tumble-up-to-7-here-are-3-reasons-13812241.html,"The shares of metal companies sharply dropped in trade on February 5, emerging as the top losers on the market today. Profit booking and fall in precious metals were among the key reasons behind the downturn. The Nifty Metal index fell nearly 3 percent to 11,726 in the early trading hours of Thursday, snapping a three-day gaining streak. Metal stocks plunge: Hindustan Zinc shares dropped around 7 percent to Rs 593.25 apiece, falling below of Rs 600-mark after two days. The shares of the largest producer of silver in India snapped a three-session gaining streak. Vedanta shares fell nearly 5 percent, while National Aluminium Company (NALCO) shares fell around 4 percent, as seen at 9.45 am. Hindustan Copper and Hindalco Industries shares dropped nearly 3 percent each, while NMDC and Lloyds Metals And Energy shares fell around 2 percent each. Steel Authority of India (SAIL) and Tata Steel shares fell more than 1 percent each, while JSW Steel and Adani Enterprises shares fell around 1 percent each. Jindal Steel, APL Apollo Tubes and Jindal Stainless Steel shares were down in the red with marginal losses, while Welspun Corp shares bucked the trend to trade in the green with marginal gains. Here are key factors behind the downturn in metal stocks today: Profit-booking: The sharp fall in metal stocks comes as investors may have resorted to profit booking at elevated levels. The Nifty Metal index gained more than 6 percent in the past three sessions to close at 12,044.25 yesterday. Stronger dollar: The US dollar remained steady ahead of interest rate decisions from the European Central Bank and the Bank of England. The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback's strength against a basket of six currencies, was up 0.2% at 96.671, having traded near a two-week high earlier. The dollar has gained some strength this week as financial markets assess U.S. corporate earnings season, now halfway complete, and stocks turn risk-off. A stronger dollar makes commodities like metals, which are priced in dollars, more expensive. As a result, the metal companies see some pressure on demand, and thereby on prices. Fall in precious metals: Gold futures with April expiry fell around 3 percent to Rs 1,48,455 per 10 grams on Thursday. The contracts with June expiry also fell around 3 percent. Silver futures with March expiry dropped 6 percent to Rs 2,52,719 per kilogram. The contracts with May expiry also fell 6 percent. Several of the metal companies like Hindustan Zinc and others are producers of these commodities. Hence, the fall in the prices of these precious metals will likely impact the stocks.

Silver ETFs drop up to 18% as white metal's futures drop 11% on MCX; gold ETFs down 5%,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/silver-etfs-drop-up-to-16-as-white-metal-s-futures-drop-6-on-mcx-gold-etfs-down-5-13812159.html,"Gold and silver exchange traded funds (ETF) dropped in trade on February 5 as precious metals lost steam. This came after gold and silver prices were rebounding for the last two sessions following a sharp slump earlier. Silver saw a sharper fall today, with its ETFs crashing up to 16 percent in the early trading hours of Thursday. Gold and silver prices drop: Gold futures with April expiry fell around 3 percent to Rs 1,48,455 per 10 grams on Thursday. The contracts with June expiry also fell around 3 percent. Silver futures with March expiry dropped 11 percent to Rs 2,39,000 per kilogram. The contracts with May expiry also fell 11 percent. Gold and silver ETFs crash: Mirroring the sharp fall in precious metals, gold and silver ETFs dropped in trade. Kotak Silver ETF crashed around 18 percent to Rs 228.56 apiece, while Edelweiss Silver ETF fell more than 15 percent. 360 One Silver ETF, Mirae Asset Silver ETF, UTI Silver ETF, Axis Silver ETF, ICICI Prudential Silver ETF, HDFC Silver ETF and others fell around 12-14 percent each. Among the gold ETFs, Motilal Oswal Gold ETF declined around 5.5 percent. Edelweiss Gold ETF, Choice Gold ETF, Axis MF Gold ETF, DSP Gold ETF, ICICI Prudential Gold ETF, 360 One Gold ETF, SBI Gold ETF and few others fell around 5 percent each. What lies ahead? Today's fall may have been driven by profit booking after two days of gains. Markets are now focused on US ADP non-farm payrolls data and final services PMI readings from major global economies, said Kaynat Chainwala, AVP Commodity Research, Kotak Securities. However, the analyst added that the primary focus remains on Friday’s official US jobs report for signals on the timing of the next Federal Reserve rate cut. “CME FedWatch currently shows no easing priced in until May, with June reflecting just a 44.1% probability of a 25bp cut versus a 44.9% chance of rates being held unchanged,” Chairwala said. The ""flash crash"" in gold and silver, triggered by a hawkish US Fed nominee and increased margin requirements, is viewed by many as a necessary cooling of ""overbought"" markets rather than a trend reversal, said Abhinav Tiwari, Research Analyst at Bonanza. He however noted that the long-term outlook remains structurally bullish, despite the volatility. “Record central bank buying, silver’s persistent supply deficit, and geopolitical tensions provide a solid floor,” he said. “We have maintained a cautious stance on silver following its parabolic move and have suggested trimming overallocation to precious metals to realign portfolios with long-term strategic allocation levels. While it is prudent to wait for further information and trend confirmation, we currently prefer gold from a relative risk-reward perspective,” said Siddharth Srivastava, Head - ETF Product & Fund Manager, Mirae Asset Investment Mangers (India).

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Hero MotoCorp, Sarda Energy, Max Financial Services, Hindalco, Larsen & Toubro, and others on February 5?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-hero-motocorp-sarda-energy-max-financial-services-hindalco-larsen-toubro-and-others-on-february-5-13811703.html,"Equity benchmarks extended their uptrend for the third consecutive session, with the Nifty 50 rising 0.2 percent amid healthy market breadth on February 5. A total of 2,012 shares saw buying interest compared to 911 shares that were backed by bears. Consolidation with range-bound trading may continue over the next couple of sessions. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Nilesh Jain, VP- Equity Technical & Derivative Research at Centrum Broking Hero MotoCorp | CMP: Rs 5,851.5 Hero MotoCorp has broken out of a falling channel on the daily chart and has also decisively moved above its 50-DMA at Rs 5,836. With this breakout, it is now trading well above both its short-term and long-term moving averages, indicating sustained strength. From a derivatives perspective, the addition of fresh long positions, with open interest rising by around 6 percent, further reinforces the positive bias. Considering the overall technical setup, a conservative upside target is placed near the Rs 6,300 level in the near term, while crucial support is seen at Rs 5,670. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 6,300 Stop-Loss: Rs 5,670 Sarda Energy & Minerals | CMP: Rs 521.35 Sarda Energy has registered a fresh breakout from a descending triangle pattern on the daily chart. The sharp price up-move is accompanied by a notable surge in volumes, which validates the bullish breakout. Earlier, the stock had formed a double-bottom pattern near the Rs 455 level and witnessed a strong rebound from that base. Momentum indicators are also aligned with the positive bias, as the RSI has moved above the 60 mark and the MACD has generated a bullish crossover, signalling improving upside momentum. Overall, the technical structure indicates that the stock is well positioned to move toward the Rs 555 level in the near term, while immediate support at the 200-DMA is placed near Rs 499. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 555 Stop-Loss: Rs 499 CCL Products | CMP: Rs 1,002.85 CCL Products (India) has witnessed a strong breakout from an inverted head-and-shoulders pattern on the daily chart. The move is backed by higher-than-average volumes, lending credibility to the breakout and highlighting strong buying interest. Additionally, the stock is trading firmly above all its short-term moving averages, which reinforces the bullish momentum. Based on the pattern projection, the potential upside target is placed around the Rs 1,075 level, while the neckline near Rs 961 is likely to act as an important support zone on any pullback. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,075 Stop-Loss: Rs 961 Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical and Derivatives Research at SBI Securities Steel Authority of India | CMP: Rs 157.29 SAIL has staged a strong rebound from its 50-day EMA, reinforcing the prevailing uptrend. On the daily chart, the stock continues to form a higher top–higher bottom structure, signalling sustained bullishness. The RSI has bounced from 53 to 62, reflecting improving momentum. The DI+ crossover above DI- on the ADX indicator highlights strengthening trend support. With prices holding near the upper Bollinger Band, the stock appears well positioned to extend its upward move in the near term. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 158–156 with a stop-loss at Rs 152. On the upside, it is likely to test the Rs 168 level in the short term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 168 Stop-Loss: Rs 152 Max Financial Services | CMP: Rs 1,708.2 Max Financial Services has rebounded sharply from its key upward-sloping trendline support, drawn by connecting the lows of Rs 1,451 and Rs 1,502 formed on August 4 and October 27, 2025, respectively. The stock now trades above its key short- and long-term moving averages. The RSI has surged from 31 to 60 in just seven sessions, signalling strong bullish momentum. The DI+ crossover above DI- on the ADX indicates bulls gaining control, while the MACD has crossed above its signal line, supporting further upside potential. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 1,715–1,705 with a stop-loss at Rs 1,660. On the upside, it is likely to test the Rs 1,830 level in the short term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,830 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,660 Larsen & Toubro | CMP: Rs 4,087.1 Larsen & Toubro has staged a strong rebound from its 200-day EMA on the daily chart, signalling a shift in trend. The RSI has recovered sharply from an oversold level of 24 to 61, indicating strengthening bullish momentum. Rising MACD histogram bars further support the positive bias. The Infra index has moved from the lagging to the improving quadrant on the Relative Rotation Graph (RRG), highlighting improving sector-wide momentum, with L&T leading the move. Strong price action and sectoral momentum suggest the stock is well placed to extend its uptrend. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 4,090–4,050 with a stop-loss at Rs 3,920. On the upside, it is likely to test the Rs 4,400 level in the short term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 4,400 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,920 Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities Hindalco Industries | CMP: Rs 965 Hindalco Industries has been sustaining above the 20 EMA after a brief corrective move. On the hourly chart, it has witnessed a consolidation breakout, indicating improving optimism. The hourly RSI is in a bullish crossover, pointing to positive momentum.

The stock lost 44 percent from its high of November 20 till January 27 followed by few days of consolidation and the spurt seen in the past two days.

The US tariff impact reflected in the quarterly numbers of October-December 2025. Profit fell sharply by 71 percent to Rs 14.6 crore, down from Rs 50.3 crore in the corresponding quarter of previous fiscal, though revenue saw a marginal decline of 0.92 percent to Rs 978.65 crore against Rs 987.76 crore in the same quarters. The company reported an EBIDTA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) of Rs 96 crore (falling 18 percent YoY) with margins at 9.7 percent (down 202 bps YoY) in Q3FY26, impacted mainly due to US tariff rebates, the company in its filing said.

Weak global cues and a selloff in heavyweight IT stocks—amid rising concerns over the impact of artificial intelligence—dragged the benchmarks lower at the open. However, the Nifty index staged a smart recovery from the low of 25,563.95 in the early hours and then traded in a narrow range for the remainder of the session to close with little change. At close, the Sensex was up 78.56 points or 0.09 percent at 83,817.69, and the Nifty was up 48.45 points or 0.19 percent at 25,776. Broader markets outperformed, with the Nifty Midcap index rising 0.6 percent and the Smallcap index gaining 1.2 percent.

The Nifty IT index plunged 6 percent, marking its biggest single-day fall since April 4, 2025, as stocks such as Infosys, TCS, Tech Mahindra, HCL Technologies and Wipro came under heavy pressure.

Click to View More Nearly 90 stocks touched their 52-week lows, including Happiest Minds, Newgen Software, KPIT Technologies, Rainbow Child, among others. Click to View More Outlook for February 5 Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities After showing a massive upmove and the formation of huge opening upside gap on Tuesday, Nifty moved up gradually amidst range movement on Wednesday and closed the day higher by 48 points. Nifty opened on a weak note on the backdrop of selling pressure in IT sector and recovered smartly from the lows of 25563 levels. It later moved into a range bound action with positive bias for the mid to later part of the session. A small bullish candle has been formed on the daily chart with minor upper and lower shadow. The said market action indicates a breather type pattern in the market after a massive upmove of Tuesday. The huge opening upside gap of Tuesday remains intact with partially filled. The underlying short-term trend of the Nifty continues to be positive. The next upside hurdles to be watched around 26000 and next 26350 levels in the near term. Immediate support is placed at 25600. Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets traded range-bound on Wednesday as investors assessed follow-through activity after Tuesday’s strong rally triggered by the India–US trade deal. After a flat start, the Nifty oscillated within a narrow band through the session and ended marginally higher at 25,779.5. Sectoral trends were mixed, with buying interest visible in auto, metal and energy stocks, while the IT index declined sharply and underperformed the broader market. Market breadth remained firmly positive, supported by a sustained rebound in midcap and smallcap stocks. Sentiment stayed cautious amid mixed global cues and some profit booking following the recent relief rally. Weakness in global technology stocks weighed on domestic IT counters, leading to sectoral divergence. At the same time, optimism surrounding the India–US trade agreement and expectations of improved foreign participation continued to support cyclical stocks and select heavyweight names. After the recent sharp swings, some consolidation would be healthy as long as the Nifty holds the 25,400–25,500 zone. On the upside, the index may attempt a move towards the 26,000 level, followed by a gradual push towards record highs. Among key sectors, banking, energy, metal and auto continue to show resilience, while pharma, FMCG and IT remain relatively subdued. Participants should align positions accordingly, with an emphasis on stock selection and disciplined trade management.

Total cost for the AP project may be revised upward to Rs1,100– 1,200bn from Rs960bn, due to rupee depreciation. The AP refinery will be housed under a separate entity, with BPCL exploring a strategic partnership, including discussions with foreign partners; Oil India has already signed a nonbinding MoU for participation in the project. BPCL’s cumulative capex over the next 5 years is guided at Rs2,500–2,700bn. Annual capex is expected to be Rs200-250bn over the initial 2 years, ramping up to Rs500-600bn p.a. over the subsequent 3 years. Further, BPCL continues to source non-sanctioned Russian crude, in the absence of any formal communication from the ministry. Additionally, if given the opportunity to purchase Venezuelan crude, BPCL will first test its feasibility/combability with the pipelines and refinery.

The dip was mainly due to the price declines of key industrial gases – argon, oxygen, and nitrogen – led by muted demand in the steel industry. We expect the growth momentum to accelerate, driven by the ramp-up of the Uluberia-II (220 TPD) facility and the commissioning of the East India Onsite Plant (320 TPD) in 1QFY27.

The stock slipped to an intraday low of Rs 944.15 on the NSE before recovering most of the losses. At around 1.45 pm, shares were trading at Rs 970.20, up 0.6 percent. Brokerage Jefferies, which has a ‘buy’ rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,270, said the December-quarter profit missed expectations due to one-time provisions and labour-law related costs. It added that core profit rose about 23 percent year-on-year after adjusting for one-offs. Jefferies noted that loan growth moderated to 22 percent year-on-year, but said asset quality improved and the company’s credit cost guidance was encouraging. It continues to maintain Bajaj Finance as a top pick. Antique Stock Broking, which has a ‘buy’ call with a target price of Rs 1,070, said higher provisions impacted profitability but described the move as prudent and supportive of asset quality over the medium term. Ambit Capital maintained a ‘sell’ rating with a target price of Rs 713, citing structurally higher credit costs following tighter loss norms and increased competition from banks, which it said could delay recovery to a 20 percent return on equity. Emkay Global Financial Services, which has a ‘reduce’ rating and a target price of Rs 950, said the spike in provisions was largely discretionary. It added that underlying business momentum remains intact, with improving bad loan trends and a steady profitability outlook. The company reported a 6 per cent decline in consolidated net profit to Rs 4,066 crore for the third quarter of the current financial year. The company had reported a net profit of Rs 4,308 crore in the year-ago period. Total income rose to Rs 21,215 crore for the third quarter of the ongoing fiscal year from Rs 18,058 crore in the year-ago period, Bajaj Finance said in a regulatory filing. The consolidated assets under management improved to Rs 4,88,477 crore at the end of December 2025 compared to Rs 3,98,043 crore in the third quarter of last year. Net interest income grew to Rs 11,317 crore as against Rs 9,382 crore in the third quarter of FY25. With regard to asset quality, the gross non-performing assets (NPAs) of the company increased to 1.21 per cent from 1.12 per cent during the same period a year ago. However, Net NPAs declined marginally to 0.47 per cent as compared to 0.48 per cent a year earlier.

Cement NSRs remained flat amid a weak pricing environment, partly supported by a higher premium cement share of ~35% during the quarter. Higher clinker production and purchases, elevated power & fuel costs (+9% YoY), and one-off cost pressures (Rs150/t) related to branding transition and higher freight, along with weak performance of acquired assets negating operating leverage, led to EBITDA/t of Rs712 (PLe: Rs900). The management reiterated its focus on cost optimization, guiding for total cost to decline to ~Rs4,000/t by FY26 exit, ~Rs3,850/t by FY27, and ~Rs3,650/t by FY28, driven by savings across RE power, fuel, logistics and RM sourcing.

Further AJP’s play on high growth branded generics (BGx) market spread across India, Asia and Africa which contributed 70% to total revenue in 9MFY26. Strong annual free cash flow of Rs8–10bn further supports sustained investments and potential inorganic opportunities, reinforcing medium-term growth visibility. Outlook Overall, we expect EBITDA/PAT CAGR of 17% over FY26-28E with healthy RoE/RoCE of 28%/35% in FY27E. At CMP, AJP is trading at 24x P/E and 17x EV/EBITDA as of FY28E.

SaaSapocalypse: What about Anthropic's new AI tool is spooking investor sentiment towards software firms?,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/saasapocalypse-what-about-anthropic-s-new-ai-tool-is-spooking-investor-sentiment-towards-software-firms-13810364.html,"Global tech stocks, along with Indian peers, crashed after Anthropic's launch of a legal AI tool retriggered concerns around rising competition. Analysts have commented on what excatly is bothering the software stocks today. The sharp fall in the share prices pushed the Nifty IT index down more than 7 percent to hit an intraday low of 35,809.50 on Wednesday. The index then pared some losses to close at 36,345.65. Heavyweight Infosys shares plunged more than 8 percent earlier during the day, before closing over 7 percent down in the red. LTI Mindtree and Coforge shares, which also dropped 8 percent intraday, fell around 6 percent at close. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) shares closed 7 percent lower, while Persistent Systems, Mphasis and HCL Technologies shares fell 6 percent. Tech Mahindra and Wipro shares fell around 4 percent each. 'Nowhere to hide,' says JP Morgan: JPMorgan in its latest report noted that the software collapse has broadened with ""nowhere to hide"" as the AI rate-of-change has extrapolated in both “logical and illogical ways”. “The software selloff has intensified and broadened in a particularly jarring manner today…One very noticeable difference in recent weeks is that the impact is very broad, spanning across mega cap to small cap and fully impacting names that have been viewed as carrying lower AI disruption risk,” it said. Indeed, Indian IT stocks earlier had remained resilient during previous tech selloffs on AI threats. However, the stocks today lost steam and crashed amid rising worries of AI intensifying competition. 'SaaSpocalypse' “We call it the ‘SaaSpocalypse,’ an apocalypse for software-as-a-service stocks,” Bloomberg quoted Jeffrey Favuzza, who works on the equity trading desk at Jefferies, as saying. “Trading is very much ‘get me out’ style selling,” the analyst added. “This is especially worrying for software companies as it has the potential to decimate their models with AI likely able to fully replace traditional workflow lock-in SaaS products,” the report further quoted Ortus Advisors analyst Andrew Jackson as saying. From an analytical standpoint, the emerging consensus among market observers is that AI-related concerns around Indian SaaS and IT services companies are not misplaced, even if they are being unevenly priced across the sector, said Bhavik Joshi, Business Head, INVasset PMS. 'AI agents questioning need for multiple software layers' ""The current anxiety is rooted in the rapid evolution of general-purpose AI agents capable of executing workflows end-to-end, which raises legitimate questions around the durability of effort-based revenue models and the need for multiple software layers. This has prompted investors to reassess long-duration growth assumptions, particularly for business models dependent on linear headcount scaling, narrow workflow automation, or feature-led differentiation,” the analyst explained. In this context, Indian technology firms with meaningful exposure to application maintenance, testing, support services, and basic SaaS workflows such as document processing, ticket management, or rule-based compliance appear more vulnerable to pricing pressure, licence rationalisation, and slower volume growth as enterprises experiment with AI-led productivity tools, he said. Why Indian IT companies may be at risk? While analysts caution against extrapolating this risk across the entire technology ecosystem, they also acknowledge that the transition could be more disruptive for Indian IT than prior cycles of automation or cloud adoption, Joshi said. He explained this is because of the speed at which AI capabilities are evolving. “Importantly, enterprise behaviour suggests budget reallocation rather than outright withdrawal, but this reallocation is increasingly biased toward outcomes, speed, and platform efficiency rather than incremental manpower deployment,” he added. This dynamic is likely to compress billing rates, shorten deal cycles, and weigh on near-term earnings visibility—factors that equity markets tend to penalise aggressively, according to Joshi. “The prevailing view is that current volatility reflects a time-horizon mismatch, where long-term structural risks are being discounted into near-term valuations before new operating models are fully proven. For Indian IT stocks, this phase is less about loss of relevance and more about margin, growth, and multiple pressure during a prolonged adjustment, suggesting that the risk-reward may remain skewed to the downside until clearer evidence of adaptation emerges,” he concluded. What Zoho CEO says about AI threat to SaaS firms: The stock market is becoming very negative about the prospects of SaaS companies in the AI-assisted Code era, said Sridhar Vembu, Fourder and CEO of SaaS firm Zoho. ""Well before the AI revolution, I have said SaaS industry is ripe for consolidation. An industry that spends vastly more on sales and marketing than on engineering and product development was always vulnerable. The venture capital bubble and then the stock market bubble funded a fundamentally flawed, unsustainable model for too long. AI is the pin that is popping this inflated balloon,"" he wrote on X. ""Can Zoho survive the AI wave? It depends on our ability to adapt. I always ask our employees to calmly contemplate our death. When we accept that possibility, we become more fearless and that is when we can calmly chart our course,"" he said. The stock market is becoming very negative about the prospects of SaaS companies in the AI-assisted Code era. Well before the AI revolution, I have said SaaS industry is ripe for consolidation. An industry that spends vastly more on sales and marketing than on engineering and… https://t.co/JHhodD4VPo — Sridhar Vembu (@svembu) February 4, 2026 Wall Street ended yesterday's session sharply lower as investors remained concerned that AI was creating more competition for software makers, after Anthropic’s launch of a legal tool for its Claude AI chatbot. AI developer Anthropic launched plug-ins for its Claude Cowork agent last week that can automate tasks across legal, sales, marketing and data analysis. The move has triggered worries of an impending AI-fueled disruption of the data and professional services industry, which were once seen as major beneficiaries of the AI era, according to traders and analysts. “Anthropic launched new capabilities for its Cowork to the legal space, heightening competition,” Morgan Stanley analysts including Toni Kaplan wrote in a note on Thomson Reuters, as reported by Bloomberg. “We view this as a sign of intensifying competition, and thus a potential negative,"" they said. AI heavyweights Nvidia and Microsoft saw their share prices fall almost 3 percent each, while Alphabet dropped 1.2 percent ahead of its results on Wednesday. Amazon shares declined 1.8 percent ahead of its Thursday results. Salesforce and Adobe fell around 7 percent each. Freshworks shares crashed 10 percent.

Buy City Union Bank; target of Rs 310: Prabhudas Lilladher,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-city-union-bank-target-of-rs-310-prabhudas-lilladher-13810212.html,"Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on City Union Bank CUB saw yet another strong quarter with a 15.2% beat on core PAT owing to better core revenue i.e. NII/NIM and fees. Credit growth at 21.5% YoY and 5.9% QoQ was also higher suggesting there was no compromise on NIM to achieve growth. Reported NIM increased by 29bps QoQ to 3.9% due to (1) better loan yields (led by robust growth in higher yielding gold loans, which are fixed rate) and (2) 16bps fall in deposit cost due to repricing. Bank expects NIM to remain stable as negative impact of Dec’25 repo cut would be offset by further deposit repricing while fixed rate loan exposure is at ~30%. Asset quality continues to remain benign as recoveries have surpassed slippages since past 10 quarters. Outlook Due to better NIM/growth, we upgrade core PAT for FY27/28E by avg. 7.3%. With core RoA for FY28E like to be 1.5%, we increase multiple to 1.7x from 1.6x and raise TP to Rs310 from Rs265 as we roll over to Mar’28 ABV. Retain ‘BUY.

The strong outperformance was driven by concerted ministry-level interventions to address the right of way (RoW) challenges, alongside the adoption of insulated cross arm (ICA) technology, which helps reduce RoW requirements by 30–40%. Post Q3FY26, PWGR has raised its FY26E/FY27E capitalization guidance by 10– 15%. On the growth front, the transmission bidding pipeline remains strong. Out of the ~Rs6.6trn ISTS opportunity, projects worth ~Rs2.4trn have already been bided and ~Rs700bn are at various stages of bidding and approvals. This implies an annual bidding opportunity of ~Rs900bn over the medium term. PWGR has orders worth Rs1.45trn in hand, and to execute these, it has outlined a robust multi-year capex plan of Rs320bn in FY26E, Rs370bn in FY27, and Rs450bn in FY28. Capitalization is expected to ramp up with a 2-year lag, rising from ~Rs220bn in FY26 to ~Rs350bn by FY28. Outlook Given its dominant market position, regulated return profile, strong capex visibility, and healthy dividend yield of 3–3.5%, PWGR remains the best proxy to play India’s transmission capex upcycle.

These stocks added to the sharp rally seen in the previous session. The companies derive a significant portion of their revenues from exports to the United States. The shares had earlier come under pressure after the US raised tariffs on Indian exports. Shares of Gokaldas Exports surged 20 percent to hit an intraday high of Rs 832.85 on the NSE. The stock opened with a gap-up gain of 12.15 percent and has risen over 41 percent in the past two sessions. Among other textile stocks, K P R Mill gained 2.62 percent to Rs 1,014.90 per share. Indo Count Industries jumped around 11 percent, while Arvind advanced over 2 percent. Kitex Garments was up about 12 percent. According to ICICI Securities, a reduction in reciprocal tariffs from 50 percent to 18 percent, along with recent trade deals with the UK and the European Union, is expected to provide a multi-year advantage to the textile sector by boosting earnings and cash flows through an expanded export base and capacity additions. The cut in US tariffs to 18 percent from 50 percent earlier gives India a competitive edge over other Asian exporters, where tariff rates range between 19 percent and 30 percent, ICICI Securities said. Shrimp exporters also witnessed strong buying interest. Avanti Feeds rose 12 percent and Apex Frozen Foods climbed 10 percent, while Coastal Corporation hit the 5 percent upper circuit.

The shares of eClerx Services crashed nearly 10 percent to trade at Rs 4,459 apiece. Naukri.com-parent Info Edge shares plunged nearly 7 percent to Rs 1,166 apiece. The company provides BPO-related services primarily through its recruitment-focused divisions and subsidiaries like Quadrangle. Firstsource Solutions and Hinduja Global Solutions shares dropped around 2 percent each. What triggered the tech selloff today? Wall Street ended yesterday's session sharply lower as investors remained concerned that AI was creating more competition for software makers, after Anthropic’s launch of a legal tool for its Claude AI chatbot. AI developer Anthropic launched plug-ins for its Claude Cowork agent last week that can automate tasks across legal, sales, marketing and data analysis. The move has triggered worries of an impending AI-fueled disruption of the data and professional services industry, which were once seen as major beneficiaries of the AI era, according to traders and analysts. Why are BPO stocks falling today? BPO (Business Process Outsourcing) companies are specialized firms that handle non-core operational tasks for other businesses, such as customer support, finance, IT services, and human resources. The improving AI technologies hold the possibility of replacing several human jobs, directly threatening BPO companies. “Anthropic launched new capabilities for its Cowork to the legal space, heightening competition,” Morgan Stanley analysts including Toni Kaplan wrote in a note on Thomson Reuters, as reported by Bloomberg. “We view this as a sign of intensifying competition, and thus a potential negative,"" they said. “The significance of platforms now deploying AI-driven systems capable of executing complex SAP migrations and enterprise transformations in weeks—work that previously required years of human-led effort—cannot be overstated. This is not incremental automation; it represents a fundamental compression of time, cost, and manpower across core enterprise processes,” said Bhavik Joshi, Business Head, INVasset PMS.

Revenue increased 11.5 percent to Rs 3,567 crore. The pace of profit growth, however, lagged revenue as reported margins compressed. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBTIDA) was flat at Rs 816 crore and EBITDA margin fell to 22.9 percent from 25.6 percent, reflecting the impact of one‑time items that the company adjusted for. Adjusted EBITDA rose to Rs 923 crore with a 25.9 percent margin, down 170 basis points (bps) bps from the previous year but up sequentially from 25 percent in Q2, as management cited improving mix and the BSV consolidation benefit. “Mankind’s revenue increased 11.5 percent YoY, with adj EBITDA margins of 25.9 percent percent primarily due to improvement in domestic pharma and BSV consolidation,” vice chairman and managing director Rajeev Juneja said in the statement. The company remains focused on scaling chronic therapies and its women’s health portfolio post the BSV acquisition. Mankind’s domestic business, which still anchors the P&L, grew 11.1 percent to Rs 3,046 crore, aided by base business growth and BSV consolidation. Exports rose 14.1 percent to Rs.521 crore. But the company flagged a gap between its secondary sales growth and the broader market - secondary sales grew 8.5 percent versus 11.8 percent for the Indian Pharmaceutical Market (IPM), “primarily due to underperformance in acute therapies amid ongoing corrective actions,” the company said. Chronic remains the brighter spot. Juneja said Mankind’s chronic share increased 200 bps to 39.3 percent, driven by strong growth in key therapy areas — cardiac grew 16.7 percent and anti‑diabetes 14.4 percent. The company highlighted outperformance in anti‑diabetes to key brand families, including Telmikind and Lipirose/Statpure. In consumer health, momentum improved sequentially but remained modest. Over-the-counter (OTC) revenue rose 5.2 percent YoY in Q3FY26, reversing a decline of 2.6 percent in the previous quarter, with modern trade and e‑commerce share increasing to 13.1 percent from 9.8 percent a year ago, supported by around 40 percent. “Revenue from OTC grew by 5.2 percent in Q3FY26 versus -2.6 percent in Q2FY26. We expect growth to improve further,” Juneja said. A key investor focus remains the company’s leverage after acquiring BSV. As of December 31, Mankind reported net debt of Rs 4,294 crore, down from Rs 6,739 crore in year-ago period. Net debt to EBITDA also trended lower, declining from 2.2x to 1.3x over the period shown in the presentation, indicating that cash generation is helping deleverage post‑acquisition. For the nine months ended December 2025, consolidated revenue climbed 18.7 percent to Rs 10,835 crore, but PAT fell 12.6 percent to Rs 1,379 crore, with margins lower year‑on‑year. Management’s focus Juneja said Mankind is building long‑term growth on four pillars — base domestic business, faster‑growing specialty chronic, high‑potential OTC, and BSV’s super‑specialty portfolio. The investor presentation reiterated that BSV’s integration is progressing, with the super‑specialty portfolio described as a high‑entry‑barrier platform for medium‑ and long‑term growth.","Adjusted EBITDA rose to Rs 923 crore with a 25.9 percent margin, down 170 basis points (bps) bps from the previous year but up sequentially from 25 percent in Q2, as management cited improving mix and the BSV consolidation benefit.","But the company flagged a gap between its secondary sales growth and the broader market - secondary sales grew 8.5 percent versus 11.8 percent for the Indian Pharmaceutical Market (IPM), “primarily due to underperformance in acute therapies amid ongoing corrective actions,” the company said.",Mankind Pharma Ltd net profit (PAT) rose 9.5 percent year‑on‑year to Rs 414 crore in the December quarter led by stronger domestic pharma performance and consolidation benefits from Bharat Serums and Vaccines (BSV) even as it continued with corrective actions in underperforming acute therapies.,"Over-the-counter (OTC) revenue rose 5.2 percent YoY in Q3FY26, reversing a decline of 2.6 percent in the previous quarter, with modern trade and e‑commerce share increasing to 13.1 percent from 9.8 percent a year ago, supported by around 40 percent."
IT stocks fall up to 8%: How big a threat is Anthropic's AI tool for Indian IT firms? Here's what analysts say,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/it-stocks-fall-up-to-7-how-big-a-threat-is-anthropic-s-ai-tool-for-indian-it-firms-here-s-what-analysts-say-13810106.html,"The shares of Indian IT companies crashed on February 4, after Anthropic's launch of a legal AI tool retriggered concerns around rising competition. Analysts have cautioned investors of a possible structural disruption, but highlighted the silver lining behind the AI threat. The Indian IT companies are accompanying global peers, with Wall Street closing in the deep red earlier yesterday. The sharp fall in the share prices pushed the Nifty IT index down more than 7 percent to hit an intraday low of 35,809.50 on Wednesday. The index then pared some losses to close at 36,345.65. Heavyweight stocks like Infosys, Tech Mahindra, LTI Mindtree, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and others fell up to 8 percent during the day. The sharp selloff erased Rs 2 lakh crore from the total market capitalisation of India's top IT stocks. ""The rally fuelled by the US-India trade deal will face hurdles to sustain. The IT selloff in the US yesterday will drag the Indian IT index, too, constraining the rally in the Indian market. Since valuations continue to be high there is no fundamental support for a sustained rally,"" said VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited. Why are IT stocks plunging today? Wall Street ended yesterday's session sharply lower as investors remained concerned that AI was creating more competition for software makers, after Anthropic’s launch of a legal tool for its Claude AI chatbot. AI developer Anthropic launched plug-ins for its Claude Cowork agent last week that can automate tasks across legal, sales, marketing and data analysis. The move has triggered worries of an impending AI-fueled disruption of the data and professional services industry, which were once seen as major beneficiaries of the AI era, according to traders and analysts. “Anthropic launched new capabilities for its Cowork to the legal space, heightening competition,” Morgan Stanley analysts including Toni Kaplan wrote in a note on Thomson Reuters, as reported by Bloomberg. “We view this as a sign of intensifying competition, and thus a potential negative,"" they said. What lies ahead? The sharp correction in the Nifty IT index needs to be viewed through the lens of structural disruption rather than just cyclical weakness, said Bhavik Joshi, Business Head, INVasset PMS. “Recent commentary from global enterprise technology leaders highlights a shift that markets are still in the process of digesting: AI is no longer augmenting services, it is beginning to replace large portions of traditional, labor-intensive workflows,” he said. “The significance of platforms now deploying AI-driven systems capable of executing complex SAP migrations and enterprise transformations in weeks—work that previously required years of human-led effort—cannot be overstated. This is not incremental automation; it represents a fundamental compression of time, cost, and manpower across core enterprise processes,” the analyst explained. This can create near-term anxiety for service-heavy IT models built on long execution cycles and linear headcount growth, Joshi said. As Indian enterprises integrate Claude for critical coding workflows, dependency on large vendor teams may decline, squeezing billable hours and margins, said Systematix Group analyst Ambrish Shah. Anthropic's advanced AI systems also threaten entry‑level talent pool at Indian IT firms by replacing routine development and testing tasks, he added. Is there a silver lining to the AI threat? Joshi explained that technology adoption accelerates during periods of macro uncertainty. “When margins tighten and execution risk rises, enterprises gravitate toward tools that deliver speed, predictability, and scalability. AI-led enterprise platforms thrive precisely in these environments. What equity markets are currently pricing is near-term earnings visibility; what enterprises are investing in is long-term operational resilience,” he said. The analyst explained that history suggests that sharp drawdowns in technology stocks often occur at moments of inflection—when old delivery models are being questioned but new ones are not yet fully reflected in financial statements. “The current correction appears less a signal of declining relevance and more a reflection of markets struggling to price a rapid shift in how enterprise value will be created going forward,” he said. “However, markets often conflate disruption with destruction. While certain service-oriented roles will inevitably face pressure, the broader implication is a redefinition of value creation rather than its elimination. Enterprises are not reducing spend; they are reallocating it—from effort-based billing toward outcome-based execution, platform-led delivery, and AI-native architectures. In such transitions, incumbents with deep domain expertise, data access, and client trust are more likely to adapt than be displaced,” Joshi added. Siddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director, Vibhavangal Anukulakara, said that the sell-off in Indian IT stocks appeared to be more of a sentiment-based reaction than a sudden deterioration in fundamentals. He said that the markets may be overestimating the AI threat in the short term. “AI will certainly disrupt pricing and delivery structures, but it will also increase the addressable market for early movers. In the short term, IT stocks are likely to remain volatile as investors recalculate margins and visibility. In the medium term, IT companies that adopt AI capabilities will lead the charge, and the laggards will fall behind,” he said. ""This current IT stock crash is more of a knee-jerk reaction,"" Informist quoted Sumit Pokharna, Vice President of Research at Kotak Securities, as saying. There are fears that the number of clients for core software developers may be hurt by AI tools, considering that AI players could replace core software and business models based on outsourcing, according to the analyst. However, Pokharna believes investors need to wait and watch how customisable these AI models can be as Indian IT companies operate at a service-provider level for US companies, relatively shielded to AI-related developments.

The stock declined 8.34 percent to an intraday low of Rs 4,097.60 on the National Stock Exchange, dragging investor sentiment a day after it had posted strong gains. According to a report in The Economic Times, three private sector companies have been shortlisted to develop and manufacture next-generation fighter aircraft under the Advanced Multirole Combat Aircraft (AMCA) programme, with the final selection expected within the next three months. The report, citing sources, said that following the evaluation of technical bids submitted by seven Indian entities, Tata Advanced Systems Ltd, Larsen & Toubro and Bharat Forge have been shortlisted, while the remaining bidders, including Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd, have been ruled out of the process. HAL shares had risen over 3 percent in the previous trading session but surrendered all those gains on Wednesday following the report. The stock had also come under pressure earlier this month after brokerages flagged the absence of major policy announcements for the defence sector in the Union Budget, despite an increase in capital expenditure allocation. Defence stocks witnessed a sharp sell-off after the Budget was presented on February 1, with several frontline and mid-cap stocks declining 5–10 percent in a single session. Nomura had said the Budget lacked ""big bang"" measures for the sector, though it viewed the increase in defence capital expenditure as a positive.

SPARC wins USFDA priority review voucher tied to Sezaby approval,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sparc-wins-usfda-priority-review-voucher-tied-to-sezaby-approval-13807337.html,"Sun Pharma Advanced Research Company Ltd. (SPARC) on Tuesday said the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) has granted a Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher (PRV) linked to the approval of its neonatal seizure therapy Sezaby, giving the drug developer a potentially valuable strategic tool to accelerate future medicines. PRVs are tradable vouchers issued by the USFDA to incentivize development of treatments for rare pediatric conditions, and can be redeemed to secure a priority review for a separate, future drug application—often shaving months off the review clock for high-value assets. SPARC said it intends to use the voucher to “further accelerate” its pipeline, signaling it may either deploy the PRV internally for a key program or potentially monetize it depending on strategic needs. “Receiving this Priority Review Voucher is a significant milestone for SPARC and a testament to our commitment to addressing the urgent, unmet needs of patients,” said Anil Raghavan, CEO of SPARC. “This award not only recognizes the therapeutic value of Sezaby but also provides SPARC with additional strategic flexibility to accelerate our pipeline development to bring more therapies to patients faster.” The PRV is associated with Sezaby, which SPARC described as a benzyl alcohol- and propylene glycol–free formulation of phenobarbital sodium powder for injection, approved by the USFDA for the treatment of neonatal seizures—a clinical setting where safety considerations around excipients can be particularly important. For SPARC, the voucher adds another layer of optionality as it pushes its innovation-led portfolio forward. Shares of SPARC rose 6 percent and were trading Rs 141.30 on BSE on Tuesday at 10.30 am.","Sun Pharma Advanced Research Company Ltd.

"Q3 Results impact: Bajaj Housing Finance shares surge 6%; Mobikwik, Ather Energy rally up to 19%",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/q3-results-impact-bajaj-housing-finance-shares-surge-6-mobikwik-ather-energy-rally-up-to-19-13808352.html,"Bajaj Housing Finance, Mobikwik and Ather Energy shares jumped in trade on February 3 after the three companies released their results for the October-December quarter of the financial year 2026. This comes as markets overall remained strong after India and US concluded their much-awaited trade deal. Bajaj Housing Finance Q3 Results: The shares of the Bajaj Group-company jumped nearly 6 percent to Rs 94.77 apiece, before paring some gains. This is the highest level seen by the stock in nearly a month. Bajaj Housing Finance on February 2 reported a net profit of Rs 664.89 crore for the third quarter of FY26. This marks a 21 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise from the Rs 548.02 crore net profit reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year. The non-banking financial institution’s net interest income meanwhile rose 19 percent YoY to Rs 963 crore in Q3 FY26 from Rs 806 crore in Q3 FY25. Its gross non-performing asset margin stood at 0.27 percent and net NPA margin at 0.11 percent as of December 31, 2025, shrinking from 0.29 percent and 0.13 percent, respectively, a year earlier. Motilal Oswal kept a ‘Neutral’ rating with a target price of Rs 100 apiece for Bajaj Housing Finance. This implies an upside potential of 11.5 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. The domestic brokerage noted that the management highlighted that pricing pressure in the prime and super-prime segments remains high, which may continue going forward. In the near prime and affordable segments, while pricing pressure is relatively lower, the number of players looking to enter and expand in these segments remains high. “We continue to believe in management’s ability to improve profitability, supported by a healthy AUM CAGR of 23% over FY25-28E, broadly steady NIMs, and benign credit costs. We expect BHFL to deliver strong AUM growth, but rising competition from PSU banks and higher BT-OUTs may push BHFL to cut its lending rates, which could exert pressure on NTI,” it added. Mobikwik Q3 Results: Mobikwik swinged to black, posting a consolidated net profit of Rs 4 crore for the October-December quarter of the financial year 2026. This comes against a net loss of Rs 55.28 crore for the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year. The firm’s revenue from operations meanwhile rose more than 7 percent to Rs 288.95 crore in Q3 FY26, from Rs 269.48 crore for Q3 FY25. Mobikwik shares jumped 19 percent to trade at Rs 235.90 apiece on Tuesday. Ather Energy Q3 Results: Ather Energy shares jumped nearly 13 percent to trade at Rs 684.85 apiece. This comes after the electric two-wheeler maker posted a net loss of Rs 84.6 crore for the quarter, down 57% from Rs 197.5 crore in the same period last year. Losses also narrowed sequentially from Rs 154.1 crore in the September quarter, reflecting improving operating leverage. Revenue from operations rose 50 percent year-on-year to Rs 953.6 crore, compared with Rs 634.9 crore a year earlier, driven by higher electric scooter deliveries and better realisations. Including other income, total income stood at Rs 995.7 crore for the quarter. Nomura kept a 'Buy' call on the stock, and raised its target price for the stock to Rs 812 from Rs 790 earlier.

Several of these companies have strong exposure to US markets, deriving a major portion of their revenue from exports to the country. The sharp reduction in the tariffs boosted investor sentiment for these stocks. India-US trade deal: ""Out of friendship and respect for Prime Minister Modi and, as per his request, effective immediately, we agreed to a Trade Deal between the United States and India, whereby the United States will charge a reduced Reciprocal Tariff, lowering it from 25 percent to 18 percent,"" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social after a telephonic conversation with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Trump described Modi as “one of my greatest friends” and a “powerful and respected leader of his country,” adding that the two leaders discussed trade, global security and efforts to end the Russia Ukraine war. At 18 percent, India’s tariff rate is now lower than that of several major Asian trading partners, supporting growth in labour-intensive and export-oriented sectors such as textiles, gems and jewellery, and engineering goods, said Dhiraj Relli, MD & CEO, HDFC Securities. ""Labour-intensive sectors such as textiles, gems & jewellery and garments are likely to benefit the most,"" said Angel One. ""Textiles, gems and jewellery, leather goods, handicrafts, toys, auto components which are not only export sensitive but also are large employers and labour intensive. For each of these sectors this along with the EU deal is a double positive as it opens up avenues to expand exports afresh with a zeal,"" said Anitha Rangan, Chief Economist RBL Bank. Gems and jewellery stocks: Goldiam International shares rallied 20 percent to hit the upper circuit at Rs 357.70 apiece. The company had strong export exposure to US markets.

Hold Steel Authority of India; target of Rs 151: Prabhudas Lilladher,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/hold-steel-authority-of-india-target-of-rs-151-prabhudas-lilladher-13808103.html,"Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Steel Authority of India SAIL delivered strong operating performance in Q3FY26, driven by 7.4% YoY volume growth (ex. NMDC Steel trading volumes of 0.37mt) and higher OOI worth Rs12.8bn. However, weaker steel prices limited EBITDA/t to Rs4,465/t. Management expects sequential improvement in EBIDTA/t, supported by rising demand, inventory liquidation (holds 1.5mt finished), and rising steel prices across flats (~Rs3,500/t) and longs (~Rs2,500). However, we believe sharp rise in coking coal prices may limit the EBITDA/t expansion in the next 2 quarters. SAIL has increased its FY27 capex guidance considering ISP expansion and it would further intensify in FY28/29E. Although SAIL will benefit from higher steel prices in near term, EBITDA expansion will also be limited due to sharp rise in coking coal prices which will hit in subsequent quarters. ISP expansion would drive volumes from FY30E provided timely execution. Most of the order placement for 4.5mtpa ISP project has been completed and groundwork has begun. Other debottlenecking and VAP projects at DSP (1mtpa TMT in H2FY28 and 1mtpa BF), RSP and BSP are on track. We expect SAIL to remain a play on steel prices as long-term volume growth would depend upon timely execution of planned capex. Outlook We raise our FY27/28E EBITDA estimates by ~9/12% on higher steel prices and a gradual tapering of coking coal costs but TP gets restricted on higher capex outflow and incremental debt. At CMP, the stock is trading at an EV of 5.5x/5.4x FY27/FY28E EBITDA which appear full considering rising leverage and weak execution pedigree.

The announcement boosted sentiment across EMS stocks on expectations of improved export prospects to the US. According to ICICI Securities, lower US tariffs could benefit EMS exporters such as Dixon Technologies, Kaynes Technology and Syrma SGS by enhancing export competitiveness and supporting margins. India Electronics and Semiconductor Association (IESA) President Ashok Chandak said the India-US trade deal could act as a major catalyst for India’s electronics, semiconductor and technology ecosystem. The agreement is expected to improve market access and facilitate smoother flow of capital equipment and advanced technologies, he said. Chandak added that, when complemented by initiatives such as iCET and TRUST, the deal could help strengthen trusted supply chains and deepen technology collaboration between the two countries. He further said the vision of USD 500 billion in bilateral trade could translate into over USD 100 billion in trade for the electronics and semiconductor sector. The development comes in the backdrop of Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s Union Budget proposals. On February 1, Sitharaman announced an increase in the outlay for electronics manufacturing to Rs 40,000 crore for the 2026-27 financial year. Presenting the Union Budget for 2026-27, she also said that high-tech tool rooms would be set up at two locations to support capital goods manufacturing.

"India-US trade deal impact: Nifty 50 to hit 30,000 by 2026-end as sentiment improves, say analysts",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/india-us-trade-deal-impact-nifty-50-to-hit-30-000-by-2026-end-as-sentiment-improves-say-analysts-13807624.html,"Indian stock markets recorded a sharp rally on February 3 after India and US concluded their much-awaited trade deal. Analysts have suggested what target investors should expect for Nifty 50 as sentiment has improved after the deal. The bilateral trade deal effectively reduces US tariffs on Indian exports to 18 percent from 50 percent. At around 12 pm, Sensex was up around 3 percent (2,444 points) at 84,110.14, while Nifty 50 was up 3 percent (740 points) at 25,828.85. India-US trade deal: ""Out of friendship and respect for Prime Minister Modi and, as per his request, effective immediately, we agreed to a Trade Deal between the United States and India, whereby the United States will charge a reduced Reciprocal Tariff, lowering it from 25 percent to 18 percent,"" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social after a telephonic conversation with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Trump described Modi as “one of my greatest friends” and a “powerful and respected leader of his country,” adding that the two leaders discussed trade, global security and efforts to end the Russia Ukraine war. Why are markets rallying today? With the US trade deal now concluded, a prolonged source of uncertainty for markets is finally behind us, said N. Arunagiri, CEO, TrustLine Holdings. “That overhang had weighed on sentiment and risk appetite for an extended period, and its resolution provides an important near-term relief. However, what matters more for markets from here is what comes after the deal,” the analyst said. Rupee's long-overdue retracement and expected meaningful earnings recovery in FY27, along with structural reforms create a strong and supportive backdrop for markets, said Arunagiri. “From this perspective, the medium-term setup looks increasingly constructive, and we believe these are very positive times for the markets especially for broader small and midcaps,” the analyst added. JP Morgan sees Nifty 50 at 30,000 by 2026-end: JP Morgan reiterated its 2026-end target of 30,000 for Indian benchmark index Nifty 50 after India-US trade deal. This marks a rise of nearly 20 percent (4,922 points) from the previous closing level of 25,088.40. ""A comprehensive bilateral agreement may lead to increased foreign investment, a stronger rupee, and improved earnings visibility for export-oriented sectors,"" JP Morgan said. Indian markets significantly declined earlier amid persistent delays in the conclusion of the deal and limited exposure to artificial intelligence theme, which in turn triggered persistent foreign fund outflows since 2025, leading to underperformance against emerging market peers. “India's valuation premium to EM has compressed significantly, and it now trades at a discount to S&P 500,” JP Morgan said. It added that textiles and apparels, gems and jewellery, engineering goods, chemicals, leather and footwear companies will potentially benefit from the trade deal. “The agreement may also improve earnings visibility for export-oriented sectors such as agriculture and manufacturing, and support a near-term rebound in IT and pharma, led by a reduction in risk premium,” it further said. 'More ambitious year-end trajectory for Nifty 50 after trade deal': Market commentary has started factoring in a more ambitious year-end trajectory for the Nifty 50, with several participants now suggesting that the index could gravitate towards the 30,000 zone if current macro tailwinds sustain, said Harshal Dasani, Business Head, INVasset PMS. ""This optimism is not anchored to a single trigger, but to a convergence of positives that are steadily improving earnings visibility. The India–US trade deal adds to a series of trade agreements signed over the past year, strengthening India’s export outlook and reinforcing its role as a preferred global manufacturing and services hub at a time when supply chains are being rebalanced,"" he said. Domestically, the growth impulse remains consumption-led. Rate cuts over the past year have lowered financing costs, while tax relief measures have increased disposable income for the middle class, translating into stronger discretionary spending, the analyst explained. With inflation largely under control and liquidity conditions supportive, corporate earnings expectations for the coming quarters remain resilient, he added. ""In this environment, the market’s base case is not aggressive valuation expansion, but steady earnings compounding. If growth momentum holds and global conditions remain benign, the 30,000 mark is increasingly being viewed as an achievable milestone rather than an outlier outcome,"" according to Dasani. 'Trade deal instilled confidence in India's earnings trajectory': The trade agreement between India and the US has also instilled a degree of confidence in the earnings trajectory of India, particularly in export-driven segments, and this is why Nifty targets for the year-end are being revised higher, said Siddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director, Vibhavangal Anukulakara. “Essentially, what this does is that it removes policy-related uncertainties and enhances visibility on demand and investment flows,” he explained. According to Maurya, Nifty can easily target the 28,000 level by the year-end if the global environment remains stable and the earnings trajectory of India remains strong. “However, this is not likely to be a straight-line journey,” he added. Some consolidation ahead? Jigar S. Patel, Senior Manager of Equity Technical Research at Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers, however said that he expects Nifty to remain in a consolidation phase between 25,500 – 26,300 for the next few weeks. “A decisive and sustained close above 26,400 will be a major breakout trigger, opening the path towards 28,500 in the medium term. On the downside, 24,500 remains a crucial support for the year, while 26,400 stands as a key resistance zone,” he said. Overall structure remains constructive, but near-term price action suggests range-bound movement before the next directional expansion, the analyst explained.

"Gold, silver ETFs rebound up to 10% after massive crash as precious metals recover: What lies ahead?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/gold-silver-etfs-rebound-up-to-10-after-massive-crash-as-precious-metals-recover-what-lies-ahead-13807293.html,"Gold and silver exchange traded funds (ETFs) rebounded on February 3 after seeing a massive crash during the past few sessions. This comes as precious metals rebounded from their lows. Analysts have said that such a “violent” drop in the precious metals was more like a technical correction than a deterioration in core fundamentals, and that the longer term drivers remain intact. Gold, silver prices recover: Gold futures with March expiry on the MCX jumped nearly 4 percent to nearly hit the Rs 1.5 lakh per 10 grams mark. This comes after the contracts significantly dropped after hitting a fresh lifetime high of Rs 1,93,096 per 10 grams last week. The futures with June expiry also rose 4 percent to Rs 1,52,551 per 10 grams. Silver futures with March expiry meanwhile rallied nearly 9 percent to Rs 2,57,480 per 10 grams. The futures had significantly fallen after hitting a Rs 4,20,048 per 10 grams. Gold, silver ETFs recover: HDFC Silver ETF jumped nearly 10 percent in the early trading hours, while Mirae Asset Silver ETF, SBI Silver ETF, Tata Silver ETF, Groww Silver ETF, UTI Silver ETF anf several others also gained up to 10 percent. Invesco India Gold ETF and Groww Gold ETF gained around 5 percent, while Baroda BNP Paribas Gold ETF, Axis Mutual Fund Gold ETF, HDFC Gold ETF, Nippon India Gold ETF and few others gained around 4 percent each. Why are gold and silver prices rising today? A dramatic unwind which hit gold and silver markets over the past two days, erased a chunk of their record breaking January gains. The plunge began after CME Group hiked margin requirements on both metals, forcing leveraged traders to liquidate positions and accelerating a wave of selling. In additions, the selloff intensified as markets digested reports that US President Donald Trump is set to nominate Kevin Warsh—viewed as a hawkish, dollar supportive choice—as the next Federal Reserve Chair. The shift revived expectations of tighter policy and triggered a sharp rebound in the U.S. dollar, which is negative for precious metals. “The correction was amplified by extreme overbought conditions after gold and silver touched unprecedented highs just days earlier, with silver having surged more than 60% in a month and gold over 20%. Profit taking cascaded into panic selling as liquidity thinned and volatility spiked,” said Hareesh V, Head of Commodity Research, Geojit Investments. “The violent drop more like a technical correction than a deterioration in core fundamentals, noting that longer term drivers—geopolitical tensions, central bank buying and macro uncertainty—remain intact,” he added. ""It's a reasonable call that this is somewhere around fair value potentially, if you consider that we saw a market behaving fairly irrationally for a few weeks there,"" Reuters quoted Kyle Rodda, a senior market analyst at Capital.com, as saying. The sharp rise in the precious metals also comes amid rising expectations for at least two rate cuts by the American Federal Reserve this year.

""Key sectors that can benefit include textiles and apparel, auto ancillaries and engineering, specialty chemicals, agro and seafood exports, and select electronics and consumer manufacturers with US exposure. This aligns well with the recent budget, which clearly focuses on exports, manufacturing, and integrating India deeper into global supply chains,"" said Divam Sharma, Co-Founder and Fund Manager at Green Portfolio PMS. Harendra Kumar, MD of Elara Capital, meanwhile said that key focus areas include medical tourism, the export of skilled professionals to markets such as the UK and the EU, and investments in textile parks, semiconductors, data centres and nuclear energy. ""While the impact will ultimately depend on execution, the Budget presents a clear direction and potential opportunities for long-term growth,"" he added.

US trade deal win may spark foreign buying rush in Indian stocks,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/us-trade-deal-win-may-spark-foreign-buying-rush-in-indian-stocks-13807073.html,"Indian equities are primed to narrow their rare underperformance versus Asian peers after New Delhi and Washington clinched a long-awaited trade agreement, removing a key overhang that had weighed on the nation’s financial assets and triggered record foreign outflows. The accord, announced late Monday night India time, saw President Donald Trump cut the reciprocal tariff on Indian goods to 18% from 25% and eliminate an additional 25% duty linked to India’s purchases of Russian crude oil. The move is widely seen by fund managers as a catalyst for global investors to return to Indian equities, which logged their worst January since 2016, while also offering support to a rupee that has slid to a series of record lows. “This is a good reset to India-US trade that may shift foreign investor sentiment toward India to positive,” said Arvind Chari, chief investment strategist at Q India UK. “India’s underperformance versus emerging markets could reverse.” Early market reaction pointed to rising risk appetite. Nifty 50 futures traded at GIFT City surged as much as 4.5% overnight following the announcement, signaling optimism ahead of Tuesday’s session. Cash equities had shown tentative signs of a rebound earlier in the day, with the NSE Nifty 50 Index climbing 1.1% — its strongest gain in more than two months — even as most Asian markets closed in the red amid a broader regional selloff. The advance came despite investor concerns over a proposed tax hike on equity derivatives in the Feb. 1 budget and a sharp drop in metal prices that weighed on risk assets globally. India’s valuation premium over Asia has also fallen to its lowest level in nearly five years as concerns about steep US tariffs and a drawn-out earnings slowdown weighed on sentiment. The trade deal’s finalization comes just a day after Sunday’s budget, which offered fresh support for exporters and strategic sectors such as rare earths, reinforcing early signs of improving investor confidence. “It is a great development coming immediately after a path-breaking budget announcement that will lead to a reversal of foreign outflows and also a rally in the Indian currency,” said A Balasubramanian, chief executive officer of Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC Ltd. “Close to $100 billion was waiting to enter into India over the next two to three years, pending the tariff settlement with the US.” Still, not all of India’s challenges have eased. Earnings this reporting season have been mixed, and investors are awaiting clarity on India’s commitment to buy $500 billion of goods from the US as part of the deal. At the same time, scope for further monetary easing is narrowing, with economists in a Bloomberg survey expecting the central bank to hold rates on Feb. 6. “The deal that US officials are outlining seems a relatively favorable one, although there will be questions as to whether the $500 billion in purchase commitments ever come to fruition,” said Michael Brown, senior research strategist at Pepperstone Group. For now, investors are looking past near-term uncertainties, drawing comfort from the finalization of the US-India trade deal and the budget’s growth tilt, which prioritized manufacturing incentives and infrastructure spending. Morgan Stanley expects stronger capital expenditure, services-sector growth and wider AI adoption to underpin earnings growth in the fiscal year beginning April 1. “We remain constructive on Indian equities,” strategists including Ridham Desai wrote in a note before the US trade deal was announced, pointing to the prominence of semiconductors in the budget speech as a signal of long-term growth priorities.","Earnings this reporting season have been mixed, and investors are awaiting clarity on India’s commitment to buy $500 billion of goods from the US as part of the deal.","Indian equities are primed to narrow their rare underperformance versus Asian peers after New Delhi and Washington clinched a long-awaited trade agreement, removing a key overhang that had weighed on the nation’s financial assets and triggered record foreign outflows.",India’s valuation premium over Asia has also fallen to its lowest level in nearly five years as concerns about steep US tariffs and a drawn-out earnings slowdown weighed on sentiment.,"“It is a great development coming immediately after a path-breaking budget announcement that will lead to a reversal of foreign outflows and also a rally in the Indian currency,” said A Balasubramanian, chief executive officer of Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC Ltd. “Close to $100 billion was waiting to enter into India over the next two to three years, pending the tariff settlement with the US.” Still, not all of India’s challenges have eased."
Asian stocks climb with metals as volatility eases,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/asian-stocks-climb-with-metals-as-volatility-eases-13806825.html,"Asian stocks climbed after their steepest two-day drop since April as markets found footing following sharp swings in gold and silver that sent ripples across assets. The precious metals rose in early trading. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed over 1.5%, with technology shares leading. Stocks in South Korea — a poster child for artificial intelligence and one of the world’s best-performing markets this year — recovered after plummeting 5.3% on Monday. Nasdaq 100 Index futures rose 0.7% after Palantir Technologies Inc. posted a stronger-than-expected sales outlook. Gold and silver climbed, clawing back some losses after the abrupt unwinding of a record-breaking rally that had driven prices sharply down in the past two sessions. As sentiment improved, Bitcoin rose to trade close to $79,000. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was a touch weaker after two days of gains following President Donald Trump’s nomination of Kevin Warsh as the next Federal Reserve chief. Unlike the volatile selloff during the Asian session on Monday, Wall Street gauges rose. A demand-related spike in US factory activity was the catalyst for the shift in mood, offering an upbeat signal for the economy and corporate profits. Sustained growth would help provide reassurance that manufacturing is on the mend after languishing the past three years. “Manufacturing activity seems to be emerging from a cold winter,” said Brian Jacobsen at Annex Wealth Management. “We’ve seen signs of life before, only for manufacturing to dip again, but with new orders growing, maybe this revival is real.” Elsewhere, Indian assets will also be in focus after Trump said he will slash tariffs on India to 18% after Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreed to stop buying Russian oil, easing tensions between the two countries. Investors will also be focused on Australia with the country’s central bank expected to raise borrowing costs by 25 basis points when it hands down an interest rate decision later Tuesday. Despite the brighter mood on Wall Street, a gauge of US tech megacaps underperformed on Monday. Walt Disney Co. sank after a tepid forecast. Oracle Corp. is selling $25 billion of investment-grade bonds to help finance infrastructure that powers artificial intelligence projects. But most of the market focus was on precious metals, which clawed back some losses on Monday after another heavy selloff in Asian hours. Precious metals had surged to records last month in a rapid ascent that caught even seasoned traders by surprise. Investors piled into gold and silver on renewed concerns about geopolitical upheaval, currency debasement, and threats to the Fed’s independence. A wave of buying from Chinese speculators supercharged the rally. That flipped on Friday as the US dollar rebounded and the precious metals slid after Trump said he’d nominate Warsh for the Fed chief post. Markets see Warsh as more inclined than other candidates to fight against rising price pressures. That stance may translate into monetary policy aiding the dollar, eroding the so-called debasement trade that had caused gold to soar. “Commodity price action is more about positioning shakeout of weak or leveraged hands than a change in the fundamental story,” said Darrell Cronk at Wells Fargo. “It’s a market to watch for vulnerabilities and extremes.”",Stocks in South Korea — a poster child for artificial intelligence and one of the world’s best-performing markets this year — recovered after plummeting 5.3% on Monday.,That flipped on Friday as the US dollar rebounded and the precious metals slid after Trump said he’d nominate Warsh for the Fed chief post.,Investors will also be focused on Australia with the country’s central bank expected to raise borrowing costs by 25 basis points when it hands down an interest rate decision later Tuesday.,"“We’ve seen signs of life before, only for manufacturing to dip again, but with new orders growing, maybe this revival is real.” Elsewhere, Indian assets will also be in focus after Trump said he will slash tariffs on India to 18% after Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreed to stop buying Russian oil, easing tensions between the two countries."
"Who gains most from India-US tariff rollback? Textiles, chemicals, seafood sectors in spotlight",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/who-gains-most-from-india-us-tariff-rollback-textiles-autos-chemicals-sectors-in-spotlight-13806806.html,"India’s export-oriented sectors are poised for a broad-based upside after New Delhi and Washington clinched a long-awaited trade agreement late on the evening of February 2. Under this agreement, the U.S. reduced reciprocal tariffs on Indian goods to 18 percent from 25 percent. Announcing the deal, US President Donald Trump said it would be ""effective immediately"", signalling swift tariff relief for Indian exporters. Trump, in a post on Truth Social, announced, ""Out of friendship and respect for Prime Minister Modi and, as per his request, effective immediately, we agreed to a Trade Deal between the United States and India, whereby the United States will charge a reduced Reciprocal Tariff, lowering it from 25% to 18%."" Soon after, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, after speaking to President Trump, stated, ""Wonderful to speak with my dear friend President Trump today. Delighted that Made in India products will now have a reduced tariff of 18%. Big thanks to President Trump on behalf of the 1.4 billion people of India for this wonderful announcement."" Notably, the rollback comes after months of stress following steep tariff hikes, in some cases up to 50 percent, that kicked in from August 27, 2025, sharply raising landed costs, hurting competitiveness and weighing on demand for Indian goods in the US, India’s largest export market. With the tariff burden now easing, companies with significant exposure to the US are expected to see relief in margins, improved competitiveness and better order visibility. As per market participants, the tariff cut is a meaningful positive for several export-heavy sectors, including textiles and apparel, seafood, auto ancillaries, engineering goods, chemicals, gems and jewellery, and select consumer exporters. Textiles & Apparel: Clear winner Textiles and apparel are widely seen as the biggest beneficiaries of the pact. The US accounts for nearly 28% of India’s total textile exports, making it the single largest destination for Indian manufacturers. More than half of India’s textile and apparel imports are also linked to US cotton, underscoring deep trade integration. The segment is among the most price-sensitive within India’s export basket. Products such as cotton garments, home textiles and made-ups compete directly with suppliers from Bangladesh, Vietnam and other low-cost hubs. A reduction in tariffs narrows the pricing gap and supports large exporters supplying US retailers in mid-value categories. Companies with higher US exposure are likely to see faster volume recovery and improved pricing power. Stocks with significant US revenue exposure include Indo Count Industries (70%), Kitex (70%), Gokaldas Exports (67%), Pearl Global (64%), Welspun India (61%), Himatsingka Seide (60%), Trident (28%), Vardhman Textiles (25%), SP Apparels (22%), Arvind (14%) and KPR Mills (9%). Chemicals: China-Plus-One tailwind In chemicals, particularly speciality chemicals and intermediates, exports are governed by long-term contracts and stringent compliance norms. While demand is less sensitive to short-term price swings, tariffs directly impact net realisations. The tariff cut strengthens India’s position in US supply chains looking to diversify under China-plus-one strategies. Key beneficiaries include UPL (20-25% US exposure), SRF (20%) and Jubilant Ingrevia (9%). Other potential gainers include Aarti Industries, PI Industries, Atul, Navin Fluorine International, Deepak Nitrite, Vinati Organics, Alkyl Amines Chemicals and Gujarat Fluorochemicals. Engineering Goods: Boost in competitiveness Engineering exporters are also expected to benefit. Engineering goods form the largest share of India’s merchandise exports to the US, spanning industrial machinery, electrical equipment and capital goods. These businesses typically operate on thin, single-digit margins, making tariff relief immediately earnings-accretive. Lower tariffs improve India’s competitiveness versus East Asian suppliers, especially in contract renewals and incremental orders. While volumes may not spike immediately, exporters gain pricing flexibility and stronger negotiating leverage in long-term supply agreements. Stocks with notable US exposure include Sona BLW (40%), Ramkrishna Forging (27%), Bharat Forge (25%), Samvardhana Motherson (18%), Balkrishna Tyres (18%), Sansera Engineering (9%) and Apollo Tyres (3%). Gems & Jewellery: Landed cost relief Gems and jewellery exports, including cut and polished diamonds and gold jewellery, are high-value but fiercely competitive. Tariffs directly impact retail pricing and inventory costs for US wholesalers and retailers. The reduction from 25% to 18% lowers landed costs, easing margin pressure for Indian exporters. Consumer, IT: Sentiment positive Select consumer exporters are also expected to see incremental gains. LT Foods derives 39% of its revenue from the US, followed by Tata Consumer Products at 12% and KRBL at 10%. The IT sector stands to benefit indirectly through improved sentiment and stronger bilateral ties, though tariffs do not apply to software exports as they fall under services trade. Seafood: Demand, margins to stabilise The seafood sector is another key beneficiary, with the US remaining a critical market for Indian exporters, particularly shrimp and frozen foods. Lower tariffs are expected to reduce landed costs, aiding demand recovery and improving earnings visibility. India’s seafood exports to the United States are expected to recover after months of decline, following Washington’s decision to lower tariffs to 18 per cent from 25 per cent, the Seafood Exporters Association of India (SEAI) said on Tuesday. Exports to the US fell 15 per cent by volume to 201,501 tonnes during April–November of the current fiscal, while value declined 6.3 per cent to USD 1.72 billion from USD 1.84 billion a year ago, SEAI General Secretary KN Raghavan said. “With the field becoming level again, exports should get a boost,” Raghavan told PTI. “We expect that with tariffs coming down to 18 per cent, we should get back to previous levels.” Among listed players, Apex Frozen Foods derives 63% of its revenue from the US, followed by Waterbase at 40% and Avanti Feeds at 14%. Companies with higher dependence on the US market could see sharper profitability improvement as volumes stabilise. Markets and sectoral reactions Markets have reacted sharply to the long-awaited announcement. Nifty 50 futures at GIFT City surged as much as 3.8% in thin trading, the US-listed iShares MSCI India ETF rose 3%, and the rupee strengthened 1% in offshore trade. Shortly after the announcement of the deal, Kotak Mahindra AMC MD Nilesh Shah said, ""While devil is in the details, it removes a hanging sword over rupee, equity and rates market. Let us hope that it is a win-win deal for both the countries as they have lot to gain through cooperation."" Welcoming the deal, NSE MD and CEO Ashish Chauhan said in a post on X, ""Welcome move for global trade! Congratulations! After today evening's talks between the US President Mr Donald Trump and the Indian Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, tariffs on Indian goods coming down sharply from 50% to 18% with immediate effect. A big win for businesses, supply chains, and the India-US partnership. Kudos to the teams involved in bringing this historic deal to a close."" Former Finance Commission chairman Arvind Panagariya said, ""Bravo! Two of the world's toughest negotiators come to an agreement. So, we have both the father and mother of all trade deals! Congratulations Prime Minister! India is unstoppable under your leadership!!"" Meanwhile, hailing the historic deal, Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal said the agreement ""unlocks the power of two large democracies working together for the shared prosperity of their people"" and creates unprecedented opportunities for farmers, MSMEs, entrepreneurs and skilled workers. ""This agreement unlocks unprecedented opportunities for farmers, MSMEs, entrepreneurs, and skilled workers to Make in India for the world, Design in India for the world, and Innovate in India for the world. It will help India get technology from the US. It is not just a trade deal – it is a historic turning point that will reshape India-U.S. relations and accelerate our journey towards Viksit Bharat 2047,"" the minister noted.","India’s seafood exports to the United States are expected to recover after months of decline, following Washington’s decision to lower tariffs to 18 per cent from 25 per cent, the Seafood Exporters Association of India (SEAI) said on Tuesday.","India’s seafood exports to the United States are expected to recover after months of decline, following Washington’s decision to lower tariffs to 18 per cent from 25 per cent, the Seafood Exporters Association of India (SEAI) said on Tuesday.","Stocks with significant US revenue exposure include Indo Count Industries (70%), Kitex (70%), Gokaldas Exports (67%), Pearl Global (64%), Welspun India (61%), Himatsingka Seide (60%), Trident (28%), Vardhman Textiles (25%), SP Apparels (22%), Arvind (14%) and KPR Mills (9%).","Trump, in a post on Truth Social, announced, ""Out of friendship and respect for Prime Minister Modi and, as per his request, effective immediately, we agreed to a Trade Deal between the United States and India, whereby the United States will charge a reduced Reciprocal Tariff, lowering it from 25% to 18%."""
"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade eClerx Services, Acutaas, Blue Star, Supreme Industries, IOC, MRPL, and others on February 3 after India-US trade deal?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-eclerx-services-acutaas-blue-star-supreme-industries-ioc-mrpl-and-others-on-february-3-after-india-us-trade-deal-13806779.html,"Equity benchmarks bounced back sharply, rising over 1 percent on February 2 after a day of bloodbath. However, market breadth remained negative, with about 1,597 shares declining against 1,312 advancing on the NSE. The market is expected to return to strong momentum, especially after the United States reduced tariffs on Indian goods to 18 percent from 50 percent. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider after the India–US trade deal: Aditya Thukral, Founder & Analyst of AT Research & Risk Managers eClerx Services | CMP: Rs 4,842.4 A falling trendline breakout has been witnessed in eClerx Services, supported by rising volumes along with a breakout in the 14-period RSI. As the stock is now moving out of a consolidation phase, it appears poised to create fresh all-time highs. The stock price has been consistently trading above the 100-day and 200-day EMAs. Now, as it has also started closing above the 20-day and 50-day EMAs, with all EMAs sloping upwards, it creates a clear-cut opportunity for fresh long positions. The stock price remains in a strong uptrend, marked by the formation of higher highs and higher lows across all timeframes. Recent volume expansion along with the breakout adds confidence for buyers. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 5,350 Stop-Loss: Rs 4,549 Acutaas Chemicals | CMP: Rs 1,937.2 Acutaas Chemicals prices have been consolidating within a box pattern for the past couple of months, and a breakout with rising volumes was witnessed on January 29. A shakeout of weak hands was also observed in the previous trading session, and prices regaining above the breakout levels with rising volumes suggest a possible immediate rally in the stock. The stock is consistently trading above all its major exponential moving averages, namely the 20-day, 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day EMAs, and an imminent uptrend has been established with the formation of higher highs and higher lows across all timeframes. Another leg of the uptrend is expected, as uptrend continuation is visible in price action. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,250 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,780 JK Tyre and Industries | CMP: Rs 524.5 JK Tyre has been consolidating within a box pattern since the breakout from the previous box pattern. The stock is consistently trading above all its major exponential moving averages—20-day, 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day—and an established uptrend is in place with the formation of higher highs and higher lows across all timeframes. Now that prices have started moving upward with volume expansion, any breakout above the recent high of Rs 528.95 would conclude another short accumulation phase and add momentum to the upward journey of the stock. Buying on a breakout above Rs 530 is advisable, with a stop-loss below Rs 506 on a closing basis. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 578 Stop-Loss: Rs 506 Arun Kumar Mantri, Founder of Mantri FinMart Blue Star | CMP: Rs 1,838 Blue Star is currently hovering around strong support zones of Rs 1,800–1,830 on the daily charts, with signs of a breakout formation. Technical indicators are showing strong signals, and a short-term base formation coupled with bullish conditions may attract counter-trend buying at the current juncture. On the other hand, any price breakout above the Rs 1,850 zone, which is a key resistance level, would suggest continuation of the ongoing trend, while a sustained move above Rs 1,880 may trigger short covering in the counter. Short-term resistance is seen around Rs 1,980–2,000. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,995 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,782 Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi Mahindra and Mahindra | CMP: Rs 3,463.2 M&M witnessed a strong rebound after taking support near its 200-DEMA, a crucial long-term moving average that often acts as a dynamic support zone. Notably, this level also coincides with a previous breakout area, reinforcing its technical significance. Adding to the bullish undertone, volumes expanded during the rebound, indicating accumulation at lower levels. On the hourly chart, a clear bullish divergence is visible on the RSI, suggesting that downside momentum is weakening and a potential short-term reversal may be underway. The confluence of 200-DEMA support, prior breakout alignment, rising volumes, and RSI bullish divergence indicates improving sentiment, with the possibility of further upside if the stock sustains above this key support zone. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 3,470–3,340 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,650 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,340 Indian Oil Corporation | CMP: Rs 164.6 IOC has formed a strong base near its 100-DEMA, a level that has acted as a reliable dynamic support in the recent past. The stock has also delivered a decisive trendline breakout, indicating a potential shift in short-term momentum. On the indicators front, a bullish crossover is visible on the MACD, signalling strengthening upside momentum. Additionally, the stochastic oscillator has reversed higher near the 30 zone without entering deep oversold territory, suggesting underlying buying interest and improving price strength. The confluence of 100-DEMA support, trendline breakout, MACD bullish crossover, and stochastic reversal points toward a constructive setup, with potential for further upside if the breakout sustains. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 165–163 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 172 Stop-Loss: Rs 159 Supreme Industries | CMP: Rs 3,600.8 Supreme Industries price action has closed decisively above the Williams Alligator indicator, with all three lines (Jaw, Teeth, and Lips) beginning to align and move parallel to each other. This configuration typically signals the emergence of a fresh trending phase, indicating that the “Alligator” is opening its mouth—a classic sign of a potential new upmove. Adding further strength to the setup, the MACD has delivered a bullish crossover above the zero line, suggesting that momentum has shifted firmly in favour of the bulls and that the broader trend bias remains positive. The combination of a bullish Alligator alignment and a MACD crossover above the zero axis points toward strengthening upside momentum, provided prices sustain above key support levels. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 3,600–3,550 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 4,000 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,350 Vidnyan S Sawant, Head of Research at GEPL Capital Ashok Leyland | CMP: Rs 194.4 On the weekly scale, Ashok Leyland has remained in a positive trend since April 2025, consistently sustaining above its key 5-week and 12-week EMAs. During this phase of higher tops and higher bottoms, the stock has displayed a repetitive price behaviour, typically undergoing shallow price corrections of around 5–7 percent. Such pullbacks are followed by a bottoming-out process, reflecting a classical formation of a healthy and sustainable uptrend. The MACD momentum indicator remains in positive territory and continues to trend higher, indicating ongoing momentum acceleration. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 214 Stop-Loss: Rs 186 Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals | CMP: Rs 177.46 On the monthly scale, MRPL has exhibited a bullish polarity shift, wherein the resistance zone formed during the 2008 and 2017 peaks has now acted as a strong support area. The successful retest in March 2025 marked the resumption of the stock’s primary upward trend. On the weekly scale, the stock continues to form higher bottoms and remains well sustained above its key 12-week and 26-week EMAs. The MACD has also witnessed a bullish crossover, indicating a pickup in momentum and reinforcing the positive trend structure. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 199 Stop-Loss: Rs 168 GE Vernova T&D India | CMP: Rs 3,290.4 GE Vernova T&D has been in a prolonged uptrend since 2023, remaining well positioned above its 20-week and 50-week EMAs, confirming the underlying positive trend. In the current phase, the stock has been range-bound for nearly 25 weeks; however, in Monday’s trading session, it attempted an upside breakout from this range, indicating strong relative strength compared to the broader market. Additionally, the stock is trading above its key 12-day and 26-day DEMAs, further reinforcing trend strength. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,553 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,158","The stock price remains in a strong uptrend, marked by the formation of higher highs and higher lows across all timeframes.","Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 5,350 Stop-Loss: Rs 4,549 Acutaas Chemicals | CMP: Rs 1,937.2 Acutaas Chemicals prices have been consolidating within a box pattern for the past couple of months, and a breakout with rising volumes was witnessed on January 29.","Technical indicators are showing strong signals, and a short-term base formation coupled with bullish conditions may attract counter-trend buying at the current juncture.","On the other hand, any price breakout above the Rs 1,850 zone, which is a key resistance level, would suggest continuation of the ongoing trend, while a sustained move above Rs 1,880 may trigger short covering in the counter."

Brokerages see India’s electronics manufacturing services sector benefitting from the Budget’s pivot toward higher value addition and backward integration. Dixon Technologies shares rose around 2 percent to close at Rs 10,354 apiece on February 2. Syrma SGS Technology shares meanwhile gained more than 1 percent. Kaynes Tech shares however closed in the red today. Budget reforms for EMS sector: While presenting Union Budget 2026, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a sharp increase in the allocation for the Electronics Component Manufacturing Scheme (ECMS) to Rs 40,000 crore. The ECMS, notified by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology on April 8, 2025, was originally launched with an outlay of Rs 22,919 crore over six years. The scheme aims to develop a robust domestic electronics component base by offering targeted incentives across 11 key segments, including printed circuit boards, capacitors, resistors, display modules and other critical components. The enhanced outlay is expected to boost domestic value addition, curb import dependence on critical components, and strengthen the integration of Indian manufacturers into global supply chains. Brokerages on EMS: CLSA said that the budget marks a ""pivot point"" for electronics manufacturing. It added that the government allocation supports domestic component manufacturing and integration. However, it flagged near-term risks from lower smartphone assembly incentives. Jefferies meanwhile said that higher allocation supports the medium-term outlook for electronic companies, but flagged execution timelines and the expiry of assembly-linked incentives as near-term risks for some players. Nomura flagged continued policy support for electronics and semiconductors in the Budget as a key positive within a fiscally restrained framework. ""A boost to the semi-conductor sector and electronics manufacturing along with strategies to establish dedicated Rare Earth Corridors, clearly establishes the intention towards not only making the Indian economy self-reliant, but also ring fence the economy from global unrests that tend to disturb the supply chain ecosystem,"" said Prashant Kumar, Managing Director & CEO of Yes Bank. ""Budget 2026 marks a structural shift in India’s semiconductor strategy by recognising that scale without sustainability is not globally competitive.

Buy Bharat Dynamics; target of Rs 1800: Motilal Oswal,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/buy-bharat-dynamics-target-of-rs-1800-motilal-oswal-13806050.html,"Motilal Oswal's research report on Bharat Dynamics Bharat Dynamics (BDL)’s 3QFY26 performance was weaker than our expectations. Execution was impacted due to delays in component integration from other vendors, while margin was hit by lower revenue and a higher share of bought-out components for Akash and Astra Mk-1. However, order inflows remained healthy for BDL during 9MFY26 at ~INR54b and the company is expecting additional INR40b-50b worth of orders in 4QFY26. Further, the near-to-medium-term rospects also remains strong. We believe that the higher share of bought-out components will continue to weigh on its overall margins. Hence, we cut our estimates by 21%/17%/14% for FY26/FY27/FY28. We thus expect a revenue/EBITDA/PAT CAGR of 35%/55%/44% over FY25-28 and arrive at a revised TP of INR1,800 (vs. INR2,000 earlier), based on 42x two-year forward earnings. Maintain BUY.

Will Budget 2026 deter foreign investors even more? Here's what analysts say,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/will-budget-2026-deter-foreign-investors-even-more-here-s-what-analysts-say-13805954.html,"Indian stock markets have seen significant volatility after Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented Union Budget 2026. Analysts have highlighted what to expect from foreign investors in the near-term. After the Budget yesterday, Sensex crashed around 2 percent and Nifty 50 plunged nearly 3 percent on February 1. However, markets rebounded the next day, with Sensex and Nifty rising more than 1 percent each to end the session at 81,666.46 and 25,088.40, respectively, on February 2. On February 1, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) sold equities worth Rs 588 crore, while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) also remained net sellers, offloading shares worth Rs 682 crore. What bothered the markets yesterday? While presenting Budget 2026, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman raised STT on futures to 0.05 percent from 0.02 percent. This was seen as a significant reason for the market crash yesterday, as investors on the contrary had expected significant relief on this front. For every Rs 1 lakh worth of futures sold, traders will now pay Rs 20 in STT instead of the previous Rs 12.50, explained Ashish Singhal, Co-founder of Lemonn. For a Rs 10,000 option contract sale, STT increased to Rs 10 from Rs 6.25, he added. ""The steep increase in STT on futures and options, coming on top of last year’s hike, is likely to raise impact costs for traders, hedgers, and arbitrageurs. This could cool derivative activity and lead to a reduction in volumes. The intent appears to be volume moderation rather than revenue maximisation, as any potential revenue gain could be offset by lower derivative volumes,"" said Shripal Shah, MD & CEO, Kotak Securities. What boosted markets today? Today’s sharp rise in markets comes amid value-buying, decline in crude oil prices and some positive aspects about the Budget which focused on long-term growth. “The expectations regarding budget was flat, and it came flat as well, so market is recovering from yesterday level. After the sharp selloff seen post the Union Budget 2026, Indian equity markets witnessed a meaningful rebound as investors reassessed the announcements with a calmer lens,” said Abhinav Tiwari, Research Analyst at Bonanza. Will Budget 2026 scare away foreign investors? The STT raise on derivatives in Budget 2026-27 presents a near-term disadvantage for FII flows, particularly for derivative-focused funds, said Nitant Darekar Research Analyst at Bonanza. ""With Rs 41,000 crore in FPI outflows already recorded in January 2026 due to rising US yields and currency pressures, increasing transaction costs diminish post-tax profits, lowering India's competitiveness in comparison to other Asian markets,"" he said. While fundamentally-driven long-only FPIs remain insulated, tactical and high-frequency participants face margin compression, the analyst further said, adding that near-term selloff intensification is probable as reduced trading efficiency compounds existing global risk-off sentiment. ""Sustained FPI revival hinges on macro stability and rupee trajectory rather than transaction tax adjustments alone,"" he added. The initial effect of the Budget on FIIs was negative, mainly because of the increase in transaction taxes and the absence of direct incentives for foreign investments, said Siddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director, Vibhavangal Anukulakara. ""The increase in STT on derivatives will increase the cost of trading, which could be a deterrent for FIIs in the short term. However, policies that increase access to foreign investors and a fiscal agenda could help to stabilize foreign flows in the medium term,"" the analyst said. 'Budget was more about missed opportunities than negative surprises': According to Maurya, the selling trend could be slowed down or reversed if the government brings about FII-friendly reforms, or else it will remain cautious. From an FII standpoint, the Union Budget was more about ""missed opportunities than negative surprises"", said Naren Agarwal, CEO, Wealth1. ""While the commitment to fiscal consolidation, with the fiscal deficit targeted at around 4.3% of GDP, and continued policy support for GIFT City were positives, the sharp increase in Securities Transaction Tax on futures and options significantly raised transaction costs and hurt sentiment, especially for global trading-oriented investors,"" he said. 'Long-term allocators still view India favourably': The Budget did little to counter these global headwinds through capital-market-specific incentives such as rationalisation of capital gains or tax clarity for foreign investors, the analyst added. He explained that any continuation of FII selling is likely to be flow-driven and tactical rather than a structural reassessment of India. ""Long-term allocators still view India favourably within emerging markets, but near-term foreign flows are expected to remain volatile until global interest rate conditions ease,"" he added.

Click to View More Outlook for February 3 Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities After a sharp fall, the Nifty has seen a strong bounce, which is a normal market reaction. However, the broader trend remains weak. As long as the index stays below the 200-DMA, sentiment is likely to remain negative, and any bounce should be used to exit leveraged long positions or to create short positions. On the upside, immediate resistance is placed at 25,200, while on the downside, support is seen around 24,900. Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities Today, the benchmark indices witnessed a promising pullback rally. The Nifty ended 263 points higher, while the Sensex was up by 944 points. Among sectors, the Capital Market Index outperformed, rallying over 3 percent, whereas despite strong momentum, the IT index traded into negative territory, shedding nearly 0.50 percent. Technically, after an early morning intraday dip, the market took support near 24,700/80400 and bounced back sharply. From the day's lowest point, the market rallied over 400/1300 points. Additionally, on intraday charts, it has formed a promising reversal pattern, and on daily charts, it formed a bullish candle, which supports a further uptrend from the current levels. We are of the view that now, 25,000/81500 and 24,900/81200 will act as immediate support zones for the bulls. Above these levels, a pullback formation is likely to continue, with the market potentially moving up to 25,250/82200 or the 200-day simple moving average (SMA). Further upside could also push the market toward 25,350/82500. On the flip side, if the market falls below 24,900/81200, sentiment could change. Below this level, traders may prefer to exit their long positions.

Here's what analysts say: The proposal to provide tax holidays until 2047 for foreign companies providing cloud services globally using data centre infrastructure in India demonstrates long-term strategic thinking, said HDFC Securities. “By enabling critical infrastructure and boosting investment in data centres, this measure positions India favourably in the global digital economy for decades to come,” it added. “The Budget’s focus on attracting global cloud and data centre investment is a strong signal of India’s intent to become a serious digital infrastructure hub. Tax incentives for companies serving global customers from India, along with safe-harbour provisions, create the right conditions for building scalable, enterprise-grade data platforms,” said Varun Babbar, VP and India MD, Qlik. “The proposed tax holiday until 2047 for global cloud service providers operating data centres in India sends a strong signal to long-term investors and hyperscalers. It encourages sustained capital commitment, accelerates large-scale infrastructure build-out, and strengthens India’s position in the global cloud, AI, and digital services value chain,” said Akshay Chhabra, CMD of 1Point1 Solutions.

The Essential Chemicals segment, contributing to 70% of total revenue, declined 6% YoY. EBITDAM for the segment stood at -5.1%, down by 730bps YoY, impacted by falling prices of the key raw material acetic acid, which compressed spreads in ethyl acetate (constitutes 80–85% of the essentials basket). The Specialty Chemicals segment witnessed a 30% YoY revenue decline, impacted by the phase-out of a product contributing to ~10% of the portfolio as well as no sales of campaign product compared to Q3FY25. A replacement for the phased-out product is expected to be launched by Q4FY26. The Fluorochemicals segment remains in the ramp-up phase, with the management guiding for 40–60% of its Rs2bn peak revenue potential to be achieved in FY26. On the demand side, sub-segments such as pharmaceuticals and printing & packaging continued to show stable trends QoQ, agrochemical demand remained moderate, and paints & coatings stayed weak. Ethyl acetate spreads are expected to remain under pressure in the near term. Outlook Hence, we maintain a cautious view on the stock and retain our ‘Reduce’ rating.

Alumina volumes grew 8% YoY to 403kt, while metal volumes grew robust 19% YoY to 126kt aided by exports, strong domestic sales and weak base. Alumina NSR declined 13% QoQ to USD352/t, in line with the fall in alumina prices of 10.5% QoQ, while average NSR for the metal increased 5% QoQ to USD3,072/t. NACL has been focusing on cost reduction, which is evident in the significant decline in P&F and employee costs, driven by higher usage of captive coal, and superannuation-led savings of ~Rs1.18bn in 9MFY26. The management reiterated that the commissioning of the 1mtpa alumina refinery (0.3mt volume in FY27) and the Pottangi bauxite mine remains on track for commissioning in Jun’26. Outlook We raise FY27/28E EBITDA by 6%/4%, assuming higher LME prices of USD3,001/2,932 (earlier USD2,918/2,851). Every USD100 increase in ally prices would lead to ~6% upgrade in our NACL EBITDA.

The low-teen growth in power volumes came despite muted national power demand (-1% YoY), supported by softer shortterm power prices. IEX continues to benefit from a cash-rich balance sheet (cash of ~Rs15bn in Q3FY26, ~13% of market capitalization), negligible capex requirements and high RoE (~40%); however, the proposed market coupling mechanism poses a key overhang on its near-monopoly position in the DAM segment (~40% of its volume) of exchange. We model power volume growth (ex-REC) of 15%/9%/11% in FY26E/FY27E/FY28E, assuming a gradual decline in DAM market share to 85% in FY27E and 70% in FY28E, while maintaining power segment margins at ~Rs0.04/kWh. Following the CERC’s Jul’25 order mandating centralized price discovery for DAM, IEX has appealed to APTEL, with the hearing concluded and an order expected by Q4FY26. Outlook Given the expected moderation in volume growth to ~10% CAGR over FY26–28E from ~20% CAGR over FY20–25, we believe IEX is likely to trade at a lower valuation multiple versus historical levels.

The organic performance translates to revenue decline of ~1.0% QoQ, which is a third consecutive quarter of organic revenue decline. The organic revenue decline attributed to spending that the clients have deprioritized on vehicle architecture and development, especially on the US and Japan PV. Even the deal signing for Q3 remains weak at USD 202m, that translates to 9MFY26 growth of +4.7% YoY. The company has evaluated ways to overhaul its currently “service-led” offerings to off-the-shelf “solution-led” offerings with limited customization on top. Additionally, the revenue cannibalization from service to solution is a gradual move and would require 12-18 months before it completely pivots to new offering mix. We believe the transition would require additional efforts and leadership bandwidth to repurpose its offerings and stay relevant to its strategic accounts. Already a slowdown in Automotive and a transition of offering mix on top would continue to weigh on revenue growth for FY27. Additionally, the company has borrowed ~USD50m to fund the acquisitions that will create additional pressure on the bottom line.

Premium segments, however, continue to do well with doubledigit growth. Demand momentum improved across both urban and rural channels as disruption from GST rationalization stabilized. Given that Dabur has grown by 10% in oral care, we don’t rule out some market share loss for CLGT in toothpaste segment. We expect gradual volume to set in given benefits of GST cuts, however such impact in oral care has been seen to be muted even in 2017-18. CLGT’s longterm drivers remain intact, led by (1) strengthening core toothpaste franchises and (2) premiumization through science-backed innovations within oral care. Outlook However, competitive intensity, higher growth in naturals segment and likely loss of market share remains a drag.

The Nifty Defence index was down 1.76 percent after having fallen around 5.6 percent on February 1, reflecting investor disappointment over the lack of what analysts described as “big bang” measures. Hindustan Aeronautics slipped about 3 percent, Bharat Dynamics fell nearly 6 percent, while Bharat Electronics was trading marginally lower by 0.33 percent. As many as 16 of the 18 constituents of the Nifty Defence index were trading in the red. Brokerages, however, maintained that higher defence capital expenditure should support order inflows over the medium term. The Union Budget raised core defence capital expenditure by 18 percent year-on-year for FY27. The total defence budget now stands at Rs 7.6 lakh crore, up 7 percent from the revised estimate. Citi said continued prioritisation of defence and localisation remains supportive for order inflows, but added that near-term upside could be limited following the sharp rally in defence stocks. Lack of Big Bang Annoucements Nomura said the budget lacked “big bang” measures, even as it viewed the increase in defence capital expenditure as a positive. CLSA said defence spending growth is likely to moderate on a high base after strong increases in FY26. It noted that execution of large orders and exports continue to remain supportive for the sector. The brokerage said adjusted capital expenditure growth is pegged at 10.7 percent in FY27 compared with 6.2 percent in FY26, largely in line with market consensus. It added that defence growth could slow on a high base, while railways and roads may see a pickup on a low base. CLSA also pointed out that the revised defence capital expenditure for FY26 was Rs 2.2 trillion, compared with the budget estimate of Rs 1.8 trillion, and that defence capex in FY27 is expected to grow by a muted 5.2 per cent on this revised base. Defence stocks saw a sharp sell-off in the session following the Budget on February 1, with several frontline and mid-cap names correcting 5–10 percent in a single day.

Markets are currently extending losses after crashing sharply yesterday after Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented Union Budget 2026. Here are some of the key factors behind market fall: Weak global cues: The fall in Indian stock markets comes amid weak global cues. Asian markets remained weak, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 falling 0.98 percent to 52,809. South Korea’s KOSPI fell as much as 5 percent, while China’s Hang Seng dropped nearly 3 percent. Wall Street futures remained weak as well, with Dow Jones futures being down 0.75 percent. STT hike: While presenting Budget 2026, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman raised STT on futures to 0.05 percent from 0.02 percent. This was seen as a significant reason for the market crash yesterday as well, as investors on the contrary had expected significant relief on this front. Benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty fell 2% on Sunday. Goldman Sachs sees near-term valuation risk to Indian equities as unexpected hike in derivatives trading tax adds to already weak foreign sentiment. It added that Sunday's sharp drop reflects a combination of concerns around STT hike on F&O, global sell-off in metals, and domestic selling on low volumes in anticipation of foreign outflows on Monday. The global investment bank said the softer fiscal drag in the budget, along with steady capex spending was largely in-line with its expectations. It however retained its constructive view on Indian equities and expects high-teen full-year returns, driven by underlying earnings recovery. ""This was not a revenue raising measure, but a decision to discourage retail traders from complex F&O trading, in which 92% of them were losing money. This decision is in the interest of retail investors. But this decision impacted the market sentiments, which were already impacted by the decision to make no changes in the LTCGs tax, which a section of the market was expecting rather unrealistically,"" said VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments. FII selling: On February 1, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) sold equities worth ₹588 crore, while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) also remained net sellers, offloading shares worth Rs 682 crore, adding to the pressure on the market. ""The 10% nominal GDP growth projected in the Budget is achievable and has the potential to deliver around 15% earnings growth in FY27. The market will soon start discounting this positive. But it is possible that FIIs may continue to sell impacting the market. Retail investors should keep their cool and remain invested and continue to invest systematically. A significant upturn in the market may take time; perhaps a retreat from AI trade globally. We don’t know when this will happen. But we know that an earnings rebound is imminent in response to this growth oriented Budget. That is a clear positive,"" said Vijayakumar. What should investors do? Given persistent global uncertainties and rising volatility, traders are advised to remain selective and disciplined, focusing on fundamentally strong stocks on declines, said Aakash Shah, Technical Research Analyst at Choice Equity Broking Private Limited. ""Fresh long positions should be considered only after a confirmed and sustained breakout above the 25,000 level on the Nifty, which would signal a meaningful improvement in market sentiment,"" he added. Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research at Kotak Securities, said that the short-term market texture is volatile, and volatility is likely to continue in the near future. ""Hence, level-based trading would be the ideal strategy for day traders. On the higher side, 25,000/81300 would act as a crucial resistance zone. As long as the market is trading below this level, weak sentiment is likely to prevail,"" he said. ""On the downside, the correction wave is likely to continue till 24650-24600/80100-79900. Further downside may also continue, which could drag the index till 24500-24300/79600-79000. On the flip side, above 25,000/81300, the market could move up to 25,200/81900 or the 200-day SMA,"" he added.

"Gold, silver ETFs recover partially as precious metals rise up to 9% from day's lows: Here's what analysts say",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/gold-silver-etfs-recover-up-to-10-after-crash-analysts-say-long-term-outlook-remains-bullish-13804872.html,"Gold and silver exchange traded funds (ETFs) made a partial recovery on February 2, after crashing sharply earlier during the day. Analysts have expressed belief in the long-term bullish outlook for the precious metals, despite current volatility. Edelweiss Silver ETF, Kotak Silver ETF, Mirae Asset Silver ETF and Tata Silver ETF, which had hit the 20 percent lower circuit earlier during the day, recovered up to 10 percent. Gold ETFs, which were down up to 9 percent in the early trading hours, were down up to 6 percent, with some already in the green. It is important to note that despite the partial recovery, most of the ETFs are still in the deep red. Gold, silver prices recover: Gold futures with April expiry on MCX, which fell to Rs 1,37,065 per 10 grams earlier during the day, recovered more than 9 percent to recover all losses and trade at Rs 1,49,920 per 10 grams. The contracts with February expiry meanwhile jumped over 3 percent. Silver futures made some recovery from their respective lows, but are still in the deep red. Why are gold, silver prices falling today? Gold and silver ETFs, which earlier saw a significant surge along with the precious metals, have seen a significant decline recently, with the trend continuing today as well. The sharp fall in gold and silver prices came amid rampant profit-booking, along with stronger dollar. US President Donald Trump said he had chosen former ⁠Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh, who is known to be hawkish and rigid about rate cuts, to ⁠head ⁠the American central bank. Additionally, CME Group announced hikes in margins on its metal futures on Saturday and the changes are set to take effect after market close on Monday. This will also likely weigh on precious metals. COMEX gold futures ⁠margins have been raised from 6 percent to 8 percent, while COMEX 5000 silver futures are set to increase to 15 percent ‍from 11 percent. Here's what analysts say: The recent ""flash crash"" in gold and silver, triggered by a hawkish US Fed nominee and increased margin requirements, is viewed by many as a necessary cooling of ""overbought"" markets rather than a trend reversal, said Abhinav Tiwari, Research Analyst at Bonanza. He however noted that the long-term outlook remains structurally bullish, despite the volatility. “Record central bank buying, silver’s persistent supply deficit, and geopolitical tensions provide a solid floor,” he said. “We have maintained a cautious stance on silver following its parabolic move and have suggested trimming overallocation to precious metals to realign portfolios with long-term strategic allocation levels. While it is prudent to wait for further information and trend confirmation, we currently prefer gold from a relative risk-reward perspective,” said Siddharth Srivastava, Head - ETF Product & Fund Manager, Mirae Asset Investment Mangers (India).

"BSE, Angel One, other capital market stocks jump up to 4% after Budget-led crash; Jefferies says STT hike largely manageable",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/bse-angel-one-other-capital-market-stocks-jump-up-to-4-after-budget-led-crash-jefferies-says-stt-hike-largely-manageable-13804696.html,"Capital market stocks jumped in trade on February 2, a day after they crashed following the Union Budget 2026. The sharp rise in the share prices pushed the Nifty Capital Markets index up more than 1 percent to 4,438.95 in the morning trading hours of Monday. STT on F&O increased: While presenting Budget 2026, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman raised STT on futures to 0.05 percent from 0.02 percent. This was seen as a significant reason for the market crash yesterday, as investors on the contrary had expected significant relief on this front. For every Rs 1 lakh worth of futures sold, traders will now pay Rs 20 in STT instead of the previous Rs 12.50, explained Ashish Singhal, Co-founder of Lemonn. For a Rs 10,000 option contract sale, STT increased to Rs 10 from Rs 6.25, he added. As a result, BSE shares tumbled more than 15 percent to Rs 2,377.40 on Sunday, before recovering some losses. The Nifty Capital Markets index plunged 6 percent to close at 4,381 yesterday. Jefferies on STT hike: Jefferies however remained broadly optimistic, suggesting that the STT hike is largely manageable. It added that the change should be viewed as a “sentiment negative”, and not a structural change. Industry checks done by the international brokerage suggested around 5 percent volume impact. It added that there may be 5 percent drop in average daily turnover/orders, and this could mean around 4 percent earnings impact for companies like BSE and Groww. Citi on capital markets: Citi said that the STT hike will act as a near-term sentiment overhang, and likely result in a marginal decline in F&O volumes. However, the long-term behavioural change may be limited, it added. The international brokerage said that past STT hikes had muted impact on options turnover. It sees Angel One and Groww facing mild topline pressure due to high F&O mix, with minimal impact for others like Nuvama. Capital markets stocks: BSE shares gained nearly 4 percent to trade at Rs 2,694.50 apiece. Nuvama, Angel One and Motilal Oswal Financial Services shares gained around 2 percent each, as seen at 10.15 am. HDFC AMC and CAMS shares gained around 1 percent each. CDSL, Anand Rathi, IEX, MCX and few other capital market stocks however bucked the trend to trade in the red.
