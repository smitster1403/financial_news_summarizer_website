26 small caps gain 10-40% despite underperformance by broader indices,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/26-small-caps-gain-10-40-despite-underperformance-by-broader-indices-13330904.html,"The broader indices erased previous week gains, underperforming the main indices with a loss between 0.7-2.5 percent in the volatile week amid mixed India corporate earnings, uncertainties over US-India, continued outflow of FII, above average rainfall, and the UK-India trade deal. BSE Mid and Smallcap indices erased the previous week's gains, falling 1.7 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively, while the BSE Largecap index extended the fall in its fourth consecutive week as it ended lower by 0.7 percent. For the week, the BSE Sensex index fell 294.64 points or 0.36 percent to finish at 81463.09, and Nifty50 declined 131.4 points or 0.52 percent to close at 24837. However, in this month till now Sensex and Nifty shed 2.5 percent each. The Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) remained net sellers throughout the week, while Domestic Institutional Investors (DII) compensated with buying the equities. FIIs extended their selling in fourth week, as they sold equities worth Rs 13,552.91 crore, however, DII bought equities worth Rs 17,932.45 crore, extending buying in 14th week. In this month till now, FII sold equities worth Rs 30,508.66 crore, while DII bought equities worth Rs 39,825.97crore. On the sectoral, Nifty Media index shed 5.7 percent, Nifty Realty index declined nearly 5 percent, Nifty IT index plunged 4 percent, Nifty oil & gas and FMCG shed 3.5 percent each. However, Nifty Bank, Pharma and Private Bank indices ended with marginal gains. ""The Indian equity market ended lower for the fourth consecutive week, as weak Q1 earnings and cautious global sentiment weighed on investor confidence. The Nifty 50 breached the key level of 24,900, along with the significant FII’s net short positions reflect broad-based selling pressure,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments. ""Mid- & small-cap indices saw steeper corrections, underperforming the benchmark. The sectoral laggards, including IT and financials, were adversely impacted by subdued guidance and emerging concerns around asset quality. Subpar aggregate earnings performance is likely to challenge the sustainability of current premium valuations across benchmark indices, and we expect a consolidation in the near term."" ""The finalization of the US-Japan and India-UK trade agreements marks a key step in easing global trade barriers. A resolution of the US–India mini trade deal by 1 August could further allay investor concerns. Domestically, the expectation for further rate cuts is also rising on the back of a benign inflationary trend, which will stimulate growth."" ""The ECB has paused monetary policy easing cycles amid concerns over global inflationary pressures from potential tariff implementations. Going forward, the market will be keeping a close eye on key US data such as GDP and jobs data next week, which will influence the Fed's interest rate decision, with the market expecting the Fed to maintain the status quo,"" Nair added further. The BSE Small-cap index plunged 2.5 percent with Indian Energy Exchange, Blue Jet Healthcare, Control Print, Wendt (India), KSolves India, Ion Exchange (India), Ceat, Veranda Learning Solutions, Kirloskar Pneumatic Company, Quick Heal Technologies, Transrail Lighting, PC Jeweller, Ideaforge Technology, Cigniti Technologies falling between 10-34 percent. On the other hand, InfoBeans Technologies, KIOCL, Tilaknagar Industries, Master Trust, SML Isuzu added between 20-40 percent. Where is Nifty50 headed? Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Research, Wealth Management, Motilal Oswal Financial Services We expect market to remain in consolidation mode amid continued uncertainty around India-US trade deal, a mixed Q1FY26 earnings season so far and intensifying FII outflows. Key results over the weekend include Kotak Mahindra bank, Macrotech Developers, CDSL amongst others. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities Nifty remained under sustained selling pressure as the index slipped below the crucial support level of 24,900. Moreover, it has closed below the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (50EMA) for the first time in several sessions, signaling a meaningful weakening of the ongoing trend. Additionally, the index has now fallen back into the zone of the previous swing high on the daily timeframe, which further highlights a potential trend reversal. The current setup appears notably weak and suggests the possibility of a deeper correction. If the Nifty fails to reclaim levels above 24,900 in the next session or two, bulls could face significant short-term challenges. On the downside, immediate support is seen at 24,700, followed by 24,500. On the upside, resistance is now placed around 25,000. Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities The equity markets in India and globally focused on earnings and management commentary during the Q1FY26 earnings season. While aggregate earnings were broadly in line with estimates, the muted outlook provided by a number of companies across sectors dented the market mood. Crude oil price remains range-bound and continues to provide comfort. Further, a good monsoon so far and low inflation numbers are further positive for India. However, uncertainty with trade tariffs continues to impact global and domestic equity market sentiments. Over the next couple of weeks, stock-specific action will continue, led by the Q1FY26 result outcome and management commentary.

"Goodyear launches sale process for Indian arm’s farm tyre business, engages Citi",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/goodyear-launches-sale-process-for-indian-arm-s-farm-tyre-business-engages-citi-13325907.html,"The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co, USA, parent company of India-listed Goodyear India, has put the latter’s farm tyre business on the block and launched the sale process, multiple industry sources in the know told Moneycontrol on the condition of anonymity. The move follows an announcement in April that the Akron, Ohio-based global tyre giant had sought to conduct a review of the vertical. “The deal was launched earlier this week and there is strong interest in the market for the division which has a hefty market share. Primarily strategic suitors have been tapped but there may also be a play for private equity funds who could explore tie-ups with smaller players. The segment has seen successful exits by PE fund in the past,” said one of the persons. In 2016, private equity firm KKR sold its 90 per cent stake in Alliance Tire group to Japan’s Yokohama Rubber for $1.2 billion. Back then, the deal was one of the largest PE exits for an India-related business. According to a second person familiar with the process, investment bank Citi has been engaged as the sell-side advisor and the valuation expectation is around $300 million. In response to an email query from Moneycontrol, on April 21, 2025, The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co, USA, said, “Goodyear informed the India Stock Exchange that the company has placed its farm tire business in India under strategic review. This strategic review is proceeding as planned.” An email query to Goodyear India was left unanswered at the time of publishing this article. When contacted, Citi declined to comment. On April 21, post a board meeting, the Board of Goodyear India disclosed that it had taken note of the communication “received from The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., USA, i.e. the ultimate parent company regarding their intention to conduct a review of the farm tire business of the Company to evaluate all strategic, operational and financial opportunities related to that business.” At the end of day’s trade on July 24, the market cap of Goodyear India stood at Rs 2260.52 crore, with 74 per cent stake with promoter entity ‘Goodyear Orient Company’. For FY24-25, Goodyear India registered a revenue of Rs 2,608 crore and net profit of Rs 55 crore, as per exchange data. In late 2023, Goodyear announced a transformation plan called ""Goodyear Forward"", targeting approximately $2 billion in proceeds through portfolio optimization and $1 billion in cost savings by the end of 2025. The plan included strategic alternatives for its assets like its chemicals business, the Dunlop brand (later sold to Japan’s Sumitomo for $700 million), and off-the-road tire business. The top five listed players in India by net profit in the tyre and rubber products segment include MRF, Balkrishna Industries, Apollo Tyres, CEAT and JK Tyres. Birla Tyres, City Cat Tyres, Ascenso Tyres, Hindustan Tyre Co, TVS Srichakra , Ralco Tyres, Immortal Tyres and Poddar Tyres are some other players. Key global brands include Michelin, Bridgestone and Continental Tires. Incidentally, as part of a strategic realignment, Continental Tires recently shut its truck and bus radial tire business in India due to cost pressures and is now focused solely on the passenger and light truck segment. In recent M&A news in the sector, CEAT - an RPG company - and Michelin, a global tyre company, announced on December 6, 2024 a definitive agreement for CEAT to acquire Camso brand’s Off-Highway construction equipment, bias tyre and tracks business from Michelin in an all-cash deal valued at about $225 million. Lens on Goodyear India Goodyear India manufactures and sells farm and commercial truck bias tyres at its Ballabgarh plant. The company also markets and sells passenger car tyres which are manufactured by Goodyear South Asia Tyres Private Limited, Aurangabad, in the replacement market. Other products which the company markets and sells include tubes and flaps. In its last annual report, the firm had highlighted the difficulties in the farm tyre segment. “The Indian farm tire industry faced a series of challenges, including rising raw material costs, supply chain disruptions, and external pressures such as fuel price volatility and weak agricultural income. These factors contributed to slower growth and reduced demand for farm tires in certain segments of the market. However, despite these challenges, the industry showed resilience and registered growth of 3.8% in the Financial Year 2024-25 on Y-o-Y basis.” Goodyear India elaborated “The Farm OE has seen a growth of 4 percent in the financial year 2024-25 on Y-o-Y basis. Financial Year 2025-26 looks positive, with continued growth in farm mechanization, supported by government initiatives and advancements in technology. However, challenges such as the affordability of equipment for smaller farmers and climate uncertainties remain. OEMs that focus on sustainability, innovation, and accessibility are well-positioned to capture the growing demand for farm machinery in India.”","On April 21, post a board meeting, the Board of Goodyear India disclosed that it had taken note of the communication “received from The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., USA, i.e. the ultimate parent company regarding their intention to conduct a review of the farm tire business of the Company to evaluate all strategic, operational and financial opportunities related to that business.” At the end of day’s trade on July 24, the market cap of Goodyear India stood at Rs 2260.52 crore, with 74 per cent stake with promoter entity ‘Goodyear Orient Company’.","On April 21, post a board meeting, the Board of Goodyear India disclosed that it had taken note of the communication “received from The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., USA, i.e. the ultimate parent company regarding their intention to conduct a review of the farm tire business of the Company to evaluate all strategic, operational and financial opportunities related to that business.” At the end of day’s trade on July 24, the market cap of Goodyear India stood at Rs 2260.52 crore, with 74 per cent stake with promoter entity ‘Goodyear Orient Company’.",Primarily strategic suitors have been tapped but there may also be a play for private equity funds who could explore tie-ups with smaller players.,"On April 21, post a board meeting, the Board of Goodyear India disclosed that it had taken note of the communication “received from The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., USA, i.e. the ultimate parent company regarding their intention to conduct a review of the farm tire business of the Company to evaluate all strategic, operational and financial opportunities related to that business.” At the end of day’s trade on July 24, the market cap of Goodyear India stood at Rs 2260.52 crore, with 74 per cent stake with promoter entity ‘Goodyear Orient Company’."

Sunjay Kapur had passed away at the age of 53 on June 12 after suffering a heart attack in UK. The incident occurred while he was playing polo. Notably, the AGM has already begun with Sunjay Kapur's widow Priya Sachdev likely to attend the meeting, reports said. In her letter, Rani Kapur noted that she is the sole beneficiary of her late husband Surinder Kapur's estate, and the majority shareholder of the Sona Group including Sona Comstar. ""As you are aware, on 12.06.2025, my son Mr. Sunjay Kapur tragically passed away under highly suspicious and unexplained circumstances in the United Kingdom. Despite me seeking information, I have been unable to receive any relevant answers and documents explaining the incident and have been confined to the knowledge and version set out by the media,"" she said in her letter, as quoted by CNBC-TV18. 'Compelled to sign documents without even the time to read them' Rani Kapur alleged that she was ""compelled"" to sign various documents without explanation or even having time to read them during the time of mourning. ""Despite being under immense mental and emotional distress, I was coerced into signing such documents behind locked doors and though I’ve requested repeatedly, the contents of such documents have never been revealed to me. Please also take note that I have been totally denied access to my accounts and have been left to the mercy of a select few for survival. All this, in less than a month of my only son passing away,"" she said in her letter. She alleged that while the family was still in mourning, some people took it as an opportune time to wrest control and usurp the family legacy. She added that several resolutions, including one to appoint director as the representative of the Kapur family, are set to be voted upon during the AGM, without informing the family. ""I've been informed that certain people are representing themselves as being the largest shareholders of the Company since they claim to represent the interest of the family in the Company. I am fully convinced that the documents which were executed by me under coercion and duress, post the demise of my son, at a time of mental and emotional vulnerability are being misused,"" Rani Kapur alleged. Sunjay Kapur's mother further highlighted that she hasn't consented to anyone to represent herself before the company. ""If the Board and the shareholders however choose to ignore this letter, which I am writing in my capacity of not just being the grieving mother of Sunjay Kapur, but also the head of the Kapur family and the largest shareholder of the Company, it would be a clear case of mismanagement and breach of trust by the Company,"" she said while asking the board to unconditionally defer the AGM. The shares of Sona BLW sharply fell nearly 3 percent to trade at Rs 477 apiece in the afternoon.","I am fully convinced that the documents which were executed by me under coercion and duress, post the demise of my son, at a time of mental and emotional vulnerability are being misused,"" Rani Kapur alleged.","""If the Board and the shareholders however choose to ignore this letter, which I am writing in my capacity of not just being the grieving mother of Sunjay Kapur, but also the head of the Kapur family and the largest shareholder of the Company, it would be a clear case of mismanagement and breach of trust by the Company,"" she said while asking the board to unconditionally defer the AGM.","""As you are aware, on 12.06.2025, my son Mr. Sunjay Kapur tragically passed away under highly suspicious and unexplained circumstances in the United Kingdom.","""If the Board and the shareholders however choose to ignore this letter, which I am writing in my capacity of not just being the grieving mother of Sunjay Kapur, but also the head of the Kapur family and the largest shareholder of the Company, it would be a clear case of mismanagement and breach of trust by the Company,"" she said while asking the board to unconditionally defer the AGM."

Pharma was the lone bright spot, with Dr Reddy’s and Apollo Hospitals leading the gains. Broader markets also struggled, with both the Midcap and Smallcap 100 indices slipping over 1 percent. At noon, the Sensex was down 654.81 points or 0.80 percent at 81,529.36, and the Nifty was down 223.70 points or 0.89 percent at 24,838.40.

Sustained FII selling of Rs 11,572 crores in the last four trading days will weigh on the market. The weakness in the broader market, particularly in smallcaps, might continue since valuations had turned excessive and difficult to justify,"" V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments Ltd, said. Trade deal uncertainty with the US and weak Q1 earnings from largecap names will likely have a bearing on the markets, experts say. Markets remained under pressure on July 25, with most NSE sectoral indices trading in the red. Nifty Energy, Auto, Metal, and Smallcap indices, fell between 1.2–1.5 percent. The Nifty Bank index dropped 0.6 percent, while both the Private and PSU Bank indices also saw cuts. The IT, Consumer Durables, and Realty sectors were down around half a percent each. On the positive side, Nifty Pharma bucked the trend with a modest gain of 0.29 percent. Meanwhile, India VIX rose over 5 percent, indicating heightened market volatility.

JPMorgan downgraded its rating on Bajaj Finance to 'neutral', from 'overweight' earlier. The brokerage noted that while Bajaj Finance remains a top-tier NBFC, the unexpected MSME stress and weak 2W/3W loans may lead to earnings downgrades. After crashing almost 30 percent in the previous session, shares of Indian Energy Exchange Ltd (IEX) took a U-turn to soar over 12 percent in the early session on Friday, July 25. Indian Energy Exchange reported a standalone net profit of Rs 113 crore for the first quarter of the financial year 2026, up 21 percent from the Rs 93 crore net profit reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year.

The company’s net profit surged 89.7 percent year-on-year to Rs 140 crore in the April–June quarter. Experts say the positive momentum also stems from the India-UK FTA, which will benefit textile stocks. Technical View ""The Nifty gave up all of Wednesday’s gains, falling 159 points to close at 25,062. On the charts, another bearish engulfing candle has formed—two in quick succession, a rare and bearish signal. Key levels are now well-defined, with 25,000 acting as crucial support and 25,245 as immediate resistance. The bears are likely to stay in control unless the index closes above 25,340. Meanwhile, Asian markets are trading weak, even as US index futures edge higher,"" Akshay Chinchalkar, Head of Research at Axis Securities, said. SBI Life Insurance, Dr Reddy's, Apollo Hospitals, Sun Pharma, and Bharti Airtel were the top gainers on the Nifty. Laggards on the index included Bajaj Finance, Shriram Finance, Bajaj Finserv, IndusInd Bank, and Bajaj Auto.

Brokerages noted that the deal may unlock long term value for the stock. Phoenix Mills released its results in the post market hours of July 24. The firm's net profit rose 3.5 percent on-year to Rs 241 crore in Q1 FY26 from Rs 232.5 crore in Q1 FY25. Its revenue from operations meanwhile rose 5 percent year-on-year to Rs 953 crore during the quarter under review. Operating EBITDA grew 6 percent on-year to Rs 564 crore, while EBITDA margin remained flat at 59 percent. The company announced that its board also approved the proposed transaction for the buy-out of the 49 percent shareholding of Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP Investments) in Island Star Mall Developers Private Limited (ISMDPL). Once completed, the stake buyout will take Phoenix's shareholding in the subsidiary from the existing 51 percent to 100 percent. CPP Investments will exit ISMDPL, a mall and offices development platform that had formed with Phoenix in 2017, with CPP Investments receiving around Rs 5,449 crore as part of the stake buyout. The platform includes a shopping mall in Indore, and two retail-led mixed-use mall-and-office developments in Bengaluru and Pune. In an exchange filing, PML announced that the company will pay the consideration to CPP Investments over four tranches in a three-year period. For FY25, the three projects that are part of the ISMDPL platform, had a consolidated turnover of nearly Rs 920 crore, compared to Rs 612 crore the year prior. ""ISMDPL marked the beginning of our long-standing partnership with CPP Investments. What started with a single asset has grown into a portfolio of premium, retail-led mixed-use developments across key urban centres. As we consolidate our stake in the JV, we remain focused on building on this strong foundation and creating some of the most vibrant and high-performing mixed-use destinations in the country,"" said Atul Ruia, Chairman at Phoenix Mills. He added that the firm’s other collaborations with CPP Investments will continue as planned. The firm's MD Shishir Shrivastava meanwhile said that this transaction will allow the firm to ""consolidate full ownership of a portfolio of high-quality, retail-led mixed-use assets across key Indian cities"". Motilal Oswal Financial Services kept a 'Neutral' rating on the stock, but cut its target price to Rs 1,646 apiece. This implies an upside potential of nearly 14 percent from the stock’s previous closing price of Rs 1,448 apiece. The domestic brokerage noted that the firm's earnings missed its estimates significantly. However, the acquisition may unlock long term value as it strengthens its high quality retail asset portfolio. ""The transaction is expected to be earnings-accretive from year one, with a significant upside when rental income stabilizes and the 2.71msf incremental FSI potential is developed over the medium-term post FY27. Staggered payments over three years takes net debt-to-equity to 0.2x for the FY27 which was expected to net cash earlier,"" it said. HDFC Securities also noted that Phoenix Mills reported a muted quarter, with its earnings missing out on estimates on several fronts. The brokerage however remained positive about the firm's proposed acquisition. ""The transaction implies an EV of Rs 117 bn (5.3% cap rate on FY25 EBITDA, can add INR 65/share to SOTP) for the platform. The deal strengthens Phoenix’s portfolio and offers strategic flexibility for long-term expansion,"" the firm said. Phoenix Mills shares were trading at Rs 1,538 apiece. The stock has gained nearly 3 percent in the past five days, but dropped over 5 percent in the past one month.

"Trident shares rally 7% as Q1 net profit climbs 90%; lower expenses, input costs help",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trident-shares-rally-7-as-q1-net-profit-climbs-90-lower-expenses-input-costs-help-13324583.html,"Shares of Trident Ltd. climbed as much as 7 percent to Rs 33.66 in morning trade on Friday, July 25, after the home textiles and paper products manufacturer posted a sharp jump in quarterly profit, brushing aside a slight dip in revenue. The company’s net profit surged 89.7 percent year-on-year to Rs 140 crore in the April–June quarter, compared to Rs 73.8 crore a year ago. This improvement came even as operating revenue slipped 2.1 percent to Rs 1,706.8 crore. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates What drove the stellar profit growth was a meaningful cut in expenses — down about 7 percent from last year — which helped lift margins. Trident’s EBITDA rose 29.3 percent to Rs 291 crore, and its operating margin expanded to 17 percent from 12.9 percent in the same period last year. Trident, which supplies home textiles to global retail giants like Walmart and Target, also appears to be benefiting from more stable input costs. Cotton prices, which were a drag on margins last year amid an 18 percent surge, have softened in recent months, offering some relief as far as raw material costs are concerned.

SBI Life reported a 14 percent year-on-year rise in net profit to Rs 594 crore for Q1 FY26 up from Rs 520 crore in the same quarter last year. The company’s net premium income for the quarter stood at Rs 17,178.5 crore, marking a 14 percent increase over Rs 15,105.5 crore recorded in Q1 FY25. The value of new business (VNB) generated during the quarter stood at Rs 1,090 crore, reflecting continued growth in new business acquisition. At 9.35 a.m., shares of the firm were quoting Rs 1,834, higher by 2.3 percent on the NSE compared to the previous session's closing price. Should you buy, sell, or hold shares of SBI Life? Hong Kong-based CLSA maintained an 'outperform' rating on SBI Life with a target price of Rs ,180 per share. The brokerage highlighted a strong Q1FY26 performance, with VNB (Value of New Business) margin improving by 60 basis points year-on-year to 27.4 percent. This margin expansion was driven by a shift in the product mix away from ULIPs. However, Annualized Premium Equivalent (APE) growth came in at 9 percent year-on-year, weighed down by a flat performance in the agency channel. Despite this, management remains confident of achieving mid-teens APE growth in FY26. HDFC Securities has a 'high-conviction buy' on SBI Life, anchored on three 'power and sustainable moats.' The first is exclusive access to SBI’s massive distribution network. SBI Life's scope for improvement in margin-accretive traditional mix and cost leadership are the second and third moats.

Brokerages have issued positive notes for the stock, seeing strong upside potential from current levels. REC on July 24 reported a net profit of Rs 4,466 crore for the first quarter of the financial year 2026. This marks an on-year jump of 29 percent from the Rs 3,460 crore net profit reported during the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year. The firm's revenue from operations meanwhile rose 13 percent year-on-year to Rs 14,737 crore in Q1 FY26. It had earlier reported revenue from operations at Rs 13,079 crore in Q1 FY25. Along with the Q1 results, the firm also announced its first interim dividend of Rs 4.60 per share for the ongoing financial year 2026. The record date to determine the eligibility of the shareholders set to receive the payment has been set on August 1. The shares of the company were marginally up in morning trade. The stock gained nearly one percent to trade at Rs 408 apiece. Should you buy, sell or hold? Morgan Stanley kept an 'overweight' call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 485 per share.

TRN Energy Resolution and provision reversals were key drivers of the earnings. UBS kept a 'Buy’ call on the stock, with a target price o Rs 550 per share.

"Hexaware Technologies shares tank 6% on weak Q1, poor guidance",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/hexaware-technologies-shares-tank-6-on-weak-q1-poor-guidance-13324348.html,"Shares of Hexaware Technologies, which recently made its return to the public markets, slipped 6 percent to Rs 779 in morning trade on July 25 after it reported a muted performance for the April-June quarter of 2025, as exceptional costs dragged down profitability. The company follows a calendar-year format for financial reporting. Revenue in constant currency terms rose 1.3 percent, falling short of Street expectations pegged at 2.5 percent for the quarter under review, the company said in an exchange filing. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates The quarter saw a steep rise in other expenses, which surged to Rs 142 crore from Rs 8.7 crore in the year-ago period. This included customer-related provisions of Rs 78.2 crore, ERP transformation costs of Rs 12 crore, acquisition-related expenses worth Rs 12.8 crore, and an impairment of Rs 39.4 crore linked to a customer contract from an earlier acquisition. As a result, operating performance weakened. EBITDA fell to Rs 404 crore from Rs 431 crore last year, and from Rs 527.8 crore in the March quarter. EBITDA margin dropped to 12.4 percent, down from 16.5 percent in the previous quarter and 14.7 percent a year earlier. However, when adjusted for these one-time items, the margin improves significantly to 18.1 percent—up from 17 percent in the March quarter. The company has reaffirmed its full-year EBITDA margin guidance of 17.1–17.4 percent.

This has led Hexaware to tone down its expectations for the remainder of the year. IT services company Hexaware Technologies relisted on stock exchanges after four years, notching up handsome gains on February 19 as the stock ended with gains of 7 percent on debut. The IPO comprised only an offer-for-sale by its promoter, CA Magnum Holdings, which is an investment holding company created by Carlyle to buy Hexaware. The global digital and technology services provider did not get any IPO proceeds, as all the public issue fund was received by the selling shareholder. At about 9:25 am, shares of the company were trading at Rs 782, lower by 5.3 percent from the last close on the NSE. Hexaware Tech shares have been on a solid run lately, rising over 20 percent in the last three months.

Barring pharma, all major sectors slipped into the red, with the broader market taking a heavier hit. At about 10:30 am, the Sensex was down 578 points or 0.7 percent at 81,606, and the Nifty was down 194.5 points or 0.78 percent at 24,867. About 577 shares advanced, 2,045 shares declined, and 86 shares were unchanged. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market opens Trade deal uncertainty with the US and expensive valuations has hit sentiment on the bourses, experts say. ""Though the Q1 earnings are broadly in line, it does not justify the premium valuation; India is trading at a 3-year high of 21x P/E,"" says Vinod Nair, Head of Strategy at Geojit Investments Limited, said. ""We expect stock-specific action to persist as earnings remain the key driver for near-term market direction,"" Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Retail Research at Motilal Oswal, said. At the July 25 market open, sectoral indices were largely in the red, reflecting a subdued start. The Nifty Auto index slipped 0.78 percent, leading the losses, followed by declines in Nifty Media, Metal, and Consumer Durables. Banking indices were mixed—Nifty Bank edged down 0.17 percent, while PSU Bank bucked the trend with a 0.41 percent gain. Nifty IT and Energy also posted mild losses, down 0.19 percent and 0.43 percent, respectively. Broader markets were weak, with the Nifty Midcap 100 down 0.41 percent and Smallcap 100 losing 0.62 percent. Meanwhile, India VIX rose over 5 percent, indicating a sharp uptick in market volatility. Bajaj Finance shares slipped 6 percent after brokerages dished out bearish calls on the stock. This comes after the company reported a 22 percent jump in consolidated net profit at Rs 4,765 crore. Brokerages say that stress in the MSME segment has led to a sharp surge in credit costs. Further, the management raised concerns over continued over-leveraging and warned of potential profitability pressure ahead as loan spreads narrow. SBI Life Insurance shares rose over 2 percent after it reported a 14 percent year-on-year rise in net profit to Rs 594 crore for Q1 FY26, up from Rs 520 crore in the same quarter last year. The company’s net premium income for the quarter stood at Rs 17,178.5 crore, marking a 14 percent increase over Rs 15,105.5 crore recorded in Q1 FY25. JPMorgan downgraded the stock to neutral while CLSA maintained its outperform call. Hexaware Tech shares slumped as much as 6 percent after the company posted a revenue decline in Q2. A spike in other expenses also weighed on margins. On the deal front, management said large consolidation deals remain in progress, while smaller ones are moving forward. However, slower decision-making has tempered expectations for the rest of the year. Technical View Technically, the index has slipped back into a choppy trading band, hovering between its 20-day EMA and 50-day EMA, placed at 25,150 and 24,950, respectively. A sustained breakout above the 25,300 level is still awaited to confirm bullish momentum. On the downside, the 50-day EMA near 24,950, combined with the psychological mark of 25,000, forms a critical support shelf for bulls, possibly their last line of defence. Notably, the 24,800–24,900 cluster has repeatedly served as a strong base throughout the month, and with the index oscillating in this pocket, dips are likely to attract renewed buying as long as 24,800 holds firm. A decisive close above 25,250 remains the key to reversing the current bearish bias and reviving a broader bullish tone. SBI Life, Dr Reddy's Labs, Apollo Hospitals, Trent, Bharat Electronics, and SBI were the top gainers on the Nifty. Laggards on the index included Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv, Shriram Finance, Bajaj Auto, and IndusInd Bank.

Asian markets traded lower, while the US stock market ended mixed overnight, with the Nasdaq and S&P closing at record highs. The Gift Nifty was trading at 24,997, lower by 0.36 percent. Dalal Street came under pressure on Thursday, July 24, as weak earnings and margin misses in the IT and FMCG sectors triggered a selloff. The Nifty IT index dropped over 2 percent, weighed down by Persistent Systems, Coforge, and Infosys. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Foreign institutional investors (FII/FPI) were net sellers on July 24, selling shares worth Rs 2,134 crore, while domestic institutional investors (DII) were net buyers of shares worth Rs 2,617 crore, provisional data showed. Here are the key levels to watch out for in today's session Technically, the index has slipped back into a choppy trading band, hovering between its 20-day EMA and 50-day EMA, placed at 25,150 and 24,950, respectively. A sustained breakout above the 25,300 level is still awaited to confirm bullish momentum. On the downside, the 50-day EMA near 24,950, combined with the psychological mark of 25,000, forms a critical support shelf for bulls, possibly their last line of defence. Notably, the 24,800–24,900 cluster has repeatedly served as a strong base throughout the month, and with the index oscillating in this pocket, dips are likely to attract renewed buying as long as 24,800 holds firm. A decisive close above 25,250 remains the key to reversing the current bearish bias and reviving a broader bullish tone. ""The index remains stuck in a sideways range, reflecting ongoing trader uncertainty. Technically, it faces stiff resistance near 57,350, while strong support lies around 56,600. Unless the index decisively breaks above 57,300, bullish momentum is likely to remain capped,"" Dhupesh Dhameja of SAMCO Securities said. ""On the downside, the 20-day EMA around 56,800 and the horizontal support zone near 56,600 form a crucial buffer. This 56,600–56,800 range has consistently held firm through the month, encouraging buying on dips. A sustained close above 57,350 is key to reversing the bearish undertone,"" he added. India VIX ticked up mildly by 2 percent, settling at 10.72. Despite the rise, it remains comfortably below the psychological threshold of 13, reflecting a market still devoid of panic or aggressive de-risking. The low-volatility backdrop suggests that while intraday selling persists, there’s no fear-driven rush to exit longs, further validating the ongoing phase of range-bound action rather than a decisive trend breakdown. The Put-Call Ratio (PCR) slipped from 1.08 to 0.76, indicating a rise in call writing and a gradual bearish tilt in positioning. This tug-of-war between option writers at 25,000 and 25,200 levels highlights the broader indecision in the market.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Gujarat Pipavav Port, RCF, Swan Energy, Jindal Steel, Shyam Metalics, Dixon Technologies, REC and others on July 25?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-gujarat-pipavav-port-rcf-swan-energy-jindal-steel-shyam-metalics-dixon-technologies-rec-and-others-on-july-25-13322999.html,"The frontline indices could not sustain their previous day's gains due to selling pressure, falling a little over 0.6 percent on July 24, with market breadth dominated by bears. About 1,721 shares saw a correction compared to 921 that advanced on the NSE. The consolidation is expected to continue, with benchmark indices likely finding support at the 50-day EMA. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Jay Mehta, Technical Research at JM Financial Services Gujarat Pipavav Port | CMP: Rs 165.83 GPPL has broken out from a symmetrical triangle pattern and has successfully retested the breakout zone, rebounding strongly. The breakout was accompanied by a significant volume surge, with an additional volume spike observed on the recent bullish Belt Hold candle formed at the 200-day EMA—indicating bullish strength. The stock is trading above both short- and long-term moving averages, reflecting strong relative strength. The short-term outlook remains positive. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 176, Rs 182 Stop-Loss: Rs 153 Rashtriya Chemicals & Fertilizers | CMP: Rs 157.18 RCF has broken out above a descending triangle pattern with notable volume expansion, signaling strong bullish momentum. The stock is trading above its short- and long-term moving averages, confirming the uptrend. Momentum indicators support further upside, with the RSI moving above 50 and the MACD trending upward from its centerline. A decisive break above Rs 160 could drive the stock toward targets of Rs 168 and Rs 173. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 168, Rs 173 Stop-Loss: Rs 149 Swan Energy | CMP: Rs 509.75 Swan Energy broke out from a prolonged consolidation phase on July 15, backed by strong volumes. The stock is now consolidating in a tight range above the 200-day EMA, indicating a temporary pause in bullish momentum. Strong relative strength and momentum indicators suggest continued bullishness in the near term. The price action is forming a flag-and-pole pattern, and a breakout above Rs 526 could trigger renewed bullish momentum, with targets at Rs 590 and Rs 610. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 590, Rs 610 Stop-Loss: Rs 459 Hardik Matalia, Derivative Analyst at Choice Broking Jindal Steel & Power | CMP: Rs 1,000.45 Jindal Steel & Power has shown a strong technical breakout. The stock has recently completed the formation of a classic Inverted Head & Shoulders pattern—a bullish reversal formation that typically signals the end of a downtrend and the beginning of an uptrend. The neckline resistance above Rs 980 has been breached, supported by rising volumes and strong momentum. The stock is trading well above all standard EMAs, indicating strong momentum. A follow-through action above Rs 1,000 would confirm the trend extension. Momentum oscillators like RSI and MACD are likely in bullish zones, given the sharp rally and volume behaviour. Price is riding the upper Bollinger Band, reflecting strong trend intensity and the characteristics of a sustained uptrend. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,090 Stop-Loss: Rs 960 Lupin | CMP: Rs 1,941.4 Lupin has delivered a decisive move on the technical chart, breaking out from a falling trendline—indicating a potential reversal from its recent downtrend. The breakout zone, stemming from the January 2025 highs, had consistently acted as resistance. Thursday’s breakout above this trendline signals a shift in sentiment. This development marks a significant technical turning point after months of consolidation and downward pressure. The current price has crossed above the 20 EMA and is now approaching the 100 EMA resistance zone. Sustaining above Rs 1,950–1,960 could trigger further bullish momentum. Volume expansion near the breakout zone typically supports the sustainability of the up move. Additionally, the recent formation of higher lows reflects base building and reduced selling pressure. On the downside, immediate support is located at Rs 1,900, while a stop-loss at Rs 1,870 (recent swing low) is recommended to manage risk. The RSI, currently at 50.03, is trending upward—indicating growing buying momentum. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,100 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,870 Shyam Metalics and Energy | CMP: Rs 951.9 Shyam Metalics has confirmed a Cup and Handle pattern breakout on the daily chart. The breakout above the neckline zone of Rs 940–945 came after a well-rounded cup formation followed by a short-term consolidation handle. The stock is trading well above all key EMAs, reflecting strong bullish sentiment and overall trend alignment. Earlier this month, the 20-EMA crossover above the 50-EMA signaled a strengthening trend. In recent weeks, the stock had moved sideways with a mild downward drift—perfectly forming the handle part of the pattern. The breakout above Rs 945 confirms the bullish continuation, with potential for new highs. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,030 Stop-Loss: Rs 915 Om Mehra, Technical Research Analyst at Samco Securities Dixon Technologies | CMP: Rs 16,768 Dixon Technologies has continued its strong upward momentum, registering a breakout from a flag pattern formation—a classic bullish continuation pattern that follows a steep rally. The stock has resumed its uptrend, supported by above-average volume, confirming strength behind the move. Dixon is trading comfortably above all key moving averages. The clean separation from short-term EMAs highlights its strong bullish undertone. The RSI remains at 70, maintaining a rising slope with no sign of reversal. The MACD shows a strong bullish crossover, with the signal lines trending higher, indicating continued upside momentum. A falling flag breakout has occurred just below recent highs, and the breakout candle has held above the previous resistance. The weekly chart also remains bullish. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 17,700 Stop-Loss: Rs 16,250 REC | CMP: Rs 404.9 REC is breaking out from a short-term ascending triangle pattern on the daily chart. The stock has crossed above the Rs 400 mark, a key resistance level in recent sessions. The breakout occurred with increased volume, suggesting building bullish momentum. The price is now trading above both the 20-day and 50-day moving averages, signaling a strengthening short-term trend. The upward-sloping trendline from the Rs 394 zone has provided solid support during the recent consolidation. The RSI has improved to 56, rising above the neutral 50 mark and showing positive momentum. The slope remains upward, validating the strength behind the breakout. The hourly Supertrend could act as support in case of short-term pullbacks. The Rs 400 level, now a former resistance, has turned into immediate support.

The deal, which eliminates tariffs on most finished pharmaceutical products and medical devices, is expected to boost India’s exports to the UK valued at over $914 million grew 18% year-on-year (YoY) in FY24 . Imports from UK stood at $430.15 million with a YoY growth of 13%, according Exim data. Drug formulations and biologicals 84.7% share share of total Indian exports to UK. India exported medical devices worth Rs 1,015.02 crore to UK in FY24, which grew year-on-year (YoY) at 13.11%, while import from UK grew even impressive at 36.45% (YoY) to ₹2,295.37 crore in the same period. India medical device exports to UK were contact lens, diagnostic reagents, surgical instruments and PPE kits; major imports were Oxygen therapy equipment like ventilators, X-Ray equipment, diagnostic testing reagents and IVD analysis instruments. Currently UK charges zero duties on Indian pharmaceutical imports, while India levies a 10% basic customs duty on pharmaceuticals, with exemptions for certain life-saving drugs. For medical devices, custom duties by India range from 0% to 7.5%, depending on the category. Broadly, the UK will remove duties on 99% of Indian exports, while India will cut tariffs on 90% of UK products, aiming to increase annual bilateral trade by USD 34 billion. Pharma to benefit With major Indian pharma firms like Dr. Reddy’s, Sun Pharma, Cipla, Torrent Pharma, Intas, and Biocon already entrenched in the UK market, the FTA is expected to deepen their footprint. The deal also aligns with India’s ambition to become a global hub for affordable healthcare and medtech innovation. ""The pharmaceutical industry welcomes the India-UK Free Trade Agreement,"" said Sudarshan Jain, Secretary General, Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance, the industry body that represents large homegrown pharmaceutical companies. ""This will open up trade and economic opportunities between the two countries. As per the indications, the pharma sector will have opportunities to supply affordable and quality assured medicine contributing to better patient care in the UK,"" Jain added. “This partnership paves the way for collaborations in bulk drug imports, CDMO, and joint research, empowering India’s competitive edge and promoting global partnerships,” said Namit Joshi, Chairman of Pharmexcil, the trade body on Department of Pharmaceutical, Ministry of Commerce. As regulatory harmonization progresses, the India-UK FTA could serve as a blueprint for similar agreements with other developed markets, reinforcing India’s role in global health supply chains, said Sanjaya Mariwala, Executive Chairman of OmniActive Health Technologies and President of Mumbai-based IMC Chamber of Commerce and Industry. “With regulatory barriers coming down, Indian healthcare companies will find it easier to operate in the UK, leading to more affordable services and better collaboration,” he said. Medical devices trade boost “The FTA will significantly enhance access to high-quality, affordable medical devices in the UK market,” said Himanshu Baid, Managing Director of Poly Medicure Ltd. “It opens new avenues for advanced technology collaborations and innovation.” “We sought recognition of Indian CDSCO regulatory approval to fast-track UK MHRA approvals,” added Rajiv Nath, Forum Coordinator at AiMeD. “This would address non-tariff barriers and help Indian exporters compete more effectively.” While the FTA removes tariff barriers, Indian medical device stakeholders have raised concerns over regulatory costs and the potential misuse of rules of origin. Industry leaders are urging strict monitoring to prevent third-country products from being routed through the UK.","The deal, which eliminates tariffs on most finished pharmaceutical products and medical devices, is expected to boost India’s exports to the UK valued at over $914 million grew 18% year-on-year (YoY) in FY24 .","The deal, which eliminates tariffs on most finished pharmaceutical products and medical devices, is expected to boost India’s exports to the UK valued at over $914 million grew 18% year-on-year (YoY) in FY24 .","Medical devices trade boost “The FTA will significantly enhance access to high-quality, affordable medical devices in the UK market,” said Himanshu Baid, Managing Director of Poly Medicure Ltd. “It opens new avenues for advanced technology collaborations and innovation.” “We sought recognition of Indian CDSCO regulatory approval to fast-track UK MHRA approvals,” added Rajiv Nath, Forum Coordinator at AiMeD.","Medical devices trade boost “The FTA will significantly enhance access to high-quality, affordable medical devices in the UK market,” said Himanshu Baid, Managing Director of Poly Medicure Ltd. “It opens new avenues for advanced technology collaborations and innovation.” “We sought recognition of Indian CDSCO regulatory approval to fast-track UK MHRA approvals,” added Rajiv Nath, Forum Coordinator at AiMeD."
Karur Vysya Bank announces its first bonus issue in 7 years: What it means for investors,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/karur-vysya-bank-announces-its-first-bonus-issue-in-7-years-what-it-means-for-investors-13320930.html,"Karur Vysya Bank on July 24 announced a bonus issue of shares in the ratio of 1:5 for its shareholders. This marks the first bonus issue announced by the private lender in nearly seven years. Eligible shareholders would receive one bonus share for every five shares of the company they own, as on record date. ""Issuance of Bonus equity shares in the proportion of 1 :5 i.e. 1 (one) equity share of face value Rs 2/- each for every 5 (five) fully paid-up equity share of Rs 2/- each held by the members of the Bank as on the Record Date, subject to the approval of the members of the Bank at the ensuing AGM and other statutory and regulatory approvals, if any,"" the private lender said in its exchange filing. Record date for bonus issue: Karur Vysya Bank has set August 26 as the record date to determine the eligibility of the shareholders set to receive the bonus issue. This means that bonus shares will be handed over to those shareholders who own shares of the company as on August 26. Karur Vysya Bank bonus issue history: If approved, this would mark the fourth bonus issue delivered by the company. Earlier in August 2018, the company handed over bonus shares in the ratio of 1:10 to its eligible shareholders. Prior to that, it delivered bonus issue in the ratio of 2:5 in 2010. It had announced its first bonus issue in the ratio of 1:1 in 2002. While the issue of bonus shares increases the total number of shares issued and owned, it does not change the market capitalization of the company. This increases the overall liquidity of the stock, and makes it more affordable for other investors to add to their portfolio, creating strong upside potential for the stock.

Average sales per store rose 1% YoY to INR62m (annually) in 1QFY26. Growth was broad-based, with on-premise sales growing 8% YoY and off-premise sales growing 4% YoY. Consumption trends remain stable, and WESTLIFE expects eating-out frequency to gradually pick up in FY26. This improvement is likely to be supported by lower inflation and government stimulus. That said, while performance remains strong in the West, the company’s focus on strengthening presence in the South will remain a key focus area.

Click to View More Outlook for July 25 Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The Nifty slipped lower as it faced stiff resistance around the 25,250–25,260 zone. On the hourly chart, the index fell back below the 50-EMA and closed below it. Overall, the index continues its range-bound movement, which may persist in the near term. On the downside, support remains intact at 24,900; a decisive break below this level could trigger a correction in the market. On the other hand, a sustained move above 25,260 may induce a fresh rally. Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities After showing a sustainable upmove on Wednesday, Nifty was not able to continue its upside momentum on Thursday and witnessed sharp weakness by 157 points. After opening with a positive note, the market slipped into declines in the early-mid part of the session. There was a minor recovery attempt in the mid to later part, but the market finally closed at the lows. A long bear candle was formed on the daily chart that has engulfed the small positive candle of previous session. Technically, this market action indicates formation of Bearish Engulfing type candle pattern. This is negative indication. The bearish chart pattern like lower tops and bottoms is intact and Thursday's swing high of 25246 could be a new lower top of the pattern. The immediate resistance of 25250 remains active and Nifty reversed down from near the hurdle on Thursday. The underlying trend of Nifty is still weak. Presence of strong overhead resistance and the formation of bearish pattern indicates chances of more weakness in the short term. A slide below 24900 levels could possibly open some more weakness down to 24500 levels in the near term. Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities: Today, the benchmark indices experienced profit booking at higher levels. The Nifty closed 158 points lower, while the Sensex was down by 542 points. Among sectors, the IT index lost the most, correcting 2.20 percent, whereas despite weak market sentiment, the PSU Bank index rallied over 1.40 percent. Technically, the market once again faced resistance near 25,250/82,800 and reversed sharply. On daily charts, a bearish candle has formed, and on intraday charts, a lower top formation is evident, which is largely negative. We are of the view that, although the intraday market texture appears weak, a fresh selloff is possible only after the levels of 25,000/82,000 are breached. Below these levels, the market could retest 24,900-24,835 / 81,700-81,500. Conversely, if the market moves above 25,125/83,200, a technical bounce back to 25,250/82,800 could occur. Further upside may continue, potentially lifting the market to 25,325/83,000.

In the CB segment, volumes grew 3% sequentially, though realization remained flat. EBITDA/t stood at Rs17,791, stable QoQ, but lower YoY, primarily due to pricing pressure from increased dumping by Russian players in the domestic market. Going forward, realization is expected to remain largely stable. Power segment delivered strong performance, aided by higher realization and increased external sales. Aquapharm posted 7% YoY growth in topline, supported by 9% volume growth. However, EBITDAM declined by 220bps YoY due to elevated operating costs. For FY26/FY27, we expect CB volumes to grow by 8%/11%, driven by new capacity additions.

Cargo volumes were affected by lower iron ore volumes at Paradip, Dolvi steel plant maintenance shutdowns, and lower third-party cargo, despite strong coal handling operations at Ennore, PNP and Paradip. Volumes at its largest port, Jaigarh, remained tepid due to the delay in government orders to Jul’25. Port ops revenue per ton grew 2.8% YoY to Rs369 driven by tariff hikes during the quarter. We expect the ramp-up of group steel business in H2 and commissioning of the LPG terminal at JNPT to drive volume growth for the company.

The BFS strength continued through this quarter as well, the mega deal within the segment further validates the healthy momentum in the vertical. The pockets outside BFS also reported positive growth, however the outlook remains weak on account of tariff uncertainties and geo-political tension. Despite the quarterly outperformance, the management is building caution around client sentiment and limited discretionary spends. The revised FY26 revenue growth guidance (1-3% CC YoY) translates to a revenue CQGR of ~-0.3%-1.0% CC. We believe, the revenue cannibalization through Enterprise AI and Agentic AI has been instrumental and supporting the client-centricity to drive efficiency and productivity. Additionally, the company’s wider spectrum of offering supports active participation in vendor consolidation opportunities. On margins, the company executed well at the gross level (+70bpq QoQ) despite the compensation revision in Q1. However, the continued investments in fueling S&M engine created pressure at the EBIT level (-20bps QoQ). We expect the lower proportion of passthrough will be margin supportive, however H2 weakness and deal ramp up would provide lesser room for improvement.

The momentum within BFSI and Hi-Tech continued, while Healthcare growth decelerated further and reported a decline of 1.9%. The delayed ramp up and right-shifting of resources have led to the decline in Healthcare vertical. The management expects Healthcare to rejoin steady state and report growth for the rest of the year. The outlook for Hi-Tech and BFSI remains strong, attributed to the robust deal pipeline and improved growth profile. Although the NN deal TCV looks weak (+8.4% QoQ) in Q1, the large deal pipeline and executable order book remain healthy. We believe the company’s growth profile outside the top healthcare account remains strong and should continue to balance the equation through other two pillars. On margins, with the right shifting of resources, the subcon can be optimized further, while peak in utilization provides limited scope of margin improvement.

Natco CEO says scouting for buyouts larger than Adcock to boost non-US revenue,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/natco-ceo-says-scouting-for-buyouts-larger-than-adcock-to-boost-non-us-revenue-13319512.html,"Natco Pharma is actively seeking another major acquisition to diversify its revenue away from the United States, enhancing its earnings stability, as underscored by its Rs 2,000 crore cash offer to acquire a 35.75% stake in South Africa's Adcock Ingram Holdings. In an investor call, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rajeev Nannapaneni said the company is looking at another transaction, potentially as large or even larger than the Adcock deal, to gain a wider geographical footprint and bring more stability to its core earnings. ""As a business, we want to diversify,"" Nannapaneni said. ""We're all looking to diversify and build a more robust portfolio so that you're not dependent on one particular market."" CEO Nannapaneni said future transactions will be judged on their ability to provide access to a new geography or add a portfolio of products that the company currently does not have. Nannapaneni said Natco will still have a surplus cash of approximately Rs 1,500 crore and future cash flows to fund possible M&A opportunities. Natco will spend Rs 2,000 crore to acquire Adcock's minority shareholders, a transaction that will be funded through internal accruals. Natco's strength has always been its R&D capabilities to make generic versions of complex pharma products, coupled with aggressive patent litigation bets; however, the company has struggled to build a sustainable revenue stream, which remained wobbly in the absence of exclusivity-related products from the US market, or due to high competition. Natco Pharma's consolidated revenue for FY25 was Rs 4,784 crore, with a net profit of Rs 1,883 crore. The company doesn't provide revenue breakdown for US, but it is expected to be around 80% in FY25, largely due to windfall from sales of generic anti-cancer drug Revlimid. The company has indicated that it would face steep price erosion and loss of exclusivity weighing of generic Revlimid on its earnings in FY26, along with headwinds like US pricing and potential tariffs on exports. The Adcock deal aids diversification by providing a strong front-end in a new emerging geography like South Africa. The primary synergy is expected in Adcock's prescription business, which faces intense competition, largely from Indian firms. Natco plans to leverage its R&D and backward integration capabilities to support this segment. ""You need a partnership with somebody like us who can help you out,"" Nannapaneni said on the rationale. Adcock's presence is currently concentrated in South Africa and neighboring countries and Natco is exploring to expand the reach to more countries in Africa. He added that products from Natco's pipeline, citing Semaglutide as an example, could be sold through the new asset. While immediate earnings accretion is expected from the consolidation of numbers and monetization of existing filings, Nannapaneni advised that the 'real value' of the transaction will become apparent in the next two to three years as new products are filed, approved and launched in the South African market. Natco is taking Adcock private and believes the significant premium paid is fair to attract shareholders to tender shares. The company expects to delist Adcock in the next three to four months. Natco will hold one-third of the board seats, and while a controlling stake was not available at this time, Natco has secured a first-right of refusal for any future sale. Nannapaneni justified proceeding with the minority stake and said, ""an asset like this, you won't get every day"" and that building a similar business from scratch was ""simply not possible"".","Natco Pharma is actively seeking another major acquisition to diversify its revenue away from the United States, enhancing its earnings stability, as underscored by its Rs 2,000 crore cash offer to acquire a 35.75% stake in South Africa's Adcock Ingram Holdings.","Natco Pharma is actively seeking another major acquisition to diversify its revenue away from the United States, enhancing its earnings stability, as underscored by its Rs 2,000 crore cash offer to acquire a 35.75% stake in South Africa's Adcock Ingram Holdings.","""We're all looking to diversify and build a more robust portfolio so that you're not dependent on one particular market.""","While immediate earnings accretion is expected from the consolidation of numbers and monetization of existing filings, Nannapaneni advised that the 'real value' of the transaction will become apparent in the next two to three years as new products are filed, approved and launched in the South African market."

Nestle shares fall 5% to emerge as top Nifty loser as Q1 net profit misses estimates,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/nestle-shares-fall-5-to-emerge-as-top-nifty-loser-as-q1-net-profit-misses-estimates-13319260.html,"The shares of Nestle India crashed nearly 5 percent on July 24 after the company's Q1 net profit missed analysts' expectations. The stock is currently the top loser on the benchmark Nifty 50 index. Nestle reported a net profit of Rs 647 crore for the first quarter of the financial year 2026. This marks a 13% drop from the Rs 747 crore net profit reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year. The net profit is significantly lower than the Rs 751 crore estimated on an average by brokerages polled by Moneycontrol. The shares of the company were trading at 2,340 in the afternoon. The sharp fall in the share price pushed the Nifty FMCG index down more than 1 percent to hover around 55,143. Revenue from operations beats estimate The FMCG major's revenue from operations rose 6 percent on-year to Rs 5,096 crore in Q1 FY26. It had earlier reported revenue from operations at Rs 4,814 crore in Q1 FY25. The revenue is higher than the Rs 5,082 crore estimated on an average by brokerages polled by Moneycontrol. During the quarter under review, Nestle's income from domestic sales rose over 5 percent on-year to Rs 4,860 crore, while exports rose nearly 16 percent to Rs 214 crore. Its total sales grew more than 6 percent on-year to Rs 5,074 crore in Q1 FY26. 'Elevated consumption prices impacted earnings' Elevated consumption prices across the commodity portfolio impacted the FMCG company's earnings this quarter, said the firm's current Chairman and MD Suresh Narayanan. Higher operations costs as a result of significant expansion in manufacturing in the last seven to eight months, and higher finance costs due to borrowing from commercial banks to fund temporary operational cash-flow requirements further impacted earnings, he added. Suresh Narayanan however added that the firm has noticed stabilizing prices for edible oil and cocoa, a declining trend in coffee and stabilizing to modest increase in pricing of milk. ""The Powdered and Liquid Beverages category sustained its position as one of the largest growthdrivers with another robust performance this quarter registering strong double-digit growth. This performance builds on a strong foundation following high double-digit growth in the corresponding quarter. NESCAFÉ further solidified its leadership in the coffee category by gaining additional market share. The brand continued to democratize coffee through affordable packs, while also expanding the premium segment with NESCAFÉ Gold and NESCAFÉ Roastery. NESCAFÉ RTD continued to demonstrate strong growth,"" he said. The firm saw mixed growth performance in milk products and nutrition category, with certain segments showing growth while a few had muted performance. ""Significant rise in demand over recent quarters has led to growth in urban markets. RUrban markets too have demonstrated positive growth, signalling a favourable shift in market dynamics and contributing to overall market resilience,"" the firm's CMD said. 'Coffee prices expected to remain range-bound, Milk prices likely to fall' According to Nestle, coffee prices expected to remain range-bound at current lower levels, as the upcoming Vietnam crop appears to be normal. Cocoa and edible oil prices have stabilized and remain range-bound, while milk prices will likely decrease with the onset of a favorable monsoon and flush season, the firm added. Manish Tiwary appointed as Nestle India CMD Along with the Q1 results, the FMCG major’s board also approved the appointment of Manish Tiwary as the Chairman and Managing Director, effective from August 1 August this year. Current CMD Suresh Narayanan will relinquish his office upon his retirement on July 31.

With much gratitude, it has truly been an honour and privilege to serve you. I carry with me cherished memories of the decade gone by.

While global trade has taken a hit this year and economic growth is expected to remain subdued at around 2.8 percent, equity markets are beginning to price in a recovery in trade and growth by 2026. This optimism is contributing to the ongoing resilience and uptrend in global equities. In the US, strong corporate earnings are providing fundamental support to the market, V K Vijayakumar of Geojit Investments Limited said. He added that, on the institutional front, foreign investors have turned consistent sellers in the cash market, even as they continue to participate actively in primary issuances. The primary driver of this selling pressure is India's high valuations, especially when compared to relatively more attractive pricing in other global markets.

Specialty steel maker Mukand's shares up over 10 percent after Rs 673 crore land sale,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/specialty-steel-maker-mukand-s-shares-up-over-10-percent-after-rs-673-crore-land-sale-13318746.html,"Super specialty steel manufacturer and Bajaj Group company Mukand announced the sale of 17.77 acres of land in Thane district near Mumbai for close to Rs 673 crore, sending the share price sharply higher by over 10 percent in early trade on July 24. The move is aimed to unlock value by the company, and Mukand has received an advance of Rs 110 crore for the land deal. In the past, Mukand has used proceeds from non-core asset sale to pare down debt. ""...the Company has executed an Agreement for Sale on July 23, 2025 for the sale of land parcels admeasuring approx. 17.77 acres together with 50% undivided right, title and interest in the access road admeasuring approximately 2.73 acres and for the grant of a perpetual non-exclusive right of way over a land parcel admeasuring 0.16 acres or thereabouts situated at Kalwe and Dighe, in Thane district for a consideration of not less than Rs 86,980 per sq. mt. aggregating to approx Rs 673 crore and has received an advance of Rs 110 crore from the purchaser,"" a company filing said. As of March 2025, Mukand's adjusted net debt stood at Rs 1,537.85 crore with a net debt to equity at 1.60x. Adjusted net debt is defined as total liabilities, comprising interest-bearing loans and borrowings less cash and cash equivalents and current investments. The management has been focusing cost optimization to deepen presence in the specialty steel domain, particularly catering to the evolving demands of automotive, engineering, and oil & gas sectors. During FY25, Mukand clocked revenue from operations of Rs .4,911.16 crore, a modest decline of 5.08% compared to a year ago, which the management said was due to challenging market environment. In a volatile global backdrop of Russia–Ukraine conflict, supply chain disruptions in Middle East, and subdued steel demand in Europe, Mukand reported a net profit of Rs 86.95 crore for FY25. ""FY2024–25 presented significant challenges for the steel industry, with global headwinds stemming from geo-political tensions, supply chain disruptions, and dampened demand in key international markets. On the domestic front, the industry faced intense pressure due to a surge in low-priced steel imports and reduced exports, which weighed heavily on market dynamics and pricing,"" the company recent said. These external pressures have challenged Mukand's priority of operational efficiency and technological advancement. During FY25, one of Mukund's division secured its very first order from USA, a significant milestone in its global journey. Mukand plans to invest further in downstream value-added products to strengthen position and is prioritizing special steel for niche applications in aerospace, defense, power, and precision engineering. Over the last one year, Mukand's shares have fallen 11 percent, and are up 13 percent on a YTD basis.

KFC-operator Sapphire Foods shares also fell nearly 1 percent in morning trade, while Senores Pharma shares rallied over 12 percent. The companies had released their respective results on July 23. Bajaj Housing Finance Q1 Results: Bajaj Housing Finance on July 23 reported a net profit of Rs 583 crore for Q1 FY26. This marks a 21 percent on-year rise from the Rs 483 crore net profit reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year. However, the net profit fell marginally on a sequential basis from the Rs 587 crore reported in the previous quarter (Q4 FY25). The firm's revenue from operations rose 18 percent on-year and over 4 percent sequentially to Rs 2,616 crore during the quarter under review. Motilal Oswal Financial Services noted that the company's management has cut its FY26 AUM guidance to 21-23 percent, due to heightened competitive intensity on the acquisition of new loans, increased portfolio attrition, coupled with moderation in real estate demand. The company's management also said that net interest margin will decline by 15-20 bps in FY26 due to a reduction in investment income (which in FY25 was higher due to two rounds of capital raises) and lower income on derecognized loans due to the lower quantum of assignments planned in FY26, the domestic brokerage said. The shares of the company were down nearly 1 percent to trade at Rs 121 apiece. The stock has gained over 11 percent in the past six months, but is down nearly 5 percent in 2025 so far. It fell around 27 percent in the past one year. Sapphire Foods Q1 Results: KFC and Pizza Hut-operator Sapphire Foods reported a net loss of Rs 1.8 crore in Q1 FY26. This marks a significant decline from the Rs 8.5 crore net profit reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year. The firm's revenue from operations meanwhile rose 8 percent on year to Rs 777 crore. In Q1 FY26, Sapphire Foods added 8 KFC restaurants and 2 Pizza Hut outlets in India, and 1 Pizza Hut in Sri Lanka. Sapphire Foods total restaurant count stood at 974 at the end of the quarter. EBITDA declined nearly 9 percent on-year to Rs 113.4 crore, and EBITDA margin fell to 14.6 percent. JM Financial kept a 'Buy' call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 360 apiece. This implies an upside potential of nearly 5 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. ""Sapphire's revenue growth was tepid at 8% YoY (4% miss) led by 11%/19% growth (4%/10% miss) in KFC/Sri Lanka businesses, while Pizza Hut (PH) business registered decline of 6% YoY (10% miss). SSSG for KFC was flat YoY with low single digit positive SSTG after several quarters led by higher value offerings ... Demand recovery holds the key for the management’s initiatives to bear fruit; we believe we are now near the bottom of the earning cuts cycle and could witness a sharp uptick in margin and profitability once the demand environment improves,"" the brokerage said. Motilal Oswal also maintained a 'Buy' rating on the stock, with a target price of Rs 400 apiece, implying an upside potential of nearly 16 percent from the current levels. ""The company continues to face challenges in unit economics, with dine-in seeing more pressure than delivery. To drive recovery, the focus remains on product innovation, enhancing customer engagement, and strengthening value-led offerings. However, improvement in ADS and SSSG will be key monitorables, as they are essential for restoring unit-level profitability. The store expansion spree is expected to slow down in FY26 (mainly in PH) to fix profitability metrics,"" the domestic brokerage said. Sapphire Foods shares dropped nearly 1 percent to trade at Rs 341 apiece. The stock has dropped nearly 7 percent in the past five days, but gained nearly 5 percent in the past one month. The shares of the company have gained nearly 12 percent in the past six months. Senores Pharma Q1 Results: Senores Pharma reported a net profit of Rs 19.73 crore for the first quarter of the financial year 2026. This marks a whopping 84 percent on-year surge from the Rs 10.73 crore net profit reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year.

This marks a 15 percent on-year jump from the Rs 290 crore net profit reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year. Nomura and Morgan Stanley remain bullish on the stock. Technical view Yesterday's close underscores the importance of the 24,900–25,000 support zone in shaping the next directional move. The area between 25,200–25,320 has consistently acted as a stiff resistance cluster throughout the month, with the index now hovering near a key swing high. However, as long as the index maintains levels above 24,800, the probability of buying interest emerging on dips remains favorable. A decisive close above 25,250 would be instrumental in negating the existing bearish undertone and reviving broader bullish sentiment.

Here's how a major Mexican tomato exporter is affected by Trump’s 17% tariff,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/heres-how-a-major-mexican-tomato-exporter-is-affected-by-trumps-17-tariff-2025-07-26/,"AJUCHITLAN, Mexico (AP) — The Trump administration’s decision to impose a 17% duty on fresh tomatoes imported from Mexico has created a dilemma for the country providing more tomatoes to U.S. consumers than any other. The import tax that began July 14 is just the latest protectionist move by an administration that has threatened dozens of countries with tariffs, including its critical trading partner Mexico. It comes as the Mexican government tries to also negotiate its way out of a 30% general tariff scheduled to take effect Aug. 1. While the impacts of the tomato tariff are still in their infancy, a major grower and exporter in central Mexico shows how a tariff targeting a single product can destabilize the sector. Green tomato plants stretch upward row after row in sprawling high-tech greenhouses covering nearly six acres in the central state of Queretaro, among the top 10 tomato producing states in Mexico. Climate controlled and pest free, Veggie Prime’s greenhouses in Ajuchitlan send some 100 tons of fresh tomatoes every week to Mastronardi Produce. The Canadian company is the leading distributor of fresh tomatoes in the U.S. with clients that include Costco and Walmart. Moisés Atri, Veggie Prime’s export director, says they’ve been exporting tomatoes to the U.S. for 13 years and their substantial investment and the cost to produce their tomatoes won’t allow them to make any immediate changes. They’re also contractually obligated to sell everything they produce to Mastronardi until 2026. “None of us (producers) can afford it,"" Atri said. ""We have to approach our client to adjust the prices because we’re nowhere near making that kind of profit.” In the tariff’s first week, Veggie Prime ate the entire charge. In the second, its share of the new cost lowered when its client agreed to increase the price of their tomatoes by 10%. The 56-year-old Atri hopes that Mastronardi will eventually pass all of the tariff’s cost onto its retail clients. Experts say the tariff could cause a 5% to 10% drop in tomato exports, which last year amounted to more than $3 billion for Mexico. The Mexican Association of Tomato Producers says the industry generates some 500,000 jobs. Juan Carlos Anaya, director general of the consulting firm Grupo Consultor de Mercados Agrícolas, said a drop in tomato exports, which last year amounted to more than 2 billion tons, could lead to the loss of some 200,000 jobs When the Trump administration announced the tariff, the Commerce Department justified it as a measure to protect U.S. producers from artificially cheap Mexican imports. California and Florida growers that produce about 11 million tons would stand to benefit most, though most of that production is for processed tomatoes. Experts believe the U.S. would find it difficult to replace Mexico’s fresh tomato imports. Atri and other producers are waiting for a scheduled review of the measure in two months, when the U.S. heads into fall and fresh tomato production there begins to decline. In reaction to the tariff, the Mexican government has floated the idea of looking for other, more stable, international markets. Mexican Agriculture Secretary Julio Berdegué said Thursday that the government is looking at possibilities like Japan, but producers quickly cast doubt on that idea, noting the tomatoes would have to be sent by plane, raising the cost even more. Atri said the company is starting to experiment with peppers, to see if they would provide an option at scale. President Claudia Sheinbaum said recently her administration would survey tomato growers to figure out what support they need, especially small producers who are already feeling the effects of a drop of more than 10% in the price of tomatoes domestically over fears there will be a glut in Mexico.

Trump's meeting with a key European official comes as his tariff deadline nears,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trumps-meeting-with-a-key-european-official-comes-as-his-tariff-deadline-nears-2025-07-26/,"EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) — Donald Trump is meeting Sunday with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, taking a break from golfing in Scotland to discuss trade as both sides seek an agreement on tariff rates now that the White House's deadline to impose stiff tariff rates is looming. Trump played golf Saturday at his course in Turnberry on the southwest coast of Scotland and is expected to hit the links again frequently during his five-day visit. On Tuesday, he'll be in Aberdeen, in northeast Scotland, where his family has another golf course and is opening a third next month. Trump and his son Eric are planning to help cut the ribbon on the new course, where public tee times starting Aug. 13 are already on offer. The visit with von der Leyen is expected to be behind closed doors and few further details have been released. Leaving the White House on Friday, Trump said “we have a 50-50 chance, maybe less than that, but a 50-50 chance of making a deal with the EU.” He said the deal would have to “buy down” the currently scheduled tariff rate of 30% on the bloc of 27 member states. Later, von der Leyen posted on X that, “Following a good call” with Trump, the pair had ”agreed to meet in Scotland on Sunday to discuss transatlantic trade relations, and how we can keep them strong.” The U.S. and EU seemed close to reaching a deal earlier this month, but Trump instead threatened a 30% tariff rate on the bloc of nations. Still, Trump’s original deadline for beginning such tariffs has already passed, and is now delayed until at least Friday. Flying to Scotland to enjoy his golf courses hasn't stopped the president from talking trade. After going to Turnberry to play nine holes, have lunch, then play nine more, Trump posted that he'd block any trade deals between the U.S. and Cambodia and Thailand since the two southeast Asian countries remain locked in violent clashes in long-disputed border areas. Trump wrote that he spoke with Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet and Phumtham Wechayachai, the acting prime minister of Thailand, to call for a ceasefire. “I am trying to simplify a complex situation!” he wrote on Truth Social after disclosing his conversation with the Cambodian leader. After speaking with Wechayachai, Trump said both countries want peace and added: “Ceasefire, Peace, and Prosperity seems to be a natural.” The actual likelihood of a deal with the EU, meanwhile, remains to be seen. Trump recently said he thought the odds of reaching a framework with Japan was 25% — but the U.S. and Japan subsequently announced an agreement this past week. The president also bragged earlier in his term that he would leverage constant threats of steep U.S. tariffs around the globe to negotiate better rates and shrink trade deficits with some of Washington's key allies. But, so far, that effort has fallen well short of expectations, meaning the onus may be on Trump to be able to announce an agreement with a bloc as key to global commerce as the EU. Trump is also set to meet Monday in Scotland with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, after the two announced a trade framework in May and a larger agreement last month during the G7 in Canada. Trump says that deal is concluded and that the pair will discuss other matters — though the White House has suggested it still needs some polishing. Without an EU deal, the bloc said it was prepared to retaliate with tariffs on hundreds of American products, ranging from beef and auto parts to beer and Boeing airplanes. If Trump follows through on his threat of tariffs against Europe, it could make everything from French cheese and Italian leather goods to German electronics and Spanish pharmaceuticals more expensive in the U.S. Before you consider Boeing, you'll want to hear this.","Trump is also set to meet Monday in Scotland with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, after the two announced a trade framework in May and a larger agreement last month during the G7 in Canada.","Later, von der Leyen posted on X that, “Following a good call” with Trump, the pair had ”agreed to meet in Scotland on Sunday to discuss transatlantic trade relations, and how we can keep them strong.” The U.S. and EU seemed close to reaching a deal earlier this month, but Trump instead threatened a 30% tariff rate on the bloc of nations.",“I am trying to simplify a complex situation!” he wrote on Truth Social after disclosing his conversation with the Cambodian leader.,"Later, von der Leyen posted on X that, “Following a good call” with Trump, the pair had ”agreed to meet in Scotland on Sunday to discuss transatlantic trade relations, and how we can keep them strong.” The U.S. and EU seemed close to reaching a deal earlier this month, but Trump instead threatened a 30% tariff rate on the bloc of nations."
Allianz Life confirms data breach affecting majority of 1.4M US customers,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/allianz-life-confirms-data-breach-affecting-majority-of-14m-us-customers-2025-07-26/,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Hackers gained access to personal data on the majority of the 1.4 million customers of Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America, the company confirmed Saturday. Minneapolis-based Allianz Life, a subsidiary of Munich, Germany-based Allianz SE, said the data breach happened on July 16 when a “malicious threat actor” gained access to a third-party, cloud-based system used by the company. “The threat actor was able to obtain personally identifiable data related to the majority of Allianz Life’s customers, financial professionals, and select Allianz Life employees, using a social engineering technique,” Allianz Life said in a statement. ""We took immediate action to contain and mitigate the issue and notified the FBI."" The company said its own systems were not accessed, just the third-party's platform. Allianz Life said its investigation is ongoing and that the company has begun reaching out to the impacted individuals. It said the incident involves only Allianz Life in the U.S., not other Allianz corporate entities. In the case of data breaches, a “social engineering technique” usually involves using trickery to gain access. Spokesman Brett Weinberg said he couldn't provide details because they are still investigating. Allianz Life also reported the breach to multiple other authorities, including the Maine Attorney General's Office. A filing on the agency's website said the company discovered the breach the day after it happened, and that it will be offering those affected 24 months of identity theft protection and credit monitoring. Allianz Life was known as North American Life and Casualty until it was acquired by German conglomerate Allianz SE in 1979 and changed its name to Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America. It has nearly 2,000 employees in U.S., with the majority working in Minnesota, according to its website. It is one of five North American subsidiaries of the Munich-based global financial services group Allianz SE, which says it serves more than 125 million customers worldwide.","“The threat actor was able to obtain personally identifiable data related to the majority of Allianz Life’s customers, financial professionals, and select Allianz Life employees, using a social engineering technique,” Allianz Life said in a statement.","“The threat actor was able to obtain personally identifiable data related to the majority of Allianz Life’s customers, financial professionals, and select Allianz Life employees, using a social engineering technique,” Allianz Life said in a statement.","In the case of data breaches, a “social engineering technique” usually involves using trickery to gain access.","“The threat actor was able to obtain personally identifiable data related to the majority of Allianz Life’s customers, financial professionals, and select Allianz Life employees, using a social engineering technique,” Allianz Life said in a statement."
The Tea app was intended to help women date safely. Then it got hacked,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/the-tea-app-was-intended-to-help-women-date-safely-then-it-got-hacked-2025-07-26/,"Tea, a provocative dating app designed to let women anonymously ask or warn each other about men they'd encountered, rocketed to the top spot on the U.S. Apple App Store this week. On Friday, the company behind the app confirmed it had been hacked: Thousands of images, including selfies, were leaked online. “We have engaged third-party cybersecurity experts and are working around the clock to secure our systems,” San Francisco-based Tea Dating Advice Inc. said in a statement. 404 Media, which earlier reported the breach, said it was 4Chan users who discovered an exposed database that “allowed anyone to access the material” from Tea. The app and the breach highlight the fraught nature of seeking romance in the age of social media. Here's what to know: Tea founder Sean Cook, a software engineer who previously worked at Salesforce and Shutterfly, says on the app's website that he founded the company in 2022 after witnessing his own mother's “terrifying'' experiences. Cook said they included unknowingly dating men with criminal records and being ”catfished'' — deceived by men using false identities. Tea markets itself as a safe way for women to anonymously vet men they might meet on dating apps such as Tinder or Bumble — ensuring that the men are who they say they are, not criminals and not already married or in a relationship. ""It's like people have their own little Yelp pages,'' said Aaron Minc, whose Cleveland firm, Minc Law, specializes in cases involving online defamation and harassment. In an Apple Store review, one woman wrote that she used a Tea search to investigate a man she'd begun talking to and discovered “over 20 red flags, including serious allegations like assault and recording women without their consent.'' She said she cut off communication. ”I can't imagine how things could've gone had I not known,"" she wrote. A surge in social media attention over the past week pushed Tea to the No. 1 spot on Apple's U.S. App Store as of July 24, according to Sensor Tower, a research firm. In the seven days from July 17-23, Tea downloads shot up 525% compared to the week before. Tea said in an Instagram post that it had reached 4 million users. A female columnist for The Times of London newspaper, who signed into the app, on Thursday called Tea a “man-shaming site'' and complained that ”this is simply vigilante justice, entirely reliant on the scruples of anonymous women. With Tea on the scene, what man would ever dare date a woman again?'' “Over the last couple of weeks, we’ve gotten hundreds of calls on it. It’s blown up,” attorney Minc said. ""People are upset. They're getting named. They’re getting shamed.’’ In 1996, Congress passed legislation protecting websites and apps from liability for things posted by their users. But the users can be sued for spreading ”false and defamatory'' information, Minc said. In May, however, a federal judge in Illinois threw out an invasion-of-privacy lawsuit by a man who’d been criticized by women in the Facebook chat group “Are We Dating the Same Guy,″ Bloomberg Law reported. State privacy laws could offer another avenue for bringing legal action against someone who posted your photograph or other personal information in a harmful way, Minc said. In its statement, Tea reported that about 72,000 images were leaked online, including 13,000 images of selfies or photo identification that users submitted during account verification. Another 59,000 images that were publicly viewable in the app from posts, comments and direct messages were also accessed, according to the company's statement. No email addresses or phone numbers were exposed, the company said, and the breach only affects users who signed up before February 2024. “At this time, there is no evidence to suggest that additional user data was affected. Protecting tea users’ privacy and data is our highest priority,” Tea said. It said users did not need to change their passwords or delete their accounts. ""All data has been secured.'' Lawyer Minc said he was not surprised to see Tea get targeted. “These sites get attacked,'' he said. ”They create enemies. They put targets on themselves where people want to go after them.'' .","Tea markets itself as a safe way for women to anonymously vet men they might meet on dating apps such as Tinder or Bumble — ensuring that the men are who they say they are, not criminals and not already married or in a relationship.","Tea markets itself as a safe way for women to anonymously vet men they might meet on dating apps such as Tinder or Bumble — ensuring that the men are who they say they are, not criminals and not already married or in a relationship.","State privacy laws could offer another avenue for bringing legal action against someone who posted your photograph or other personal information in a harmful way, Minc said.","Tea markets itself as a safe way for women to anonymously vet men they might meet on dating apps such as Tinder or Bumble — ensuring that the men are who they say they are, not criminals and not already married or in a relationship."
"Comic-Con salutes James Gunn and gets first looks at 'Coyote vs. Acme,' and new 'Star Trek' forays",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/comic-con-goes-interstellar-with-project-hail-mary-star-trek-updates-2025-07-26/,"SAN DIEGO (AP) — Director James Gunn got an ovation from thousands for “Superman” in the most fitting place of all — Comic-Con. Among the highlights of day three of the San Diego pop culture spectacular was a sincere tribute to the director who's now helming Warner Bros.' DC Comics screen universe, even if John Cena played it for laughs. It came at a panel on the forthcoming Season 2 of DC's HBO series “The Peacemaker,” and Cena appeared in the title character's full comic costume and grand helmet, leading the legions in the kind of exaggerated drama he was perfect at provoking in his wrestling days. It was Gunn's first time in front of a crowd in the weeks since “Superman” was released and has earned more than $200 million in North America. “Today has been the most fun day I’ve had in a year,"" Gunn told the crowd at the end of the session. “Superman” was his first film as captain of the DC ship, but his first foray was in 2021's “The Suicide Squad,” which spawned the “Peacemaker” TV series. The crowd saw scenes from Season 2, which arrives in August and sees Cena entering another dimension where he gets to be a cool version of the hero instead of the often pained and pathetic version that's typical of the character. Some characters from “Superman” will make appearances. That panel followed another rousing showcase in Hall H, where star Ryan Gosling and directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller showed scenes from their forthcoming science-comedy space adventure “Project Hail Mary.” The scenes from the film set for release in March included a look at Rocky, a faceless, stone-shaped alien who becomes Gosling's unlikely partner in an attempt to save the universe from ecological disaster. Wile E. Coyote is getting his day in court — and theaters. The stars of “Coyote vs. Acme” delivered a rousing presentation Saturday morning of a movie that at one point wasn’t going to be released but is now bound for theaters in August 2026. The underdog story – both of the movie and Coyote — was a running theme of the panel. But rather than direct ire at Warner Bros., the real-world studio that shelved the project, the panel focused on the fictional Acme Corp. “This is purely an Acme decision … and I am saying this for legal purposes,” moderator Paul Scheer said at the start of the panel. The movie is a hybrid of animation and live action and is based on a 1990 New Yorker article that satirized a legal complaint filed by Coyote against Acme, the maker of the TNT, detonators, rocket shoes, catapults and other products that consistently backfire during the Coyote’s fruitless attempts to catch the Roadrunner. Laughter filled Hall H as some 6,000 watched a montage of Coyote being blown up, flattened and falling into chasms in a scene set to Johnny Cash’s cover of “Hurt.” Coyote is replaying the moments in his lair when an ad for a personal injury lawyer appears on TV. They also played six minutes of the movie, including a scene of opening statements in the case in which Coyote's lawyer, Will Forte, accidentally unleashes a rocket skate into the courtroom, setting Coyote and the judge's robes on fire. Cena plays a slick Acme lawyer who wins over the jury, which includes a cartoon character, quickly. Forte said he didn't think the movie would ever get to audiences. “I’m pretty speechless. You think back to the journey that this movie has taken. I had kind of given up hope at a certain point,” Forte said. At one point, his comments were interrupted by a man playing an Acme lawyer who stormed into Hall H with cease-and-desist letters. Director Dave Green said the movie conforms to famed animator Chuck Jones’ rules for the struggle between the Coyote and Roadrunner, which include the bird always staying on the road and the Coyote being ultimately more humiliated than hurt when he falls, is crushed or gets blown up by TNT. The movie, which features cameos from numerous Looney Tunes characters like Foghorn Leghorn, Tweety and Bugs Bunny, will be released on Aug. 28, 2026. Ketchup Entertainment teamed up with Warner Bros. on the film and in the release of “The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie.” Also on Saturday morning, the cast of “Bad Guys 2” teasing new footage from the movie and describing how they recorded their characters. Marc Maron, who plays Snake, joked he asked to be tied up as he performed his lines on the floor. “The depth of the character should read a little more this time,” he said. The film, based on the graphic novel series by Aaron Blabey, introduces a new crew of animal criminals, the Bad Girls played by Danielle Brooks, Natasha Lyonne and Maria Bakalova. Paramount showed off its first footage from a new series, “Starfleet Academy,” which stars Holly Hunter and Paul Giamatti. The show follows cadets as they go through training, with Hunter serving as chancellor of the academy. It will arrive in 2026, the 60th anniversary year of the original “Star Trek” series. Paramount+'s other “Star Trek” series, “Strange New Worlds,” also shared updates. The crew of the USS Enterprise are being turned into puppets for an upcoming “Strange New Worlds” episode, Paramount announced Saturday. The puppets will be created by Jim Henson's Creature Shop. Season 3, which follows the adventures of the Enterprise under the command of Capt. Christopher Pike, is being released on Paramount+. An estimated 135,000 people — many in costumes — are expected to attend Comic-Con 2025, which runs through Sunday in downtown San Diego. So far, fans have gotten previews of “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2,”the upcoming FX series “Alien: Earth” and “Predator: Badlands,” which will be in theaters in November.","The movie is a hybrid of animation and live action and is based on a 1990 New Yorker article that satirized a legal complaint filed by Coyote against Acme, the maker of the TNT, detonators, rocket shoes, catapults and other products that consistently backfire during the Coyote’s fruitless attempts to catch the Roadrunner.","Ketchup Entertainment teamed up with Warner Bros. on the film and in the release of “The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie.” Also on Saturday morning, the cast of “Bad Guys 2” teasing new footage from the movie and describing how they recorded their characters.","At one point, his comments were interrupted by a man playing an Acme lawyer who stormed into Hall H with cease-and-desist letters.","Ketchup Entertainment teamed up with Warner Bros. on the film and in the release of “The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie.” Also on Saturday morning, the cast of “Bad Guys 2” teasing new footage from the movie and describing how they recorded their characters."
Trump says Japan will invest $550 billion in US at his direction. It may not be a sure thing,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-says-japan-will-invest-550-billion-in-us-at-his-direction-it-may-not-be-a-sure-thing-2025-07-26/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is bragging that Japan has given him, as part of a new trade framework, $550 billion to invest in the United States. It's an astonishing figure, but still subject to negotiation and perhaps not the sure thing he's portraying. ""Japan is putting up $550 billion in order to lower their tariffs a little bit,"" Trump said Thursday. “They put up, as you could call it, seed money. Let’s call it seed money.” He said 90% of any profits from the money invested would go to the U.S. even if Japan had put up the funds. “It’s not a loan or anything, it’s a signing bonus,” the Republican president said, on the trade framework that lowered his threatened tariff from 25% to 15%, including on autos. A White House official said the terms are being negotiated and nothing has been formalized in writing. The official, who insisted on anonymity to detail the terms of the talks, suggested the goal was for the $550 billion fund to make investments at Trump's direction. The sum is significant: It would represent more than 10% of Japan's entire gross domestic product. The Japan External Trade Organization estimates that direct investment into the U.S. economy topped $780 billion in 2023. It is unclear the degree to which the $550 billion could represent new investment or flow into existing investment plans. What the trade framework announced Tuesday has achieved is a major talking point for the Trump administration. The president has claimed to have brought trillions of dollars in new investment into the U.S., though the impact of those commitments have yet to appear in the economic data for jobs, construction spending or manufacturing output. The framework also enabled Trump to say other countries are agreeing to have their goods taxed, even if some of the cost of those taxes are ultimately passed along to U.S. consumers. On the $550 billion, Japan's Cabinet Office said it involves the credit facility of state-affiliated financial institutions, such as Japan Bank for International Cooperation. Further details would be decided based on the progress of the investment deals. Japanese trade negotiator Ryosei Akazawa, upon returning to Japan, did not discuss the terms of the $550 billion investment. Akazawa said he believes a written joint statement is necessary, at least on working levels, to avoid differences. He is not thinking about a legally binding trade pact. The U.S. apparently released its version of the deal while Japanese officials were on their return flight home. “If we find differences of understanding, we may have to point them out and say ‘that’s not what we discussed,’” Akazawa said. The U.S. administration said the fund would be invested in critical minerals, pharmaceuticals, computer chips and shipbuilding, among other industries. It has said Japan will also buy 100 airplanes from Boeing and rice from U.S. farmers as part of the framework, which Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said would be evaluated every three months. “And if the president is unhappy, then they will boomerang back to the 25% tariff rates, both on cars and the rest of their products. And I can tell you that I think at 25, especially in cars, the Japanese economy doesn’t work,” Bessent told Fox News' “The Ingraham Angle.” Akazawa denied that Bessent’s quarterly review was part of the negotiations. “In my past eight trips to the United States during which I held talks with the president and the ministers,"" Akazawa said. “I have no recollection of discussing how we ensure the implementation of the latest agreement between Japan and the United States.” He said it would cause major disruptions to the economy and administrative processes if the rates first rise to 25% as scheduled on Aug. 1 and then drop to 15%. “We definitely want to avoid that and I believe that is the understanding shared by the U.S. side,” he said. On buying U.S. rice, Japanese officials have said they have no plans to raise the current 770,000-ton “minimum access” cap to import more from America. Agricultural Minister Shinjiro Koizumi said Japan will decide whether to increase U.S. rice imports and that Japan is not committed to a fixed quota. Trump's commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, has suggested that the Japanese agreement is putting pressure on other countries such as South Korea to strike deals with the U.S. Trump, who is traveling in Scotland, plans to meet on Sundayv with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to discuss trade. “Whatever Donald Trump wants to build, the Japanese will finance it for him,” Lutnick said Thursday on CNBC. “Pretty amazing.” ___ Yamaguchi reported from Tokyo.

"Modi joins Maldives independence day celebrations, signals easing tensions amid China rivalry",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/modi-joins-maldives-independence-day-celebrations-signals-easing-tensions-amid-china-rivalry-2025-07-26/,"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi Saturday participated Saturday in the 60th Independence Day celebrations of the Maldives, concluding a two-day visit to the island nation. During the trip, Modi also announced financial assistance and formally launched talks on a proposed free trade agreement. The two-day visit was seen as crucial to India’s ambition to control the seas and shipping routes of the Indian Ocean in a race with its regional rival China. It signaled a thaw in diplomatic tensions that followed the election of pro-China Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu in 2023. Modi joined a distinguished gathering at Republic Square in the capital, Malé, where a military parade and cultural performances marked the anniversary of the Maldives gaining independence from British rule in 1965. On Friday, following talks with Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu, Modi announced a credit line of $565 million to support development projects in the Maldives. The visit coincided with the anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between the two nations in 1965. It also saw the start of talks on a free trade agreement. The two leaders oversaw the exchange of signed agreements to cooperate in sectors such as fisheries, health, tourism and digital development. Modi also handed over dozens of heavy vehicles donated by India to strengthen the Maldives’ defense forces. The Maldives — an archipelago nation strategically located in the Indian Ocean — is a focal point in the growing geopolitical rivalry between India and China. Tensions grew when Muizzu, who favored closer ties with China, was elected in 2023 after defeating the India-friendly incumbent Ibrahim Mohamed Solih. Leading up to the election, Muizzu had promised to expel Indian soldiers deployed in the Maldives to help with humanitarian assistance. Last year New Delhi replaced dozens of its soldiers in the Maldives with civilian experts. Measures by Modi to promote tourism in India’s Lakshadweep archipelago, off the southwestern coast of the Indian mainland, also sparked anger from Maldivians, who saw it as a move to lure Indian tourists away from their country. Indian celebrities then called for a tourism boycott of the Maldives. Tensions escalated last year when President Muizzu visited China before India, a move widely interpreted in New Delhi as a diplomatic snub. On his return, Muizzu outlined plans to reduce the Maldives’ reliance on India for medical services, pharmaceuticals, and essential imports such as food staples. Relations started to improve after Muizzu attended Modi’s swearing-in ceremony for a third five-year term last year. Muizzu has since toned down his anti-Indian rhetoric, and official contacts with New Delhi have intensified amid growing concern about the Maldives’ economy. During a visit by Muizzu to India last October, India pledged financial support to the Maldives, which has been struggling with debt. This included $100 million in short-term government loans and agreeing to a $400 million currency swap to help stabilize the Maldivian economy. India has long been a key development partner for the Maldives. However, the island nation has also deepened ties with China, joining its Belt and Road Initiative in 2013 to build infrastructure and expand trade — part of Beijing’s broader effort to increase its global influence.","On Friday, following talks with Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu, Modi announced a credit line of $565 million to support development projects in the Maldives.","Measures by Modi to promote tourism in India’s Lakshadweep archipelago, off the southwestern coast of the Indian mainland, also sparked anger from Maldivians, who saw it as a move to lure Indian tourists away from their country.","On Friday, following talks with Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu, Modi announced a credit line of $565 million to support development projects in the Maldives.",The two-day visit was seen as crucial to India’s ambition to control the seas and shipping routes of the Indian Ocean in a race with its regional rival China.
Crypto Skeptics Can Still Win Big With These Risk-Limiting ETFs,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/crypto-skeptics-can-still-win-big-with-these-risk-limiting-etfs/,"Fresh off all-time highs above $120,000, Bitcoin has had an incredible run in the last year with a price increase above 80%. The potential for a more favorable regulatory environment may have helped drive these gains and could also inspire once-cautious investors to take the crypto plunge. Still, there are plenty of reasons to be hesitant about cryptocurrency—volatility, user and programming risks for various exchanges and platforms, and security concerns are all still present, among other things. Investors hesitant to make direct, unprotected cryptocurrency investments but interested in the recent rally might consider a risk-limiting crypto ETF. Besides providing some insulation from the cryptocurrency itself by allowing exposure indirectly through shares of a fund, these vehicles may combine a crypto focus with something more stable from the traditional investment landscape. Further, all of the funds below have significantly outperformed the S&P 500 year-to-date (YTD), showing that these risk-mitigating strategies can still pay off. The Fidelity Crypto Industry and Digital Payments ETF NASDAQ: FDIG has been one of the better-performing crypto-adjacent ETFs in recent quarters. FDIG does not invest in cryptocurrency or related futures but rather holds a basket of stocks from both the U.S. and international markets. While many of these companies are involved in the cryptocurrency space—think of crypto exchanges like Coinbase Global Inc. NASDAQ: COIN and digital asset miners like MARA Holdings Inc. NASDAQ: MARA—others are more broadly centered around digital payments or blockchain, providing some alternate exposure. FDIG is reasonably diversified, with around 52 separate holdings that are spaced across the small-, mid-, and large-cap categories. Coinbase is the single largest security holding, but most other names are fairly evenly weighted. FDIG may appeal for its passive income potential, as it provides a dividend yield of 0.95%. This may help make the expense ratio of 0.40% even more compelling, despite the fact that it's already lower than many other crypto funds. FDIG has returned about 24% YTD, ahead of the S&P 500's 8.7% over the same period. An Ethereum-focused fund, the Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF NYSEARCA: AETH, aims to minimize the impact of volatility by using U.S. Treasuries during volatile periods. AETH is an actively managed fund that pivots between two different approaches: when fund managers believe momentum is strong, AETH holds exclusively CME Ether Futures, and when the market becomes volatile or uncertain, AETH shifts entirely to U.S. Treasuries. The fund's provider, Bitwise, asserts that a rotational strategy like this can outperform buy-and-hold crypto funds by capturing gains achieved during ether rallies while limiting downside risk during turbulent times. AETH's recent performance would suggest that this is accurate; the fund has a YTD return of 32.6%, while a traditional competitor investing solely in ether futures like the ARK 21Shares Active Ethereum Futures Strategy ETF NYSEARCA: ARKZ has returned just 7.7% in the same period. Investors should expect to spend more in fees for the active management component of AETH, which charges an expense ratio of 0.89%. ARKZ, by contrast, is somewhat lower at 0.70%. However, the added security of a Treasuries component—and the improved performance—may make AETH worth the higher cost. The One+One Bitcoin and Ether ETF NASDAQ: OOQB is a unique type of leveraged investment that offers both 100% Nasdaq-100 exposure and 100% Bitcoin exposure via futures. As a leveraged play, investors may wish to focus on short-term trades of OOQB. This fund provides an interesting mix of risk and risk mitigation. On one hand, a 2x leverage such as this is inherently higher-risk than traditional, non-leveraged ETFs. However, by balancing out Bitcoin futures exposure, typically seen as higher risk than traditional index-based funds, with a group of stalwart performers like those from the Nasdaq-100, OOQB offers some protection relative to a pure-play Bitcoin investment. OOQB is one of the newest cryptocurrency ETFs available, having only launched in February 2025. As such, a YTD performance metric is unavailable for this fund. However, in the last three months, it has returned more than 50%, with a relatively modest expense ratio of 0.85%. Keep in mind, though, as above, that the fund may not be intended for buy-and-hold investors but rather for those seeking targeted short-term exposure to Bitcoin with some protection from synchronous Nasdaq-100 access. Before you consider Fidelity Crypto Industry and Digital Payments ETF, you'll want to hear this.","Keep in mind, though, as above, that the fund may not be intended for buy-and-hold investors but rather for those seeking targeted short-term exposure to Bitcoin with some protection from synchronous Nasdaq-100 access.","AETH's recent performance would suggest that this is accurate; the fund has a YTD return of 32.6%, while a traditional competitor investing solely in ether futures like the ARK 21Shares Active Ethereum Futures Strategy ETF NYSEARCA: ARKZ has returned just 7.7% in the same period.",FDIG does not invest in cryptocurrency or related futures but rather holds a basket of stocks from both the U.S. and international markets.,"AETH's recent performance would suggest that this is accurate; the fund has a YTD return of 32.6%, while a traditional competitor investing solely in ether futures like the ARK 21Shares Active Ethereum Futures Strategy ETF NYSEARCA: ARKZ has returned just 7.7% in the same period."
3 Discounted Steel Stocks You Can DCA Into Today,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/3-discounted-steel-stocks-you-can-dca-into-today/,"Most investors can agree that the industrial sector's current state is one of neglect, as most of the attention (and capital) has shifted to the more exciting stories in the artificial intelligence race in today’s market. This means that a potential rotation could be triggered in the future, no matter how vague this future may be. One of the best ways for investors to start exposing their portfolios to setups like these is to implement something called dollar-cost averaging (DCA). This means that investors will choose both a set date and amount to invest in a single name or a basket of names in an area like the industrial sector, which shows significant upside potential and a gap to fill. Of course, choosing the best names in this area can significantly improve the results of a DCA strategy, which is where names like Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. NYSE: CLF, Commercial Metals Co. NYSE: CMC, and even Steel Dynamics Inc. NASDAQ: STLD come into play. There are obvious reasons why investors should consider these stocks for their DCA basket, as they could offer the best of both safety and upside potential in the coming months. Considering the entire steel industry, all peers are trading at an average of 90% of their 52-week high prices. This is why Cleveland-Cliffs stock should be viewed as a potential catch-up play, as it is currently the outlier, trading at only 68% of its 52-week high. Next is the recently bullish view coming out of Wall Street, where Phillip Gibbs, an analyst from KeyCorp, decided to boost his rating on Cleveland-Cliffs stock from Sector Weight to Overweight. Not only did the sentiment improve for this stock, but its current perceived valuation also improved. This analyst decided to stand out of the pack and place a $14 per share price target on Cleveland-Cliffs stock, which, compared to today’s prices would mean not only flirting with 52-week high levels and closing that gap to peers, but also an approximate 40% upside potential for investors to expose their portfolios to in a DCA strategy. Another gauge to justify this view for Cleveland-Cliffs stock can be taken from what institutional buyers are doing with it. As of late July 2025, those from JB Capital decided to boost their holdings in the stock by 14.6% to net their position at $1.2 million. The fact that this isn’t the largest holding speaks to the current interest in slowly building a bigger position through DCA. Commercial Metals stock stands out due to its exposure to aluminum and steel production in the United States and China. This makes it an immediately valuable business opportunity that diversifies the ongoing risks and uncertainties stemming from the trade tariff negotiations between the two countries. Investors can expect big things from this fundamental setup, especially as Wall Street analysts now see the company reporting up to $1.25 in earnings per share (EPS) for the fourth quarter of 2025, in other words, a net increase of 70% from today’s reported $0.74 EPS. Now, most investors know that where EPS growth goes, so does the stock price, and this is why the entire market is now willing to pay up to 167.3x the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, a significant premium compared to the 109.3x average P/E for the materials sector today. Markets are often willing to overpay for names that they expect will outperform not only their peers but also the broader market. Commercial Metals stock's massive EPS growth and diversification between the United States and China justify a premium. As of mid-July 2025, Wall Street analysts seem to have figured out that Steel Dynamics stock is one of the clear winners in the steel industry. This might be why an analyst like Bill Peterson from J.P. Morgan Chase decided to boost his valuation target from $138 per share to a much higher $150 valuation. This new view implies that the stock could deliver up to 20% upside moves in the coming months and quarters, but like others, this one is also justified. Wall Street analysts also anticipate significant EPS growth in the coming quarters, with a target of $2.88 for the fourth quarter of 2025. Compared to today’s reported $2.01 in EPS, this suggests investors could be positioned for a 43% growth rate in earnings, which supports the double-digit upside potential seen in these valuation targets as well. This would make it another perfect candidate for starting a DCA strategy today for the coming quarters. Just as in the other names on this list, smart money has already started to apply this strategy, as those from Robeco Institutional Asset Management boosted their position in Steel Dynamics stock by 40.6% as of mid-July 2025 for a net holding of $214.5 million today, and another vote of confidence for this winner.

Could Baker Hughes Be an Unlikely Winner in Drone Defense Boom?,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/could-baker-hughes-be-an-unlikely-winner-in-drone-defense-boom/,"Baker Hughes NASDAQ: BKR won't be a name that comes to mind in the context of rising global defense budgets. However, the company’s recent earnings report shows why Baker Hughes may have an unrealized advantage as energy infrastructure, digital automation, and drone warfare become increasingly interconnected. Baker Hughes is best known as a provider of energy and oilfield services. That makes the company’s earnings and stock price sensitive to the price of oil and natural gas. A closer look at the company’s earnings report shows how it continues to transform itself into a technology-driven industrial player. Specifically, Baker Hughes is building adjacent capabilities in digital infrastructure, industrial AI, and process optimization. These are assets that could quietly align it with next-generation defense priorities. After the passage of the Trump administration’s “One Big, Beautiful Bill,” the U.S. defense budget for fiscal 2025 will exceed $900 billion. That dollar figure is impressive, but it’s where those dollars will be allocated that may be more significant to Baker Hughes. The U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) intends to make significant allocations toward unmanned systems (e.g., drones), energy resilience, and digital warfare. That has many investors looking to traditional defense contractors like Lockheed Martin Corp. NYSE: LMT and Northrop Grumman Corp. NYSE: NOC. However, to accomplish its objectives, the DOD will have to turn to industrial technology providers to source advanced capabilities in the energy space. This is where Baker Hughes may fit in. Like most energy stocks, Baker Hughes has had an “okay” year. BKR stock is up about 6.8% year-to-date. However, the stock jumped over 9.5% after its second quarter earnings report. A key factor was the company’s revenue of $6.8 billion, along with a 130-basis-point increase in operating margin. But what’s more revealing is where the growth is coming from. In short, Baker Hughes is not just about notoriously cyclical pumps and pipes. The company is pivoting into sensors, software, AI-driven diagnostics, and modular energy systems. It's important to emphasize that this isn’t happening today. However, there are reasons to believe Baker Hughes can fit into the Pentagon’s long-term plans. To understand this, it’s important to remember that drones are complex systems that require predictive maintenance, remote power systems, and AI-based monitoring and control systems. These are areas where Baker Hughes’ industrial tools could find crossover applications. For example: The company’s earnings presentation noted, “We continue to invest in technologies that support electrification and energy efficiency across industries.” Given that the U.S. Department of Defense increasingly awards contracts to tech-forward industrial partners, BKR could be on the shortlist for non-traditional support roles, especially in energy and logistics. From mid-June to mid-July, BKR stock formed an ascending triangle pattern. A breakout above resistance on strong earnings and volume confirms this bullish formation. With the sharp run-up after earnings, BKR stock has pushed well above its 50-day simple moving average. A bullish reversal in the MACD also supports the sharp move higher. However, with an RSI above 80 as of this writing, BKR may be due for a short-term pullback. Even without the potential catalyst from defense contracts, Baker Hughes looks like a good value at this level. To begin with, even after the sharp post-earnings move, Baker Hughes is trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 16.8x. That’s slightly above the stock’s historical average, but it’s reasonable relative to the sector average. Furthermore, the company approved a $3 billion share repurchase authorization and pays a dividend with a 2.4% yield.

MarketBeat Week in Review – 07/21 - 07/25,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/marketbeat-week-in-review-07-21-07-25/,"Stocks were up this week as the summer rally continues. There was mixed news from the tech sector this week, but on the whole, earnings have been better-than-expected. That trend will likely continue when many mega-cap technology stocks report next week. Continued capital expenditures in artificial intelligence are likely to be bullish for the sector. Another big story this week was the finalization of a trade deal between the United States and Japan. However, tariff uncertainty still lingers, particularly with the Trump administration’s August 1 deadline looming. There’s a lot to be sorted out that could move markets. Next week will be an important week for economic data. The Federal Reserve will issue its next decision on interest rates on Wednesday. The expectation is for no change in interest rates, but investors will look for any signal that a cut is coming in September. However, the bigger market mover may come from the July Jobs report on Friday. Articles by Thomas Hughes As important as AI is to investors today, Thomas Hughes wrote this week that Physical AI is the real endgame for this technology. However, that endgame is already taking shape, and Hughes gave investors five physical AI stocks that investors could buy today and hold for triple-digit returns. Turning his attention to value stocks, Hughes analyzed the earnings report from Verizon Communications, Inc. NYSE: VZ. The stock is known for its high-yield dividend, but Hughes explained why VZ stock is a solid growth opportunity after its bullish report. Congressional trading activity has become a topic of keen interest to investors. This week, Hughes highlighted the five stocks with the most Congressional selling in the year's first half and explained why you may or may not want to follow their lead. Articles by Sam Quirke Tesla Inc. NASDAQ: TSLA stock was down sharply after the company’s earnings report, in which chief executive officer (CEO) Elon Musk warned that the next two quarters could be challenging. Sam Quirke broke down the report and explained why analysts are playing the long game as traders move out of the stock. Qualcomm Inc. NASDAQ: QCOM is one of the more undervalued semiconductor stocks. Quirke noted that a recent price target hike and the company’s upcoming earnings report may mean the rally in QCOM stock is just getting started. On the other end of the value spectrum, Amazon.com Inc. NASDAQ: AMZN stock has rallied toward its February high. However, Quirke pointed out that the stock now comes with a relatively high valuation. That means investors may need a strong earnings report to push the stock higher. Articles by Chris Markoch Palantir Technologies Inc. NASDAQ: PLTR continues to outperform the broader market in 2025. However, Chris Markoch highlighted the sentiment shift between technical indicators and options activity. This could make PLTR stock more volatile than usual heading into its earnings report in early August. Many consumer discretionary stocks continue to underperform the market. However, that’s not the case for three streaming stocks. All three are moving lower after hitting an all-time high, but Markoch explained why each could reverse that trend with solid earnings. Markoch also introduced MarketBeat’s new FDA Events Tool and highlighted three small-cap biotech stocks with critical upcoming catalysts that could give investors a good reason to accumulate shares for future growth. Articles by Ryan Hasson All good things must come to an end. As Ryan Hasson wrote this week, that’s the general sentiment around the recent pullback in Rocket Lab USA Inc. NASDAQ: RKLB stock. The stock is down double digits from its parabolic move to an all-time high, but Hasson notes that technical and fundamental factors support the long-term bull case, which could make this a time to buy the dip. Alphabet Inc. NASDAQ: GOOGL stock has been lagging its Magnificent Seven counterparts this year. However, Hasson explained why that may change after the company crushed its earnings report and answered some key questions about the health of its search, cloud computing, and AI businesses. Investors may notice that risk-on sentiment is starting to run rampant. Hasson noted that impulse could be good for investors with room for speculative stocks in their portfolio. This week, Hasson analyzed five high-risk/high-reward stocks that are showing strong momentum. Articles by Gabriel Osorio-Mazilli The latest cryptocurrency rally started with Bitcoin surging to an all-time high. However, Gabriel Osorio-Mazilli explained to investors that the real opportunity may be in these three stocks that are bringing Bitcoin to the broader market. A sharp move higher in several stocks has some analysts believing meme stock mania is back. However, when it comes to the surge in Opendoor Technologies Inc. NASDAQ: OPEN, Osorio-Mazilli highlighted some key fundamental reasons that make the stock more than a retail play. Enthusiasm over the buildout of an AI infrastructure is reaching a fever pitch. Osorio-Mazilli explained why that is bullish for Super Micro Computer Inc. NASDAQ: SMCI. Institutional investors have moved beyond the accounting irregularities from earlier this year and are now leading the stock higher. Articles by Leo Miller A key theme in the tech sector is how one company’s growth plans positively impact another company’s stock. Leo Miller gave investors an example of that this week. Miller explained why Meta Platform Inc. NASDAQ: META's plans to invest in “titan cluster” data centers are a game-changer for Broadcom Inc. NASDAQ: AVGO stock. The quantum computing space continues to evolve quickly. This week, Miller highlighted the recent surge in Rigetti Computing Inc. NASDAQ: RGTI stock, being fueled by the company’s decision to take a step back to make a strong move forward. When companies raise their guidance, analysts typically begin raising their price targets. That combination is always bullish for a stock in the long term. This week, Miller pointed investors to four stocks receiving higher price targets fresh off of raised guidance in their earnings reports. Articles by Nathan Reiff This week, Nathan Reiff analyzed the recent surge in shares of D-Wave Quantum Inc. NYSE: QBTS. The stock appeared to be moving higher in concert with other quantum computing stocks. However, with no specific catalyst for the spike, Reiff reminded investors that, while QBTS stock looks promising, caution should be the watchword as profitability remains elusive. Companies are sometimes punished when an earnings report is only “good enough.” Reiff explained why that appears to be the case with three stocks that are down despite solid, but not spectacular, reports. This can be where long-term investors should pay attention to analysts upgrading these stocks, which could signal a buy-the-dip opportunity. Despite the continued interest in high-growth technology stocks, Reiff pointed out that investors looking for passive income and growth through dividend stocks haven’t been disappointed. That’s particularly true if they own one of the three high-yield dividend payers that carry some risk, but offer the chance of a market-beating reward. Articles by Dan Schmidt “Is China investable again?” Dan Schmidt attempted to answer this week. Schmidt noted that with trade tensions easing, three large-cap Chinese stocks are starting to look good for value investors. Robinhood Markets Inc. NASDAQ: HOOD has been one of the best-performing stocks in 2025. This week, Schmidt pointed out a small line item in the One Big, Beautiful Bill that will make the stock more attractive to professional sports bettors looking to reduce their tax burden. Articles by Jeffrey Neal Johnson Many MarketBeat analysts wrote about specific quantum computing stocks this week. Jeffrey Neal Johnson compiled much of that information to explain what catalysts are pushing three quantum computing stocks higher this summer. Johnson also wrote about the recent price spike in AST Spacemobile Inc. NASDAQ: ASTS after a recent contract announcement. Analysts haven’t jumped on board yet, but Johnson reminded investors that this could be one time when being early is just fine. The U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) has $900 billion to put to use. However, as Johnson wrote this week, it won’t be business as usual, which is good news for investors in Kratos Defense & Security Solutions Inc. NASDAQ: KTOS. Articles by Jordan Chussler Investing in AI and data centers doesn’t have to be exclusive to growth investors. This week, Jordan Chussler highlighted Iron Mountain Inc. NYSE: IRM, which operates as a real estate investment trust (REIT) in the data center space. Chussler explained why the company’s fundamentals suggest the stock could be an undervalued gem for buy-and-hold value investors. Speaking of value investors, many such investors walked away from AT&T Inc. NYSE: T after it cut its dividend in 2022. However, Chussler explained why recent legislation is likely to be bullish for the company’s fundamentals, and institutional buyers are starting to take notice.","The stock is known for its high-yield dividend, but Hughes explained why VZ stock is a solid growth opportunity after its bullish report.","Articles by Thomas Hughes As important as AI is to investors today, Thomas Hughes wrote this week that Physical AI is the real endgame for this technology.",Markoch also introduced MarketBeat’s new FDA Events Tool and highlighted three small-cap biotech stocks with critical upcoming catalysts that could give investors a good reason to accumulate shares for future growth.,"The stock is down double digits from its parabolic move to an all-time high, but Hasson notes that technical and fundamental factors support the long-term bull case, which could make this a time to buy the dip."
US-China trade talks: Can China reduce its export dependence?,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/us-china-trade-talks-can-china-reduce-its-export-dependence-2025-07-26/,"BEIJING (AP) — China’s high dependence on exports will likely be a key focus of a new round of U.S.-China trade talks this coming week in Stockholm, but a trade deal would not necessarily help Beijing to rebalance its economy. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said he hopes the negotiations can take up this issue, along with China's purchases of oil from Russia and Iran, which undercut American sanctions on those two countries. Hopes rose for a breakthrough in talks after U.S. President Donald Trump announced deals with Japan, Indonesia and the Philippines this week. The U.S. wants China to do two things: Reduce what both the U.S. and the European Union see as excess production capacity in many industries, including steel and electric vehicles. And secondly, to take steps to increase spending by Chinese consumers so the economy relies more on domestic demand and less on exports. “We could also discuss the elephant in the room, which is this great rebalancing that the Chinese need to do,” Bessent told financial news network CNBC. He said China's share of global manufacturing exports at nearly 30%, “can’t get any bigger, and it should probably shrink.” The issues are not new, and China has been working to address them for years, more for domestic reasons than to reduce its trade surpluses with the U.S. and other countries. Bessent's predecessor as treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, made industrial policy a focus of a trip to China last year. She blamed government subsidies for flooding the global market with “artificially cheap Chinese products.” The European Union, whose top leaders met their Chinese counterparts in Beijing on Thursday, has cited subsidies to justify EU tariffs on electric vehicles made in China. In the 1980s, the U.S. pressured Japan to boost consumer spending when American manufacturing was overwhelmed by exports from the likes of Toyota and Sony. Economists have long argued that China likewise needs to transform into a more consumer-driven economy. Consumer spending accounts for less than 40% of China’s economy, versus close to 70% in the United States and about 54% in Japan. Chinese leaders have spoken about both factory overcapacity and weak consumer spending as long-term problems and have sought over the past 20 years to find ways to rebalance the economy away from export manufacturing and massive investments in dams, roads, railways and other infrastructure. Fierce price wars have prompted critical reports in official media saying that companies are “racing to the bottom,” skimping on quality and even safety to reduce costs. With strong government support, they've also expanded overseas, where they can charge higher prices but still undercut local competitors, creating a political backlash. All that competition and price cutting has left China battling deflation, or falling prices. When companies receive less for their products, they tend to invest less. That can lead to job cuts and lower wages, sapping business activity and spending power — contrary to the long-term goal of increasing the share of consumer spending in driving overall growth. To counter that, the government is spending billions on rebates and subsidies for people who trade in their cars or appliances for new ones. But acknowledging a problem and solving it are two different things. Economists say more fundamental changes are needed to boost consumption and rein in overcapacity. Such changes can only come incrementally over time. Private Chinese companies and foreign-invested companies create the most jobs, but they've suffered from swings in policy and pressures from the trade war, especially since the pandemic. Demographic changes are another challenge as China's population shrinks and ages. Many experts advocate expanding China's social safety net, health insurance, pensions and other support systems, so that people would feel freer to spend rather than save for a medical emergency or retirement. Yan Se, an economist at Peking University's Guanghua School of Management, warned at a recent forum that deflation will become a long-term issue if China doesn't step up its welfare benefits. “Chinese people deserve a better life,"" he said. One possibility, put forward at the same forum by Liu Qiao, the dean of the business school, would be to change incentives for local government officials, rewarding them for raising consumption or household incomes instead of meeting an economic growth target. He doesn't see that happening nationwide but said it could be tested in a province. “That would send out a message that China needs a different approach,” he said. Chinese leader Xi Jinping has made transforming the country into a technology superpower a top priority. It's a goal that has gained urgency as the U.S. has tightened restrictions on China's access to high-end semiconductors and other advanced knowhow. Output in high-tech manufacturing is growing quickly, adding to potential overcapacity, just as what happened with the government's encouragement of “green” technologies such as solar panels and wind turbines. Various industries, including EV makers, have pledged to address the issue, but some local governments are striving to keep money-losing enterprises afloat, reluctant to lose tax revenues and jobs, or to fail to meet economic growth targets. Going forward, the government is calling for more coordination of economic development polices in fields such as artificial intelligence so that not every province champions the same industry. But government moves to counter the impact of higher tariffs tend to support sectors already in overcapacity, and the share of consumption in the economy has fallen in recent years. “A sustained improvement in household consumption will require greater reform ambition,” the World Bank said in its most recent update on China's economy."" ___ AP Business Writer Elaine Kurtenbach in Bangkok contributed to this report.","He said China's share of global manufacturing exports at nearly 30%, “can’t get any bigger, and it should probably shrink.” The issues are not new, and China has been working to address them for years, more for domestic reasons than to reduce its trade surpluses with the U.S. and other countries.","BEIJING (AP) — China’s high dependence on exports will likely be a key focus of a new round of U.S.-China trade talks this coming week in Stockholm, but a trade deal would not necessarily help Beijing to rebalance its economy.","U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said he hopes the negotiations can take up this issue, along with China's purchases of oil from Russia and Iran, which undercut American sanctions on those two countries.","He said China's share of global manufacturing exports at nearly 30%, “can’t get any bigger, and it should probably shrink.” The issues are not new, and China has been working to address them for years, more for domestic reasons than to reduce its trade surpluses with the U.S. and other countries."
Policy officially takes over for Murphy as president/CEO at Packers' shareholders meeting,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/policy-officially-takes-over-for-murphy-as-presidentceo-at-packers-shareholders-meeting-2025-07-25/,"GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) — Ed Policy began his tenure as the Green Bay Packers’ president/CEO by paying tribute to his predecessor. Policy officially took over for Mark Murphy on Friday as the NFL’s only publicly owned franchise held its annual shareholders meeting. During Murphy’s 17 seasons on the job, the Packers made 13 playoff appearances, with the 2010 team winning a Super Bowl. “I assure you that going forward I’m going to lean heavily on your example and your pearls of wisdom as I move the organization into the future,” Policy said. Murphy is stepping down because he reached the franchise’s mandatory retirement age of 70 earlier this month. Murphy said he felt he could continue meeting the demands of this position but added that he agrees with the Packers’ retirement policy. “In my career – business and with the league and others – you see examples where maybe people stay on a little too long, so I think this serves the Packers well,” Murphy said. Policy, 54, didn’t focus much on his own plans during the shareholders meeting, which instead pretty much served as a testimonial for Murphy. There were plenty of shouts of “Thank you, Mark,” among the 6,529 shareholders in the Lambeau Field stands. On a hot afternoon, many shareholders tried to cool themselves off by waving fans that featured Murphy’s face. A tribute video included messages from NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and former commissioner Paul Tagliabue among others. Murphy signed autographs and greeted fans after the Packers’ Friday morning practice and again after the shareholders meeting. “It’s a little bittersweet,” Murphy said. “Obviously, I’m a very appreciative and I also feel honored, too, that the fans have been so supportive of me and the organization. But (I’m) really excited too for the future of the organization and for Ed in particular.” The Packers say Murphy, who played defensive back for Washington from 1977-84, is believed to be the only person to earn a Super Bowl ring both as a player and as a team’s chief executive. He was on Washington’s 1982 championship team. His stint as Green Bay’s president/CEO included the construction of Titletown, a 45-acre development adjacent to Lambeau Field that features shops, restaurants and apartments. He capped his tenure earlier this year by welcoming the NFL Draft to Green Bay, an event that drew an announced three-day total attendance of 600,000. Murphy also presided over multiple renovations to Lambeau Field, including the opening of a new home locker room this week. “He’s been tremendous for us,” wide receiver Jayden Reed said. “I thanked him today, knowing this was his last day here, so I went up to him and I thanked him for everything. Without him, we wouldn’t be standing in this locker room right now. He’s been a tremendous help to all of us, very supportive. He gets this thing done. I appreciate him for that.” Murphy said he hopes to stay involved in the game and noted that he’s talked to Goodell about things he’d like to do on a league level. He also mentioned spending more time with his family and increasing his involvement in his charity work and in the golf course he owns at Baileys Harbor, Wisconsin. The Packers’ board of directors unanimously selected Policy as Murphy’s replacement after a search committee recommended him last year. Policy, the son of former San Francisco 49ers and Cleveland Browns president, joined the Packers as vice president and general counsel in August 2012 and was promoted to chief operating officer in January 2018. “I want to thank you, our owners, for investing so much in me over the past 13 years,” Policy told the shareholders. “It’s been really special, and I intend to pay it back with results both on and off the field.” Packers coach Matt LaFleur, general manager Brian Gutekunst and executive vice president/director of player operations Russ Ball report to the president/CEO under the team’s leadership structure. All three of them have two years remaining on their contracts. Policy said earlier this year he has no plans to extend those contracts before this season, though he praised all three men and noted his long working relationships with them. “(I’m) certainly going to miss Mark and everything that he’s done for this place, but feel like we’re in great hands with a guy like Ed Policy,” LaFleur said. Murphy was asked what advice he had for Policy. “The one thing I told him is he’s got to be himself,” Murphy said. “I’ve seen him grow quite a bit as a leader. The search ended up with him. They did a great job. There’s no question he’s positioned and ready to have success. “He and I have talked about it. Don’t be afraid to change things. Follow your instincts. He’s got really good business sense. Hopefully we put him in a position where he can have success not only in the short term but the long term of the organization.” NOTES: LaFleur said OL Aaron Banks is “day to day” with a back issue. … Rookie WR Savion Williams didn’t practice Friday due to a concussion. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL","“The one thing I told him is he’s got to be himself,” Murphy said.","But (I’m) really excited too for the future of the organization and for Ed in particular.” The Packers say Murphy, who played defensive back for Washington from 1977-84, is believed to be the only person to earn a Super Bowl ring both as a player and as a team’s chief executive.","His stint as Green Bay’s president/CEO included the construction of Titletown, a 45-acre development adjacent to Lambeau Field that features shops, restaurants and apartments.","But (I’m) really excited too for the future of the organization and for Ed in particular.” The Packers say Murphy, who played defensive back for Washington from 1977-84, is believed to be the only person to earn a Super Bowl ring both as a player and as a team’s chief executive."
Paramount gets green light for $8 billion merger. But what is the psychic cost for company?,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/paramount-gets-green-light-for-8-billion-merger-but-what-is-the-psychic-cost-for-company-2025-07-25/,"With this week’s FCC approval, the merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media is expected to be completed in the coming weeks at a value of $8 billion. The question for the new company is whether the psychic cost is much higher. It has been a particularly rough few months at Paramount-owned CBS, where the settlement of a lawsuit regarding “60 Minutes” and announced end of Stephen Colbert's late-night show has led critics to suggest corporate leaders were bowing to President Donald Trump. Following the Federal Communications Commission approval Thursday, one of the triumvirate of current Paramount leaders, Chris McCarthy, said that he would be leaving the company. McCarthy has been in charge of fading cable properties like MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon, expected to bear the brunt of an estimated $2 billion in cost cuts identified by Skydance leaders. Skydance head David Ellison is expected to head the new company, and he has identified former NBC Universal executive Jeff Shell as the incoming president. After the merger's Aug. 7 closing date, the new leaders will be watched most closely for how they deal with CBS News, particularly given the $16 million paid in a settlement of Trump's complaint that last fall's “60 Minutes” interview was edited to make opponent Kamala Harris look good. Two news executives — News CEO Wendy McMahon and “60 Minutes” executive producer Bill Owens — resigned due to their opposition to the deal. The appointment of respected insider Tanya Simon to replace Owens this week was seen as a positive sign by people at “60 Minutes.” Days before the FCC's vote, Paramount agreed to hire an ombudsman at CBS News with the mission of investigating complaints of political bias. “In all respects, Skydance will ensure that CBS's reporting is fair, unbiased, and fact-based,” Skydance said in a letter to FCC Chairman Brendan Carr. The role of an ombudsman, or public editor, who examines a news outlet's work is often positive — if they are given independence, said Kelly McBride, an ethics expert who has had that role at NPR for five years. “You really want the person to have loyalty only to their own judgment and the journalistic mission of the organization,” she said. Having the sole mission of examining bias could be problematic, however. To be fair, a journalist's work should be closely studied before making that determination, not judged on the basis of one report or passage, she said. Carr, in an interview with CNBC on Friday, said the role “should go a long way toward restoring America's trust in media.” Anna Gomez, an FCC commissioner who voted to reject the deal on Thursday, interpreted the arrangement as a way for the government to control journalists. “They want the news media to report on them in a positive light or in the light that they want,” Gomez told MSNBC. “So they don't want the media to do their job, which is to hold government to account without fear or favor.” According to published reports, Ellison has explored purchasing The Free Press, a flourishing news site founded by Bari Weiss perhaps best known for a former NPR editor's study of liberal bias in public broadcasting. An Ellison spokeswoman did not return a message seeking comment on Friday. Colbert's slow-motion firing — he'll work until the end of his contract next May — was described by CBS as a financial decision given late-night television's collapsing economics. Colbert's relentless lampooning of Trump, and his criticism of the “60 Minutes” settlement, led to suspicion of those motives. “Was this really financial?” comic Jon Stewart wondered. ""Or maybe the path of least resistance for your $8 billion merger was killing a show that you know rankled a fragile and vengeful president?” Stewart's profane criticism on his own Paramount-owned show may provide its own test for Skydance. “The Daily Show” is one of the few original programs left on Comedy Central, and his contract ends later this year. In an odd way, Comedy Central's “South Park” buttresses CBS' claim that the Colbert decision was financial, not political. Creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone delivered an episode this week that depicted a naked Trump in bed with the devil. Paramount just signed Parker and Stone to a new $1.5 billion deal that Skydance executives surely cleared; it makes the entire “South Park” library available for streaming on Paramount+. a platform where Colbert's show doesn't do nearly as well. Figuring out what to do with others at Paramount's cable networks, or even the networks as a whole, will be an early decision for Ellison, son of multibillionaire and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison. “There is a clear opportunity to improve Paramount's growth profile by letting those assets go,” analyst Doug Creutz of TD Securities told investors Friday. “On the other hand, we suspect the Ellisons did not purchase Paramount in order to break it up for parts.” The merger also brings together the Paramount movie studio with one of its most regular partners. David Ellison has been one of the industry's top investors and producers since founding Skydance in 2006. Ellison has a challenge here, too: Years of uncertainty over its future and modest investment in its movie pipeline has shrunk Paramount's market share to last among the major studios. The Paramount+ streaming service has been a money-loser. To revive Paramount, Ellison will look to revamp its streaming operations, leverage its franchises and try to bolster family content. ___ AP Film Writer Jake Coyle contributed to this report.

"Tea, an app for women to safely talk about men they date, has been breached, user IDs exposed",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/tea-an-app-for-women-to-safely-talk-about-men-they-date-has-been-breached-user-ids-exposed-2025-07-25/,"Tea, an app designed to let women safely discuss men they date has been breached, with thousands of selfies and photo IDs of users exposed, the company confirmed on Friday. Tea said that about 72,000 images were leaked online, including 13,000 images of selfies or selfies featuring a photo identification that users submitted during account verification. Another 59,000 images publicly viewable in the app from posts, comments and direct messages were also accessed without authorization, according to a Tea spokesperson. No email addresses or phone numbers were accessed, the company said, and the breach only affects users who signed up before February 2024. “Tea has engaged third-party cybersecurity experts and are working around the clock to secure its systems,” the company said. “At this time, there is no evidence to suggest that additional user data was affected.

3 Stocks Flying Under the S&P 500 Radar,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/3-stocks-flying-under-the-s-and-p-500-radar/,"The S&P 500 is the benchmark index used by most investors. In fact, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust NYSEARCA: SPY is one of the most widely held index funds for passive investors. Investing in the SPY has been a good strategy in the last few years as mega-cap technology stocks dominated the market. This had the added benefit of giving investors exposure to themes like industrial automation, artificial intelligence (AI), and semiconductors. However, as the market rally broadens into other sectors, focusing only on those names can introduce investors to more risk and less reward than they may think. The SPY is a market-cap weighted index, which means it will buy the stocks with the highest market capitalizations, independent of any other fundamentals. As of July 24, its two largest holdings are NVIDIA Corp. NASDAQ: NVDA and Microsoft Corp. NASDAQ: MSFT. The good news is that investors benefit from the positive momentum in these stocks. However, that growth comes at a premium, and investors may not capture faster-growing stocks. Investors looking to diversify their portfolio should consider the opportunities in small-cap and international stocks. These can offer higher growth potential, especially at the beginning of a long-term innovation cycle like what is happening with AI. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are an emerging story. Companies such as Tesla Inc. NASDAQ: TSLA and Alphabet Inc. NASDAQ: GOOGL have launched fleets of their robotaxis and Waymo AVs in select markets around the world. Now, the question is one of scale. In the case of Waymo, that will mean LiDAR technology. Investors see that opportunity in a company like Aeva Technologies Inc. NASDAQ: AEVA. With a market cap of $1.3 billion, it’s not the biggest name in the LiDAR space. However, the company differentiates itself with a 4D LiDAR system that measures distance and velocity using a unique Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) technology. The ability to measure velocity is a key advancement in LiDAR technology and allows Aeva to notch several contracts in the autonomous vehicle space in 2025. This is not contributing to revenue yet, but investors are looking past that. AEVA stock is up 401% in 2025. In June and July, analysts from Roth Capital and Oppenheimer raised their price targets on the stock. However, the stock is down 20% in the last month suggesting that short interest over 17% is weighing on the stock. Ouster Inc. NYSE: OUST is an example of why there’s enough room in the autonomous vehicle space for several competitors. In the case of Ouster, it’s not how the company is executing on LiDAR technology; it’s where. Ouster is focusing on defense, robotics, and industrial automation markets. In June, the company’s digital LiDAR was approved by the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) for unmanned aircraft. This aligns with the Pentagon's plans to use the increased defense spending coming after the One Big, Beautiful Bill passed through Congress. However, the revenue from these projects will take time to be realized. That’s why investors may need to wait for a better entry point. As of this writing, OUST stock is up approximately 126% in 2025 and over 258% in the last three months. It’s well above its consensus price target as animal spirits are taking over the market. Nevertheless, the company’s upcoming earnings in August could give the bulls the upper hand. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing NYSE: TSM is hardly a small-cap company. With a market cap of over $1.25 trillion, the Taiwan-based chip foundry is one of the largest companies in the chip sector. It’s also one of the best-performing stocks and has room to run. A key reason for investors to believe in the company’s growth is its contracts with Apple Inc. NASDAQ: AAPL, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. NASDAQ: AMD and NVIDIA. With few competitors to threaten its leadership, Taiwan Semiconductor will continue to be at the heart of chip manufacturing. TSM stock is up 22% in 2025, but the focus is likely on what’s next. The company delivered a strong earnings report on July 17 with revenue up 50% year-over-year (YOY) and earnings per share (EPS) up 66% YOY. Institutional investors continue to invest in the company despite geopolitical concerns, fueling the stock's bullish outlook.

Qualcomm's Next Gear: A Growth Story Wall Street Might Be Missing,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/qualcomms-next-gear-a-growth-story-wall-street-might-be-missing/,"Qualcomm NASDAQ: QCOM heads into its third-quarter earnings report on July 30, and Wall Street will be watching closely. For years, the company has served as a key indicator for the health of the mobile industry, with its fortunes closely tied to smartphone sales. However, investors who focus only on handset numbers risk missing a fundamental and exciting transformation. A multi-year strategy to diversify the business is now bearing significant fruit. Qualcomm is aggressively expanding into high-growth sectors, building a more resilient company that is less dependent on the cyclical smartphone market. This successful pivot is creating a compelling new investment case centered on the future of automotive technology, artificial intelligence (AI) powered PCs, and the vast possibilities of the Internet of Things (IoT). One of the clearest signs of Qualcomm’s evolution is its accelerating growth in the automotive industry. This segment is quickly becoming a primary engine for the company, delivering impressive financial results and building a foundation for long-term, predictable revenue. In its second fiscal quarter, Qualcomm's automotive revenues reached $959 million, representing a remarkable 59% increase from the same period last year. The Snapdragon Digital Chassis platform drives this growth. It is a comprehensive suite of solutions that automakers use to power digital cockpits, in-car connectivity, and Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS). This platform approach makes Qualcomm an essential technology partner in the modern software-defined vehicle. To further secure its position, Qualcomm completed its acquisition of Autotalks in June 2025. This move integrates industry-leading Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication technology into its portfolio, a cornerstone for future autonomous driving and road safety systems. For investors, these long-term automotive design wins provide a stable and growing revenue stream, directly offsetting the volatility of the consumer phone market and supporting the company's goal of achieving $8 billion in annual automotive revenue. Qualcomm's expansion goes well beyond the car. The company’s IoT segment, which grew 27% year-over-year to $1.6 billion in Q2, has become a launchpad for entering new device categories, most notably the AI PC. With its Snapdragon X Elite processors, Qualcomm has emerged as a serious competitor in a market long dominated by legacy players. These chips offer key advantages in power efficiency and on-device AI processing, enabling a new generation of laptops with multi-day battery life. This is already translating into market share. In the first calendar quarter of 2025, Snapdragon-powered devices captured approximately 9% of the premium Windows laptop market in the U.S. and key European countries. Qualcomm's vision for the intelligent edge is also pushing into the data center. The company's recently announced plan to acquire Alphawave Semi OTCMKTS: AWEVF for approximately $2.4 billion provides critical high-speed connectivity technology, accelerating its expansion into a massive, high-margin market driven by global demand for AI. This, combined with new partnerships in industrial IoT, shows a clear strategy: to make Qualcomm's technology a fundamental part of the connected economy. For investors looking to validate this growth story, the upcoming earnings report offers a clear opportunity. Beyond the headline numbers, these specific metrics will signal if the diversification strategy is maintaining its powerful momentum: Qualcomm's successful pivot is reinforcing its financial strength and commitment to rewarding investors. With a trailing price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of approximately 16, the stock’s valuation suggests that the market may not yet be fully pricing in these durable, high-growth revenue streams. Wall Street is taking note, with a consensus 12-month analyst price target near $185, implying a potential upside of over 15% from its current price. Management is signaling its confidence through its actions. The company offers a healthy dividend yielding around 2.25% and has committed to returning 100% of its free cash flow to shareholders in fiscal 2025. This is a powerful statement of belief in the long-term cash-generating power of its new ventures. Qualcomm’s strategic execution has set it on a clear path to becoming a more balanced and diversified technology leader. While its legacy is in mobile, its future is being built in our cars, on our desks, and across the intelligent enterprise. The upcoming earnings report will be another key checkpoint in a compelling long-term growth story that is just getting started.

Continuous glucose monitors are in vogue. But do you really need to track your blood sugar?,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/continuous-glucose-monitors-are-in-vogue-but-do-you-really-need-to-track-your-blood-sugar-2025-07-26/,"A quarter-size device that tracks the rise and fall of sugar in your blood is the latest source of hope — and hype — in the growing buzz around wearable health technology. Continuous glucose monitors, small patches that provide 24-hour insight into concentrations of sugar in the blood, could be a tool for Americans to “take control over their own health,” Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently told federal lawmakers. “They can take responsibility,” Kennedy said. “They can begin to make good judgments about their diet, about their physical activity, about the way they live their lives.” The devices have lifesaving benefits for people with diabetes, the disease caused when blood sugar remains high because their bodies don't make enough insulin or become resistant to it. The condition, which affects more than 38 million people in the U.S., raises the risk of serious health problems such as heart and kidney disease and vision loss. But the devices have surged in popularity among people without diabetes. Sales have been driven by high-profile marketers such as Casey Means, the nominee for U.S. surgeon general. There’s scant evidence the monitors are useful for people with normal blood sugar levels, said Dr. Jody Dushay, an endocrine specialist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Healthy bodies can effectively regulate glucose after meals and provide the energy they need to function. Glucose monitors may lead people to misinterpret normal swings in blood sugar that happen after eating or activity. In addition, the devices can be “notoriously inaccurate,” providing misleading readings, she said. “The problem with wearing these is that you can just be zooming in on and creating pathology when it’s not there,” Dushay said. Here’s what you need to know about the devices: The device is a small patch, about the size of two stacked quarters, usually placed on the upper arm or stomach. It uses a needle to painlessly pierce the skin for a tiny sensor. The sensor measures the glucose in fluid under the skin, delivering a signal every few minutes to a phone app or a handheld display. The apps typically record blood sugar levels and help people track the foods they eat and how they impact those levels. When healthy people eat a meal that contains carbohydrates, their blood sugar rises, peaks and falls in response to the food. A healthy fasting blood glucose level for a person without diabetes is roughly 70 milligrams per deciliter to 99 milligrams per deciliter. A range from 100 to 126 milligrams per deciliter indicates prediabetes and above 126 milligrams per deciliter indicates diabetes, according to the American Diabetes Association. In adults without diabetes, blood sugar levels can climb to 140 milligrams per deciliter or more within an hour of a meal, before falling back to baseline levels within two or three hours, according to the association. It's a sign the body is processing sugar normally. For decades, these devices were available only for people with diabetes. The monitors revolutionized care by allowing more precise adjustment of insulin used to treat diabetes and giving people the ability to modify meals and activity more accurately. Last year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first over-the-counter monitors. Since then, many companies have emerged to market them, claiming to provide intensive, individualized health monitoring. Cost is generally about $100 a month. They’ve really caught on with consumers curious about how food and activity affect their blood sugar levels. For instance, Noom, the weight-loss and fitness app, launched a blood glucose feature last year that has proven extremely popular, said Alexander Fabry, a company executive. “Of the people who are using a CGM, the vast majority of them don’t have a diabetes diagnosis,” he said. The devices have been lifesaving for people with diabetes. And they can be helpful for people with risk factors for the disease, including obesity, prediabetes, a history of gestational diabetes or a family history of the condition. The devices can allow users to see how specific food and activity choices affect their blood sugar in near real-time, said Dr. Alaina Vidmar, a pediatric obesity specialist at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles. “After a large meal, you may watch your blood sugar go up and sort of learn something about yourself,” Vidmar said. “For example, I drink a sugar-sweetened soda and my blood sugar goes up really high, really fast. And maybe I don't feel as good, right?” People without risk factors for diabetes may turn to the monitors just because they’re curious, said Dr. David Kessler. A former FDA commissioner, Kessler doesn’t have diabetes, but he wore a monitor for a couple months during research for his recent book, “Diet, Drugs and Dopamine.” “I think it’s a very interesting tool to experiment with if you’re so inclined,” Kessler said. But, he noted, the devices can’t be used to diagnose or treat disease. Even experts don't agree on how to interpret or provide health advice for people without diabetes based on blood sugar data. “No one knows what’s optimal in the nondiabetic state,” he said. Before using a monitor, Dushay asks patients to consider their motives. “What do you think you're going to get from the data?” she said. “What is to be gained from wearing that monitor?” ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

3 Cloud Build-Out Stocks Behind the AI Infrastructure Boom,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/3-cloud-build-out-stocks-behind-the-ai-infrastructure-boom/,"Investors continue to invest in technology stocks, particularly those with an artificial intelligence (AI) theme. However, for some investors, their choice of stocks to buy may be based on FOMO (fear of missing out) rather than allowing a deeper understanding of what’s happening in the tech space to inform their investment decisions. One area to consider is how cloud computing is changing. The idea of accessing data and running applications via the internet, as opposed to local computers and servers, is over 20 years old. However, it’s evolving fast to meet the needs of AI. This boils down to infrastructure. Data centers have been around for decades. However, generative (and now agentic) AI and machine learning require more of everything (power, cooling, network speed, and density). In many cases, hyperscalers like Microsoft Corp. NASDAQ: MSFT, Amazon.com Inc. NASDAQ: AMZN and Meta Platforms Inc. NASDAQ: META can’t just retrofit existing data centers. They have to be created from the ground up. This is the “cloud build-out,"" and it will take years and billions in capital expenditures to make it a reality. That's an investable theme every investor can understand and profit from today. Here are three companies supplying the building blocks of this new infrastructure. The case for Prologis Inc. NYSE: PLD is easy to understand. The first step in building a next-generation data center is finding land with power access and necessary permitting. Prologis is the global leader in logistics real estate. In its latest earnings report, Prologis announced a shift in focus to data centers and AI infrastructure hubs. The company is repurposing logistics-adjacent land and buying new property in power-rich areas that will support the needs of hyperscalers. PLD stock is up 4.1% in 2025 and continues to consolidate following its earnings on July 16. Analysts have a consensus price target of $119.67, which could provide an additional 8.75% upside in addition to a dividend yield of 3.67%. Plus, at 16x forward earnings, the company is attractively valued compared to its historical averages. Putting NVIDIA Corp. NASDAQ: NVDA seems too easy. However, NVIDIA provides a good starting point for looking at Super Micro Computer Inc. NASDAQ: SMCI. The company designs and builds high-performance server and storage systems tailored for AI, cloud, and enterprise computing. This includes NVIDIA GPUs, which are the current gold standard for generative AI workloads. Super Micro is growing rapidly with triple-digit revenue growth in recent quarters. There is growing speculation that Meta Platforms, Inc. NASDAQ: META will award Super Micro a contract to provide cooling services for its new data centers. This is a pure-play picks-and-shovels stock for the hardware that the cloud buildout will require. SMCI stock is up 69% in 2025, but investors should note that it is expensive to itself at around 27x forward earnings. Analysts give the stock a consensus price target of $42.89, which is 17% below its closing price on July 23. Just like many specialists (electricians, plumbers, painters) are needed to construct a house, the same is true of data centers. Super Micro provides the compute layer, but Arista Networks Inc. NYSE: ANET provides the networking layer. This includes the high-speed networking equipment that allows servers to communicate with each other. Arista already has contracts with companies such as Meta Platforms and Microsoft, making it the logical choice for these next-generation data centers. That positioning shows up in the company’s financials: Arista has high operating margins, a strong balance sheet, and consistent profitability. ANET stock has increased 59% in the last three months. That’s not surprising given the billions of dollars in capital expenditures announced by the hyperscalers during that time. More importantly, analysts are raising their price targets for the stock ahead of the company’s earnings in early August. Before you consider Arista Networks, you'll want to hear this.","This is the “cloud build-out,"" and it will take years and billions in capital expenditures to make it a reality.","There is growing speculation that Meta Platforms, Inc.

Beer and food workers on strike at Fenway Park for homestand between Dodgers and Red Sox,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/beer-and-food-workers-on-strike-at-fenway-for-homestand-between-dodgers-and-red-sox-2025-07-25/,"BOSTON (AP) — Striking Fenway Park vendors banged on drums and shouted “Don't buy food!” while walking a picket line outside the home of the Boston Red Sox before Friday night's game against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Hundreds of Aramark workers marched along the street behind the team's right field concourse before the series opener, carrying round picket signs decorated with red baseball stitching. A giant inflatable rat shared the sidewalk with a statue of Red Sox greats Ted Williams, Bobby Doerr, Dom DiMaggio and Johnny Pesky. Another group of picketers circled behind home plate after the first pitch as Local 26 of the Massachusetts and Rhode Island hotel, casino, airport and food services workers union went on strike at noon on Friday. It posted on social media that it is asking for “living wages, guardrails on technology and R-E-S-P-E-C-T!” It's believed to be the first union walkout in the ballpark's 113-year-history. “Respect the picket line,"" the union posted. “We know tix are expensive, we’re not asking you to stay away from the home games. But we ARE asking you to not buy concessions. No purchase of pretzels, pickles or peanuts inside the ballpark during the homestand.” An Aramark spokesman said the company has bargained in good faith and is “disappointed the union rejected our latest offer and chose to call a strike.” “We are committed to delivering an outstanding fan experience and have contingency plans in place to ensure fans will not encounter service interruptions,” the company said. The Red Sox noted that the team was not involved in the negotiations but remained in contact with the concessionaire. Aramark made an offer as recently as Thursday night that was rejected by the union, the team said. “Aramark has implemented its contingency staffing plans, and fans can expect a full and uninterrupted ballpark experience this weekend, including access to all food, beverage, and hospitality services throughout Fenway Park,” the team said. ""We remain hopeful that the parties will reach a swift and fair resolution.” A Red Sox spokeswoman said after Friday night's game, a full house of 36,369, that “ballpark concessions performed at the expected levels consistent with tonight’s sold out crowd.” U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders called on the team to support the vendors. “Fenway Park is an iconic American institution, and it’s the workers there that make every Red Sox game special,” he posted on social media. “The team is extremely profitable. They should treat their employees with respect, pay them decent wages and negotiate a fair contract with the union.” Maggie McCue, a beer vendor with 19 years of experience who is 24 weeks pregnant with twins, took a break from marching in the near-90 degree temperatures to eat a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Her mother, also a beer vendor for almost two decades, said the team can afford for the workers to be paid a living wage. “They have more money than they need,” Marianne McCue said. “We are Fenway. Fenway is us. Some people have been here 40-something years and they're not even backing us up. Shame on them. I never thought that at 70 years old I would be on strike, but here we are."" The Red Sox play three games against the Dodgers before leaving town again for a series beginning Monday night in Minneapolis against the Twins. It was a chance for Boston fans to welcome back ex-Red Sox star Mookie Betts, who was traded to Los Angeles in a cost-cutting move a year after winning the AL MVP. Now, with Betts returning to town, the vendors are looking to get paid. “It's come full circle,” Maggie McCue said. “Full circle.” ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",BOSTON (AP) — Striking Fenway Park vendors banged on drums and shouted “Don't buy food!” while walking a picket line outside the home of the Boston Red Sox before Friday night's game against the Los Angeles Dodgers.,"No purchase of pretzels, pickles or peanuts inside the ballpark during the homestand.” An Aramark spokesman said the company has bargained in good faith and is “disappointed the union rejected our latest offer and chose to call a strike.” “We are committed to delivering an outstanding fan experience and have contingency plans in place to ensure fans will not encounter service interruptions,” the company said.","“Fenway Park is an iconic American institution, and it’s the workers there that make every Red Sox game special,” he posted on social media.","No purchase of pretzels, pickles or peanuts inside the ballpark during the homestand.” An Aramark spokesman said the company has bargained in good faith and is “disappointed the union rejected our latest offer and chose to call a strike.” “We are committed to delivering an outstanding fan experience and have contingency plans in place to ensure fans will not encounter service interruptions,” the company said."

Pakistan urges global social media platforms to block accounts run by banned militant groups,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/pakistan-urges-global-social-media-platforms-to-block-accounts-run-by-banned-militant-groups-2025-07-25/,"ISLAMABAD (AP) — Pakistan on Friday urged global social media companies to take action to block hundreds of accounts allegedly run by outlawed militant groups that Islamabad claims spread propaganda and glorify insurgents in the South Asian country. According to Pakistan’s Deputy Interior Minister Talal Chaudhry, groups such as the Pakistani Taliban and the separatist Balochistan Liberation Army — banned by the Pakistani authorities and also designated as terrorist groups by the United States — have been using X, Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Telegram to promote violence in Pakistan. Chaudhry, who spoke to reporters at a news conference, urged the tech companies to remove or disable these accounts, as well as those run by supporters of the militant groups. Deputy Law Minister Aqeel Malik, who also spoke at the new conference, said Pakistani investigators have identified 481 accounts associated with the Pakistani Taliban, known as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan or TTP, and the Balochistan Liberation Army, or BLA. The accounts were being used to incite violence and spread hate speech, Malik said. There was no immediate response from any of the social media platforms to Pakistan's request. Pakistan itself has in recent years blocked access to X, primarily to curb criticism from supporters of imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan but also voices of other dissenters. The plea comes amid a surge in violence across Pakistan, much of it blamed on the two militant groups, as well as the Islamic State group. The Pakistani Taliban are allies but a separate militant group from the Afghan Taliban. However, the Taliban takeover of neighboring Afghanistan in 2021 has emboldened the TTP. Militant groups also heavily rely on social media platforms to claim responsibility for attacks against security forces and civilians in Pakistan. Before you consider Meta Platforms, you'll want to hear this.","Chaudhry, who spoke to reporters at a news conference, urged the tech companies to remove or disable these accounts, as well as those run by supporters of the militant groups.","According to Pakistan’s Deputy Interior Minister Talal Chaudhry, groups such as the Pakistani Taliban and the separatist Balochistan Liberation Army — banned by the Pakistani authorities and also designated as terrorist groups by the United States — have been using X, Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Telegram to promote violence in Pakistan.",Militant groups also heavily rely on social media platforms to claim responsibility for attacks against security forces and civilians in Pakistan.,"According to Pakistan’s Deputy Interior Minister Talal Chaudhry, groups such as the Pakistani Taliban and the separatist Balochistan Liberation Army — banned by the Pakistani authorities and also designated as terrorist groups by the United States — have been using X, Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Telegram to promote violence in Pakistan."
Education Department says it will release billions in remaining withheld grant money for schools,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/education-department-says-it-will-release-billions-in-remaining-withheld-grant-money-for-schools-2025-07-25/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is releasing billions of dollars in withheld grants for schools, the Education Department said Friday, ending weeks of uncertainty for educators around the country who rely on the money for English language instruction, adult literacy, and other programs. President Donald Trump's administration had suspended more than $6 billion in funding on July 1, as part of a review to ensure spending aligned with the White House’s priorities. The funding freeze had been challenged by several lawsuits as educators, Congress members from both parties and others called for the administration to release the money. Congress had appropriated the money in a bill signed this year by Trump. Last week, the Education Department said it would release $1.3 billion of the money for after-school and summer programming. Without the money, school districts and nonprofits such as the YMCA and Boys and Girls Club of America had said they would have to close or scale back educational offerings this fall. The Office of Management and Budget had completed its review of the programs and will begin sending the money to states next week, the Education Department said. A group of 10 Republican senators on July 16 sent a letter imploring the administration to allow the frozen education money to be sent to states, saying the withheld money supported programs and services that are critical to local communities. “The programs are ones that enjoy longstanding, bipartisan support,” U.S. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., said Friday. She pointed to after-school and summer programs that allow parents to work while their children learn and classes that help adults gain new skills — contributing to local economies. In withholding the funds, the Office of Management and Budget had said some of the programs supported a “ radical leftwing agenda. ” “We share your concern,” the GOP senators had written. “However, we do not believe that is happening with these funds.” School superintendents had warned they would have to eliminate academic services without the money. On Friday, AASA, an association of superintendents, thanked members of Congress for pressing to release the money. In Harford County, Maryland, some of the withheld federal money made up more than half the budget for the district’s annual summer camp for kids learning English. The money helps the district hire certified teachers to staff the camp, incorporating learning into children's play for four weeks during the summer. The program helps kids keep their English and academic momentum over the summer. The district serves roughly 1,100 students who are non-native English speakers. Many of them are born in the U.S. to parents who came to the area seeking job opportunities, often in the restaurants and warehouses that have popped up in the past decades in the region northeast of Baltimore. During the school year, the soon-to-be-released federal money pays for tutors for kids learning English. On Thursday, more than 350 children filled the second floor of Bel Air High School for the second-to-last day of summer camp. Young learners crowded around an alphabet wheel, jostling with each other to push each letter button as they thought of foods starting with letters from A to Z. Middle school students watched a robotics team demonstration, and a few sheepishly raised their hands when asked if they would be interested in joining. High school student volunteers, some of whom had been campers learning English themselves not many years ago, helped the youngest children with art projects. The uncertainty around the funding was an unnecessary distraction for schools, said U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wa. “Instead of spending the last many weeks figuring out how to improve after-school options and get our kids’ reading and math scores up, because of President Trump, communities across the country have been forced to spend their time cutting back on tutoring options and sorting out how many teachers they will have to lay off,"" Murray said. The grants that were under review included $2 billion for teachers’ professional development and efforts to reduce class size; $1 billion for academic enrichment grants, often used for science and math education and accelerated learning; $890 million for students who are learning English; $376 million to educate the children of migrant workers; and $715 million to teach adults how to read. It added up to millions of dollars for the nation’s largest school districts. Data available from the Census for three of the grant programs — teacher development, academic enrichment, and bilingual education — shows the Los Angeles Unified School District, for example, received $62 million in the 2022-23 school year. Philadelphia’s school district got $28 million, while Miami’s got over $24 million. Smaller districts got more modest amounts, but they still would have represented sizable gaps in their budgets. For example, schools in Burlington, Vermont; Pine Bluff, Arkansas; and Norristown, Pennsylvania, each got more than $300 per student from the same three grant programs. ___ Associated Press writer Sharon Lurye in Philadelphia contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press’ education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

ServiceNow: The 2nd Wave of AI Spending Is Here,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/servicenow-the-2nd-wave-of-ai-spending-is-here/,"ServiceNow’s NYSE: NOW Q2 results and guidance update are a wow moment for investors and an eye-opener for those waiting on AI’s second wave. The second wave, the rise of agentic services and the application of AI, is expected to be a larger, faster-growing, and longer-sustained rally than infrastructure, which has been a rocket-ship of gains for technology investors. The takeaway today is that ServiceNow’s results outperformed guidance and analysts' consensus forecasts in all metrics. Guidance was improved to align with them, and the momentum indicates that outperformance is very likely. ServiceNow had a robust quarter considering its size. The megacap grew its revenue by 22.4% to over $3.2 billion, outperforming MarketBeat’s reported consensus by more than 300 basis points. The strength was driven by subscriptions and large clients, with subscription revenue up 22.5% and clients contributing more than $20 million in contract value, up 30%. Margin news is also good, with revenue leverage compounded by internal efficiency. The net result is that adjusted EPS grew by 30% compared to the 22.4% top-line growth and outperformed by an eye-popping margin. Outperformance topped 1450 basis points, and the strength is expected to continue in Q3 and the remainder of the year. The company raised its guidance for Q3, underpinning expectations for a strong year, forecasting about 20% growth compared to the prior year. The guidance is likely cautious, given the 22.4% top-line growth, accelerating deal volume, and improving quality, as well as the RPO, which outpaces revenue. The current remaining performance obligation is up 24.5%, and the total is up 29%, suggesting sustained, if not accelerating, growth as the year progresses. ServiceNow’s business is profitable, and it generates free cash flow. A portion is used to buy back shares, which is insufficient to offset dilution, but almost, and the remainder is for reinvestment. As of the end of Q2 2025, the company’s efforts resulted in increased cash and assets, steady net debt, low leverage, and increased equity. Equity improved by 13% YTD and will likely continue to grow as the year progresses. Regarding leverage, the company utilizes debt but has an investment-grade rating, resulting in relatively low costs. The net leverage in Q3 is about 0.1x the equity, which is a healthy ratio. Analysts are leading this market higher, providing support with increasing coverage, a firming sentiment, a Moderate Buy rating, and an uptrend in the consensus price target. The price target is a critical factor, having risen by more than 30% in the last year, with revisions leading to a high-end range. The high-end range is $1,300, affirmed by the post-release activity, which includes several price target increases issued within the first twelve hours. Likewise, the institutional trends are bullish. They own 87% of the stock and buy on balance every month in 2025, netting about $2 in shares for every $1 sold. ServiceNow’s stock price surged in the wake of the release but struggled to break through resistance at the top of the near-term range. Resistance at $1,050 may keep this market in check soon, but long-term trends suggest it won’t. Once crossed, the next target is near $1,150, and it may be reached quickly. Assuming that subsequent earnings reports align with the new guidance, analyst trends will remain bullish. New highs will be set, potentially reaching as high as the $1,300 level, representing a 30% gain.

Tractor Supply Revs Up on Forecast Hike and Bullish Signals,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/tractor-supply-revs-up-on-forecast-hike-and-bullish-signals/,"Tractor Supply Company’s NASDAQ: TSCO FQ2 earnings report affirmed the outlook for long-term share price increases, as indicated by the recent stock split. Due to their quality, stocks that split tend to trend higher over time, outperforming the broader market. Stock splits tend to happen with stocks whose prices have been trending higher to begin with. Uptrends are driven by business growth and improving shareholder value, so it only makes sense that the uptrend will continue afterward. Tractor Supply Company's uptrend is tied to store count growth, market penetration, and share gains as it leans into its Life Out Here strategy. Life Out Here serves underserved, less urbanized markets where the larger big-box stores are largely absent. Like other retailers, the company faces hurdles in 2025, but is navigating the environment effectively, generating ample cash flow to sustain its growth trajectory, maintain a healthy balance sheet, and return capital. Capital return is a critical factor for this investment. TSCO stock is a buy-and-hold investment whose price action is supported by numerous factors, none of which tend to produce vigorous share price increases; rather, it exhibits steady share price growth over time. They include steady, stable, profitable business growth, an attractive dividend with an annually increasing distribution, and share repurchases. The dividend is safe and reliable, accounting for 45% of the earnings outlook, and is on track for robust annual increases. The distribution growth rate isn’t robust but is sustainable in the mid-to-low single-digit range and outpacing inflation. The share repurchases are significant. The company tempered its outlook for buybacks, reducing the annual forecast slightly in mid-July 2025, but it remains on track to purchase up to $375 million, a sustainable pace. The full-year forecast is worth approximately 1.1% of the pre-release market closing market cap, a solid pace but slower than the 1.6% decline posted for the June quarter. Tractor Supply Company’s analyst trends were bullish leading into the release and are likely to continue strongly in the back half. They included numerous price target increases, leading to the high-end range, aiding a 15% split-adjusted YOY increase in MarketBeat’s reported consensus and providing lift for the market. The consensus estimate lags in early Q3 but is rising, and the high-end range is leading to new highs. The company achieved 4.5% revenue growth, outperforming the market by 100 basis points. It maintained strong margins and updated its guidance. Executives expect revenue growth of 4% to 8%, a wide range but one whose midpoint is well above the 4.7% consensus. Regarding earnings, the company also forecasted a wide range with a midpoint above the consensus. Following the release, the price action in TSCO was bullish, rising by more than 4% to a new high. The move reveals ample support within an eager market, with the trading set to hit its potential to continue higher. The move to new highs broke the market out of a trading range worth approximately $13, which puts the base-case target in the $74.50 to $75 range. It could be reached this year. The longer-term outlook is also bullish. The company remains on track to expand its store count and improve comparable sales over time. The analyst consensus forecasts mid-to-high single-digit revenue growth and high-single-digit to low-double-digit earnings growth for the subsequent nine years. This puts TSCO at roughly 11.5x its earnings outlook and in deep value territory.

3 Short Squeeze Candidates With Big Catalysts on the Horizon,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/3-short-squeeze-candidates-with-big-catalysts-on-the-horizon/,"In 2021, a new presidential administration took shape while meme stocks and short squeezes sent markets into a frenzy. In 2025, another new presidential administration is taking shape, while meme stocks and short squeezes again send markets into a frenzy. While history doesn’t always repeat, we might see it rhyme as obscure small-cap stocks produce parabolic gains on a wave of retail volume. The names are different (and it’s Superman leading the box office this time over Spider-Man), but it might be time to dust off the short squeeze trading playbook and consider a few lottery tickets. Hunting short squeezes is risky since these stocks are often thinly traded and highly volatile. Before buying any of the three stocks discussed here today, make sure this strategy fits with your investment goals. Short squeeze candidates are often terrible-looking investments at face value—that’s why so many investors are shorting! You don’t short profitable winners like NVIDIA Corp. NASDAQ: NVDA; instead, you short movie chains struggling to remain solvent, like AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. NYSE: AMC, or unprofitable tech firms, like Opendoor Technologies Inc. NASDAQ: OPEN. The idea behind a short squeeze isn’t a good long-term investment, but a quick parabolic gain as shorts race to cover. That’s why traders don’t look at fundamentals, but factors like these: Most heavily-shorted stocks don’t produce a squeeze, which is why finding a catalyst is a crucial part of due diligence. Nostalgia has drawn the AMC and GameStop crowds, but there needs to be a genuine reason for a reversal when hunting squeezes (as Gabriel highlights here for Opendoor). Here are three more candidates with high short interest and upcoming catalysts to keep on your radar. Shorting stocks in the semiconductor space is a bold decision considering the AI gold rush, but Navitas Semiconductor Corp. NASDAQ: NVTS currently sports 32% short interest on its 134 million share float. Shorts control about $385 million of the stock’s $1.72 billion market cap, which makes sense considering the company only generated $83 million in sales over the last 12 months and continues to post negative EPS. The company's Q1 revenue dropped nearly 40% year over year (YOY), but it did meet analyst expectations. The Q2 report is scheduled for August 4, and while expectations are low, an upside surprise could be the catalyst needed to trigger a squeeze. Red Cat Holdings Inc. NASDAQ: RCAT has seen short interest balloon lately, with 20% of the float now short, a 38% increase over the previous month. A poor Q1 earnings report is likely the culprit, as the company missed EPS expectations by a significant margin—a loss of 27 cents per share reported versus a 10-cent loss expected. However, the company expects to achieve profitability by the end of the year, and its drone capabilities have already sparked interest from the U.S. government. Regulatory tailwinds are at Red Cat’s back, and its next earnings report is scheduled for August 14. QuantumScape Corp. NYSE: QS only has 14% short interest, but that hasn’t stopped it from pumping out a 123% gain over the last month as the short squeeze trend reignited. The EV battery maker’s stock jumped 30% on a single day in June after announcing its new Cobra Separator Process. Since this development, regulatory headwinds for EVs have been introduced, but those were likely priced in as the stock soared again in July. Shares are down 14% this week as the rally takes a breather, but they received a price target boost from Robert Baird, which increased from $6 to $11, now the highest figure on the Street. Before you consider QuantumScape, you'll want to hear this.","Regulatory tailwinds are at Red Cat’s back, and its next earnings report is scheduled for August 14.","QuantumScape Corp.
