Mining stocks in Asia gain as hard-asset trade gathers pace,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/mining-stocks-in-asia-gain-as-hard-asset-trade-gathers-pace-13790369.html,"Asian mining stocks climbed with metals prices as investors rotated into hard assets, driven by a weakening dollar and growing unease over currencies, geopolitics and global fiscal risks. A group of materials producers led gains Monday on MSCI Inc.’s broadest index of Asia Pacific equities. Korea Zinc Co. shares climbed as much as 14% in Seoul while Zhongjin Gold Corp.’s jumped 10% in Shanghai. Markets were closed for holidays Monday in Australia and India. The advances mirror a powerful rally in metals markets, where gold, silver, copper and aluminum are climbing on what traders describe as a debasement trade. Investors are pulling away from currencies and Treasuries, seeking refuge in hard assets as concerns mount over fiscal largesse, geopolitics and the durability of US exceptionalism. The rally in metals “is a long term trend that we have been observing for several years,” said Frank Benzimra, head of Asia equity strategy at Societe Generale SA. Reasons include a diversification away from US assets and rising defense spending boosting demand for base metals as well as AI-related demand.","Investors are pulling away from currencies and Treasuries, seeking refuge in hard assets as concerns mount over fiscal largesse, geopolitics and the durability of US exceptionalism.","Investors are pulling away from currencies and Treasuries, seeking refuge in hard assets as concerns mount over fiscal largesse, geopolitics and the durability of US exceptionalism.","The rally in metals “is a long term trend that we have been observing for several years,” said Frank Benzimra, head of Asia equity strategy at Societe Generale SA.","Investors are pulling away from currencies and Treasuries, seeking refuge in hard assets as concerns mount over fiscal largesse, geopolitics and the durability of US exceptionalism."

Broader indices log biggest weekly decline in 4 months; over 200 small-caps see double-digit losses,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/broader-indices-log-biggest-weekly-decline-in-4-months-over-200-small-caps-see-double-digit-losses-13789275.html,"Broader indices fell 4–6 percent, logging their biggest weekly decline in four months and underperforming the benchmark indices amid mixed earnings from India Inc, continued foreign investor outflows, and the rupee hitting a fresh low. The BSE Sensex declined 769.67 points, or 2.43 percent, to close at 81,537.70, while the Nifty50 shed 241.25 points, or 2.51 percent, to end at 25,048.65. So far this month, the BSE Sensex and Nifty50 have each declined 4 percent, while the BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices have fallen 5.7 percent and 9 percent, respectively. All the sectoral indices gave negative return with Nifty Realty shed more than 11 percent, Nifty Consumer Durables index slipped 6.5 percent, Nifty Media plunged 4 percent, Nifty Oil & Gas, Energy, Infra, Defence, Healthcare fell 3 percent each. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) offloaded equities worth Rs 14,651.99 crore during the period, while Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) offset the selling with purchases worth Rs 20,746 crore. ""Indian equity markets remained cautious and volatile through the week, pressured by renewed global trade tensions and continued foreign investor outflows. Fresh U.S. tariff threats against European nations linked to the Greenland issue dampened global risk appetite, prompting a shift toward safe-haven assets. Moreover, rising global bond yields and uncertainty surrounding the U.S. Supreme Court’s review of Trump-era tariffs further restrained risk-taking,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments. ""Corporate earnings reinforced the mixed sentiment, as weaker results from leading banking and IT companies tempered market enthusiasm, although selective value buying offered intermittent support. While global cues briefly improved following constructive remarks from the U.S. President on the Greenland issue, the domestic market’s rebound was short-lived, highlighting the persistence of external headwinds for India."" ""Market direction in the coming week is likely to be driven by global macroeconomic signals and domestic fiscal expectations. Investors will closely track guidance from the Fed on the trajectory of interest rate cuts, while positioning may be influenced by anticipation surrounding the Union Budget, particularly any measures aimed at easing external trade pressures and supporting capital flows,"" Nair said. ""With the Q3 earnings season still underway, stock-specific movements are expected to remain prominent. Overall sentiment is likely to stay cautious, shaped by global developments, currency trends, and earnings outcomes, with selective opportunities emerging in segments supported by resilient domestic demand,"" he added.

Where is Nifty50 headed? Hitesh Tailor, Research Analyst, Choice Equity Broking The 81,000–81,100 zone is emerging as a crucial support area for the Sensex, acting as a cushion where dip-buying interest may surface if weakness deepens. On the upside, 82,000–82,100 stands as the immediate resistance band, where any short-term rebound is likely to encounter supply pressure and profit booking. With the index ending decisively below recent intermediate levels and broad-based selling dominating the session, the near-term bias remains cautious to bearish. Selective accumulation may be considered only if the key support zone holds and clear buying interest re-emerges."" Amol Athawale, VP – Technical Research We are of the view that as long as the market trades below the 100-day SMA or 25500/83000, the weak formation is likely to continue. On the downside, 24900/81100 would act as an immediate support zone. Below this level, selling pressure is likely to accelerate. Further below, the market could slip to 24700,–24,500/80500-80000. On the upside, above 25,200/82000, we could see a quick pullback up to 25,350–25,500/82500-83000. For Bank Nifty, 58,000 would act as a key level for traders. Below this, the correction wave is likely to continue until 57,500–57100. Conversely, above 59,000, it could bounce back up to 59,350–59,500.

"Dow ends lower after topsy-turvy week, as Intel's outlook weighs on market sentiment",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/dow-ends-lower-after-topsy-turvy-week-as-intel-s-outlook-weighs-on-market-sentiment-13789249.html,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down ​on Friday, while the S&P 500 ended largely unchanged, as investors' risk appetite was dimmed at the end of a topsy-turvy week ‌by Intel's plunge on a downbeat outlook. All three Wall Street benchmarks had rebounded in the past two sessions following Tuesday's sharp selloff triggered by U.S. President Donald Trump's threats to impose tariffs on European allies, an effort to pressure them to accept his claims to Greenland. On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 285.30 points, or 0.58%, to 49,098.71. The S&P 500 edged up 2.26 points, or 0.03%, to 6,915.61, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 65.23 points, or 0.28%, to 23,501.24. Even the Nasdaq's ‌Friday gains were not enough to rescue the benchmarks from having a down week, with the S&P 500 off by ​0.36%, the Dow lower by 0.53% and the Nasdaq slipping by 0.06%. Despite the week's limited pullback, investors appeared to remain confident that while geopolitical-induced volatility is a present danger, the overall state of the American economy continues to be robust. ""When we think about what it means from an investor's standpoint, we feel ‍pretty good about where we are today,"" said Jason Blackwell, chief investment strategist at Focus Partners Wealth. He noted that volatility was expected this year, given the midterms later in 2026. However, corporate earnings are expected to continue to come in strong, and the economy is going along fine. ""We're feeling pretty good, but mindful we might have some significant twists and ⁠turns throughout the rest of the year,"" Blackwell added. THE 'SHOW-ME' SEASON One twist on Friday, which weighed on market sentiment, was chipmaker Intel (INTC.O), opens new tab. Its shares sank 17% after the ‍company forecast quarterly revenue and profit below market estimates, saying it struggled to satisfy demand for its server chips used in AI data centers. With many technology and semiconductor companies ‌still trading ‌at sky-high valuations, 2026 is viewed by many as the year where the huge excitement for the artificial intelligence trend, and the huge amounts of capital expenditure to attain it, need to start showing up as corporate revenue. Julian McManus, portfolio manager on the Global Alpha Equity team at Janus Henderson, noted how last week's earnings from TSMC(2330.TW), opens new tab, the world's main producer of advanced AI chips, could portend well for the latest earnings from the space. “Going into results, we’re going to be ⁠in a ‘show-me’ period, where you have ⁠to actually put up the revenue ​growth to justify the run-up in stocks,” he said. “It’s going to be a period of the haves versus the have-nots, and I personally don’t see Intel being in the haves.” MAG 7 EARNINGS TEST This show-me point will be particularly pertinent for investors next week, with earnings on deck from many of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks, including Apple, Tesla ‍and Microsoft. On Friday, most of the megacaps rose, with Microsoft, Meta and Amazon up between 1.7% and 3.3%. Nvidia gained 1.5% after Bloomberg News reported Chinese officials have told Alibaba, Tencent tab and ByteDance they can prepare orders for Nvidia's H200 AI chips. Of the S&P sub-sectors, seven ended in positive territory, led by the 0.9% increase in materials. The energy index rose 0.6% on Friday, ​to its third successive record closing high. It was also the top performing sub-index for the ‍week, while its 10.1% advance so far in 2026 is unmatched. The number of shares changing hands on U.S. exchanges on Friday was 17.34 billion shares, compared with the 17.07 billion average over ​the last 20 trading days.","“Going into results, we’re going to be ⁠in a ‘show-me’ period, where you have ⁠to actually put up the revenue ​growth to justify the run-up in stocks,” he said.","The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down ​on Friday, while the S&P 500 ended largely unchanged, as investors' risk appetite was dimmed at the end of a topsy-turvy week ‌by Intel's plunge on a downbeat outlook.","He noted that volatility was expected this year, given the midterms later in 2026.","“It’s going to be a period of the haves versus the have-nots, and I personally don’t see Intel being in the haves.” MAG 7 EARNINGS TEST This show-me point will be particularly pertinent for investors next week, with earnings on deck from many of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks, including Apple, Tesla ‍and Microsoft."

"Cipla takes wait‑and‑watch call on weight loss generic semaglutide, to focus on tirzepatide",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/cipla-takes-wait-and-watch-call-on-weight-loss-generic-semaglutide-to-focus-on-tirzepatide-13788957.html,"Cipla Ltd. on Friday said it will take a “wait‑and‑watch” approach on entering the diabetes and weight loss therapy semaglutide market even as rivals prepare for generic launches, as the company prioritises its partnership with Eli Lilly for tirzepatide, which it considers the superior obesity and diabetes therapy. “Our current focus remains on tirzepatide in terms of being the best‑in‑class molecule,” said Achin Gupta, Cipla’s Managing Director and Global CEO (Designate). “We have possibilities to explore on Sema (semaglutide), but we would rather wait and watch and see how the market plays out, especially at lower price points once genericisation happens.” Cipla launched Yurpeak (tirzepatide) in India under a partnership with Eli Lilly to treat type 2 diabetes and chronic weight management. Eli Lilly manufactures and supplies the product, while Cipla manages marketing and distribution. Cipla is working on expanding the coverage beyond major cities, with pricing in line with Mounjaro. “Yurpeak is a massive opportunity for us,” Gupta said. “Since we believe that is the best‑in‑class product out there and is under patent for a long time, at the moment we’re focusing maximum energies on that.” In its first month (December 2025), the Yurpeak has recorded sales of Rs.14 crore, performing well in tier-2 and 3 markets. Cipla decision to go slow on semaglutide, contrast with rivals Dr.Reddy's and Sun Pharma, who got regulatory approval in India for launching generic versions of semaglutide. Both companies announced that they will be launching generic Ozempic in March, following the patent expiry of the drug. Analysts expect the generic would be cheaper by 50-60 percent than branded drug. US dragged by lenalidomide cliff, lanreotide supply issues The drugmaker posted a lacklustre performance in its US business due to a sharp drop in anti-cancer generic lenalidomide sales and supply disruptions in lanreotide. Cipla’s North America, which consists largely US, reported around 26% drop YoY to $167 million in Q3FY26, as lenalidomide contributions dwindled sharply and lanreotide supplies were disrupted after an USFDA audit hit its partner Pharmathen. Gupta acknowledged the drag openly. “We had a small contribution from lenalidomide in Q3, and lanreotide faced supply challenges following the USFDA audit of our partner,” he said. “In the meantime, the product will be in limited supplies… but we are working on enabling an alternate site together with the partner.” The supply issues will spill into next quarter as well, the company said. Gupta described US performance as a “temporary” setback that will be offset by upcoming high‑value launches, particularly in respiratory and peptides. “There are two respiratory assets where we believe we could have a sole‑generic opportunity, and these are pretty sizable,” he said. “Our pipeline gives us the confidence to offset lenalidomide and deliver strong growth.” Complex generics over volume play Cipla plans to lean further into complex, high‑margin launches — including long‑acting injectables and peptides — to rebuild momentum in the US. “We focus a lot on the value and complexity of launches rather than the number of filings,” Gupta said. “This will help us make up for the loss.” He reiterated that filgrastim in the US is a “small entry” and more of a capability‑building step in biosimilars.","US dragged by lenalidomide cliff, lanreotide supply issues The drugmaker posted a lacklustre performance in its US business due to a sharp drop in anti-cancer generic lenalidomide sales and supply disruptions in lanreotide.","Cipla Ltd. on Friday said it will take a “wait‑and‑watch” approach on entering the diabetes and weight loss therapy semaglutide market even as rivals prepare for generic launches, as the company prioritises its partnership with Eli Lilly for tirzepatide, which it considers the superior obesity and diabetes therapy.","Cipla’s North America, which consists largely US, reported around 26% drop YoY to $167 million in Q3FY26, as lenalidomide contributions dwindled sharply and lanreotide supplies were disrupted after an USFDA audit hit its partner Pharmathen.","“In the meantime, the product will be in limited supplies… but we are working on enabling an alternate site together with the partner.” The supply issues will spill into next quarter as well, the company said."

Click to View More Outlook for January 27 Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The index remained weak throughout the session as it stayed below the 20 EMA on the hourly chart. In addition, the index has finally slipped below the 200 DMA on a closing basis, suggesting capitulation by the bulls after a futile attempt to defend the crucial long-term moving average. As a result, short- to medium-term sentiment is likely to remain weak as long as the index trades below 25,500. On the downside, the decline could extend toward 24,700 in the short term. Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets remained volatile and declined nearly one percent, resuming the prevailing corrective trend. The Nifty index opened in positive territory on easing geopolitical tensions but soon gave up its gains and drifted lower amid persistent selling pressure, eventually settling near the day’s low at 25,048.65. Selling was broad-based, with realty, energy and banking stocks among the key laggards, while only a few defensive and select cyclical names provided limited support. Broader market indices also mirrored the weakness, with midcap and smallcap indices falling close to two percent each, highlighting widespread risk-off positioning and cautious participation. Market sentiment was weighed down by renewed concerns over global trade and geopolitical developments, along with continued foreign institutional selling. Currency weakness further added to the negative bias, as the Indian rupee slipped to fresh lows against the US dollar during the session. In the absence of strong domestic triggers, trading remained largely stock-specific, marked by selective buying and pronounced selling across the broader market. Technically, the Nifty has slipped below its long-term moving average, the 200 DEMA, which signals the possibility of further downside. The 24,750–24,900 zone now emerges as the next key support area, while the 25,300–25,400 zone is likely to act as an immediate hurdle in case of any rebound. That said, select pockets continue to show resilience and are offering buying opportunities. In this environment, participants are advised to maintain a selective and balanced approach, take positions on both sides based on sectoral strength and weakness, and keep a strict check on position sizing. Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities After showing a bounce back in the last couple of sessions, Nifty slipped into sharp weakness on Friday and closed the day lower by 241 points. After opening on a positive note, the market was not able to sustain the opening gains and started with weakness since early part of the session. The weakness got intensified in the mid to later part and Nifty finally closed at the lows. A long bear candle was formed on the daily chart which indicates a formation of lower top reversal pattern at the recent swing highs of 25400 levels. Nifty on the weekly chart formed a long bear candle this week after the minor bounce of last week.

Zee5 turned EBITDA positive this quarter, reporting EBITDA of INR 564mn. Other sales and services grew 6x YoY, driven by distribution income from Kantara 2 and Akhanda 2. TV market share gain of 60bps YoY remained a key positive for the linear TV segment. Advertising revenue declined 9% YoY, primarily due to continued FMCG softness, though it improved 6% QoQ. Management expects advertising recovery to be gradual driven by GST cuts and a pickup in brand-building initiatives by FMCG players. While the stock remains inexpensive at current market prices, we believe a tangible recovery in advertising income is crucial for re-rating. Outlook We maintain BUY with a revised TP of INR 120 (INR 185), based on an 18x one-year forward P/E multiple (FY27E).

Paytm shares fall 10% to see biggest single-day fall in over one year. Is this RBI decision to be blamed?,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/paytm-shares-fall-10-to-see-biggest-single-day-fall-in-over-one-year-is-this-rbi-decision-to-be-blamed-13788191.html,"The shares of Paytm dropped nearly 10 percent on January 23, falling to a three-month low level. The stock has now fallen around 15 percent in the past five days. The shares of the fintech platform dropped to Rs 1,134.50 apiece, the lowest level seen since October 1 last year. The stock has now recorded the worst single-day drop since January 2025. Why are Paytm shares falling today? One of the reasons why Paytm shares saw strong downturn today could be concerns around Payment Infrastructure Development Fund (PIDF) that was extended until December 2025, according to CNBC-TV18. The initiative by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) aimed to encourage deployment of digital payments acceptance infrastructure like soundboxes and POS devices, through incentives. Notably there has been no update yet as to whether the scheme will be extended beyond 2025. Paytm can see an impact of nearly Rs 200 crore in annualised operating revenue if the scheme is not extended, a hit that would directly impact the fintech giant’s EBITDA, NDTV Profit reported. Here's what Paytm said: After the shares saw strong volatility following the reports, Paytm issued a clarification. It said that it received Rs 128 crore as incentive under the scheme for the six months ended September 30, 2025. Paytm acknowledged that no announcement regarding the extension of the scheme has been made yet. ""In the scenario that the current Scheme is not extended or replaced, we expect to significantly offset the impact over time through a combination of higher revenues and more targeted sales efforts,"" it added. Paytm quarterly results: Paytm is set to release its results for the October-December quarter (Q3) of the ongoing financial year 2026 on January 29. Earlier in November, Paytm reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 21 crore for the quarter ended September 2025 (Q2 FY26), marking a sharp decline from Rs 930 crore in the same period last year due to a one-time gain of Rs 1,345 crore in the base quarter. Revenue from operations rose 24 percent year-on-year to Rs 2,061 crore and 7 percent higher quarter-on-quarter from Rs 1,918 crore in Q1 FY26, driven by sustained growth in financial services and merchant payments. Paytm share price: Paytm shares have declined more than 16 percent in the past one month, but gained over 7 percent in the past six months. This comes after the stock gained over 34 percent in the past one year.

"Real estate stocks see biggest weekly drop in 11 months, led by DLF, Anant Raj; Nuvama flags weak pre-sales as concern",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/real-estate-stocks-see-biggest-weekly-drop-in-11-months-led-by-dlf-anant-raj-nuvama-flags-weak-pre-sales-as-concern-13787910.html,"Shares of real estate firms recorded their steepest weekly fall in about 11 months, weighed down by concerns over housing sales, with stocks such as Anant Raj, DLF among others leading the decline. The Nifty Realty index fell 9.2 percent this week, marking its biggest weekly drop in about 11 months. The index slipped up to 3 percent during intra-day trade on Friday and has declined in 12 of the last 13 sessions. It rose marginally by 0.3 percent in only one session during this period, on January 16. In Friday’s session, nine of the 10 constituents of the index were trading in the red, with Sobha Ltd being the lone gainer. Anant Raj shares fell as much as 6 percent, while Lodha Developers, Godrej Properties, DLF and Oberoi Realty declined up to 5 percent. On a weekly basis, Godrej Properties and Lodha Developers dropped 15.3 percent and 13.5 percent, respectively. Brigade Enterprises fell 9.3 percent, Oberoi Realty declined 11.3 percent and Sobha Ltd lost 12.3 percent. ""Rationalisation of home loan interest benefits, continued focus on infrastructure spending, and incentives for affordable and mid-income housing will go a long way in boosting buyer confidence. A stable tax framework and support for sustainable construction will also help developers deliver quality projects while aligning with long-term urban growth goals,"" Umang Jindal, CEO, Homeland Group added. Global brokerage Nuvama said housing sales value declined 6 percent year-on-year in the December quarter, the steepest fall since the upcycle began in 2021. While noting that the Indian real estate sector has seen strong growth since 2021 after years of stagnation, the brokerage maintained a ‘neutral’ stance on housing stocks despite the recent correction. Nuvama said the correction could continue amid concerns over pre-sales growth. It added that housing volumes are likely to remain soft until developers reduce their focus on the luxury segment and shift towards mid-income and premium housing, while also working to improve affordability by keeping prices and ticket sizes in check. The brokerage said companies with a sizeable annuity portfolio are likely to perform better on a relative basis, and named Prestige Estates Projects as its top pick. Deepak Kapoor, Director, Gulshan Group, said ""Housing developments that are quality-led and design-intensive operate on longer gestation cycles with higher capital commitment than mass housing. Granting real estate industry status will improve access to structured financing, enhance investor confidence, and enable the sector’s progression towards global standards and long-term value creation."" Meanwhile, realty major DLF Ltd reported a 16 percent decline in sales bookings to Rs 16,176 crore in the first nine months of the current fiscal due to lower new home supply. The company, however, said it remains confident of meeting its annual pre-sales target. DLF, the country’s largest real estate company by market capitalisation, had recorded sales bookings of Rs 19,187 crore in the year-ago period. According to an investor presentation, the company’s sales bookings fell sharply to Rs 419 crore in the December quarter from a record Rs 12,039 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year. Explaining the sharp decline, DLF said new bookings for its ultra-luxury housing project ‘Dahlias’ were on hold during the December quarter due to a redesign aimed at enhancing customer experience.

Bandhan Bank shares jump 6% as brokerages remain bullish despite 52% fall in Q3 net profit; here's why,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/bandhan-bank-shares-jump-6-as-brokerages-remain-bullish-despite-52-fall-in-q3-net-profit-here-s-why-13787862.html,"The shares of Bandhan Bank jumped around 6 percent on January 23 after the lender released its results for the October-December quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026. Brokerages remain bullish on the stock, citing several reasons. Bandhan Bank shares rose to a one-month high of Rs 151.25 apiece in the morning trading hours of Friday. The company had released its Q3 FY26 results in the post-market hours of Thursday. Bandhan Bank Q3 Results: Bandhan Bank reported a net profit of Rs 205.59 crore for the third quarter of FY26, marking a 52 percent year-on-year (YoY) fall from the Rs 426.49 crore net profit reported in the same quarter of the previous financial year. Sequentially however, the lender’s net profit surged around 84 percent QoQ from Rs 111.87 crore reported in the previous quarter (Q2 FY26). Bandhan Bank’s net interest income meanwhile fell around 4.5 percent YoY to Rs 2,688.30 crore during the quarter under review. Asset quality improved, with gross NPA ratio falling to 3.33 percent in Q3 FY26, from 4.68 percent in Q3 FY25 and 5.02 percent in Q2 FY26. Deposits grew 11 percent YoY to Rs 1.57 lakh crore, while gross advances rose 10 percent YoY to Rs 1.45 lakh crore. Net interest margin (NIM) for the quarter stood at 5.9 percent. Motilal Oswal upgrades Bandhan Bank shares: Motilal Oswal upgraded Bandhan Bank shares to ‘Buy’, with a target price of Rs 175 per share. This implies an upside potential of nearly 23 percent from the stock’s previous closing price of Rs 142.46 apiece. The domestic brokerage said that the firm’s Q3 results were more or less in line with estimates. “Bandhan has undergone a long-drawn NPA cycle, which significantly impacted its growth and profitability profile. As a result, the bank delivered a tepid 8% avg. RoE over the past five years,” it said. Motilal expects the bank’s operating performance to recover in the coming quarters, with asset quality regaining normalcy and margins stabilizing. JM Financial upgrades Bandhan Bank shares: JM Financial noted that the company’s net profit missed its estimate despite strong operating performance, primarily due to elevated credit cost which was expected to moderate during the quarter following the NPA sale. However, given the current valuation of 0.7xFY28 P/B, JM Financial feels that the downside potential in the stock looks limited. Hence, the domestic brokerage upgraded the stock to ‘Add’, and increased its target price to Rs 160 apiece. This implies an upside potential of more than 12 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. UBS expects NIM to improve further: UBS said that the company’s Q3 profit missed its estimates due to higher provisions, despite sequential improvement in key metrics. It expects NIM to improve further and slippages to sustain decline. The international brokerage kept a ‘Neutral’ call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 180 per share. This implies an upside potential of more than 26 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. CLSA on Bandhan Bank: CLSA said that Bandhan Bank’s margin largely remained stable, marking a relief after two quarters of sharp decline. AUM growth picked up to 8 percent YoY from 6 percent YoY. The international brokerage kept an ‘Outperform’ rating on the stock, with a target price of Rs 190 per share. This implies an upside potential of more than 33 percent from the previous closing price. Nomura on Bandhan Bank: Nomura kept a ‘Neutral’ call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 160 per share. It noted that Bandhan Bank’s asset quality recovery lagged peers in Q3FY26 However, it noted that the stock trades at inexpensive valuation of 0.8x FY27 BVPS.

This performance largely reflects the completion of a large, cyclical defense order in FY25, though the Aerospace, Industrial, and Med-Tech segments showed healthy YoY growth. While revenue was soft due to temporary shipment ""push outs"" related to year-end holidays and US tariff uncertainty, management reported a record order backlog of INR 23.5 billion and a strong YTD bookto-bill ratio of 1.56x, indicating robust demand and visibility for a stronger Q4 and FY27. EBITDA stood at INR 275 mn, down 2.3% YoY and 11.9% QoQ, and missed our estimate of INR 350 mn. EBITDA margin came in at 9.1% (down 98 bps QoQ, up 273 bps YoY) but was 144 bps below our estimate of 10.5%, indicating weaker operating leverage and higher cost absorption pressures during the quarter. Reported PAT came in at INR 112 mn, up 2.2% YoY but down 65.1% QoQ, and missed our estimate. The sharp QoQ decline was primarily due to a steep fall in other income (INR 43 mn vs INR 227 mn in Q2), which had benefited from one-offs.

Buy Mphasis; target of Rs 3480: Prabhudas Lilladher,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-mphasis-target-of-rs-3480-prabhudas-lilladher-13787704.html,"Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Mphasis The revenue growth performance (+1.5% QoQ CC) exceeded our estimates (+0.5% QoQ CC), attributed to steady revenue conversion and timely ramp up of large deals. Despite furloughs the BFSI performance was healthy (+3.7% QoQ). The performance beyond BFSI was weak due to seasonality in TMT, while Logistics has reached steady state and was muted QoQ. Ex-logistics & Transportation, the company has reported ~16% YoY growth over 9MFY26. The company’s recalibrated approach to introduce platforms + service delivery, while infusing human-agent model, drives incremental engagement to strategic transformation deals. The large transformation deals have increased to 14 in 9MFY26 (vs 11 deals in 9MFY25). The new deal TCV at USD428m (up 22% YoY) translates to USD 1.7bn 9MFY26 deal TCV (+95% YoY). On margins, the company has maintained a narrow band despite the drop in Q3 effort utilization. Developing platforms and IPs would be a continued effort and hence keep margins within a guided band (14.75%-15.75%). We are baking revenue growth of 7.0%/9.2%/10.7 YoY CC with EBIT margin of 15.3%/15.7%/16.0% for FY26E/FY27E/FY28E. Outlook We assign 26x to FY28E EPS that translates a TP of 3,480. Maintain BUY.

"Gold, silver ETFs rise up to 30% from Thursday's lows as record precious metal rally extends: Should you buy here?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/gold-silver-etfs-rise-30-from-thursday-s-lows-as-record-precious-metal-rally-extends-should-investors-buy-here-13787569.html,"Gold and silver exchange traded funds (ETFs) rebounded sharply on January 23, recovering strong losses which were recorded earlier yesterday. Experts have commented on whether the rally in the precious metals will continue, and what lies ahead. Notably, today’s sharp recovery in ETFs come as precious metals soared to fresh all-time highs. The ETFs however are still away from their 52-week highs, which they had hit a day before yesterday before taking a breather from the rally. Tata Silver ETF, which had crashed up to 24 percent yesterday, hitting a low of Rs 25.56 apiece. The ETF rebounded sharply today, rising more than 17 percent to hit the day’s high at Rs 33 apiece. This marks a 29 percent jump from the low hit by the ETF earlier yesterday. Groww Gold ETF is currently the top gainer among all the gold ETFs. The ETFs jumped 7 percent to trade at Rs 155.97 apiece today. The sharp surge in gold and silver ETFs is a clear reflection of how aggressively investors are repositioning toward safe-haven assets amid heightened global uncertainty, said Justin Khoo, Senior Market Analyst - APAC, VT Market. Should you buy ETFs now? Speaking about yesterday's crash, Prasenjit Paul, Equity Research Analyst at Paul Asset & Fund Manager at 129 Wealth Fund said that what unsettles investors on days like yesterday is not the fall in gold or silver, but the illusion of stability that ETFs create. “Precious metals are volatile assets, ETFs make them feel tradable like stocks, encouraging investors to react to daily price moves. The real risk is owning them without clarity on allocation or purpose or without a proper entry-exit plan,” he explained. Precious metals experienced sharp volatility in late December 2025 and early January 2026. Despite price swings, the fundamentals of precious metals are compelling, driven by near-record industrial demand from solar panels, electric vehicles and AI infrastructure, said Tanvi Kanchan, Associate Director at Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers. “Given the current geopolitical landscape—from ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine to U.S.-China tensions and uncertainty around trade policies under the new Trump administration—precious metals maintain their relevance as portfolio hedges. However, after such explosive gains in 2025, timing a single-entry point is treacherous,” the analyst said. According to Kanchan, investors should consider spreading purchases over the coming weeks or months, instead of deploying capital all at once. For conservative investors, allocating 5-10% of portfolios to precious metals ETFs through systematic purchases reduces timing risk while maintaining exposure to an asset class that benefits from geopolitical instability and monetary policy uncertainty, she said. While the momentum remains intact, such elevated levels also increase the risk of short-term volatility and profit-taking, cautioned Khoo. The analyst added that ETF demand still suggests investor conviction in precious metals as a strategic hedge remains robust. Gold or silver? Motilal Oswal believes the gold looks more favourable now, after silver's massive rally. ""Silver has delivered sharp outperformance in a short span, and with the gold–silver ratio now near lower levels, the near-term risk-reward is turning more favourable for gold. While we remain positive on both metals and silver continues to have long-term upside backed by industrial demand and tight physical market conditions, the recent rally has also increased near-term volatility,"" said Navneet Damani, Head of Research Commodities and Manav Modi, Commodities Analyst, Motilal Oswal Financial Services. The analyst said that in this phase, a higher allocation to gold can help manage fluctuations while staying invested in precious metals.

"Gold, silver ETFs rebound up to 17% a day after crash as precious metals hit new highs: What lies ahead?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/gold-silver-etfs-rebound-up-to-10-a-day-after-crash-as-precious-metals-hit-new-highs-what-lies-ahead-13787468.html,"Gold and silver exchange traded funds (ETFs) rebounded sharply on January 23, rising as much as 17 percent as the precious metals regained ground after some correction. This comes a day after the ETFs crashed significantly following a record rally, as tariff concerns eased. While the ETFs are still away from their recent highs, the precious metals surged to fresh lifetime highs. Precious metals hit fresh all-time highs: Gold futures with February expiry on MCX hit fresh all time high of Rs 1,59,226 per 10 grams. The contracts with April and June expiries also hit lifetime highs at Rs 1,68,000 per 10 grams and Rs 1,73,676 per 10 grams, respectively. Silver futures with March expiry jumped to a fresh all time high of Rs 3,39,927 per kilogram. The contracts with May and July expiries were also at all-time high levels. This comes after the contracts fell around 4 percent yesterday. COMEX silver contract neared $100 per ounce and the gold contract neared $5,000 per ounce, as geopolitical tensions lingered even as US President Donald Trump walked back on his threats of imposing tariffs on European Union nations in his push to acquire Greenland. The commodity prices also rose as the US dollar remained weak. The dollar remained down on Friday, to record its worst week so far in a year, after falling the most in a month in the US trading session. A weaker dollar makes dollar-denominated commodities such as gold cheaper for those holding other currencies, aiding demand. The safe-haven demand for both precious metals continued to rise amid uncertainty around the Greenland issue despite Trump's statements about working towards a future deal. Details of the ""framework"" of the deal have been hazy, and European officials on Thursday appeared to be willing to talk about it only in vague terms, Dow Jones reported. European Union leaders met for a summit late on Thursday after Trump stepped back from his threat to impose new tariffs over Greenland, Blomberg reported. While Trump's step back has removed the immediate threat to European economic and geopolitical sovereignty, leaders are beginning to sift through the longer-term implications, the report said. During the summit, European leaders said they wanted an EU-US trade deal to be back on track after the European Parliament suspended its ratification in protest over Trump's threats. However, Trump's threats shook Europe's confidence in its partner, Reuters reported, quoting EU officials and leaders as saying. ""Transatlantic relations have definitely taken a big blow over the last ‌week,"" the report quoted the bloc's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas as saying. While saying ‌they want to work on strengthening transatlantic cooperation, the EU leaders warned that they were ready to act if Trump was to threaten them again, the report said. Gold ETFs: Groww Gold ETF, Invesco India Gold ETF, Motilal Oswal Gold ETF and Axis Gold ETF climbed around 4 percent each, while 360 ONE Gold ETF, Bandhan Gold ETF, Tata Gold ETF, Angel One Gold ETF, Zerodha Gold ETF, Quantum Gold ETF, ICICI Prudential Gold ETF, Edelweiss Gold ETF and Union Gold ETF meanwhile gained more than 3 percent each. LIC Mutual Fund Gold ETF, Nippon Gold ETF, Nippon India ETF Gold Bees, HDFC Gold ETF and others meanwhile gained around 3 percent each. Silver ETFs: 360 ONE Silver ETF was the top gainer, jumping more than 10 percent, while Tata Silver ETF, which had crashed up to 24 percent yesterday, jumped 9 percent today. Mirae Asset Silver ETF, Axis Silver ETF, Edelweiss Silver ETF, Aditya Birla Sun Life Silver ETF, DSP Silver ETF, ICICI Prudential Silver ETF and others gained around 9 percent each. Nippon India Silver ETF, HDFC Silver ETF, Zerodha Silver ETF and others gained more than 8 percent each. What lies ahead? Despite price swings, the fundamentals of the precious metals are compelling, driven by near-record industrial demand from solar panels, electric vehicles and AI infrastructure, said Tanvi Kanchan, Associate Director, Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers. ""Rather than deploying capital all at once, investors should consider spreading purchases over the coming weeks or months. This approach captures the dip while protecting against further corrections that could see silver test,"" the analyst said. ""For conservative investors, allocating 5-10% of portfolios to precious metals ETFs through systematic purchases reduces timing risk while maintaining exposure to an asset class that benefits from geopolitical instability and monetary policy uncertainty. The structural deficits and industrial demand provide a floor, but expect continued volatility as the market digests 2025's historic run,"" she added. The sharp surge in gold and silver ETFs is a clear reflection of how aggressively investors are repositioning toward safe-haven assets amid heightened global uncertainty, said Justin Khoo, Senior Market Analyst - APAC, VT Market. ""Gold prices trading near $4,950–$4,970 per ounce on COMEX, while silver rallies close to $99 per ounce, have pushed both metals firmly into record territory. This strength is being reinforced by a softer US dollar, persistent geopolitical tensions, and growing concerns around currency stability, all of which are driving strong ETF inflows as investors prefer liquid, regulated exposure. The move is equally striking, with gold prices approaching ₹1.6 lakh per 10 grams and silver nearing ₹3.5 lakh per kg, underscoring the global nature of the rally,"" the analyst said. While the momentum remains intact, such elevated levels also increase the risk of short-term volatility and profit-taking, Khoo said, adding that ETF demand still suggests investor conviction in precious metals as a strategic hedge remains robust.

"IndiGo share price falls nearly 2% in early trade after Q3 results, even as analysts bullish on stock",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/interglobe-aviation-shares-fall-nearly-2-in-early-trade-after-q3-results-even-as-analysts-bullish-on-stock-13787083.html,"Shares of IndiGo operator InterGlobe Aviation Ltd slipped in early trade on Friday with the stock down 1.96 percent at Rs 4,813, a day after the company reported its Q3 FY26 financial results. The airline’s market capitalisation stood at about Rs 1.86 lakh crore. The decline comes after InterGlobe Aviation disclosed a sharp year-on-year fall in reported net profit for the December quarter, weighed down by sizeable one-time exceptional items linked to the implementation of new labour codes and operational disruption during early December. The company had said these exceptional charges materially impacted headline profitability, even as revenue growth and operational metrics remained steady. However, brokerages largely looked past the headline profit decline, maintaining Buy ratings on the stock and reiterating confidence in IndiGo’s underlying business. UBS said the quarter was a “decent show despite disruptions”, noting that management expects capacity growth of around 10 percent year-on-year in Q4 FY26, led largely by international expansion. UBS also flagged guidance for higher costs in the March quarter but said yields are expected to moderate only gradually from a strong base. Citi said the Q3 financial impact of the FDTL-related disruption was lower than its estimates, with yields coming in better than expected and operational parameters broadly in line. Goldman Sachs said reported profit before tax was above estimates, adding that costs excluding forex, particularly aircraft rentals, were lower than anticipated, while management reiterated guidance of around 10 percent ASK growth in Q4, driven mainly by international operations. InterGlobe Aviation stock had closed at Rs 4,929 on Thursday ahead of the results, having gained over 19 percent in the past one year, outperforming the benchmark Nifty 50.

Should you buy or sell IndiGo shares after Q3 profit hit by one-offs? Brokerages bullish; check target prices,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/should-you-buy-or-sell-indigo-shares-after-q3-profit-hit-by-one-offs-brokerages-bullish-check-target-prices-13787022.html,"Brokerages have largely maintained a bullish stance on IndiGo parent InterGlobe Aviation despite a sharp headline drop in Q3 FY26 net profit, arguing that the earnings impact was driven by one-time disruptions and regulatory changes rather than any deterioration in the airline’s underlying business. InterGlobe Aviation reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 549.8 crore for the fiscal third quarter, down 77.5 percent year-on-year, weighed down by exceptional charges linked to the implementation of new labour codes and operational disruption during early December. Excluding exceptional items and forex impact, underlying profitability remained healthy, brokerages said in their post-results assessments. Ahead of the quarterly results, InterGlobe Aviation shares rose 1.47 percent to end at Rs 4,929 on NSE on Thursday. The stock is up about 19 percent over the past year, outperforming the benchmark Nifty 50. InterGlobe Aviation stock call: Brokerages positive on growth narrative UBS reiterated its ‘Buy’ rating on IndiGo stock with a target price of Rs 6,170 per share, implying an upside of over 25 percent. UBS said that while the near-term outlook remains soft, medium- to long-term fundamentals are intact. The brokerage said the October-December quarter performance was “decent despite disruptions”, adding that management’s guidance of around 10 percent capacity growth in Q4 FY26 -- largely led by international expansion -- supports the growth narrative. It flagged higher cost guidance for the January-March quarter, but said yields are expected to moderate only gradually from a strong base. Citi also retained a ‘Buy’ call with a target of Rs 5,700, stating that the financial impact of the FDTL-related disruption was lower than its estimates and that operational metrics were broadly in line. Citi highlighted better-than-expected yields and said IndiGo’s operations are normalising, with market share remaining strong and international route expansion continuing. Goldman Sachs maintained its ‘Buy’ rating with a target price of Rs 6,000, noting that reported profit before tax came in above expectations despite exceptional costs. Goldman said costs excluding forex, particularly aircraft rentals, were lower than anticipated, while yields and ticketing RASK were largely in line with estimates. It also pointed to management’s guidance of around 10 percent year-on-year ASK growth in Q4, driven mainly by international operations. Operationally, while brokerages acknowledged the impact of December’s disruptions and the regulatory reset, they underlined IndiGo’s strong balance sheet, scale advantage and execution track record. With cash balances remaining robust and capacity growth set to resume in the fiscal fourth quarter, analysts broadly see the Q3 setback as transitory rather than structural.

The breakout was supported by robust volume participation. Currently retesting the breakout zone, the stock formed a strong dragonfly doji, signalling that the throwback is likely complete and upside resumption is imminent.

Since then, it has maintained a downtrend with lower highs and lower lows inside a sloping channel. Wednesday confirmed a breakdown below the channel. The price trades well below medium- and long-term moving averages. On shorter timeframes, it broke down from a bearish flag-and-pole pattern, suggesting potential for accelerated downside momentum. Sell at CMP and add shorts on rises up to Rs 5,950. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 5,250, Rs 5,090 Stop-Loss: Rs 6,326 Om Mehra, Technical Research Analyst at Samco Securities Steel Authority of India | CMP: Rs 151.65 SAIL has resumed its upward trajectory after a brief consolidation and is now holding above the Rs 150 level, which had earlier acted as a minor hurdle. The stock is trading comfortably above its short-term moving averages and is respecting the rising VWAP (volume-weighted average price), which has acted as a reliable support during recent pullbacks. The stock is stabilising above the mid-Bollinger band and is attempting to move back toward the upper range. The daily RSI is placed near 61, indicating sustained strength. The MACD continues to remain in positive territory, although momentum has moderated slightly. Volumes have improved during the recent up move, reflecting renewed participation after the pullback. The near-term outlook remains favourable as long as the stock holds above the Rs 146 support area. A sustained move above the Rs 154 level could open the path for further upside. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 165 Stop-Loss: Rs 144 Jammu and Kashmir Bank | CMP: Rs 107.09 J&K Bank has witnessed a sharp revival after a brief corrective phase and is now trading firmly above the Rs 105–106 zone, which had earlier acted as immediate resistance. The stock has maintained its position above all key moving averages, reflecting a strong rebound. The latest session marked a decisive move higher with an open-low formation, highlighting sustained strength. The daily RSI is placed near 62 and has moved back into the higher zone, indicating improving momentum. The MACD has turned positive, with the histogram expanding on the upside. Volumes have expanded meaningfully during the breakout. The near-term outlook remains positive as long as the stock holds above the Rs 102–103 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 118 Stop-Loss: Rs 101 Gland Pharma | CMP: Rs 1,723.3 Gland Pharma is showing early signs of stabilisation after a prolonged decline and is now forming a base in the Rs 1,650–1,670 zone. The daily chart indicates a double-bottom formation, with the stock gradually moving higher from recent lows. The stock is trading above the 20-day and 50-day SMAs. A positive divergence is visible in the daily RSI, which is placed near the 53 level. The MACD remains below the zero line but is trending upward, indicating that the recovery is still in its early phase. Volumes remain on the lower side but have shown slight improvement over the last few sessions, which is typically seen when a stock begins to build a base. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,850 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,655 Aakash Shah, Research Analyst at Choice Broking Indian Bank | CMP: Rs 896.75 Indian Bank is trading at all-time high levels, highlighting strong bullish dominance and sustained institutional participation. The stock remains in a well-defined uptrend, with price action consistently forming higher highs and higher lows, indicating strength rather than exhaustion. On the daily chart, the all-time-high breakout indicates strong demand, as there is no overhead supply pressure. The breakout is supported by a strong bullish candle, reflecting confident buying interest. From a moving-average perspective, the stock is trading well above the key EMAs, all of which are positively aligned and sloping upward. The 20 EMA continues to act as a reliable dynamic support, with every minor pullback being absorbed quickly, reinforcing the strength of the trend. Structurally, the Rs 855 zone now acts as a strong demand and support area. As long as the price sustains above this region, the bullish structure remains intact. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 950 Stop-Loss: Rs 855 Bharat Electronics | CMP: Rs 417.3 Bharat Electronics is showing signs of a bullish consolidation breakout setup within a broader uptrend. After an extended rally, the stock entered a brief consolidation phase and is now attempting to resume its upward move. On the daily chart, price action reflects a higher-low structure, with the stock holding above its key moving averages. BEL is trading above the key EMAs, while the 200 EMA continues to trend higher, confirming long-term trend strength. The recent breakout from a short-term falling channel suggests a pause in momentum rather than a trend reversal. The 20 and 50 EMAs are acting as immediate support, indicating that dips are being bought into. Volume has picked up modestly on the breakout attempt, while selling pressure during consolidation remained muted—a positive sign of accumulation. Structurally, the Rs 405 zone now acts as a strong support base. Sustained trade above this zone keeps the bullish structure intact and opens the path toward the Rs 440 level in the coming sessions. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 440 Stop-Loss: Rs 405 Godrej Consumer Products | CMP: Rs 1,246 Godrej Consumer Products is displaying a clear trend reversal and breakout structure after a prolonged consolidation and base formation. The stock has transitioned from a sideways-to-bearish phase into a fresh bullish leg. Price action on the daily chart shows a strong breakout from a multi-week base near the Rs 1,100–1,120 zone, followed by a series of higher highs and higher lows. The stock has decisively reclaimed the 20, 50, and 100 EMAs, with short-term averages turning upward, signalling renewed bullish momentum. Acceptance above the 100 EMA further strengthens the reversal thesis. Volume expansion during the breakout move, combined with relatively lighter volume during the prior consolidation, highlights accumulation behaviour rather than distribution. The sharp bullish impulse leg suggests strong institutional participation.

Click to View More Outlook for January 23 Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities After showing a high volatility at the lows of around 25000 recently, Nifty bounced back decently on Thursday amidst volatility and closed the day higher by 132 points. After opening with an upside gap of 187 points, the market moved up further in the early part of the session. Profit booking has occurred from near the highs of 25400 in the mid part, but the market recovered towards the end. A small red candle was formed on the daily chart with upper and lower shadow. Technically, this market action indicates a formation of high wave type candle pattern. The formation of high wave type candles in the last two sessions signals heightened volatility in the market. The crucial 200day EMA support has been regained on Thursday and Nifty closed above it. The overall near-term trend of the market remains weak, but the short-term bounce is unfolding. A sustainable up move above 25500 could confirm near term bottom reversal pattern for the Nifty. On the other side, any weakness from here could drag Nifty down to the recent swing lows of around 24900-25000 levels in the near term. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The index consolidated after a positive start, supported by strong global cues. However, it faced resistance near the 38.20% Fibonacci retracement level, resulting in a decline from the day’s high of 25,435 to 25,168 before closing near the midpoint of the session’s range. Although the index managed to close above the 200DMA for the second consecutive day, the overall sentiment remains weak, as reflected by the elevated India VIX, which stood at 13.35. In the short term, the index is likely to remain volatile on Friday. Resistance is placed in the 25,480–25,500 zone, while support is seen around 25,125.

Bajaj Consumer Care is part of the Bajaj Group. Revenue from operations rose 30.57 percent year-on-year to Rs 306.09 crore during the quarter, while total expenses increased 20.9 percent to Rs 254.95 crore. Following the results, brokerage firm Centrum raised its price target on the stock to Rs 340 from Rs 310, stating that the company’s third-quarter performance was a strong beat across parameters.

"Zydus launches Opdivo biosimilar in India, will help cut cancer treatment cost",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/zydus-launches-opdivo-biosimilar-in-india-will-help-cut-cancer-treatment-cost-13785452.html,"Zydus Lifesciences has launched the world’s first biosimilar of nivolumab in India, the pharma company said on January 22, a move that will significantly widen access to one of the most important immunotherapies used in cancer treatment. The product, branded Tishtha, is being introduced at nearly a ‑fourth the price of Amercian drug maker Bristol Myers Squibb’s (BMS) original Opdivo. Tishtha will be available in 100 mg (Rs 28,950) and 40 mg (Rs 13,950) strengths. According to the company, this will help reduce treatment burden for patients who require long, multi‑cycle therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors, a category known to be among the costliest in oncology. “With the launch of Tishtha, we are expanding access to Immuno‑Oncology through a patient‑centric therapy,” Zydus Lifesciences managing director Sharvil P Patel. “Every patient deserves timely access to affordable, advanced cancer care… we remain committed to improving patient access to high‑quality biosimilar immunotherapies.” Why Nivolumab biosimilar matters Nivolumab is one of the most widely prescribed PD‑1 immune checkpoint inhibitors, used across cancer types including lung, melanoma, kidney and Hodgkin lymphoma. These drugs activate the immune system to attack tumors, often extending survival in difficult‑to‑treat cancers. High costs have limited access in lower‑income markets. In India, patients often struggle to maintain continuity of treatment, which can run for several months and require strict dosing schedules. Zydus said its biosimilar aims to address challenges of affordability, consistency and long‑term availability, all of which are critical to patient outcomes. Zydus said Tishtha is developed and manufactured in India, ensuring what Zydus says will be supply continuity for patients who often face interruptions when relying on imported immunotherapies. The availability of two vial strengths is intended to help oncologists optimise dosing and reduce wastage — an important cost consideration in immunotherapy regimens. The company expects the therapy could benefit more than five lakh cancer patients, expanding accessibility to treatments typically restricted to higher‑income cohorts. BMS spokesperson told Moneycontrol that Opdivo’s patent in India remains valid until May 2026.","According to the company, this will help reduce treatment burden for patients who require long, multi‑cycle therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors, a category known to be among the costliest in oncology.","Zydus Lifesciences has launched the world’s first biosimilar of nivolumab in India, the pharma company said on January 22, a move that will significantly widen access to one of the most important immunotherapies used in cancer treatment.",The availability of two vial strengths is intended to help oncologists optimise dosing and reduce wastage — an important cost consideration in immunotherapy regimens.,"Zydus Lifesciences has launched the world’s first biosimilar of nivolumab in India, the pharma company said on January 22, a move that will significantly widen access to one of the most important immunotherapies used in cancer treatment."

"Eternal shares tumble 9% from day's high with management transition in focus, brokerages' concerns over competition",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/eternal-shares-tumble-9-from-day-s-high-with-management-transition-in-focus-brokerages-concerns-over-competition-13785503.html,"The shares of Eternal erased all morning gains and sharply fell more than 9 percent from its day’s high on January 22. This came as brokerages analysed the Zomato and Blinkit-parent’s Q3 results, and what lies ahead. The shares of the company dropped to Rs 276.05 apiece in the afternoon. Earlier during the day, the stock had jumped around 8 percent to hit an intraday high of Rs 305 apiece. This was the highest level seen by the stock since December 1 last year. Eternal Q3 Results: Food delivery and quick commerce firm Eternal, which owns the Zomato and Blinkit, on January 22 reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 102 crore for the October-December quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026. This marked a 73 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise from Rs 59 crore net profit reported in the same quarter of the previous financial year. The firm's revenue from operations meanwhile jumped 202 percent to Rs 16,315 crore in Q3 FY26, from Rs 5,405 crore in Q3 FY25. Total expenses for the Gurugram-based firm increased 198 percent to Rs 16,493 crore in the quarter ended December. Along with the Q3 results, the company announced that founder and Group CEO Deepinder Goyal has resigned from his role, and Blinkit’s CEO Albinder Dhindsa will take over. Motilal Oswal sees Eternal in a 'Dogfight': Motilal Oswal noted that Eternal's revenue growth beat its estimate. Zomato’s NOV of Rs 9,840 crore and Blinkit’s adjusted EBITDA margin at breakeven was also above its estimates. However, the brokerage said that the EBITDA respite in Blinkit will likely be short-lived as competitive intensity in quick commerce (QC) re-accelerates. “Potential elevated discounting/investments in both QC and the going-out business are anticipated to constrain profitability in the short term,” it said. Contrary to its earlier expectations, Motilal sees the risk of Eternal being drawn into a “dogfight”, with lower minimum order values and higher discounts. As a result, it reduced its adjusted EBITDA assumptions by around 15 percent for FY27/28E, and accordingly lowered its target price for the stock to Rs 360 (from Rs 420 earlier), while maintaining its ‘Buy’ call. The latest target price implies an upside potential of nearly 27 percent from the stock’s previous closing price of Rs 283.50 apiece. Emkay Global sees more competition ahead: Emkay Global said that Eternal’s Q3 FY25 surprised positively on the profitability front. “The management said that it will respond to competition and is willing to sacrifice margins. We believe that during a land-grab phase, companies should prioritize market share over margins to build scale that can be monetized over time. Eternal’s results underscore that QCom can be highly profitable at scale and Blinkit’s execution remains strong. We expect competitive intensity to increase in the QCom business and Eternal to focus more on market share, which will lead to slower margin expansion in FY27 and FY28,” it said. The domestic brokerage cut its target price for the stock to Rs 370 per share, implying an upside potential of more than 30.5 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. The firm has a ‘Buy’ rating on the call. Elara Capital says Deepinder Goyal's move augurs well: Elara Capital said that the firm’s Q3 headline growth was a tad ahead of estimates on better growth in food delivery and quick commerce. “Deepinder Goyal’s move to the role of Vice Chairman augurs well. He retains strategic oversight and execution is uninterrupted,” the domestic brokerage noted. It retained its ‘Buy’ call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 415 apiece, implying an upside potential of more than 46 percent. JM Financial on Eternal: JM Financial said that the management transition from Goyal to Dhindsa is expected to be smooth, as it elevates a leader with a demonstrated history of scaling a business that now represents the cornerstone of Eternal’s future growth. “Eternal’s primary growth engine, Blinkit, achieved a significant financial milestone in 3QFY26 as it turned Adj. EBITDA breakeven - surpassing our expectations by at least two quarters. This achievement coincided with a pivotal top-leadership restructuring, effective 1st Feb’26,” the domestic brokerage said. It maintains its conviction that margin expansion will continue, notwithstanding aggressive store expansion plans and ongoing competitive intensity. “We reiterate Eternal as our preferred pick with an unchanged Dec’26 TP of INR 400,” it added.

"Gold, silver ETFs crash after record rally: Should you buy the dip? Here's what experts say",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/gold-silver-etfs-crash-after-record-rally-should-you-buy-the-dip-here-s-what-experts-say-13785382.html,"Gold and silver exchange traded funds (ETFs) crashed on January 22 amid easing tariff concerns. Analysts have advised what investors should do – buy the dip or wait for more consolidation in the precious metals. The ETFs are mirroring the fall in the gold and silver prices which saw a record rally earlier. Tata Silver ETF dropped as much as 21 percent to its day’s low, while Birla Sun Life Gold ETF fell 12 percent before seeing some partial recovery. Why are ETFs falling today? Trump said that he had reached the outlines of a deal with NATO on the island's future. ""Based upon this understanding, I will not be imposing the tariffs that were scheduled to go into effect on February 1st,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social after a meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte in Davos. He did not give details of the deal. Additionally, he also said that US will not use military force to seize Greenland. ""I won't do that,"" Trump said. ""Okay? Now everyone's saying 'oh, good' that's probably the biggest statement I made because people thought I would use force. I don't have to use force, I don't want to use force, I won't use force,” he added. ""Today’s sharp slump in silver and gold ETFs, with some dropping as much as ~21%, reflects an abrupt shift in macro sentiment rather than a fundamental breakdown in precious metals,"" said Justin Khoo, Senior Market Analyst - APAC, VT Market. Earlier, gold and silver prices had sharply shot up after Trump threatened to use military force to acquire Greenland, triggering tensions between US and EU nations. The tariff threats further fuelled the geopolitical tensions and subsequently safe-haven assets like gold and silver due to a rise in risk-off sentiment. Khoo added that while spot gold and silver still reflect historically elevated levels, the ETF correction looks like profit-taking and risk-rebalancing as equity markets rally. What should you do now? The market is divided between those viewing corrections as buying opportunities and those warning of overheated conditions, said Tanvi Kanchan, Associate Director at Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers. She however added that despite price swings, fundamentals are compelling, driven by near-record industrial demand from solar panels, electric vehicles, and AI infrastructure. “Given the current geopolitical landscape—from ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine to U.S.-China tensions and uncertainty around trade policies under the new Trump administration—precious metals maintain their relevance as portfolio hedges,” the analyst said. Kanchan however cautioned that after such explosive gains in 2025, timing a single entry point is “treacherous”. “Rather than deploying capital all at once, investors should consider spreading purchases over the coming weeks or months. This approach captures the dip while protecting against further corrections that could see silver test,” she said. For conservative investors, allocating 5-10 percent of portfolios to precious metals ETFs through systematic purchases reduces timing risk while maintaining exposure to an asset class that benefits from geopolitical instability and monetary policy uncertainty, according to the expert. With structural drivers such as central-bank accumulation, long-term demand and inflation hedging undiminished, disciplined investors may see this correction as a strategic accumulation zone, but should avoid aggressive short-term speculation given ongoing volatility, Khoo from VT Market said. Is there more volatility ahead? Siddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director at Vibhavangal Anukulakara, said that the drastic correction in gold & silver ETFs is a result of profit-booking as well as unwinding of initial risk-off strategies when metal prices reached record highs. “Although precious metals are supported by demand trends as well as supply gaps in the global market, the current scenario of correction in metal prices indicates volatility in the short term,” he added. Nirpendra Yadav, Senior Commodity Research Analyst at Bonanza, said that with global uncertainties, central bank gold accumulation, and expectations of softer real interest rates over the medium term, gold continues to play an important portfolio-hedging and diversification role. Harshal Dasani, Business Head at INVasset PMS, highlighted the sharper fall in silver ETFs compared to MCX silver, and attributed it to how Indian silver had moved into a speculative premium ahead of the Budget, rather than a sudden collapse in underlying global fundamentals. “Over the last two sessions, silver on MCX had significantly outperformed COMEX because of expectations around an import duty tweak or a policy signal in the Budget,” he said. “That premium was not driven by physical tightness alone; it was largely sentiment-led and expectation-driven. Once it became clear that no immediate duty relief was forthcoming, that excess premium started unwinding. Silver ETFs, which are priced off domestic spot benchmarks but also reflect investor flows and arbitrage pressures, tend to react faster in such “premium collapse” phases. When retail investors rush to book profits, ETF units face additional selling pressure even if MCX futures are still stabilizing,” he added.

Revenue too however declined around 3 percent sequentially from Rs 2,167.91 crore in Q2 FY26. JM Financial said that PNB Housing Finance reported an overall mixed quarter with PAT missing its estimate. This was primarily driven by weak disbursment/AUM growth and elevated opex levels, the domestic brokerage said. “On an overall level however asset quality trends were positive, with stable GS3/NS3 at 1.04%/0.68% respectively. Credit costs continued to be negative and stood at -0.19% (vs. -0.55% in 2Q), in-line with management guidance,” JM Financial added, while holding its ‘Buy’ call on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,180 apiece, implying an upside potential of nearly 27 percent from the stock’s previous closing price.

The Revlimid cliff The company’s US sales are facing a significant reset. In an interview to Moneycontrol, chief financial officer MV Narasimham, characterised the upcoming period as a temporary disruption. “This anomaly is going to be within the next four quarters... till December 2026,” Narasimham said in a post-earnings interview on January 21. From January 1, investors should expect negligible sales from Lenalidomide (generic cancer drug Revlimid), he added. The impact is already visible. In the December quarter, US revenues slipped by $35 million sequentially to $338 million, primarily due to lower Revlimid contributions and price erosion. Analysts at Equirus Securities remain cautious, noting that while Q3 Revlimid revenues of over $80 million exceeded expectations, the company’s dependence on the product remains a point of concern. ""DRRD's earnings dependence on Revlimid remains high, but its ability to offset the decline through cost controls and scale-up of semaglutide is debatable,"" the Equirus report said. All depends on execution of semaglutide and biosimilar launches Dr Reddy's is pinning hopes on high-value launches, most notably the GLP-1 drug semaglutide. Narasimham confirmed that the company is ""gearing up for the launch"" in Canada, which is managed as part of its US generics business. The Canada launch is anticipated between late February and May. There is no plant inspection required, and the product is expected to be substitutable, the management said during the earnings call. Beyond weight-loss drugs, the company is advancing a robust biosimilar portfolio. The company has filed a Biologics License Application (BLA) for the intravenous formulation with US approval expected by late calendar 2026. Denosumab, another biosimilar, was launched in the EU, with a US launch likely in the second quarter of FY27 or later due to a CRL, while Rituximab US approval is delayed due to inspection needs, the product has already been launched in the EU. Dr Reddy's is getting ready launch Ozempic (semaglutide) generic in India in March. Narasimham said that the company is ""ramping up the teams"" to support these innovations, particularly in the domestic market. Despite the headwinds in the US, the company delivered what Narasimham called a ""resilient"" performance in Q3. Its net sales stood at Rs.8,727 crores ($971 million), a 4.4 percent year-over-year growth. It EBITDA margin at 23.5 percent, but adjusted to 24.8 percent after excluding a one-time labour code provision of Rs120 crore. The management expects underlying EBITDA margin to be around 24.8 percent to 25 percent after adjusting for one-time provisions. As of December 31, 2025, the company had a net cash surplus at Rs. 3,069 crore.

Why are shrimp and textile stocks rallying? The shares of these export-oriented companies had significantly declined earlier after the Trump administration increased tariffs on Indian imports to a whopping 50 percent, citing New Delhi's continued purchase of Russian oil. However, the rising expectations of India-US finalizing on the trade deal boosted the export-oriented shrimp and textile stocks, which derive a significant portion of their revenue from the American market.

Dalmia Bharat: Volume outperformance powers Q3 earnings,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/moneycontrol-research/dalmia-bharat-volume-outperformance-powers-q3-earnings-13784983.html,"Highlights India's fourth-largest cement manufacturer, Dalmia Bharat, posted strong Q3 FY26 results, overcoming GST-linked demand disruptions in the previous quarter. Going forward, the management intends to scale the business through capacity additions, geographic diversification, cost optimisation and potential inorganic growth opportunities. Quarterly result highlights Dalmia Bharat outperformed the broader cement market in Q3FY26 with volumes growing 10 percent year on year (YoY) to reach 7.3 million tonnes (MT), comfortably surpassing the industry’s growth rate of 6-7 percent. The Q3 volume figures highlight that Dalmia Bharat has regained the market share it had lost in earlier quarters. The share of sales through trade channels came in at 62 percent (vs 66 percent in Q3 FY25), whereas the premium products mix stood steady around 23 percent. Blended realisations contracted 4 percent quarter on quarter (QoQ), owing to the decline in cement prices after GST revisions. During the last quarter, the southern market witnessed a steep fall in prices due to labour shortages and a slowdown in construction activity. Meanwhile, the eastern markets also witnessed weak price trends on account of Bihar elections. Raw material costs grew just 2 percent YoY despite the additional levy of mineral tax in Tamil Nadu (Rs 160 per tonne). Operating margins expanded by 110 basis points to 17.2 percent, primarily driven by the reduction in freight expenses (down 6 percent YoY), while power and fuel costs were stable YoY. As a result, EBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) per tonne came in at Rs 824, up 8 percent YoY. Diversifying manufacturing footprint Dalmia Bharat is targeting a pan-India market presence and intends to reach 75 MT capacity by FY28. The key projects include a 3.6 MT clinker and 3 MT grinding unit at the existing Belgaum plant, and a new 3 MT grinding unit in Pune to strengthen its western Maharashtra presence. Dalmia has commenced commercial production from the Umrangso Clinker line (3.6MT) in Jan-26. The management is also evaluating a 6 MT greenfield expansion in Jaisalmer (Rajasthan), for which land acquisition and mining lease formalities have been completed. Environmental clearance is still pending. The management has given a capex guidance of Rs 4,000 crore for FY26. The company added 143 MW of renewable energy (RE) capacity in 9M FY26, taking its total operational RE capacity to 410 MW. The company is targeting 576 MW of RE capacity by mid-2026. Price trend improving Despite regional pricing headwinds throughout the last quarter, 2026 has started on a strong note with prices firming up by 2–3 percent month-on-month in January across all major territories. However, the key challenges for the sector remain elevated competitive intensity and rising fuel costs. Pet coke prices have increased 15-20 percent YoY, which can constrain margins in coming quarters. Outlook and recommendation The domestic cement sector continues to maintain a positive trajectory, with industry expecting a steady 6-8 percent growth rate due to robust government infrastructure spending, ongoing urban development, and anticipated uptick in private sector demand. Dalmia Bharat’s operational excellence makes it a solid contender in the infrastructure space, though its premium valuation (17.5x FY26 EV/EBITDA) partly reflects the business positives. Therefore, any correction in share price should be viewed as an opportunity to accumulate shares in a healthy company at a reasonable valuation.

Dr Reddy’s stock jumps over 4% today as brokerages turn bullish after Q3 results beat estimates,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/dr-reddy-s-stock-jumps-over-4-today-as-brokerages-turn-bullish-after-q3-results-beat-estimates-13784836.html,"Shares of Dr Reddy’s Laboratories surged over 4 percent in early trade on Thursday after the pharmaceutical company delivered a better-than-expected set of Q3 FY26 results, prompting brokerages to turn more constructive on the stock. The stock outlook turned positive despite a year-on-year decline in profit and continued pressure in the US business. At about 9:20 am, Dr Reddy's shares were trading at Rs 1,208 on NSE, up 4.4 percent from the previous close. Yesterday, ahead of the results, the stock had lost just under 1 percent. Dr Reddy’s reported a 14.4 percent year-on-year fall in consolidated net profit to Rs 1,209.8 crore for the December quarter, smaller than Street expectations of about Rs 1,070 crore. Revenue from operations rose 4.4 percent YoY to Rs 8,726.8 crore, aided by strong growth in India and emerging markets, even as the North America business weighed on overall performance. EBITDA declined 10.8 percent YoY to Rs 2,049.3 crore, while gross margins moderated to 53.6 percent from 58.7 percent a year ago. Dr Reddy's Laboratories stock call: Brokerages upbeat Brokerages said the earnings beat was driven largely by the domestic and emerging markets portfolio, which helped offset weakness in the US. India revenues climbed 19 percent YoY, supported by price increases and the contribution from the Stugeron brand acquired from Johnson & Johnson, while North America revenues declined 12 percent amid a sharp slowdown in Lenalidomide sales. HSBC maintained a buy call on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,435, citing stronger-than-expected sales growth in India and Russia, along with favourable foreign exchange benefits. The brokerage said investor focus now hinges on regulatory approvals for generic semaglutide in Canada and the abatacept biosimilar (IV formulation) in the US, flagging timely approvals as key catalysts for the stock. CLSA upgraded Dr Reddy’s to hold from sell and raised its target price to Rs 1,210, saying the company delivered an earnings beat in Q3. The brokerage highlighted strong growth across India and emerging markets, partly offset by the decline in the US due to lower Revlimid sales. CLSA expects single-digit growth in the US excluding Revlimid and double-digit growth across other geographies, adding that semaglutide has received India approval and is targeted for launch in March, which could support domestic growth momentum. Near-term concerns around Lenalidomide persist, but brokerages broadly believe that sustained growth in India and emerging markets could help stabilise earnings and support the stock over the medium term.

The move lifted the company’s market capitalisation to about Rs 2.74 lakh crore. Eternal stock is building on Wednesday’s nearly 5 percent gain, with buying momentum driven by upbeat brokerage commentary following the Q3 FY26 earnings announcement. Why Eternal (Zomato) stock is rising Eternal, which owns Zomato and Blinkit, reported a 73 percent year-on-year rise in consolidated net profit to Rs 102 crore for the December quarter, in line with estimates. Revenue jumped to Rs 16,315 crore, ahead of expectations, led by the quick commerce business. EBITDA rose to Rs 368 crore, with margins expanding to 2.3 percent, while Blinkit and Hyperpure turned adjusted EBITDA-profitable during the quarter. The inflection at Blinkit -- which posted an adjusted EBITDA profit of Rs 4 crore after losses in recent quarters -- has emerged as the key catalyst for the stock. Brokerages upbeat; leadership transition seen as manageable Brokerages struck a largely bullish tone on the results, pointing to Blinkit’s profitability milestone and improving unit economics. CLSA reiterated its 'high-conviction outperform call' with a target price of Rs 503, citing stronger-than-expected contribution per order and a 121 percent year-on-year jump in Blinkit’s net order value. Jefferies and HSBC also maintained buy ratings, highlighting quick commerce EBITDA break-even and food delivery growth acceleration, while Nomura flagged execution consistency as a key monitor despite reiterating a buy call. Alongside the earnings, Eternal announced a leadership transition, with founder Deepinder Goyal stepping down as MD & CEO and Blinkit CEO Albinder Dhindsa set to take over, subject to shareholder approval. Brokerages said the change does not materially alter the near-term investment case, noting that operational control had already been centred around Blinkit under Dhindsa’s leadership.

Eternal stock outlook: Brokerages bullish on Zomato after strong Q3 results as Blinkit turns EBITDA-positive,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/eternal-stock-outlook-brokerages-bullish-on-zomato-after-strong-q3-results-as-blinkit-turns-ebitda-positive-13784798.html,"Shares of Eternal Ltd (Zomato) are in focus with the brokerages sharing bullish views on Q3 FY26 results, on the back of a strong quick commerce showing and improving profitability metrics. Ahead of the quarterly results, Eternal stock jumped nearly 5 percent to end at Rs 282.8 on Wednesday. The optimistic brokerage commentary on Eternal's fiscal third quarter results reflects growing confidence in execution, particularly at Blinkit. However, analysts flagged the leadership transition at the top involving founder Deepinder Goyal as a point to monitor. What drove Eternal (Zomato) strong Q3 earnings Eternal, which houses Zomato and Blinkit, reported a 73 percent rise in consolidated net profit to Rs 102 crore for Q3 FY26, in line with estimates, while a tripling in revenue to Rs 16,315 crore. The expansion was led by quick commerce. EBITDA came in at Rs 368 crore, with margins expanding to 2.3 percent. Importantly, Blinkit and Hyperpure turned adjusted EBITDA-profitable during the quarter, marking a key milestone. Zomato stock call: Brokerages see Blinkit inflection as the key trigger CLSA reiterated its 'high-conviction outperform' call on Eternal stock with a target price of Rs 503 per share, implying an upside of nearly 78 percent. CLSA cited Blinkit’s contribution per order beating estimates alongside a 121 percent year-on-year jump in net order value (NOV). The brokerage also highlighted higher-than-expected monthly transacting users, attributing this to consistent pricing and better customer quality; it raised its FY26-28 estimates by 5-15 percent. Jefferies maintained a 'buy' rating with a target of Rs 480, noting that Blinkit delivered positive EBITDA at a time when competitive intensity appears near its peak. On management changes, Jefferies said the transition from founder Deepinder Goyal to Blinkit CEO Albinder Dhindsa as MD & CEO does not alter the near-term outlook, with both leaders continuing their existing responsibilities. HSBC kept its 'buy' call with a target of Rs 350, flagging “multiple positive surprises” in the quarter, including food delivery growth acceleration and quick commerce EBITDA break-even. HSBC also argued that the Q2 slowdown in quick commerce growth was driven by GST changes and seasonality, leaving room for upside to FY27 NOV estimates. Nomura reiterated a 'buy' rating and set a target price of Rs 380. While it said food delivery performance was broadly in line and growth is picking up, Nomura cautioned that quick commerce growth was marginally below expectations despite the surprise break-even, and that the organisational transition warrants close monitoring. It also flagged the risk of prolonged pressure on quick commerce profitability. Management transition in focus Alongside earnings, Eternal announced that founder Deepinder Goyal will step down as MD & CEO and be proposed as Vice Chairman and Director, subject to shareholder approval, with Albinder Dhindsa taking over as MD & CEO. Goyal said he will remain involved at the board level, while day-to-day execution shifts to Dhindsa, who led Blinkit from acquisition to breakeven. Eternal stock performance Eternal shares ended Wednesday nearly 5 percent higher at Rs 282.8, taking the stock’s one-year gains to about 31 percent, well ahead of the benchmark Nifty 50. Even so, the stock remains well below its 52-week high of Rs 368.45. Brokerages believe this gap could narrow if Blinkit sustains profitability and food delivery growth continues to improve.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Tech Mahindra, JK Tyre, Paytm, Hindustan Zinc, Havells India, and others on January 22?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-tech-mahindra-jk-tyre-paytm-hindustan-zinc-havells-india-and-others-on-january-22-13784502.html,"Equity benchmarks closed a volatile session with a one-third percent loss on January 21, with market breadth consistently favouring bears. A total of 2,067 shares saw correction compared to 882 advancing shares on the NSE. A doji-like pattern formation and oversold RSI signal the possibility of a bounce-back, but the sustainability of the same remains key to watch. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Arun Kumar Mantri, Founder of Mantri FinMart Tech Mahindra | CMP: Rs 1,686.7 Tech Mahindra is showing inherent strength, with short-term signs of base formation after a corrective move from recent highs. The stock is trading around its short-term moving averages (20-DMA and 50-DMA), indicating bullish sentiment, while the RSI is hovering near the lower band (around 35–40), suggesting the stock is close to oversold territory and may see a technical pullback. Momentum indicators remain muted, but selling pressure is gradually reducing near support zones, and some upside momentum may resume in the near-term period. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,744 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,652 UltraTech Cement | CMP: Rs 12,231 UltraTech Cement is showing initial signs of short-term base formation, coupled with healthy trading volumes. On technical indicators, the stock is trading around its key moving averages of 20-, 50-, and 200-day, which are providing support and indicating broader bullish sentiment. Further, oscillators such as the RSI are in neutral territory, suggesting neither strong overbought nor oversold conditions, while MACD readings and some short-term averages indicate cautious momentum. Overall, this suggests price consolidation with a bullish bias. If key support levels hold, the price may move towards the Rs 12,500-plus zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 12,594 Stop-Loss: Rs 12,010 TVS Motor Company | CMP: Rs 3,602 TVS Motor is currently hovering around strong support zones of Rs 3,550–3,600 on the daily charts. Technical indicators are showing mixed signals, with short-term base formation coupled with oversold conditions that may attract some counter-trend buying at the current juncture. On the daily chart, key momentum tools like the RSI are deeply oversold, while oscillators such as MACD and Stochastic suggest oversold zones on short-term momentum indicators. On the other hand, any price break below the Rs 3,500 zone, which is a key support, may suggest a continuation of the ongoing correction, while any sustained move above it may resume short covering in the counter. Resistance for the price is around Rs 3,770–3,790 on the short-term timeframe. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,753 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,512 Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical and Derivatives Research at SBI Securities JK Tyre and Industries | CMP: Rs 510.95 JK Tyre has been consolidating in the Rs 525–483 range since December 23, indicating a healthy pause after the prior move. Despite the sideways action, the stock continues to hold above its 20-day EMA, which is acting as a dynamic support. The RSI has reclaimed the 60 level, while the MACD remains above both the signal and zero lines. Holding above the Bollinger Band midline, momentum indicators suggest the stock is well positioned for an upside breakout. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 510–505. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 545 Stop-Loss: Rs 490 One 97 Communications Paytm | CMP: Rs 1,235.9 Paytm had been consolidating in the Rs 1,248–1,357 range since early December, but repeated failures near the Rs 1,355–1,360 resistance zone signalled exhaustion. The stock has now broken below the lower end of this range, closing lower on January 21, confirming a bearish breakdown. Momentum indicators have deteriorated sharply, with the RSI slipping below 40 and DI– crossing above DI+, indicating growing bearish control. The MACD remains below both the signal and zero lines, suggesting further downside risk in the near term. Hence, we recommend selling the stock in the zone of Rs 1,235–1,230 with a stop-loss of Rs 1,265. On the downside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 1,130 in the short term. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 1,130 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,265 Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities Hindustan Zinc | CMP: Rs 697.55 Hindustan Zinc has been on a dream run, with the ascending chart pattern remaining intact across multiple timeframes. Dips are being bought, and rallies remain strong. The RSI has recently re-entered a bullish crossover, and the price continues to trade comfortably above the 20 EMA. In the short term, the trend is likely to remain strong, with the potential to rally towards Rs 730. Support is placed at Rs 685; a break below this level could lead to a decline.

"Torrent Pharma takes control of JB Pharma, overhauls board & senior leadership",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/torrent-pharma-takes-control-of-jb-pharma-overhauls-board-senior-leadership-13783837.html,"Torrent Pharmaceuticals Ltd., on Wednesday told stock exchanges that it has completed its acquisition of JB Chemicals & Pharmaceuticals Ltd., triggering an overhaul of the company’s board and senior leadership. The transaction, which closed on January 21, 2026, involved Torrent purchasing 7,44,81,519 shares, or 46.39% of JB Pharma’s fully diluted equity, from Tau Investment Holdings Pte. Ltd., an entity of US Private Equity firm KKR, under a share purchase agreement signed on June 29, 2025, and amended on July 3, 2025. With the acquisition now consummated—and an additional 1,317 shares picked up through the open offer—Torrent has formally assumed controlling promoter status at JB Pharma. JB Pharma’s board met the same day to record the change in control, acknowledge Torrent as the incoming promoter, and formally reclassify Tau as a public shareholder under SEBI rules. The transition has prompted significant churn in JB Pharma’s governance structure. Three non‑executive, non‑independent directors—Gaurav Trehan, Akshay Tanna, and Prashant Kumar—resigned from the board, citing the change in control and the need to facilitate reconstitution. Each resignation took effect immediately at the conclusion of the board meeting. The shake‑up extended to senior management: Nikhil Chopra, JB Pharma’s Whole‑time Director and Chief Executive Officer, tendered his resignation. He stepped down as Whole‑time Director effective immediately and will continue as CEO only until March 31, 2026, after which he will exit the company entirely to pursue other professional opportunities. In parallel, the company announced a slate of new board appointments backed by Torrent Pharma’s nominations. Aman Mehta, Managing Director of Torrent Pharma, has been appointed Managing Director of JB Pharma for a three‑year term. Mehta, who has played a key role in Torrent’s acquisitions—including Unichem and Curatio—brings deep operational experience and strategic oversight from his decade‑long tenure within the Torrent Group. Three additional directors were also inducted are Amal Kelshikar, a pharma veteran with 32 years of experience across Abbott, Novartis, AstraZeneca, and Baxter, Hasmukh Patel, Torrent Pharma’s Chief Operating Officer and Sudhir Menon, Executive Director (Finance) & CFO of Torrent Pharma. With Torrent now in operational control, JB Pharma's board committees have also been reconstituted effective January 21, 2026, and the company will seek shareholder approval for the new appointments through a postal ballot. Torrent Pharmaceuticals agreed to acquire JB Chemicals & Pharmaceuticals in a landmark transaction valuing JB Pharma at Rs 25,689 crore on a fully diluted basis. As part of this, Torrent purchased the 46.39 percent stake from Tau Investment Holdings (a KKR entity) for Rs 11,917 crore, paying Rs 1,600 per share. Additional components of the transaction include open offer for 26 percent of public shareholding at Rs 1,639.18 per share, totaling Rs 6,842.8 crore, and also acquisition of up to 2.8 percent from employees at the same Rs.1,600 price, costing Rs 719 crore. The transaction strengthens Torrent’s footprint in branded generics and chronic therapies—segments where JB Pharma has long maintained strong franchises in gastrointestinal, hypertension, and pediatric categories. With control secured and management realigned, the acquisition positions Torrent to accelerate portfolio expansion, supply‑chain integration, and margin improvements within its India‑focused growth strategy.","JB Pharma’s board met the same day to record the change in control, acknowledge Torrent as the incoming promoter, and formally reclassify Tau as a public shareholder under SEBI rules.","Additional components of the transaction include open offer for 26 percent of public shareholding at Rs 1,639.18 per share, totaling Rs 6,842.8 crore, and also acquisition of up to 2.8 percent from employees at the same Rs.1,600 price, costing Rs 719 crore.","The transaction, which closed on January 21, 2026, involved Torrent purchasing 7,44,81,519 shares, or 46.39% of JB Pharma’s fully diluted equity, from Tau Investment Holdings Pte.","JB Pharma’s board met the same day to record the change in control, acknowledge Torrent as the incoming promoter, and formally reclassify Tau as a public shareholder under SEBI rules."
Dr. Reddy’s set for March launch of affordable Ozempic generic in India; ramps up market‑priming efforts,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/dr-reddy-s-set-for-march-launch-of-affordable-ozempic-generic-in-india-ramps-up-market-priming-efforts-13784215.html,"Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories is gearing up to launch its generic version of semaglutide in India on March 21, positioning itself for an early mover advantage in one of the country’s largest chronic disease opportunities. The company confirmed that the first wave of approvals covers the injectable formulation of Ozempic, Novo Nordisk’s blockbuster diabetes drug, with oral and weight‑loss versions to follow. The pharmaceutical major said it is preparing for a “competitive” pricing strategy aimed at boosting affordability and expanding access among India’s growing diabetes population. Executives reiterated that affordability remains a core pillar of Dr. Reddy’s India playbook, though they stopped short of disclosing exact price points. Market estimates suggest generic versions of semaglutide could enter at 50–60% below the innovator. “We would ensure that it is a competitive pricing in the market,” said M.V. Ramana, CEO – India & Emerging Markets, when asked about where Dr. Reddy’s plans to position the drug versus Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic, at company's post earnings media call on Wednesday. “Affordability has been something that is core to Dr. Reddy’s, so that’s the plan as we get ready to launch the product.” Dr. Reddy’s said it is fully equipped to handle demand from day one, drawing on both in‑house facilities and contract manufacturing partners. The company is preparing manufacturing capacity for up to 12 million injectable pens annually through partner channels alone. The drug is fully developed in‑house, including the active pharmaceutical ingredient, and will also be supplied to domestic partners who will market it independently. CEO Erez Israeli added, “we are aiming for about 12 million pens that can come from the partner in one year. And we hope that we can sell all of it or most of it.” Executives confirmed that Dr. Reddy’s has already begun priming the market ahead of the launch. This includes deploying dedicated field forces to promote the drug, running large‑scale medical education programmes with Indian and global specialists, and building a patient‑support ecosystem to help with therapy adherence once treatment begins. The company said its promotional efforts will remain focused strictly on healthcare professionals, distancing itself from cosmetic or off‑label weight‑loss use. Alongside the India rollout, the company is preparing for launches across more than 80 markets over the next 12 months. Canada is among the earliest target countries, with Dr. Reddy’s awaiting a decision on its regulatory submission. Approval could arrive any time between now and mid‑May, allowing the company to launch even before May if regulators clear the product early. Additional priority markets include Turkey, Brazil and several emerging markets where Dr. Reddy’s will sell both directly and through business-to-business partners. The current approval in India covers only the injectable version for diabetes treatment. Market authorization for the oral semaglutide tablet and the Wegovy‑equivalent obesity indication will follow separately once regulatory clearances are obtained. The company said it intends to enter both oral and injectable GLP‑1 formats, reflecting global treatment trends that are expanding rapidly into obesity care. Executives described semaglutide as one of the most significant commercial opportunities for India’s pharmaceutical sector, given rising incidence of diabetes and growing awareness around weight management therapies. The company expects the product to become a meaningful growth driver for its India business beginning FY26. Dr. Reddy’s aims to leverage this launch as part of its broader ambition to climb into the top five pharma companies in the Indian market by the end of the decade—a target driven by a mix of innovative therapies, consumer health growth and strategic inorganic opportunities.",And we hope that we can sell all of it or most of it.” Executives confirmed that Dr. Reddy’s has already begun priming the market ahead of the launch.,"“Affordability has been something that is core to Dr. Reddy’s, so that’s the plan as we get ready to launch the product.” Dr. Reddy’s said it is fully equipped to handle demand from day one, drawing on both in‑house facilities and contract manufacturing partners.",The pharmaceutical major said it is preparing for a “competitive” pricing strategy aimed at boosting affordability and expanding access among India’s growing diabetes population.,"Dr. Reddy’s aims to leverage this launch as part of its broader ambition to climb into the top five pharma companies in the Indian market by the end of the decade—a target driven by a mix of innovative therapies, consumer health growth and strategic inorganic opportunities."
"Taking Stock: Market extends losing streak to third session; Sensex down 271 pts, Nifty under 25,200",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/taking-stock-market-extends-losing-streak-to-third-session-sensex-down-271-pts-nifty-under-25-200-13783642.html,"The Indian equity market extended its losing streak for a third consecutive session on January 21 amid weak global cues, including geopolitical tensions over Greenland and a sharp sell-off in Japanese government debt. The sustained selling pressure dragged the benchmark indices below their 200-day moving averages for the first time in eight months. The market opened on a negative note, and continued selling pushed the Nifty index below the 25,000 mark intraday for the first time since October 6, 2025. However, value buying in select stocks helped the index recover from the day’s low, enabling it to close above 25,100. At close, the Sensex was down 270.84 points or 0.33 percent at 81,909.63, and the Nifty was down 75 points or 0.30 percent at 25,157.50. The broader indices once again underperformed the benchmarks, with the BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices declining about 1 percent each.

Except for metal and oil & gas, all other sectoral indices ended in the red, with pharma, IT, private banks, realty and PSU banks declining between 0.5-1 percent. On the Nifty, Trent, Bharat Electronics, ICICI Bank, Tata Consumer and Apollo Hospitals were among the top losers, while Eternal, Max Healthcare, InterGlobe Aviation, Hindalco and JSW Steel featured among the gainers.

Outlook for January 22 Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The Nifty has fallen below the 200DMA on an intraday basis for the first time in many weeks. It usually shakes the market when the 200DMA is challenged, and it is not going to be just black and white. Over the next few days, the index may remain highly volatile. On the lower end, support is placed at 25,125. A decisive fall below 25,125 could trigger further panic in the market. On the higher end, resistance on a closing basis is placed at 25,200. Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities After showing sharp weakness on Tuesday, Nifty shifted into a high volatility with weak bias on Wednesday and closed the day lower by 75 points. Nifty opened on a weak note and continued with negative trend in the early-mid part of the session. Upside recovery has emerged from near 24900 levels in the mid part, but the market was not able to sustain the recovery towards the end and closed lower. A small green candle has been formed on the daily chart with long upper and lower shadow. Technically, this market action indicates a formation of doji type candle pattern (not a classical one), which is reflecting ongoing volatility in the market. Normally a formation of doji after a reasonable decline calls for a reversal post confirmation. The underlying trend of the market continues to be weak. Nifty is finding difficulty in sustaining above the crucial support of 25150 levels (200day EMA). Further weakness below 24900 could possibly drag Nifty down to 24500 in the near term. However, a sustainable upmove above 25200 is likely to open short term bounce back in the market.

"Amid pre-Budget market sell-off, where are the pockets of value for investors? Here's what analysts say",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/amid-pre-budget-market-sell-off-where-are-the-pockets-of-value-for-investors-here-s-what-analysts-say-13783188.html,"Markets have seen significant decline over three consecutive sessions, with Sensex crashing nearly 2,500 points this week so far. Analysts have highlighted which sectors seem attractive at this point of time, ahead of Union Budget on February 1. Sensex plunged more than 1,056 points (nearly 1.3 percent) to hit an intraday low of 81,124.45 on January 21, before seeing a sharp recovery to briefly move into the green and then falling again. Nifty 50 meanwhile fell 313 points (over 1.2 percent) to its day's low of 24,919.8 on Wednesday, which marks a decline of 775 points (more than 3 percent) this week so far. However, after falling below the crucial 25,000-level, the index sharply rebounded before slipping into the deep red again. All the major sectoral indices were in red, with consumer durables, banks and IT leading losses. Broader markets were also in deep red, with smallcap and midcap indices underperforming benchmarks. India's volatility index jumped to 14.43, highest since June, signaling increased market stress. The sharp uptick in volatility highlights elevated intraday swings and fragile sentiment, as reflected in a weak advance-decline ratio, said SAMCO Securities. What to expect from Budget? Citi prefers themes of defence and affordable housing before Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presents Union Budget 2026 on February 1. Citi Research expects Union Budget for fiscal year 2027 to offer limited support for consumption and to stay anchored on targeted priorities such as affordable housing and health insurance It sees the government maintaining a strong tilt toward public capital expenditure, with spending budgeted above nominal GDP growth and led by defence outlays. It added that fiscal consolidation must continue even as options to raise tax revenues narrow after major cuts to corporate tax, personal income tax, and the GST regime. Is pre-Budget market crash reason to worry? Markets are correcting ahead of the Budget largely due to global geopolitical uncertainty and risk-off sentiment, not because Indian businesses are fundamentally weak, said Tushar Badjate, Director of Badjate Stock & Share. He added that corporate balance sheets are stable, earnings are largely intact, and India continues to remain one of the strongest growth stories globally. The start of 2026 has been turbulent following complex interplay between global trade uncertainties, aggressive foreign institutional investor (FII) outflows, and the proximity of the Union Budget, said Balaji Rao Mudili, Research Analyst at Bonanza. He added that the primary catalyst for this divergence is the looming threat of US-led trade tariffs following tensions surrounding the proposed Greenland policy and the subsequent threat of tariffs on multiple European and emerging market counterparts which is testing the traditional ""buy the dip"" mentality. The uncertainty surrounding India-US trade negotiations and depreciating rupee has been other factors adding fuel to the fire. Pre-Budget sell-offs tend to be driven more by uncertainty than by a sudden deterioration in fundamentals, and that often creates selective value opportunities, said Anirudh Garg, Partner and Fund Manager, INVasset PMS. “India’s underlying growth, corporate balance sheets and earnings visibility remain intact. For value investors, this correction is throwing up selective opportunities rather than reasons to panic,” he said. Which sectors looks attractive now? Ahead of the Budget, Citi Research flags defence as a preferred theme. It named Bharat Electronics (BEL) as a top pick. It also favours affordable housing plays such as Aavas Financiers and Aadhar Housing Finance. Citi says domestic manufacturing competitiveness could improve if the government overhauls the customs duty architecture. It added that any tweaks to buyback or dividend taxation, or to the STT and capital gains regime, would directly move capital markets and remain key monitorables. The market volatility preceding the budget has unlocked some pockets of value for a long-term investor, said Pranav Koomar, Founder and CEO of PlusCash. Defensive areas like FMCG, healthcare, quality large-cap financial stocks, and some PSU banks look attractive on valuations, the analyst said. He added that capex-linked spaces like infrastructure, defence, and the railway sector will continue to get government outlays, which could be a trigger. In such phases, value investors are better served looking at businesses where earnings visibility remains intact but valuations have corrected due to broader risk aversion, Garg said. He added that rather than choosing between defensives or cyclicals in a binary manner, the focus should be on balance-sheet strength, pricing power, and cash-flow durability. “Traditionally defensive pockets do provide relative stability during volatility, but several economically sensitive areas are also beginning to look attractive after meaningful price corrections, especially where order visibility or domestic demand drivers remain strong. What the market is penalising most right now are stocks that were priced for perfection. As history shows, pre-Budget corrections often reward investors who accumulate gradually, avoid leverage, and stay aligned to companies with sustainable earnings rather than reacting to short-term sentiment swings,” Garg said. Badjate, meanwhile, said that history suggests that during periods of heightened volatility, metals, mining, oil & gas and select PSU stocks tend to outperform as they offer relative stability and act as a hedge against sharp drawdowns in small and mid-cap segments. While defensives (FMCG, pharma, etc) offer a valuation safety net, the primary engines of India's GDP growth are expected to be banking (BFSI) and manufacturing, said Balaji Rao Mudili, Research Analyst at Bonanza. ""In manufacturing, defence sector can be focused due to higher allocation expectation in the budget following need of increasing security on the borders and a push towards indigenization efforts i.e. creating import substitution and promote Make in India initiatives. Additionally, global headwinds leading to war like situations can benefit defence stocks,"" he added. Currently, ""defensives"" like pharma and healthcare offer a margin of safety, while the IT sector gains traction due to attractive valuations and AI-driven growth, said Sanchita Mukherji, Managing Partner, Talk The Walk LLP. ""Simultaneously, value is emerging in policy-driven sectors like Infrastructure, Railways, and Renewable Energy, where long-term government capex remains a structural tailwind. Rather than chasing momentum, investors may educate themselves on quality large-caps and sectors with high earnings visibility, as these ""pockets of value"" typically lead the recovery once the event risk subsides,"" she added. What should investors do? In such uncertain phases, investors should avoid panic selling, except in illiquid, loss-making or very small microcap stocks, Badjate said. ""Commodities can be added cautiously with a long-term view, avoiding aggressive positioning. For investors unsure about direct stock selection, ETFs provide a sensible way to gain exposure. This is a phase to stay disciplined, not emotional,"" the analyst concluded.

The Technical Textiles business also came under pressure impacted by margin stress in Belting Fabric due to continued influx of cheaper Chinese imports and US tariffs affecting export volumes. Outlook The company is investing Rs15–20bn in Odisha for establishing nextgeneration refrigerant facilities. Additionally, subdued agrochemical demand and persistent oversupply from Chinese producers remain key concerns. We remain cautious on the stock, maintaining a ‘HOLD’ rating with an SOTP-based TP of Rs2,994.

Some brokerages remained optimistic and increased their target prices for the stock, while some cited valuation concerns. SRF shares meanwhile tumbled more than 5 percent to trade at a nine-month low of Rs 2,730.10 apiece. Both these companies had released their results in the post-market hours of January 20. Persistent Systems Q3 Results: Persistent Systems reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 439.45 crore for Q3 FY26. This marks an 18 percent year-on-year (YoY) increase from the Rs 372.99 crore net profit reported in Q3 FY25, but 7 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) decline from Rs 471.47 crore reported in Q2 FY26. The net profit reported in the third quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026 however includes 1.8 percent one-time impact due to the new labour codes. The firm’s revenue from operations rose 23 percent YoY to Rs 3,778.2 crore during the quarter under review. “We are also applying Agentic AI within our own operations, as a ‘customer zero’ to improve productivity and speed adoption at scale, an approach further validated by our recognition as a Microsoft Frontier Firm. As we move ahead, our priority remains sustaining growth through consistent execution as demand continues to shift toward larger, more complex engagements,” said Persistent’s CEO Sandeep Kalra.

This implies an upside potential of nearly 20 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. The domestic brokerage said that the firm reported yet another strong quarter in Q3, with revenue meeting elevated expectations. It added that margins beat expectations materially. “PSYS continues to have a competitive edge and is benefitting from AI-led modernization, adoption and data readiness led demand. Its head start with platforms/tools such as SASVA and iAURA, alongside internal AI-led productivity efforts allows it to present a compelling value proposition on cost and speed of delivery to clients, driving deal momentum in our view,” JM Financial said. Choice Institutional Equities on Persistent Systems: Choice Institutional Equities increased its target price for the stock to Rs 7,000 per share, while maintaining its ‘Add’ rating. This implies an upside potential of more than 10 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. “Despite ongoing macro uncertainty, the company has sustained consistent execution, led by its strengthening product engineering capabilities…enhancing its competitive positioning in enterprise AI,” it said. HSBC on Persistent Systems: HSBC held a ‘Hold’ call for the stock with a target price of Rs 6,560 per share, which implies an upside potential of more than 3 percent from the stock’s previous closing price.

However, it noted that the market expectations seem to be fully priced in the valuation. Nomura on Persistent Systems: Nomura held a ‘Neutral’ call for the stock, with a target price of Rs 6,100 per share. The international brokerage said that the IT company’s growth was in-line with estimates, and margin beat expectations in Q3 FY26. SRF Q3 Results: SRF reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 432.66 crore for Q3 FY26, marking a 60 percent YoY rise from Rs 271.08 crore reported in Q3 FY25. The firm’s revenue from operations meanwhile gained 6 percent YoY to Rs 3,712.53 crore, missing estimates. Brokerage UBS says SRF's medium‑term growth looks constrained due to elevated refrigerant prices, continued Chinese pricing pressure, ongoing weakness in agri‑chem, and management abandoning its 20 percent specialty‑chem growth target.

"Asian shares extend selloff, global bond rout stokes fresh anxiety",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/asian-shares-extend-selloff-global-bond-rout-stokes-fresh-anxiety-13782387.html,"Asian stocks extended their losses for a third session on Wednesday, undone by heightened tensions over U.S. threats to acquire Greenland ahead of President Donald Trump's Davos speech, while a global bond rout appeared to slow for now. Fears of offshore selling of U.S. assets - the so-called ""Sell America"" trade that emerged after last year's ""Liberation Day"" tariff announcements in April - gripped markets as Wall Street tumbled over 2% overnight and the U.S. dollar suffered its biggest fall in over a month. That sent investors fleeing to the safety of gold and silver, which both notched record highs. ""The 'sell America' trade was the driving force behind major market moves overnight, as investors looked to reduce exposure to the U.S., seen by many as an unreliable partner pursuing self-defeating policies,"" said Mantas Vanagas, a senior economist at Westpac. Trump, however, doubled down on his rhetoric over Greenland, saying there was ""no going back"" on his goal to control the island, refusing to rule out taking it by force. His threat of tariffs on Europe has also rekindled fears of a global trade war. The European Union will convene an emergency summit in Brussels on Thursday to discuss the matter, with the long-standing U.S.-EU alliance clearly at risk. All eyes are now on the World Economic Forum in Davos where Trump is due to deliver a speech on Wednesday. In early trade, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.3%. Japan's Nikkei slumped 1.2%, down for the fifth straight day. Nasdaq futures and S&P 500 futures advanced 0.2% after Wall Street suffered the biggest daily drop in three months overnight. The S&P 500 lost 2.06% while the Nasdaq Composite tumbled 2.4%. Both EURO STOXX 50 futures and DAX futures fell 0.4%. JAPAN'S BOND ROUT PAUSES FOR NOW The global bond market was still reeling from a brutal selloff, having been caught up in a perfect storm of worries over exposure to U.S. assets and a surge in Japanese government bond yields. Market worries over increased government spending under Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi sent bond yields there skyrocketing to record highs. Investors were trying to catch their breath in early trading. Providing some relief to frayed debt market nerves, the 40-year Japanese government bond yields retreated 6 basis points on Wednesday to 4.145% after surging 26 bps a day earlier to a record high of 4.215%. Liquidity in other tenors remains thin. U.S. Treasury yields were also steady on Wednesday. The benchmark 10-year yield slipped 1 bp to 4.285%, having jumped 7 bp overnight to a five-month high of 4.313% amid the ""Sell America"" fears. Danish pension fund AkademikerPension said on Tuesday it would sell off its holding of U.S. Treasuries, worth some $100 million, by the end of this month, blaming weak U.S. government finances. In the currency markets, the U.S. dollar held steady at 98.56 against its major peers, having dropped 0.5% overnight - the biggest daily fall since early December. The yen was steady at 158.19 per dollar, but lost out on a number of crosses, with the Swiss franc hitting a record high of 200.19 yen. The Bank of Japan meets on Friday and though no rate hike is expected this time, policymakers could flag a tightening as soon as April. Oil prices fell as pressure from geopolitical tensions and an expected build-up in U.S. crude inventories outweighed a temporary halt in output at two large fields in Kazakhstan. West Texas Intermediate crude oil prices for March fell 1.31% to $59.57 a barrel.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade HDFC Life Insurance, Mastek, Dalmia Bharat, JK Cement, Lodha Developers, and others on January 21?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-hdfc-life-insurance-mastek-dalmia-bharat-jk-cement-lodha-developers-and-others-on-january-21-13782320.html,"The benchmark indices were caught in a bear trap, with the Nifty 50 falling 1.38 percent on January 20. Market breadth was heavily dominated by bears, with about 2,552 shares declining against 388 rising shares on the NSE. The market may consolidate with a negative bias after decisively breaking below the previous week’s low. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Amol Athawale, VP Technical Research at Kotak Securities Britannia Industries | CMP: Rs 5,884 After the short-term correction in Britannia from higher levels, the downward momentum has stalled and the stock has entered a consolidation phase over the last few sessions. Moreover, the stock is trading near its important demand zone. The structure suggests a revival of the uptrend from current levels in the near future. For traders, Rs 5,660 would be the key support level to watch. Above this level, the uptrend structure could continue towards Rs 6,300. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 6,300 Stop-Loss: Rs 5,660 Oil and Natural Gas Corporation | CMP: Rs 240.39 After the sharp up move over the last couple of sessions, ONGC witnessed profit booking from higher levels. However, closing near the important retracement zone and the short-term moving average suggests a bullish continuation chart structure. Therefore, the stock is likely to resume its uptrend in the coming sessions. For the next few trading sessions, Rs 232 could be the trend-decider level for the bulls. If the stock sustains above this level, a further uptrend towards Rs 257 can be expected. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 257 Stop-Loss: Rs 232 HDFC Life Insurance Company | CMP: Rs 732.1 On the daily timeframe, HDFC Life has been in a downtrend. Therefore, it is currently in oversold territory and is trading near its demand area. The texture of the chart formation and the RSI indicate that the stock is likely to rebound for a new leg of the up move from its demand zone. For positional traders, Rs 705 would be the decisive level. Trading above this level, the uptrend formation may continue towards Rs 785. However, if the stock closes below Rs 705, traders may prefer to exit long positions. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 785 Stop-Loss: Rs 705 Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors Mastek | CMP: Rs 2,223.8 On the daily chart, Mastek has been trending higher for the past one week and has outperformed broader market indices by consistently closing above the previous day’s high over the last three trading sessions, highlighting underlying strength. The stock has already confirmed a breakout from a triangle pattern on the daily chart, which is a positive technical development. Additionally, the Bollinger Bands have begun to expand, indicating an increase in volatility. For now, a sustained move above Rs 2,245 is required for bullish momentum to continue, which could drive prices towards the prior swing high zone of Rs 2,370–2,400, as long as the Rs 2,150 level remains protected on the downside. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,370, Rs 2,400 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,150 Dalmia Bharat | CMP: Rs 2,191.4 Dalmia Bharat has been forming a Cup and Handle pattern since October 2025. In the previous session, the stock gained over 1.5 percent and managed to close near the neckline around the Rs 2,200 level. A sustainable breakout above this zone could pave the way for a fresh rally. The stock continues to form higher highs and higher lows, indicating positive price action. Additionally, the consistent green histogram following a bullish crossover of the MACD provides double confirmation of the bullish outlook. For now, a decisive move above Rs 2,220 may trigger fresh buying interest, which can push prices towards Rs 2,400, the first target as per the length of the handle. On the downside, the Rs 2,110 level is expected to act as key support. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,400 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,110 JK Cement | CMP: Rs 5,891.5 In the previous session, JK Cement gained 1.84 percent, supported by the highest trading volumes seen since September 19, 2025. The stock has consistently held above the prior day’s low for the last five trading sessions, indicating buying from lower levels. Since November 2025, JK Cement has been trading within a rectangular range of Rs 5,361–6,030, suggesting a phase of accumulation. In the previous session, prices attempted a breakout from this range but failed to close above it. The RSI is currently hovering near 55, indicating the absence of a strong trending move. For now, a decisive breakout above Rs 6,030 could trigger fresh upside momentum towards the Rs 6,450 level, with Rs 5,790 acting as an important support. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 6,450 Stop-Loss: Rs 5,790 Aditya Thukral, Founder & Analyst of AT Research & Risk Managers Delhivery | CMP: Rs 384.85 Delhivery exhibited a box pattern, and a breakdown from this pattern was witnessed on January 12, accompanied by rising volumes. The stock is consistently trading below all its major exponential moving averages, namely the 10-day, 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day EMAs, all of which are sloping downwards. An established downtrend is evident, marked by the formation of lower highs and lower lows. Additionally, the stock has recorded its lowest close since July 3, 2025. A continuation of the downtrend is expected following the breakdown from the box pattern. Any minor bounce towards the previous support level of Rs 391 will act as a selling opportunity, as prior supports have turned into resistances. Sell Delhivery Futures on a rise around Rs 391, with a stop-loss at Rs 398, targeting Rs 377 over the next two weeks. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 377 Stop-Loss: Rs 398 Suzlon Energy | CMP: Rs 46.34 Suzlon entered a correction phase after forming a top around the Rs 86 level on September 12, 2024. The stock is consistently trading below all its major exponential moving averages—10-day, 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day EMAs—and has established a clear downtrend with the formation of lower highs and lower lows. Additionally, the stock has closed at its lowest level since June 6, 2024. With prices now moving towards the targets of a bearish flag pattern on the daily chart, and the breakdown occurring with rising volumes, the pace of the downtrend is accelerating due to falling trendlines. This presents a short-selling opportunity in the futures segment. Any minor bounce towards the previous support level of Rs 47.50 should be used as a selling opportunity, as it has now turned into resistance. Sell Suzlon Futures on a rise around Rs 47.50, with a stop-loss at Rs 48.60, targeting Rs 45.20 and Rs 43.50 over the next two weeks. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 45.20, Rs 43.50 Stop-Loss: Rs 48.60 Lodha Developers | CMP: Rs 979.3 Lodha has confirmed a medium-term downtrend with the break of the swing low of Rs 1,035.15, formed during the previous corrective leg. The stock is witnessing another leg of correction after forming a top near Rs 1,530. It is consistently trading below all its major exponential moving averages—10-day, 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day EMAs—all of which are sloping downward. The short-term downtrend has now extended into a medium-term downtrend, marked by lower highs and lower lows. Additionally, the stock has recorded its lowest close since December 29, 2023. The realty sector has remained under pressure and has been one of the biggest losers during the ongoing correction, underperforming for several months. A continuation of the downtrend is expected in this realty stock, given the established medium-term downtrend.

"Markets at three-month low: Analysts say Bank Nifty may continue to outperform Nifty, cite multiple tailwinds",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/markets-at-three-month-low-analysts-say-bank-nifty-may-continue-to-outperform-nifty-cite-multiple-tailwinds-13781950.html,"The Nifty Bank index has seen some correction in 2026 so far, declining nearly 2 percent after hitting a lifetime high earlier this month. However, the index is still outperforming the broader Nifty 50 index, which dropped more than 4 percent during the same period. Markets experts have highlighted reasons why the sectoral index remains comparatively resilient amid broader downturn in the stock markets, and what lies ahead. The Nifty Bank index fell 0.81 percent to close at 59,404.20 on January 20, extending decline for the second consecutive session. The index had earlier hit a fresh all-time high of 60,437.35 on January 5, before losing stream. Nifty 50 also had hit its lifetime high of 26,373.20 on January 5, before beginning to decline. The index dropped to a three-month low of 25,171.35, before recovering some losses to close at 25,232.50 on Tuesday. Why Bank Nifty shows resilience amid market downturn? Bank Nifty is exhibiting distinct relative outperformance against the broader market, largely driven by the robust momentum in PSU Banks amid strong quarterly earnings and a broad-based positive trend across the sector, said Santosh Meena, Head of Research at Swastika Investmart. Notably, the Nifty PSU Bank index hit a fresh 52-week high of 9,093.65 in the early trading hours of January 20, before erasing all gains and falling more than 1.3 percent. Renewed institutional interest, RBI's support The analyst added that this resilience is further underpinned by renewed institutional interest, as mutual funds identify attractive valuations within the banking space, coupled with the RBI's prudent measures to ensure adequate systemic liquidity. Notably, the Reserve Bank of India delivered four interest rate cuts in 2025, reducing the benchmark repurchase rate by a cumulative 125 basis points. In June last year, the Indian central cut the cash reserve ratio (CRR), which refers to the funds that banks are required to hold, by 100 basis points to 3 percent. ""Given these structural supports, the index is poised to remain range-bound in the near term, likely consolidating within the 58,700–60,400 zone as it digests recent gains and builds a base for the next move,"" according to the analyst. Strong balance sheets The fact that Bank Nifty has been relatively less affected in the face of the market correction is a sign that the banking sector has strong balance sheets, steady credit growth, as well as greater earnings visibility, said Pranav Koomar, Founder and CEO of PlusCash. He however cautioned investors, stating that some correction cannot be ruled out, especially in case the general market slide continues. “Nonetheless, any fall in Bank Nifty will probably be more limited in extent, except in case of a drastic macro or liquidity surprise,” he added. Harshal Dasani, Business Head at INVasset PMS, meanwhile said that the relative resilience of the index so far reflects composition rather than immunity. “Unlike the Nifty 50, which has meaningful exposure to global cyclicals and rate-sensitive pockets, this index is tilted toward businesses with steadier cash flows, lower balance-sheet stress, and more domestic demand visibility. That has helped cushion volatility even as the broader market corrected,” he said. Going ahead, the divergence may narrow, but not necessarily through a sharp drawdown, the analyst said. “If global cues remain mixed and earnings momentum softens, some mean reversion is possible. However, a decline matching the Nifty 50 would typically require either earnings downgrades or a macro shock, neither of which is clearly visible yet. In a sideways or mildly corrective market, such indices tend to consolidate rather than correct aggressively. Resilience may moderate, but a one-to-one fall with the benchmark is not a base-case scenario at this stage,” he added. Technical view on Bank Nifty Bank Nifty is still holding its major support zone near 58,650, while Nifty has already broken its crucial support of 25,350–25,400, turning structurally weak, said Drumil Vithlani, Technical Analyst at Bonanza. He added that Bank Nifty remains in a sideways-to-positive range, whereas Nifty has shifted to a clear short-term downtrend after rejection from all-time highs. Bank Nifty is trading near/above its 20-week EMA, showing demand at lower levels, while Nifty has closed below its key EMA, indicating selling pressure, he added. RSI of Bank Nifty is healthier and holding above neutral, whereas Nifty’s RSI is weakening, confirming relative underperformance, he further said. The analyst concluded that Bank Nifty is consolidating and showing resilience, supported by PSU banks, while Nifty has already broken key supports and looks comparatively weaker. Bank Nifty continues to show relative outperformance, maintaining a bullish structure despite mild resistance near 60,200, said Emkay Global Financial Services. A sustained move above this level may fuel further upside, while the 59,200–58,900 zone is expected to act as a strong support cushion, the brokerage said. Axis Securities meanwhile said that Bank Nifty is centered around the 60,000 level, which is acting as a key pivot for the current expiry. 59,500 is a strong support zone, supported by heavy Put open interest, while 60,000 remains the major resistance, marked by the highest Call open interest, according to the domestic brokerage. ""Bank Nifty exhibited relative resilience near 59,800–60,000, but hesitation around 60,000 underscores indecision in the banking complex. A break above 60,000 could revive short-term bullish sentiment, while a breach of 59,500–59,600 might signal extended consolidation,"" said Choice Broking.","A sustained move above this level may fuel further upside, while the 59,200–58,900 zone is expected to act as a strong support cushion, the brokerage said.","The analyst concluded that Bank Nifty is consolidating and showing resilience, supported by PSU banks, while Nifty has already broken key supports and looks comparatively weaker.","The Nifty Bank index has seen some correction in 2026 so far, declining nearly 2 percent after hitting a lifetime high earlier this month.","Strong balance sheets The fact that Bank Nifty has been relatively less affected in the face of the market correction is a sign that the banking sector has strong balance sheets, steady credit growth, as well as greater earnings visibility, said Pranav Koomar, Founder and CEO of PlusCash."

Aarti Surfactants and Tips Music shares meanwhile surged. The three companies had released their results on January 19. Havells India Q3 Results: Havells India shares declined more than 7 percent to close at Rs 1,344.90 apiece. This comes a day after the company reported a standalone net profit of Rs 301.36 crore for Q3 FY26, marking a nearly 7 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise from Rs 282.81 crore in Q3 FY25 but a 5 percent QoQ decline from Rs 317.48 crore in Q2 FY26. The firm’s revenue from operations meanwhile rose more than 14 percent YoY to Rs 5,573.44 crore during the quarter under review. Along with the Q3 results, Havells India announced an interim dividend of Rs 4 per equity share. The record date to determine the eligibility of the shareholders set to receive the payment has been set on January 23. The dividend will then be paid to the eligible shareholders on or before February 17. Brokerages on Havells: Motilal Oswal reiterated its 'Neutral' rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,590 apiece. This implies an upside potential of nearly 10 percent from the stock’s previous closing price of Rs 1447.1 apiece. The domestic brokerage said that the company’s Q3 results came in below its estimates, as margins remained under pressure across the C&W, Lloyd, and cable segments. “Going forward, the inventory situation of RAC, the implementation of price hikes due to new BEE norms, RM cost inflation, and growth in the C&W segment amid copper price fluctuations will be the key monitorables,” it added. JM Financial said that the firm’s adjusted PAT was a “shade below expectations”, while EBITDA was in-line and revenue was above estimate. “Our FY26E EPS estimate goes up by 3%, primarily on the back of an increase in revenue from C&W, while our FY27/28E EPS estimate is largely unchanged. We maintain BUY with a PT of INR 1,750 (unchanged), valuing Havells at 50x Dec’27E EPS,” the brokerage said. Nomura kept a ‘Buy’ call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 1,798 per share. This implies an upside potential of more than 24 percent from the stock’s previous closing price of Rs 1,447.1 apiece. The international brokerage said that the firm’s Q3 earnings beat Jefferies kept a ‘Hold’ call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 1,555 per share. This implies an upside potential of nearly 7.5 percent over the stock’s previous closing price. The international brokerage said that the firm’s strong cables and wires growth offset weakness in Lloyd & Lighting. Rising copper and aluminium prices may require calibrated price hikes, it added. Aarti Surfactants Q3 Results: Aarti Surfactants shares jumped 20 percent to hit the upper circuit at Rs 459.10 apiece on Tuesday.

Click to View More Outlook for January 21 Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities Bears resumed control as bulls were increasingly marginalised amid ongoing transatlantic trade tensions. Supports looked fragile as the Nifty kept breaking them on the back of strong institutional selling. Indicators remained in a bearish crossover and are approaching the oversold zone. On the daily chart, the index appears to be drifting towards the 200-DMA. Immediate support is seen around 25,100–25,150. If this level holds, a decent pullback can be expected. Rajesh Bhosale, Equity Technical Analyst, Angel One On the weekly expiry day, Nifty began on a negative note and as prices broke below key support levels, a cascading sell-off ensued, leading to sharp declines through the session. Eventually, Nifty ended the day with a loss of 1.38%, closing tad above the 25200 mark. Over the last 15 days, Nifty has erased more than 1,100 points and in the process has broken multiple key support levels, indicating that weakness may persist in the near term. On the daily chart, prices have slipped below the November swing low and also closed below the golden retracement level (61.8%) of the entire upmove from the September swing low near 24600. On the indicators front, the RSI Smoothened has entered the oversold zone below 25 for the first time since August; however, considering the broad-based nature of the sell-off, attempting to catch the bottom may be premature. From a levels perspective, prices are now at a knocking distance of the long-term 200-DSMA, with 25100–25000 emerging as a crucial support zone for the coming sessions. On the flip side, given the sharpness of the recent decline, identifying a precise resistance zone is challenging; nevertheless, the 25500–25600 region is likely to act as a stiff hurdle. While oscillators are deeply oversold and prices have approached long-term support levels ahead of the key Budget session, we would prefer to remain cautious and not rush to call a bottom until clear reversal signals or a base formation emerge.

"Broader markets extend losses, fall up to 3%: Nifty Midcap 100 goes below 100-DMA; Ola, Oberoi Realty among top losers",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/broader-markets-extend-losses-fall-up-to-1-7-nifty-midcap-100-goes-below-100-dma-ola-oberoi-realty-among-top-losers-13780937.html,"The broader markets extended their losses in Tuesday’s session, mirroring the decline in the benchmark indices, Sensex and Nifty. The Nifty Midcap 100 and Nifty Smallcap 100 underperformed the frontline indices, falling by up to 3 percent, while the benchmark Sensex and Nifty also traded lower. The Nifty Midcap 100 slipped below its 100-day moving average (DMA) to 57,898.65 during intraday trade, with Oberoi Realty and UPL emerging as the biggest laggards. Shares of real estate companies declined sharply on Monday, led by losses in Oberoi Realty, as investor sentiment turned weak following the company’s Q3 earnings. Oberoi Realty reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 622.64 crore for the October–December quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026. This represented a marginal year-on-year increase of 0.69 percent from Rs 618.38 crore reported in Q3 FY25, but an 18 percent quarter-on-quarter decline from Rs 760.26 crore recorded in the previous quarter (Q2 FY26). The Nifty Smallcap 100 index extended its losing streak for a third consecutive session, falling over 4 percent during the period. Newgen Software Technologies, Data Patterns (India), Ola Electric Mobility and Aditya Birla Real Estate emerged as major laggards in the index, with their shares declining by as much as 12 percent. Shares of Ola Electric Mobility slipped 5.5 percent to Rs 33.7, hitting their lowest level in nearly a month, after the electric vehicle maker announced the resignation of its Chief Financial Officer Harish Abichandani due to personal reasons. The company said Deepak Rastogi has been appointed as the new CFO with effect from January 20. The stock marked its tenth consecutive session of decline and has fallen 57.7 percent so far in 2025. N ArunaGiri, CEO of TrustLine Holdings, said ""It has been a one-way fall for the small-cap index since the start of November last year. At the index level, small caps are down over 11.5% since then. That alone looks painful, but the reality beneath the surface is far worse. Even in the current month, from January 1st, the small-cap index has fallen by about 7.5%. And this is only the aggregate picture. When we go deeper, the stock-specific carnage is severe. A large number of stocks are down 40–50%. In fact, one could argue that nearly half the market, particularly across the small-cap spectrum, has seen drawdowns of this magnitude."" ""The pain in mid caps is equally intense. Given the extent of the fall and the brutality of the correction, the obvious question arises: Has this become a buy-on-dips market? Unfortunately, the answer is no. Valuations remain meaningfully above historical averages. Before this correction, the small-cap index was trading at around 28–30x trailing earnings. Post the fall, valuations have moderated to about 25–26x, but this is still a huge premium to long-term averages. So at a broader market level, small and mid caps continue to look expensive, and it would be naïve to rule out more pain in the space. Does that mean investors should simply sit on the fence and wait for much lower levels? That approach is equally not prudent. At the stock-specific level, for truly bottom-up and selective investors, many compelling opportunities are emerging across small and mid caps, provided one is extremely choosy. In that sense, this is not a universal buy-on-dips market, nor is it a market to completely stay out of. It is a market that rewards selective bottom-up stock-specific approach. That, in essence, is the story emerging from the current small- and mid-cap carnage. Time to be choosy, selective and bottom-up,"" he added. Extending its previous day's decline, the Sensex tumbled 1,065.71 points, or 1.28 percent to settle at 82,180.47. During the day, it dropped 1,235.6 points, or 1.48 percent to 82,010.58. The Nifty tanked 353 points, or 1.38 percent to end at 25,232.50, marking its steepest single day decline since April 7, 2025. The sharp fall dragged the index to its lowest closing level since October 15, 2025.

Technical view on Bank Nifty: Bank Nifty continues to show relative outperformance, maintaining a bullish structure despite mild resistance near 60,200, said Emkay Global Financial Services. A sustained move above this level may fuel further upside, while the 59,200–58,900 zone is expected to act as a strong support cushion, the brokerage said. Axis Securities meanwhile said that Bank Nifty is centered around the 60,000 level, which is acting as a key pivot for the current expiry. 59,500 is a strong support zone, supported by heavy Put open interest, while 60,000 remains the major resistance, marked by the highest Call open interest, according to the domestic brokerage. ""Bank Nifty exhibited relative resilience near 59,800–60,000, but hesitation around 60,000 underscores indecision in the banking complex.

Pure cement realizations declined 5.3% QoQ mainly due to weak prices in the eastern region. Raw material costs remained elevated despite access to better-priced slag under long-term contracts, while power and fuel costs declined 9% YoY, aided by higher share of domestic coal in the mix. Consequently, EBITDA/t increased 39% YoY to Rs763 (vs. PLe of Rs775). While the recent uptick in pet coke prices poses a risk to margins in Q4FY26, management expects overall fuel costs to remain largely stable, aided by higher domestic coal usage, while cement price hikes implemented in January are holding so far amid improving demand. The Vadraj acquisition remains on track, with commissioning expected by Q1FY28, taking Nuvoco’s total cement capacity to ~35mtpa. Outlook We raise our EBITDA estimates by 2% on slightly higher volumes and expect it to deliver EBITDA CAGR of 19% over FY25-28E. The stock is trading at EV of 8.2x/6.8x FY27E/FY28E EBITDA.

Despite having negative seasonality in Capco, the organic growth (0.6% QoQ CC) was positive and multi-faceted across business units, including Fin. Services. However, the organic growth momentum is less likely to sustain in Q4 due to execution deferment in one of the large deals, especially the NN component. The softness in business is also baked into Q4 organic guidance of -1.5 to +0.5 QoQ CC (our assumption), which translates to twomonth inorganic contribution of +1.5% QoQ. Again, the organic guidance comes at the back of improving Capco seasonality in Q4, which is little discouraging. Although 9MFY26 large deals (+77% YoY) and bookings (+25% YoY) have improved, the execution remains a challenge.

Hold BHEL; target of Rs 245: Prabhudas Lilladher,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/hold-bhel-target-of-rs-245-prabhudas-lilladher-13781008.html,"Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on BHEL We revise our FY26E/FY27E EPS estimate by -18.9%/-4.3% factoring in slower execution pace amid strong order backlog, normalized provision, and moderate order inflow momentum. BHEL delivered a revenue growth of 16.4% YoY with EBITDA margin expanding by 225bps YoY aided by lower other expenses (vs higher base in Q3FY25) partially offset by decrease in GM. Execution in the Power segment remained slower, translating into ~13% YoY revenue growth despite a healthy Rs1.7trn order backlog, supported by recent Rs66.5bn EPC package win (1×800MW) from NTPC, reinforcing BHEL’s positioning in the thermal space. In contrast, the industry segment continued to deliver strong execution with revenue up 27.4% YoY, driven by accelerating traction across transmission, transportation, oil & gas and defense verticals; however, order inflows in Industry moderated sharply to Rs16.3bn (vs. ~Rs57bn in Q3FY25 on a high base). While near-term challenges around execution intensity persist, a robust pipeline and a gradual shift towards non-Power opportunities with rise in public/private capex, BHEL is well placed for sustained growth. Outlook The stock is currently trading at a P/E of 28.2x/20.3x on FY27/28E earnings. We maintain our rating to ‘Hold’ and value a stock at a PE of 22x Sep’27E (same as earlier) with a revised TP of Rs245 (Rs250 earlier).

Hold LTIMindtree; target of Rs 6000: Prabhudas Lilladher,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/hold-ltimindtree-target-of-rs-6000-prabhudas-lilladher-13781007.html,"Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on LTIMindtree The revenue growth (+2.4% QoQ CC) was above our estimates (2.0% QoQ CC), aided by ramp up of large deals and pass-throughs. Beyond selective pockets the growth was muted, especially BFSI and CMT verticals. The deal signing activities remain strong in these verticals, it will take few more quarters to achieve the normalized revenue run-rate for top marquee accounts. Although top 5/10 accounts de-grew 2.9%/1.1% TTM (vs decline of 5.2%/2.2% LQ), the pace of deceleration has reduced sequentially, implies recovery post productivity benefits. The management was confident of executing even better and aspired to achieve near to double-digit YoY growth in Q4. The company’s participation in vendor consolidation deals along with continued momentum in NN wins translate to a better growth visibility. The recent Indialed NN deal (CBDT) would itself contribute ~80-90bps to the topline in FY27. On margins, it was able to sustain margins at a Q2 high base despite having pass-throughs, aided by internal margin program (fit-for-future) and INR depreciation supporting margins in Q3. Outlook We are keeping our margin estimates largely unchanged as the wage hike impact would keep margins under pressure. We are baking CC revenue growth of 5.4%/8.9%/9.5% YoY in FY26E/FY27E/FY28E, while keeping our margins at 15.3%/15.6%/15.9%. With that our EPS sees an upgrade of ~2% each in FY27E/FY28E. We assign 25x PE to FY28E EPS for a TP of 6,000, full valuations. Retain HOLD.
