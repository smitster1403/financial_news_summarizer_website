Musk says he plans to sue Apple for not featuring X or Grok among its top apps,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/musk-says-he-plans-to-sue-apple-for-not-featuring-x-or-grok-among-its-top-apps-2025-08-12/,"Billionaire SpaceX, Tesla and X owner Elon Musk says he plans to sue Apple for not featuring X and its Grok artificial intelligence chatbot app in its top recommended apps in its App Store. Musk posted the comments on X late Monday, saying, “Hey @Apple App Store, why do you refuse to put either X or Grok in your ‘Must Have’ section when X is the #1 news app in the world and Grok is #5 among all apps? Are you playing politics? What gives? Inquiring minds want to know.” Grok is owned by Musk's artificial intelligence startup xAI. Musk went on to say that “Apple is behaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store, which is an unequivocal antitrust violation. xAI will take immediate legal action.” He gave no further details. There was no immediate comment from Apple, which has faced various allegations of antitrust violations in recent years. A federal judge recently found that Apple violated a court injunction in an antitrust case filed by Fortnite maker Epic Games. Regulators of the 27-nation European Union fined Apple 500 million euros in April for breaking competition rules by preventing app makers from pointing users to cheaper options outside its App Store. Last year, the EU fined the U.S. tech giant nearly $2 billion for unfairly favoring its own music streaming service by forbidding rivals like Spotify from telling users how they could pay for cheaper subscriptions outside of iPhone apps. As of early Tuesday, the top app in Apple's App Store was TikTok, followed by Tinder, Duolingo, YouTube and Bumble. Open AI's ChatGPT was ranked 7th.

Australia's central bank cuts interest rate for third time this year to 3.6%,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/australias-central-bank-cuts-interest-rate-for-third-time-this-year-to-36-2025-08-12/,"MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Australia’s central bank on Tuesday reduced its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point for a third time this year to 3.6%, with inflation tamed and economic growth stalling. The Reserve Bank of Australia reduced its cash rate from 3.85%. The rate was cut from 4.1% in May. The reduction from 4.35% at its February board meeting was Australia’s first rate cut since October 2020. The new rate is the lowest since March 2023 and the cut was widely anticipated as inflation continues to fall. The bank's governor, Michele Bullock, said international trade policy developments were expected to have an adverse effect on global economic activity. ""Uncertainty in the world economy remains elevated. There is a little more clarity on the scope and scale of U.S. tariffs and policy responses in other countries, suggesting that more extreme outcomes are likely to be avoided,"" Bullock said in a statement. The bank adjusts interest rates to steer inflation toward a target band of between 2% and 3%. In May, annual inflation fell to 2.1% from 2.4% a month earlier. The trimmed mean — a gauge of underlying inflation that is the bank’s preferred measure — fell from 2.8% in April to 2.4%. Inflation has gradually declined since it peaked at 7.8% in the last quarter of 2022. The bank was widely expected to cut the rate at its last board meeting in July. But directors voted 6-to-3 to wait to see inflation data for the June quarter. That data revealed that trimmed mean inflation was 2.7% in the three months through June, down from 2.9% in the March quarter. The board's decision to cut interest rates on Tuesday was unanimous. Treasurer Jim Chalmers said curbing inflation to within the target range had given the central bank confidence to cut interest rates three times in six months. “This is very welcome relief for millions of Australians,” Chalmers told reporters. “It will put more money in the pockets of people who are under pressure.” The economic boost of a rate cut comes after growth slowed to a sluggish 0.2% in the three months through March and 1.3% for the year. The economy grew 0.6% in the preceding December quarter. The bank has attempted to gradually rein in inflation without tipping the economy into recession or causing large-scale job losses. Unemployment rose to 4.3% in June from 4.1% where it had held steady since February. The jobless rate was at 4.0% in January. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

Asian shares advance on relief that Trump is delaying higher China tariffs,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/asian-shares-advance-on-relief-that-trump-is-delaying-higher-china-tariffs-2025-08-11/,"TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares mostly advanced Tuesday after President Donald Trump delayed raising tariffs on China for another 90 days. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 jumped 2.6% to 42,942.14, topping its past all-time record. Toyota Motor Corp.'s shares surged 3.3% and other heavyweight shares also saw big gains. Hong Kong's Hang Seng slipped nearly 0.2% to 24,865.07, while the Shanghai Composite edged up 0.3% to 3,658.62. Trump signed an executive order Monday putting on hold a possible showdown between the world’s two major economies to allow time for more talks on a broad trade agreement. Without an extension, taxes on Chinese imports might have jumped from an already high 30%. Beijing could have responded by raising retaliatory levies on U.S. exports to China but it issued a similar statement about the extension of the tariff pause. The reprieve makes room for a possible deal with Trump, but it also prolongs the uncertainty that has bedeviled companies since the president began escalating his trade war. “The extension isn’t about goodwill; it’s about keeping oxygen in the room for deals that matter,” Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. Elsewhere in Asia, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 was little changed, rising less than 0.1% to 8,852.80. South Korea’s Kospi added 0.6% to 3,227.10. On Monday, U.S. stocks edged back from their record highs ahead of an update on U.S. inflation. The S&P 500 dipped 0.3% to 6,373.45 after flirting with its all-time high, which was set two weeks ago. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.5% to 43,975.09, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.3% to 21,385.40. The highlight of this week for Wall Street will likely arrive on Tuesday, when the government will report how bad inflation was across the country in July. Economists expect it to show U.S. consumers had to pay prices for groceries, gasoline and other costs of living that were 2.8% higher than a year earlier, a slight acceleration from June’s 2.7% inflation. Inflation has remained above 2%, even if it has improved substantially from its peak above 9% three years ago. And the worry is that President Donald Trump’s tariffs  could push prices still higher. That in turn is raising fears about a potential, worst-case scenario called “stagflation” where the economy stagnates but inflation remains high. The Federal Reserve  has no good tool to fix both at once, and it would need to concentrate on either the job market or inflation first. But helping one of those areas by moving interest rates would likely hurt the other. A top Fed official, Michelle Bowman, said on Saturday  that she believes the job market is the bigger concern. She is still backing three cuts to interest rates by the Fed this year following this month’s stunning, weaker-than-expected report on the U.S. job market. Trump has also been angrily calling for cuts to interest rates to support the economy. Other Fed officials, led by Chair Jerome Powell, have been more hesitant. Powell has said he wants to wait for more data about how Trump’s tariffs are affecting inflation before the Fed makes its next move, and Tuesday’s update on the consumer price index may offer a big clue about that. The price of gold eased after Trump said he would not place tariffs on the metal. That followed a brouhaha Friday in the gold market after the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol seemed to rule that some kinds of gold bars coming from Switzerland would face a tariff. That caused a disconnect between the prices of gold trading in New York versus in London, but the market has since calmed. Gold for December delivery settled at $3,404.70 per ounce in New York, down 2.5%. Early Tuesday, it was down 0.1% at $3,399.70. In other dealings early Tuesday, benchmark U.S. crude rose 17 cents to $64.13 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, added 21 cents to $66.84 a barrel. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar edged up to 148.44 Japanese yen from 148.15 yen. The euro cost $1.1621, up from $1.1618. ___ AP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed.

"An explosion at a plant owned by US Steel, an icon of American industry, has killed 2. What to know",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/an-explosion-at-a-plant-owned-by-us-steel-an-icon-of-american-industry-has-killed-2-what-to-know-2025-08-11/,"An explosion at a U.S. Steel plant south of Pittsburgh killed two people and injured 10 others. The CEO has vowed to find out what caused Monday's blast while union officials say representatives will work to ensure a thorough investigation. The plant, Clairton Coke Works, is one of four major plants in Pennsylvania owned by U.S. Steel, an icon of the domestic steel industry and American industrialization for over a century. The plant is in the Mon Valley, a region of the state synonymous with steel. Here's what to know about the explosion: Allegheny County Emergency Services said a fire at the plant started around 10:50 a.m. The explosion, which was followed by several smaller blasts, sent black smoke spiraling into air. The blast could be felt in the nearby community and prompted county officials to warn residents to stay away from the scene so emergency workers could respond. One worker was rescued from the smoldering rubble hours later. Allegheny Health Network said it treated seven patients from the plant and discharged five within a few hours. The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center said it was treating three patients at UPMC Mercy, the region’s only level one trauma and burn center. The plant converts coal to coke, a key component in the steel-making process. It’s the largest coking operation in North America. Coke is made by baking coal in special ovens for hours at high temperatures, which removes impurities that could otherwise weaken steel. The process creates what’s known as coke gas — made up of a lethal mix of methane, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. Clairton Coke Works, which has 1,400 workers, has had explosions and fatal accidents before: 1. In September 2009, a maintenance worker was killed in an explosion 2. In July 2010, an explosion injured 14 employees and six contractors. Afterward, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined U.S. Steel and a subcontractor $175,000 for safety violations. U.S. Steel appealed its citations and $143,500 in fines, which were later reduced under a settlement agreement. 3. The last death at the plant was in 2014, according to online OSHA records of workplace fatalities. A worker was burned and died after falling into a trench. 4. In February, a problem with a battery at the plant led to a “buildup of combustible material” that ignited, causing an audible “boom,” officials said. Two workers received first aid treatment but were not seriously injured. After Monday's blast, the county health department initially told residents within 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) of the plant to remain indoors and close all windows and doors. The department lifted the advisory after its monitors didn’t detect levels of soot or sulfur dioxide above federal standards. In 2018, a Christmas Eve fire damaged pollution control equipment and led to repeated releases of sulfur dioxide, according to a subsequent lawsuit. The fire prompted Allegheny County to warn residents to limit outdoor activities. Residents said it was hard to breathe for weeks afterward and that the air felt acidic and smelled like rotten eggs. U.S. Steel settled the lawsuit last year with an agreement to spend $19.5 million in equipment upgrades and $5 million on local clean air efforts and programs. Dr. Deborah Gentile, the medical director of Community Partners in Asthma Care, studied asthma levels after the fire and found twice as many patients sought medical treatment. One of her colleagues found patients living near the plant had increased symptoms of asthma, including coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath. In 2019, U.S. Steel agreed to settle a lawsuit regarding air pollution from Clairton for $8.5 million. U.S. Steel has been a symbol of industrialization since it was founded in 1901 by J.P. Morgan, Andrew Carnegie and others. It's been the icon of the American steel industry that once dominated the world market until Japan, then China, became preeminent steelmakers over the past 40 years. Its steel has helped build everything from the United Nations building in New York City to the New Orleans Superdome. Japan's largest steelmaker, Nippon Steel, in June finalized a deal to acquire U.S. Steel for nearly $15 billion. The agreement took more than a year to come together after U.S. Steel shareholders approved it as the parties surmounted obstacles created by national security concerns and presidential politics in a premier battleground state. The deal includes what is known as a “golden share” provision that gives the U.S. government the power to appoint a board member and a say in company decisions that affect domestic steel production and competition with overseas producers. The combined company is the world’s fourth-largest steelmaker in an industry now dominated by China. Before you consider JPMorgan Chase & Co., you'll want to hear this.

Officials are still investigating the cause of a Pennsylvania steel plant explosion that killed 2,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/officials-are-still-investigating-the-cause-of-a-pennsylvania-steel-plant-explosion-that-killed-2-2025-08-11/,"CLAIRTON, Pa. (AP) — An explosion rocked a steel plant outside Pittsburgh on Monday, leaving two dead and 10 others injured, including a person who was rescued from the smoldering rubble after hours of being trapped. The explosion sent black smoke spiraling into the midday sky in the Mon Valley, a region of the state synonymous with steel for more than a century. Allegheny County Emergency Services said a fire at the plant in Clairton started late Monday morning. Officials said they had not isolated the cause of the blast. The rumbling from the explosion, and several smaller blasts that followed, jolted the community about 15 miles (24 kilometers) southeast of Pittsburgh. “It felt like thunder,” Zachary Buday, a construction worker near the scene, told WTAE-TV. “Shook the scaffold, shook my chest, and shook the building."" At a news conference, Scott Buckiso, U.S. Steel’s chief manufacturing officer, did not give details about the damage or casualties, and said they were still trying to determine what happened. He said the company, now a subsidiary of Japan-based Nippon Steel Corp., is working with authorities. Allegheny Health Network said it treated seven patients from the plant and discharged five within a few hours. University of Pittsburgh Medical Center said it is treating three patients at UPMC Mercy, the region’s only level one trauma and burn center. According to the company, the plant has approximately 1,400 workers. In a statement, the United Steelworkers, which represents many of the Clairton plant’s workers, said it had representatives on the ground at the plant and would work to ensure there is a thorough investigation. David Masur, executive director of PennEnvironment, an environmental group that has sued U.S. Steel over pollution, said there needed to be “a full, independent investigation into the causes of this latest catastrophe and a re-evaluation as to whether the Clairton plant is fit to keep operating.” U.S. Steel CEO David B. Burritt said the company would investigate. It's not the first explosion at the plant. A maintenance worker was killed in a blast in September 2009. In July 2010, another explosion injured 14 employees and six contractors. According to online OSHA records of workplace fatalities, the last death at the plant was in 2014, when a worker was burned and died after falling into a trench.

In June, U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel announced they had finalized a “historic partnership,” a deal that gives the U.S. government a say in some matters and comes a year and a half after the Japanese company first proposed its nearly $15 billion buyout of the iconic American steelmaker. The pursuit by Nippon Steel for the Pittsburgh-based company was buffeted by national security concerns and presidential politics in a premier battleground state, dragging out the transaction for more than a year after U.S. Steel shareholders approved it. ___ Levy reported from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; Casey reported from Boston and Whittle reported from Portland, Maine.

Bolivia's election may spell the end of its long-ruling left. Here's what to know,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/bolivias-election-may-spell-the-end-of-its-long-ruling-left-heres-what-to-know-2025-08-11/,"LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) — For most of Renan Aliaga’s adult life, a single name dominated the politics of Bolivia: Evo Morales. Morales, a former union leader for coca farmers, founded the Andean nation's most successful political party and transformed Bolivia over three consecutive terms marked by political stability and economic growth. But when Aliaga goes to the polls on Sunday to vote for Bolivia's next president, he won’t see Morales' name on the ballot after electoral authorities excluded him. In fact, for the first time in two decades, Aliaga won’t see any big name from the governing Movement Toward Socialism, or MAS, party that Morales founded — not even President Luis Arce, Morales' protege-turned-rival, who withdrew from the race over his failure to halt an economic tailspin. Under MAS, Bolivia enjoyed years of a fixed exchange rate, low inflation and subsidized energy. Now, high inflation, a scarcity of imported goods and fuel shortages have beset the country. Arce handed the reins to a little-known minister, Eduardo Del Castillo. The main options remaining include a conservative businessman and right-wing former president — both of whom have run and lost three times before — and a young leftist Senate leader. Unsatisfied, Aliaga, a 39-year-old bus driver and former MAS voter, says he'll make a last-minute decision. “The right wing had its chance, and it was a disaster,” he said, recalling the hardship of the 1990s, when Bolivia became a poster child for free-market economics and the two right-wing front-runners — businessman Samuel Doria Medina and ex-President Jorge “Tuto” Quiroga — built their careers. “But the left wing has proven to be the same, or worse,” Aliaga said, referring to how the MAS strategy of nationalizing resources and redistributing tax receipts sputtered out with the end of the commodities boom. The main issues in this hotly contested election are Bolivia's long-standing leftist economic model, its democratic integrity and the livelihoods of millions of people undergoing the country's worst financial crisis in four decades. “This seems the end of the cycle not only for MAS, but for an entire model of government,” Bolivia political analyst Verónica Rocha said. Tensions within MAS can be traced to Morales' disputed 2019 reelection. Protests erupted and the leftist leader resigned under pressure from the military. He fled into exile and right-wing Senator Jeanine Áñez took office in what many view as a coup. Violent clashes between protesters and security forces killed at least 37 people. Morales returned to Bolivia following the 2020 election victory of his former finance minister, Arce. But their competing ambitions collided when Morales announced his intention to return to politics. Lawmakers loyal to Morales deprived Arce’s government of its majority. Judges answering to Arce ordered Morales’ arrest over his sexual relationship with a 15-year-old girl and barred his 2025 presidential candidacy on account of his past terms. “MAS torpedoed its own chances of winning this election,” said Gustavo Flores-Macías, a professor of government and public policy at Cornell University. A young vice president, Quiroga became interim leader in 2001 when then President Hugo Banzer, Bolivia’s former military dictator, resigned because of terminal cancer with a year left in his term. Ever since, Quiroga has yearned for a term of his own. He ran three times — twice against Morales in 2005 and 2014. Now 65, he’s hoping the fourth time’s the charm. Doria Medina, 66, a former minister of planning from 1991-1993 made his fortune in cement and owns Bolivia's Burger King franchise. Dubbed the “eternal candidate,” he lost to Morales in 2005, 2009 and 2014, as Bolivia’s natural gas windfall, underwritten by public investment and generous subsidies, buoyed the union leader's popularity. When commodity prices slumped and gas production plummeted, Morales’ “economic miracle” went bust. Now once-routine errands have turned into nightmares as Bolivians wait in fuel lines that wrap around city blocks, run from pharmacy to pharmacy in search of medicines and queue for subsidized bread that has shrunk to almost half its normal size. This may give the opposition its first real shot at power in two decades. Yet Bolivians interviewed across the administrative capital of La Paz expressed not only frustration with the MAS party, but also disappointment in the right-wing establishment. “If people vote for the right, it's because they're resigned to it as the only alternative,” said Bolivian author Quya Reyna. “These are recycled politicians from the 1990s era of privatization."" Doria Medina and Quiroga vow to slash fuel subsidies, dismantle inefficient state-owned companies, let foreign investors mine Bolivia’s abundant lithium reserves and reorient the nation's foreign policy toward the United States after years of its alignment with China and Russia. Graffiti sprayed across La Paz reads “100 days, dammit"" — Doria Medina's pledge to fix fuel shortages and stabilize the exchange rate within his first 100 days. Motorists waiting for hours to get gas find themselves facing billboards of Quiroga promising “No more lines!” If no candidate wins a majority of the vote, a runoff between the top two finishers will be held on Oct. 19. Voter cynicism is widespread, with many Bolivians saying that they have no faith in any of the candidates to improve their lives. Longtime MAS voters wary of austerity under a right-wing president aren't sure where to turn. Some initially pinned their hopes on 36-year-old Senate President Andrónico Rodríguez, a coca-farming union activist who could have appealed to Indigenous communities looking for the kind of representation they found under Morales. But Morales branded Rodríguez a traitor for advancing his own candidacy. The Senate leader has made few public appearances since. A rare centrist candidate, lawmaker Rodrigo Paz and his media-savvy running mate, ex-Police Captain Edman Lara, have recently energized young voters with TikTok videos from the campaign trail. With Doria Medina and Quiroga neck and neck, Paz could play kingmaker. But their Christian Democratic Party's blistering attacks on both MAS and the right-wing have left some voters without a clear sense of where they stand. “We've all been raised on politicians' broken promises,” said Irma Marín, 38, shouting to be heard over the crowd at a Paz-Lara campaign rally Sunday. “I'm not sure who to trust.” Facing an arrest warrant, Morales, 66, has been holed up for months in his tropical stronghold of Chapare. His followers staged raucous protests against his removal from the race, blocking key roads and confronting police in clashes in June that killed four officers and four civilians. Morales is urging voters to register their rage by casting null-and-void ballots. “Null votes signal that these elections are not legitimate and the next government of Bolivia won't be legitimate,” said Chris Velasco, an organizer close to Morales. “That will mean political instability, social instability.” Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

Cambodian migrant workers face an uncertain future as Thai border conflict drives them home,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/cambodian-migrant-workers-face-an-uncertain-future-as-thai-border-conflict-drives-them-home-2025-08-11/,"KAMRIENG, Cambodia (AP) — Hundreds of thousands of Cambodian migrant workers have been heading home from Thailand as the two countries work to keep a ceasefire in armed clashes along their border. Tensions between the countries have escalated due to disputes over pockets of land along their 800-kilometer (500-mile) border. A five-day clash in July left at least 43 people dead and displaced more than 260,000 in both Southeast Asian nations. A fragile ceasefire brokered by Malaysia, with backing from the U.S. and China, appears to be holding while officials try to resolve issues underlying the conflict. The retreat has left many of the workers streaming back to Cambodia wondering how to get by after they left jobs that enabled them to send money back to their families. Kri Phart, a 56-year-old poultry worker, said he began packing after reading a post by Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet on Facebook urging migrants to return to Cambodia. “I have no idea if the fighting will really stop and with fewer and fewer Cambodians in Thailand, I got nervous,” said Kri Phart, seated on a stoop with two big bags of belongings and a big electric fan. “I didn’t want to be the last Cambodian migrant in Thailand.” “I got scared because of the border conflict,” said Kri Phart, one of thousands of Cambodians streaming shoulder-to-shoulder through the Daung International Border Gate last week, hauling rainbow colored bags, appliances and even guitars in the 40 Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) heat. “Many of the Cambodians I knew working in Thailand ran away. Everyday more and more of us fled,” he said. The reasons driving Cambodians to flee Thailand are varied. Human rights activists reported that some migrant workers had been attacked by gangs of young Thais. Others were alarmed by unsubstantiated rumors that the Cambodian government would seize their land and revoke their citizenships if they didn’t return home by mid-August. Cambodia’s Ministry of Labor and Vocational Training estimates 1.2 million Cambodians were working in Thailand when the border disputes began to escalate in June. Estimates vary, but Sun Mesa, a ministry spokesman said at least 780,000 — about 65% — have returned to Cambodia. He said the workers could find jobs with equal pay and benefits back home. Many of those who were driven by poverty or climate change to leave for work in Thailand expressed doubts. “Now that I am back, there is going to be no income for a while and this will really put my family in a bad situation,” said Thouk Houy, 26, who left a job at a leather factory south of Bangkok that enabled her to send $70 to $100 a month back to her parents. “I'm the last of my siblings who is still single, meaning it's my responsibility to support my parents. I don’t know how I can do that now that I am back home,"" she said. Minor spats between Cambodian and Thai workers at the factory and her mother's nightly pleas for her to go home were factors behind her decision to leave, she said. Handing over her belongings to be strapped into the back of a precariously packed van, Thouk Houy said the clincher was a claim by influential former Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, father of the current prime minister, Hun Manet, that Thailand was preparing to invade. “Now that I'm home, what will I do to make a living?” she said. Migrant workers fill vital roles in Thailand's farming, construction and manufacturing industries. They also send home close to $3 billion in remittances each year, according to labor ministry data. The loss of that income can be devastating for families relying on it to manage big debts, said Nathan Green, an assistant professor of geography at the National University of Singapore. “These kinds of conflicts demonstrate how precarious migrant livelihoods are in Cambodia,” Green said. An overseas advocacy group, the Khmer Movement for Democracy, has urged the government to defer loan payments and provide incentives for companies to hire returning migrants. “Without economic safeguards, families of returning migrants will not be able to repay their debts and financial institutions will be at their throats,” said Mu Sochua, the group's president. “We are talking about the poorest of the poor, who will be deprived of incomes.” Meng Yeam, who was trying to wave down a taxi while keeping an eye on his belongings, said he managed to send his family back home 20,000 baht (roughly $600) while working as a manager at a rubber factory in eastern Thailand’s Chonburi Province. More than 90% of the Cambodians working in the factory have left, the 32-year-old said. Meng Yeam said he expected his family to be okay, though it won’t be able to save as much as it did while he was working in Thailand. And he was glum about the prospects for things to return to normal. “Cambodia and Thailand need each other to do well, but for now, it seems like we just cannot get along,” Meng Yeam said. “I hope we can work in Thailand again one day, but who knows, maybe I will be retired by the time we stop fighting.” ___ Sopheng Cheang reported from Phnom Penh, Cambodia.

South Korean President Lee will travel to Washington for Aug. 25 meeting with Trump,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/south-korean-president-lee-will-travel-to-washington-for-aug-25-meeting-with-trump-2025-08-11/,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s new President Lee Jae Myung will travel to Washington later this month to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump, Lee’s office said Tuesday, for talks on trade and defense cooperation in the face of nuclear-armed North Korea and other threats. Their Aug. 25 summit will follow a July trade deal in which Washington agreed to cut its reciprocal tariff on South Korea to 15% from the initially proposed 25% and to apply the same reduced rate to South Korean cars, the country’s top export to the United States. South Korea also agreed to purchase $100 billion in U.S. energy and invest $350 billion in the country, and Lee and Trump may discuss how the investment package will be structured and managed. The talks are expected to cover expanding cooperation in key industries such as semiconductors, batteries and shipbuilding, Lee’s spokesperson Kang Yu-jung said. Lee, a liberal who won an early election in June to replace ousted conservative Yoon Suk Yeol, has made the economy his top priority, aiming to shield the trade-dependent nation from the shocks of Trump’s tariff hikes and his demands that allies cut reliance on Washington and shoulder more of their own defense costs. Lee's meeting with Trump comes amid concerns in Seoul that the Trump administration could shake up the decades-old alliance by demanding higher payments for the U.S. troop presence in South Korea and possibly move to reduce it as Washington shifts more focus on China. Lee and Trump will discuss strengthening the allies’ defense posture against growing North Korean threats, and also developing the partnership into a “future-oriented, comprehensive strategic alliance” to address the changing international security and economic environment, according to Kang, who didn’t elaborate on the specific issues to be addressed. Dating back to his first term, Trump has regularly called for South Korea to pay more for the 28,500 American troops stationed on its soil. Recent comments by key Trump administration officials, including Undersecretary of Defense Elbridge Colby, have also suggested a desire to restructure the alliance, which some experts say could potentially affect the size and role of U.S. forces in South Korea. Under this approach, South Korea would take a greater role in countering North Korean threats while U.S. forces focus more on China, possibly leaving Seoul to face reduced benefits but increased costs and risks, experts say. In a meeting with South Korean reporters last week, Gen. Xavier Brunson, commander of U.S. Forces Korea, stressed the need to “modernize” the alliance to address the evolving security environment, including North Korea’s expanding nuclear program, its deepening alignment with Russia, and what he called Chinese threats to a “free and open Indo-Pacific.” When asked about a potential reduction in U.S. troops in South Korea, Brunson emphasized capabilities over numbers, highlighting advanced systems like fifth-generation fighters, and also stressed strategic flexibility, citing the recent deployment of Patriot air defense systems from South Korea to the Middle East. “What’s being asked of Korea is to be stronger against DPRK — that we might have the flexibility as we modernize our alliance so that we could go do other things,” Brunson said, using the initials of North Korea’s formal name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. During his first term, Trump suspended U.S. military exercises with South Korea while pursuing diplomacy with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. They met three times in 2018 and 2019 but their diplomacy quickly collapsed over disagreements about exchanging the release of U.S.-led sanctions against the North and the North’s steps to wind down its nuclear and missile program. Kim has since suspended virtually all diplomacy with Washington and Seoul while accelerating the expansion of his weapons program. His foreign policy priority is now Russia, which he has supplied with weapons and troops to help prolong Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Kim’s powerful sister recently dismissed Washington and Seoul’s stated desires to restart diplomacy aimed at defusing the North’s nuclear program, indicating that Pyongyang feels no urgency to resume diplomacy with South Korea and the U.S. anytime soon. Tensions on the peninsula could rise again later this month, when South Korea and the United States proceed with their annual large-scale combined military exercises, which begin on Aug. 18. North Korea labels the allies’ joint drills as invasion rehearsals and often uses them as a pretext to dial up military demonstrations and weapons tests aimed at advancing its nuclear program.

Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani and agent accused of sabotaging $240M Hawaii real estate project,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/dodgers-star-shohei-ohtani-and-agent-accused-of-sabotaging-240m-hawaii-real-estate-project-2025-08-11/,"A Hawaii real estate investor and broker are suing Shohei Ohtani, claiming the Los Angeles Dodgers star and his agent got them fired from a $240 million luxury housing development on the Big Island’s coveted Hapuna Coast that they brought him in to endorse. According to the lawsuit filed in Hawaii Circuit Court on Friday, Ohtani’s agent, Nez Balelo, increasingly demanded concessions from developer Kevin J. Hayes Sr. and real estate broker Tomoko Matsumoto before demanding that their business partner, Kingsbarn Realty Capital, drop them from the deal. “Balelo and Otani, who were brought into the venture solely for Otani’s promotional and branding value, exploited their celebrity leverage to destabilize and ultimately dismantle Plaintiffs’ role in the project — for no reason other than their own financial self-interest,” the lawsuit claims. The suit accuses Ohtani and Balelo of tortious interference and unjust enrichment. Hayes, a developer with 40 years of experience, and Matsumoto, who was to be the listing agent for the houses averaging $17.3 million each, say that Ohtani and Balelo also tried to undermine their interests in a second, neighboring venture. A spokesman for Balelo's agency, CAA Baseball, declined comment. Attempts to reach Kingsbarn officials for comment were not immediately successful. “This case is about abuse of power,” the lawsuit says. “Defendants used threats and baseless legal claims to force a business partner to betray its contractual obligations and strip Plaintiffs of the very project they conceived and built. “Defendants must be held accountable for their actions, not shielded by fame or behind-the-scenes agents acting with impunity. Plaintiffs bring this suit to expose Defendants’ misconduct and to ensure that the rules of contract, fair dealing, and accountability apply equally to all — celebrity or not.” Ohtani, 31, arrived from Japan in 2018 as perhaps the most heralded international star in baseball history, with an ability to both pitch and hit that made him doubly valuable to his team. A five-time All-Star and three-time Most Valuable Player, he signed a record 10-year, $700-million contract with the Dodgers before last season and helped the team win the 2024 World Series. Investment materials for The Vista at Mauna Kea Resort, which remained online on Monday night, listed Hayes and Matsumoto as part of the management team, along with Kingsbarn. It called Ohtani “Japan's Babe Ruth” and the “1st Resident,” giving him top billing ahead of the iconic Mauna Kea Resort, “one of the most celebrated hotels in Hawaii,” Hapuna Beach, “rated the #1 beach in America by Conde Nast Traveler” and two golf courses – one designed by Arnold Palmer, the other by Robert Trent Jones Sr. “Ohtani will act as the celebrity spokesperson for the project and has committed to purchasing one of the 14 residences within the project,” the brochure says. “He also intends to spend significant time at The Vista in the off-season and will construct a small hitting and pitching facility for preseason training."" The suit says the developers spent 11 years working on the deal and “as part of a bold marketing strategy” signed an endorsement deal in 2023 with Ohtani, “one of the most high-profile endorsements imaginable."" “This partnership with Ohtani will elevate the demand and create buzz within the Japanese luxury vacation home market, which is a primary target audience for the project,"" the investment brochure said. “We see Shohei Ohtani’s homeownership as having a significant impact on the global exposure of the project and expect to accelerate the pace of sales, thereby helping us achieve our pricing objectives.” The suit said Balelo “quickly became a disruptive force,” threatening to pull Ohtani from the deal if concessions weren't made. “Kingsbarn began capitulating to Balelo’s every whim,” the suit said. “Over time, it became increasingly obvious that Kingsbarn was more concerned about preserving its relationship with Otani than honoring its obligations to its business partners.” Last month, in what the suit called “a coordinated ambush,” Kingsbarn fired Hayes and Matsumoto. “Kingsbarn openly admitted during the call that Balelo had demanded the terminations and that they were being done solely to placate him,” the suit said. “Plaintiffs stand to lose millions of dollars in compensation tied to projected homebuilding profit, construction management fees, and broker commissions.” ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

"US and China extend trade truce another 90 days, easing tension between world's largest economies",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/us-and-china-extend-trade-truce-another-90-days-easing-tension-between-worlds-largest-economies-2025-08-11/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump extended a trade truce with China for another 90 days Monday, at least delaying once again a dangerous showdown between the world’s two biggest economies. Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that he signed the executive order for the extension, and that “all other elements of the Agreement will remain the same.” Beijing at the same time also announced the extension of the tariff pause, according to the Ministry of Commerce. The previous deadline was set to expire at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday. Had that happened the U.S. could have ratcheted up taxes on Chinese imports from an already high 30%, and Beijing could have responded by raising retaliatory levies on U.S. exports to China. The pause buys time for the two countries to work out some of their differences, perhaps clearing the way for a summit later this year between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, and it has been welcomed by the U.S. companies doing business with China. Sean Stein, president of the U.S.-China Business Council, said the extension is “critical” to give the two governments time to negotiate a trade agreement that U.S. businesses hope would improve their market access in China and provide the certainty needed for companies to make medium- and long-term plans. “Securing an agreement on fentanyl that leads to a reduction in U.S. tariffs and a rollback of China’s retaliatory measures is acutely needed to restart U.S. agriculture and energy exports,” Stein said. China said Tuesday it would extend relief to American companies who were placed on an export control list and an unreliable entities list. After Trump initially announced tariffs in April, China restricted exports of dual-use goods to some American companies, while banning others from trading or investing in China. The Ministry of Commerce said it would stop those restrictions for some companies, while giving others another 90-day extension. Reaching a pact with China remains unfinished business for Trump, who has already upended the global trading system by slapping double-digit taxes – tariffs – on almost every country on earth. The European Union, Japan and other trading partners agreed to lopsided trade deals with Trump, accepting once unthinkably U.S. high tariffs (15% on Japanese and EU imports, for instance) to ward off something worse. Trump’s trade policies have turned the United States from one of the most open economies in the world into a protectionist fortress. The average U.S. tariff has gone from around 2.5% at the start of the year to 18.6%, highest since 1933, according to the Budget Lab at Yale University. But China tested the limits of a U.S. trade policy built around using tariffs as a cudgel to beat concessions out of trading partners. Beijing had a cudgel of its own: cutting off or slowing access to its rare earths minerals and magnets – used in everything from electric vehicles to jet engines. In June, the two countries reached an agreement to ease tensions. The United States said it would pull back export restrictions on computer chip technology and ethane, a feedstock in petrochemical production. And China agreed to make it easier for U.S. firms to get access to rare earths. “The U.S. has realized it does not have the upper hand,’’ said Claire Reade, senior counsel at Arnold & Porter and former assistant U.S. trade representative for China affairs. In May, the U.S. and China had averted an economic catastrophe by reducing massive tariffs they'd slapped on each other’s products, which had reached as high as 145% against China and 125% against the U.S. Those triple-digit tariffs threatened to effectively end trade between the United States and China and caused a frightening sell-off in financial markets. In a May meeting in Geneva they agreed to back off and keep talking: America’s tariffs went back down to a still-high 30% and China’s to 10%. Having demonstrated their ability to hurt each other, they’ve been talking ever since. “By overestimating the ability of steep tariffs to induce economic concessions from China, the Trump administration has not only underscored the limits of unilateral U.S. leverage, but also given Beijing grounds for believing that it can indefinitely enjoy the upper hand in subsequent talks with Washington by threatening to curtail rare earth exports,'' said Ali Wyne, a specialist in U.S.-China relations at the International Crisis Group. ""The administration’s desire for a trade détente stems from the self-inflicted consequences of its earlier hubris.” It’s unclear whether Washington and Beijing can reach a grand bargain over America’s biggest grievances. Among these are lax Chinese protection of intellectual property rights and Beijing’s subsidies and other industrial policies that, the Americans say, give Chinese firms an unfair advantage in world markets and have contributed to a massive U.S. trade deficit with China of $262 billion last year. Reade doesn’t expect much beyond limited agreements such as the Chinese saying they will buy more American soybeans and promising to do more to stop the flow of chemicals used to make fentanyl and to allow the continued flow of rare-earth magnets. But the tougher issues will likely linger, and “the trade war will continue grinding ahead for years into the future,’’ said Jeff Moon, a former U.S. diplomat and trade official who now runs the China Moon Strategies consultancy. ___ Associated Press Staff Writers Josh Boak and Huizhong Wu contributed to this story.

"Inflation likely moved higher last month as tariffs bite, putting the Fed in bind",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/inflation-likely-moved-higher-last-month-as-tariffs-bite-putting-the-fed-in-bind-2025-08-11/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Inflation likely ticked up in July for the third straight month as tariffs lift the cost of imported goods such as furniture, appliances, and toys, which could make it harder for the Federal Reserve to cut short-term interest rates as President Donald Trump has demanded. Consumer prices are forecast to have risen 2.8% in July from a year earlier, according to a survey of economists by data provider FactSet. That annual pace would be up from 2.7% in June and a post-pandemic low of 2.3% in April. Excluding volatile food and energy costs, core inflation is expected to rise to 3%, from 2.9% in June. Both figures are well above the Fed's 2% price target. The potential increases, while modest, would put the Fed in a difficult spot: Hiring slowed sharply in the spring, after Trump announced a sweeping set of tariffs in April. The stalling out of job gains has boosted financial market expectations for an interest rate cut by the central bank. Yet Fed chair Jerome Powell has warned that worsening inflation could keep the Fed on the sidelines — a stance that has enraged Trump, who has defied traditional norms of central bank independence and demanded lower borrowing costs. Tuesday's data will also arrive at a highly-charged moment for the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, which collects and publishes the inflation data. Trump fired Erika McEntarfer, then the head of BLS, after the Aug. 1 jobs report also showed sharply lower hiring for May and June than had previously been reported. The president posted on social media Monday that he has picked E.J. Antoni, an economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation and a frequent critic of the jobs report, to replace McEntarfer. “E.J. will ensure that the Numbers released are HONEST and ACCURATE,” Trump said on Truth Social. Adding to the BLS's turmoil is a government-wide hiring freeze that has forced it to cut back on the amount of data it collects for each inflation report, the agency has said. UBS economist Alan Detmeister estimates that BLS is now collecting about 18% fewer price quotes for the inflation report than it did a few months ago. He thinks the report will produce more volatile results, though averaged out over time, still reliable. On a monthly basis, prices are expected to rise modestly, increasing just 0.2% from June to July and core prices rising 0.3%. Gas prices likely fell in July and grocery costs are expected to barely increase, muting overall inflation. Signs of duties pushing up prices first emerged in the June inflation report released last month. Toy prices jumped 1.8% from May to June, after a 1.3% increase the previous month. Clothing prices rose 0.4% in June, while sporting goods leapt 1.8%. Meanwhile, the average tariff level has climbed from about 2% before Trump's inauguration to nearly 18%, the highest since the early 1930s, according to the Budget Lab at Yale. Most imports from the European Union and Japan now face duties of 15%, while goods from Taiwan pay 20% and Switzerland, 39%. Other trends are helping keep inflation from rising more quickly. Price increases for apartment rents, for example, are steadily cooling after sharp spikes during the pandemic era. And prices for new cars have declined slightly in recent months, even after Trump slapped 25% duties on autos and auto parts. So far, U.S. and overseas carmakers are paying the tariffs, though economists say they likely will pass them on to consumers soon. Car companies are also paying 50% import taxes on steel and aluminum and 30% on parts from China. Ford has said it paid $800 million in tariffs in the second quarter, while General Motors shouldered $1.1 billion. Stellantis, the world's fourth-largest carmaker and the maker of brands such as Chrysler, Dodge, and Jeep, has said it has paid $350 million in tariffs out of a $1.7 billion expected cost this year. Consumers are likely to absorb more costs beyond the auto industry in the coming months, as Trump has begun to finalize many tariffs. Once businesses know what they will be paying, they are more likely to pass those costs to consumers, economists say. Trump has insisted that overseas manufacturers will pay the tariffs by reducing their prices to offset the duties. Yet the pre-tariff prices of imports haven't fallen much since the levies were put in place. Economists at Goldman Sachs estimate that foreign manufacturers have absorbed just 14% of the duties through June, while 22% has been paid by consumers and 64% by U.S. companies. Based on previous patterns, however — such as Trump's 2018 duties on washing machines — the economists expect that by this fall consumers will bear 67% of the burden, while foreign exporters pay 25% and U.S. companies handle just 8%. Many large firms are still raising prices in response to the tariffs, including apparel makers Ralph Lauren and Under Armour, and eyewear company Warby Parker. Consumer products giant Procter & Gamble, maker of Crest toothpaste, Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper, said late last month that it would lift prices on about a quarter of its products by mid-single-digit percentages. And cosmetics maker e.l.f. Beauty, which makes a majority of its products in China, said on Wednesday that it had raised prices by a dollar on its entire product assortment as of Aug. 1 because of tariff costs, the third price hike in its 21-year history. “We tend to lead and then we will see how many more kind of follow us,” CEO Tarang Amin said on an earnings call Wednesday. Matt Pavich, CEO of Revionics, a company that provides AI tools to large retailers to help them evaluate pricing decisions, says many companies are raising prices selectively to offset tariffs, rather than across the board. “Up until now we haven't seen a massive hit to consumers in retail prices,” Pavich said. “Now, they are going up, we've seen that.” ____ Associated Press Retail Writer Anne D'Innocenzio in New York contributed to this report.

"Trump nominates conservative economist to head agency that compiles jobs, inflation data",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-nominates-conservative-economist-to-head-agency-that-compiles-jobs-inflation-data-2025-08-11/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Monday that he has nominated E.J. Antoni, chief economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation, to head the agency that compiles and publishes the nation's employment and inflation figures. “Our Economy is booming, and E.J. will ensure that the Numbers released are HONEST and ACCURATE,” Trump said on social media late Monday. Antoni, if approved by the Senate, would replace Erika McEntarfer, who was appointed commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics by former President Joe Biden. Trump fired McEntarfer Aug. 1 after the July jobs report showed hiring slowed sharply this spring, with job gains in May and June revised much lower than initially estimated. Trump accused McEntarfer, without evidence, of rigging the jobs data for political reasons. The announcement comes one day before the BLS is scheduled to release the latest inflation data, for July. It is forecast to show that consumer prices rose for the third straight month as tariffs are pushing up the cost of many imported goods. Antoni has criticized the bureau's' collection and publication of the jobs data for years, particularly since the COVID-19 pandemic, after which the agency has frequently revised its initial jobs estimates lower. Many conservatives have argued that this potentially benefited Biden by producing a large initial monthly job gain, only to have it reduced in subsequent months. However, revisions — including downward revisions — are not unusual and occurred during the Trump administration as well. Overall hiring jumped after the pandemic and the unemployment rate stayed low even after the revisions. Antoni called for McEntarfer to be fired after the jobs report was released Aug. 1. Last Monday he wrote on X, “There are better ways to collect, process, and disseminate data — that is the task for the next BLS commissioner, and only consistent delivery of accurate data in a timely manner will rebuild the trust that has been lost over the last several years.” The BLS commissioner is the only political appointee at the agency, which is otherwise staffed by career civil servants. Most previous commissioners have been mild-mannered technocrats. Antoni, however, has been an unabashed partisan in his economic analyses posted on the Heritage website. For example, two months ago, in an analysis of the May jobs report, he wrote, “A deep dive into the report shows any weakness started long before the Trump administration, which is making undeniable progress reprivatizing the economy.” Antoni's nomination quickly attracted an unusual level of criticism. Jason Furman, a top economist in the Obama administration, wrote on X: “I don’t think I have ever publicly criticized any Presidential nominee before. But E.J. Antoni is completely unqualified to be BLS Commissioner. He is an extreme partisan and does not have any relevant expertise.” Kyle Pomeleau, a tax expert for the right-leaning Tax Foundation and the conservative American Enterprise Institute, wrote on X: “There are a lot of competent conservative economists that could do this job. E.J. is not one of them."" ___ Associated Press writer Josh Boak contributed to this report. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

"Business spat between Daryl Hall and John Oates has been resolved in arbitration, attorneys say",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/business-spat-between-daryl-hall-and-john-oates-has-been-resolved-in-arbitration-attorneys-say-2025-08-11/,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Daryl Hall and John Oates have resolved their dispute over a Hall & Oates business partnership through arbitration, reaching a private ending after details of their rift went public in court documents filed in a 2023 lawsuit by Hall against Oates, according to a court filing Monday. In Monday's status report, attorneys for Hall noted the case received a final judgment in arbitration and they filed a proposed order for the judge, Nashville Chancellor Russell Perkins, to dismiss the case. In mid-July, Perkins ordered Hall's attorneys to offer an update in the case, which had last seen a public filing in December 2023. It's unclear when the arbitration process was finalized. And details were not revealed about the arbitration outcome between the duo who made music together for more than a half century, including hits in the 1970s and ’80s such as “Maneater,” “Rich Girl” “Kiss on My List” and “I Can’t Go for That (No Can Do).” Robb Harvey, an attorney for Hall, declined to comment. Representatives for Oates did not immediately respond to The Associated Press’ request for comment. In 2023 filings in the case, Hall accused Oates of blindsiding and betraying him, saying their relationship and his trust in Oates have deteriorated. Oates replied that he was “deeply hurt” that Hall was making “inflammatory, outlandish, and inaccurate statements” about him. The judge had paused the sale of Oates’ stake in Whole Oats Enterprises LLP to Primary Wave IP Investment Management LLC. Whole Oats includes valuable Hall & Oates materials such as trademarks, personal name and likeness rights, record royalty income and website and social media assets, a court declaration says. The dispute went public in November 2023, when Hall filed the lawsuit asking the judge to stop the sale by Oates so private arbitration could begin. Hall gave a scathing account of their relationship in early November 2023 during arbitration, and it was made public later in the month in the lawsuit. It alleges that Oates and his team engaged in the “ultimate partnership betrayal” by pushing to sell his share while telling Hall’s associates that he wanted to maintain his ownership. In his own declaration, Oates expressed disappointment with his longtime partner’s words, saying Hall’s accusations that Oates went behind his back and breached their agreement aren’t true. Oates declined to go into specifics, saying he’s obligated to keep details private, even if Hall didn’t. Last year, Oates told The Associated Press that he's had “no communication” with Hall and declined to discuss the legal proceedings. He did not see a Hall & Oates reunion in his future. “I personally don’t see it happening. It’s not in my plans at all. You can ask Daryl Hall what he thinks. But for me personally, no,” he says. The Times asked Hall in February if the ship had sailed on mending the pair's relationship. “That ship has gone to the bottom of the ocean,” Hall told the news outlet. “I’ve had a lot of surprises in my life, disappointments, betrayals, so I’m kind of used to it.” ___ Maria Sherman in New York contributed to this report.

MNDY Stock Has a Case of the Mondays—Buy Before the Rebound,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/mndy-stock-has-a-case-of-the-mondaysbuy-before-the-rebound/,"Monday.com’s NASDAQ: MNDY August price plunge is not easy for its stockholders to watch, but there is good news. The drop is a knee-jerk reaction to tepid news compounded by relatively high short interest that discounts the company’s long-term outlook. It will likely not last long. Trading at roughly 7x the long-term earnings forecast ahead of the release, the nearly 20% price plunge deepened the value in this well-positioned cash-generating machine. Monday.com is a leader in workflow management and AI-empowered automation. Its technology and services enable organizations to automate workflows, manage projects more efficiently, and streamline operations, and are gaining traction with businesses and industries worldwide. Monday.com reported a solid quarter with only two things marring the results. The first point is that growth is slowing sequentially, and compared to last year, the second is that the Q3 guidance was only as expected. The takeaway for investors is that growth was expected to slow, results were better-than-forecast, and Q3 guidance had been sufficient to sustain the higher share price ahead of the release; there is no reason why it shouldn’t be afterward. The more critical detail is that the Q2 strengths are expected to linger, and the full-year guide was improved. As of early to mid-August, the company's forecast indicates revenue growth of roughly 26%, which is 200 basis points hotter than MarketBeat’s reported consensus. Due to the business trends, this may be considered cautious guidance. The Q2 results are solid. The company outperformed MarketBeat’s reported consensus by more than 100 basis points, growing revenue by nearly 27% compared to last year. The gains were driven by an 8% increase in clients and an 11% increase in existing business, driven by the company’s largest client groups. They grew by 36% and 46% respectively. The margin news is also healthy. The company increased its R&D and faced expense hurdles, but managed to outperform the market’s expectations. The net result is a 100-basis-point contraction in the adjusted operating margin and $1.09 in adjusted EPS, up only 16% year-over-year (YOY) compared to the 26.6% top-line advance, but more than 2500 basis points better than expected and sufficient to produce a significant gain in shareholder value. Monday.com’s balance sheet health and growth are tied to dilutive share sales, but the company deploys capital efficiently and produces value for investors. The 2% YOY increase in share count and increased liability are offset by increased cash, current and total assets, which lifted equity by 18% year-to-date. Equity is expected to continue rising as the year progresses and drive robust support from the sell-side. Institutions, which own about 75% of the stock, provide a solid support base in 2025, and they are buying on balance as of mid-Q3 2025. The analysts, the vocal portion of the group, also provide solid support with their coverage increasing, sentiment firming, and price targets rising ahead of the release, indicating a deep value. Already trading below the low-end of the analysts' range ahead of the release, the post-release price plunge puts the stock well below, suggesting a minimum of 50% upside with the potential for a 75% gain at the consensus. Monday.com’s price decline may extend to even deeper levels, but there are signs that support is strong near $200. Numerous price upswings, including two in 2024 and two in early 2025, not only show support at the $200 level but also rising support aligning with an uptrend. The likely outcome is that, based on the results, valuation, and trends of institutions and analysts, this level will continue to serve as support. The market may consolidate near $200 before rebounding, but a rebound and fresh long-term highs are likely within a few quarters.  Before you consider monday.com, you'll want to hear this.

Increasing the danger: Journalist killing in Gaza sends a chilling message,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/increasing-the-danger-journalist-killing-in-gaza-sends-a-chilling-message-2025-08-11/,"Israel's targeted killing of an Al Jazeera correspondent in Gaza over the weekend was noteworthy even for a conflict remarkably blood-soaked for journalists, leaving some experts to marvel that any news at all emerges from the territory. An Al Jazeera executive said Monday that it won't back down from covering what is going on there and called for news organizations to step up and recruit more journalists. A total of 184 Palestinian journalists and media workers have been killed by Israel in the Gaza war since its start in October 2023, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. That compares to the 18 journalists and media workers killed so far in the Russia-Ukraine war, CPJ said. Aside from rare guided tours, Israel has barred international media from covering the 22-month war in Gaza. News organizations instead rely largely on Palestinian Gaza residents and ingenuity to show the world what is happening there. Israel often questions the affiliations and biases of Palestinian journalists but doesn't permit others in. “You simply are in awe when stories show up,” said Jane Ferguson, a veteran war correspondent and founder of Noosphere, an independent platform for journalists. She can't recall a conflict that has been more difficult for reporters to cover, and she's reported from South Sudan, Syria and Afghanistan. Correspondent Anas al-Sharif knew he was a target, and left behind a message to be delivered upon his death. He and seven other people — six of them journalists — were killed in an air strike outside of Gaza City’s largest hospital complex on Sunday. Israel swiftly claimed responsibility, saying without producing evidence that al-Sharif had led a Hamas cell. It was a claim the news organization and al-Sharif had denied. Agence France-Presse, The Associated Press, BBC News and Reuters are among the organizations regularly reporting from Gaza. An Aug. 7 AP dispatch vividly described the hunger faced by many in Gaza: “A single bowl of eggplant stewed in watery tomato juice must sustain Sally Muzhed's family of six for the day. She calls it moussaka, but it's a pale echo of the fragrant, lawyered, meat-and-vegetable dish that once filled Gaza's kitchens with its aroma.” Other recent AP reports carried images and text reporting from the aftermath of an Israeli strike on Gaza's only Catholic church, and a profile of an 18-year-old aspiring doctor now trying to survive sheltered in a tent. Journalists from The Washington Post and the Guardian recently accompanied a Jordanian relief mission and took images of Gaza from the air, despite some restrictions from Israel. The Guardian's Lorenzo Tondo wrote: “Seen from the air, Gaza looks like the ruins of an ancient civilization, brought to light after centuries of darkness.” None of the organizations match the power and immediacy of Al Jazeera, however, in part because their correspondents have been in front of cameras. They've also paid the heaviest price: CPJ estimates that 11 journalists and media workers affiliated with AJ have been killed in the Gaza conflict, more than any other single organization. In a social media post written in June to be sent if he was killed, al-Sharif wrote that “I have lived through pain in all its details, tasted suffering and loss many times, yet I never once hesitated to convey the truth as it is, without distortion or falsification — so that Allah may bear witness against those who stayed silent.” In another posting on X on Aug. 10, the day that he was killed, al-Sharif wrote of the challenges covering the aftermath of one attack. He said he lost his strength and ability to express himself when he arrived at the scene. “Body parts and blood were all around us, and corpses were scattered on top of each other,” he wrote. “Tell me what words and phrases could help any journalist describe this horrific image. When I told you on air that it was an ‘indescribable scene,' I was truly helpless in the face of this horrific sight.” Salah Negm, news director at Al Jazeera English, said Monday it is very difficult to get people in to Gaza. But it is full of educated people and those with training in journalism who can help get stories out. He called on other news organizations to step up. “We get the news from several sources on the ground in Gaza — not only journalists but also doctors, hospitals, civil servants, aid workers,” Negm said. “A lot of people in Gaza talk to us.” Many of the journalists working in Gaza are facing the same struggles to find food, for themselves and their families, as the people they are covering. Noosphere's Ferguson said she's never before had to ask a reporter whether she had enough food for herself and her child. In an interview in May on “Democracy Now!,” 22-year-old journalist Abubaker Abed described the difficult decision he made to leave Gaza to pursue his education in Ireland. Not only was he suffering from malnutrition, he said, but his mother was concerned that his work as a journalist would make him and his family targets. “If I stayed, I would die,” he said. Jodie Ginsberg, CEO of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said she's concerned about the implications for journalists in future conflicts if what is happening in Gaza is allowed to continue without international condemnation that has real teeth. “They're essentially admitting in public to what amounts to a war crime,” Ginsberg said, “and they can do that because none of the other attacks on journalists have had any consequences. not in this war and not prior. It's not surprising that it can act with this level of impunity because no international government has really taken it to task.” Given all that they face, “to me, the most remarkable thing is that journalists are continuing to cover (Gaza) at all,” she said. ___ Laurie Kellman and Danica Kirk in London, Samy Magdy in Cairo and Sam Metz in Jerusalem contributed to this report.

IPO Market Stays Hot With These 2 Debuting Stocks,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/ipo-market-stays-hot-with-these-2-debuting-stocks/,"It’s a hot IPO summer as new listings make their long-awaited return to public markets. After a cool first half of 2025, the demand for Initial Public Offerings has exploded in Q3, with anticipated companies like Circle Internet Group Inc. NYSE: CRCL and CoreWeave Inc. NASDAQ: CRWV surpassing even the rosiest expectations upon their debut. And it doesn’t appear that momentum is slowing as several more promising companies are unveiling their listings. A range of factors has kept the IPO market subdued recently. Not only was the macro-environment poor in the first half of 2025 due to erratic trade policies, but private companies have been staying private longer than historical norms. According to research from Morgan Stanley, companies are now staying private for nearly 11 years on average before going public, a significant increase over the seven-year average from 2014. Private companies aren’t scrutinized as closely as their publicly traded counterparts, and high rates have clogged the capital spigot over the last few years. Couple these factors with the rise of private markets, and there simply isn’t the enthusiasm for ‘going public’ as there was in the past. Only 84 IPOs were issued in the first half of 2025, down from over 100 in the same period last year. If there’s light at the end of the tunnel, it began shining earlier this summer. We’ve seen several new listings hit the market, and many have grown exponentially in the first day or week of trading. Three reasons for the turnaround include: The first wave of big IPOs this year saw companies like CoreWeave and Circle achieve impressive gains before volatility muted the fun. But July was another banner month for new issues; here are two debuting stocks to keep on your radar. The biggest IPO debut since CoreWeave, Figma Inc. NYSE: FIG, got off to an absurd start even before shares went public. After initially looking at an opening price between $25 - $28, the stock debuted at $33 and quickly rose toward $100 before hitting the exchanges. By the end of the first day, FIG shares were trading at $115, a shocking gain of more than 200% from the opening price. Figma has the financial data to back up its exciting first-week performance. The company has more than 13 million active users and earned more than $228 million in revenue in Q1 2025 (a 46% year-over-year (YOY) increase), with a net income of $44.9 million. FIG’s market cap surged over $67 billion after the first day of trading, although a 35% pullback sent shares back under $80 in the subsequent five sessions. Figma’s unique platform allows designers and professionals to collaborate on different interfaces in real-time, and with 85% of current customers outside the United States, the growth prospects remain strong despite the hefty valuation at about 40x sales. Figma’s impressive list of corporate clients includes Stripe, Duolingo, and Netflix Inc. NASDAQ: NFLX. If you don’t mind seeing Ryan Reynolds in the C-suite and have an interest in innovative AI-based advertising companies, MNTN Inc. NYSE: MNTN could be an intriguing investment. Pronounced ‘Mountain,’ the company has a platform called Performance TV, which helps clients create specific, tailored advertising plans targeting viewers based on their Connected TV watching habits and demographics. Connected TV is simply any TV with an internet connection, such as a Roku TV or Amazon Fire TV Stick. MNTN reported its first earnings release as a public company on August 5, which missed analysts’ expectations on EPS but surpassed revenue estimates by 6%. The $68.46 million in revenue represented a 25% YOY increase, and the company has a distinct first-mover advantage in this space thanks to partnerships with Peacock, ESPN, CBS, and Fox. MarketBeat is already tracking 10 analysts covering the stock, with two Hold ratings and eight Buy ratings. The consensus price target is $29.90, which suggests upside of nearly 20% from current prices. Before you consider Figma, you'll want to hear this.

"Taiwan Semiconductor Stock: Own It, Don't Trade It",https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/taiwan-semiconductor-stock-own-it-dont-trade-it/,"One of the biggest mistakes investors can make is constantly trading in and out of the wrong stocks, triggering one taxable event after another on their gains. While some smaller, more volatile stocks may lend themselves to short-term trading, others call for the opposite approach—a steady buy-and-hold strategy. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing NYSE: TSM fits squarely into that second category. As a dominant force in the semiconductor industry, it holds a massive footprint in one of technology’s hottest areas. The sector is on the verge of major change as the United States moves to onshore chip manufacturing, especially with new trade tariffs targeting countries that supply much of the world’s semiconductors. With this in mind, Taiwan Semiconductor is a stock best suited for long-term accumulation—buying gradually and holding for an indefinite period. The reason goes beyond the company’s staggering $1 trillion market value. It also lies in the major investments and expansion into the United States that are set to unfold in the coming years. There has never been an invalid bull case for this company. Still, today more than ever, investors should stay alert to the underlying issues that could push this stock to new record highs. Even though it already trades at 97% of its 52-week high, chances are new ceilings will be made in the coming quarters and years, despite what volatility may come its way. The reason is that President Trump is now increasing tariffs on semiconductors, and as recently announced on a live CNBC interview, his rollout points to a high of 200% tariffs by 2027, giving companies like Taiwan Semiconductors a concrete timeline to get their manufacturing capacity within the United States. This means investors can get in early on this massive move, as onshoring its presence will also allow Taiwan Semiconductor to remain one of the leading names in semiconductor equipment and technology, most of which is used by other giants of industry like NVIDIA Co. NASDAQ: NVDA and Apple Inc. NASDAQ: AAPL. With a few years of gains nearly spelled out for investors, selling at the current highs would be futile, since they would only have to keep buying higher and higher, again stacking up more tax events for themselves unnecessarily. In fact, anyone who sells this stock today is most likely doing it for portfolio weighing reasons. For instance, institutional investors from Sanders Capital recently offloaded 7.8% of their massive $8.7 billion position in Taiwan Semiconductor. This should not be seen as a bearish sign, considering that this stock represents 11.6% of their portfolio, a recent run to 52-week highs likely bloated the stock to become too big a name in their book. This is a common practice at investment funds, where they reduce a name’s weight in a portfolio to avoid it becoming too big a constituent, thereby not necessarily indicating a change in sentiment or view toward the company. This is a more abstract question that can be answered in the same way as it is traditionally responded to by investment banks on Wall Street. Taiwan Semiconductor stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 27.6x today, but it still offers a steep discount to the rest of the computer sector’s average of 50.3x. Perhaps some investors and analysts had discounted this stock due to fears that it was so exposed to the Asian region, where most trade tariffs seem to be focused. However, changing the game plan to onshoring in the United States renders this bearish view useless. That change alone could be the catalyst to bring Taiwan Semiconductor stock to a valuation more in line with where the rest of its peers are trading today in terms of P/E multiples. More than that, the fundamental story is strong enough today to make this happen. In the latest quarterly announcement, Taiwan Semiconductor's stock reported $2.47 in earnings per share (EPS) compared to the Wall Street consensus for only $2.13, reiterating the fact that even analysts may be looking at this company through an overly conservative lens. As compliance with global tariffs and changes in demographics clear the way for future growth, further EPS beats in the future may very well start to deliver the sort of upside Taiwan Semiconductor has been missing out on compared to peers. Therefore, trading this stock would be a costly mistake for impatient investors; this is a buy-and-hold name. Before you consider Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, you'll want to hear this.

AOL is finally shutting down its dial-up internet service,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/aol-is-finally-shutting-down-its-dial-up-internet-service-2025-08-11/,"NEW YORK (AP) — AOL's dial-up internet is finally taking its last bow. Yes, while perhaps a dinosaur by today's digital standards, dial-up is still around. But AOL says it's officially pulling the plug for its service on Sept. 30. ""AOL routinely evaluates its products and services and has decided to discontinue Dial-up Internet,"" AOL wrote in a brief update on its support site — noting that dial-up and associated software “optimized for older operating systems"" will soon be unavailable on AOL plans. AOL, formerly America Online, introduced many households to the world wide web for the first time when its dial-up service launched decades ago, rising to prominence particularly in the 90s and early 2000s. The creaky door to the internet was characterized by a once-ubiquitous series of beeps and buzzes heard over the phone used to connect your computer online — along with frustrations of being kicked off the web if anyone else at home needed the landline for another call, and an endless bombardment of CDs mailed out by AOL to advertise free trials. Eventually, broadband and wireless offerings emerged and rose to dominance, doing away with dial-up's quirks for most people accessing the internet today. Still, a handful of consumers have continued to rely on internet services connected over telephone lines. In the U.S., according to Census Bureau data, an estimated 163,401 households were using dial-up alone to get online in 2023, representing just over 0.13% of all homes with internet subscriptions nationwide. AOL was the largest dial-up internet provider for some time, but not the only one to emerge over the years. Some smaller internet providers continue to offer dial-up today. Regardless, the decline of dial-up has been a long time coming. And AOL shutting down its service arrives as other relics of the internet's earlier days continue to disappear. Microsoft retired video calling service Skype just earlier this year, for example — as well as Internet Explorer back in 2022. And in 2017, AOL discontinued its Instant Messenger — a chat platform that was once lauded as the biggest trend in online communication since email when it was founded in 1997, but later struggled to ward off rivals. AOL itself is far from the dominant internet player it was decades ago — when, beyond dial-up and IMs, the company also became known for its “You’ve got mail” catchphrase that greeted users who checked their inboxes, as famously displayed in the 1998 film starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan by the same name. Before it was America Online, AOL was founded as Quantum Computer Services in 1985. It soon rebranded and hit the public market in 1991. Near the height of the dot-com boom, AOL's market value reached nearly $164 billion in 2000. But tumultuous years followed, and that valuation plummeted as the once-tech pioneer bounced between multiple owners. After a disastrous merger with Time Warner Inc., Verizon acquired AOL — which later sold AOL, along with Yahoo, to a private equity firm. At the time Verzion announced that sale to in 2021, an anonymous source familiar with the transaction told CNBC that the number of AOL dial-up users was “in the low thousands,"" down from 2.1 million when Verzion first moved to acquire AOL in 2015 — and far below peak demand seen back in the 90s and early 2000s. But beyond dial-up, AOL continues to offer its free email services, as well as subscriptions that advertise identity protection and other tech support.

4 Stocks That May Get a Big Earnings Bump This Week,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/4-stocks-that-may-get-a-big-earnings-bump-this-week/,"As Amazon.com Inc. NASDAQ: AMZN reminds us, sometimes it can be difficult to predict how the market will respond to a company's earnings report, even if the firm comes out ahead of analyst expectations for earnings and revenue. Amazon's dip following its latest report, despite top- and bottom-line beats, shows that sometimes details like forward guidance or the suggestion of short-term difficulties can be enough to undo any investor goodwill that may have built. With that in mind, it's impossible to predict how the four companies below will fare as they report earnings the week of August 11. However, each of them stands out from its industry peers for its strong support from analysts and enjoys other potential selling points. We'll take a closer look for anyone considering a purchase before earnings results come in. Applied Materials Inc. NASDAQ: AMAT provides technologies essential to the manufacturing of chips, DRAM, and NAND memory, making it a key player in the AI/data center niche. However, the company's addressable market goes well beyond that space, and Applied Materials may play a hand in the construction of everything from personal computers and smartphones to cloud servers, among many other things. The chip foundry market is expected to grow rapidly in the coming years, which should keep demand for Applied Materials' Etch and eBeam products and technology high. The company also recently announced a partnership with Apple Inc. NASDAQ: AAPL and Texas Instruments Inc. NASDAQ: TXN to supply American-made manufacturing equipment. Thus, the firm is poised to benefit from a regulatory landscape strongly favoring domestic chip production. While these last points will not factor into Applied Materials' most recent earnings quarter, analysts are optimistic and expect earnings to grow by 7.4% this year. Seventeen out of 25 analysts have rated AMAT shares a Buy, and the stock could have more than 10% in near-term upside potential based on price targets. Packaging products giant Amcor plc NYSE: AMCR is likely to get a boost in its earnings report this week, the company's fiscal fourth-quarter report, thanks to its all-stock combination with packaging rival Berry Global. The deal, valued at over $8 billion, was completed by the end of April 2025, within the latest quarter. Amcor has said the acquisition should provide 12% earnings per share (EPS) accretion in fiscal 2026 and at least 35% in EPS accretion by the end of fiscal 2028. It's difficult to say exactly how much of this impact may be felt so early on, but signs of success in this area could excite investors, giving AMCR shares a boost. Particularly if the company can maintain its strong cash flow and attractive valuation, shares could get a bump. This may be why eight out of 10 analysts view AMCR shares as a Buy. Based on analyst price targets, the company also has more than 19% upside potential. Singaporean internet and mobile platform firm Sea Ltd. NYSE: SE has made significant inroads into the digital financial services space. This should help the company continue to dominate in the Southeast Asian region, where it already has a considerable market share for its e-commerce platform. On the other hand, short interest has risen by about 2.5% in the last month, perhaps owing to the company's high valuation, which currently trades at a P/E ratio of more than 104. However, that lofty valuation is not a concern for most analysts. Ten out of 13 view it as a Buy, and a consensus price target of $159.82 suggests the stock still has room to climb about 8.2% in the near term. Perhaps even more interesting for investors watching the company's upcoming earnings report is the analyst conviction that Sea's earnings could quadruple in the coming year to $2.96 per share. Credit-tech platform 360 Jietiao is backed by Qifu Technology Inc. NASDAQ: QFIN, though the parent company is in the midst of a rebranding and name change. Nonetheless, Qifu gives investors many reasons to consider it despite being an overlooked name in the Chinese market. Recent earnings successes, significant partnerships with multiple municipal banks in China, and big gains in loan facilitation and origination volume should all drive interest. Analysts expect earnings to grow by nearly 12% in the coming year. QFIN shares are only rated by three analysts in the United States, but each has assigned a Buy rating.

Why SoundHound AI's Earnings Show the Stock Can Move Higher,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/why-soundhound-ais-earnings-show-the-stock-can-move-higher/,"One of the most important questions investors need to ask during and after an earnings announcement for a stock is whether growth has been priced in or not. Typically, the days after a stock moves on earnings are when broader market participants attempt to land on a fair price that reflects the important information they’ve just received, and that is where some will fall off the track. Others will stick to the right narrative for further gains. That question is being asked for shares of SoundHound AI Inc. NASDAQ: SOUN after the stock rallied by over 26% in a single day after reporting its latest quarterly earnings results. Not only is this a critical time to be aware of what comes next, but this one is particularly tricky, considering the company has yet to achieve net profitability per share, sending some investors into a cloud of doubt. Today, some of those doubts will be removed as investors hone in on the numbers that really matter and explain why the macro backdrop stands to help SoundHound’s services and technology into another wave of expansion for the coming quarters. When it comes to the technology sector, this stock is as good as any other despite not having net profitability. Here’s why that is. For this $5.4 billion company, a 26% rally takes more than just a good quarter and justified attention from the market overall. As most investors are focused on the semiconductor and chipmaking areas of this artificial intelligence race, such a move implies that sentiment and attention might be shifting into other areas. However, SoundHound's bull case comes from a much broader thesis. As President Trump changes migration policies in the United States, industries like retail and service-based companies see some of their workforce demographics change. The remaining ones are now overloaded with more work to compensate for the gap. In recent employment reports, it is no surprise that many workers are asking for higher wages. If businesses agree to these increases, they face two options: pass the added costs on to consumers, which could fuel inflation, or invest in technology to improve efficiency. This is why SoundHound’s earnings show that the company’s services are contracted across several restaurant brands. Red Lobster, Applebee’s, IHOP, and others have sought to add SoundHound’s artificial intelligence capabilities to expedite their service process, efficiently reducing some costs to accommodate potential higher wages. And that’s not all. SoundHound has been a successful case study in other industries, such as healthcare, retail, financial services, and even automotive. Even Chinese car manufacturers have contracted SoundHound’s software to be integrated into their vehicles, a massive growth market for the company’s future. With all these tailwinds in mind, investors shouldn’t be surprised to see the company’s net revenue grow to $42.7 million this quarter, a massive 217% increase from the same quarter last year, a record in the company’s history. Even after this 26% rally and critical footprint expansion, SoundHound stock still trades at a dismal 54% of its 52-week high, meaning investors can still enjoy a discounted opportunity to be exposed to this further growth down the line. Moreover, enough bears are out there to trigger a jet-fueled rally higher. Considering that short positions in SoundHound stock now amount to $1.4 billion, or 33.7% of the total float, another rally like the one investors just witnessed could trigger what’s known as a short squeeze. This is an event where short sellers are forced to close their positions at a loss, which involves buying back the stock. This additional buying pressure, worth up to $1.4 billion, would be a massive boost in terms of demand for the stock, and it will be translated into higher prices if this happens. Now, for the other side of the equation, the recent earnings did trigger new institutional buying interest for this company. Those from Geode Capital Management justified boosting their holdings in SoundHound stock by 8.3% as of the day of the earnings release, bringing their entire position to a high of $94.8 million or 2.2% ownership in the whole company. This is not something investors should take lightly. Institutions often stay away from companies this small, so when they decide to move into them, chances are they are expecting a higher long-term run backed by fundamentals, as investors can verify today for SoundHound. With this much financial momentum, it’s a matter of time before this stock reports net profitability and retests old 52-week highs of just under $25 per share.

"Post-Earnings, How Does D-Wave Stack Up Against Quantum Rivals?",https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/post-earnings-how-does-d-wave-stack-up-against-quantum-rivals/,"Rising quantum computing star D-Wave Quantum Inc. NYSE: QBTS posted mixed earnings results in early August 2025, as revenue growth surpassed analyst predictions but losses came in wider than expected. Though not the unqualified positive signal some bullish investors were likely hoping for, D-Wave's earnings did not dent the short-term stock performance; shares remain up almost 20% in the last month. Given the emerging nature of the industry, each new earnings cycle drives new speculation among investors about which quantum firm or firms may be best positioned to take the lead. Investors are likely wondering how D-Wave stacks up against competitors like IonQ Inc. NYSE: IONQ and Quantum Computing Inc. NASDAQ: QUBT in light of the latest financial information. With a 42% year-over-year (YOY) surge in revenue and bookings nearly doubling to $1.3 million over the same period, D-Wave may have eased concerns about marketability in this latest earnings round. With its Advantage2 system now generally available, the company is looking forward to additional sales, as well as a series of upgrades of earlier systems already operational for multiple customers. Additionally, D-Wave's marketability proposition is further strengthened by the company's announcements surrounding major partnerships with an unnamed large aerospace and defense firm as well as law enforcement in North Wales. The more use cases of D-Wave's technology that emerge, the more likely it seems that the company will be able to draw additional interest across industries. Finally, D-Wave's advantageous cash position remains a boon. The company ended the quarter with an incredible $819 in cash reserves, positioning it well to continue to advance its technological developments—such as cryogenic packaging, which could be key to unlocking advances in gate-model tech, so far a gap for the firm—and to put forward an M&A strategy. Among D-Wave's competitors, one of the most direct comparisons is IonQ, which also reported second-quarter earnings in the same week. This rival is more than double the size of D-Wave by market cap, and its revenue is quite a bit higher as well. What's more, IonQ revenue increased YOY at roughly double the pace of D-Wave's—81.6% for IonQ compared to 40.9% for D-Wave. This brought IonQ to a tidy $3.5 million revenue surprise and a total of $20.7 million in revenue for the quarter, driven by new and expanding business in Japan, South Korea, and elsewhere. IonQ's growing global footprint should concern D-Wave investors, although the latter firm is also making aggressive moves to establish an international presence. However, IonQ shares D-Wave's profitability woes: losses per share of 70 cents widened significantly YOY and missed expectations by an eye-opening 57 cents. Investors did not react negatively to this news, though, and IonQ shares remain up more than 9% in the last month. Perhaps one reason for this is that the widening losses are mostly attributable to operating expenses which tripled YOY as the firm boosted its R&D spending by 231%. Spending heavily to advance technology may be a worthwhile trade-off, even if it means bigger losses in the short term. Finally, IonQ is gaining attention from major tech firms, an update that could boost the company's prospects significantly. Amazon.com Inc. NASDAQ: AMZN recently bought an equity stake in IonQ worth about $37 million. Though not a huge purchase, it could signal the e-commerce giant's interest in partnering with IonQ on a range of services going forward. Additionally, IonQ's hardware is available through Microsoft's Azure cloud computing platform, despite the fact that the larger firm is also building its own quantum tech. All of these could give IonQ a critical leg up on D-Wave. Firms like Quantum Computing report earnings on a different schedule—this firm is slated to report its second-quarter fiscal 2025 results in early October. Still, there are some noteworthy aspects of Quantum Computing's recent activity to keep in mind, and these warrant investor attention when it does post earnings updates as well. Quantum Computing posted positive earnings of 13 cents per share in its last report, although revenue was weak and below analyst predictions. The company's new foundry in Arizona is now operational, though, and that should accelerate revenue growth in future quarters, particularly into 2026. Quantum Computing also has made significant moves to increase its presence through partnerships with Sloan Kettering, NASA, Delft University of Technology, and others. Despite its smaller size compared to D-Wave and IonQ, it is a worthy rival in the race toward quantum dominance. Before you consider D-Wave Quantum, you'll want to hear this.

"Prince Harry, Meghan and Netflix extend partnership for streaming programs",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/prince-harry-meghan-and-netflix-extend-partnership-for-streaming-programs-2025-08-11/,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Prince Harry and Meghan have extended their partnership with Netflix and their media company, Archewell Productions, with a multiyear, first-look deal, the couple announced Monday. Archewell began collaborating with the streaming giant in 2020 and have produced a handful of documentary content, including the popular “Harry & Meghan.” The Duchess of Sussex also developed a lifestyle brand, As Ever, in partnership with Netflix. The collaboration has also produced the documentary series' “Polo,” “Heart of Invictus” and “Live to Lead.” “My husband and I feel inspired by our partners who work closely with us and our Archewell Productions team to create thoughtful content across genres that resonates globally, and celebrates our shared vision,” Meghan said in a statement. The couple and Netflix also announced upcoming collaborations, including a second season of, “With Love, Meghan,” a lifestyle and cooking show starring the duchess. The show will also receive a special holiday episode in December. The show is Netflix's most-watched culinary show since its March release, according to the company. It ranked low compared to other releases in the first half of this year, with 5.3 million views, according to Netflix's semiannual report. “Masaka Kids, A Rhythm Within,” a documentary short film that centers on a small orphanage in Uganda’s Masaka region, is also set to release this year. Archewell is also in production with Netflix on a feature adaptation of Carley Fortune's novel “Meet Me at the Lake.” The drama “follows a decade-spanning love story that begins with a chance encounter and a broken promise,” the statement read. “Harry and Meghan are influential voices whose stories resonate with audiences everywhere. The response to their work speaks for itself,” Bela Bajaria, Netflix’s chief content officer, said in a statement. Their extended deal with Netflix is the latest in the couple's yearslong effort to develop business ventures in the United States. They had also penned a multiyear deal with Spotify in 2020 and produced a podcast, “ Archetypes, ” but cut ties with the company in 2023. The couple have been detangling their lives from the British royal family and are living in California with their two young children. Before you consider Netflix, you'll want to hear this.
