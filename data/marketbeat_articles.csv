All major Las Vegas Strip casinos are now unionized in historic labor victory,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/all-major-las-vegas-strip-casinos-are-now-unionized-in-historic-labor-victory-2025-08-03/,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — When Susana Pacheco accepted a housekeeping job at a casino on the Las Vegas Strip 16 years ago, she believed it was a step toward stability for her and her 2-year-old daughter. But the single mom found herself exhausted, falling behind on bills and without access to stable health insurance, caught in a cycle of low pay and little support. For years, she said, there was no safety net in sight — until now. For 25 years, her employer, the Venetian, had resisted organizing efforts as one of the last holdouts on the Strip, locked in a prolonged standoff with the Culinary Workers Union. But a recent change in ownership opened the Venetian’s doors to union representation just as the Strip’s newest casino, the Fontainebleau, was also inking its first labor contract. The historic deals finalized late last year mark a major turning point: For the first time in the Culinary Union's 90-year history, all major casinos on the Strip are unionized. Backed by 60,000 members, most of them in Las Vegas, it is the largest labor union in Nevada. Experts say the Culinary Union’s success is a notable exception in a national landscape where union membership overall is declining. “Together, we’ve shown that change can be a positive force, and I’m confident that this partnership will continue to benefit us all in the years to come,"" Patrick Nichols, president and CEO of the Venetian, said shortly after workers approved the deal. Pacheco says their new contract has already reshaped her day-to-day life. The housekeeper no longer races against the clock to clean an unmanageable number of hotel suites, and she’s spending more quality time with her children because of the better pay and guaranteed days off. “Now with the union, we have a voice,” Pacheco said. These gains come at a time when union membership nationally is at an all-time low, and despite Republican-led efforts over the years to curb union power. About 10% of U.S. workers belonged to a union in 2024, down from 20% in 1983, the first year for which data is available, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics. President Donald Trump in March signed an executive order seeking to end collective bargaining for certain federal employees that led to union leaders suing the administration. Nevada and more than two dozen other states now have so-called “right to work” laws that let workers opt out of union membership and dues. GOP lawmakers have also supported changes to the National Labor Relations Board and other regulatory bodies, seeking to reduce what they view as overly burdensome rules on businesses. Ruben Garcia, professor and director of the workplace program at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas law school, said the Culinary Union's resilience stems from its deep roots in Las Vegas, its ability to adapt to the growth and corporatization of the casino industry, and its long history of navigating complex power dynamics with casino owners and operators. He said the consolidation of casinos on the Las Vegas Strip mirrors the dominance of the Big Three automakers in Detroit. A few powerful companies — MGM Resorts International, Caesars Entertainment and Wynn Resorts — now control most of the dozens of casinos along Las Vegas Boulevard. “That consolidation can make things harder for workers in some ways, but it also gives unions one large target,"" Garcia said. That dynamic worked in the union's favor in 2023, when the threat of a major strike by 35,000 hospitality workers with expired contracts loomed over the Strip. But a last-minute deal with Caesars narrowly averted the walkout, and it triggered a domino effect across the Strip, with the union quickly finalizing similar deals for workers at MGM Resorts and Wynn properties. The latest contracts secured a historic 32% bump in pay over the life of the five-year contract. Union casino workers will earn an average $35 hourly, including benefits, by the end of it. The union's influence also extends far beyond the casino floor. With its ability to mobilize thousands of its members for canvassing and voter outreach, the union's endorsements are highly coveted, particularly among Democrats, and can signal who has the best shot at winning working-class votes. The union's path hasn't always been smooth though. Michael Green, a history professor at UNLV, noted the Culinary Union has long faced resistance. “Historically, there have always been people who are anti-union,” Green said. Earlier this year, two food service workers in Las Vegas filed federal complaints with the National Labor Relations Board, accusing the union of deducting dues despite their objections to union membership. It varies at each casino, but between 95 to 98% of workers opt in to union membership, according to the union. “I don’t think Culinary Union bosses deserve my support,” said one of the workers, Renee Guerrero, who works at T-Mobile Arena on the Strip. “Their actions since I attempted to exercise my right to stop dues payments only confirms my decision.” But longtime union members like Paul Anthony see things differently. Anthony, a food server at the Bellagio and a Culinary member for nearly 40 years, said his union benefits — free family health insurance, reliable pay raises, job security and a pension — helped him to build a lasting career in the hospitality industry. “A lot of times it is an industry that doesn't have longevity,"" he said. But on the Strip, it's a job that people can do for “20 years, 30 years, 40 years.” Ted Pappageorge, the union's secretary-treasurer and lead negotiator, said the union calls this the “Las Vegas dream.” “It’s always been our goal to make sure that this town is a union town,"" he said.

"Vietnam automaker Vinfast opens factory in India, eyeing growth in Asia",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/vietnam-automaker-vinfast-to-build-factory-in-india-eyeing-growth-in-asia-2025-08-03/,"THOOTHUKUDI, India (AP) — Vietnam’s Vinfast on Monday began production at a $500 million electric vehicle plant in southern India’s Tamil Nadu state, part of a planned $2 billion investment in India and a broader expansion across Asia. The factory in Thoothukudi will initially make 50,000 electric vehicles annually, with room to triple output to 150,000 cars. Given its proximity to a major port in one of India's most industrialized states, Vinfast hopes it will be a hub for future exports to the region. It says the factory will create more than 3,000 local jobs. The Vietnamese company says it scouted 15 locations across six Indian states before choosing Tamil Nadu. It's the center of India’s auto industry, with strong manufacturing, skilled workers, good infrastructure, and a reliable supply chain, according to Tamil Nadu’s Industries Minister T.R.B. Raaja. “This investment will lead to an entirely new industrial cluster in south Tamil Nadu, and more clusters is what India needs to emerge as a global manufacturing hub,” he said. Vinfast's foray into India reflects a broader shift in strategy. The company increasingly is focusing on Asian markets after struggling to gain traction in the U.S. and Europe. It broke ground last year on a $200 million EV assembly plant in Indonesia, where it plans to make 50,000 cars annually. It's also expanding in Thailand and the Philippines. Vinfast sold nearly 97,000 vehicles in 2024. That's triple what it sold the year before, but only about 10% of those sales were outside Vietnam. As it eyes markets in Asia, it hopes the factory in India will be a base for exports to South Asian countries like Nepal and Sri Lanka and also to countries in the Middle East and Africa. India is the world’s third-largest car market by number of vehicles sold. It presents an enticing mix: A fast growing economy, rising adoption of EVs, supportive government policies and a rare market where players have yet to completely dominate EV sales. “It is a market that no automaker in the world can ignore,” said Ishan Raghav, managing editor of the Indian car magazine autoX. . EV growth in India has been led by two and three-wheelers that accounted for 86% of the over six million EVs sold last year. Sales of four wheel passenger EVs made up only 2.5% of all car sales in India last year, but they have been surging, jumping to more than 110,000 in 2024 from just 1,841 in 2019. The government aims to have EVs account for a third of all passenger vehicle sales by 2030. “The electric car story has started (in India) only three or four years ago,” said Charith Konda, an energy specialist who looks at India’s transport and clean energy sectors for the think-tank Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis or IEEFA. New cars that “look great on the road,” with better batteries, quick charging and longer driving ranges are driving the sector's rapid growth, he said. The shift to EVs is mostly powered by Indian automakers, but Vinfast plans to break into the market later this year with its VF6 and VF7 SUV models, which are designed for India.. Chinese EV brands that dominate in countries like Thailand and Brazil have found India more challenging. After border clashes with China in 2020, India blocked companies like BYD from building their own factories. Some then turned to partnerships. China's SAIC, owner of MG Motor, has joined with India’s JSW Group. Their MG Windsor, a five-seater, sold 30,000 units in just nine months, nibbling Tata Motors’ 70% EV market share down to about 50%. Tata was the first local automaker to court mass-market consumers with EVs. Its 2020 launch of the electric Nexon, a small SUV, became India’s first major EV car success. Vinfast lacks the geopolitical baggage of its larger Chinese rivals and will also benefit from incentives like lower land prices and tax breaks for building locally in India. That's part of India's policy of discouraging imports with high import duties to help encourage local manufacturing and create more jobs. The push for onshore manufacturing is a concern also for Tesla, which launched its Model Y in India last month at a price of nearly $80,000, compared to about $44,990 in the U.S without a federal tax credit. “India’s stand is very clear. We do not want to import manufactured cars, even Teslas. Whether it's Tesla or Chinese cars, they are taxed heavily,” added Konda. The road ahead remains daunting. India’s EV market is crowded with well-entrenched players like Tata Motors and Mahindra, which dominate the more affordable segment, while Hyundai, MG Motors and luxury brands like Mercedes-Benz and Audi compete at high price points. Indians tend to purchase EVs as second cars used for driving within the city, since the infrastructure for charging elsewhere can be undependable. Vinfast will need to win over India's cost-sensitive and conservative drivers with a reputation for quality batteries and services while keeping prices low, said Vivek Gulia, co-founder of JMK Research. “Initially, people will be apprehensive,” he said. Vinfast says it plans to set up showrooms and service centers across India, working with local companies for charging and repairs, and cutting costs by recycling batteries and making key parts like powertrains and battery packs in the country. Scale will be key. VinFast has signed agreements to establish 32 dealerships across 27 Indian cities. Hyundai has 1,300 places for Indians to buy their cars. Building a brand in India takes time — Hyundai, for instance, pulled it off over decades, helped by an early endorsement from Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan. VinFast can succeed if it can get its pricing right and earn the trust of customers, Gulia said, “Then they can actually do really good.” ___ An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Vinfast broke ground on the factory on Monday, rather than beginning production. ___ Sibi Arasu contributed from Bengaluru and Aniruddha Ghosal contributed from Hanoi, Vietnam. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Asian markets are mixed after Wall St tumbles following poor US jobs report,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/asian-markets-are-mixed-after-wall-st-tumbles-following-poor-us-jobs-report-2025-08-03/,"BANGKOK (AP) — Shares in Asia are mixed after Wall Street had its worst day since May following the release of weak U.S. jobs data. Markets in Asia had already reacted on Friday to U.S. President Donald Trump’s announcement of sweeping tariffs on imports from many U.S. trading partners, posting moderate losses. The new import duties are set to take effect on Thursday. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index lost 1.6%, bouncing back from bigger losses, to 40,134.97. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong edged 0.2% higher, to 24,589.21, while the Shanghai Composite index was nearly unchanged at 3,562.18. In South Korea, the Kospi surged 0.7% to 3,140.92. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 shed 0.2% to 8,643.00. Investors' worries about a weakening U.S. economy deepened after the latest report on job growth in the U.S. showed employers added just 73,000 jobs in July. That is sharply lower than economists expected. The Labor Department also reported that revisions shaved a stunning 258,000 jobs off May and June payrolls. “The labor market, once a pillar of resilience, is now looking more like a late-cycle casualty, as soft data begin to replace soft landings in market discourse,” Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. U.S. futures edged 0.3% higher, however, early Monday. On Friday, the S&P 500 fell 1.6%, its biggest decline since May 21 and its fourth straight loss. It closed at 6,238.01, posting a 2.4% loss for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.2% to 43,588.58, while the Nasdaq composite fell 2.2% to finish at 20,650.13. Internet retail giant Amazon fell 8.3%, despite reporting encouraging profit and sales for its most recent quarter. Technology behemoth Apple fell 2.5% after also beating Wall Street’s profit and revenue forecasts. Both companies face tougher operating conditions because of tariffs, with Apple forecasting a $1.1 billion hit from the fees in the current quarter. Trump’s decision to order the immediate firing of the head of the government agency that produces the monthly jobs figures raised concern over whether there might be interference in future data. The surprisingly weak hiring numbers led investors to step up their expectations the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates in September. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.21% from 4.39% just before the hiring report was released. That’s a big move for the bond market. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which more closely tracks expectations for Fed actions, plunged to 3.68% from 3.94% just prior to the report’s release. The Fed has held rates steady since December. A cut in rates would give the job market and overall economy a boost, but it could also risk fueling inflation, which is hovering stubbornly above the central bank’s 2% target. An update on Thursday for the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation showed that prices ticked higher in June, rising to 2.6% from 2.4% in May. The Fed held rates steady again at its most recent meeting this week. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has been pressured by Trump to cut the benchmark rate, though that decision isn’t his to make alone, but belongs to the 12 members of the Federal Open Market Committee. Businesses, investors and the Fed have been operating under a cloud of uncertainty from Trump’s tariff policy. Companies have been warning investors that unpredictable policies, with some tariffs already in effect while others change or get extended, make it difficult to plan ahead. Walmart, Procter & Gamble and many others also have warned about import taxes raising costs, eating into profits and raising prices for consumers. In other dealings early Monday, U.S, benchmark crude oil lost 18 cents to $67.15 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 23 cents to $69.44 per barrel. The U.S. dollar rose to 147.80 Japanese yen from 147.26 yen. The euro weakened to $1.1577 from $1.1598. Before you consider Amazon.com, you'll want to hear this.

Somalia's camel milk revolution is improving nutrition and creating jobs,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/somalias-camel-milk-revolution-is-improving-nutrition-and-creating-jobs-2025-08-03/,"MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) — Camels have long been the backbone of Somalia 's pastoralist culture, feeding families, transporting goods and standing tall in local folklore. But on the dusty outskirts of the capital, the camel now finds itself at the center of an agricultural revolution that could redefine Somali farming. On a breezy Wednesday morning in mid-June, The Associated Press visited Beder Camel Farm — one of a new generation of camel dairies springing up around Mogadishu. Dozens of camels sauntered around sandy paddocks while others nibbled on fresh fodder under the watchful eyes of herders. In a nearby shed, workers carefully milked the animals and collected the frothy yield in sanitized containers. Demand for camel milk is growing, buoyed by a wave of local entrepreneurs who see untapped potential in a traditional resource. Somalia is home to over 7 million camels — more than any other country on Earth — but only a fraction of that milk has ever reached urban grocery shelves, according to industry estimates. At the heart of the shift toward a modern approach to camel milk production is Dr. Abdirisak Mire Hashi, a veterinarian and the farm’s manager. For Hashi, it's not only about profit — it's about preserving heritage while embracing progress. “Somalis take pride in their heritage of raising camels. However, the way camels are raised has changed significantly over time,"" Hashi told The Associated Press as he inspected a milking herd. Each camel at Beder now produces up to 10 liters (2.6 gallons) of milk daily — double what traditional herders typically yield. The increase is attributed to new investments in veterinary care, better feed, and modern milking practices. The camels are routinely checked by vets, given nutritional supplements, and grazed on scientifically blended fodder, a far cry from the roaming nomadic herds of decades gone by. “We were among the first to establish this kind of farm back in 2006, when very few people even knew about commercial camel milk production,” said Jama Omar, CEO of Beder Camel Farm. “Other farms have entered the market since then, but we currently hold around 40% of the market share.” “We employ nearly 200 full-time staff,” he added. “In addition, we bring in seasonal workers during key periods such as planting and harvest.” The farm’s biggest leap may be its yogurt factory — the first in Somalia dedicated to processing camel milk into yogurt. Inside the factory, workers in white coats oversee stainless steel vats as fresh milk is cultured and packed. The final product is sold under the Beder brand which now retails in urban supermarkets across Mogadishu. Nelson Njoki Githu, a Kenyan-born food engineer overseeing the production line, says camel milk yogurt isn’t just a novelty — it fills an important nutritional gap for local consumers. “The number one benefit compared to cow milk is that camel milk has lower levels of lactose,” Githu explained. “People with lactose intolerance can consume this milk without any issue. Again, the vitamin levels are higher, especially vitamin C, iron and zinc, compared to cow milk.” For nutritionist Dr. Yahye Sholle, camel milk yogurt is a public health boost in a country where malnutrition remains a challenge. “It is rich in magnesium and calcium, which support bone health. Additionally, it contains vitamins B12, C, and D. It also includes friendly bacteria known as probiotics, which are beneficial for gut health,” he said. Such benefits have helped Beder’s yogurt stand out in Mogadishu’s increasingly competitive dairy market. Hashi said the next step is scaling up the business. He hopes to expand Beder’s network of collection points beyond Mogadishu and plans to train pastoralists in remote areas on modern milking and hygiene practices so that more milk can be safely processed and sold. “If we can modernize how we raise camels and handle the milk, we can create jobs, improve nutrition, and build pride in our own local products,” Hashi said. The Somali government is encouraging more investment in the industry. “The benefits of camel milk are countless,” said Dr. Kasim Abdi Moalim, Director of Animal Health at Somalia’s Ministry of Livestock. “In countries like the UAE, camel milk is also used for cosmetics. Somalia must catch up and develop the full value chain.” He said that government support is growing, with the establishment of a Dairy Act and a strategy for livestock sector development. “A master investment plan is also in progress,” he added. Back at the paddock, a line of camels stretches into the golden afternoon light, their steady, patient footsteps a reminder that progress in Somalia often moves at the pace of tradition — slow but unstoppable. From ancient caravans that crossed deserts to supermarket shelves stocked with yogurt, the Somali camel’s journey continues, one cup at a time. ___ For more on Africa and development: https://apnews.com/hub/africa-pulse The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

China pushes back at US demands to stop buying Russian and Iranian oil,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/china-pushes-back-at-us-demands-to-stop-buying-russian-and-iranian-oil-2025-08-03/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. and Chinese officials may be able to settle many of their differences to reach a trade deal and avert punishing tariffs, but they remain far apart on one issue: the U.S. demand that China stop purchasing oil from Iran and Russia. “China will always ensure its energy supply in ways that serve our national interests,” China's Foreign Ministry posted on X on Wednesday following two days of trade negotiations in Stockholm, responding to the U.S. threat of a 100% tariff. “Coercion and pressuring will not achieve anything. China will firmly defend its sovereignty, security and development interests,"" the ministry said. The response is notable at a time when both Beijing and Washington are signaling optimism and goodwill about reaching a deal to keep commercial ties between the world's two largest economies stable — after climbing down from sky-high tariffs and harsh trade restrictions. It underscores China's confidence in playing hardball when dealing with the Trump administration, especially when trade is linked to its energy and foreign policies. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, emerging from the talks, told reporters that when it comes to Russian oil purchases, the ""Chinese take their sovereignty very seriously.” “We don’t want to impede on their sovereignty, so they would like to pay a 100% tariff,"" Bessent said. On Thursday, he called the Chinese “tough” negotiators, but said China's pushback hasn't stalled the negotiations. “I believe that we have the makings of a deal,” Bessent told CNBC. Gabriel Wildau, managing director of the consultancy Teneo, said he doubts President Donald Trump would actually deploy the 100% tariff. “Realizing those threats would derail all the recent progress and probably kill any chance” for Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to announce a trade deal if they should meet this fall, Wildau said. In seeking to restrict oil sales by Russia and Iran, a major source of revenue for both countries, the U.S. wants to reduce the funding available for their militaries, as Moscow pursues its war against Ukraine and Tehran funds militant groups across the Middle East. When Trump unveiled a sweeping plan for tariffs on dozens of countries in April, China was the only country that retaliated. It refused to give in to U.S. pressure. “If the U.S. is bent on imposing tariffs, China will fight to the end, and this is China’s consistent official stance,” said Tu Xinquan, director of the China Institute for WTO Studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. WTO is the acronym for the World Trade Organization. Negotiating tactics aside, China may also suspect that the U.S. won't follow through on its threat, questioning the importance Trump places on countering Russia, Tu said. Scott Kennedy, senior adviser and trustee chair in Chinese Business and Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Beijing is unlikely to change its posture when it sees inconsistencies in U.S. foreign policy goals toward Russia and Iran, whereas Beijing's policy support for Moscow is consistent and clear. It's also possible that Beijing may want to use it as another negotiating tool to extract more concessions from Trump, Kennedy said. Danny Russel, a distinguished fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said Beijing now sees itself as “the one holding the cards in its struggle with Washington."" He said Trump has made it clear he wants a “headline-grabbing deal” with Xi, “so rejecting a U.S. demand to stop buying oil from Iran or Russia is probably not seen as a deal‑breaker, even if it generates friction and a delay."" Continuing to buy oil from Russia preserves Xi's “strategic solidarity” with Russian President Vladimir Putin and significantly reduces the economic costs for China, Russel said. “Beijing simply can’t afford to walk away from the oil from Russia and Iran,"" he said. “It’s too important a strategic energy supply, and Beijing is buying it at fire‑sale prices.” A 2024 report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that roughly 80% to 90% of the oil exported by Iran went to China. The Chinese economy benefits from the more than 1 million barrels of Iranian oil it imports per day. After the Iranian parliament floated a plan to shut down the Strait of Hormuz in June following U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, China spoke out against closing the critical oil transit route. China also is an important customer for Russia, but is second to India in buying Russian seaborne crude oil exports. In April, Chinese imports of Russian oil rose 20% over the previous month to more than 1.3 million barrels per day, according to the KSE Institute, an analytical center at the Kyiv School of Economics. This past week, Trump said the U.S. will impose a 25% tariff on goods from India, plus an additional import tax because of India’s purchasing of Russian oil. India's Foreign Ministry said Friday its relationship with Russia was “steady and time-tested."" Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff and a top policy adviser, said Trump has been clear that it is “not acceptable” for India to continue financing the Ukraine war by purchasing oil from Russia. “People will be shocked to learn that India is basically tied with China in purchasing Russian oil,” Miller said on Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures.” He said the U.S. needs “to get real about dealing with the financing of this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, is pushing for sanctions and tariffs on Russia and its financial backers. In April, he introduced a bill that would authorize the president to impose tariffs as high as 500% not only on Russia but on any country that “knowingly” buys oil, uranium, natural gas, petroleum products or petrochemical products from Russia. ""The purpose of this legislation is to break the cycle of China — a communist dictatorship — buying oil below market price from Putin’s Russia, which empowers his war machine to kill innocent Ukrainian civilians,” Graham said in a June statement. The bill has 84 co-sponsors in the 100-seat Senate. A corresponding House version has been introduced, also with bipartisan support. Republicans say they stand ready to move on the sanctions legislation if Trump asks them to do so, but the bill is on hold for now. ___ Associated Press writers David McHugh in Frankfurt and Rajesh Roy in New Delhi and researcher Yu Bing in Beijing contributed to the report.

Boeing workers who build fighter jets go on strike,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/boeing-workers-who-build-fighter-jets-plan-to-go-on-strike-2025-08-03/,"NEW YORK (AP) — Boeing workers who build fighter jets went on strike Monday at midnight Central Daylight Time. About 3,200 workers at Boeing facilities in St. Louis; St. Charles, Missouri; and Mascoutah, Illinois, voted to reject a modified four-year labor agreement with Boeing, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union said Sunday. In a post on X, the union said: “3,200 highly-skilled IAM Union members at Boeing went on strike at midnight because enough is enough.” The vote followed members’ rejection last week of an earlier proposal from the troubled aerospace giant, which had included a 20% wage increase over four years. “IAM District 837 members build the aircraft and defense systems that keep our country safe,” said Sam Cicinelli, Midwest territory general vice president for the union, in a statement. “They deserve nothing less than a contract that keeps their families secure and recognizes their unmatched expertise.” At the time of the earlier vote, union leaders had recommended approving the offer, calling it a “landmark agreement” and saying it would improve medical, pension and overtime benefits. The union members rejected the latest proposal after a weeklong cooling-off period. “We’re disappointed our employees rejected an offer that featured 40% average wage growth and resolved their primary issue on alternative work schedules,"" said Dan Gillian, Boeing Air Dominance vice president and general manager, and senior St. Louis site executive. ""We are prepared for a strike and have fully implemented our contingency plan to ensure our non-striking workforce can continue supporting our customers.” Boeing has been struggling after two of its Boeing 737 Max airplanes crashed, one in Indonesia in 2018 and the other in Ethiopia in 2019, killing 346 people. In June, one of Boeing's Dreamliner planes, operated by Air India, crashed, killing at least 260 people. Last week, Boeing reported that its second-quarter revenue had improved and losses had narrowed. The company lost $611 million in the second quarter, compared to a loss of $1.44 billion during the same period last year. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

"OPEC+ countries to boost oil production by 547,000 barrels per day",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/opec-countries-to-boost-oil-production-by-547000-barrels-per-day-2025-08-03/,"NEW YORK (AP) — A group of countries that are part of the OPEC+ alliance of oil-exporting countries has agreed to boost oil production, a move some believe could lower oil and gasoline prices, citing a steady global economic outlook and low oil inventories. The group met virtually on Sunday and announced that eight of its member countries would increase oil production by 547,000 barrels per day in September. The countries boosting output, including Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria and Oman, had been participating in voluntary production cuts, initially made in November 2023, which were scheduled to be phased out by September 2026. The announcement means the voluntary production cuts will end ahead of schedule. The move follows an OPEC+ decision in July to boost production by 548,000 barrels per day in August. OPEC said the production adjustments may be paused or reversed as market conditions evolve. When production increases, oil and gasoline prices may fall. But Brent crude oil, which is considered a global benchmark, has been trading near $70 per barrel, which could be due to a potential loss of Russian oil on the market and a large rise in crude inventories in China, according to research firm Clearview Energy Partners. “President Trump has not obviously relented from his threat to sanction Russian energy if the Kremlin does not reach a peace deal with Ukraine as of August 7, potentially via “secondary tariffs” on buyers,” Clearview Energy Partners said in an analyst note Sunday. The eight countries will meet again on Sept. 7, OPEC said in a news release. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

"""The Fantastic Four: First Steps"" holds its lead atop the box office",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-holds-its-lead-atop-the-box-office-2025-08-03/,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Marvel's first family stumbled in theaters in its second weekend, but still held on to the top spot at the box office. “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” earned $40 million from 4,125 North American theaters, a 66% drop from a healthy $117.6 million debut. The film was accompanied by comedies “The Bad Guys 2” and “The Naked Gun"" in the top three box office rankings. The superhero movie dipped significantly more than Marvel's previous film, “Thunderbolts,” which took a 55% dive in its second weekend. “First Steps” is the last major blockbuster of the summer. It added nearly $40 million internationally in its second weekend, bringing thefilm's global total to $369 million. The movie's box office drop off was surprising given its strong reviews, said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for the data firm Comscore. Though the movie’s debut weekend may have given box office results a strong push toward the $4 billion summer benchmark, August is off to a slow start, he said. “It's a tough lift, but we might be able to get there. It really means that all the films are gonna have to stand on their own,” Dergarabedian said. “It’s gonna be about getting great reviews, having that staying power, that longevity in the marketplace.” Newcomer comedy “The Bad Guys 2” earned second place at the box office this weekend, with $22 million from 3,852 North American theaters. That was on par with projections and also in line with the first movie in the series, which brought in $23 million in 2022. Paramount’s slapstick comedy, “The Naked Gun,” also in its debut weekend, snagged the third box office spot, earning $17 million from 3,344 locations. Jim Orr, president of domestic distribution for Universal Pictures, said the solid debut for “The Bad Guys 2,” coupled with strong audience reaction scores, “should point to a very long, very successful run through not only the rest of the summer, but really, I think into the fall."" James Gunn's “Superman,” which opened four weekends ago and already crossed $550 million globally, earned $13.8 million domestically this weekend, taking the fourth spot. “Jurassic World Rebirth” followed with $8.7 million. The horror movie “Together” had a strong debut weekend, coming in at sixth place and earning $6.8 million domestically, proof that August is a month for edgier and off-beat films, Dergarabedian said. “That’s what this month is about. It’s not just about box office,"" Dergarabedian said. ""It’s also about providing really interesting, rewarding movie-going experiences for audiences.” Dergarabedian said he expects highly-anticipated movies hitting theaters in the next few weeks — including “Freakier Friday,” and Zach Cregger’s horror movie “Weapons” — to give August a needed boost. The box office is currently up 9.5% from last year. With final domestic figures being released Monday, this list factors in the estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore: 1. “The Fantastic Four: First Steps,"" $40 million. 2. “The Bad Guys 2,” $22.2 million. 3. “The Naked Gun,” $17 million. 4. “Superman,” $13.8 million. 5. “Jurassic World Rebirth,” $8.7 million. 6. “Together,” $6.8 million. 7. “F1: The Movie,” $4.1 million. 8. “I Know What You Did Last Summer,” $2.7 million. 9. “Smurfs,” $1.8 million. 10. “How to Train Your Dragon,” $1.4 million.

The bodies of all 5 miners are found and identified in Chile's El Teniente mine after collapse,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/chilean-rescuers-recover-the-bodies-of-4-miners-who-were-trapped-in-a-collapsed-shaft-2025-08-03/,"BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — The bodies of all five miners trapped in a collapsed shaft in the world's biggest underground copper mine for three days have been found and identified, an official said Sunday. Aquiles Cubillos, the lead prosecutor in Chile's O'Higgins region, said the body of Moises Pavez, the last miner to remain missing, was found at 3:30 p.m. local time by rescue teams. They had drilled through dozens of meters (feet) of rock to reach the stranded workers. “We deeply regret this outcome” Cubillos said. The five miners were trapped deep inside Chile's El Teniente mine on Thursday after a section of the mine collapsed following a 4.2 magnitude earthquake that instantly killed another miner and injured nine other workers. The trapped miners were located by using GPS devices but rescue teams were not able to communicate with them. Authorities are investigating whether it was a naturally occurring earthquake or whether mining activity at El Teniente caused the tremor. Chilean prosecutors also launched a criminal investigation to determine whether any safety standards were violated. El Teniente, located in the Andes mountains in central Chile, is the world’s largest underground copper mine and is owned by Chilean state company Codelco. Shortly after Thursday’s collapse, Codelco halted operations in the affected section of the mine and evacuated 3,000 people from the broader site to safe areas. The company canceled a presentation of its first-half financial results, set for Friday morning, due to the rescue efforts. Chile, the world’s biggest copper producer, lies in the seismically active “Ring of Fire” that surrounds the shores of the Pacific Ocean. In 2010, Chile's government rescued 33 miners trapped in a copper mine in the country's north for two months in a dramatic operation that made global headlines and was later depicted in a Hollywood movie.

Why Teradyne's 19% Rally Is Just Getting Started,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/why-teradynes-19-rally-is-just-getting-started/,"The stock market often sends investors subtle hints, but on July 30, 2025, its message about Teradyne, Inc. NASDAQ: TER was loud and clear. Shares of the semiconductor test equipment supplier rose higher, closing the day with a nearly 19% gain. Teradyne’s stock price climb seemed to be a decisive response to the company’s latest earnings report. It is being seen as a signal to investors that, for this critical corner of the industry, the long-awaited turnaround may already be underway. A double-digit price move always turns heads, but the real story behind Teradyne's surge lies in the details. The stock’s rally was powered by a trading volume of nearly 20 million shares, a figure more than five times its daily average. Every day, traders rarely drive this kind of activity; it is a clear footprint of institutional capital. When large investment funds and asset managers move in unison to buy a stock, it signals a fundamental belief in a company's improving prospects. This intense buying pressure was likely amplified by another key market dynamic: short interest. Heading into the earnings report, about 4.3% of Teradyne's publicly available shares were sold short. The sudden and strong price jump, like Wednesday's, can trigger a short squeeze. In this scenario, short-sellers rush to buy shares to cut their losses, which in turn pours more fuel on the rally. This secondary wave of forced buying can help solidify the start of a new, sustained uptrend. When a stock moves this rapidly on such high volume, the market is making a definitive statement. Teradyne's second-quarter 2025 earnings report laid bare the reasons for this confidence. The direct instigator of the rally was Teradyne's second-quarter 2025 financial results, which surpassed analyst expectations with revenue of $652 million and non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $0.57. While these numbers were a welcome surprise, the real story is where the growth came from and what it means for the future. The company's Semiconductor Test segment was the clear driver, accounting for $492 million of the total revenue. CEO Greg Smith specified that this strength was primarily due to the high demand for testing System-on-a-Chip (SOC) components used in artificial intelligence (AI). This detail is critical for investors. The semiconductor industry is known for being cyclical, with demand in markets like automotive and consumer electronics rising and falling with the economy. However, the AI revolution represents a powerful secular trend creating a long-term shift that is less dependent on economic cycles. As AI models become more powerful, the chips that run them become exponentially more complex, packing more transistors and consuming more power. These advanced processors, along with the high-bandwidth memory (HBM) they rely on, require more sophisticated, precise, and expensive testing to ensure they work correctly. Teradyne provides the essential equipment for this process. This positions the company as a key beneficiary of the AI build-out, insulating it from the cyclical softness seen in its other markets and creating a durable foundation for growth. While the second-quarter beat was the spark, the company’s outlook for the future is what poured fuel on the fire. Sophisticated investors focus on where a company is going, not just where it has been. Teradyne's guidance for the third quarter of 2025 provided the most compelling evidence that a business recovery is not just beginning but accelerating. The company's projections for the upcoming quarter signal significant forward momentum: This rapid acceleration in sales and earnings is the clearest financial signal that a cyclical bottom has likely passed. A company does not project this level of growth unless it has strong visibility into future demand. Teradyne’s analyst community is now playing catch-up to this new reality. While the average analyst rating on the stock was a Hold before the report, these ratings are often lagging indicators. The more relevant signals are the post-earnings revisions. Firms like UBS have already raised their price targets to $120, reflecting a belief that the company's prospects have materially improved. The evidence paints a clear and cohesive picture. Teradyne's powerful market signal, driven by a durable AI growth engine and confirmed by a forecast for sharply accelerating profitability, makes a compelling case that a new uptrend is underway. For investors monitoring the semiconductor industry for a turning point, the message from Teradyne's performance is unmistakable: the rebound is here, and this rally looks like just the beginning.

Buy the Dip on 3 Overlooked Names With Major Potential,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/buy-the-dip-on-3-overlooked-names-with-major-potential/,"The S&P 500 has risen steadily since a tumble in early April alongside the Trump administration's major tariff announcement. But returns of more than 8% year-to-date (YTD) after a sharp decline at the start of the second quarter may obscure broad uncertainty in the market. Investors saw this in late July as the benchmark index briefly shuddered in response to the latest Fed decision to maintain interest rates amid sticky inflation and pressure from the president. While the threat of volatility may cause investor skittishness, those with a larger appetite for risk can also find some significant bargains by looking for shares of companies that have fallen in recent periods. Timing the market is always a difficult prospect that involves a fair amount of gambling, but each of the companies below has compelling reasons to expect a potential price increase in the future. Qifu Technology Inc. NASDAQ: QFIN is the company behind the Chinese credit-tech platform 360 Jietiao, which matches customers with funding sources and services, among other offerings. QFIN shares have reached as high as $48 this year but plunged in late July to around 70% of that figure. It's an exciting time for Qifu, share price volatility aside. The firm is in the midst of a major rebranding and strategic shift that will see it re-emerge as Qfin Holdings. The company has also achieved several consecutive quarters of strong year-over-year (YOY) profit growth, including a non-GAAP net income increase of 59.9% in the latest quarter. This was likely driven in large part by the company's 15.8% YOY loan facilitation and origination volume improvement for that period. Qifu has a promising new set of partnerships with mid-to-large municipal banks in China—in recent months, the firm has established three such new partnerships, driving loan volume growth of 144% YOY for the company's technology solutions business. Of course, ongoing trade battles between the United States and China are a potential threat and present a source of uncertainty. Still, the company's profitability and risk management success should help it remain resilient despite external threats. Qifu doesn't have significant analyst attention, but all three firms evaluating QFIN shares have assigned them a Buy rating. Formerly known as Chesapeake, Expand Energy Corp. NASDAQ: EXE is a natural gas producer. Natural gas is well-positioned to benefit from increasing energy demands, particularly in the fast-growing AI and data center spaces. Further, Expand is likely to win out from regulatory changes that will discourage renewables such as wind and solar in the United States in the coming years. Despite a recent mixed earnings report in which Expand massively beat analyst predictions for revenue, $3.7 billion reported against an expected $2.1 billion, while also missing EPS estimates by 4 cents per share, the company's combination of strong production, solid reserves, and analyst optimism could drive growth. Shares of EXE experienced a slight bump in the days following the earnings release, but they remained up only 3% YTD after reaching a one-year high in June. With near-unanimous support from analysts, 20 Buy ratings and just one Hold, and a consensus price target suggesting shares could rise by about 25% from current levels, Expand is an energy stock worth watching. Occupying a niche portion of the aviation industry, FTAI Aviation Ltd. NASDAQ: FTAI is known for leasing aircraft and engines and for its repair and other services. The firm's shares jumped by an astonishing 27% on a single day of trading following an earnings report in which FTAI flipped to profit from losses a year earlier. The company's major EPS beat of 24 cents per share is likely due in large part to its strong aerospace product performance and increased module production. The company has managed to increase revenue by more than 52% in the last year while trimming costs, and guidance suggests double-digit growth could continue into the current quarter as well. It's no surprise that all 13 analyst ratings are Buys, and despite the recent rally, the company is not projected to have 19% upside potential of FTAI shares .

Ukrainian anti-corruption agencies uncover drone procurement graft scheme,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/ukrainian-anti-corruption-agencies-uncover-drone-procurement-graft-scheme-2025-08-03/,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine’s anti-corruption agencies said they had uncovered a major graft scheme involving inflated military procurement contracts, just two days after Ukraine’s parliament voted to restore the agencies’ independence. In a joint statement published Saturday on social media, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SAPO) said the suspects had taken bribes in a scheme that used state funds to buy drones and other military equipment at inflated prices. “The essence of the scheme was to conclude state contracts with supplier companies at deliberately inflated prices,” the statement said, adding that offenders had received kickbacks of up to 30% of the contracts’ value. The anti-corruption bodies did not identify the detainees, but said a Ukrainian lawmaker, local district and city officials, and National Guard servicemen were involved. Four people have been arrested so far, they said. The Interior Ministry said the National Guard personnel implicated in the case were removed from their positions. Drones have become a crucial asset in modern warfare for both Ukraine and Russia, enhancing military reconnaissance, precision strikes, and strategic flexibility on the battlefield. The majority of Russian military assets destroyed by Ukrainian forces, including manpower and heavy weaponry, have been targeted by drones. Drone production is also a key aspect of Kyiv's hopes to expand domestic military production and export markets. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed the development in his nightly address on Saturday, calling the graft scheme “absolutely immoral” and thanking the anti-corruption agencies for their work. “Unfortunately, these corruption schemes involved the procurement of electronic warfare systems and FPV drones ... There must be full and fair accountability for this,” he said in his address, posted to X. In an earlier post, which also included photos of him meeting with the agency heads, Zelenskyy said it is “important that anti-corruption institutions operate independently,” adding that “the law passed on Thursday guarantees them all the tools necessary for a real fight against corruption.” The exposure of the graft scheme by NABU and SAPO came just two days after Ukraine’s parliament voted to restore their independence. Ukraine’s Parliament on Thursday overwhelmingly approved the bill presented by Zelenskyy, reversing his earlier contentious move that curbed their power and sparked a backlash, including street protests, a rarity in wartime. Last week’s measure to place the watchdogs under the oversight of the prosecutor-general prompted rebukes from Ukrainians, the European Union and international rights groups. It raised fears that the government could meddle in investigations and potentially shield its supporters from scrutiny. Fighting entrenched corruption is crucial for Ukraine’s aspirations to join the European Union and maintain access to billions of dollars of vital Western aid in the all-out war, now in its fourth year. It’s also an effort that enjoys broad public support. ___ Morton reported from London. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

"Broken altimeter, ignored warnings: Hearings reveal what went wrong in DC crash that killed 67",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/broken-altimeter-ignored-warnings-hearings-reveal-what-went-wrong-in-dc-crash-that-killed-67-2025-08-02/,"Over three days of sometimes contentious hearings this week, the National Transportation Safety Board interrogated Federal Aviation Administration and Army officials about a list of things that went wrong and contributed to a Black Hawk helicopter and a passenger jet colliding over Washington, D.C., killing 67 people. The biggest revelations: The helicopter's altimeter gauge was broken, and controllers warned the FAA years earlier about the dangers that helicopters presented. At one point NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy scolded the FAA for not addressing safety concerns. “Are you kidding me? Sixty-seven people are dead! How do you explain that? Our bureaucratic process?” she said. “Fix it. Do better.” Victims of the January crash included a group of elite young figure skaters, their parents and coaches and four union steamfitters from the Washington area. Here is a look at the major takeaways from the hearings about the collision, which alarmed travelers before a string of other crashes and close calls this year added to their worries about flying: The helicopter was flying at 278 feet (85 meters) — well above the 200-foot (61-meter) ceiling on that route — when it collided with the airliner. But investigators said the pilots might not have realized that because the barometric altimeter they were relying on was reading 80 to 100 feet (24 to 30 meters) lower than the altitude registered by the flight data recorder. The NTSB subsequently found similar discrepancies in the altimeters of three other helicopters from the same unit. An expert with Sikorsky, which makes the Black Hawks, said the one that crashed was an older model that lacked the air data computers that make for more accurate altitude readings in newer versions. Army Chief Warrant Officer Kylene Lewis told the board that an 80- to 100-foot (24- to 30-meter) discrepancy between the different altimeters on a helicopter would not be alarming, because at lower altitudes she would be relying more on the radar altimeter than the barometric altimeter. Plus Army pilots strive to stay within 100 feet (30 meters) of target altitude on flights, so they could still do that even with their altimeters that far off. But Rick Dressler of medevac operator Metro Aviation told the NTSB that imprecision would not fly with his helicopters. When a helicopter route like the one the Black Hawk was flying that night includes an altitude limit, Dressler said, his pilots consider that a hard ceiling. Both tried to deflect responsibility for the crash, but the testimony highlighted plenty of things that might have been done differently. The NTSB’s final report will be done next year, but there likely will not be one single cause identified for the crash. “I think it was a week of reckoning for the FAA and the U.S. Army in this accident,” aviation safety consultant and former crash investigator Jeff Guzzetti said. Army officials said the greater concern is that the FAA approved routes around Ronald Reagan International Airport with separation distances as small as 75 feet (23 meters) between helicopters and planes when planes are landing on a certain runway at Reagan. “The fact that we have less than 500-foot separation is a concern for me,” said Scott Rosengren, chief engineer in the office that manages the Army’s utility helicopters. Army Chief Warrant Officer David Van Vechten said he was surprised the air traffic controller let the helicopter proceed while the airliner was circling to land at Reagan’s secondary runway, which is used when traffic for the main runway stacks up and accounts for about 5% of flights. Van Vechten said he was never allowed to fly under a landing plane as the Black Hawk did, but only a handful of the hundreds of times he flew that route involved planes landing on that runway. Other pilots in the unit told crash investigators it was routine to be directed to fly under landing planes, and they believed that was safe if they stuck to the approved route. Frank McIntosh, the head of the FAA’s air traffic control organization, said he thinks controllers at Reagan “were really dependent upon the use of visual separation” to keep traffic moving through the busy airspace. The NTSB said controllers repeatedly said they would just “make it work.” They sometimes used “squeeze plays” to land planes with minimal separation. On the night of the crash, a controller twice asked the helicopter pilots whether they had the jet in sight, and the pilots said they did and asked for visual separation approval so they could use their own eyes to maintain distance. Testimony at the hearing raised serious questions about how well the crew could spot the plane while wearing night vision goggles and whether the pilots were even looking in the right spot. The controller acknowledged in an interview that the plane’s pilots were never warned when the helicopter was on a collision path, but controllers did not think telling the plane would have made a difference at that point. The plane was descending to land and tried to pull up at the last second after getting a warning in the cockpit, but it was too late. An FAA working group tried to get a warning added to helicopter charts back in 2022 urging pilots to use caution whenever the secondary runway was in use, but the agency refused. The working group said “helicopter operations are occurring in a proximity that has triggered safety events. These events have been trending in the wrong direction and increasing year over year.” Separately, a different group at the airport discussed moving the helicopter route, but those discussions did not go anywhere. And a manager at a regional radar facility in the area urged the FAA in writing to reduce the number of planes taking off and landing at Reagan because of safety concerns. The NTSB has also said the FAA failed to recognize a troubling history of 85 near misses around Reagan in the three years before the collision, NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said “every sign was there that there was a safety risk and the tower was telling you that.” But after the accident, the FAA transferred managers out of the airport instead of acknowledging that they had been warned. “What you did is you transferred people out instead of taking ownership over the fact that everybody in FAA in the tower was saying there was a problem,” Homendy said. “But you guys are pointing out, ‘Welp, our bureaucratic process. Somebody should have brought it up at some other symposium.’” ___ Associated Press writer Leah Askarinam contributed. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

India indicates it will keep buying Russian oil despite Trump's threats,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/india-indicates-it-will-keep-buying-russian-oil-despite-trumps-threats-2025-08-02/,"NEW DELHI (AP) — India has indicated that it would continue buying oil from Russia despite threats by U.S. President Donald Trump. The Indian foreign ministry said its relationship with Russia was “steady and time-tested,” and should not be seen through the prism of a third country. Addressing a weekly presser on Friday, spokesman Randhir Jaiswal said India’s broader stance on securing its energy needs was guided by the availability of oil in the markets and prevailing global circumstances. The comments follow an announcement by President Donald Trump that he intends to impose a 25% tariff on goods from India plus an additional import tax because of New Delhi’s purchases of Russian oil. The threat came as the U.S. president has increasingly soured on Russia for failing to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine and has threatened new economic sanctions if progress is not made. India bought 68,000 barrels per day of crude oil from Russia in January 2022, but by June of same year oil imports rose to 1.12 million barrels per day. The daily imports peaked at 2.15 million in May 2023 and have varied since. Supplies rose as high as nearly 40% of India's imports at one point, making Moscow the largest supplier of crude to New Delhi, the Press Trust of India reported, citing data from Kpler, a data analytics company. India’s daily oil consumption is pegged around 5.5 million barrels, of which nearly 88% is met through imports. The country has historically bought most of its crude from the Middle East, but this has changed since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. India, the world’s third-largest crude importer after China and the U.S., began buying Russian oil available at discounted rates after the West shunned it to punish Moscow.

What to know if you're at risk of having your wages garnished over student loan debt,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/what-to-know-if-youre-at-risk-of-having-your-wages-garnished-over-student-loan-debt-2025-08-02/,"NEW YORK (AP) — Millions of student borrowers could begin having their wages garnished as soon as this summer, according to estimates from credit bureau TransUnion. The company predicts that by August roughly 3 million borrowers could move into default, meaning they're 270 days past due on payments. At that point, loan holders are at risk of having 15% of their pay docked by the government, with the money going toward the outstanding debt. There has been no clear indication of when wage garnishment will start. After the pandemic-era pause on student loan payments ended in May, borrowers have had to reassess the state of their loans and budgets. According to TransUnion, another 2 million borrowers are on course to default in September. A Biden-administration grace period, during which late or missed payments were not counted against credit scores, ended in the fall. Since then, millions of borrowers have seen hits to their credit ratings. Here's what to know: “The most important thing borrowers can do before administrative wage garnishment restarts is to log into studentaid.gov to check whether their federal student loans are in default and take steps now to remove them from default,” said Kyra Taylor, staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center. Taylor said it's not uncommon for borrowers to be unaware that their loans are in default. If borrowers attended college or graduate school during different periods of time, or if they have different federal loan types, they may also have multiple student loan servicers. If that's the case, you should act now to get your loans out of default and back into good standing by either entering a rehabilitation agreement, where you must make nine consecutive payments based on their income, or by consolidating your loans into a new federal Direct Loan. “Because this hasn’t happened for so long, there are many people who have no idea they’re at risk,"" said Aissa Canchola Bañez, policy director at the Student Borrower Protection Center. Wait times for student borrowers attempting to contact their loan servicers have been long, with many dropped calls, in part due to layoffs at the Education Department. Bañez recommends contacting your congressperson, using a casework tool that can guide you through submitting a constituent request. “These offices have entire teams dedicated to constituent casework for when you have an issue with a federal agency, such as the Department of Education,” she said. “So you can request assistance from your member of congress — your representative or senator.” Until past due payments are paid or the loan's default status is resolved, borrowers are at risk of having up to 15% of their wages deducted directly from their paychecks. The Department of Education has sent notices to borrowers warning that tax refunds and wages could be withheld starting this summer if borrowers don’t take steps to restart payments. The department hasn’t yet provided additional information on timing. Richelle Brooks, 37, an education administrator based in Los Angeles, said she's received warnings and notices about the resumption of collection of her loans. For several degrees, she still has $239,000 in outstanding debt, and she was informed her monthly payments on those loans will be roughly $3,000. “I can't afford it,” she said. “We just came out of the moratorium — not paying for five years. People getting these notices — they're terrified. I'm uneasy, too."" Brooks said she's an informed borrower who stays up to date on each development and who knows her options. She plans to enroll in coding classes, at least half-time, which could place her loans in deferment, so she wouldn't be required to make monthly payments, while she makes a financial plan. There's still time to take action. According to Taylor, the Department of Education must provide 30 days notice before it sends a garnishment order to your employer. During that time, you can request a hearing to object by telling the department that the garnishment would cause you financial hardship. You can also request that the department reduce the amount being garnished and submit documentation about your income and expenses. To do this, you must make your hearing request in writing, postmarked no later than 30 days after the garnishment order. Your loan holder will then arrange the hearing. If you're unsure who your loan holder is, you can contact the Education Department's Default Resolution Group. If you were laid off from your last job, you can also object to garnishment if you have not been in your current job for 12 consecutive months. You can further request a hearing and object if you submitted an application for certain kinds of statutory discharges and those have not yet been decided. Some common reasons for statutory discharge of student loans include: if the school you attended closed before you could complete your degree, if your school owes you a refund but fails to pay it, if you're experiencing total disability, or if you're experiencing bankruptcy. “If the borrower requests a hearing within 30 days after receiving the garnishment notice, the department cannot start garnishment until it issues a decision on the borrower’s objections and financial hardship request,” Taylor said. You can request a hearing after the 30 day period is up, but in those cases the department will generally not stop garnishing your wages while the hearing request is pending. ___ The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

"From Laos to Brazil, Trump's tariffs leave a lot of losers. But even the winners will pay a price",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/from-laos-to-brazil-trumps-tariffs-leave-a-lot-of-losers-but-even-the-winners-will-pay-a-price-2025-08-02/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s tariff onslaught this week left a lot of losers – from small, poor countries like Laos and Algeria to wealthy U.S. trading partners like Canada and Switzerland. They’re now facing especially hefty taxes – tariffs – on the products they export to the United States starting Aug. 7. The closest thing to winners may be the countries that caved to Trump's demands — and avoided even more pain. But it's unclear whether anyone will be able to claim victory in the long run — even the United States, the intended beneficiary of Trump’s protectionist policies. “In many respects, everybody’s a loser here,’’ said Barry Appleton, co-director of the Center for International Law at the New York Law School. Barely six months after he returned to the White House, Trump has demolished the old global economic order. Gone is one built on agreed-upon rules. In its place is a system in which Trump himself sets the rules, using America’s enormous economic power to punish countries that won’t agree to one-sided trade deals and extracting huge concessions from the ones that do. “The biggest winner is Trump,” said Alan Wolff, a former U.S. trade official and deputy director-general at the World Trade Organization. “He bet that he could get other countries to the table on the basis of threats, and he succeeded – dramatically.’’ Everything goes back to what Trump calls “Liberation Day’’ – April 2 – when the president announced “reciprocal’’ taxes of up to 50% on imports from countries with which the United States ran trade deficits and 10% “baseline’’ taxes on almost everyone else. He invoked a 1977 law to declare the trade deficit a national emergency that justified his sweeping import taxes. That allowed him to bypass Congress, which traditionally has had authority over taxes, including tariffs — all of which is now being challenged in court. Trump retreated temporarily after his Liberation Day announcement triggered a rout in financial markets and suspended the reciprocal tariffs for 90 days to give countries a chance to negotiate. Eventually, some of them did, caving to Trump’s demands to pay what four months ago would have seemed unthinkably high tariffs for the privilege of continuing to sell into the vast American market. The United Kingdom agreed to 10% tariffs on its exports to the United States — up from 1.3% before Trump amped up his trade war with the world. The U.S. demanded concessions even though it had run a trade surplus, not a deficit, with the UK for 19 straight years. The European Union and Japan accepted U.S. tariffs of 15%. Those are much higher than the low single-digit rates they paid last year — but lower than the tariffs he was threatening (30% on the EU and 25% on Japan). Also cutting deals with Trump and agreeing to hefty tariffs were Pakistan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines. Even countries that saw their tariffs lowered from April without reaching a deal are still paying much higher tariffs than before Trump took office. Angola's tariff, for instance, dropped to 15% from 32% in April, but in 2022 it was less than 1.5%. And while Trump administration cut Taiwan's tariff to 20% from 32% in April, the pain will still be felt. “20% from the beginning has not been our goal, we hope that in further negotiations we will get a more beneficial and more reasonable tax rate,” Taiwan’s president Lai Ching-te told reporters in Taipei Friday. Trump also agreed to reduce the tariff on the tiny southern African kingdom of Lesotho to 15% from the 50% he’d announced in April, but the damage may already have been done there. Countries that didn't knuckle under — and those that found other ways to incur Trump's wrath — got hit harder. Even some poorer countries were not spared. Laos' annual economic output comes to $2,100 per person and Algeria's $5,600 — versus America's $75,000. Nonetheless, Laos got rocked with a 40% tariff and Algeria with a 30% levy. Trump slammed Brazil with a 50% import tax largely because he didn't like the way it was treating former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who is facing trial for trying to lose his electoral defeat in 2022. Never mind that the U.S. has exported more to Brazil than it's imported every year since 2007. Trump's decision to plaster a 35% tariff on longstanding U.S. ally Canada was partly designed to threaten Ottawa for saying it would recognize a Palestinian state. Trump is a staunch supporter of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Switzerland was clobbered with a 39% import tax — even higher than the 31% Trump originally announced on April 2. ""The Swiss probably wish that they had camped in Washington'' to make a deal, said Wolff, now senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. ""They’re clearly not at all happy.’’ Fortunes may change if Trump's tariffs are upended in court. Five American businesses and 12 states are suing the president, arguing that his Liberation Day tariffs exceeded his authority under the 1977 law. In May, the U.S. Court of International Trade, a specialized court in New York, agreed and blocked the tariffs, although the government was allowed to continue collecting them while its appeal wend its way through the legal system, and may likely end up at the U.S. Supreme Court. In a hearing Thursday, the judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit sounded skeptical about Trump's justifications for the tariffs. “If (the tariffs) get struck down, then maybe Brazil’s a winner and not a loser,’’ Appleton said. Trump portrays his tariffs as a tax on foreign countries. But they are actually paid by import companies in the U.S. who try to pass along the cost to their customers via higher prices. True, tariffs can hurt other countries by forcing their exporters to cut prices and sacrifice profits — or risk losing market share in the United States. But economists at Goldman Sachs estimate that overseas exporters have absorbed just one-fifth of the rising costs from tariffs, while Americans and U.S. businesses have picked up the most of the tab. Walmart, Procter & Gamble, Ford, Best Buy, Adidas, Nike, Mattel and Stanley Black & Decker, have all hiked prices due to U.S. tariffs ""This is a consumption tax, so it disproportionately affects those who have lower incomes,'' Appleton said. “Sneakers, knapsacks ... your appliances are going to go up. Your TV and electronics are going to go up. Your video game devices, consoles are going to up because none of those are made in America.’’ Trump’s trade war has pushed the average U.S. tariff from 2.5% at the start of 2025 to 18.3% now, the highest since 1934, according to the Budget Lab at Yale University. And that will impose a $2,400 cost on the average household, the lab estimates. “The U.S. consumer’s a big loser,″ Wolff said. ____ AP Economics Writer Christopher Rugaber contributed to this story.

Bitcoin and Dividends: A Winning Combo in These 3 ETFs,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/bitcoin-and-dividends-a-winning-combo-in-these-3-etfs/,"With Bitcoin trading just below all-time highs, there is fresh attention on the world's first and largest cryptocurrency. Investors concerned about the future of the dollar may also be inclined to turn to crypto, though the space remains highly speculative. If the risk of investing directly in Bitcoin or another major token is too high, an alternative is a cryptocurrency-focused exchange-traded fund (ETF). The most straightforward crypto funds are spot ETFs like the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund NYSEARCA: FBTC. These funds invest directly in Bitcoin and are thus highly risky, although they do provide a layer of protection for investors in that investors don't have to store and transfer crypto holdings by themselves. An income-generating Bitcoin fund may be a better alternative for less risk-tolerant investors. These funds typically use crypto futures, covered calls, and other complex strategies to generate distributions that function similarly to dividend payments made by traditional stocks. Of course, tax implications in these cases may be different, so it's up to the investor to keep track of the implications. One way to generate income for investors is with call options on Bitcoin futures ETFs, and that's exactly the play that the NEOS Bitcoin High Income ETF NYSEARCA: BTCI aims for. This fund invests in exchange-traded products (ETPs) directly exposed to Bitcoin. BTCI is actively managed, meaning that the team from NEOS makes decisions about how and when to utilize call options to maximize distributions while also achieving upside potential. BTCI is one of the newer ETFs in the Bitcoin and crypto space, having only launched late in 2024. However, its track record so far is highly successful; it has returned more than 26% in 2025 alone. This is in addition to monthly distributions, which have provided the fund with a dividend yield of 22.2%. Investors should expect to pay for this fund's active management. BTCI, unsurprisingly, has a fairly high expense ratio of 0.98%. Far cheaper crypto funds are available, but many investors may find the fund's track record and history of distributions to more than make up for the comparably high cost. For a bit more diversification outside of the Bitcoin space, investors might look to the Global X Blockchain & Bitcoin Strategy ETF NASDAQ: BITS. BITS does include a focus on the Bitcoin futures market, but it also aims for exposure to stocks of companies in the blockchain technology and digital assets industries as well as other ETFs focused on blockchain. BITS has traditionally offered investors a distribution twice per year, translating to an annual dividend yield of 24.5%. Considering the fund's substantial payouts and active strategy combining cryptocurrency with traditional stocks and ETFs, the fund's expense ratio of 0.65% is relatively low. Its year-to-date (YTD) return of roughly 18% is likely quite compelling. Investors should be aware, though, that BITS has quite low assets under management (AUM) at just $35.4 million and low trading volume, which may make liquidity a concern for more active traders. The first Bitcoin-related ETF to launch in the United States was the ProShares Bitcoin ETF NYSEARCA: BITO. However, BITO does not invest directly in Bitcoin; instead, it invests in futures and swaps. As might be expected for the first-ever Bitcoin fund, BITO has substantially higher AUM and trading volume than BITS above, with about $2.8 billion in invested assets. Distributions are also a popular draw for BITO investors, as the fund makes monthly payments and has a dividend yield of 49.6%. With an expense ratio of 0.95%, BITO remains on the higher end of the expense ratio scale for Bitcoin funds, but the fund's strong history, its distributions, and recent performance likely make that a worthwhile fee for many investors. BITO has returned about 21% so far this year, far ahead of the broader market. Before you consider NEOS Bitcoin High Income ETF, you'll want to hear this.

Profits drop at Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway as it writes down its Kraft Heinz investment,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/profits-drop-at-warren-buffetts-berkshire-hathaway-as-it-writes-down-its-kraft-heinz-investment-2025-08-02/,"OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Warren Buffett's company reported less than half as much profit in the second quarter as it took a $3.76 billion writedown on the value of its stake in Kraft Heinz, as that iconic food producer considers largely undoing the merger that Berkshire Hathaway helped bankroll. Berkshire said it earned $12.37 billion, or $8,601 per Class A share, during the quarter. That's down from $30.248 billion, or $21,122 per Class A share, a year ago, because it recorded a much smaller paper investment gain this year. Berkshire's earnings can swing wildly from quarter to quarter because it has to record the current value of its massive investment portfolio even though it doesn't sell most of the stocks. That's why Buffett has long recommended that investors pay more attention to Berkshire's operating earnings, which exclude those investment gains. Although last year Berkshire did surprise shareholders by selling off a huge chunk of its Apple stake which inflated the investment gains then. By that measure, Berkshire's operating earnings were only down slightly at $11.16 billion, or $7,759.58 per Class A share. That compares with $11.598 billion, or $8,072.16 per Class A share, a year ago. Most of Berkshire's myriad assortment of companies — major insurers like Geico, BNSF railroad, a group of utilities and a collection of manufacturing and retail businesses — generally performed well despite the uncertainty about the economy and President Donald Trump's tariffs. The four analysts surveyed by FactSet Research expected Berkshire to report earnings per Class A share of $7,508.10, so the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate's results were ahead of that. Berkshire owns more than 27% of Kraft Heinz' stock and, for years, it had representatives on the company's board. Buffett has said previously that he believes the company's iconic brands will do well over time, but in hindsight, he overpaid for the investment and underestimated the challenges branded foods face from retailers and the growth of private label products. This spring, Berkshire's representatives resigned from the Kraft Heinz board shortly before the company announced it is exploring strategic options that may include spinning off a large part of its portfolio of brands. Over the years since Berkshire helped Kraft buy Heinz in 2015, the company has been hurt by changing consumer tastes and a shift toward healthier options than Kraft’s core collection of processed foods. Another writedown could be coming in the future because CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert pointed out that Berkshire's holding of 28% of Occidental Petroleum's stock, which is currently valued at about $5.3 billion less than the $16.5 billion that Buffett paid for it. Buffett's is still sitting on a massive pile of $344.1 billion in cash, although the company's reserves dipped slightly from the $347.7 billion cash it was holding at the end of the first quarter. Buffett told shareholders in May he just isn't finding any attractive deals for companies he understands. Buffett surprised shareholders at the annual meeting when he announced that he plans to give up the CEO title at the end of the year and hand over operations to Vice Chairman Greg Abel, but Buffett will remain Chairman. Berkshire shareholders might be disappointed that the company didn't repurchase any of its shares this quarter, even though the price has fallen more than 12% since just before Buffett announced his retirement. But investor Chris Ballard, who is managing director at Check Capital, said he wasn't surprised at the lack of buybacks because even after the recent drop, Berkshire's stock is still selling at a premium compared to the value of its businesses. Many investors are watching Berkshire's BNSF closely after rival Union Pacific announced a plan to buy Norfolk Southern earlier this week to create the nation's first transcontinental railroad. The speculation is that BNSF needs to pursue a merger with eastern rail CSX to be able to compete. But Seifert said it isn't Buffett's style to jump into a deal just because the market thinks he should. Over the decades, he has built Berkshire by finding strong companies selling for less than they are worth. CSX is trading near its 52-week high at $35.01 amid all the deal speculation. “He wants to do it because he found an undervalued franchise -- not because the market says you need to do a deal,” Seifert said. “I think one of the reasons why that cash hasn’t been deployed is that valuations run through the Berkshire M-and-A model tend to be too rich. But if there’s a logical case to be made they’ll accept it.” And BNSF appears to be doing fine right now on its own. The railroad recorded a 19% jump in its operating profit this quarter at $1.47 billion as it cut costs and delivered about 1% more shipments. Berkshire's insurance results disappointed a bit as it appeared the company might be pulling back from writing as much property insurance at a time when premiums aren't as attractive. Even in areas where it is growing, like Geico, Seifert said Berkshire lagged behind peers such as Progressive and Allstate. Berkshire normally pulls back on writing insurance when it doesn't like the premiums. “The insurance business has struggled a bit. I would say the takeaways for me is on that front, they’re doing less property and casualty insurance,” said Ballard, who's firm counts Berkshire as its largest holding. Berkshire said it's underwriting operating profit dipped to just below $2 billion in the quarter from last year's $2.26 billion. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

Is PG&E an AI Power Play? Why Options Traders Are Betting Big,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/is-pg-and-e-an-ai-power-play-why-options-traders-are-betting-big/,"Utility stocks are typically known for their predictability, not for explosive growth. It is especially noteworthy, then, when market indicators begin flashing for one of the utility sector’s most-watched companies. For Pacific Gas & Electric NYSE: PCG, a dramatic, recent spike in bullish activity suggests some professional investors believe the company is at a major inflection point. This unusual interest warrants a deeper look into the fundamental drivers that could be fueling a powerful turnaround, one that links the future of California's power grid to the global boom in artificial intelligence (AI). A clear signal of shifting sentiment appeared on July 25, when the trading volume of bullish call options for PG&E stock soared by over 380% compared to its daily average. A call option gives an investor the right to buy a stock at a specific price in the future, making it a direct bet on a price increase. A surge of this magnitude signals a wave of new confidence. A closer look at the trading data shows significant interest in options expiring in September 2025 with ""strike prices"" of $16, $19, and $20 per share. With PG&E’s stock price currently trading in the 13-14 range, this pattern reveals that investors are positioning for a sustained rally. They are betting on a potential upside of 20% to 50% over the coming months, which raises a critical question: What fundamentals justify such optimism? The justification for this bullish sentiment is found in the company's second-quarter 2025 earnings report. The results paint a picture of a business that is successfully stabilizing its operations and finances. The company confidently reaffirmed its full-year non-GAAP core earnings per share (EPS) guidance of $1.48 to $1.52. This signals that management's plan is on track, providing the predictability investors value. This stability is built on a foundation of tangible operational achievements that reduce risk. The company is also managing its regulatory environment more proactively. It recently submitted its smallest rate increase request in a decade. While legislative debates in Sacramento remain a key watch item, earnings call that the company's $63 billion, five-year financial plan can withstand various outcomes, CEO Patti Poppe stated on the call without diluting shareholder value by issuing new stock at current prices. While a stable foundation is essential, the catalyst igniting genuine investor excitement is a powerful, new growth engine. PG&E’s earnings report revealed that demand for its new data center pipeline has swelled to an immense 10 gigawatts. This surge is a direct result of the artificial intelligence revolution centered in PG&E’s Northern California service area. The massive server farms required for AI development consume vast amounts of electricity, giving PG&E a unique growth opportunity that most other utilities lack. For investors, this new demand is the engine of future profit. Meeting this demand will require billions in new infrastructure investment. For a regulated utility, these capital investments are added to its rate base, which is the core asset portfolio on which the company earns a guaranteed profit. This growth in the rate base directly supports the company's goal of delivering at least 9% annual EPS growth through 2028. This growth story also presents a winning narrative for customers and regulators. As management explained, every gigawatt of new data center load can reduce residential bills by 1-2%, as the grid's high fixed costs are spread over more sales. Confirmed projects with major tech players like Microsoft NASDAQ: MSFT make this growth feel tangible and imminent, positioning PG&E as a key partner in the AI economy. The recent surge in bullish options trading appears to be a rational market signal indicating PG&E's fundamental transformation. The company is successfully moving beyond its recovery phase by stabilizing its operations and proactively managing its risks. More importantly, it has secured a robust, long-term growth catalyst by positioning itself as the energy backbone for the AI industry. For a company long defined by its past challenges, the narrative is compellingly shifting to one of durable, technology-driven growth.

MarketBeat Week in Review – 07/28 - 08/01,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/marketbeat-week-in-review-07-28-08-01/,"Stocks drifted lower to end the week as economic uncertainty overshadowed strong Magnificent Seven earnings. On July 31, the latest Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index showed a slight uptick in the rate of inflation growth. Then on Friday, the August Jobs report came in lighter than expected. However, that number looked bullish compared with massive downward revisions to the May and June numbers. Investors are also weighing the impact of tariffs now that the August 1 deadline has come and gone. On a more bullish note, reports from several mega-cap technology companies reinforce the reality of the artificial intelligence (AI) trade. Many of these companies will spend billions of dollars over several years to build out an AI infrastructure, creating opportunities in several sectors. Next week will be quieter for economic data, but earnings season will continue to roll along. August itself is typically a quiet week for markets. But that low volume can also lead to high volatility. Count on the MarketBeat analysts to help you separate market signals from noise. Here are some of our most popular articles from this week. Articles by Sam Quirke One week after its earnings report, Tesla Inc. NASDAQ: TSLA stock has given up almost all of its post-earnings gains. However, Sam Quirke pointed out why the long-term upside continues to look bullish as Tesla’s robotics and autonomous vehicle solutions begin to emerge. Amazon.com Inc. NASDAQ: AMZN stock dropped despite a solid earnings report. It’s just one example of how investors had priced growth into the company’s results. Quirke explained the long-term bull case and how investors and traders may want to approach the stock. NVIDIA Corp. NASDAQ: NVDA would appear to be a winner as AI spending shows no signs of slowing down. Quirke pointed to two technical indicators that look bearish for NVDA stock despite continued optimism from analysts. Articles by Chris Markoch Palantir Technologies Inc. NASDAQ: PLTR reports earnings next week. Chris Markoch explained why investors will want to pay close attention to the company’s growing defense business as the company becomes the Pentagon’s go-to AI engine. Stocks that form a golden cross pattern can be opportunities for investors. Markoch highlighted three stocks that have recently made a golden cross that is supported by strong fundamentals. Apple Inc. NASDAQ: AAPL delivered a strong earnings report on July 31. However, AAPL stock is delivering muted gains. Markoch explained why investors are skeptical about the sustainability of the company’s results, and what that may mean for a stock that many believe is still priced for perfection. Articles by Ryan Hasson Bitcoin has made a resurgence in July, and this time it’s bringing other tokens with it. This week, Ryan Hasson looked at five stocks set to ride the wave of the crypto surge that investors can own without owning and storing the digital assets. Autonomous technology is the bullish cousin to artificial intelligence. This week, Hasson looked at this sector and provided investors with five autonomous technology stocks trading for less than $15. That means there’s some risk and the potential for outsized gains for patient investors. Hasson also looked at two cybersecurity stocks that are poised for a breakout. As interest in AI continues to grow, so will the threats from AI-driven cyberattacks. Hasson explained why upcoming earnings may be the catalyst that moves these stocks higher. Articles by Gabriel Osorio-Mazilli This week, Gabriel Osorio-Mazilli analyzed the surge in American Eagle Outfitters Inc. NYSE: AEO. More importantly, he looked beyond the noise and explained why the move in AEO stock may have more behind it than speculation. With so many stocks trading at or near all-time highs, it can be hard to find undervalued stocks. However, that’s exactly what Osorio-Mazilli did this week. Not only did he provide investors with the names of three undervalued stocks, but he also pointed out why each has catalysts that the market may be overlooking. Buy-and-hold investors understand the importance of compounding. This week, Osorio-Mazilli pointed these investors to three stocks with attractive outlooks for compounding for years to come. Articles by Leo Miller Investors expected a strong earnings report from Meta Platforms Inc. NASDAQ: META, and the company did not disappoint. Leo Miller summarized the tech giant's strong report and explained why investors should be willing to chase META stock higher. Earnings season is a time when investors seek out analyst upgrades. This week, Miller highlighted three AI stocks that have received bullish upgrades after reporting strong earnings. Earnings season can also be synonymous with stock buybacks. Although that hasn’t been a prominent factor so far in this cycle, Miller highlighted four stocks that have announced significant increases in Q2 buybacks. Articles by Nathan Reiff D-Wave Quantum Inc. NYSE: QBTS has been one of the best-performing stocks in the emerging quantum stock sector. This week, Nathan Reiff pointed out the catalysts that briefly allowed QBTS stock to make a new all-time high, but why investors may still want to proceed with caution. Investors have been waiting for basic materials stocks to take off. However, uncertainty in key economic indicators has weighed on these stocks. Reiff explained why three material stocks are likely to have further upside based on fundamentals and market trends. Defense stocks have been some of the most closely watched stocks for investors. Reiff pointed out why a beaten-down small-cap stock, Byrna Technologies Inc. NASDAQ: BYRN, is one to watch based on bullish analyst sentiment and a strong earnings report. Articles by Dan Schmidt History frequently rhymes, and Dan Schmidt pointed out why 2025 is starting to look a lot like 2021. In both cases, traders were looking for short squeeze candidates. This is a risky strategy, but it can be profitable. Schmidt highlighted three stocks with catalysts that could make them good short-squeeze candidates. It hasn’t been all bad news on the tariff front, Schmidt pointed out why the recent deal between the United States and Japan is bullish for automotive stocks. Schmidt highlighted three automaker stocks that investors may be overlooking. Articles by Jeffrey Neal Johnson “The quantum computing industry is reaching an inflection point.” Jeffrey Neal Johnson highlighted this issue for investors. Johnson explained the key factors driving quantum stocks higher and gave investors three stocks that are among the most promising for long-term investors. Drone stocks have been soaring, which is why Johnson made it a point to highlight Red Cat Holdings Inc. NASDAQ: RCAT. The stock has dropped recently, but a new contract is only one reason why analysts believe there’s significant upside to come. As the AI revolution progresses, investors will want to watch applications on the edge. This week, Johnson pointed out that its application of semiconductors in automotive and internet of Things (IoT) applications makes Qualcomm Inc. NASDAQ: QCOM a growth stock that may be flying under the radar. Articles by Jordan Chussler Healthcare is normally an evergreen sector for investors. However, that hasn’t been the case for several years. Jordan Chussler analyzed the headwinds impacting the healthcare sector and why that adds to the bullish case for HCA Healthcare Inc. NYSE: HCA, which recently issued bullish forward guidance. Before you consider HCA Healthcare, you'll want to hear this.

SpaceX delivers four astronauts to the International Space Station just 15 hours after launch,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/astronauts-take-express-flight-to-the-space-station-arriving-15-hours-after-their-launch-2025-08-02/,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — SpaceX delivered a fresh crew to the International Space Station on Saturday, making the trip in a quick 15 hours. The four U.S., Russian and Japanese astronauts pulled up in their SpaceX capsule after launching from NASA's Kennedy Space Center. They will spend at least six months at the orbiting lab, swapping places with colleagues up there since March. SpaceX will bring those four back as early as Wednesday. Moving in are NASA's Zena Cardman and Mike Fincke, Japan's Kimiya Yui and Russia's Oleg Platonov — each of whom had been originally assigned to other missions. “Hello, space station!” Fincke radioed as soon as the capsule docked high above the South Pacific. Cardman and another astronaut were pulled from a SpaceX flight last year to make room for NASA's two stuck astronauts, Boeing Starliner test pilots Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, whose space station stay went from one week to more than nine months. Fincke and Yui had been training for the next Starliner mission. But with Starliner grounded by thruster and other problems until 2026, the two switched to SpaceX. Platonov was bumped from the Soyuz launch lineup a couple of years ago because of an undisclosed illness. Their arrival temporarily puts the space station population at 11. “It was such an unbelievably beautiful sight to see the space station come into our view for the first time,” Cardman said once on board. While their taxi flight was speedy by U.S. standards, the Russians hold the record for the fastest trip to the space station — a lightning-fast three hours. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

It's Trump's economy now. The latest financial numbers offer some warning signs,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/its-trumps-economy-now-the-latest-financial-numbers-offer-some-warning-signs-2025-08-01/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — For all of President Donald Trump’s promises of an economic “golden age,” a spate of weak indicators this week told a potentially worrisome story as the impacts of his policies are coming into focus. Job gains are dwindling. Inflation is ticking upward. Growth has slowed compared with last year. More than six months into his term, Trump’s blitz of tariff hikes and his new tax and spending bill have remodeled America’s trading, manufacturing, energy and tax systems to his own liking. He’s eager to take credit for any wins that might occur and is hunting for someone else to blame if the financial situation starts to totter. But as of now, this is not the boom the Republican president promised, and his ability to blame his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden, for any economic challenges has faded as the world economy hangs on his every word and social media post. When Friday’s jobs report turned out to be decidedly bleak, Trump ignored the warnings in the data and fired the head of the agency that produces the monthly jobs figures. “Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can’t be manipulated for political purposes,” Trump said on Truth Social, without offering evidence for his claim. “The Economy is BOOMING.” It’s possible that the disappointing numbers are growing pains from the rapid transformation caused by Trump and that stronger growth will return — or they may be a preview of even more disruption to come. Trump's aggressive use of tariffs, executive actions, spending cuts and tax code changes carries significant political risk if he is unable to deliver middle-class prosperity. The effects of his new tariffs are still several months away from rippling through the economy, right as many Trump allies in Congress will be campaigning in the midterm elections. “Considering how early we are in his term, Trump’s had an unusually big impact on the economy already,” said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist at Firehouse Strategies. “The full inflationary impact of the tariffs won’t be felt until 2026. Unfortunately for Republicans, that’s also an election year.” The White House portrayed the blitz of trade frameworks leading up to Thursday's tariff announcement as proof of his negotiating prowess. The European Union, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Indonesia and other nations that the White House declined to name agreed that the U.S. could increase its tariffs on their goods without doing the same to American products. Trump simply set rates on other countries that lacked settlements. The costs of those tariffs — taxes paid on imports to the U.S. — will be most felt by many Americans in the form of higher prices, but to what extent remains uncertain. “For the White House and their allies, a key part of managing the expectations and politics of the Trump economy is maintaining vigilance when it comes to public perceptions,” said Kevin Madden, a Republican strategist. Just 38% of adults approve of Trump’s handling of the economy, according to a July poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs. That’s down from the end of Trump’s first term when half of adults approved of his economic leadership. The White House paints a rosier image, seeing the economy emerging from a period of uncertainty after Trump’s restructuring and repeating the economic gains seen in his first term before the pandemic struck. “President Trump is implementing the very same policy mix of deregulation, fairer trade, and pro-growth tax cuts at an even bigger scale – as these policies take effect, the best is yet to come,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said. The economic numbers over the past week show the difficulties that Trump might face if the numbers continue on their current path: — Friday's jobs report showed that U.S. employers have shed 37,000 manufacturing jobs since Trump's tariff launch in April, undermining prior White House claims of a factory revival. — Net hiring has plummeted over the past three months with job gains of just 73,000 in July, 14,000 in June and 19,000 in May — a combined 258,000 jobs lower than previously indicated. On average last year, the economy added 168,000 jobs a month. — A Thursday inflation report showed that prices have risen 2.6% over the year that ended in June, an increase in the personal consumption expenditures price index from 2.2% in April. Prices of heavily imported items, such as appliances, furniture, and toys and games, jumped from May to June. — On Wednesday, a report on gross domestic product — the broadest measure of the U.S. economy — showed that it grew at an annual rate of less than 1.3% during the first half of the year, down sharply from 2.8% growth last year. “The economy's just kind of slogging forward,” said Guy Berger, senior fellow at the Burning Glass Institute, which studies employment trends. “Yes, the unemployment rate’s not going up, but we’re adding very few jobs. The economy’s been growing very slowly. It just looks like a ‘meh’ economy is continuing.” Trump has sought to pin the blame for any economic troubles on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, saying the Fed should cut its benchmark interest rates even though doing so could generate more inflation. Trump has publicly backed two Fed governors, Christoper Waller and Michelle Bowman, for voting for rate cuts at Wednesday's meeting. But their logic is not what the president wants to hear: They were worried, in part, about a slowing job market. But this is a major economic gamble being undertaken by Trump and those pushing for lower rates under the belief that mortgages will also become more affordable as a result and boost homebuying activity. His tariff policy has changed repeatedly over the last six months, with the latest import tax numbers serving as a substitute for what the president announced in April, which provoked a stock market sell-off. It might not be a simple one-time adjustment as some Fed board members and Trump administration officials argue. Of course, Trump can't say no one warned him about the possible consequences of his economic policies. Biden, then the outgoing president, did just that in a speech last December at the Brookings Institution, saying the cost of the tariffs would eventually hit American workers and businesses. “He seems determined to impose steep, universal tariffs on all imported goods brought into this country on the mistaken belief that foreign countries will bear the cost of those tariffs rather than the American consumer,” Biden said. “I believe this approach is a major mistake.” Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

"Who is Erika McEntarfer, the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner fired by Trump?",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/who-is-erika-mcentarfer-the-bureau-of-labor-statistics-commissioner-fired-by-trump-2025-08-01/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The head of the agency that compiles the closely watched monthly jobs report usually toils in obscurity, but on Friday, the current holder of that job was loudly fired by the president of the United States. Erika McEntarfer, a longtime government employee, bore the brunt of President Donald Trump’s unhappiness with Friday’s jobs report, which showed that hiring had slowed in July and was much less in May and June that previously estimated. He accused her without evidence of manipulating the job numbers and noted she was an appointee of President Joe Biden. McEntarfer, a longtime government worker who had served as BLS head for a year and a half, did not immediately respond to a request for comment by The Associated Press. But her predecessor overseeing the jobs agency, former co-workers and associates have denounced the firing, warning about its repercussions and saying McEntarfer was nonpolitical in her role. Here’s what to know about Erika McEntarfer: McEntarfer, whose research focuses on job loss, retirement, worker mobility, and wage rigidity, had previously worked at the Census Bureau’s Center for Economic Studies, the Treasury Department’s Office of Tax Policy and the White House Council of Economic Advisers in a nonpolitical role. She has a bachelor's degree in Social Science from Bard College and a doctoral degree in economics from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. McEntarfer was nominated in 2023 to serve as BLS head, and the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions recommended that her nomination go to the full Senate for a vote. She was confirmed as BLS commissioner in January 2024 on a bipartisan 86-8 Senate vote. Among the Republican senators who voted to confirm her included then-Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, who is now Trump's vice president, and then-Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who is now Trump's secretary of state. Before her confirmation hearing, a group called the Friends of the BLS, made up of former commissioners who served in both Democratic and Republican administrations, members of statistical associations and credentialed economists, said McEntarfer's background made her a great choice for the job. “The many reasons to quickly confirm Dr. McEntarfer as the new BLS Commissioner all boil down to this: the agency, like the entire statistical system, is undergoing an intense, significant period of change and Dr. McEntarfer’s wealth of research and statistical experience have equipped her to be the strong leader that BLS needs to meet these challenges,” Friends of the BLS wrote. William Beach, who was appointed BLS commissioner in 2019 by Trump and served until 2023 during President Joe Biden's administration, called McEntarfer's firing “groundless” and said in an X post that it “sets a dangerous precedent and undermines the statistical mission of the Bureau.” Former Labor Department chief economist Sarah J. Glynn, who received regular briefings from McEntarfer about BLS findings, said McEntarfer was generous with her time explaining what conclusions could or couldn’t be reached from the data. If the data didn’t support something an administration official was saying, McEntarfer would say so, Glynn said. She also never weighed in on how the administration should present or interpret the data, Glynn said — she would simply answer questions about the data. “She had a sterling reputation as someone who is concerned about the accuracy of the data and not someone who puts a political spin on her work,” Glynn said. Heather Boushey, a senior research fellow at Harvard University, served with McEntarfer on the White House Council of Economic Advisers and said McEntarfer never talked politics at work. “She showed up every day to focus on the best analysis and the best approach to her field and not get political. That is what I saw from her time and again. She is brilliant and well-respected among labor economists generally,” Boushey said. “She wasn’t coming into my office to talk politics or the political implications of something. She definitely wasn’t engaging on that side of things.” ___ Olson reported from New York. Associated Press writer Christopher Rugaber in Washington contributed to this report.

"American Eagle responds to critics over ad with Sydney Sweeney, saying it was always about the jeans",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/american-eagle-responds-to-critics-over-ad-with-sydney-sweeney-saying-it-was-always-about-the-jeans-2025-08-01/,"NEW YORK (AP) — Teen retailer American Eagle Outfitters has a message to its critics, who took issue over its denim ad campaign with 27-year-old actor Sydney Sweeney that sparked a debate over race and Western beauty standards. The campaign, the retailer said, was always about the jeans. In a statement posted on American Eagle's Instagram account on Friday, the retailer said the ad campaign “is and always was about the jeans. Her jeans. Her story. We'll continue to celebrate how everyone wears their AE jeans with confidence, their way. Great jeans look good on everyone.” The message marked the first time the teen retailer responded to days of backlash since the ad with the tagline “Sydney Sweeney has great jeans” launched last week. In the run-up to the ad blitz, the company's chief marketing officer told trade media outlets that it included “clever, even provocative language” and was “definitely going to push buttons."" It's unclear if the company knew how much controversy the ad could raise. Most of the negative reception focused on videos that used the word “genes” instead of “jeans” when discussing the blonde-haired, blue-eyed actor known for the HBO series “Euphoria” and “White Lotus.” Critics found the most troubling was a teaser video in which Sweeney says, “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color. My jeans are blue.” The video appeared on American Eagle’s Facebook page and other social media channels but is not part of the ad campaign. Some critics saw the wordplay as a nod, either unintentional or deliberate, to eugenics, a discredited theory that held humanity could be improved through selective breeding for certain traits. Other commenters accused detractors of reading too much into the campaign’s message. Some marketing experts said the buzz is always good even if it’s not uniformly positive. “If you try to follow all the rules, you’ll make lots of people happy, but you’ll fail,” Allen Adamson, co-founder of marketing consultancy Metaforce said. “The rocket won’t take off.” Before you consider Meta Platforms, you'll want to hear this.

"Columbia Sportswear sues Columbia University, alleging merchandise too similar and causes confusion",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/columbia-sportswear-sues-columbia-university-alleging-merchandise-too-similar-and-causes-confusion-2025-08-01/,"NEW YORK (AP) — Outerwear retailer Columbia Sportswear has sued Columbia University over alleged trademark infringement and a breach of contract, saying that the university’s merchandise looks too similar to its own offerings and can confuse shoppers. In a lawsuit filed July 23 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon, Columbia Sportswear, whose roots date back to 1938, alleges that the Ivy League university intentionally violated an agreement the parties signed on June 13, 2023. That agreement dictated how the university could use the word “Columbia” on its own apparel and accessories. As part of the pact, the university could feature “Columbia” on its merchandise provided that the name included a recognizable school insignia or its mascot, the word “university,” the name of the academic department or the founding year of the university — 1754 — or a combination. Columbia Sportswear clothing is sold at more than 800 retail locations including more than 150 of its branded stores as well as its website and third-party marketplaces. But Columbia Sportswear alleges the university breached the agreement a little more than a year later, with the Portland, Oregon-based company noticing several garments without any of the school logos being sold at the Columbia University online store. Many of the garments feature a bright blue color that is “confusingly similar” to the blue color that has long been associated with Columbia Sportswear, the suit alleged. The lawsuit offered photos of some of the Columbia University items that say only Columbia. “The likelihood of deception, confusion, and mistake engendered by the university’s misappropriation and misuse of the Columbia name is causing irreparable harm to the brand and goodwill symbolized by Columbia Sportswear’s registered mark Columbia and the reputation for quality it embodies,” the lawsuit alleged. The lawsuit comes at a time when Columbia University has been threatened with the potential loss of billions of dollars in government support. Last week, Columbia University reached a deal with the Trump administration to pay more than $220 million to the federal government to restore federal research money that was canceled in the name of combating antisemitism on campus. Under the agreement, the Ivy League school will pay a $200 million settlement over three years, the university said. Columbia Sportswear aims to stop all sales of clothing that violate the agreement, recall any products already sold and donate any remaining merchandise to charity. Columbia Sportswear is also seeking three times the amount of actual damages determined by a jury. Neither Columbia Sportswear nor Columbia University could be immediately reached for comment.
