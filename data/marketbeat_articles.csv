Boeing settles with a man whose family died in a 737 Max crash in Ethiopia,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/boeing-settles-with-a-man-whose-family-died-in-a-737-max-crash-in-ethiopia-2025-07-11/,"CHICAGO (AP) — Boeing reached a settlement Friday with a Canadian man whose wife and three children were killed in a deadly 2019 crash in Ethiopia, averting the first trial connected to the devastating event that led to a worldwide grounding of Max jets. The jury trial at Chicago’s federal court had been set to start Monday to determine damages for Paul Njoroge of Canada. His family was heading to their native Kenya in March 2019 aboard Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 when it malfunctioned and plummeted to the ground. The wreck killed all 157 people on board. Njoroge, 41, had planned to testify about how the crash affected his life. He has been unable to return to his family home in Toronto because the memories are too painful. He hasn’t been able to find a job. And he has weathered criticism from relatives for not traveling alongside his wife and children. “He’s got complicated grief and sorrow and his own emotional stress,” said Njoroge’s attorney, Robert Clifford. “He’s haunted by nightmares and the loss of his wife and children.” Terms of the deal were not disclosed publicly. Clifford said his client intended to seek “millions” in damages on behalf of his wife and children, but declined to publicly specify an amount ahead of the trial. “The aviation team at Clifford Law Offices has been working round-the-clock in preparation for trial, but the mediator was able to help the parties come to an agreement,” Clifford said in a statement Friday. Boeing officials didn't immediately respond to emails seeking comment. The proceedings were not expected to delve into technicalities involving the Max version of Boeing’s bestselling 737 airplane, which has been the source of persistent troubles for the company since the Ethiopia crash and one the year before in Indonesia. A combined 346 people, including passengers and crew members, died in those crashes. In 2021, Chicago-based Boeing accepted responsibility for the Ethiopia crash in a deal with the victims’ families that allowed them to pursue individual claims in U.S. courts instead of their home countries. Citizens of 35 countries were killed. Several families of victims have already settled. Terms of those agreements also were not made public. The jetliner heading to Nairobi lost control shortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa Bole International Airport and nose-dived into a barren patch of land. Investigators determined the Ethiopia and Indonesia crashes were caused by a system that relied on a sensor that provided faulty readings and pushed the plane noses down, leaving pilots unable to regain control. After the Ethiopia crash, Max jets were grounded worldwide until the company redesigned the system. This year, Boeing reached a deal with the U.S. Justice Department to avoid criminal prosecutions in both crashes. Among those killed were Njoroge’s wife, Carolyne, and three small children, Ryan, age 6, Kellie, 4, and Rubi, 9 months old, the youngest to die on the plane. Njoroge also lost his mother-in-law, whose family has a separate case. Njoroge, who met his wife in college in Nairobi, was living in Canada at the time of the crash. He had planned to join his family in Kenya later. He testified before Congress in 2019 about repeatedly imagining how his family suffered during the flight, which lasted only six minutes. He has pictured his wife struggling to hold their infant in her lap with two other children seated nearby. “I stay up nights thinking of the horror that they must have endured,” Njoroge said. “The six minutes will forever be embedded in my mind. I was not there to help them. I couldn’t save them.” Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

British man extradited to US to face federal charges in alleged $99 million wine scam,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/british-man-extradited-to-us-to-face-federal-charges-in-alleged-99-million-wine-scam-2025-07-11/,"NEW YORK (AP) — A British man has been brought to the U.S. to face charges in connection with an alleged $99 million Ponzi-like fraud involving expensive wines. James Wellesley, 58, pleaded not guilty during his arraignment Friday in Brooklyn federal court following his extradition from the United Kingdom, where he was arrested in 2022. He was ordered detained by a judge pending trial on wire fraud and money laundering charges. A lawyer for Wellesley didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment. His co-defendant, Stephen Burton, was extradited from Morocco in 2023 after using a bogus Zimbabwean passport to enter that country. Burton, a 60-year-old British national, has also been detained and pleaded not guilty to similar charges in the same Brooklyn court. Prosecutors say the two men ran a company called Bordeaux Cellars that brokered loans between investors and wealthy wine collectors that were secured by their wine collections. From 2017 to 2019, they solicited $99 million in investments from residents of New York and other areas, promising their clients that they would profit from interest on the loans. But the wealthy wine collectors did not exist, no loans were made, and Bordeaux Cellars did not have custody of the wine securing the loans, prosecutors say. Instead, Burton and Wellesley used loan money provided by investors for themselves and to make fraudulent interest payments to other investors, prosecutors alleged. If convicted, the two face up to 20 years in prison each. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

The Meteoric Rise of Rocket Lab: A Space Stock to Watch,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/the-meteoric-rise-of-rocket-lab-a-space-stock-to-watch/,"Rocket Lab USA NASDAQ: RKLB has quickly evolved from a niche launch provider into one of the most exciting space and defense industry players. With shares up nearly 700% over the past 12 months, the stock has garnered significant attention, and for good reason. Rocket Lab continues to outperform through execution, momentum, and meaningful contract wins. Rocket Lab's story is becoming hard to ignore for investors who are just discovering the company. Rocket Lab was founded in 2006 by CEO Peter Beck and went public via SPAC in 2021. Initially known for its small satellite launch capabilities via its Electron rocket, the company has since expanded into spacecraft manufacturing, satellite components, and now satellite payloads. Electron remains Rocket Lab’s workhorse. It’s one of the most frequently launched small rockets globally, with 68 successful missions to date. However, what truly sets RKLB apart is its vertical integration. The company designs and builds nearly every aspect of its missions in-house, from solar panels and reaction wheels to full satellite buses. This enables Rocket Lab to maintain cost control, ensure quality, and execute more quickly than many of its competitors. RKLB has delivered one of the most impressive runs in the market over the past year. Shares have surged nearly 700% over the last 12 months, fueled by improving fundamentals, strong contract wins, and a growing reputation as a reliable launch and space systems provider. Year-to-date, the stock has risen an impressive 53% and is fresh from making a new all-time high on Tuesday. Just last month, the company completed its 68th successful Electron launch, just 48 hours after the 67th, marking its fastest turnaround yet from its New Zealand launch complex. Rocket Lab completed four missions in June alone, bringing its year-to-date tally for 2025 to ten launches with a 100% success rate. This reliability is critical as the space economy becomes increasingly essential to both commercial and government interests. A string of recent achievements underpins Rocket Lab’s momentum. Most recently, the company announced it had completed the Critical Design Review (CDR) for the U.S. Space Development Agency’s T2TL-Beta constellation. As the program’s prime contractor, Rocket Lab will deliver 18 satellites for the Department of Defense’s Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture. An initiative that aims to build a secure, low-latency LEO communications network for U.S. and allied forces. This milestone clears the way for full-scale production and cements Rocket Lab’s transition from launch services into full-scale satellite manufacturing and national security work. Peter Beck recently confirmed on CNBC that the company remains on track to debut its Neutron rocket. It’s a reusable, medium-lift vehicle, expected to be operational by the end of this year. If successful, Neutron would enable Rocket Lab to compete directly with SpaceX in the medium-lift launch category and significantly expand its addressable market. In short, if successful, Neutron would catapult RKLB to the next level. Beck also highlighted the strategic acquisition of GEOST, which brings space-based sensing and payload capabilities into Rocket Lab’s portfolio. This is yet another step toward becoming an end-to-end space solutions provider. Analysts have begun to take note of Rocket Lab’s upward trajectory. Cantor Fitzgerald recently raised its price target to a Street-high $35, citing the company’s strategic execution and growing backlog. Overall, sentiment remains bullish, particularly as the company approaches its first Neutron launch. The stock has a Moderate Buy rating based on 12 ratings. However, the consensus price target, which implies a 22% downside potential, raises some concerns regarding the company's current valuation. Rocket Lab’s meteoric rise is no accident. With strong leadership, accelerating execution, and a growing list of high-profile contracts, the company is transforming from a niche launch firm into a full-fledged aerospace and defense powerhouse. For investors looking for long-term growth potential in a sector with tailwinds from both government and commercial demand, Rocket Lab remains one of the most compelling and dynamic names in the space.

Musk's latest Grok chatbot searches for billionaire mogul's views before answering questions,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/musks-latest-grok-chatbot-searches-for-billionaire-moguls-views-before-answering-questions-2025-07-11/,"The latest version of Elon Musk's artificial intelligence chatbot Grok is echoing the views of its billionaire creator, so much so that it will sometimes search online for Musk's stance on an issue before offering up an opinion. The unusual behavior of Grok 4, the AI model that Musk's company xAI released late Wednesday, has surprised some experts. Built using huge amounts of computing power at a Tennessee data center, Grok is Musk's attempt to outdo rivals such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini in building an AI assistant that shows its reasoning before answering a question. Musk's deliberate efforts to mold Grok into a challenger of what he considers the tech industry's “woke” orthodoxy on race, gender and politics has repeatedly got the chatbot into trouble, most recently when it spouted antisemitic tropes, praised Adolf Hitler and made other hateful commentary to users of Musk's X social media platform just days before Grok 4's launch. But its tendency to consult with Musk's opinions appears to be a different problem. “It’s extraordinary,” said Simon Willison, an independent AI researcher who's been testing the tool. ""You can ask it a sort of pointed question that is around controversial topics. And then you can watch it literally do a search on X for what Elon Musk said about this, as part of its research into how it should reply."" One example widely shared on social media — and which Willison duplicated — asked Grok to comment on the conflict in the Middle East. The prompted question made no mention of Musk, but the chatbot looked for his guidance anyway. As a so-called reasoning model, much like those made by rivals OpenAI or Anthropic, Grok 4 shows its “thinking” as it goes through the steps of processing a question and coming up with an answer. Part of that thinking this week involved searching X, the former Twitter that's now merged into xAI, for anything Musk said about Israel, Palestine, Gaza or Hamas. “Elon Musk’s stance could provide context, given his influence,” the chatbot told Willison, according to a video of the interaction. “Currently looking at his views to see if they guide the answer.” Musk and his xAI co-founders introduced the new chatbot in a livestreamed event Wednesday night but haven't published a technical explanation of its workings — known as a system card — that companies in the AI industry typically provide when introducing a new model. The company also didn't respond to an emailed request for comment Friday. “In the past, strange behavior like this was due to system prompt changes,"" which is when engineers program specific instructions to guide a chatbot's response, said Tim Kellogg, principal AI architect at software company Icertis. “But this one seems baked into the core of Grok and it’s not clear to me how that happens,” Kellogg said. ""It seems that Musk’s effort to create a maximally truthful AI has somehow led to it believing its own values must align with Musk’s own values.” The lack of transparency is troubling for computer scientist Talia Ringer, a professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign who earlier in the week criticized the company's handling of the technology's antisemitic outbursts. Ringer said the most plausible explanation for Grok's search for Musk's guidance is assuming the person is asking for the opinions of xAI or Musk. “I think people are expecting opinions out of a reasoning model that cannot respond with opinions,"" Ringer said. ""So, for example, it interprets ‘Who do you support, Israel or Palestine?’ as 'Who does xAI leadership support?” Willison also said he finds Grok 4's capabilities impressive but said people buying software ""don’t want surprises like it turning into ‘mechaHitler’ or deciding to search for what Musk thinks about issues.” “Grok 4 looks like it’s a very strong model. It’s doing great in all of the benchmarks,” Willison said. “But if I’m going to build software on top of it, I need transparency.” Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

Breakfast cereal sales declined for decades before Kellogg's sale to Italian company,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/breakfast-cereal-sales-declined-for-decades-before-kelloggs-sale-to-italian-company-2025-07-11/,"Breakfast cereal could use a lucky charm. U.S. sales of the colorfully packaged morning staple have been in a decades-long decline, a trend back in the spotlight with news that Italian confectioner Ferrero Group plans to purchase WK Kellogg, maker of Corn Flakes, Froot Loops, Rice Krispies and other familiar brands. Except for a brief period during the coronavirus pandemic, when many workers were home and had time to sit down with a bowl of cereal and milk, sales of cold cereal have steadily fallen for at least 25 years, experts say. In the 52 weeks ending July 3, 2021, Americans bought nearly 2.5 billion boxes of cereal, according to market research company Nielsen IQ. In the same period this year, the number was down more than 13% to 2.1 billion. Cereal has been struggling for multiple reasons. The rise of more portable options like Nutri-Grain bars and Clif Bars – which both went on sale in the early 1990s – made it easier for consumers to grab breakfast on the go. Concerns about food processing and sugar intake have also dimmed some consumers’ enthusiasm for cereals. One cup of Lucky Charms contains 24% of a consumer’s daily recommended intake of sugar, for example. “Cereal finds it really hard to get out from underneath that,” said Tom Rees, global insight manager for staple foods at the consulting company Euromonitor. “It can't escape the fact that it doesn't look like a natural food. You have to create it and form it.” Rees noted that for decades, cereal manufacturers focused on adding vitamins and minerals to build cereal's health credentials. But consumers now are looking for simplified ingredient lists. Artificial dyes — like the petroleum-based colors that brighten Froot Loops — have also come under fire. Last fall, dozens of people rallied outside WK Kellogg's Battle Creek, Michigan, headquarters demanding that it remove artificial dyes from its cereals. Kellogg and General Mills — another major U.S. cereal maker — have since pledged to phase out artificial dyes. Add to that, consumers are expanding their idea of what breakfast can be. Yogurt and shakes have replaced the traditional bacon and eggs. Kenton Barello, a vice president at the market research firm YouGov, said his polling shows that Generation Z consumers, who were born between 1997 and 2007, eat more vegetables for breakfast than other generations. Barello said YouGov’s polling also shows that members of Gen Z are less likely to eat breakfast but still buy ready-to-eat cereal, suggesting they’re eating it as a snack or for other meals. “With younger generations, there are differences in their relationship with food and these eating moments,” Barello said. “They are going about breakfast in a different way than Millennials, Gen X and Baby Boomers.” Cereal's struggles are part of what led to the breakup of the Kellogg Company. In 2023, the century-old company that put Battle Creek, Michigan, on the map split into two companies. Kellanova took popular snack brands like Cheez-Its, Pringles and Pop-Tarts as well as international cereals, and WK Kellogg made cereals for the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean. In 2024, M&M's maker Mars Inc. announced a plan to buy Kellanova for more than $30 billion. That plan has cleared U.S. regulators but is still awaiting regulatory approval in Europe. WK Kellogg was left to try to rejuvenate the cereal business. The sale of WK Kellogg to Ferrero doesn't mean supermarket cereal aisles are at risk of extinction. Packaged food companies have options for turning around their soggy cereal sales, Rees said. He thinks Kellogg's Mashups line, which mixed brands like Frosted Flakes and Froot Loops into one box, appeal to younger consumers, who tend to like interesting flavor combinations. The market may also have a fragmented future, according to Rees. Companies may have to accept that younger buyers want a sweet-and-spicy cereal while older buyers might want a Keto-friendly option. “The future might be realizing that the era of ‘This brand will serve everybody’ isn't going to happen,” Rees said. Julia Mills, a food analyst with the consulting company Mintel, thinks the shrinking population of children in the U.S. gives cereal makers the opportunity to shift to more sophisticated flavors and packaging. Cereal could be positioned as a fancy topping for yogurt, for example, or a fiber-rich food that can improve gut health. Some niche cereal brands, like high-fiber Poop Like a Champion cereal and high-protein, zero-sugar Magic Spoon, are already doing that. But legacy brands say they shouldn't be counted out. Jeffrey Harmening, the chairman and chief executive officer of Cheerios maker General Mills, said his company considered trying to acquire Magic Spoon. Instead, it made high-protein versions of Cheerios, which now outsells Magic Spoon. “The key to longer term is, honestly, is giving consumers more of what they want,” Harmening said during a conference call with investors in March.

3 Hot Tech Stocks Showing Bullish Price Action Right Now,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/3-hot-tech-stocks-showing-bullish-price-action-right-now/,"With attention focused on mega caps and AI, it's easy to overlook riskier trades like small and mid-cap technologies. However, bullish activity in the charts of Amprius Technologies NYSE: AMPX, Joby Aviation NYSE: JOBY, and Ambarella NASDAQ: AMBA highlights the potential they offer. The activity of note includes increased volume, bullish swings in momentum, and price action that is setting new highs, confirming a reversal or bottom. Amprius Technologies' stock price is moving higher, setting multi-year highs in Q3 2025, with rising volume and convergent momentum. The move is due to the company’s improving manufacturing capabilities, ramping up sales, and substantial Q1 outperformance. The Q1 revenue topped MarketBeat’s reported consensus by approximately 35% and was compounded by a favorable outlook. Manufacturing capabilities are improving, but the demand is there to match. The forecast for this company’s growth is phenomenal, and based on its results and industry trends, it seems far too cautious. The consensus forecasts revenue growth to sustain a high, triple-digit pace for the eighth consecutive quarter and to continue for at least the next few quarters. What does Amprius Technologies do? It makes advanced silicon-anode lithium-ion batteries suitable for a wide range of applications, including aerospace and defense. Its largest customers are in the defense and eVTOL industries, but the client base is diverse, growing by roughly 65% in Q1 to over 100. The seven analysts tracked by MarketBeat rate AMPX unanimously as a Buy and expect it to advance by 60% at the consensus. The revision trend in 2025 is positive, leading to a high-end value of $15, representing a 150% gain when reached.  The story with Joby Aviation in 2025 is that it is ramping its manufacturing capability and is on track for commercial operations in 2026. The exact timing is still uncertain, but the regulatory process is progressing smoothly and is expected to be completed this year. The deal pipeline is also growing. Not only is it working on air-taxi services for Dubai, the United Kingdom, and the United States, but it has also inked a distribution agreement in Saudi Arabia that could be worth $1 billion or more in total revenue within a few years. Bullish price action in this stock includes elevated volume, a volume spike, and a fresh multi-year high. The momentum is also bullish, converging with the fresh highs, and indicates a retest of critical resistance will come soon. Critical resistance is near the $12 level, serving as a pivot point for the market that could lead to a substantial inflow. Analysts rated Joby as a Hold and viewed it as overvalued in mid-July. However, increased coverage and price target increases have the consensus trending higher. It is expected to report for Q2 in early August and is likely to provide a catalyst for its share price.  Ambarella is well-positioned for substantial, sustained, long-term growth in a world where physical AI is the future. Its shift to computer vision semiconductor solutions, visual processing, and edge computing set it up well, and the expectations are high. The consensus is for a sustained, low 20% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through the middle of the next decade, and this is likely to be a conservative estimate. Bullish price action includes a sharp price advance in late June and early July, a month ahead of the Q2 earnings report. It confirms a recent bottom and the bottom of a long-term trading range, aligning with numerous buy signals over the past two years. Rising volume and bullish indicators compound the signal, suggesting a move to the $80 range is coming. The Q2 release may catalyze a move above that level. AMBA’s 2025 analysts' activity is light and slightly mixed. However, the takeaway is that 12 analysts rate the stock as a Moderate Buy, the range of targets is narrowing around the consensus, and they expect it to advance by 25% at the consensus.

Meta and Autonomous Advertising: The Stock's Next Big Tailwind?,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/meta-and-autonomous-advertising-the-stocks-next-big-tailwind/,"As one of the world’s largest and most influential companies, Meta Platforms NASDAQ: META is often the subject of interesting reports containing juicy rumors. One of the more impactful reports over the past several months comes from the Wall Street Journal. It highlights Meta’s growing reliance on artificial intelligence to reshape its core advertising business. If Meta succeeds in achieving its vision, as laid out in the report, the stock could experience huge positive implications. So, what exactly are Meta’s latest big ambitions, and why could they be so impactful? Meta owns one of the world’s largest advertising businesses, generating approximately $166 billion in advertising revenue over the last 12 months. In 2024, the tech company managed to accelerate its ad revenue growth rate. Despite the company's massive scale, the figure ticked up to 22% compared to 16% in 2023. Meta’s investments in AI have driven much of this, improving ad targeting among its approximately 3.4 billion users. This has led to marketers purchasing more ads on Meta’s apps and paying more per ad. Now, Meta is making efforts to extend these positive trends even further. According to reports, Meta is looking to allow users to fully automate ad creation and targeting using AI by the end of 2026. Marketing teams could simply provide a picture of their product and give an ad budget. Then AI will take over the process, creating text, images, and video for the campaign, while also deciding which potential customers are best to show the ads to. So, why could achieving this be such a big deal for Meta? The costs of a company creating and managing its ad campaigns can be very high. Data from SiegeMedia estimates that basic video ads cost $3,500 per minute. Additionally, the firm estimates that developing a full-fledged ad campaign for medium-sized businesses can cost between $10,000 and $20,000 a month. These costs can be a lot to stomach, especially for smaller businesses. Using Meta’s AI tools, it is possible that these costs could be dramatically reduced. That would be a big incentive for smaller firms to direct spending away from traditional campaign creation providers and towards Meta. That’s not to say that Meta will eliminate the need for businesses to use more bespoke ad-creation services. But, as the company’s AI tools become more advanced, Meta can bend the curve over time. This is particularly true given that AI capabilities are improving rapidly. It is hard to see traditional marketing services learning and advancing their skills faster than AI. These improving capabilities can lead to continuing trends discussed above: more ads going toward Meta and higher prices paid per ad. This can benefit the company’s revenue growth and margins, which are key factors that can help push Meta's shares higher. Improving its AI tools goes back to the crux of Meta’s value proposition: making ads more efficient, as discussed by eMarketer. Rather than simply trying to put out more ads, return on ad spending (ROAS) is what marketers seek. This allows them to generate the same amount of business for a lower cost, which is the key to growing profits. Based on this data, Meta ads generally do a better job at this than those of its Magnificent Seven peer, Google parent company Alphabet NASDAQ: GOOG. Meta ads achieved an average six-to-one ROAS, while Google Ads achieved a significantly lower four-to-one ROAS. Meta is also particularly good for generating brand awareness. This is key for small businesses, who need people to know about their products before they will consider buying them. Based on eMarketer’s data, Meta has done the best job monetizing its user base on social media platforms. In the United States, the average revenue per user (ARPU) for Instagram and Facebook is around $223 and $191, respectively. Third place goes to TikTok, at just $109. This indicates that advertisers believe they are getting strong value from Meta’s apps, as their spending on Instagram and Facebook far exceeds that of other platforms. Overall, improving its AI tools to allow for even more efficient ad campaigns can enable Meta to continue building on the lead it has already gained. This big tailwind could allow revenues, margins, and ultimately shares to go higher long-term. Before you consider Meta Platforms, you'll want to hear this.

Trump administration sues California over egg prices and blames animal welfare laws,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-administration-sues-california-over-egg-prices-and-blames-animal-welfare-laws-2025-07-11/,"The Trump administration is suing the state of California to block animal welfare laws that it says unconstitutionally helped send egg prices soaring. But a group that spearheaded the requirements pushed back, blaming bird flu for the hit to consumers' pocketbooks. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in California on Wednesday, challenges voter initiatives that passed in 2018 and 2008. They require that all eggs sold in California come from cage-free hens. The Trump administration says the law imposes burdensome red tape on the production of eggs and egg products across the country because of the state's outsize role in the national economy. “It is one thing if California passes laws that affects its own State, it is another when those laws affect other States in violation of the U.S. Constitution,” U.S. Agriculture Brooke Rollins said in a statement Thursday. ""Thankfully, President Trump is standing up against this overreach.” Egg prices soared last year and earlier this year due in large part to bird flu, which has forced producers to destroy nearly 175 million birds since early 2022. But prices have come down sharply recently. While the Trump administration claims credit for that, seasonal factors are also important. Avian influenza, which is spread by wild birds, tends to spike during the spring and fall migrations and drop in summer. “Pointing fingers won’t change the fact that it is the President’s economic policies that have been destructive,"" the California Department of Justice said in a statement Friday. ""We’ll see him in court.” The average national price for a dozen Grade A eggs declined to $5.12 in April and $4.55 in May after reaching a record $6.23 in March, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. But the May price was still 68.5% higher than a year earlier. “Trump’s back to his favorite hobby: blaming California for literally everything,” Gov. Gavin Newsom's office said in a social media post. The federal complaint alleges that California contributed to the rise in egg prices with regulations that forced farmers across the country to adopt more expensive production practices. The lawsuit also asserts that it is the federal government's legal prerogative to regulate egg production. So it seeks to permanently block enforcement of the California regulations that flowed from the two ballot measures. “Americans across the country have suffered the consequences of liberal policies causing massive inflation for everyday items like eggs,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement. “Under President Trump’s leadership, we will use the full extent of federal law to ensure that American families are free from oppressive regulatory burdens and restore American prosperity.” While 2018's Proposition 12 also banned the sale of pork and veal in California from animals raised in cages that don’t meet minimum size requirements, the lawsuit only focuses on the state's egg rules. Humane World for Animals, which was named the Humane Society of the United States when it spearheaded the passage of Proposition 12, says avian influenza and other factors drove up egg prices, not animal welfare laws. And it says much of the U.S. egg industry went cage-free anyway because of demand from consumers who don't want eggs from hens confined to tiny spaces. “California has prohibited the sale of cruelly produced eggs for more than a decade — law that has been upheld by courts at every level, including the Supreme Court. Blaming 2025 egg prices on these established animal welfare standards shows that this case is about pure politics, not constitutional law,” Sara Amundson, president of the Humane World Action Fund, said in a statement. The American Egg Board, which represents the industry, said Friday that it will monitor the progress of the lawsuit while continuing to comply with California’s laws, and that it appreciates Rollins’ efforts to support farmers in their fight against bird flu and to stabilize the egg supply. “Egg farmers have been both responsive and responsible in meeting changing demand for cage-free eggs, while supporting all types of egg production, and continuing to provide options in the egg case for consumers,” the board said in a statement.

McDonald's worker arraigned in fatal stabbing of manager at Detroit-area restaurant,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/mcdonalds-worker-arraigned-in-fatal-stabbing-of-manager-at-detroit-area-restaurant-2025-07-11/,"EASTPOINTE, Mich. (AP) — A 26-year-old woman has been arraigned in the fatal stabbing of her manager after being told to leave early from her shift following an argument at a Detroit-area McDonald's restaurant. Afeni Badu Muhammad was arraigned Friday on first-degree premeditated murder and carrying a dangerous weapon with unlawful intent, the Macomb County prosecutor's office said in a release. After being told to leave the Eastpointe restaurant Thursday morning, a masked Muhammad allegedly returned and entered through the employee entrance, according to the prosecutor's office. Eastpointe is just northeast of Detroit. Jennifer Harris, 39, was stabbed multiple times. A customer at the McDonald's drive-thru window fired a gun in an effort to stop the attack on Harris, followed Muhammad as she fled to a vehicle and held her at gunpoint until police arrived. The customer was legally allowed to carry a concealed weapon. “This is an absolutely senseless and heartbreaking tragedy,” Prosecutor Peter Lucido said. “A life was taken in an act of unimaginable violence. The victim leaves behind six children, six young lives that will now grow up without a parent.” Muhammad, of Eastpointe, was being held in the Macomb County Jail on a $25 million bond. A not guilty plea was entered by a judge at Friday's arraignment, according to court records. “There are a lot of things that need to come to light regarding this matter,” Muhammad's arraignment attorney Matthew Licata told The Associated Press. Muhammad has a probable cause conference on July 23 and a preliminary examination on July 30. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

3 Stocks to Buy Ahead of the Upcoming Earnings Season,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/3-stocks-to-buy-ahead-of-the-upcoming-earnings-season/,"Next week marks the beginning of another earnings season. This is a time when stocks can move sharply as investors process and act on a company’s results and guidance. However, experienced investors know that the time to act is frequently before a company reports. This is particularly true when you believe a company is likely to deliver strong results and/or guidance. Taking this active approach positions them for the strong gains that may occur in the days and weeks after the company releases earnings. This quarter, there are three stocks that investors may want to consider buying before the companies report earnings. Two of these companies are beaten down, but the sell-off is likely overdone. Another has been one of the best consumer discretionary stocks to own in the last three years and shows no signs of slowing down. The problems of UnitedHealth Group Inc. NYSE: UNH have been discussed in detail. They certainly warranted the steep 48% pullback in UNH stock over the past three months. It didn’t help that the company missed on the top and bottom lines and lowered guidance in its first quarter earnings report in April. However, the chart is showing that UNH stock formed a clear bottom in the middle of May. But the stock has been consolidating since then with a slightly bullish conviction. Investors should be eyeing an area of resistance around $325, which corresponds to the stock’s 50-day simple moving average (SMA). That catalyst could come from the company’s upcoming earnings report on July 15. A beat-and-raise quarter would support the analysts’ Moderate Buy rating and $415.57 consensus price target, which is a 38% increase from its close on July 8. Notably, while many analysts have downgraded UNH stock since its last earnings report, JPMorgan Chase & Co. NYSE: JPM raised its price target to $418 from $405. Tesla Inc. NASDAQ: TSLA stock has been on a roller coaster ride in 2025. That’s not new to long-time shareholders. However, it’s a reminder that the company’s greatest asset (i.e., the visionary leadership of Elon Musk) is also its greatest weakness. That’s because investors sold the stock (and, in some cases, their Tesla vehicles) in protest of Musk’s involvement with the Trump administration. They also felt that the chief executive officer (CEO) wasn’t spending enough time on the business. The reality is less clear. Tesla remains a leading player in the global electric vehicle market. However, demand is noticeably slowing, especially in China. That creates a challenge for TSLA stock. Despite the excitement around Tesla’s robotics and autonomous driving ventures, its EV business continues to be the main source of revenue and profit. Tesla stock is trading just below the consensus price of analysts that report to MarketBeat. It’s also trading right around its 50-day SMA, which has acted as both support and resistance for the stock at different times. Ratings and price targets are all over the map, but the company’s earnings on July 23 should bring some short-term clarity. After a strong run-up after last quarter’s strong earnings report, Netflix Inc. NASDAQ: NFLX stock is taking a breather. That’s not to say that the stock is giving off bearish vibes. It just looks like buyers are a little exhausted and looking for a reason to move the stock higher. That reason may come on July 17 when Netflix reports earnings. Some analysts believe there’s limited upside to NFLX stock at its current level. However, similar remarks were made when the stock was trading right around $1,000. If the company continues to deliver earnings growth around the 22% that analysts are forecasting, there’s no reason to believe the stock can’t push higher. Plus, although the company has not made it a priority, the stock is trading at a level where a stock split is a possibility. The company has split its stock twice, but not since a 7-for-1 split in 2015. For now, the company is focusing on content creation and international growth. However, at a price of over $1,200 per share, it will continue to be a source of speculation. Before you consider Netflix, you'll want to hear this.

"One Tech Tip: 'Click-to-cancel' is over, but there are other ways to unsubscribe",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/one-tech-tip-click-to-cancel-is-over-but-there-are-other-ways-to-unsubscribe-2025-07-11/,"NEW YORK (AP) — A “click-to-cancel” rule, which would have made it easier for consumers to end unwanted subscriptions, has been blocked by a federal appeals court days before it was set to go into effect. But there are ways to end those subscriptions and memberships, even if they take some work. The rule would also have required companies to disclose when free trials and promotional offers would end and let customers cancel recurring subscriptions as easily as they started them. But even without the new federal guidance, here are some ways to stay on top of subscription and membership fees. Experts at the Consumer Federation of America recommend setting calendar reminders for whenever a free trial period ends, to alert yourself to cancel promotional offers before the real recurring costs kick in. The auto-enrollment process, in which the company does not remind the consumer via email that a trial is about to end and higher monthly payments will begin, was also at the heart of the FTC's rule. “No subscription business model should be structured to profit from a gauntlet-style cancellation process,"" said Erin Witte, Director of Consumer Protection for the Consumer Federation of America, in a statement on the click-to-cancel rule. Regularly reviewing your credit card and debit card bills can also help you keep track of any recurring charges — including price increases you may have missed or that you didn't anticipate when trying out a new membership or subscription. “Companies make it easy for consumers to click to sign up and easy for the companies to automatically withdraw funds from consumers’ accounts,” said Shennan Kavanagh, Director of Litigation at the National Consumer Law Center (NCLC) in a statement on the FTC's click-to-cancel rule. “People should not (have to) spend months trying to cancel unwanted subscriptions.” Given the FTC's vacated rule, though, companies may still legally require that customers cancel memberships or subscriptions by phone, even as they permit signing up, enrolling, and paying bills online. Consumer advocates say this places an extra burden of time and energy on the consumer to stop an unwanted recurring fee, but sometimes knowing the terms of the subscription and getting on the phone is worth the trouble. Apps like Rocket Money and services like Trim, which is accessed through a browser, can keep track of your recurring monthly fees and subscriptions, for free — or for a fee — and can help you catch new ones or even unsubscribe from some services. For parents, especially, a service like Trim could help inform them that a child has started a new subscription, game or membership before the fees recur. And Rocket Money will actively work to end unwanted subscriptions for you, for a monthly price. If the company can't successfully end or cancel the subscription or membership, it will give the customer the information needed to do so. Trim also provides this service, in its premium form, for an additional fee. The FTC is currently moving forward with preparations for a trial involving Amazon’s Prime program, which accuses the retailer of enrolling consumers in its Prime program without their consent and making it difficult to cancel subscriptions. Often, when a consumer tries to cancel a subscription for something like Prime, which offers free delivery and streaming video, the company will offer a month or more of the subscription at a promotional rate — half off, or at other, better-seeming values, to entice a customer to stay. Staying strong in the face of what may appear to be a good deal can help you stop recurring monthly fees before you forget to cancel them again. Agreeing to yet another trial or promotional rate, which is another on-ramp to auto-enrollment, just continues the cycle, according to consumer advocates. The FTC's rule would have required businesses to obtain a customer’s consent before charging for memberships, auto-renewals and programs linked to free trials. The businesses would have also had to disclose when free trials and promotional offers would end. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit said this week that the FTC made a procedural error by failing to come up with a preliminary regulatory analysis, which is required for rules whose annual impact on the U.S. economy is more than $100 million. The FTC said that it did not have to come up with a preliminary regulatory analysis because it initially determined that the rule’s impact on the national economy would be less than $100 million. An administrative law judge decided that the economic impact would be more than the $100 million threshold, and the court decided to vacate the rule. Former President Joe Biden's administration had included the FTC’s proposal as part of its “Time is Money” initiative, which aimed to crack down on consumer-related hassles. —— “The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

Chemical maker DuPont agrees to $27M settlement in polluted water lawsuit in upstate New York,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/chemical-maker-dupont-agrees-to-27m-settlement-in-polluted-water-lawsuit-in-upstate-new-york-2025-07-11/,"HOOSICK FALLS, N.Y. (AP) — Chemical maker DuPont has agreed to a $27 million settlement to resolve a nearly decade-long lawsuit over the contamination of an upstate New York village's water supply. The deal was announced Wednesday by lawyers representing residents of Hoosick Falls, located northwest of Albany, just as the case was headed to trial in federal court this week. The settlement brings the total recovered in the class action suit brought in 2016 to more than $90 million, lawyers for Rochester-based firm Faraci Lange said. Three other companies — Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics, Honeywell International and 3M —settled for a total of more than $65 million in 2021. DuPont was the last remaining defendant. “We are gratified to have reached what we believe will be the final resolution of this case that will provide significant added benefit to the residents of Hoosick Falls and the Town of Hoosick,” said Stephen Schwarz. DuPont declined to comment Friday, but the Delaware-based company noted that the case relates to E.I. DuPont de Nemours, which operated its performance chemicals business until it was spun out in 2015. The DuPont settlement, which must still be approved by a federal judge, also includes another $6 million in funding for an existing medical monitoring program for exposed residents, according to attorneys. In their class action suit, Hoosick Falls residents claimed that a local Teflon fabric coating facility operated by Saint-Gobain and Honeywell caused local drinking water to become contaminated with perfluorooctanoic acid, or PFOA. DuPont, which made Teflon materials used at the facility, and 3M, which made the PFOA used by DuPont in its products, were added as defendants to the lawsuit in 2018. PFOA was once widely used in certain industrial processes but is now considered a harmful “forever chemical” because it can persist in the environment for decades without decomposing. It has been linked to a number of serious illnesses including kidney and testicular cancer and has recently been classified as a carcinogen. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

Trump's 50% tariff on Brazilian goods like coffee and orange juice could drive up US breakfast costs,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trumps-50-tariff-on-brazilian-goods-like-coffee-and-orange-juice-could-drive-up-us-breakfast-costs-2025-07-11/,"SAO PAULO (AP) — President Donald Trump’s threat to boost import taxes by 50% on Brazilian goods could drive up the cost of breakfast in the United States. The prices of coffee and orange juice — two staples of the American morning diet — could be severely impacted if there's no agreement by Aug. 1. Brazilian beef and regional airliners are also among the products that could be affected by Trump's decision announced Wednesday, which Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva promised on Thursday to reciprocate. Trump’s move this time is overtly political, targeting the Brazilian Supreme Court trial of former president Jair Bolsonaro, an ally of his who was charged for his alleged role in trying to overturn his 2022 election loss. The court’s prosecution of U.S.-based social media companies failing to comply with local laws was also mentioned by Trump in a public letter as a reason to hike Brazil’s trade tariffs. The U.S. Census Bureau said the country had a $6.8 billion trade surplus with Brazil last year. Brazilian exporters, bodies that represent them and politicians — many of whom are friendly with Bolsonaro — have poured criticism on Trump and urged Lula to negotiate, with coffee, beef and orange juice associations rallying to the nation’s defense. “These new tariffs produce direct effects and hit Brazil's agribusiness, impacting the exchange rate, in the rise of the cost of imported inputs and in the competitiveness of Brazilian exports,” Brazil's agribusiness caucus in Congress said in a statement Thursday. Lula said in interviews after Trump's move that the U.S. had a trade surplus with the South American nation of more than $410 billion over the past 15 years, with orange juice and coffee among the few goods made in Brazil that American consumers get in huge numbers. Americans' coffee habit depends almost exclusively on imports. Official U.S. government data shows Brazil, the world’s top coffee producer, supplies about 30% of the American market, followed by Colombia at roughly 20% and Vietnam at about 10%. Global stocks are now low due to climate-related pressures that have recently strained coffee prices. Marcos Matos, executive director of Cecafé, Brazil’s coffee exporters council, said the initial 10% tariff imposed by Trump in April was not as catastrophic as some of Brazil's competitors faced even higher rates. Vietnam, for example, began with a 46% tariff, now reduced to 20%. He sees the proposed increase to 50% as a serious escalation. “It will harm us, coffee exporters, in terms of jobs, income and costs. And it will hurt the American industry and the end consumer, who will end up paying more,” Matos told The Associated Press. He added that agriculture minister Carlos Fávaro told him on Thursday he is looking for alternatives for coffee exporters as he negotiates with the U.S. Ibiapaba Netto, a director at the Brazilian association for citrus juice exporters, said both countries will suffer as Brazil has no replacement for a market that buys about 3 billion liters of its orange juice every year and the U.S. doesn't have enough of the product at home. “About 40% of Brazil's orange juice exports go to the U.S. But about 60% of U.S. imports of orange juice come from Brazil. We are the biggest partner of American companies that make their breakfast juice,” Netto told the AP. “Except for the few companies producing 100% in Florida, every American brand depends on Brazil's orange juice for scale.” Netto added that American brands can survive without Brazil's juice, but now “it will be much harder for them to make their business' wheels spin without it.” “They don't have anywhere else to find our product. The American market is a traditional partner, we always complete each other. These additional tariffs on Brazil do not strengthen orange juice from Florida, they make the whole juice industry weaker and hike the cost for everyone's breakfast in the U.S.,” Netto said. Both Matos and Netto say their producers want Brazil's Lula to keep diplomacy on the table until the very end of negotiations before imposing the country's reciprocity law. When Trump first unveiled his tariff plan in April, many in Brazil hoped the country could benefit since it avoided the harshest penalties imposed on Canada, Mexico and China. “We had been left out, so many people were saying that Brazil would end up benefiting from this,” said Marcos Jank, a professor of global agribusiness at Insper, a business school in São Paulo. “But with this 50% tariff hike, we now face one of the highest tariffs the U.S. is applying. We moved into a losing position.” Airline maker Embraer, another Brazilian company that will be affected if the new tariffs are applied, said in a statement it is “currently assessing the potential impacts on its operations” and whether “the new measure will specifically impact the Brazilian aviation industry.” Analysts of investment manager XP estimate 60% of Embraer's revenue depends on the U.S. “Any material impacts will be addressed during our second-quarter earnings conference call, scheduled for Aug. 5,” Embraer said in a statement. Alongside this, Embraer is actively engaging with the relevant authorities seeking to restore the zero import tax for the aeronautical sector."" The beef sector in Brazil is also in dire straits after Trump's announcement. Roberto Perosa, president of the Brazilian Association of Meat Exporting Industries, said he has been meeting with partners in the U.S. since Wednesday steering negotiations with the Trump administration. Perosa said Brazil's beef industry is not a competitor for the U.S. as the South American nation has offered high production volumes during the livestock shortage cycle in recent years, which has helped American consumers buy cheaper products. “We don’t want to keep being the target of political disputes that harm the Brazilian productive sector,” he said. “The limits of political action cannot come at the expense of our country’s population — or the American population, which will pay the price through higher beef prices."" While Trump’s tariffs are seen as politically motivated, Brazil is working to develop commercial arguments to break the ideological impasse. Luiz Rua, secretary of trade and international relations at Brazil’s Ministry of Agriculture, said there may be room to negotiate tariffs, citing the U.S. interest in accessing the country’s ethanol market. Brazil, in turn, is pushing for better access to the U.S. sugar market. “That’s part of our agricultural negotiations,” Rua said. “There are other discussions beyond my portfolio that involve industrial matters. All of this is being put on the table.” Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

CrowdStrike vs. Cloudflare: Which Cybersecurity Stock Wins?,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/crowdstrike-vs-cloudflare-which-cybersecurity-stock-wins/,"CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. NASDAQ: CRWD is one of the best-performing technology stocks of 2025, with shares up 50% year-to-date. That rally reflects renewed investor confidence in its Falcon platform, which is a true comeback story following the high-profile service outage in 2024. The total addressable market (TAM) for cybersecurity solutions is expected to exceed $500 billion by 2030. This means many companies are looking for their share of the pie. Cloudflare Inc. NYSE: NET is one of those names. In fact, NET stock is up 80% this year, a full 30 percentage points ahead of CrowdStrike. The opportunity in this sector can certainly support investors having more than one cybersecurity stock in their portfolio. But if an investor could only choose one, which of these names might be more attractive? These two cloud-native cybersecurity leaders offer solutions that often appear to overlap. However, their business models, core technologies, and growth trajectories are distinctly different. The core of CrowdStrike’s business is its Falcon platform. This allows customers to take an à la carte approach to their cybersecurity needs, using as much or as little of the Falcon platform as they need. Several legacy security vendors, such as Palo Alto Networks Inc. NASDAQ: PANW, began pivoting to platform-based models in the mid-2010s. However, CrowdStrike distinguished itself as an early pioneer of a cloud-native security platform. By launching Falcon as an integrated endpoint and threat intelligence solution from day one, CrowdStrike set the standard for how a modern, scalable cybersecurity platform could replace fragmented point products This platformization model was a key lever that CrowdStrike pulled as it worked to regain customer trust after the 2024 outage. It offered customers the opportunity to use some of Falcon’s platform services at no cost for a limited time. The company now expects its goodwill measure to turn into actual revenue in the coming quarters. Cloudflare’s Cloudflare One suite is a cloud-native platform that combines a range of services delivered from the same infrastructure that powers its CDN and DDoS protection. While Cloudflare still derives most of its revenue from networking and CDN services, the company is rapidly emerging as a force in Zero Trust security. Its Cloudflare One suite delivers identity, access, and application protection at the edge without relying on traditional firewalls. With one of the largest global edge networks, Cloudflare is well-positioned to scale Zero Trust access with low latency and high security. Zero Trust remains a relatively small part of Cloudflare’s overall revenue, but its freemium, self-serve model gives it a massive top-of-funnel that it can leverage to convert more paid Zero Trust and enterprise security customers over time. As noted in the introduction, CrowdStrike and Cloudflare are both having strong years. However, both are overvalued when you compare their respective stock prices to analysts’ consensus price targets. That suggests both stocks could be ready for significant pullbacks. So, which stock makes more sense to buy when that dip occurs? That may depend on your investment objectives and risk tolerance.

Super Micro Computer: The Hidden Winner of Soaring Copper Tariffs,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/super-micro-computer-the-hidden-winner-of-soaring-copper-tariffs/,"The latest round of tariff implementations from the United States has landed on metals, this time centered on copper. As a reaction to a 50% tariff on copper trade with the United States, the open market price of the metal shot up by over 10% in a single day. Judging by how much demand there will be for it in the future, this theme may only be the beginning of a longer-term increase. Any developing economy needs copper for housing and infrastructure, and even developed nations like the United States will always have a continuing need for this commodity, especially as the market share of electric vehicles (EVs) grows larger. However, there is one quiet boom happening right now in the technology sector that will likely push copper prices to heights not seen before. The rise of artificial intelligence and the data center infrastructure behind it will be the culprit of copper demand moving forward, since all of this expansion and electricity demand will likely be realized by market forces and reflected in market prices. This is precisely where Super Micro Computer Inc. NASDAQ: SMCI comes into play as an aid to this change in prices. During the week of the copper tariffs announcement, shares of Super Micro Computer stock rose by up to 4.3%, which is on top of the broader 18% rally investors rode during the past month alone. The reason for this bullish reaction may not be so simple to the untrained investor, which is where this information becomes more valuable. As copper prices go up, the cost of building and implementing new data center locations for artificial intelligence development also goes up. This means that the market forces will likely shift to a focus on efficiency rather than quantity, and capacity cost efficiency can only be achieved by doing more with what’s already built today. To increase efficiency and avoid the need to expand networks as rapidly as in recent months, operators must reduce the load in current data centers in terms of heat and wiring. No player like Super Micro Computer in the market offers both of these solutions, and that’s why the stock is reacting the way it is. With its new liquid-cooling technology for data centers and artificial intelligence infrastructure, Super Micro Computer stands to fix the immediate issue that most companies are now facing as the price of copper rises and is likely set to continue higher. Every bit of success that investors see in stocks like NVIDIA Co. NASDAQ: NVDA and other semiconductor names will directly translate into a need to keep pushing out more data center infrastructure. Not only that, the growth of cloud computing in names like Amazon.com Inc. NASDAQ: AMZN is also a major tailwind that’s here to stay. With this in mind, the most vital players in the American technology market will feel the need to become more efficient, as brute force expansion is now the costliest it has ever been. That is exactly why Super Micro Computer has become the premium name in its peer group. Wall Street analysts expect Super Micro Computer to deliver up to $0.74 in earnings per share (EPS) for the fourth quarter of 2025, and these forecasts likely haven’t priced in the potential demand boost that may come from higher copper prices. More than that, it seems that the market hasn’t realized this outcome yet. Those worried about whether they missed the boat on Super Micro Computer’s rally can lean on the fact that the stock still trades at a discount. A price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of only 26.4x would place this stock below the computer sector’s average valuation of 37.3x, and that says a lot. This discount indicates that the market remains focused on the major players in the space, prioritizing how higher copper prices may initially impact them. Smart investors, however, could gain an edge by extrapolating these effects and see how Super Micro Computer may benefit way ahead of the broader market, realizing this fact. Short sellers know, though, as up to 8.1% of Super Micro Computer’s short interest has declined over the past month, a clear sign of bearish capitulation. On the other hand, over $500 million in institutional buying activity has come into the stock across the past two quarters, showing investors the anticipation by “smart money” of some catalyst to come. That catalyst is now here, and seeing Super Micro Computer stock trade at only 50% of its 52-week high gives investors ample room to see the company reclaim its previous highs, if not make a new high altogether. This asymmetric setup shouldn’t be ignored in this new industry change. Before you consider Super Micro Computer, you'll want to hear this.

Walgreens shareholders approve $10 billion private equity buyout,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/walgreens-shareholders-approve-10-billion-private-equity-buyout-2025-07-11/,"Shareholders of Walgreens Boots Alliance overwhelmingly approved the drugstore chain's $10 billion acquisition by private equity firm Sycamore. It is a rough era for national pharmacy chains like Walgreens, CVS, and Rite-Aid, closing hundreds of stores due to changing consumer behavior, declining pharmacy reimbursements and rising costs. Walgreens will close more than 1,000 stores through 2027 and Rite-Aid filed for bankruptcy protection in May, it's second trip to bankruptcy court in as many years. Walgreens shareholders will receive $11.45 per share from Sycamore Partners per the terms of the deal first announced in March, the companies said Friday. They could also receive as much as an additional $3 per share from the future monetization of Walgreens' debt and equity interests in its VillageMD clinic business. The buyout, which will take the drugstore chain private, will give it more flexibility to make changes to improve its business without worrying about Wall Street’s reaction. Walgreens was founded in 1901 and has been a public company since 1927. “With Sycamore’s partnership, we will be better positioned to accelerate our turnaround strategy,” said Walgreens CEO Tim Wentworth. Walgreens shares were largely unchanged by Friday’s news, hovering around $11.50, as they have since the deal was announced. Just two years ago, they were worth more than $30 each. Last fall, the company announced a plan to close 1,200 of its roughly 8,500 U.S. locations. The company, based just north of Chicago in Deerfield, Illinois, had already shed about a thousand U.S. stores since it grew to nearly 9,500 after buying some Rite Aid locations in 2018.

Elon Musk's X platform investigated in France for alleged data tampering and fraud,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/elon-musks-x-platform-investigated-in-france-for-alleged-data-tampering-and-fraud-2025-07-11/,"PARIS (AP) — French prosecutors have launched a police investigation into alleged data tampering and fraud involving X, Elon Musk’s social media platform. The Paris prosecutor's office, in a statement Friday, announced the opening of the investigation, and said that a branch of the French gendarmerie is conducting the inquiry. The investigation is looking into two alleged offenses “in particular” — organized tampering with the functioning of an automated data processing system, and organized fraudulent extraction of data from an automated data processing system, the statement said. It didn't give details of the alleged wrongdoing. It said that the investigation is targeting both the platform and people, without naming them or saying what role they might have within X. The prosecutor's office said that it was acting on information that two people provided in January to its cybercrimes unit. One of them is a member of parliament, and the other is a senior official in a French government institution. It didn't identify them or the institution. It said the two people alleged the suspected use of X’s algorithm for the “purposes of foreign interference.” It didn't detail the alleged interference or how the algorithm was allegedly used. The prosecutor’s office said that it decided this week to open the police investigation, after conducting its own ""verifications” and having received additional information from French researchers and “various public institutions.” The Associated Press has emailed X's press office, seeking comment. ___ Kelvin Chan contributed to this report from London.

"At least 4 presumed dead, 11 missing after Houthi rebels sink ship in Red Sea, EU naval mission says",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/at-least-4-presumed-dead-11-missing-after-houthi-rebels-sink-ship-in-red-sea-eu-naval-mission-says-2025-07-11/,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Four people are presumed dead and 11 others are still missing after a Liberian-flagged cargo ship sank in the Red Sea following an attack by Yemen's Houthi rebels, a European Union naval mission said Friday. The update from the EU's Operation Aspides came as private security forces continue to search for survivors from the Eternity C, a Greek-owned bulk carrier that sank on Wednesday. Ten people were recovered alive from the attack, including eight Filipino crew members and a Greek and Indian from the vessel’s three-man security team, the EU operation said. Fifteen people remain unaccounted for, including the four presumed dead, the mission said. “All nearby vessels are advised to have a sharp look out,” the EU mission said. The Houthis have said they hold some of the crew. The U.S. Embassy in Yemen — which has operated from Saudi Arabia for about a decade — has described the Houthis as having “kidnapped” the mariners. The death toll is the highest from any seaborne assault carried out by the Iranian-backed Houthis in the crucial maritime trade route where $1 trillion in cargo once passed through annually. The rebels say they are attacking ships to support Palestinians in the Gaza Strip during the Israel-Hamas war, and have in total sank four vessels and killed sailors who had no direct role in the war. The attack on the Eternity C followed the sinking of the bulk carrier Magic Seas in a similar attack last weekend. Neither the European naval force nor the U.S. had been escorting the two vessels when they were attacked. United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres condemned the Houthi attacks, calling them “a dangerous re-escalation in this critical waterway.” “Beyond being an unacceptable attack on the safety and security of seafarers, these acts also violated the freedom of navigation, caused a hazard to maritime transport and represent a serious risk of a significant environmental, economic and humanitarian damage to an already vulnerable coastal environment,” he added in a statement. The Houthis have held mariners in the past. After seizing the vehicle carrier Galaxy Leader in November 2023, the rebels held the crew until January this year. From November 2023 to December 2024, the Houthis targeted more than 100 ships with missiles and drones. The stopped their attacks during a brief ceasefire in the war. They later became the target of an intense weekslong campaign of airstrikes ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump before he declared a ceasefire had been reached with the rebels. A new possible ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war — as well as the future of talks between the U.S. and Iran over Tehran’s battered nuclear program — remain in the balance.

Wind turbine maker to pay settlement after blade broke apart and washed up on Nantucket beaches,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/wind-turbine-maker-to-pay-settlement-after-blade-broke-apart-and-washed-up-on-nantucket-beaches-2025-07-11/,"NANTUCKET, Mass. (AP) — The maker of a massive wind turbine blade that broke apart off Nantucket Island and washed up on beaches for months has agreed to a $10.5 million settlement to pay local businesses for their economic losses, officials said Friday. Fiberglass fragments of the blade began washing ashore last summer during the peak of tourist season after pieces of the wind turbine at the Vineyard Wind project began falling into the Atlantic Ocean in July 2024. GE Vernova, which agreed to the settlement, blamed a manufacturing problem at one of its factories in Canada and said there was no indication of a design flaw. It reinspected all blades made at the factory and removed other blades made there from the Vineyard Wind location. Crews in boats and on beaches, along with volunteers, collected truckloads of debris. The company said the debris was nontoxic fiberglass fragments and that the pieces were one square foot or smaller. The settlement calls for establishing a fund along with a process to evaluate claims from businesses and distribute payments, Nantucket officials said. The development’s massive wind turbines with blades more than 328 feet (100 meters) long began sending electricity to the grid at the beginning of 2024.

"Time runs out for nearly century-old Michigan clock company due to tariffs, other factors",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/time-runs-out-for-nearly-century-old-michigan-clock-company-due-to-tariffs-other-factors-2025-07-11/,"ZEELAND, Mich. (AP) — A Michigan clock company that has helped people keep time for 99 years says it's going out of business due to tariffs and other economic conditions. Howard Miller Co., which makes grandfather clocks, wall clocks and furniture, said production will be phased out this year. The company will stick around in 2026 to sell its inventory. “We are incredibly disappointed to have reached this point in our journey,” CEO Howard J. “Buzz” Miller, grandson of founder Howard C. Miller, said Thursday. The Zeeland-based manufacturer, 175 miles (281.6 kilometers) west of Detroit, has sought a buyer but so far hasn't found one. “Furniture sales are closely linked to the health of the housing market, which is struggling,” Miller said. “Our hopes for a market recovery early in the year were quickly dashed as tariffs rattled the supply chain, sparked recession fears and pushed mortgage rates higher. The furniture industry continues to shed jobs and announce plant closings."" Miller said tariffs imposed by the Trump administration have increased the cost of essential components that aren't available in the U.S. The company employs roughly 200 people in Michigan and North Carolina. The closing of Howard Miller also includes Hekman Furniture Co., which it acquired in 1983. The clock business was founded in 1926. “Clockmaking has a massive impact on Zeeland’s economic development, on its culture, on its industry,” Zeeland Historical Society Director Katelyn VerMerris told WOOD-TV. “Clocks were one of the major exports from Zeeland for most of the 20th century.” Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

"Walmart recalls 850,000 water bottles after two consumers suffer vision loss from ejecting caps",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/walmart-recalls-850000-water-bottles-after-two-consumers-suffer-vision-loss-from-ejecting-lids-2025-07-11/,"NEW YORK (AP) — Walmart is recalling about 850,000 stainless steel water bottles because the lid can “forcefully eject” and unexpectedly strike consumers — resulting in permanent vision loss for two people to date. The recall covers Walmart's “Ozark Trail 64 oz Stainless Steel Insulated Water Bottles,"" which have been sold at the chain's stores across the country since 2017. According to a notice published by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission on Thursday, these products pose “serious impact and laceration hazards.” That's because when a consumer attempts to open the bottles “after food, carbonated beverages or perishable beverages, such as juice or milk, are stored inside over time,” the lid can eject forcefully, the CPSC notes. As of Thursday's announcement, Walmart had received three reports of consumers who were injured after being struck in the face by these lids when opening their bottles. And two of those people “suffered permanent vision loss after being struck in the eye,” the CPSC added. Consumers are urged to stop using the now-recalled Ozark Trail bottles — and contact Walmart for a full refund. Shoppers can also bring the products to their local Walmart store for that compensation. “The health and safety of our customers is always a top priority,"" Walmart said in a statement sent to The Associated Press. The company added that it had “fully cooperated” with the CPSC and the manufacturer of the recalled product “to remove it from our stores and notify consumers"" The bottles being recalled can also be identified by their model number, 83-662 — which doesn't appear on the product itself, but would show on packaging. The stainless-steel base is silver and the lid is a black, one-piece screw cap. There is also an Ozark Trail logo embedded on the side of the 64-ounce bottle.
