"How high-tech tools, and pigs, could help in the search for Mexican drug cartel victims",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/how-high-tech-tools-and-pigs-could-help-in-the-search-for-mexican-drug-cartel-victims-2025-07-28/,"ZAPOPAN, Mexico (AP) — First the scientists dress dead swine in clothes, then they dispose of the carcasses. Some they wrap in packing tape, others they chop up. They stuff the animals into plastic bags or wrap them in blankets. They cover them in lime or burn them. Some are buried alone, others in groups. Then they watch. The pigs are playing an unlikely role as proxies for humans in research to help find the staggering number of people who have gone missing in Mexico during decades of drug cartel violence. Families of the missing are usually left to look for their loved ones with little support from authorities. But now, government scientists are testing the newest satellite, geophysical and biological mapping techniques — along with the pigs — to offer clues that they hope could lead to the discovery of at least some of the bodies. The ranks of Mexico’s missing exploded in the years following the launch of then-President Felipe Calderón’s war against drug cartels in 2006. A strategy that targeted the leaders of a handful of powerful cartels led to a splintering of organized crime and the multiplication of violence to control territory. With near complete impunity, owing to the complicity or inaction of the authorities, cartels found that making anyone they think is in their way disappear was better than leaving bodies in the street. Mexican administrations have sometimes been unwilling to recognize the problem and at other times are staggered by the scale of violence their justice system is unprepared to address. Mexico’s disappeared could populate a small city. Official data in 2013 tallied 26,000 missing, but the count now surpasses 130,000 — more than any other Latin American nation. The United Nations has said there are indications that the disappearances are “generalized or systematic.” If the missing people are found — dead or alive — it is usually by their loved ones. Guided by information from witnesses, parents and siblings search for graves by walking through cartel territory, plunging a metal rod into the earth and sniffing for the scent of death. Around 6,000 clandestine graves have been found since 2007, and new discoveries are made all the time. Tens of thousands of remains have yet to be identified. Jalisco, which is home to the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, has the largest number of people reported missing in Mexico: 15,500. In March, human bone fragments and hundreds of items of clothing were discovered at a cartel ranch in the state. Authorities denied it was the site of a mass grave. José Luis Silván, a coordinator of the mapping project and scientist at CentroGeo, a federal research institute focused on geospacial information, said Jalisco’s disappeared are “why we’re here.” The mapping project, launched in 2023, is a collaboration by Guadalajara University, Mexico’s National Autonomous University and the University of Oxford in England, alongside the Jalisco Search Commission, a state agency that organizes local searches with relatives. “No other country is pushing so strongly, so creatively"" to test and combine new techniques, said Derek Congram, a Canadian forensic anthropologist, whose expertise in geographic information systems inspired the Mexican project. Still, Congram warns, technology “is not a panacea.” “Ninety percent of searches are resolved with a good witness and digging,” he said. Silván walks by a site where scientists buried 14 pigs about two years ago. He says they may not know how well the technology works, where and when it can be used, or under what conditions, for at least three years. “Flowers came up because of the phosphorous at the surface, we didn’t see that last year,” he said as he took measurements at one of the gravesites. “The mothers who search say that that little yellow flower always blooms over the tombs and they use them as a guide.” Pigs and humans are closely related, famously sharing about 98% of DNA. But for the mapping project, the physical similarities also matter. According to the U.S. National Library of Medicine, pigs resemble humans in size, fat distribution and the structure and thickness of skin. A big Colombian drone mounted with a hyperspectral camera flies over the pig burial site. Generally used by mining companies, the camera measures light reflected by substances in the soil, including nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus, and shows how they vary as the pigs decompose. The colorful image it produces offers clues of what to look for in the hunt for graves. “This isn’t pure science,” Silván said. “It is science and action. Everything learned has to be applied immediately, rather than wait for it to mature, because there’s urgency.” Researchers also employ thermal drones, laser scanners and other gadgets to register anomalies, underground movements and electrical currents. One set of graves is encased behind a pane of transparent acrylic, providing a window for scientists to observe the pigs’ decomposition in real time. The Jalisco commission compares and analyzes flies, beetles, plants and soil recovered from the human and pig graves. Each grave is a living “micro ecosystem,” said Tunuari Chávez, the commission's director of context analysis. Triggered by the disappearance of 43 students in 2014, Silván and his colleagues started gathering information about ground-penetrating radar, electric resistivity and satellite imagery from around the world. They studied University of Tennessee research on human corpses buried at a “body farm.” They looked at grave-mapping techniques used in the Balkans, Colombia and Ukraine. “What good is science or technology if it doesn’t solve problems?” he said. They learned new applications of satellite analysis, then began their first experiments burying pigs and studying the substances criminals use to dispose of bodies. They found lime is easily detected, but hydrocarbons, hydrochloric acid and burned flesh are not. Chávez’s team worked to combine the science with what they knew about how the cartels operate. For example, they determined that disappearances in Jalisco commonly happened along cartel routes between Pacific ports, drug manufacturing facilities and the U.S. border, and that most of the missing are found in the same municipality where they disappeared. The experience of the families of the missing also informs the research. Some observed that graves are often found under trees whose roots grow vertically, so those digging the graves can remain in the shade. Mothers of missing loved ones invited by researchers to visit one of the pig burial sites were able to identify most of the unmarked graves by sight alone, because of the plants and soil placement, Silván said. “The knowledge flows in both directions,” he said. Maribel Cedeño, who has been looking for her missing brother for four years, said she believes the drones and other technology will be helpful. “I never imagined being in this situation, finding bodies, becoming such an expert,” she said of her quest. Héctor Flores has been searching for his son since 2021. He questions why so much time and effort has been invested in methods that have not led to concrete discoveries, when the families have proven track records with little official support. Although the research has not yet concluded, the Jalisco Search Commission is already using a thermal drone, a laser scanner and a multispectral camera to help families look for their missing relatives in some cases. But it is unclear whether authorities across Mexico will ever be willing to use, or able to afford, the high-tech aides. Congram, the forensic scientist, said researchers are aware of the limitations of technology, but that “you always have to try, fail, fail again and keep trying.” Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

Krill catch in Antarctica soars to record following collapse of conservation deal,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/krill-catch-in-antarctica-soars-to-record-following-collapse-of-conservation-deal-2025-07-28/,"MIAMI (AP) — Trawling near Antarctica for krill — a crustacean central to the diet of whales and a critical buffer to global warming — has surged to a record and is fast approaching a never before reached seasonal catch limit that would trigger the unprecedented early closure of the remote fishery, The Associated Press has learned. The fishing boom follows the failure last year of the U.S., Russia, China and two dozen other governments to approve a new management plan that would have mandated spreading out the area in which krill can be caught and creating a California-sized reserve along the environmentally sensitive Antarctic Peninsula. In the first seven months of the 2024-25 season, krill fishing in Antarctica reached 518,568 tons, about 84% of the 620,000-ton limit that, once reached, will force the fishery to automatically close. In one hot spot, the catch through June 30 was nearly 60% higher than all of last year’s haul, according to a report from the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, or CCAMLR, the international organization that manages the world's southernmost fishery. The report, which has not been publicly released and CCAMLR said contains confidential data, was shared with The AP by someone concerned about overfishing in Antarctica on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release the information. “The vast majority of the krill take is from an increasingly smaller area,” said Capt. Peter Hammarstedt, campaign director for conservation group Sea Shepherd Global, which this year made its third voyage to Antarctica to document the fishery. “It’s the equivalent of a hunter saying that they’re only killing 1% of the U.S.’ deer population but leaving out that all of the deer were shot in Rhode Island.” Krill is one of the most abundant marine species in the world, with an estimated biomass of 63 million metric tons. But advances in fishing, climate change and growing demand for krill’s Omega-3 rich oil – for fishmeal, pet food and human dietary supplements — have increased pressure on the krill stocks. In the 2023-24 season, a fleet of 12 industrial trawlers from mostly Norway and China caught 498,350 tons of krill — until now the largest harvest since CCAMLR began collecting catch data in 1973. AP journalists traveled to the icy waters around Antarctica in 2023 and observed how factory ships trawl in close proximity to whales whose numbers are still recovering from a century of industrial culling that nearly drove them to extinction. Underscoring the competition between humans and whales, three humpback whales were found dead or seriously injured last year in the long, cylindrical nets deployed by the vessels to vacuum up the paper-clip sized crustacean. Officials have been negotiating for years a new management plan that would balance the growing market for krill with calls for greater protection of the Antarctic Peninsula, the continent's northernmost point and an area teeming with whales and, increasingly, tourists. Currently, less than 5% of the Southern Ocean is protected — well behind CCAMLR’s target and a United Nations goal to preserve 30% of the world’s oceans by 2030. But a tentative deal fell apart at last year’s CCAMLR meeting over a last minute proposal by the United Kingdom and Australia for an even lower catch limit than the one agreed to during talks, AP reported last year. China, objecting to the persistent Western demands, then withdrew its support for the marine reserve and refused to renew the existing management system. “The truth was it was the UK,” Matts Johansen, chief executive of Norway's Aker BioMarine, the world's largest supplier of krill-based products, said at the United Nations Oceans conference in June. “Just a couple days before the vote, the UK threw another suggestion and that's when the Chinese backed off.” A spokesperson for the UK Foreign Office rejected that characterization and said the British government continues to push for a krill management strategy that better safeguards Antarctic marine species and vulnerable ecosystems. In the absence of a deal, restrictions adopted 15 years ago to spread out the catch limit expired, allowing the krill fleet to essentially fish anywhere at any time, including in smaller habitats preferred by whales and other animals such as penguins and seals. Krill aren't just vital to marine ecosystems. Increasingly, researchers are focusing on their role as a bulwark against climate change. One peer-reviewed study last year found that krill remove from the atmosphere and store in the ocean 20 million tons of carbon annually. That’s the equivalent of taking off the road 5 million cars every year. CCAMLR declined to comment on the report obtained by the AP. Ship tracking data analyzed by Global Fishing Watch at the request of the AP also showed a higher concentration of trawling. Activity in one popular fishing ground, denoted Sub-Area 48.1, appears to have more than doubled so far this season compared to the entire 2023-2024 season, according to the the U.S.-based group, which supports sustainable fishing. Javier Arata, the executive director the Association of Responsible Krill harvesting companies, whose members are responsible for 95% of the krill taken from Antarctica, said the catch limit that lapsed was always intended as an interim measure. His group supports the creation of marine protected areas in Antarctica. But it rejects waiting for a conservation deal to adopt “ready-to-go measures” raising the quota, which he said can be much higher. “The failure to advance management was political, not scientific,” he said. The current fishing levels, although higher than previous limits, remain sustainable and reflect the consensus recommendation of scientists before last year’s deal fell apart, Arata added. — This story was supported by funding from the Walton Family Foundation.

Asian shares mostly slip as focus shifts to US talks with China,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/asian-shares-mostly-slip-as-focus-shifts-to-us-talks-with-china-2025-07-28/,"TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares mostly declined Tuesday as some of the euphoria fizzled out over a tariff deal with Japan as proposed by President Donald Trump, which was followed by a similar deal with the European Union. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 slipped nearly 0.7% to 40,725.23. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 lost 0.3% to 8,670.50. South Korea's Kospi was little changed after reversing earlier losses, edging less than 0.1% higher to 3,212.59. Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 1.1% to 25,276.36, while the Shanghai Composite shed 0.3% to 3,586.93. Analysts said markets were watching for the latest from Trump, which are now focused on the talks with China. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng were meeting in Sweden. Bessent has said the negotiations will likely lead to an extension of current tariff levels. There was no significant new information after the first day of talks. “Aside from addressing economic imbalances, tariffs are also now well entrenched in the geo-political arena,” Tan Boon Heng of the Asia & Oceania Treasury Department at Mizuho Bank said in a commentary. Last week, Trump announced a trade framework, placing a 15% tax on goods imported from Japan, a level far lower than the earlier 25% rate that the president had indicated. Trump also said Japan would invest $550 billion into the U.S. and open up to U.S. autos and rice. Details are still unclear, but the accord set off some momentary relief. U.S. stock indexes drifted through a quiet Monday after the United States agreed to tax cars and other products coming from the European Union at a 15% rate, lower than Trump had threatened. Many details of the trade deal are still to be worked out, and Wall Street is heading into a week full of potential flashpoints that could shake markets, including an interest rate decision Wednesday by the Federal Reserve. The widespread expectation on Wall Street is that Fed officials will wait until September to resume cutting interest rates, though a couple of Trump’s appointees could dissent in the vote. The Fed has been on hold with interest rates this year since cutting them several times at the end of 2024. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 was nearly flat, edging up by less than 0.1% to 6,389.77 and setting an all-time high for a sixth straight day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.1% to 44,837.56, while the Nasdaq composite added 0.3% to its own record, closing at 21,178.58. Tesla rose 3% after its CEO, Elon Musk, said it had signed a deal with Samsung Electronics that could be worth more than $16.5 billion to provide computer chips for the electric-vehicle company. Samsung’s stock in South Korea jumped 6.8%. Other companies in the chip and artificial-intelligence industries were strong, continuing their run from last week after Alphabet said it was increasing its spending on AI chips and other investments to $85 billion this year. Chip company Advanced Micro Devices rose 4.3%, and server-maker Super Micro Computer climbed 10.2%. But an 8.3% drop for Revvity helped to keep the market in check. The company in the life sciences and diagnostics businesses reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than Wall Street expected, but its forecast for full year profit disappointed analysts. Companies are broadly under pressure to deliver solid growth in profits following big jumps in their stock prices the last few months. Much of the gain was due to hopes that Trump would walk back some of his stiff proposed tariffs, and critics say the U.S. stock market looks expensive unless companies will produce bigger profits. Hundreds of U.S. companies are lined up to report how much profit they made during the spring, with nearly a third of the businesses in the S&P 500 index scheduled to deliver updates. In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude inched up 1 cent to $66.72 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, added 6 cents to $70.10 a barrel. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar rose to 148.56 Japanse yen from 148.54 yen. The euro cost $1.1600, up from $1.1593. ___ AP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed.

"The beauty industry loves argan oil. But demand, and drought, are straining Morocco and its trees",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/the-beauty-industry-loves-argan-oil-but-demand-and-drought-are-straining-morocco-and-its-trees-2025-07-28/,"SMIMOU, Morocco (AP) — Argan oil runs through your fingers like liquid gold — hydrating, luscious, and restorative. Prized worldwide as a miracle cosmetic, it’s more than that in Morocco. It’s a lifeline for rural women and a byproduct of a forest slowly buckling under the weight of growing demand. To make it, women crouch over stone mills and grind down kernels. One kilogram — roughly two days of work — earns them around $3, enough for a modest foothold in an economy where opportunities are scarce. It also links them to generations past. “We were born and raised here. These traditions come from nature, what our parents and grandparents have taught us and what we’ve inherited,” cooperative worker Fatma Mnir said. Long a staple in local markets, argan oil today is in luxury hair and skin care products lining drugstore aisles worldwide. But its runaway popularity is threatening argan forests, with overharvesting piled on top of drought straining trees once seen as resilient in the harshest of conditions. Hafida El Hantati, owner of one of the cooperatives that harvests the fruit and presses it for oil, said the stakes go beyond the trees, threatening cherished traditions. “We must take care of this tree and protect it because if we lose it, we will lose everything that defines us and what we have now,” she said at the Ajddigue cooperative outside the coastal town of Essaouira. For centuries, argan trees have supported life in the arid hills between the Atlantic Ocean and the Atlas Mountains, feeding people and animals, holding soil in place and helping keep the desert from spreading. The spiny trees can survive in areas with less than an inch of annual rain and heat up to 50 degrees Celsius (122 Fahrenheit). They endure drought with roots that stretch as far as 115 feet (35 meters) underground. Goats climb trees, chomp their fruit, and eventually disperse seeds as part of the forest's regeneration cycle. Moroccans stir the oil into nut butters and drizzle it over tagines. Rich in vitamin E, it's lathered onto dry hair and skin to plump, moisturize and stave off damage. Some use it to calm eczema or heal chicken pox. But the forest has thinned. Trees bear fewer fruit, their branches gnarled from thirst. In many places, cultivated land has replaced them as fields of citrus and tomatoes, many grown for export, have expanded. Communities once managed forests collectively, setting rules for grazing and harvesting. Now the system is fraying, with theft routinely reported. But a forest that covered about 5,405 square miles (14,000 square kilometers) at the turn of the century has shrunk by 40%. Scientists warn that argan trees are not invincible. “Because argan trees acted as a green curtain protecting a large part of southern Morocco against the encroaching Sahara, their slow disappearance has become considered as an ecological disaster,” said Zoubida Charrouf, a chemist who researches argan at Université Mohammed V in Rabat. Shifting climate is a part of the problem. Fruit and flowers sprout earlier each year as rising temperatures push the seasons out of sync. Goats that help spread seeds can be destructive, too, especially if they feed on seedlings before they mature. Overgrazing has become worse as herders and fruit collectors fleeing drier regions encroach on plots long allocated to specific families. The forests also face threats from camels bred and raised by the region's wealthy. Camels stretch their necks into trees and chomp entire branches, leaving lasting damage, Charrouf said. Today, women peel, crack and press argan for oil at hundreds of cooperatives. Much makes its way through middlemen to be sold in products by companies and subsidiaries of L’Oréal, Unilever, and Estée Lauder. But workers say they earn little while watching profits flow elsewhere. Cooperatives say much of the pressure stems from climbing prices. A 1-liter bottle sells for 600 Moroccan dirhams ($60), up from 25 dirhams ($2.50) three decades ago. Products infused with argan sell for even more abroad. Cosmetics companies call argan the most expensive vegetal oil on the market. The coronavirus pandemic upended global demand and prices and many cooperatives closed. Cooperative leaders say new competitors have flooded the market just as drought has diminished how much oil can be squeezed from each fruit. Cooperatives were set up to provide women a base pay and share profits each month. But Union of Women’s Argan Cooperatives President Jamila Id Bourrous said few make more than Morocco’s minimum monthly wage. “The people who sell the final product are the ones making the money,"" she said. Some businesses say large multinational companies use their size to set prices and shut others out. Khadija Saye, a co-owner of Ageourde Cooperative, said there were real fears about monopoly. “Don’t compete with the poor for the one thing they live from,"" she said. ""When you take their model and do it better because you have money, it’s not competition, it’s displacement."" One company, Olvea, controls 70% of the export market, according to data from local cooperatives. Cooperatives say few competitors can match its capacity to fill big orders for global brands. Representatives for the company did not respond to requests for comment. On a hill overlooking the Atlantic, a government water truck weaves between rows of trees, pausing to hose saplings that have just started to sprout. The trees are a project that Morocco began in 2018, planting 39 square miles (100 square kilometers) on private lands abutting the forests. To conserve water and improve soil fertility, argan trees alternate rows with capers, a technique known as intercropping. The idea is to expand forest cover and show that argan, if properly managed, can be a viable source of income. Officials hope it will ease pressure on the overharvested commons and convince others to reinvest in the land. The trees were expected to begin producing this year but haven't during a drought. Another issue is the supply chain. “Between the woman in the village and the final buyer, there are four intermediaries. Each takes a cut. The cooperatives can’t afford to store, so they sell cheap to someone who pays upfront,” Id Bourrous, the union president, said. The government has attempted to build storage centers to help producers hold onto their goods longer and negotiate better deals. So far, cooperatives say it hasn’t worked, but a new version is expected in 2026 with fewer barriers to access. Despite problems, there's money to be made. During harvest season, women walk into the forest with sacks, scanning the ground for fallen fruit. To El Hantati, the forest, once thick and humming with life, feels quieter now. Only the winds and creaking trees are audible as goats climb branches in search of remaining fruits and leaves. “When I was young, we’d head into the forest at dawn with our food and spend the whole day gathering. The trees were green all year long,” she said. She paused, worried about the future as younger generations pursue education and opportunities in larger cities. “I’m the last generation that lived our traditions — weddings, births, even the way we made oil. It’s all fading.” ___ Islam Aatfaoui contributed reporting. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Cheyenne to host massive AI data center using more electricity than all Wyoming homes combined,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/cheyenne-to-host-massive-ai-data-center-using-more-electricity-than-all-wyoming-homes-combined-2025-07-28/,"CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) — An artificial intelligence data center that would use more electricity than every home in Wyoming combined before expanding to as much as five times that size will be built soon near Cheyenne, according to the city's mayor. “It’s a game changer. It’s huge,” Mayor Patrick Collins said Monday. With cool weather — good for keeping computer temperatures down — and an abundance of inexpensive electricity from a top energy-producing state, Wyoming's capital has become a hub of computing power. The city has been home to Microsoft data centers since 2012. An $800 million data center announced last year by Facebook parent company Meta Platforms is nearing completion, Collins said. The latest data center, a joint effort between regional energy infrastructure company Tallgrass and AI data center developer Crusoe, would begin at 1.8 gigawatts of electricity and be scalable to 10 gigawatts, according to a joint company statement. A gigawatt can power as many as 1 million homes. But that's more homes than Wyoming has people. The least populated state, Wyoming, has about 590,000 people. And it's a major exporter of energy. A top producer of coal, oil and gas, Wyoming ranks behind only Texas, New Mexico and Pennsylvania as a top net energy-producing state, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Accounting for fossil fuels, Wyoming produces about 12 times more energy than it consumes. The state exports almost three-fifths of the electricity it produces, according to the EIA. But this proposed data center is so big, it would have its own dedicated energy from gas generation and renewable sources, according to Collins and company officials. Gov. Mark Gordon praised the project's value to the state's gas industry. “This is exciting news for Wyoming and for Wyoming natural gas producers,"" Gordon said in the statement. While data centers are energy-hungry, experts say companies can help reduce their effect on the climate by powering them with renewable energy rather than fossil fuels. Even so, electricity customers might see their bills increase as utilities plan for massive data projects on the grid. The data center would be built several miles (kilometers) south of Cheyenne off U.S. 85 near the Colorado state line. State and local regulators would need to sign off on the project, but Collins was optimistic construction could begin soon. ""I believe their plans are to go sooner rather than later,” Collins said. OpenAI, the developer of Chat GPT, has been scouring the U.S. for sites for a massive AI data center effort called Stargate, but a Crusoe spokesperson declined to say if the Cheyenne project was one. “We are not at a stage that we are ready to announce our tenant there,” said the spokesperson, Andrew Schmitt. “I can’t confirm or deny that is going to be one of the stargate."" Recently, OpenAI announced it had switched on the first phase of a Crusoe-built data center complex in Abilene, Texas, in a partnership with software giant Oracle. “To the best of our knowledge, it is the largest data center — we think of it as a campus — in the world,” OpenAI’s chief global affairs officer Chris Lehane told The Associated Press last week. “It generates, roughly and depending how you count, about a gigawatt of energy.” OpenAI has also been looking elsewhere in the U.S. to expand its data centers. It said last week that it has entered into an agreement with Oracle to develop another 4.5 gigawatts of data center capacity. “We’re now in a position where we have, in a really concrete way, identified over five gigawatts of energy that we’re going to be able to build around,” Lehane said. OpenAI hasn’t named any locations, besides its flagship site in Texas, where it plans to build data centers. As of earlier this year, Wyoming was not one of the 16 states where OpenAI said it was looking for locations to build new data centers. ___ O'Brien reported from Austin, Texas.

Waymo plans to dispatch robotaxis in Dallas next year as its driverless expansion races ahead,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/waymo-plans-to-dispatch-robotaxis-in-dallas-next-year-as-its-driverless-expansion-races-ahead-2025-07-28/,"Robotaxi pioneer Waymo has added Dallas to its expanding list of cities where people will be able to request a driverless ride beginning sometime next year in attempt to further distance itself from rivals still scrambling to catch up in the autonomous race. Dallas will become the second major Texas city where Waymo's robotaxis, following the company's move into Austin earlier this year as part of a partnership with ride-hailing leader Uber. Unlike the Austin driverless rides that must be ordered through Uber's app, Waymo will deploy its Dallas robotaxis through its own service and team up with the Avis Budget Group to manage its fleet there. Waymo hasn't set an exact date in 2026 for when its robotaxis will begin cruising through Dallas, which joins Washington D.C. and Miami as cities where the company plans to expand next year. Waymo's robotaxis have already provided more than 250,000 trips in Austin and several other major U.S. cities, including Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Atlanta. As the company continues to expand into new cities, it is pulling even further ahead from the rest of the pack trying to launch driverless ride-hailing services. The aspiring rivals include Tesla, which launched a limited robotaxi service in Austin last month as a prelude to what CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly promised will be a nationwide fleet of driverless cars, even as the automaker faces legal challenges questioning the capability of its autonomous technology.

Waymo plans to dispatch robotaxis in Dallas next year as its driverless expansion races ahead,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/waymo-plans-to-dispatch-robotaxis-in-dallas-next-year-as-its-driverless-expansion-races-ahead-2025-07-28/,"Robotaxi pioneer Waymo has added Dallas to its expanding list of cities where people will be able to request a driverless ride beginning sometime next year in attempt to further distance itself from rivals still scrambling to catch up in the autonomous race. Dallas will become the second major Texas city where Waymo's robotaxis, following the company's move into Austin earlier this year as part of a partnership with ride-hailing leader Uber. Unlike the Austin driverless rides that must be ordered through Uber's app, Waymo will deploy its Dallas robotaxis through its own service and team up with the Avis Budget Group to manage its fleet there. Waymo hasn't set an exact date in 2026 for when its robotaxis will begin cruising through Dallas, which joins Washington D.C. and Miami as cities where the company plans to expand next year. Waymo's robotaxis have already provided more than 250,000 trips in Austin and several other major U.S. cities, including Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Atlanta. As the company continues to expand into new cities, it is pulling even further ahead from the rest of the pack trying to launch driverless ride-hailing services. The aspiring rivals include Tesla, which launched a limited robotaxi service in Austin last month as a prelude to what CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly promised will be a nationwide fleet of driverless cars, even as the automaker faces legal challenges questioning the capability of its autonomous technology.

"Federal Reserve likely to stand pat on rates this week, deepening the gulf between Powell and Trump",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/federal-reserve-likely-to-stand-pat-on-rates-this-week-deepening-the-gulf-between-powell-and-trump-2025-07-28/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve is expected to leave its short-term interest rate unchanged on Wednesday for the fifth straight meeting, a move that will likely underscore the deep divide between how Chair Jerome Powell and his chief critic, President Donald Trump, see the economy. The Fed itself, to be sure, is increasingly divided over its next steps, and many economists expect that two members of the Fed's governing board — both appointed by Trump — could dissent on Wednesday in favor of cutting rates. If so, that would be the first time two governors vote against the chair since 1993. Even so, the gap between the views of the Fed's interest-rate setting committee, chaired by Powell, and the White House is unusually large. In several areas, Trump's views sharply contrast with that of the Fed's leadership, setting up likely clashes for years to come, even after Powell's term as chair ends in May 2026. For example, Trump says that because the U.S. economy is doing well, the Fed should cut rates, as if the U.S. is a blue-chip company that should pay less to borrow than a risky start-up. But Fed officials — and nearly all economists — see it the other way: A solid economy means rates should be relatively high, to prevent overheating and a burst of inflation. “I’d argue that our interest rates are higher because our economy’s doing fairly well, not in spite of it,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, head of U.S. rates strategy at TD Securities. Trump argues that the Fed in general and Powell in particular are costing U.S. taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars in interest payments by not reducing borrowing costs. Yet Fed officials don't think it's their job to reduce rates the government pays on Treasury notes and bonds. Most economists worry that if they did, they would risk failing at one of the key jobs Congress gave them: fighting inflation. “It’s using monetary policy to ease pressure on fiscal policymakers, and that way points to higher inflation and bigger problems down the road,"" said William English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and former senior Fed staffer. If financial markets see that the Fed is focused on keeping borrowing costs low to help the government — rather than focusing on its congressionally-mandated goals of stable prices and maximum employment — Wall Street investors, worried about future inflation, will likely demand higher interest rates to hold Treasury bonds, economists say, pushing up borrowing costs across the economy. For his part, Trump says there is “no inflation” and so the Fed should reduce its short-term rate, currently at about 4.3%, which was ramped up in 2022 and 2023 to fight rising prices. The Fed’s rate often — but not always — influences longer-term borrowing costs for mortgages, car loans, and credit cards. Inflation has fallen sharply and as a result Fed officials have signaled they will cut rates by as much as a half-percentage point this year. Yet it has picked up a bit in the last two months and many of those policymakers, including Powell, still want to make sure that tariffs aren't going to lift inflation much higher before they make a move. Inflation accelerated to 2.7% in June from 2.4% in May, the government said earlier this month, above the Fed's 2% target. Core prices, which exclude the volatile food and energy categories, rose to 2.9% from 2.8%. Last week, Trump and several White House officials ramped up their attacks on Powell over rates. They also criticized the ballooning costs of the Fed's renovation of two of its buildings, raising questions over whether the president was looking to fire Powell for cause rather than policy differences. Trump and Powell engaged in an extraordinary on-camera confrontation over the cost of the project during Trump's visit to the building site last Thursday. On Monday, Trump was more restrained in his comments on the Fed during a joint appearance in London with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. ""I’m not going to say anything bad,” Trump said. “We’re doing so well, even without the rate cut.” But he added, “a smart person would cut."" Some economists expect that the Fed will reduce its key rate by a quarter-point in September, rather than July, and say that the two-month delay will make little difference to the economy. Yet beyond just the timing of the first cut, there is still a huge gulf between what Trump wants and what the Fed will even consider doing: Fed officials in June penciled in just two reductions this year and one in 2026. They forecast that their key rate will still be 3.6% at the end of next year. Trump is pushing them to cut it to just 1%. “That's not going to happen with anything like the current people on the committee,” English said. Wall Street investors also expect relatively few cuts: Two this year and two in 2026, according to futures pricing tracked by CME's Fedwatch. According to the Fed's projections, just two officials in June supported three cuts this year, likely Trump's appointments from his first term: governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman. Waller gave a speech earlier this month supporting a rate reduction in July, but for a very different reason than Trump: He is worried the economy is faltering. “The economy is still growing, but its momentum has slowed significantly, and the risks” of rising unemployment “have increased,” Waller said. Waller has also emphasized that tariffs will create just a one-time bump in prices but won't lead to ongoing inflation. Yet most Fed officials see the job market as relatively healthy — with unemployment at a low 4.1% — and that as a result, they can take time to make sure that's how everything plays out. “Continued overall solid economic conditions enable the Fed to take the time to carefully assess the wide range of incoming data,” said Susan Collins, president of the Boston Federal Reserve. “Thus, in my view, an ‘actively patient’ approach to monetary policy remains appropriate at this time.” Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

Sarepta will resume gene therapy shipments after FDA review of recent patient death,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/sarepta-will-resume-gene-therapy-shipments-after-fda-review-of-recent-patient-death-2025-07-28/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Shares of beleaguered drugmaker Sarepta Therapeutics jumped in afterhours trading Monday after the company said it would resume shipping its gene therapy for some patients, following a brief pause requested by regulators. The Food and Drug Administration said it recommended lifting the hold for young patients with Duchenne’s muscular dystrophy who are still able to walk. Regulators had requested the pause after the deaths of two older teenagers who were taking the therapy. The FDA also said in a statement it determined that a recently reported death of an 8-year-old boy was unrelated to the therapy. Company shares surged more than 16% after the announcement to $13.86 in afterhours trading. The jump is the latest in a series of drastic stock movements triggered by changing fortunes for the company's best-selling product. Elevidys is the first gene therapy approved in the U.S. for Duchenne’s muscular dystrophy, the fatal muscle-wasting disease that affects boys and young men, resulting in early death. It received accelerated approval in 2023 for a narrow range of young patients and was expanded last year for use in older patients, including those who can no longer walk. The FDA decision Monday “significantly improves Elevidys' sales outlook in the near-term,” Jefferies analyst Andrew Tsai told investors, in a note after the announcement. “The street will feel relieved about the situation, suggesting meaningful stock upside potential.” Sarepta's therapy has been under scrutiny from regulators after two teenage boys died earlier this year from acute liver injury, a known side effect of the treatment. The FDA then requested a pause in shipments of the drug after the death of a third patient taking a different Sarepta therapy. FDA officials have suggested the company will need to provide new study data on safety to resume Elevidys' use in older patients. “The FDA will continue to work with the sponsor regarding non-ambulatory patients, which remains subject to a voluntary hold, following two deaths,” FDA said in its statement. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Federal judge blocks Arkansas law barring pharmacy benefit managers from owning pharmacies in state,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/federal-judge-blocks-arkansas-law-barring-pharmacy-benefit-managers-from-owning-pharmacies-in-state-2025-07-28/,"LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — A federal judge temporarily blocked on Monday Arkansas' first-in-the-nation law that would have prohibited pharmacy benefit managers from owning pharmacies in the state. U.S. District Judge Brian Miller issued a preliminary injunction against the law restricting pharmacy benefit managers, who run prescription drug coverage for big clients that include health insurers and employers that provide coverage. Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed the restriction into law earlier this year, and it was set to take effect Aug. 5. CVS and Express Scripts had sued the state over the law. The law, Miller wrote, ""appears to overtly discriminate against plaintiffs as out of state companies and the state has failed to show that it has no other means to advance its interests.” Republican Attorney General Tim Griffin said he respected the court's decision and planned to appeal. Supporters of the Arkansas law have said it’s needed because pharmacy benefit managers are forcing independent pharmacies, especially those in rural areas, to close. CVS and Express Scripts in their lawsuits said the restriction would have devastating effects on consumers if it was allowed to take effect. CVS, which ran TV ads urging Sanders to veto the legislation, has said it would have to close its 23 retail pharmacies in the state if the law takes effect. The company said it was pleased with the decision. “We continue to be focused on serving people in Arkansas and are actively looking to work together with the state to reduce drug prices and ensure access to pharmacies,” CVS said in a statement. Arkansas is among several states where lawmakers have taken up efforts to regulate pharmacy benefit managers. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

Why the American Eagle Stock Rally Isn't Just Speculation,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/why-the-american-eagle-stock-rally-isnt-just-speculation/,"Most investors are familiar with the term “meme mania”, where companies with dubious fundamentals rally as if there were several strong fundamental reasons to push any given stock to new market capitalizations. Ultimately, there are no solid foundations to sustain these prices and valuations. In today’s all-time high S&P 500 index, there are a few new waves of this so-called mania rally. However, suppose there is one name in particular that this behavior has influenced, but one that can carry enough fundamental factors to sustain these higher prices. In that case, that stock is American Eagle Outfitters Inc. NYSE: AEO. Even though the retail sector has been relatively quiet lately, with new trade tariff negotiations by President Trump acting as a source of uncertainty and volatility in this space, there is still enough potential in this stock for investors to consider. Some of these are rooted in financial metrics themselves, others in the way that the broader market is looking at this stock, from a valuation and earnings per share (EPS) growth point of view, investors are often rewarded by understanding the logic behind the market placement of these companies, and when it comes to American Eagle stock, a recent rally is far from being just a meme. After rallying up to 7% to end the last week of July 2025, American Eagle stock sparked some speculative interest after actress Sydney Sweeney partnered with the brand for a marketing piece. This event has absolutely no impact on the company's financials; sentiment, however, is a different story. Having more exposure to the financial community can be beneficial, as more investors who may have forgotten about this company in the noise may return to revisit a new thesis. This is where attention could meet proper investment methodology, and where American Eagle’s financials also come into play. Before investors understand what makes American Eagle stand out, they need to know that this $2 billion company is the smallest among its peer group, including names like Abercrombie & Fitch Co. NYSE: ANF and The Gap Inc. NYSE: GAP. Being the smallest name creates an asymmetric setup when it comes to risk versus reward, something buyers will like. While the rest of the market focuses on how increased tariffs may affect margins in the retail sector, savvy investors can focus on the fact that American Eagle carries one of the highest gross profit margins in the apparel industry, reaching a high of 37% over the past 12 months. Of course, this is impressive not only on a comparable basis but even more so given the company's small $2 billion market capitalization, which should theoretically make it harder for the business to navigate market share and pricing power enough to generate such high margin rates. With this in mind, there is one slight anomaly in the company’s most recent quarterly earnings results. While net income and earnings per share are typically in line with the broader gross profit dominance, the past quarter threw management off, as new tariff deals and announcements were being made. When examining the cash flow statement more closely, investors can notice that management shifted over $40 million worth of inventory compared to the same summer season last year, a significant cash outlay in response to potential pricing hikes during tariff implementations that tilted the balance away from usual net EPS growth. However, examining different market gauges can be beneficial for investors, particularly in identifying where Wall Street analysts anticipate the underlying financials and valuations will head shortly. For starters, today’s low price of only 50% of its 52-week high makes American Eagle one of the most discounted names in apparel, leaving high expectations. Some of these expectations, such as the consensus price target set by Wall Street analysts, point to a valuation of up to $ 14.70 per share for American Eagle. This view suggests a potential 24% increase for the stock to reach its 52-week highs and possibly enter new territory. A tailwind pushing behind these expectations is the $0.46 EPS forecast set by analysts for the fourth quarter of 2025, a tremendous jump compared to today’s net loss per share of $0.29. This view also reinforces that the current quarter is outside the norm for American Eagle, indicating a return to normalized operations and higher valuations. All told, while the recent rally was driven by some of the “meme mania” characteristics, the fundamentals are in place to keep the stock near these higher prices, if not to reach a new 52-week high before the year is over.

"D-Wave, SuperQ, and Verge: A New Path Forward for Quantum?",https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/d-wave-superq-and-verge-a-new-path-forward-for-quantum/,"Finally breaking above $20 per share in mid-July, quantum computing giant D-Wave Quantum Inc. NYSE: QBTS extended its rally as it touched new all-time highs. As shares have nearly doubled in value year-to-date (YTD), investors will undoubtedly be watching the company's early-August earnings for clues about its ongoing commercialization efforts. There are plenty of reasons to be optimistic—over a quarter of surveyed business leaders expect a quantum investment to provide an ROI of more than $5 million in the first year, with another 46% anticipating ROI between $1 million and $5 million. This suggests a bullish customer base ready to spend heartily on quantum technology that could transform industries. D-Wave's major sales in recent quarters have been entire quantum computing systems, including the first sale of its Advantage system in the first quarter of 2025. But a partnership with another quantum firm—Canada's SuperQ Quantum Computing Inc. and agricultural software firm Verge Ag—may provide insight into how D-Wave's product lineup may expand in the future. D-Wave first announced its collaboration with SuperQ and Verge in February 2025, but the partnership made headlines again in July thanks to the realization of the first related revenue contract, which was earned from Verge. The purpose of the collaboration between these three companies was to utilize quantum annealing, the technology for which D-Wave is best known, to aid in developing Verge's Launch Pad platform. Specifically, D-Wave's tech is used to help create optimized plans for the movement of robots across thousands of agricultural fields simultaneously. This is exactly the type of project for which quantum annealing is ideally suited, given the technology's ability to evaluate a large number of possibilities and determine the optimal choice. Notably, D-Wave has faced criticism from analysts and investors who believe that quantum annealing may not be as fruitful an area of the quantum computing landscape as some alternatives. In fact, criticism of annealing and its potential compared to other approaches, such as gate-model quantum architecture, was a major feature of a popular short seller's argument against the company advanced earlier this year by Kerrisdale Capital. The fact that this collaboration has yielded its first revenue contract and that annealing tech was particularly well-suited to making this project possible are points in favor of D-Wave and its unique quantum focus. Besides being an effective proof of concept for quantum annealing, D-Wave's collaboration provides a model for driving future revenue. So far, D-Wave has depended on just a few high-profile sales of its computing systems to grow its revenue. However, organizations positioned to benefit from owning a massive and expensive quantum computing setup are relatively small in number, such as city and regional governments, large university systems, and similarly sized entities. Though no direct customer partnered with D-Wave to commission the agricultural project with SuperQ and Verge, the companies have still managed to find interest among buyers. D-Wave could continue to work alongside similar partners across various sectors, leveraging industry-specific products and expertise alongside annealing tech to create previously unattainable products. This latest project even shows the potential benefits of partnering with peers in the quantum computing space. Quantum stocks continue to race higher, but marketability remains a crucial concern. Few of these companies have logged substantial sales or demonstrated the capacity to grow revenue. Investors should keep this in mind, despite D-Wave's tendency to bounce upward on positive news. After all, the firm showed some warning signs in its first-quarter earnings, including a drop in deferred revenue by about two-thirds, an adjusted EBITDA loss, and a sizable cash burn approaching $20 million. This may help to explain why short interest in QBTS shares represents an eye-popping 20.5%, even as all nine analyst ratings of the stock are Buys. Investors may want to watch D-Wave closely for signs that the company is open to expanding its path toward increased revenue through further partnerships like the one with SuperQ and Verge. Doing so would likely open up important avenues for growth. Before you consider D-Wave Quantum, you'll want to hear this.

4 Stocks Planning to Substantially Boost Buybacks After Solid Q2,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/4-stocks-planning-to-substantially-boost-buybacks-after-solid-q2/,"With Q2 earnings season now in full swing, hundreds of companies have reported financial results over the past several weeks. However, only a few big names have announced something many investors want: increasing buybacks. This can occur through boosting buyback authorizations or raising forecasts for buyback spending. Both mean that a company’s outstanding share count will likely decrease over time. This can provide a tailwind to its adjusted earnings per share (EPS), as each dollar of earnings is spread over fewer shares. This helps put upward pressure on their share prices. Below, we’ll detail four names that, after reporting solid earnings, significantly boosted their share buyback authorizations or buyback spending intentions. First up is financial services giant Charles Schwab NYSE: SCHW. The company reported earnings on July 18 and beat estimates on both sales and adjusted EPS by solid margins. As a result, shares climbed approximately 3% over the following trading session. Then, on July 24, Schwab announced a massive increase in its share buyback capacity. On June 30, the company’s buyback capacity stood at around $6.9 billion. The company has now replaced this with a new $20 billion buyback authorization, nearly tripling its buyback capacity. This $20 billion in buyback capacity equals a massive 11.3% of its market capitalization. This allows the firm to lower its share count over the coming quarters and years. Next is homebuilding behemoth D.R. Horton NYSE: DHI. Shares surged nearly 17% after the company reported its fiscal Q3 2025 earnings on July 22. The firm crushed sales and adjusted EPS estimates, making “solid” an understatement when describing the firm’s latest results. D.R. Horton did not officially increase its total buyback capacity. However, the company did detail its intentions to repurchase more shares in fiscal 2025 than it previously forecasted. The company now expects to spend between $4.2 billion and $4.4 billion on buybacks, up from $4 billion. In some sense, that announcement is better than an increase in buyback capacity. Announcing an increase in capacity doesn’t mean a company will use it. D.R. Horton’s statements show that it will spend more, even if its capacity hasn’t increased. The statement indicates that D.R. Horton intends to reduce its share count by another 1.4% to 1.9% next quarter. This comes after the firm reduced its outstanding share count by 9% over the past three quarters. One of the biggest banks in the world, Bank of America NYSE: BAC, also just provided a massive shot in the arm to its buyback capacity. Its new buyback authorization comes in at $40 billion, replacing its previous authorization of $9.1 billion. The $40 billion in buyback capacity is equal to around 11.1% of the firm’s market capitalization, a significant number. This comes after the company reported solid earnings on July 16. It beat estimates on adjusted EPS but missed slightly on sales. Shares were essentially flat the day after the report. However, shares are up around 5% since reporting as of the July 25 close, indicating that markets saw the results as more favorable after digesting them. Last up is Teledyne Technologies NYSE: TDY. The approximately $26 billion tech firm reported its Q2 financial results on July 23. The company posted record revenue of $1.5 billion and beat sales and adjusted EPS estimates. Shares fell slightly on the results, but Wall Street price target updates indicate that this was not warranted. UBS Group raised its price target from $585 to $630 after the results. That target implies around 13% upside in shares. Along with reporting financial results, Teledyne announced a new $2 billion buyback authorization. This replaces its previous authorization, which had $896 million remaining, doubling its buyback capacity. The firm’s new capacity equals 7.7% of its market capitalization. These big-name firms aren’t just posting strong earnings—they’re making bold moves to return capital to shareholders.

It’s moo-ving day for dairy cattle at Michigan State University,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/its-moo-ving-day-for-dairy-cattle-at-michigan-state-university-2025-07-28/,"EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Dozens of dairy cattle were on the moo-ve Monday at Michigan State University. About 80 cows hoofed it to their new home, the Dairy Cattle Teaching and Research Center, a $75 million facility the East Lansing school says will allow agriculture, veterinary and other students to learn on a modern farm that’s equipped to replicate the most high-tech operations in the world. George Smith, who heads up Michigan State’s AgBioResearch department, called it a “21st century cattle drive.” Crews erected a fence between the two buildings and herded the animals via claps, calls and whistles. The remaining 180 cows are expected to be herded to the new building on Tuesday. Michigan’s dairy industry leads the nation in milk production per cow, according to Smith, adding dairy also is the No. 1 contributor to the state’s agricultural economy. The new complex is significantly larger than the existing dairy farm, which was constructed in the 1960s and was so limited in space and equipment that researchers have a backlog of up to two years on funded projects. The existing MSU Dairy Cattle Teaching and Research Center currently houses 250 dairy cattle and supports the research of faculty in the colleges of Agriculture and Natural Resources and Veterinary Medicine. The new facility features a 165,000-square-foot cattle barn that will expand research capacity by increasing herd size to 680. Those cows will arrive in batches in the coming weeks and months. The new space also includes modernized barns, feed centers, milking parlors and labs. “Our old facility didn’t have the technical capabilities to be able to train our students for what to expect when they graduated, what dairy cattle production looks like today,” Kim Dodd, dean of the College of Veterinary Medicine, said Monday. The new digs are opening at a time when other land grant universities in the agricultural Midwest are scrapping their dairy cattle teaching programs. “While other institutions are disinvesting in dairy programs, we are investing in the future of the dairy industry in the state of Michigan, because it’s so critical to the state’s agricultural economy,” Smith said. A $30 million investment by the State of Michigan provided the initial funding for the 18-month project, with the rest being contributed by alumni, donors and stakeholders in the dairy industry. “Who doesn’t love ice cream,” Smith said. “Who can’t get excited about new opportunities in the field of dairy science?” Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

Trump is getting the world economy he wants — but the risk to growth could spoil his victory lap,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-is-getting-the-world-economy-he-wants----but-the-risk-to-growth-could-spoil-his-victory-lap-2025-07-28/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is getting his way with the world economy. Trading partners from the European Union to Japan to Vietnam appear to be acceding to the president’s demands to accept higher costs — in the form of high tariffs — for the privilege of selling their wares to the United States. For Trump, the agreements, driven by a mix of threats and cajoling, are a fulfillment of a decades-long belief in protectionism and a massive gamble that it will pay off politically and economically with American consumers. On Sunday, the United States and the 27-member state European Union announced that they had reached a trade framework agreement: The EU agreed to accept 15% U.S. tariffs on most of its goods, easing fears of a catastrophic trans-Atlantic trade war. There were also commitments by the EU to buy $750 billion in U.S. energy products and make $600 billion in new investments through 2028, according to the White House. “We just signed a very big trade deal, the biggest of them all,” Trump said Monday. But there’s no guarantee that Trump’s radical overhaul of U.S. trade policy will deliver the happy ending he’s promised. The framework agreement was exceedingly sparse on details. Most trade deals require months and even years of painstaking negotiation that rise and fall on granular details. Financial markets, at first panicked by the president’s protectionist agenda, seem to have acquiesced to a world in which U.S. import taxes — tariffs — are at the highest rates they’ve been in roughly 90 years. Several billion in new revenues from his levies on foreign goods are pouring into the U.S. Treasury and could somewhat offset the massive tax cuts he signed into law on July 4. Outside economists say that high tariffs are still likely to raise prices for American consumers, dampen the Federal Reserve's ability to lower interest rates, and make the U.S. economy less efficient over time. Democrats say the middle class and poor will ultimately pay for the tariffs. “It’s pretty striking that it’s seen as a sigh of relief moment,” said Daniel Hornung, a former Biden White House economic official who now holds fellowships at Housing Finance Policy Center and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “But if the new baseline across all trading partners is 15%, that is a meaningful drag on growth that increases recession risks, while simultaneously making it harder for the Fed to cut.” The EU agreement came just four days after Japan also agreed to 15% U.S. tariffs and to invest in the United States. Earlier, the United States reached deals that raised tariffs on imports from Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines and the United Kingdom considerably from where they'd been before Trump returned to the White House. More one-sided trade deals are likely as countries try to beat a Friday deadline, after which Trump will impose even higher tariffs on countries that refuse to make concessions. The U.S. president has long claimed that America erred by not taking advantage of its clout as the world's biggest economy and erecting a wall of tariffs, in effect making other countries ante up for access to America's massive consumer market. To his closest aides, Trump's use of tariffs has validated their trust in his skills as a negotiator and their belief that the economists who warned of downturns and inflation were wrong. The S&P 500 stock index was basically flat on Monday, but stocks have more than recovered from the tariff-induced selloff in April. “Where are the ‘experts’ now?” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick posted on X. But the story is not over. For one thing, many of the details of Trump's trade deals remain somewhat hazy and have not been captured in writing. The U.S. and Japan, for instance, have offered differing descriptions of Japan's agreement to invest $550 billion in the United States. “The trade deals do seem to count as a qualified win for Trump, with other countries giving the U.S. favorable trade terms while accepting U.S. tariffs,” said Eswar Prasad, a Cornell University economist. ""However, certain terms of the deals, such as other countries’ investments in the U.S., seem more promising in the abstract than they might prove in reality over time.'' Trump is also facing a court challenge from states and businesses arguing that the president overstepped his authority by declaring national emergencies to justify the tariffs on most of the world's economies. In May, a federal court struck down those tariffs. And an appeals court, which agreed to let the government continue collecting the tariffs for now, will hear oral arguments in the case Thursday. And he's yet to reach an accord with China — which has deftly used the threat of retaliatory tariffs and withholding exports of rare earth minerals that are desperately needed for electric vehicles, computer chips and wind turbines to avoid caving in to Trump's demands. The U.S. and China are talking this week in Stockholm, Sweden. There is also skepticism that tariffs will produce the economic boom claimed by Trump. Analysts at Morgan Stanley said “the most likely outcome is slow growth and firm inflation,” but not a recession. After all, the 15% tariffs on the EU and Japan are a slight increase from the 10% rate that Trump began charging in April during a negotiation period. While autos made in the EU and Japan will no longer face the 25% tariffs Trump had imposed, they will still face a 15% tax that has yet to appear in prices at U.S. dealerships. The administration has said the lack of auto price increases suggests that foreign producers are absorbing the costs, but it might ultimately just reflect the buildup of auto inventories to front-run the import taxes. “Dealers built stocks ahead of tariff implementation, damping the immediate impact on retail prices. That cushion is starting to wear thin,” Morgan Stanley said in a separate note. “Our Japan auto analyst notes that as pre-tariff inventory clears, replacement vehicles will likely carry higher price tags.” Economist Mary Lovely of the Peterson Institute for International Economics warned of a “slow-burn efficiency loss’’ as U.S. companies scramble to adjust to Trump’s new world. For decades, American companies have mostly paid the same tariffs – and often none at all – on imported machinery and raw materials from all over the world. Now, as a result of Trump’s trade deals, tariffs vary by country. “U.S. firms have to change their designs and get inputs from different places based on these variable tariff rates,’’ she said. “It’s an incredible administrative burden. There’s all these things that are acting as longer-term drags on economy, but their effect will show up only slowly.’’ Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, said that the United States’ effective tariff rate has risen to 17.5% from around 2.5% at the start of the year. “I wouldn’t take a victory lap,'' Zandi said. ”The economic damage caused by the higher tariffs will mount in the coming months.'' ___ Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

3 Reasons Tesla's Post-Earnings Hangover Looks Like a Buy,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/3-reasons-teslas-post-earnings-hangover-looks-like-a-buy/,"After a big earnings report last Wednesday, shares of Tesla Inc. NASDAQ: TSLA ended last week down 5% from their pre-earnings high. That might sound bearish, but context is everything. The stock had been rallying pretty steadily into Wednesday's report, and had gained 50% since April. So the pullback, especially one that started to reverse before the week even ended, feels more like a reset than a rejection. That being said, at one point in the immediate aftermath of the earnings release, it looked like things could get ugly. The report showed revenue down almost 12% year-over-year, and it wasn't a blowout beat by any means. But with earnings landing in line at 40 cents per share and margins up compared to Q1, the results came in better than feared. More importantly, the bears lost momentum almost immediately. By Friday evening, though, the stock had bounced off a key trendline, the lower edge of a narrowing pennant formation developing since April. This technical pattern, which typically resolves with a breakout, is looking increasingly bullish now that earnings are out of the way and the uptrend remains intact. The next move could be sharp and directional, and right now, the bulls look better positioned. Let's look at why this pullback might actually be a solid buy. Tesla's headline numbers were far from stellar, but they didn't disappoint either. Revenue still declined, but not by as much as expected, non-GAAP earnings held steady, and vehicle deliveries for Q2 were up on Q1. Many investors would have been bracing for a disaster, but what they got was something actually quite manageable, even optimistic in parts. Margins improved, deliveries bounced, and the company reiterated that its next-gen affordable EV is still on track for the second half of 2025. The fear trade that had driven volatility earlier in the year appears to be in the process of being replaced by cautious optimism. With the stock up already in the early part of Monday's session, there's a sense that much of the worst-case scenario is now built into the base case. Despite the pullback, Tesla remains in a clearly defined uptrend, with its multi-month series of higher lows and higher highs intact. The stock bounced exactly where you'd expect it to last week, on the lower boundary of the narrowing pennant we've been tracking, and rallied through Friday to close well off the post-earnings lows. In the early part of Monday's session, shares were up close to 4% and edging towards their pre-earnings level. This pattern tells us the bulls are not done yet. With the near-term uncertainty around Q2 earnings removed, a breakout towards the $360 mark could soon be in play. Technicals aside, many analysts have remained firmly bullish. Wedbush, for example, is holding firm on its $500 price target, with analyst Dan Ives pointing to the company's $1 trillion autonomy opportunity as a key driver of long-term value. The team at Canaccord Genuity Group also came out bullish after last week's report, reiterating its Buy rating and boosting its price target to $333. Love or hate him, Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk, still knows how to command attention. Wednesday's report may have lacked fireworks, but Musk's comments on Tesla's autonomy roadmap are worth noting. He reaffirmed plans for the robotaxi rollout to reach half of the U.S. population by the end of 2025 and hinted at European regulatory progress. For the naysayers out there, these aren't just PR stunts. Instead, they reflect Tesla's ongoing pivot away from hardware-driven growth and towards a software-and-services model, one with the potential for that much sought-after recurring, high-margin revenue. The sell-off, such as it was, feels like a short-term shakeout. Sure, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is still lofty, sitting north of 180, meaning expectations are still high. But Tesla doesn't need to be perfect to keep moving higher. It just needs to keep progressing, quarter by quarter. A move back towards $340 is very much on the cards in the coming sessions, and would likely represent a major breakout signal for investors. After all, this is the same stock that rallied 60% after a horrible Q1 report. If that can happen after a miss, imagine what's possible after a beat.

Trump seeks quick Murdoch deposition in Wall Street Journal lawsuit over Epstein story,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-seeks-quick-murdoch-deposition-in-wall-street-journal-lawsuit-over-epstein-story-2025-07-28/,"President Donald Trump is asking a federal court in Florida to force Rupert Murdoch to give a deposition for the president's lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal within 15 days, citing the media mogul's age and physical condition. Trump sued the Journal, owned by Murdoch, in the U.S. District Court of southern Florida on July 18 for its story reporting on the Republican president's ties to Jeffrey Epstein, the financier and alleged child sex trafficker who died in a New York jail in 2019 before trial. The president's motion to the court on Monday noted Murdoch is 94 years old, is believed to have suffered several health scares in recent years, and is presumed to live in New York. “Taken together, these factors weigh heavily in determining that Murdoch would be unavailable for in-person testimony at trial,” Trump's request to the court said. A spokesman for Murdoch's News Corp. did not immediately return a request for comment. Trump's motion said that, in a telephone conversation, Murdoch's lawyer indicated he would oppose the effort. ___ Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

"Wallis Annenberg, billionaire philanthropist who backed arts, science and other causes, dies at 86",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/wallis-annenberg-billionaire-philanthropist-who-backed-arts-science-and-other-causes-dies-at-86-2025-07-28/,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Wallis Annenberg, the billionaire philanthropist who supported the arts, science, education and animal welfare causes over decades in Los Angeles, died Monday, her family said. She was 86. Annenberg died at home from complications related to lung cancer, the family said in a statement to the Los Angeles Times. “Wallis transitioned peacefully and comfortable this morning to her new adventure,” the statement said. “Cancer may have beaten her body but it never got her spirit. We will hold her and her wisdom in our hearts forever.” Her name adorns institutions across the Los Angeles area, including the Wallis Annenberg Building at the California Science Center, the Wallis Annenberg GenSpace senior center and the Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts. The Wallis Annenberg Wildlife Crossing, the world's largest bridge for animals on the move, will open next year over an LA freeway. During her 16-year tenure as president and chief executive of the Annenberg Foundation, the nonprofit organization has donated about $1.5 billion to thousands of organizations in Southern California, the Times reported. Under Wallis Annenberg's leadership, the foundation expanded its philanthropic scope beyond media, arts and education to include animal welfare, environmental conservation and healthcare. Her father, Walter Annenberg, started the foundation after selling his publishing empire, including TV Guide and other publications, in 1989 to Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp. Walter Annenberg died in 2002. Wallis Annenberg was a longtime board member of LA's Museum of Contemporary Art and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, or LACMA. In 2002, she gave $10 million to endow LACMA’s director position. “Wallis Annenberg blessed the Los Angeles community not only with her philanthropy, but also with her guidance about how to improve our community,” said LACMA Chief Executive Michael Govan, who filled that endowed position in 2006. Born in Philadelphia, she moved to Los Angeles in the early 1970s after marrying neurosurgeon Seth Weingarten. The couple divorced in 1975. Wallis Annenberg received the 2022 National Humanities Medal from President Joe Biden for her life in philanthropy. She is survived by four children and five grandchildren.

Taiwan Semiconductor Could Boom on This AI Action Plan,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/taiwan-semiconductor-could-boom-on-this-ai-action-plan/,"The world of technology stocks has become somewhat of the Wild West in the stock market, with new artificial intelligence companies constantly emerging in this ongoing race for dominance and adoption. Meanwhile, larger, more established players are taking over the supply and market share of the world’s leading chipmaking and semiconductor technologies. Of course, there is one broader agenda at play in this proverbial “gold rush,” and that is that the United States is now in direct competition with China in this new artificial intelligence race. That is why President Trump has recently introduced America’s AI Action Plan, a bill that has just introduced a massive tailwind for all names involved in this value chain. With new funding allocated to data center infrastructure, enabling greater global artificial intelligence development and capacity sharing, it is now time for investors to seriously consider a company like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing NYSE: TSM as a key player in supporting this data center expansion and the future onshoring of semiconductor and chip manufacturing within the United States. One of the most concerning aspects of the current chip and artificial intelligence race is the United States' position relative to China, as past trade tariff negotiations seemed to focus heavily on this industry and China’s ability to import certain chips, such as those from NVIDIA Corporation NASDAQ: NVDA. However, in this new AI Action Plan, President Trump has permitted China to import NVIDIA chips. This sudden shift unexpectedly favors Taiwan Semiconductor more than NVIDIA, despite what may seem like a controversy. The reason is that NVIDIA relies on Taiwan Semiconductor for its manufacturing and wafer equipment. As China is also aggressively developing its artificial intelligence and data center footprint, this freedom in the AI Action Plan could represent a massive tailwind for Taiwan Semiconductor stock, which might be why the market has sent the name up to a new 52-week high, not to mention delivering a net rally of up to 48.5% over the past quarter alone. Despite this recent bullish price action, there still seems to be a lot of momentum left in the stock. Fundamentally, investors could argue that an even higher ceiling could be reached in the coming months. Another section of this action plan finds the reasoning behind this new potential ceiling. Focusing on exports and artificial intelligence deregulation, the following sections of this plan accelerate how business in the artificial intelligence world used to be done. This opens up the floodgates for faster model development, demand for more advanced chips, and, of course, a fast pass to data center volume. With this in mind, the graphics processing units (GPUs) enable this to happen in the first place, and most of the industry obtains them from NVIDIA itself. Remembering that no NVIDIA is without Taiwan Semiconductor will help investors connect the dots in the current industry scene. And investors aren’t the only ones connecting the dots. Wall Street analysts seem to be already getting behind this theme for semiconductor names, with a particular interest in Taiwan Semiconductor stock. Charles Shi from Needham & Company is one of the leading analysts to share his optimism as of mid-July 2025. With a new Buy rating on Taiwan Semiconductor stock, alongside a valuation target of $270 per share, Shi has now placed the highest valuation on this company out of his peer group, calling for not only a new 52-week high to be made but also implying that Taiwan Semiconductor stock could deliver up to 10.2% upside from where it trades today. Of course, this price target was already set before the action plan was introduced, so chances are a new analyst rating (likely with a higher valuation) will trickle in shortly. However, at that time, the stock might react so quickly to the news that it renders the announcement worthless. In other words, there is a window of opportunity in Taiwan Semiconductor stock that is quickly closing, and the serious intent behind this new plan could be only the beginning of an additional series of measures to ensure the United States stays ahead in the artificial intelligence race, where Taiwan Semiconductor plays a vital role.

A small Serbian town is home to Robin Hood — in a new TV series,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/a-small-serbian-town-is-home-to-robin-hood--in-a-new-tv-series-2025-07-28/,"SIMANOVCI, Serbia (AP) — Villages and castles from 12th-century England came to life in a small town in Serbia for the filming of a new series about Robin Hood that has just wrapped in the landlocked country in southeast Europe. The 10-episode take on England’s beloved medieval outlaw who, in lore, stole from the rich to give to the poor, comes from Lionsgate Television, and is expected to premiere on MGM+ in the U.S. and parts of Europe later this year. The Associated Press recently visited the set in Simanovci, the village which is home to a film studio and not far from the capital of Belgrade. Thorough research for the series was visible in the scenography and costumes, taking the cast — and the studio — back in time to the stony interiors of a candlelit castle, complete with stained-glass lancet windows. The “sweeping, romantic adventure” offers a historically grounded look into how Robin Hood grew up to become an outlaw-turned-hero in the wake of the Norman conquest of England, the producers say. “We actually show the beginning of Robin Hood,” producer, director and writer Jonathan English, who was a main driving force behind the project, said in an interview. “We start the story with him as a child.” Self-described as a “huge fan of all things medieval,” English marveled at Robin Hood's persistent global appeal. “You can stop a pensioner on the streets of Belgrade and he knows who Robin Hood is. You can stop a teenager on the streets of Beijing, and they know who Robin Hood is,” he said. Asked whether the story is still relevant, following countless cinematic and small-screen adaptations, English insisted that “it is incredibly relevant, probably more today than ... 50 years ago or 100 years ago, even.” “It’s a story about class and the absolute tyranny of class, people who believe that they can have everything and control everything and can own everything and everybody else could just, you know, get lost,” he said. “There’s always been wealthy people, but now you have uber-rich people. And the divide between the uber-rich and the rest of the world is extraordinary now.” The show’s plot centers strongly on the romance between Robin and Marian. He is a Saxon forester’s son and Marian is the daughter of a Norman lord but they overcome the divide to jointly fight for freedom and against injustice. Australian actor Jack Patten plays Robin, joined by Lauren McQueen as Marian. The two appear alongside Sean Bean as the notorious Sheriff of Nottingham, and Connie Nielsen, who plays Eleanor of Aquitaine, the queen of England and wife of Henry II. Patten admitted he was nervous ahead of his “third gig since getting out of drama school.” His Robin is “any young 24-year-old ... trying to find his place in the world” and who “gets dealt some pretty tricky cards.” McQueen said Marian's character will be “quite empowering” for young women watching the series. Filmed in multiple locations in Serbia and with hundreds of staff and crew, the series is “huge” even by Hollywood standards, showrunner and writer John Glenn said. He described the new show as “much more Peaky Blinders in tone” than previous incarnations, referring to the hit U.K. TV series about gangsters in 1920s Birmingham. Both Glenn and English said they chose Serbia because of high-standard facilities and crews but also because of the natural scenery that could mimic a medieval English landscape. “It’s hard to find ancient forests now in England,” English said. “There’s not a lot of undeveloped wilderness.""

Meta's Q2 Earnings: Key Areas Investors Must Pay Attention To,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/metas-q2-earnings-key-areas-investors-must-pay-attention-to/,"Magnificent Seven stock Meta Platforms' NASDAQ: META Q2 earnings report is quickly approaching, and, as always, it is a highly anticipated event. That sentiment may ring true now more than ever, as Meta has made aggressive moves over the last several months to alter its AI strategy. Notably, Meta shares are getting upgraded significantly by Wall Street analysts coming into the release. As of the July 24 close, the MarketBeat consensus price target on Meta is around $752, implying only around 5% upside. However, among Wall Street updates released in July, the average price target is nearly $782. This implies over 9% upside and raises the stakes for Meta in Q2. Below, we’ll detail some of the top items investors should pay attention to in Meta’s Q2 results, which the company will release on July 30. The company’s core business remains the most critical focus for Meta: advertising. Thus, investors will surely want to see strength in this part of the business to drive sales and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) that meet or exceed analyst expectations. Meta trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 28x, just below its high over the past three years of 29x. It may take fairly substantial beats for shares to ride higher. Other underlying metrics will help gauge Meta’s advertising business's health. One is growth in ad impressions delivered, which shows how many more ads Meta users saw. This growth rate ticked down from 10% in Q2 2024 to 5% in Q1 2025. It would be nice to see Meta hold the line at 5% growth due to this recent decline. This would indicate that user engagement gains are not trailing off, which is key for increasing the value of Meta’s ad surfaces. Investors will want to see Meta’s price paid per ad growth stay in the 10% range, plus or minus a couple of percentage points. This will indicate that competition among advertisers continues to increase, thus raising the prices paid to Meta. It would also show that Meta's returns from its AI investments in advertising are not diminishing. Given that these metrics have been significant drivers of Meta’s rally, continued strength is important to the rally's continuation. It will also be important to see what kind of tariff-related impacts Meta sees on its advertising business going forward. In Q1, the impacts were relatively subdued. However, Trump’s tariff policy is slowly becoming more concrete, with reciprocal tariffs set to take effect on Aug. 1. The 145% reciprocal tariffs on China only lasted for around a month, but they could have resulted in a temporary negative impact on Meta’s business in Q2. Details on that impact could provide insight into how tariff-resistant Meta’s business really is. Seeing some kind of progress in Meta’s Reality Labs segment will also be important. Last quarter, sales fell 6%. Meta wants to sell millions more of its smart glasses in 2025 than it did in 2024. Seeing Reality Labs return to growth this quarter will be key to the firm actually achieving this. Lastly, analysts will likely focus a lot of their attention on Meta’s AI strategy, which the company is augmenting through the creation of Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL). The company is doling out massive salaries to hire the best people in AI at MSL. Alexandr Wang, whom Meta essentially spent $14.3 billion on to join the firm, is the clearest example of this. Understanding Meta’s AI vision, with Wang leading the charge, is key to the outlook on the firm. Investors should look for Meta to strike a strong balance between near- to mid-term AI monetization and long-term AI leadership. The company wants to make money with AI today, with opportunities like advertising automation and WhatsApp business messaging at the forefront. However, it also needs to stay competitive in developing general artificial intelligence in the long term. Commentary on how the company is shifting its approach, including the possibility of moving away from open-source AI models, will be key to watch. Overall, the points detailed above provide a largely comprehensive view of what to watch for regarding Meta in Q2. We’ll circle back after the results to understand how well Meta on these fronts and cover other key details the company focused on in its earnings call.

Reaction to the European Union's trade agreement with the Trump administration,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/a-raw-deal-but-the-best-they-could-get-with-trump-europe-dismayed-and-relieved-at-the-same-time-2025-07-28/,"FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The European Union’s trade agreement with the Trump administration is getting mixed reviews. EU officials say they warded off a total economic disaster. But French officials in particular say the EU punched below its weight while economists say the deal is dangerously vague. The deal leaves Europe with a 15% tariff on most goods imported into the U.S., with some goods categories tariff-free, but no agreement on rates for key areas such as pharmaceuticals and steel. Here is what they're saying: Failing to reach a deal by the Aug. 1 deadline would have meant a 30% tariff threatened by U.S. President Donald Trump, EU chief trade negotiator Maroš Šefčovič said. The main aim of European officials was a negotiated agreement, rather than a tit-for-tat escalation that could have included retaliatory EU tariffs on 93 billion euros ($108 billion) worth of goods, including U.S. agricultural products, steel and chemicals. “A trade war may seem appealing to some, but it comes with serious consequences, with at least a 30% tariff,"" Šefčovič said. “Our trans-Atlantic trade would effectively come to a halt, putting close to 5 million jobs, including those in SMEs (small- and medium-sized enterprises) in Europe, at grave risk. “Our businesses have sent us a unanimous message: avoid escalation and work towards a solution that delivers immediate relief,” he said. Major exports to the U.S.: Aircraft, pharmaceuticals, luxury perfumes and leather goods, wine and spirits. Senior French officials on Monday criticized the accord, with Foreign Trade Minister Laurent Saint-Martin urging a European response in the services sector, and Strategy Commissioner Clément Beaune warning it underplayed the 27-nation bloc’s economic strength. “The good news is that there is an agreement — our companies now have visibility and stability in the trans-Atlantic trade relationship,” Saint-Martin said on France Inter radio. “But this agreement is not balanced, and we will need to keep working."" He pointed to digital services as a key front in the trade imbalance. “Donald Trump spent months saying he wanted to rebalance a trade relationship that disadvantages the United States, but he was only talking about goods. If we look at services, it’s the opposite. So it’s up to us now to carry out the work of force and rebalancing,” he said. “The United States decided to use force to impose a new law of the jungle that no longer respects the rules of international trade that we had for decades,” Saint-Martin said. Beaune, France’s high commissioner for strategy and planning, said on franceinfo radio that “this is an unequal and unbalanced agreement.” He warned that “Europe did not wield its strength. We are the world’s leading trading power.” “When you look at it, the glass is a quarter full and three-quarters empty,” Beaune said. Prime Minister François Bayrou was even more scathing, posting on X: “It is a dark day when an alliance of free peoples, united to uphold their values and defend their interests, resigns itself to submission.” Major exports to the U.S.: Motor vehicles, pharmaceuticals and industrial machinery. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said that the deal would give companies a more predictable environment to plan and invest — a key EU goal after weeks of back-and-forth threats in tense talks with Trump administration officials. “It is good that Europe and the USA have agreed and thus avoided an unnecessary escalation in trans-Atlantic trade relations,"" he said. ""We have been able to preserve our core interests, even if I would have very much wished for further relief in trans-Atlantic trade.” Asked about negative reactions to the deal from German business, Merz countered that it was met with relief by some companies and sectors. However, “it is completely clear to me that the tariffs that now remain — in particular the 15% against 0% for imports to the European Union — constitute a significant burden for the export-oriented economy of the Federal Republic of Germany,” Merz said, noting that he had said repeatedly before the agreement that “there will be an asymmetric deal, if there is one at all.” Major exports to the U.S.: Industrial machinery, cars and agricultural products. Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, who has positioned herself as a “bridge” between the Trump administration and Europe, welcomed news of the tariff agreement as a “positive” outcome that avoided an “unpredictable and potentially devastating” trade war. But in comments to reporters on the sidelines of a U.N. food security conference in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, she said that details still needed to be worked out and that she's still unclear what exemptions are carved out for particular industries. “I always thought, I continue to think that a trade escalation between Europe and the United States would have unpredictable, potentially devastating consequences,” she said. Meloni said that she needed to understand what the exemptions might be, including on agricultural products, which are of concern to Italy, given its wine exports in particular. “So there are a number of elements that are missing as well, as I don’t know exactly what we are referring to when we talk about investments, gas purchases."" She noted that the deal in its current form is legally nonbinding in principle, “so there is still, let’s say, room to fight.” Major exports to the U.S.: Packaged medicines and batteries. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, an ally of Trump who has gained a following within the MAGA movement, blasted the agreement on Monday as a failure on the part of Europe’s leadership. “Even at first glance, it is obvious to me that this is not an agreement,” Orbán said in a video discussion with his party’s spokesman. “Donald Trump ate (European Commission President) Ursula von der Leyen for breakfast, that’s what happened.” Orbán, a frequent EU critic, has been careful not to criticize Trump’s administration for its trade policy, instead faulting the bloc for being unable to conclude a comprehensive tariff agreement with Washington. Orbán said that a U.S.-U.K. trade deal, which imposed a blanket 10% tariff on British exports, was more favorable than the one concluded with the EU. “The American president is a heavyweight negotiator, and (von der Leyen) is a featherweight,” Orbán said. “The European agreement is worse than the British one, so portraying it as a success will be difficult.” Jon Harrison at TS Lombard: “It is no surprise to find that trade deals agreed under duress in weeks rather than the usual years of careful negotiation leave a mass of detail incomplete and open to interpretation.” Jack Allen-Reynolds, deputy chief eurozone economist at Capital Economics: “We think this will reduce EU GDP (gross domestic product) by about 0.5%, which is worse than we had previously assumed.” “While the deal has avoided a much worse outcome for now, it remains to be seen whether it will last.” Julian Hinz, trade expert at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy: “The deal agreed yesterday is not a good deal — it is appeasement. “While the EU may avert a trade war in the short term, it is paying a high price in the long term by abandoning the principles of the multilateral, rules-based world trade system of the World Trade Organization.” ___ Justin Spike reported from Budapest, Hungary, Thomas Adamson from Paris, and Nicole Winfield from Rome.
