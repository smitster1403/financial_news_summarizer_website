"Toyota reports a 37% drop in profit, cuts its forecast due to Trump's tariffs",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/toyota-reports-a-37-drop-in-profit-cuts-its-forecast-due-to-trumps-tariffs-2025-08-07/,"TOKYO (AP) — Toyota's profit plunged 37% in the April-June quarter, the company said Thursday, cutting its full year earnings forecasts largely because of President Donald Trump’s tariffs. The Japanese automaker said it based its report on the assumption that Trump’s tariffs on exports from Japan, including autos, would be 12.5% starting this month. As of now they stand at 15%. The world’s top automaker also makes vehicles in Mexico and Canada. Toyota’s profit in the last quarter totaled 841 billion yen, or $5.7 billion, down from 1.33 trillion yen in the same period the year before. Its quarterly sales rose 3%. The status of those exports is unclear since Mexico and Canada are beneficiaries of the U.S. Mexico Canada Agreement, renegotiated from a 1990s pact during Trump's first term in office, that eliminated most tariffs and trade barriers between the three countries. Toyota Motor Corp.’s April-June profit totaled 841 billion yen ($5.7 billion), down from 1.33 trillion yen in the same period of 2024. Quarterly sales rose 3% to 12 trillion yen ($82 billion). Toyota said the tariffs cost its quarterly operating profit 450 billion yen ($3 billion). Cost reduction efforts and the negative impact of an unfavorable exchange rate also hurt its bottom line. The company, which makes the Camry sedan and Lexus luxury models, forecast a 2.66 trillion yen ($18 billion) profit for the full fiscal year ending in March 2026, down from an earlier forecast for a 3.1 trillion yen ($21 billion) profit. Toyota earned nearly 4.8 trillion yen in the previous fiscal year. “Despite a challenging external environment, we have continued to make comprehensive investments, as well as improvements such as increased unit sales, cost reductions and expanded value chain profits,” Toyota said in a statement that outlined its efforts to minimize the impact of the tariffs. At the retail level, Toyota sold 2.4 million vehicles globally, with sales growing in Japan, North America and Europe from the previous year, when global retail totaled 2.2 million vehicles. Analysts say Toyota is likely among the worst hit by the tariffs among global companies, even compared with other Japanese automakers. ___ Yuri Kageyama is on Threads: https://www.threads.com/@yurikageyama Before you consider Toyota Motor, you'll want to hear this.

Germans worry their beloved kebab may get more pricy or even scarce because of factory strike,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/germans-worry-their-beloved-kebab-may-get-more-pricy-or-even-scarce-because-of-factory-strike-2025-08-07/,"BERLIN (AP) — Germans are in kebab angst. They worry that their most beloved street food option, the spicy, juicy kebab in a pita that can be found on every street corner across Germany, may get more expensive — or even worse, that the country may be sliding into a national kebab shortage. Even if these fears may sound exaggerated at first, they aren't unfounded. Workers at one of Germany's biggest kebab factories are locked in a bitter and ongoing fight with their employer over wages and working conditions. For weeks, workers at the Birtat Meat World SE factory in southwestern Germany have repeatedly stopped the production line by walking off their jobs in ""warning strikes,” demanding wage increases of 375 euros ($434) per month. Their current salaries vary widely, and haven't been disclosed. The Food, Beverages and Catering Union that represents them says that payment methods are nontransparent and workers are making vastly different salaries for the same kind of job, according to German news agency dpa. Workers are also trying to organize a collective contract agreement for all employees with the help of the union. Many workers are immigrants from Turkey, Romania or Bulgaria, who spend long, tough workdays in the factory, which has near freezing temperatures to keep the raw meat fresh. On Wednesday, many workers walked off their jobs again, waving flags in front of the factory's main gate, playing drums, whistling and shouting for higher salaries and unionized contracts. German media have reported that Birtat hasn't yielded to any of the demands so far. The company didn't immediately respond to requests for an interview. Birtat, which is located in Murr, 30 kilometers (nearly 20 miles) north of Stuttgart, has been making kebab skewers for more than 30 years. The company says on its website that it makes skewers of ground beef, veal, chicken or turkey kebab that can weigh up to 120 kilograms (260 pounds). The workers chop up the meat, marinate it and push chunks of the raw produce on long metal skewers. The meat is then shock-frozen and and delivered to restaurants all over the country. Birtat says it supplies thousands of kebab stands and fast food places and reaches more than 13 million consumers every month. Some restaurant owners worry that should the workers decide to go on a long-term strike, the Germans' favorite fast-food snack may indeed become more expensive or even scarce. Germans already complain that the meaty snack, which used to be a cheap staple that sold for 2.50 euros about two decades ago, has become too expensive, with most places charging at least 7 euros ($8) or more. Halil Duman was pondering the state of the kebab business as he was busy slicing off thin pieces of ground beef at Pergamon Döner, a small eatery at Berlin’s Friedrichstrasse train station where people were lining up for lunch. “It's all getting more and more difficult,"" the 68-year-old Turkish immigrant said. ""The produce is becoming more expensive and we barely make profit anymore.” “But if we raise the prices any further, people won't buy here anymore,” said Duman, who has been working at kebab stores in the German capital for more than 30 years and was selling the classic kebab sandwich for 7.50 euros (around $8.70). Germans have long fancied the kebab sandwich, which is called a döner in Germany. The word comes from the Turkish verb “donmek,” meaning to turn — the meat is grilled for hours on a spit and cut off in razor-thin slices when it's crisp and brown. First brought to Berlin by Turkish immigrants in the 1970s, the grilled meat snack, which comes wrapped in pita bread with shredded lettuce, tomatoes, onions and different dressings, is now sold everywhere in Germany, from regions stretching from the Baltic Sea to the Bavarian Alps. According to legend, it was Mahmut Aygun, a Turkish guest worker, who invented the first döner sandwich in 1971, when he sold the meat in a piece of pita bread with yogurt dressing at a stand close to a main train station next to the zoo in West Berlin. About 2.9 million people with Turkish roots live in Germany — but the döner kebab sandwich has become so ubiquitous in the country that many foreign tourists consider it typically German and don't even know about the snack's immigrant past. Nele Langfeld, a 22-year-old university student, had come to Pergamon Döner because she was craving the yummy comfort food after having just finished an exam. Waiting in line for her turn, she said that while she hadn't heard about the labor dispute at Birtat, she sure didn't like the prospect of a possible döner shortage or higher prices. “I live on a budget and that's the last thing I need,” she said. “Döner is the one affordable meal that really fills your stomach — it should stay that way.” Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

The Latest: Trump's tariffs go into effect,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/the-latest-trumps-tariffs-go-into-effect-2025-08-07/,"The U.S. began officially levying higher taxes on imports from dozens of countries Thursday, four months after President Donald Trump first announced plans to impose tariffs on most of the world while seeking new trade agreements across the board. The White House said that starting just after midnight goods from more than 60 countries and the European Union would face tariff rates of 10% or higher. Products from the European Union, Japan and South Korea will be taxed at 15%, while imports from Taiwan, Vietnam and Bangladesh will be taxed at 20%. Trump also expects places such as the EU, Japan and South Korea to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S. The Trump White House is confident that the onset of his broad tariffs will provide clarity about the path of the world’s largest economy. Now that companies understand the direction the U.S. is headed, the administration believes they can ramp up new investments and jump-start hiring in ways that can rebalance the U.S. economy as a manufacturing power. But so far, economic data has shown a U.S. economy that began flagging after Trump’s initial rollout of tariffs in April. Here's the latest: A top body of Indian exporters said Thursday the latest U.S. tariffs will impact nearly 55% of the country’s outbound shipments to America and force exporters to lose their long-standing clients. “Absorbing this sudden cost escalation is simply not viable. Margins are already thin,” S.C. Ralhan, president of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations, said in a statement. The tariffs effectively impose a cost burden, placing Indian exporters at a competitive disadvantage with countries that have lesser import taxes, he added. In 2024, the U.S. ran a $45.8 billion trade deficit in goods with India, meaning America imported more from India than it exported, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. American consumers and businesses buy pharmaceutical drugs, precious stones, and textiles and apparel from India, among other goods. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday said India will never compromise the interests of farmers. “For us, the interests of farmers are a top priority. I know I will have to personally pay a heavy price for it, but I am ready,” Modi said at a conference in what was seen as a message to the U.S. administration, which has been seeking greater access to India’s agriculture and dairy sectors. India and the U.S. have had five rounds of negotiations on a bilateral trade agreement, but haven’t been able to clinch one so far. On Wednesday, Trump signed an executive order to place an additional 25% tariff on India for its purchases of Russian oil. The order would go into effect in 21 days and bring the combined tariffs imposed on India to 50%. Japanese entertainment and electronics company Sony said Thursday its profit surged 23% in the last quarter from the year before, as damage from U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs was less than it had expected. Sony raised its forecast for its profit in the full fiscal year until March 2026 to 970 billion yen ($6.6 billion), from an earlier forecast of 930 billion yen ($6.3 billion). The revised projection is still lower than what it earned in the previous fiscal year at 1 trillion yen. Sony now estimates the impact of the additional U.S. tariffs on its operating income at 70 billion yen ($476 million), much better than the initial estimate of 100 billion yen ($680 million).

Asian shares mostly climb after a rally for Apple led Wall Street higher,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/asian-shares-mostly-climb-after-a-rally-for-apple-led-wall-street-higher-2025-08-07/,"MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Asian shares mostly advanced and financial markets appeared to show scant if any reaction to higher tariffs on exports to the United States that took effect early Thursday. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 added 0.6% to 41,025.76. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng climbed 0.6% to 25,057.84 and the Shanghai Composite added 0.1% to 3,637.96. China reported that its exports picked up in July, helped by a flurry of shipments by businesses taking advantage of a pause in U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff war with Beijing. South Korea’s Kospi rose 0.6% to 3,217.67 while the S&P/ASX 200 in Australia shed 0.2% to 8,828.70. India’s Sensex gave up 0.6% after Trump ordered tariffs on imports from the world's most populous nation to rise to 50%, citing its crude oil imports from Russia. Trump also declared 100% tariffs on computer chips with an exemption for U.S. investments. Apple's shares rose 5.1% on Wednesday ahead of a White House event where it announced an increase to its U.S. investments of an additional $100 billion over the next four years. Mizuho Bank, in a commentary, said the Trump’s exemption from 100% tariffs on semiconductors for those with investments in U.S. production means trade partners may be able to use investments as a bargaining chip. Taiwan's Taiex jumped 2.4% as shares in market heavyweight Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. surged 4.9%. TSMC is the world's largest contract maker of computer chips and it has been ramping up its investments in U.S. factory capacity, helping to alleviate the impact from higher tariffs. South Korean chipmakers also saw strong gains, with Samsung Electronics jumping 2.1% after the government said its products would also be subject to the exemption. On Wednesday, a rally for Apple led Wall Street higher, with U.S. stocks reclaiming more of their sharp losses from last week. The S&P 500 rose 0.7% to 6,345.06. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.2% to 44,193.12, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 1.2% to 21,169.42. Apple alone accounted for more than a third of the S&P 500’s gain. Trading elsewhere on Wall Street was mixed following a jumble of profit reports. McDonald’s and Shopify rose following their latest updates, while Super Micro Computer tumbled after its earnings and revenue came in below analysts’ expectations. The Walt Disney Co. fell after its earnings beat forecasts but its revenue fell short Worries are still high that Trump’s tariffs may be hurting the economy, but hopes for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve and a parade of stronger-than-expected profit reports from U.S. companies have helped steady the market. In other dealings early Thursday, benchmark U.S. crude climbed 44 cents to $64.79 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, added 42 cents to $67.31 a barrel. The U.S. dollar slipped to 147.33 Japanese yen from 147.36 yen. The euro cost $1.1670, up from $1.1661. __ AP Business writers Stan Choe and Matt Ott contributed.

How India ended up facing steep US tariffs despite its strategic partnership,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/how-india-ended-up-facing-steep-us-tariffs-despite-its-strategic-partnership-2025-08-07/,"NEW DELHI (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump has vowed additional 25% tariff on India for its purchases of Russian oil, bringing the combined tariffs imposed by the United States on its ally to 50%. India has called the additional tariffs “unfortunate.” Trump's Wednesday announcement came as India and the U.S. are still negotiating a trade deal that has faced roadblocks after it was first announced when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Trump in Washington earlier this year. It also comes at a time when ties between India and the U.S. appear to have taken a hit even as Modi and Trump share a warm relationship. Here is how India, a strategic partner of the U.S. in Asia, ended up facing steep tariffs: Trump imposes tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China. He initially spares India, despite repeatedly calling the country a “tariff king,"" but threatens that high tariffs are coming. Modi meets Trump in Washington in an effort to resolve trade concerns. Trump again warns of higher U.S. tariffs on Indian goods. India and the U.S. agree to work on a trade deal and expand bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030. They don't share details as to how the target would be achieved. Modi says he expects a deal to be completed later this year. India’s trade minister, Piyush Goyal, visits Washington and meets his counterparts to initiate negotiations for the bilateral trade agreement. U.S. Vice President JD Vance meets Modi in New Delhi and says both sides are making progress on trade talks. India and the U.S. also finalize the terms of reference for the trade negotiation, bringing them a step closer to an agreement. Trump says he stopped military hostilities between India and Pakistan by offering possible trade concessions to both. India is angered by Trump’s claims and disputes them. Trade minister Goyal leads a team of senior Indian officials to Washington for more negotiations. India’s commerce secretary says the proposed bilateral trade agreement is progressing “very well.” Trump signals a deal may be close. “We’re having some great deals. We have one coming up, maybe with India, a very big one, where we’re going to open up India,” he says. An Indian trade delegation visits Washington for another round of discussions, which end without reaching a breakthrough. Goyal says India is ready to make trade deals in “the national interest,” but not just to meet deadlines. Trump imposes 25% tariffs on Indian imports. He warns of further penalties for India because of its buying of Russian oil, and calls its economy “dead.” Trump vows an additional 25% import taxes on India to punish the country for its purchases of Russian oil, bringing combined tariffs to 50%. The tariffs are set to go into effect after 21 days. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

New US tariffs cloud outlook for exporters in Asia and beyond,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/new-us-tariffs-cloud-outlook-for-exporters-in-asia-and-beyond-2025-08-07/,"BANGKOK (AP) — President Donald Trump’s new tariff rates on U.S. imports from dozens of countries took effect Thursday, the latest chapter in the saga of Trump’s reshaping of global trade. But many questions remain. Trump has threatened tariffs of up to 200% on imports of pharmaceuticals and has ordered a 100% import tax on computer chips. Most U.S. imports of copper, steel and aluminum are subject to a 50% tariff. There’s still no agreement on what tariffs might apply to products shipped from China. India has no deal yet and faces a potential 50% tariff as Trump pressures it to stop buying oil from Russia. Recent data shows uncertainty is clouding the outlook for exporters around the world as a rush to beat the tariffs during a pause for negotiation tapers off. Companies are reporting billions of dollars in higher costs or losses due to the higher import duties. Global financial markets took Thursday's tariff adjustments in stride, with Asian shares and U.S. futures mostly higher. Here's where things stand in what has proven to be a fast-changing policy landscape. The tariffs announced on Aug. 1 apply to 66 countries, Taiwan and the Falkland Islands. They are a revised version of what Trump called "" reciprocal tariffs,"" announced on April 2: import taxes of up to 50% on goods from countries that have a trade surplus with the United States, along with 10% “baseline’’ taxes on almost everyone else. That move triggered sell-offs in financial markets and Trump backtracked to allow time for trade talks. The president has bypassed Congress, which has authority over taxes, by invoking a 1977 law to declare the trade deficit a national emergency. That's being challenged in court, but the revised tariffs still took effect. To keep their access to the huge American market, major trading partners have struck deals with Trump. The United Kingdom agreed to 10% tariffs and the European Union, South Korea and Japan accepted U.S. tariffs of 15%. Those are much higher than the low single-digit rates they paid last year, but down from the 30% Trump had ordered for the EU and the 25% he ordered for Japan. Countries in Africa and Asia are mostly facing lower rates than the ones Trump decreed in April. Thailand, Pakistan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines cut deals with Trump, settling for rates of around 20%. Indonesia views its 19% tariff deal as a leg up against exporters in other countries that will have to pay slightly more, said Fithra Faisal Hastiadi, a spokesperson in the Indonesian president's office. “We were competing against Vietnam, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and China ... and they are all subject to higher reciprocal tariffs,” Hastiadi said. “We believe we will stay competitive.” Trump has yet to announce whether he will extend an Aug. 12 deadline for reaching a trade agreement with China that would forestall earlier threats of tariffs of up to 245%. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the president is deciding about another 90-day delay to allow time to work out details of an agreement setting tariffs on most products at 50%, including extra import duties related to illicit trade in fentanyl. Higher import taxes on small parcels from China have hurt smaller factories and layoffs have accelerated, leaving some 200 million workers reliant on “flexible work” — the gig economy — for their livelihoods, the government estimates. India also has no broad trade agreement with Trump. On Wednesday, Trump he signed an executive order placing an extra 25% tariff for its purchases of Russian oil, bringing combined U.S. tariffs to 50%. India's Foreign Ministry has stood firm, saying it began importing oil from Russia because traditional supplies were diverted to Europe after the outbreak of the Ukraine conflict, a “necessity compelled by the global market situation.” Struggling, impoverished Laos and war-torn Myanmar and Syria face 40-41% rates. Trump whacked Brazil with a 50% import tax largely because he’s unhappy with its treatment of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. South Africa said the steep 30% rate Trump has ordered on the exporter of precious gems and metals has put 30,000 jobs at risk and left the country scrambling to find new markets outside the United States. Even wealthy Switzerland is under the gun. Swiss officials were visiting Washington this week to try to stave off a whopping 39% tariff on U.S. imports of its chocolate, watches and other products. The rate is over 2 1/2 times the 15% rate on European Union goods exported to the United States. Goods that comply with the 2020 United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement that Trump negotiated during his first term are excluded from the tariffs. Even though U.S. neighbor and ally Canada was hit by a 35% tariff after it defied Trump, a staunch supporter of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, by saying it would recognize a Palestinian state, nearly all of its exports to the U.S. remain duty free. Canada’s central bank says 100% of energy exports and 95% of other exports are compliant with the agreement since regional rules mean Canadian and Mexico companies can claim preferential treatment. The slice of Mexican exports not covered by the USMCA is subject to a 25% tariff, down from an earlier rate of 30%, during a 90-day negotiating period that began last week. Surveys of factory managers offer monthly insights into export orders, hiring and other indicators of how businesses are faring. The latest figures in the United States and globally mostly showed conditions deteriorating. In Japan, factory output contracted in July, purchasing activity fell and hiring slowed, according to the S&P Global Manufacturing PMI. But the data were collected before Trump announced a trade deal that cut tariffs on Japanese exports to 15% from 25%. Similar surveys show a deterioration in manufacturing conditions worldwide, as a boost from “front loading” export orders to beat higher tariffs faded, S&P Global said. Similar measures for service industries have remained stronger, reflecting more domestic business activity. In Asia, that includes a rebound in tourism across the region. Corporate bottom lines are also taking a hit. Honda Motor said Wednesday that it estimates the cost from higher tariffs at about $3 billion. On top that, the U.S. economy — Trump's trump card as the world's biggest market — is starting to show pain from months of tariff threats. ___ Associated Press writer Niniek Karmini in Jakarta and Aniruddha Ghosal in Hanoi contributed.

RSI Stock Soars 22% On Q2 Blowout—Will PENN Match the Momentum?,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/rsi-stock-soars-22-after-q2-blowoutwill-penn-match-the-momentum/,"Online casino and sports betting firm Rush Street Interactive Inc. NYSE: RSI has been one of the biggest surprises of the second-quarter earnings period. The company's impressive earnings report sent shares skyrocketing by nearly 22% in the span of just five days. With major wins for both Rush Street's online casino business and its sports betting operations, the company seems poised for continued growth going forward. Beyond the implications of a strong quarter for Rush Street in particular, however, is the suggestion that this could be the first of several online casino names to win this earnings season. Indeed, advances in AI and user experience, growing certainty surrounding regulations, the rise of data-driven personalization of casino experiences, and a customer shift toward a younger demographic may all be contributing to a noteworthy moment for online gaming companies. As major competitors like PENN Entertainment Inc. NASDAQ: PENN deliver their most recent quarterly updates, investors will get a clearer picture of whether Rush Street was an indicator of wins for the industry as a whole or a standout player on its own. Before comparing RSI to others in the space, it’s important to understand the full scope of Rush Street's recent earnings win. The company's revenue grew by 22% year-over-year (YOY), reaching record levels, while its EBITDA jumped by an impressive 88% over the same period. These gains were driven by 25% and 15% increases, respectively, in revenue from the firm's online casino and sports betting segments. Rush Street's global popularity is expanding, as the company saw a YOY surge in monthly active users (MAUs) in North America (30%) as well as Latin America (40%). While it was growing at a rapid pace, Rush Street also managed to stay debt-free and continue building its stockpile of $241 million in cash reserves. The company expects slightly more modest full-year revenue and EBITDA growth of 16% and 51%, respectively, as it raised its full-year guidance. Analysts are largely bullish on Rush Street, as eight out of 10 rated RSI a Buy, despite the fact that the recent rally sent the stock price just above the consensus price target of around $18 per share. Despite being just over half the size of Rush Street, PENN Entertainment's smaller size, the company is expanding rapidly. It has multiple growth projects in development for the next several quarters, including a land-based casino planned in Iowa valued at up to $200 million. On the digital front, PENN continues to invest in its iCasino and online sports betting offerings, particularly after its acquisition of theScore and strategic pivot away from Barstool Sportsbook. These moves aim to tighten integration across platforms and appeal to younger digital-first audiences. Its partnership with ESPN for ESPN BET has garnered attention but also heightened expectations. When PENN reports second-quarter earnings, investors will hope to see signs of continued progress on its multiple developments and, ideally, a strong improvement in top- and bottom-line performance. Despite some volatility in earnings performance in past quarters, the company’s liquidity remains strong, and it continues to execute on long-term growth plans. All told, though, analysts feel positively about PENN shares, with 11 out of 19 calling the company a Buy and setting a consensus price target suggesting about 33% in upside potential. Still, concerns persist around execution risk, brand differentiation in a crowded space, and the delayed payoff of long-term strategic bets. Rush Street’s Q2 performance shows that an online casino firm can deliver growth and profitability at scale, both domestically and internationally, with disciplined marketing and rising user value. With strong fundamentals and raised guidance, RSI is currently setting the pace in its segment. As investors await PENN’s upcoming earnings report on Aug. 7, the key question is whether it can mirror RSI’s momentum or forge a different path to growth through its hybrid land-based and digital strategy. PENN’s execution will be especially important given the competitive and evolving landscape. Notably, casino competitor DraftKings NASDAQ: DKNG reported a surprise slight earnings miss this quarter. Despite its scale and dominant sportsbook footprint, the company reported an EPS of 38 cents, slightly short of the analyst expectations of 41 cents. That miss raises the possibility that RSI’s performance isn’t just a rising tide lifting all boats, but rather a sign of company-specific outperformance. It also puts added pressure on PENN to demonstrate clear strategic gains. All told, RSI's breakout quarter could be a turning point for investor confidence in mid-tier digital gaming firms, especially if PENN can validate the trend. But if PENN underwhelms, it may reinforce the notion that Rush Street is the outlier, not the bellwether. Before you consider Rush Street Interactive, you'll want to hear this.

"Trump's broad tariffs go into effect, just as economic pain is surfacing",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trumps-broad-tariffs-go-into-effect-just-as-economic-pain-is-surfacing-2025-08-06/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump was set to officially begin levying higher import taxes on dozens of countries Thursday, just as the economic fallout of his monthslong tariff threats has begun to create visible damage for the U.S. economy. The White House said that starting just after midnight that goods from more than 60 countries and the European Union would face tariff rates of 10% or higher. Products from the European Union, Japan and South Korea will be taxed at 15%, while imports from Taiwan, Vietnam and Bangladesh will be taxed at 20%. For places such as the EU, Japan and South Korea, Trump also expects them to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S. “I think the growth is going to be unprecedented,” Trump said Wednesday afternoon. He added that the U.S. was “taking in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs,” but he couldn't provide a specific figure for revenues because “we don’t even know what the final number is” regarding tariff rates. Despite the uncertainty, the Trump White House is confident that the onset of his broad tariffs will provide clarity about the path of the world's largest economy. Now that companies understand the direction the U.S. is headed, the administration believes they can ramp up new investments and jump-start hiring in ways that can rebalance the U.S. economy as a manufacturing power. But so far, there are signs of self-inflicted wounds to America as companies and consumers alike brace for the impact of new taxes. What the data has shown is a U.S. economy that changed in April with Trump’s initial rollout of tariffs, an event that led to market drama, a negotiating period and Trump's ultimate decision to start his universal tariffs on Thursday. After April, economic reports show that hiring began to stall, inflationary pressures crept upward and home values in key markets started to decline, said John Silvia, CEO of Dynamic Economic Strategy. “A less productive economy requires fewer workers,” Silvia said in an analysis note. “But there is more, the higher tariff prices lower workers' real wages. The economy has become less productive, and firms cannot pay the same real wages as before. Actions have consequences.” Even then, the ultimate transformations of the tariffs are unknown and could play out over months, if not years. Many economists say the risk is that the American economy is steadily eroded rather than collapsing instantly. “We all want it to be made for television where it’s this explosion — it’s not like that,” said Brad Jensen, a professor at Georgetown University. “It’s going to be fine sand in the gears and slow things down.” Trump has promoted the tariffs as a way to reduce the persistent trade deficit. But importers sought to avoid the taxes by importing more goods before the taxes went into effect. As a result, the $582.7 billion trade imbalance for the first half of the year was 38% higher than in 2024. Total construction spending has dropped 2.9% over the past year, and the factory jobs promised by Trump have so far resulted in job losses. The lead-up to Thursday fit the slapdash nature of Trump's tariffs, which have been variously rolled out, walked back, delayed, increased, imposed by letter and frantically renegotiated. The process has been so muddled that officials for key trade partners were unclear at the start of the week whether the tariffs would begin Thursday or Friday. The language of the July 31 order to delay the start of tariffs from Aug. 1 said the higher tax rates would start in seven days. On Wednesday morning, Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, was asked if the new tariffs began at midnight Thursday, and he said reporters should check with the U.S. Trade Representative's Office. Trump on Wednesday announced additional 25% tariffs to be imposed on India for its buying of Russian oil, bringing their total import taxes to 50%. He has said that import taxes are still coming on pharmaceutical drugs and announced 100% tariffs on computer chips, meaning the U.S. economy could remain in a place of suspended animation as it awaits the impact. The president's use of a 1977 law to declare an economic emergency to impose the tariffs is also under challenge. The impending ruling from last week's hearing before a U.S. appeals court could cause Trump to find other legal justifications if judges say he exceeded his authority. Even people who worked with Trump during his first term are skeptical that things will go smoothly for the economy, such as Paul Ryan, the former Republican House speaker, who has emerged as a Trump critic. “There’s no sort of rationale for this other than the president wanting to raise tariffs based upon his whims, his opinions,” Ryan told CNBC on Wednesday. “I think choppy waters are ahead because I think they’re going to have some legal challenges.” Still, the stock market has been solid during the recent tariff drama, with the S&P 500 index climbing more than 25% from its April low. The market's rebound and the income tax cuts in Trump's tax and spending measures signed into law on July 4 have given the White House confidence that economic growth is bound to accelerate in the coming months. As of now, Trump still foresees an economic boom while the rest of the world and American voters wait nervously. “There’s one person who can afford to be cavalier about the uncertainty that he’s creating, and that’s Donald Trump,” said Rachel West, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation who worked in the Biden White House on labor policy. “The rest of Americans are already paying the price for that uncertainty.” Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

"Americans get more than half their calories from ultra-processed foods, CDC report says",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/americans-get-more-than-half-their-calories-from-ultraprocessed-foods-cdc-report-says-2025-08-06/,"Most Americans get more than half their calories from ultra-processed foods, those super-tasty, energy-dense foods typically full of sugar, salt and unhealthy fats, according to a new federal report. Nutrition research has shown for years that ultra-processed foods make up a big chunk of the U.S. diet, especially for kids and teens. For the first time, however, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed those high levels of consumption, using dietary data collected from August 2021 to August 2023. The report comes amid growing scrutiny of such foods by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who blames them for causing chronic disease. “We are poisoning ourselves and it's coming principally from these ultra-processed foods,” Kennedy told Fox News earlier this year. Overall, about 55% of total calories consumed by Americans age 1 and older came from ultra-processed foods during that period, according to the report. For adults, ultra-processed foods made up about 53% of total calories consumed, but for kids through age 18, it was nearly 62%. The top sources included burgers and sandwiches, sweet baked goods, savory snacks, pizza and sweetened drinks. Young children consumed fewer calories from ultra-processed foods than older kids, the report found. Adults 60 and older consumed fewer calories from those sources than younger adults. Low-income adults consumed more ultra-processed foods than those with higher incomes. The results were not surprising, said co-author Anne Williams, a CDC nutrition expert. What was surprising was that consumption of ultra-processed foods appeared to dip slightly over the past decade. Among adults, total calories from those sources fell from about 56% in 2013-2014 and from nearly 66% for kids in 2017-2018. Williams said she couldn't speculate about the reason for the decline or whether consumption of less processed foods increased. But Andrea Deierlein, a nutrition expert at New York University who was not involved in the research, suggested that there may be greater awareness of the potential harms of ultra-processed foods. “People are trying, at least in some populations, to decrease their intakes of these foods,” she said. Concern over ultra-processed foods' health effects has been growing for years, but finding solutions has been difficult. Many studies have linked them to obesity, diabetes and heart disease, but they haven't been able to prove that the foods directly cause those chronic health problems. One small but influential study found that even when diets were matched for calories, sugar, fat, fiber and micronutrients, people consumed more calories and gained more weight when they ate ultra-processed foods than when they ate minimally processed foods. Research published this week in the journal Nature found that participants in a clinical trial lost twice as much weight when they ate minimally processed foods — such as pasta, chicken, fruits and vegetables — than ultra-processed foods, even those matched for nutrition components and considered healthy, such as ready-to-heat frozen meals, protein bars and shakes. Part of the problem is simply defining ultra-processed foods. The new CDC report used the most common definition based on the four-tier Nova system developed by Brazilian researchers that classifies foods according to the amount of processing they undergo. Such foods tend to be “hyperpalatable, energy-dense, low in dietary fiber and contain little or no whole foods, while having high amounts of salt, sweeteners and unhealthy fats,” the CDC report said. U.S. health officials recently said there are concerns over whether current definitions “accurately capture” the range of foods that may affect health. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Agriculture Department recently issued a request for information to develop a new, uniform definition of ultra-processed foods for products in the U.S. food supply. In the meantime, Americans should try to reduce ultra-processed foods in their daily diets, Deierlein said. For instance, instead of instant oatmeal that may contain added sugar, sodium, artificial colors and preservatives, use plain oats sweetened with honey or maple syrup. Read food packages and nutrition information, she suggested. “I do think that there are less-processed options available for many foods,” she said. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

United Airlines flights grounded nationwide because of technology problem,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/united-airlines-flights-grounded-nationwide-because-of-technology-problem-2025-08-06/,"United Airlines flights on major routes were grounded Wednesday because of a technology issue, the airline said, and additional flight delays continued into the night. An alert on the Federal Aviation Administration website said all United flights destined for Chicago were halted at their departing airports. The agency said Denver, Newark, Houston and San Francisco airports were also impacted by halted flights. “Safety is our top priority, and we’ll work with our customers to get them to their destinations,” an emailed statement from the Chicago based-airline said. A statement Wednesday night said the underlying technology issue had been resolved and employees were working to restore normal operations. The impacted system, called Unimatic, houses flight information that is fed to other systems including those that calculate weight and balance and track flight times, according to United. The system outage, as the company described it, lasted several hours, the statement said. It wasn't related to recent concerns about airline industry cybersecurity. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said on social media that the issue was unrelated to the broader air traffic control system. An AP journalist had boarded a United plane at the Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport for a trip to Houston when flight attendants announced a “systemwide” problem had grounded flights. They then sent passengers back to the terminal. Another traveler, Johan Kotze, was at the New Orleans airport to begin a journey to the Indian Ocean island nation of Mauritius for vacation. Getting caught up in flight delays for him likely meant he would miss connecting flights along the way and would have to rebook not only the flights but a car and accommodations as well. “It's not very nice,"" he said of the experience. United Airlines apologized on social media to upset customers who were facing delays and hours sitting in planes on runways. “Hey there, we apologize for the travel disruption today,” the airline told a customer on the social platform X. “Our teams are working to resolve the outage as quickly as possible. Thank you for your patience.” The airline said it was paying customer expenses including hotels when applicable. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

Ontario premier says he doesn't trust Trump and warns the US president could reopen trade pact,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/ontario-premier-says-he-doesnt-trust-trump-and-warns-the-us-president-could-reopen-trade-pact-2025-08-06/,"TORONTO (AP) — The leader of Canada’s most populous province said Wednesday he doesn’t trust U.S. President Donald Trump and expects the president to soon reopen the free trade agreement he agreed to in his first term. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said the federal government needs to prepare for that to happen this fall. Ford made the comments after the country’s provincial premiers and Prime Minister Mark Carney met in private for the first time since Trump escalated his trade war by hitting Canada with a baseline 35% tariff last week. The new tariff, which took effect on Friday after the two countries failed to hit an Aug. 1 deadline to secure a new trade agreement, applies only to goods not covered by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement that Trump negotiated during his first term. Trump previously hailed the agreement as “the fairest, most balanced and beneficial trade agreement we have ever signed. "" Carney has said about 85% of trade with the U.S. remains tariff-free because of USMCA. Ford said Trump likely won’t wait for the scheduled review of the agreement next year. “He’s not waiting until 2026. At any given time, President Trump — not that he even follows the rules — he can pull the carpet out from underneath us,” Ford told reporters in Toronto Wednesday. “I’m going to ask the people, do you trust President Trump? I don’t.” Carney told a press conference on Tuesday that he has not talked to Trump in recent days but would speak with him “when it makes sense.” Sector-specific tariffs on Canada, like the 50% duty on steel, aluminum and copper, remain in place. Carney also suggested he may lift counter-tariffs if that helps Canada in the ongoing trade dispute. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

Britain's Royal Mail celebrates Monty Python with stamps featuring iconic sketches and characters,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/britains-royal-mail-celebrates-monty-python-with-stamps-featuring-iconic-sketches-and-characters-2025-08-06/,"LONDON (AP) — And now for something completely different: Britain’s Royal Mail has issued stamps celebrating the absurdist comedy of Monty Python. The 10-stamp series announced on Thursday celebrates some of the troupe’s most iconic characters and catchphrases, from “Nudge, nudge” to “The Lumberjack Song.” Six stamps depict scenes from the sketch-comedy TV series “Monty Python’s Flying Circus,” including “The Spanish Inquisition,” ”The Ministry of Silly Walks,"" “Dead Parrot” and “The Nude Organist.” Another four mark the 50th anniversary of the cult classic 1975 film “Monty Python and the Holy Grail,” including one showing the limb-losing Black Knight insisting, “’Tis but a scratch.” The stamps can be pre-ordered from Thursday and go on sale Aug. 14. Made up of Michael Palin, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones and Graham Chapman, Monty Python brought a unique blend of satire, surrealism and silliness to British TV screens in a series that ran from 1969 to 1974. The troupe also made several feature films, including “And Now for Something Completely Different,” “Monty Python’s Life of Brian” and “Monty Python’s The Meaning of Life.” David Gold, Royal Mail’s director of external affairs, said the collection “honors a body of work that has shaped the comedic landscape for nearly six decades.” Palin said he was “very glad to share a stamp with the nude organist!” The group largely disbanded in the 1980s, and Chapman died of cancer in 1989. The five surviving Pythons reunited in 2014 for a string of live stage shows. Jones died in 2020 from a rare form of dementia. Before you consider Royal Mail, you'll want to hear this.

How DigitalOcean's Focus Is Fueling Explosive Growth,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/how-digitaloceans-focus-is-fueling-explosive-growth/,"In the world of cloud computing, a market famously dominated by tech titans like Amazon NASDAQ: AMZN, Microsoft NASDAQ: MSFT, and Google NASDAQ: GOOG, it’s easy to assume there is little room for smaller players. Their immense scale and sprawling service catalogs often define the conversation. However, a recent, powerful market signal suggests a different story is unfolding. DigitalOcean Holdings, Inc. NYSE: DOCN, a niche cloud provider with a fraction of the giants' resources, saw its stock price jump by nearly 29% in a single day after releasing its quarterly earnings. This dramatic move begs a critical question for investors: How is a specialized company not only competing but achieving such decisive success? The answer is found in a disciplined and focused strategy that is now firing on all cylinders. The immediate trigger for DigitalOcean’s impressive stock performance was a second-quarter 2025 financial report that confidently beat analyst expectations and signaled business health. For investors, the results were a clear indication of a company executing its plan with remarkable efficiency. For the quarter ending June 30, 2025, DigitalOcean delivered a potent combination of growth and profitability: Beyond looking in the rearview mirror, DigitalOcean’s management provided a forward-looking outlook that strengthened investor confidence. The company raised its guidance for the full 2025 fiscal year, now projecting total revenue between $888 million and $892 million and an upgraded non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.05 to $2.10. An upward revision of this nature is one of the strongest signals management can send, suggesting they see sustained momentum and a clear path to achieving their operational goals for the rest of the year. DigitalOcean's success is the result of a deliberate strategy to dominate a specific and valuable niche: the market for individual developers, startups, and small-to-medium-sized businesses (SMBs) that value simplicity above all else. Where hyperscalers offer complexity and an overwhelming array of services, DigitalOcean provides a streamlined experience, transparent pricing, and extensive community support. The latest financial data proves this model is not just viable; it's highly profitable. The most compelling evidence lies in the company’s ability to grow with its customers. Revenue from its “Builders” clients (those spending over $500 monthly) grew by an impressive 35% year-over-year. This metric is crucial because it validates the company's land-and-expand model: customers start with small projects and, thanks to the platform's ease of use, confidently scale their operations and spending over time. This targeted approach translates directly into a healthy and efficient business, as shown by the $57 million in adjusted free cash flow generated during the quarter. Furthermore, two key customer metrics highlight the strategy's success: With its core business executing so well, DigitalOcean is applying its proven philosophy of simplification to the next significant technology shift: artificial intelligence (AI). The company is strategically positioning itself to win the equally important race of making AI accessible and useful for its core customer base. Its focus is on AI inference (the practical use of models in applications), which is widely expected to be a larger long-term market than model training. The company’s AI revenue is more than doubling year-over-year, which is a clear sign that this approach is working. This growth is being propelled by specific product initiatives designed to remove friction for developers: By focusing on the application layer, DigitalOcean is turning AI from a complex, infrastructure-heavy challenge into a simple, integrated tool, reinforcing its value proposition to developers. DigitalOcean's powerful second-quarter performance is validation of a business model built for a specific purpose. The company has demonstrated its ability to carve out a profitable, high-growth niche in a competitive market by remaining disciplined and focused on the needs of its customers. The path forward appears clear and compelling. The core business is healthy and growing, while the company's focused AI strategy provides a significant catalyst for future expansion. Reinforcing this positive outlook is the prudent financial management demonstrated by the leadership team. By proactively securing a new $800 million credit facility to refinance its future debt obligations, the company is ensuring it has a strong and stable financial foundation from which to pursue its growth ambitions. For investors seeking exposure to the cloud and AI sectors through a company with a proven strategy and a clear runway for growth, DigitalOcean presents a compelling and well-defined case.

"Trump plans 100% tariff on computer chips, unless companies build in US",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-says-he-plans-to-put-a-100-tariff-on-computer-chips-likely-pushing-up-cost-of-electronics-2025-08-06/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he will impose a 100% tariff on computer chips, raising the specter of higher prices for electronics, autos, household appliances and other essential products dependent on the processors powering the digital age. “We’ll be putting a tariff of approximately 100% on chips and semiconductors,” Trump said in the Oval Office while meeting with Apple CEO Tim Cook. ""But if you’re building in the United States of America, there’s no charge."" The announcement came more than three months after Trump temporarily exempted most electronics from his administration's most onerous tariffs. The Republican president said companies that make computer chips in the U.S. would be spared the import tax. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a shortage of computer chips increased the price of autos and contributed to higher inflation. Investors seemed to interpret the potential tariff exemptions as a positive for Apple and other major tech companies that have been making huge financial commitments to manufacture more chips and other components in the U.S.. Big Tech already has made collective commitments to invest about $1.5 trillion in the U.S. since Trump moved back into the White House in January. That figure includes a $600 billion promise from Apple after the iPhone maker boosted its commitment by tacking another $100 billion on to a previous commitment made in February. Now the question is whether the deal brokered between Cook and Trump will be enough to insulate the millions of iPhones made in China and India from the tariffs that the administration has already imposed and reduce the pressure on the company to raise prices on the new models expected to be unveiled next month. Wall Street certainly seems to think so. After Apple's stock price gained 5% in Wednesday regular trading sessions, the shares rose by another 3% in extended trading after Trump announced some tech companies won't be hit with the latest tariffs while Cook stood alongside him. The shares of AI chipmaker Nvidia, which also has recently made big commitments to the U.S., rose slightly in extended trading to add to the $1 trillion gain in market value the Silicon Valley company has made since the start of Trump's second administration. The stock price of computer chip pioneer Intel, which has fallen on hard times, also climbed in extended trading. Inquiries sent to chip makers Nvidia and Intel were not immediately answered. The chip industry's main trade group, the Semiconductor Industry Association, declined to comment on Trump's latest tariffs. Demand for computer chips has been climbing worldwide, with sales increasing 19.6% in the year-ended in June, according to the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics organization. Trump's tariff threats mark a significant break from existing plans to revive computer chip production in the U.S. that were drawn up during the administration of President Joe Biden. Since taking over from Biden, Trump has been deploying tariffs to incentivize more domestic production. Essentially, the president is betting that the threat of dramatically higher chip costs would force most companies to open factories domestically, despite the risk that tariffs could squeeze corporate profits and push up prices for mobile phones, TVs and refrigerators. By contrast, the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act that Biden signed into law in 2022 provided more than $50 billion to support new computer chip plants, fund research and train workers for the industry. The mix of funding support, tax credits and other financial incentives were meant to draw in private investment, a strategy that Trump has vocally opposed. — Liedtke reported from San Ramon, California.

NASDAQ: CELH are gaining popularity again, especially as the stock reaches 90% of its 52-week high and shows enough momentum to potentially push investors toward a new peak for the year. However, there is one major speed bump standing in the way of today’s price and that higher promise. That earnings uncertainty acts as a speed bump for the company’s quarter, as Celsius stock has fallen about 5% in a week just before the upcoming release on August 7, 2025. This behavior can usually be perceived in two different ways, and the first, being the most common, is that the market is expecting some disappointing results from Celsius. The other side to this coin is that the price is now low enough to have priced in some of these bearish expectations, creating a much better risk-to-reward ratio and probability setup for those willing to buy the dip and keep riding on the company’s momentum, which has seemed unstoppable over the past year. Here are some reasons Celsius might make it out okay after earnings. Wall Street analysts rarely give their ratings and valuation targets right before a stock announces quarterly earnings, which is why investors should see the upcoming wave of upgrades in late July 2025 as a sign of confidence heading into the results. While the consensus rating for Celsius stock stands at a Moderate Buy, along with a price target of $47.8 per share, a few analysts were willing to break the mold. Filippo Falorni sees a Buy rating and a $55 per share valuation on Celsius to call for 31% upside potential from today’s prices. Falorni wasn’t alone in this, as Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan Chase & Co. followed suit with her Overweight view and $54 per share target price, roughly in line with Citigroup’s view. Overall, it seems that the potential range to be had on Celsius hovers between $54 and $57 per share, giving investors a shot at not only double-digit upside but also new 52-week highs. If the company can deliver on this, it shouldn’t be surprising to see some institutional buyers step in as well, since most of them use a momentum strategy supported by the right fundamental story. However, while that part of the picture is still uncertain, there is some additional evidence to consider about Celsius beforehand. Over the past month, 13.8% of Celsius stock’s short interest was wiped out of the picture in a clear sign of bearish capitulation. More than that, there is still $976.6 million worth of open short positions. If the stock can deliver a decent quarter and break through to these Wall Street targets, chances are those may be closed out, too. Closing a short position indirectly adds more buying pressure to a stock since it involves buying back the stock short sellers borrowed to sell in the first place. Now, other fundamental factors are at play here that could very well push Celsius toward those new highs. First, Wall Street analysts are set on a forecast for $0.24 in earnings per share (EPS) for the third quarter of 2025, a jump of 33.3% from today’s reported 18 cents in EPS. Knowing that EPS growth is the typical driver behind a stock’s upside, this view matches perfectly with the percentage upside expected from valuation targets. Looking at the last quarterly earnings, there is one clear theme that investors should keep in mind and look for in the upcoming quarterly announcement. Celsius reported a 1.15% increase in its gross margin despite a 7% decline in revenue, and the reason why is all that matters. As the brand and company expand into more international markets, its economies of scale allow it to spread costs across different operations and thus make it more efficient. Considering the bulk of revenue contraction occurred in the United States, possibly due to spreading tariff fears in the consumer discretionary sector, this should already be factored in. Moving forward, a more confident consumer in the United States could push that revenue figure for North America higher, building on top of the 41% revenue growth seen in the international segment. With all these tailwinds in mind, backing the expected upside and EPS growth, there is one last factor to consider here. Markets are now willing to pay up to 132.6x in a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for Celsius stock, a long way above the rest of the industry’s 18.1x average. The market’s pricing mechanism is always willing to place a premium on those companies that can outgrow their peers and the broader S&P 500, and this time, Celsius justifies that premium.

Disney’s Iger-Led Turnaround Gains Traction,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/disneys-iger-led-turnaround-gains-traction/,"The Walt Disney Company NYSE: DIS faces headwinds in 2025, as do most businesses, but the Q2 results reveal the enduring strength of the brand and the impact of Bob Iger’s return. While revenue headwinds persist for this entertainment company, the company continues to grow, and profitability is improving. The critical detail is that profitability improved across key operating metrics, driving a significant bottom-line outperformance despite the tepid top-line. The takeaway for investors is that this company has regained its lost leverage, is well-positioned for an economic rebound, and the capital return outlook is rapidly improving. Disney’s stock price action declined following the FQ3 release, setting it up to rally as the calendar quarter progresses. The move took the market to a critical support level that aligns with prior resistance and key moving averages, and support appears to be present. The market may consolidate at this level, but assuming no new low is set, a new high is likely to occur soon. The moving averages have formed a Golden Crossover, indicating a shift in market dynamics from a less-bullish to a more-bullish posture, which is a signal to buy.  Disney didn’t have an easy time in Q2, but its diversified business model and refocus on quality are paying off. The $23.65 billion in net revenue is up 2.1% compared to last year, with strength in Entertainment and Experiences offsetting Sports. Entertainment grew by only 1%, led by an 8% increase in Experiences and offset by a 5% decline in Sports. Within the Entertainment segment, DTC and licensing are the standouts, while in Experiences, the domestic parks led the strength. The only bad news is that the analysts had been expecting a little more. The margin news is also mixed, with one segment contracting and the others expanding. The net result is that EBIT grew by 4%, segment operating income by 8%, adjusted earnings by 16%, cash from operations by 41%, and free cash flow by 51%, with adjusted earnings outpacing the consensus by nearly 1200 basis points. The guidance echoes the clear sign of strength, which is why this stock is a buy in Q3. Given the underlying strengths, the company raised its full-year profit targets to a range above the consensus and may exceed the target. The focus on streaming and sports is a reason to bet on Disney’s long-term stock price recovery. The company is integrating Hulu and Disney+, making it a more attractive and comprehensive streaming solution, and rationalizing its ESPS networks. ESPN's focus includes acquiring the NFL’s media assets and integrating them into the streaming portfolio. Bob Iger’s impact on the business is visible in the balance sheet. Highlights include reduced cash, which is balanced by steady assets, decreased debt and total liabilities, and a 7% rise in equity. The increase in equity is especially significant considering the share buybacks, which lowered the share count by 1.2%, effectively using cash while increasing shareholder value. The buybacks and dividend payments are expected to continue steadily through the end of the year and into next year. The dividend remains reliable at less than 20% of forecasted earnings and is expected to rise in 2026. The analyst and institutions are bullish on Disney’s turnaround and capital return. The 24 analysts tracked by MarketBeat rate the stock as Moderate Buy with bullish bias, see it advancing to a multiyear high in 2025, and the institutions are buying on balance. The institutional activity provides a strong tailwind for the market, owning 66% of the stock and buying at a two-to-one pace in Q3. Before you consider Walt Disney, you'll want to hear this.

FDA flags problems with two Boston Scientific heart devices tied to injuries and deaths,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/fda-flags-problems-with-two-boston-scientific-heart-devices-tied-to-injuries-and-deaths-2025-08-06/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. health regulators are warning doctors and patients about safety issues with two separate Boston Scientific heart devices recently linked to injuries and deaths. The Food and Drug Administration issued two alerts Wednesday about electrical problems tied to the company's heart-zapping defibrillator systems and a separate issue with a heart implant used to reduce stroke risk. The agency said some of the company's Endotak Reliance defibrillator wires can become calcified, leading to failures in delivering life-saving shocks to the heart, according to the FDA. Defibrillators are surgically placed in the upper chest, where they monitor irregular heartbeats and use electrical shocks to jolt the heart back to normal. As of July 24, Boston Scientific has reported 386 serious injuries and 16 deaths associated with this issue, the agency said. Ten of the deaths were judged to be due to the device failing to function properly, the company said in an email. Four were linked to attempts to surgically remove the devices from patients and two others were deemed unrelated to the implants. Boston Scientific's wires were distributed between 2002 and 2021 and are no longer available, the company noted in its letter to doctors. Some patients will need to have the devices replaced, though physicians should weigh the risks of the removal procedure. In a separate notice, the FDA said Boston Scientific recently updated instructions for implanting its Watchman device, which closes a portion of the heart's left atrium to reduce the risk of stroke. In a letter to physicians, the company noted that there is an increased risk of blockages in the bloodstream depending on the level of anesthesia for patients undergoing the initial implantation procedure. Watchman is an alternative to long-term treatment with blood thinners for patients at increased risk of stroke. As of July 30, the company has reported 120 serious injuries and 17 deaths related to the issue, the FDA said. A company investigation concluded that the safety issue “is not associated with the design or manufacture of any component of the Watchman system. Heart devices, including defibrillators and other implants, are Boston Scientific’s largest business, making up two-thirds of its $5 billion in revenue for the most recent quarter. Shares of Boston Scientific Corp. fell nearly 1.8 percent Wednesday to close at $102.95 in trading. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

"Joby Deal Gives Blade New Direction, But Stock Lacks Lift",https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/joby-deal-gives-blade-new-direction-but-stock-lacks-lift/,"It’s been quite the week for Blade Air Mobility Inc. NASDAQ: BLDE. On August 4, Blade and Joby Aviation Inc. NYSE: JOBY announced the sale of Blade’s passenger mobility business to Joby for up to $125 million. That sent BLDE stock soaring 30%. Blade will become a pure-play medical logistics company and change its name to Strata Critical Medical. However, the stock has given up most of those gains after the company delivered a mixed earnings report. Although it beat on the top line, it delivered negative earnings per share of five cents, which was a penny worse than the negative four cents analysts were expecting. The earnings report is a reminder that Blade has tremendous potential and serves a critical niche among business services stocks. However, the company is not yet profitable, and it may take some time for it to realize the economic benefits from the Joby deal. Blade Air Mobility operates as two divisions: Medical and Blade Passenger. The medical division is primarily comprised of its MediMobility Organ Transport business. The company is the largest dedicated air transporter of human organs for transplant in the United States. As of this quarter’s earnings, nearly 60% of the company’s revenue and 84% of its EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) came from its medical division. In the quarter, Blade posted 18% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth from the medical division. This contrasts with the combined 8% YOY revenue decline in its short-distance and Jets business in the passenger division. The company’s earnings report was heavily focused on the impact of the Joby deal on Blade’s business. Management was bullish on the outlook, citing an expectation for “continued attractive organic growth over the coming years.” The company also said it plans to pursue strategic acquisitions with the expected $200 million of cash on hand, pro forma for selling its passenger business. In short, investors can expect a leaner company with more predictable cash flows, focused on non-emergency medical transport (NEMT), organ transfer, and time-critical healthcare logistics. As the company’s quarterly results bear out, this is a less volatile space compared to urban air travel. The sale of Blade’s passenger business to Joby is for “up to” $125 million. That’s because the sale will be paid entirely in Joby stock. On the company’s earnings call, Blade’s management didn’t express concern over Joby’s ability to deliver. That said, a deal based on a stock-based structure opens the possibility that Joby’s share price could impact Blade's final payout. This risk is somewhat amplified because Blade's chief executive officer (CEO), Rob Wiesenthal, remarked that the deal will close in the first half of 2026. That’s not an unusual timeline for a deal involving regulatory approvals. However, it does extend the runway for stock price volatility, particularly for a pre-revenue aviation startup like Joby. What Blade might be (i.e., a profitable, asset-light medical mobility company) is enticing. The company estimates the organ logistics market to be an addressable market worth about $1 billion, of which Blade already controls about 30%. But that’s not where the company is today. It’s also not what attracted some initial investors to the company. Those investors were attracted to the opportunity in air mobility. While the resulting company may offer stability and near-term profits, the upside will likely be capped. Until its passenger business is sold, investors should expect BLDE stock to reflect cautious optimism at best. However, it's likely to be choppy as traders look for opportunities for short-term gains. Investors with a lower risk tolerance may want to wait until the deal is closer to completion before deciding on BLDE stock. However, risk-tolerant investors may want to start building a position and scale in as the final details of the deal emerge. Before you consider Blade Air Mobility, you'll want to hear this.

Trump once hailed mRNA vaccines as a 'medical miracle.' Now RFK Jr. is halting advancement,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-once-hailed-mrna-vaccines-as-a-medical-miracle-now-rfk-jr-is-halting-advancement-2025-08-06/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump hailed as a “medical miracle” the mRNA vaccines developed to combat the deadly COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Now, his health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is effectively halting the vaccine technology’s advancement. Kennedy announced Tuesday that the federal government is canceling $500 million worth of mRNA research development contracts, putting an end to U.S.-backed hopes for the vaccine technology to prevent future pandemics, treat cancer or prevent flu infections. It's a sharp pivot from how Trump and top officials described the technology during his first term. Here's a look at what Trump and some of his closest advisers have said about mRNA vaccines that were credited with slowing the pandemic five years ago. “A COVID-19 vaccine is the thing that will get Americans back to normal everyday life,” said Redfield, in a Sept. 16, 2020, statement. Americans were still donning face masks as one of the few ways of protecting themselves from a virus that had killed nearly 200,000 in just over six months. Redfield promised that the new vaccines — developed for the first time using mRNA technology — would offer a return to normalcy. “Don’t let Joe Biden take credit for the vaccines ... because the vaccines were me, and I pushed people harder than they’ve ever been pushed before .. The vaccines are — there are those that say it’s one of the greatest things. It’s a medical miracle.” Trump said on Nov. 26, 2020, during a news conference in the White House. Weeks earlier, Trump had lost the election in a bitter race against Democrat Joe Biden. As the Republican grappled with leaving Washington and continued to plan for the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccines, he reminded reporters that he oversaw the development of the new shots. “They say it’s somewhat of a miracle and I think that’s true,” Trump said on Dec. 8, 2020, during a speech at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. The event celebrated “Operation Warp Speed,"" the government-funded project that accelerated vaccine development with pharmaceutical companies. Trump was promoting the shots as the government prepared to offer them to frontline health workers. “It's clear that many Americans are learning these vaccines are safe and extraordinarily effective,” Azar said on Dec. 16, 2020, at a news conference. The government was shipping out mRNA vaccines to states, preparing to distributed it to the masses. Azar noted that a vast majority of Americans — between 70% to 80%, according to polls — intended to get the new COVID-19 vaccine that would be available to the public in the coming months. “It takes somewhere between five and 10 years to put a vaccine on the street. Look what we did. Now, that’s because of the great work of the scientists who had done the research on mRNA vaccines and others because of industry working on this, they just didn’t wake up one day and start working on it,” Perna said during a podcast interview that aired on May 9, 2023. Reflecting in an interview about his time overseeing “Operation Warp Speed,” Perna credited the mRNA technology with the government's ability to get shots in arms mere months after the pandemic started claiming lives in the U.S. in 2020. “Take credit because we saved tens of millions of lives. Take credit. Don’t let them take that away from you,” Trump said on Dec. 19, 2021 during a live interview with former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly. Daily COVID-19 deaths had ticked down to 1,500 compared to 3,000 from a year earlier after Americans began receiving their first doses of the mRNA vaccines. Trump revealed to O’Reilly and the audience that he had just gotten a COVID-19 booster. The crowd booed. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

More Than Yield: 5 Stocks Beating the Market and Hiking Dividends,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/more-than-yield-5-stocks-beating-the-market-and-hiking-dividends/,"While high dividend yields are enticing to many investors, the more relevant measurement of success of any stock is its total return. Total return includes a stock's dividend yield, as well as the change in share price. These two sources of return often work against each other; as shares fall, dividend yields rise, and vice versa. Below, we’ll detail five stocks that are working to deliver on both return sources. They are performing well in 2025, with their total returns beating out the overall market. They are also making strong progress in boosting their dividends, with all five recently announcing significant dividend increases of 10% or more. On July 24, Comfort Systems USA NYSE: FIX announced a 10% increase to its quarterly dividend. Its new $0.50 payment will be payable on Aug. 25 to shareholders of record on Aug. 15. Despite this significant increase, the stock has an indicated dividend yield of just under 0.3%. However, the company’s low dividend yield hasn’t come due to a lack of effort to raise it. Since the beginning of 2022, Comfort Systems has raised its dividend more than ten times, and its quarterly payout has nearly quadrupled. However, the firm’s dividend boosts simply haven’t been able to keep up with the stock’s more than 600% rise since the beginning of 2022, pushing its yield down. In 2025 alone, shares are up around 64%. This surge in price reflects strong earnings momentum and investor confidence. While the yield remains low, the company’s consistent dividend growth signals a commitment to returning capital, making it attractive to long-term investors. Next up is Wingstop NASDAQ: WING. The stock has managed to perform well in 2025, providing a total return of nearly 28%. Shares spiked after the company's latest earnings. Wingstop saw its adjusted earnings per share increase in the quarter while analysts expected the figure to fall. Adding to the good news was that Wingstop announced an 11% increase in its quarterly dividend. The stock only has an indicated dividend yield of just over 0.3%, but Wingstop has made strong progress in growing its dividend over the past three years. Its quarterly payout has increased by a compound annual growth rate of more than 16% over that period. Wingstop’s strong performance reflects growing investor confidence and robust earnings momentum. Its consistent dividend increases—even with a modest yield—demonstrate a clear commitment to returning capital and supporting shareholder value. For long-term investors, the combination of growth and income makes Wingstop a noteworthy holding. Healthcare stock McKesson NYSE: MCK also recently announced an increase to its dividend, boosting its quarterly payout by 15%. This raises the company’s dividend to 82 cents, which will be payable on Oct. 1 to stockholders of record on Sept. 2. The stock's indicated dividend yield now sits at just under 0.5%. Still, the firm continues to announce big-time dividend increases year after year. This most recent raise marks the fourth year in a row the company has boosted its dividend by 15%, showing its increasing commitment to returning capital to shareholders. Impressively, McKesson stock has provided a total return of around 23% in 2025. McKesson’s track record of raising its dividend at a steady pace underscores its financial strength and commitment to shareholders. Even with a modest yield, the consistency of these increases adds long-term value. Coupled with its solid performance in 2025, the stock remains a strong healthcare sector performer. On July 24, Encompass Health NYSE: EHC announced a nearly 12% increase to its dividend, boosting its quarterly payment to 19 cents per share. The new dividend is payable on Oct. 15 to holders of record on Oct. 1, and gives the stock an indicated dividend yield of 0.70%. Encompass has also managed to notch a total return of more than 18% in 2025. The company is gradually rebuilding its dividend after a significant cut in 2022, which followed the spin-off of part of its business. The consistent increases since then suggest a renewed focus on long-term capital returns. With operational stability improving, investors could see the dividend climb back toward pre-2022 levels. Last up is healthcare real estate investment trust (REIT) Welltower NYSE: WELL. The company is lifting its quarterly dividend by 10.4% to 74 cents per share. The company will pay this dividend on Aug. 21 to stockholders of record as of Aug. 12. The stock holds the highest indicated dividend yield on our list of just under 1.8%. Still, this yield is the lowest among large-cap U.S. healthcare REITs, whose average yield is approximately 5.1%. However, Welltower has also achieved by far the most impressive total return among that group in 2025 of over 33%. Investors appear to be rewarding the company’s improving fundamentals and consistent dividend growth. With the stock showing strong price performance, further yield compression is possible even as payouts rise. Overall, these five names are taking key steps when it comes to income generation: increasing their dividends. This is particularly important for these names, as they have seen significant share price appreciation recently. Dividend boosts help offset the decline in dividend yields that comes due to rising share prices. This gives these names the opportunity to have dividends as a meaningful part of their overall return profile going forward. Before you consider Comfort Systems USA, you'll want to hear this.

"Syria signs $14 billion in investment deals, including $4 billion airport expansion",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/syria-signs-14-billion-in-investment-deals-including-4-billion-airport-expansion-2025-08-06/,"DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — Syria signed agreements worth $14 billion with regional and international companies on Wednesday for 12 investment projects, including modernizing the international airport in Damascus and a new subway system, state media reported. The deals are the largest so far since foreign companies and countries started an investment push into the war-torn country after Western sanctions were eased following the fall of the 54-year rule of the Assad family. The head of Syria’s Investment Authority, Talal al-Halili, was quoted by state-run news agency SANA as saying that the expansion of Damascus’ International Airport will cost $4 billion and will be done by the Qatar-based UCC Holding. SANA said that the airport will be able to serve up to 31 million travelers a year, after the expansion. SANA added that the agreement for the new subway system in the capital is worth $2 billion, and the network is expected to be used by 750,000 people a day. The deal for the subway was signed by Syria’s Transportation Ministry and the United Arab Emirates’ National Investment Corporation, SANA said. Other projects include the $2 billion construction of 60 residential towers with 20,000 housing units outside of the capital. “Syria is open for investments and determined to build a bright future,” al-Hilali said during the ceremony, which was attended by President Ahmad al-Sharaa. In late July, Syria and Saudi Arabia announced 47 investment agreements, valued at more than $6 billion to mark a significant step in rebuilding Syria’s war-battered economy. In May, Syria signed an agreement with a consortium of Qatari, Turkish and U.S. companies for the development of a $7 billion 5,000-megawatt energy project to revitalize much of Syria’s war-battered electricity grid. “The future of a prosperous and peaceful Syria is in the hands of Syria and its regional partners,” said the U.S. special envoy to Syria, Tom Barrack, who attended Wednesday’s signing in Damascus.
