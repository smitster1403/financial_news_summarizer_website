US-China trade talks: Can China reduce its export dependence?,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/us-china-trade-talks-can-china-reduce-its-export-dependence-2025-07-26/,"BEIJING (AP) — China’s high dependence on exports will likely be a key focus of a new round of U.S.-China trade talks this coming week in Stockholm, but a trade deal would not necessarily help Beijing to rebalance its economy. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said he hopes the negotiations can take up this issue, along with China's purchases of oil from Russia and Iran, which undercut American sanctions on those two countries. Hopes rose for a breakthrough in talks after U.S. President Donald Trump announced deals with Japan, Indonesia and the Philippines this week. The U.S. wants China to do two things: Reduce what both the U.S. and the European Union see as excess production capacity in many industries, including steel and electric vehicles. And secondly, to take steps to increase spending by Chinese consumers so the economy relies more on domestic demand and less on exports. “We could also discuss the elephant in the room, which is this great rebalancing that the Chinese need to do,” Bessent told financial news network CNBC. He said China's share of global manufacturing exports at nearly 30%, “can’t get any bigger, and it should probably shrink.” The issues are not new, and China has been working to address them for years, more for domestic reasons than to reduce its trade surpluses with the U.S. and other countries. Bessent's predecessor as treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, made industrial policy a focus of a trip to China last year. She blamed government subsidies for flooding the global market with “artificially cheap Chinese products.” The European Union, whose top leaders met their Chinese counterparts in Beijing on Thursday, has cited subsidies to justify EU tariffs on electric vehicles made in China. In the 1980s, the U.S. pressured Japan to boost consumer spending when American manufacturing was overwhelmed by exports from the likes of Toyota and Sony. Economists have long argued that China likewise needs to transform into a more consumer-driven economy. Consumer spending accounts for less than 40% of China’s economy, versus close to 70% in the United States and about 54% in Japan. Chinese leaders have spoken about both factory overcapacity and weak consumer spending as long-term problems and have sought over the past 20 years to find ways to rebalance the economy away from export manufacturing and massive investments in dams, roads, railways and other infrastructure. Fierce price wars have prompted critical reports in official media saying that companies are “racing to the bottom,” skimping on quality and even safety to reduce costs. With strong government support, they've also expanded overseas, where they can charge higher prices but still undercut local competitors, creating a political backlash. All that competition and price cutting has left China battling deflation, or falling prices. When companies receive less for their products, they tend to invest less. That can lead to job cuts and lower wages, sapping business activity and spending power — contrary to the long-term goal of increasing the share of consumer spending in driving overall growth. To counter that, the government is spending billions on rebates and subsidies for people who trade in their cars or appliances for new ones. But acknowledging a problem and solving it are two different things. Economists say more fundamental changes are needed to boost consumption and rein in overcapacity. Such changes can only come incrementally over time. Private Chinese companies and foreign-invested companies create the most jobs, but they've suffered from swings in policy and pressures from the trade war, especially since the pandemic. Demographic changes are another challenge as China's population shrinks and ages. Many experts advocate expanding China's social safety net, health insurance, pensions and other support systems, so that people would feel freer to spend rather than save for a medical emergency or retirement. Yan Se, an economist at Peking University's Guanghua School of Management, warned at a recent forum that deflation will become a long-term issue if China doesn't step up its welfare benefits. “Chinese people deserve a better life,"" he said. One possibility, put forward at the same forum by Liu Qiao, the dean of the business school, would be to change incentives for local government officials, rewarding them for raising consumption or household incomes instead of meeting an economic growth target. He doesn't see that happening nationwide but said it could be tested in a province. “That would send out a message that China needs a different approach,” he said. Chinese leader Xi Jinping has made transforming the country into a technology superpower a top priority. It's a goal that has gained urgency as the U.S. has tightened restrictions on China's access to high-end semiconductors and other advanced knowhow. Output in high-tech manufacturing is growing quickly, adding to potential overcapacity, just as what happened with the government's encouragement of “green” technologies such as solar panels and wind turbines. Various industries, including EV makers, have pledged to address the issue, but some local governments are striving to keep money-losing enterprises afloat, reluctant to lose tax revenues and jobs, or to fail to meet economic growth targets. Going forward, the government is calling for more coordination of economic development polices in fields such as artificial intelligence so that not every province champions the same industry. But government moves to counter the impact of higher tariffs tend to support sectors already in overcapacity, and the share of consumption in the economy has fallen in recent years. “A sustained improvement in household consumption will require greater reform ambition,” the World Bank said in its most recent update on China's economy."" ___ AP Business Writer Elaine Kurtenbach in Bangkok contributed to this report.

Policy officially takes over for Murphy as president/CEO at Packers' shareholders meeting,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/policy-officially-takes-over-for-murphy-as-presidentceo-at-packers-shareholders-meeting-2025-07-25/,"GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) — Ed Policy began his tenure as the Green Bay Packers’ president/CEO by paying tribute to his predecessor. Policy officially took over for Mark Murphy on Friday as the NFL’s only publicly owned franchise held its annual shareholders meeting. During Murphy’s 17 seasons on the job, the Packers made 13 playoff appearances, with the 2010 team winning a Super Bowl. “I assure you that going forward I’m going to lean heavily on your example and your pearls of wisdom as I move the organization into the future,” Policy said. Murphy is stepping down because he reached the franchise’s mandatory retirement age of 70 earlier this month. Murphy said he felt he could continue meeting the demands of this position but added that he agrees with the Packers’ retirement policy. “In my career – business and with the league and others – you see examples where maybe people stay on a little too long, so I think this serves the Packers well,” Murphy said. Policy, 54, didn’t focus much on his own plans during the shareholders meeting, which instead pretty much served as a testimonial for Murphy. There were plenty of shouts of “Thank you, Mark,” among the 6,529 shareholders in the Lambeau Field stands. On a hot afternoon, many shareholders tried to cool themselves off by waving fans that featured Murphy’s face. A tribute video included messages from NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and former commissioner Paul Tagliabue among others. Murphy signed autographs and greeted fans after the Packers’ Friday morning practice and again after the shareholders meeting. “It’s a little bittersweet,” Murphy said. “Obviously, I’m a very appreciative and I also feel honored, too, that the fans have been so supportive of me and the organization. But (I’m) really excited too for the future of the organization and for Ed in particular.” The Packers say Murphy, who played defensive back for Washington from 1977-84, is believed to be the only person to earn a Super Bowl ring both as a player and as a team’s chief executive. He was on Washington’s 1982 championship team. His stint as Green Bay’s president/CEO included the construction of Titletown, a 45-acre development adjacent to Lambeau Field that features shops, restaurants and apartments. He capped his tenure earlier this year by welcoming the NFL Draft to Green Bay, an event that drew an announced three-day total attendance of 600,000. Murphy also presided over multiple renovations to Lambeau Field, including the opening of a new home locker room this week. “He’s been tremendous for us,” wide receiver Jayden Reed said. “I thanked him today, knowing this was his last day here, so I went up to him and I thanked him for everything. Without him, we wouldn’t be standing in this locker room right now. He’s been a tremendous help to all of us, very supportive. He gets this thing done. I appreciate him for that.” Murphy said he hopes to stay involved in the game and noted that he’s talked to Goodell about things he’d like to do on a league level. He also mentioned spending more time with his family and increasing his involvement in his charity work and in the golf course he owns at Baileys Harbor, Wisconsin. The Packers’ board of directors unanimously selected Policy as Murphy’s replacement after a search committee recommended him last year. Policy, the son of former San Francisco 49ers and Cleveland Browns president, joined the Packers as vice president and general counsel in August 2012 and was promoted to chief operating officer in January 2018. “I want to thank you, our owners, for investing so much in me over the past 13 years,” Policy told the shareholders. “It’s been really special, and I intend to pay it back with results both on and off the field.” Packers coach Matt LaFleur, general manager Brian Gutekunst and executive vice president/director of player operations Russ Ball report to the president/CEO under the team’s leadership structure. All three of them have two years remaining on their contracts. Policy said earlier this year he has no plans to extend those contracts before this season, though he praised all three men and noted his long working relationships with them. “(I’m) certainly going to miss Mark and everything that he’s done for this place, but feel like we’re in great hands with a guy like Ed Policy,” LaFleur said. Murphy was asked what advice he had for Policy. “The one thing I told him is he’s got to be himself,” Murphy said. “I’ve seen him grow quite a bit as a leader. The search ended up with him. They did a great job. There’s no question he’s positioned and ready to have success. “He and I have talked about it. Don’t be afraid to change things. Follow your instincts. He’s got really good business sense. Hopefully we put him in a position where he can have success not only in the short term but the long term of the organization.” NOTES: LaFleur said OL Aaron Banks is “day to day” with a back issue. … Rookie WR Savion Williams didn’t practice Friday due to a concussion. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

Paramount gets green light for $8 billion merger. But what is the psychic cost for company?,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/paramount-gets-green-light-for-8-billion-merger-but-what-is-the-psychic-cost-for-company-2025-07-25/,"With this week’s FCC approval, the merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media is expected to be completed in the coming weeks at a value of $8 billion. The question for the new company is whether the psychic cost is much higher. It has been a particularly rough few months at Paramount-owned CBS, where the settlement of a lawsuit regarding “60 Minutes” and announced end of Stephen Colbert's late-night show has led critics to suggest corporate leaders were bowing to President Donald Trump. Following the Federal Communications Commission approval Thursday, one of the triumvirate of current Paramount leaders, Chris McCarthy, said that he would be leaving the company. McCarthy has been in charge of fading cable properties like MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon, expected to bear the brunt of an estimated $2 billion in cost cuts identified by Skydance leaders. Skydance head David Ellison is expected to head the new company, and he has identified former NBC Universal executive Jeff Shell as the incoming president. After the merger's Aug. 7 closing date, the new leaders will be watched most closely for how they deal with CBS News, particularly given the $16 million paid in a settlement of Trump's complaint that last fall's “60 Minutes” interview was edited to make opponent Kamala Harris look good. Two news executives — News CEO Wendy McMahon and “60 Minutes” executive producer Bill Owens — resigned due to their opposition to the deal. The appointment of respected insider Tanya Simon to replace Owens this week was seen as a positive sign by people at “60 Minutes.” Days before the FCC's vote, Paramount agreed to hire an ombudsman at CBS News with the mission of investigating complaints of political bias. “In all respects, Skydance will ensure that CBS's reporting is fair, unbiased, and fact-based,” Skydance said in a letter to FCC Chairman Brendan Carr. The role of an ombudsman, or public editor, who examines a news outlet's work is often positive — if they are given independence, said Kelly McBride, an ethics expert who has had that role at NPR for five years. “You really want the person to have loyalty only to their own judgment and the journalistic mission of the organization,” she said. Having the sole mission of examining bias could be problematic, however. To be fair, a journalist's work should be closely studied before making that determination, not judged on the basis of one report or passage, she said. Carr, in an interview with CNBC on Friday, said the role “should go a long way toward restoring America's trust in media.” Anna Gomez, an FCC commissioner who voted to reject the deal on Thursday, interpreted the arrangement as a way for the government to control journalists. “They want the news media to report on them in a positive light or in the light that they want,” Gomez told MSNBC. “So they don't want the media to do their job, which is to hold government to account without fear or favor.” According to published reports, Ellison has explored purchasing The Free Press, a flourishing news site founded by Bari Weiss perhaps best known for a former NPR editor's study of liberal bias in public broadcasting. An Ellison spokeswoman did not return a message seeking comment on Friday. Colbert's slow-motion firing — he'll work until the end of his contract next May — was described by CBS as a financial decision given late-night television's collapsing economics. Colbert's relentless lampooning of Trump, and his criticism of the “60 Minutes” settlement, led to suspicion of those motives. “Was this really financial?” comic Jon Stewart wondered. ""Or maybe the path of least resistance for your $8 billion merger was killing a show that you know rankled a fragile and vengeful president?” Stewart's profane criticism on his own Paramount-owned show may provide its own test for Skydance. “The Daily Show” is one of the few original programs left on Comedy Central, and his contract ends later this year. In an odd way, Comedy Central's “South Park” buttresses CBS' claim that the Colbert decision was financial, not political. Creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone delivered an episode this week that depicted a naked Trump in bed with the devil. Paramount just signed Parker and Stone to a new $1.5 billion deal that Skydance executives surely cleared; it makes the entire “South Park” library available for streaming on Paramount+. a platform where Colbert's show doesn't do nearly as well. Figuring out what to do with others at Paramount's cable networks, or even the networks as a whole, will be an early decision for Ellison, son of multibillionaire and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison. “There is a clear opportunity to improve Paramount's growth profile by letting those assets go,” analyst Doug Creutz of TD Securities told investors Friday. “On the other hand, we suspect the Ellisons did not purchase Paramount in order to break it up for parts.” The merger also brings together the Paramount movie studio with one of its most regular partners. David Ellison has been one of the industry's top investors and producers since founding Skydance in 2006. Ellison has a challenge here, too: Years of uncertainty over its future and modest investment in its movie pipeline has shrunk Paramount's market share to last among the major studios. The Paramount+ streaming service has been a money-loser. To revive Paramount, Ellison will look to revamp its streaming operations, leverage its franchises and try to bolster family content. ___ AP Film Writer Jake Coyle contributed to this report.

Tea said that about 72,000 images were leaked online, including 13,000 images of selfies or selfies featuring a photo identification that users submitted during account verification. Another 59,000 images publicly viewable in the app from posts, comments and direct messages were also accessed without authorization, according to a Tea spokesperson. No email addresses or phone numbers were accessed, the company said, and the breach only affects users who signed up before February 2024. “Tea has engaged third-party cybersecurity experts and are working around the clock to secure its systems,” the company said. “At this time, there is no evidence to suggest that additional user data was affected. Protecting tea users’ privacy and data is their highest priority.” Tea presents itself as a safe way for women to anonymously vet men they might connect with on dating apps such as Tinder or Bumble — ensuring that your date is “safe, not a catfish, and not in a relationship.” “Tea is a must-have app, helping women avoid red flags before the first date with dating advice, and showing them who’s really behind the profile of the person they’re dating,” reads Tea's app store description. 404 Media, which earlier reported the breach, said it was 4Chan users who discovered an exposed database that “allowed anyone to access the material"" from Tea. “While reporting this story, a URL the 4chan user posted included a voluminous list of specific attachments associated with the Tea app. 404 Media saw this list of files.

3 Stocks Flying Under the S&P 500 Radar,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/3-stocks-flying-under-the-s-and-p-500-radar/,"The S&P 500 is the benchmark index used by most investors. In fact, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust NYSEARCA: SPY is one of the most widely held index funds for passive investors. Investing in the SPY has been a good strategy in the last few years as mega-cap technology stocks dominated the market. This had the added benefit of giving investors exposure to themes like industrial automation, artificial intelligence (AI), and semiconductors. However, as the market rally broadens into other sectors, focusing only on those names can introduce investors to more risk and less reward than they may think. The SPY is a market-cap weighted index, which means it will buy the stocks with the highest market capitalizations, independent of any other fundamentals. As of July 24, its two largest holdings are NVIDIA Corp. NASDAQ: NVDA and Microsoft Corp. NASDAQ: MSFT. The good news is that investors benefit from the positive momentum in these stocks. However, that growth comes at a premium, and investors may not capture faster-growing stocks. Investors looking to diversify their portfolio should consider the opportunities in small-cap and international stocks. These can offer higher growth potential, especially at the beginning of a long-term innovation cycle like what is happening with AI. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are an emerging story. Companies such as Tesla Inc. NASDAQ: TSLA and Alphabet Inc. NASDAQ: GOOGL have launched fleets of their robotaxis and Waymo AVs in select markets around the world. Now, the question is one of scale. In the case of Waymo, that will mean LiDAR technology. Investors see that opportunity in a company like Aeva Technologies Inc. NASDAQ: AEVA. With a market cap of $1.3 billion, it’s not the biggest name in the LiDAR space. However, the company differentiates itself with a 4D LiDAR system that measures distance and velocity using a unique Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) technology. The ability to measure velocity is a key advancement in LiDAR technology and allows Aeva to notch several contracts in the autonomous vehicle space in 2025. This is not contributing to revenue yet, but investors are looking past that. AEVA stock is up 401% in 2025. In June and July, analysts from Roth Capital and Oppenheimer raised their price targets on the stock. However, the stock is down 20% in the last month suggesting that short interest over 17% is weighing on the stock. Ouster Inc. NYSE: OUST is an example of why there’s enough room in the autonomous vehicle space for several competitors. In the case of Ouster, it’s not how the company is executing on LiDAR technology; it’s where. Ouster is focusing on defense, robotics, and industrial automation markets. In June, the company’s digital LiDAR was approved by the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) for unmanned aircraft. This aligns with the Pentagon's plans to use the increased defense spending coming after the One Big, Beautiful Bill passed through Congress. However, the revenue from these projects will take time to be realized. That’s why investors may need to wait for a better entry point. As of this writing, OUST stock is up approximately 126% in 2025 and over 258% in the last three months. It’s well above its consensus price target as animal spirits are taking over the market. Nevertheless, the company’s upcoming earnings in August could give the bulls the upper hand. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing NYSE: TSM is hardly a small-cap company. With a market cap of over $1.25 trillion, the Taiwan-based chip foundry is one of the largest companies in the chip sector. It’s also one of the best-performing stocks and has room to run. A key reason for investors to believe in the company’s growth is its contracts with Apple Inc. NASDAQ: AAPL, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. NASDAQ: AMD and NVIDIA. With few competitors to threaten its leadership, Taiwan Semiconductor will continue to be at the heart of chip manufacturing. TSM stock is up 22% in 2025, but the focus is likely on what’s next. The company delivered a strong earnings report on July 17 with revenue up 50% year-over-year (YOY) and earnings per share (EPS) up 66% YOY. Institutional investors continue to invest in the company despite geopolitical concerns, fueling the stock's bullish outlook.

Qualcomm's Next Gear: A Growth Story Wall Street Might Be Missing,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/qualcomms-next-gear-a-growth-story-wall-street-might-be-missing/,"Qualcomm NASDAQ: QCOM heads into its third-quarter earnings report on July 30, and Wall Street will be watching closely. For years, the company has served as a key indicator for the health of the mobile industry, with its fortunes closely tied to smartphone sales. However, investors who focus only on handset numbers risk missing a fundamental and exciting transformation. A multi-year strategy to diversify the business is now bearing significant fruit. Qualcomm is aggressively expanding into high-growth sectors, building a more resilient company that is less dependent on the cyclical smartphone market. This successful pivot is creating a compelling new investment case centered on the future of automotive technology, artificial intelligence (AI) powered PCs, and the vast possibilities of the Internet of Things (IoT). One of the clearest signs of Qualcomm’s evolution is its accelerating growth in the automotive industry. This segment is quickly becoming a primary engine for the company, delivering impressive financial results and building a foundation for long-term, predictable revenue. In its second fiscal quarter, Qualcomm's automotive revenues reached $959 million, representing a remarkable 59% increase from the same period last year. The Snapdragon Digital Chassis platform drives this growth. It is a comprehensive suite of solutions that automakers use to power digital cockpits, in-car connectivity, and Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS). This platform approach makes Qualcomm an essential technology partner in the modern software-defined vehicle. To further secure its position, Qualcomm completed its acquisition of Autotalks in June 2025. This move integrates industry-leading Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication technology into its portfolio, a cornerstone for future autonomous driving and road safety systems. For investors, these long-term automotive design wins provide a stable and growing revenue stream, directly offsetting the volatility of the consumer phone market and supporting the company's goal of achieving $8 billion in annual automotive revenue. Qualcomm's expansion goes well beyond the car. The company’s IoT segment, which grew 27% year-over-year to $1.6 billion in Q2, has become a launchpad for entering new device categories, most notably the AI PC. With its Snapdragon X Elite processors, Qualcomm has emerged as a serious competitor in a market long dominated by legacy players. These chips offer key advantages in power efficiency and on-device AI processing, enabling a new generation of laptops with multi-day battery life. This is already translating into market share. In the first calendar quarter of 2025, Snapdragon-powered devices captured approximately 9% of the premium Windows laptop market in the U.S. and key European countries. Qualcomm's vision for the intelligent edge is also pushing into the data center. The company's recently announced plan to acquire Alphawave Semi OTCMKTS: AWEVF for approximately $2.4 billion provides critical high-speed connectivity technology, accelerating its expansion into a massive, high-margin market driven by global demand for AI. This, combined with new partnerships in industrial IoT, shows a clear strategy: to make Qualcomm's technology a fundamental part of the connected economy. For investors looking to validate this growth story, the upcoming earnings report offers a clear opportunity. Beyond the headline numbers, these specific metrics will signal if the diversification strategy is maintaining its powerful momentum: Qualcomm's successful pivot is reinforcing its financial strength and commitment to rewarding investors. With a trailing price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of approximately 16, the stock’s valuation suggests that the market may not yet be fully pricing in these durable, high-growth revenue streams. Wall Street is taking note, with a consensus 12-month analyst price target near $185, implying a potential upside of over 15% from its current price. Management is signaling its confidence through its actions. The company offers a healthy dividend yielding around 2.25% and has committed to returning 100% of its free cash flow to shareholders in fiscal 2025. This is a powerful statement of belief in the long-term cash-generating power of its new ventures. Qualcomm’s strategic execution has set it on a clear path to becoming a more balanced and diversified technology leader. While its legacy is in mobile, its future is being built in our cars, on our desks, and across the intelligent enterprise. The upcoming earnings report will be another key checkpoint in a compelling long-term growth story that is just getting started. Before you consider QUALCOMM, you'll want to hear this.

3 Cloud Build-Out Stocks Behind the AI Infrastructure Boom,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/3-cloud-build-out-stocks-behind-the-ai-infrastructure-boom/,"Investors continue to invest in technology stocks, particularly those with an artificial intelligence (AI) theme. However, for some investors, their choice of stocks to buy may be based on FOMO (fear of missing out) rather than allowing a deeper understanding of what’s happening in the tech space to inform their investment decisions. One area to consider is how cloud computing is changing. The idea of accessing data and running applications via the internet, as opposed to local computers and servers, is over 20 years old. However, it’s evolving fast to meet the needs of AI. This boils down to infrastructure. Data centers have been around for decades. However, generative (and now agentic) AI and machine learning require more of everything (power, cooling, network speed, and density). In many cases, hyperscalers like Microsoft Corp. NASDAQ: MSFT, Amazon.com Inc. NASDAQ: AMZN and Meta Platforms Inc. NASDAQ: META can’t just retrofit existing data centers. They have to be created from the ground up. This is the “cloud build-out,"" and it will take years and billions in capital expenditures to make it a reality. That's an investable theme every investor can understand and profit from today. Here are three companies supplying the building blocks of this new infrastructure. The case for Prologis Inc. NYSE: PLD is easy to understand. The first step in building a next-generation data center is finding land with power access and necessary permitting. Prologis is the global leader in logistics real estate. In its latest earnings report, Prologis announced a shift in focus to data centers and AI infrastructure hubs. The company is repurposing logistics-adjacent land and buying new property in power-rich areas that will support the needs of hyperscalers. PLD stock is up 4.1% in 2025 and continues to consolidate following its earnings on July 16. Analysts have a consensus price target of $119.67, which could provide an additional 8.75% upside in addition to a dividend yield of 3.67%. Plus, at 16x forward earnings, the company is attractively valued compared to its historical averages. Putting NVIDIA Corp. NASDAQ: NVDA seems too easy. However, NVIDIA provides a good starting point for looking at Super Micro Computer Inc. NASDAQ: SMCI. The company designs and builds high-performance server and storage systems tailored for AI, cloud, and enterprise computing. This includes NVIDIA GPUs, which are the current gold standard for generative AI workloads. Super Micro is growing rapidly with triple-digit revenue growth in recent quarters. There is growing speculation that Meta Platforms, Inc. NASDAQ: META will award Super Micro a contract to provide cooling services for its new data centers. This is a pure-play picks-and-shovels stock for the hardware that the cloud buildout will require. SMCI stock is up 69% in 2025, but investors should note that it is expensive to itself at around 27x forward earnings. Analysts give the stock a consensus price target of $42.89, which is 17% below its closing price on July 23. Just like many specialists (electricians, plumbers, painters) are needed to construct a house, the same is true of data centers. Super Micro provides the compute layer, but Arista Networks Inc. NYSE: ANET provides the networking layer. This includes the high-speed networking equipment that allows servers to communicate with each other. Arista already has contracts with companies such as Meta Platforms and Microsoft, making it the logical choice for these next-generation data centers. That positioning shows up in the company’s financials: Arista has high operating margins, a strong balance sheet, and consistent profitability. ANET stock has increased 59% in the last three months. That’s not surprising given the billions of dollars in capital expenditures announced by the hyperscalers during that time. More importantly, analysts are raising their price targets for the stock ahead of the company’s earnings in early August. Before you consider Arista Networks, you'll want to hear this.

Beer and food workers on strike at Fenway Park for homestand between Dodgers and Red Sox,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/beer-and-food-workers-on-strike-at-fenway-for-homestand-between-dodgers-and-red-sox-2025-07-25/,"BOSTON (AP) — Striking Fenway Park vendors banged on drums and shouted “Don't buy food!” while walking a picket line outside the home of the Boston Red Sox before Friday night's game against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Hundreds of Aramark workers marched along the street behind the team's right field concourse before the series opener, carrying round picket signs decorated with red baseball stitching. A giant inflatable rat shared the sidewalk with a statue of Red Sox greats Ted Williams, Bobby Doerr, Dom DiMaggio and Johnny Pesky. Another group of picketers circled behind home plate after the first pitch as Local 26 of the Massachusetts and Rhode Island hotel, casino, airport and food services workers union went on strike at noon on Friday. It posted on social media that it is asking for “living wages, guardrails on technology and R-E-S-P-E-C-T!” It's believed to be the first union walkout in the ballpark's 113-year-history. “Respect the picket line,"" the union posted. “We know tix are expensive, we’re not asking you to stay away from the home games. But we ARE asking you to not buy concessions. No purchase of pretzels, pickles or peanuts inside the ballpark during the homestand.” An Aramark spokesman said the company has bargained in good faith and is “disappointed the union rejected our latest offer and chose to call a strike.” “We are committed to delivering an outstanding fan experience and have contingency plans in place to ensure fans will not encounter service interruptions,” the company said. The Red Sox noted that the team was not involved in the negotiations but remained in contact with the concessionaire. Aramark made an offer as recently as Thursday night that was rejected by the union, the team said. “Aramark has implemented its contingency staffing plans, and fans can expect a full and uninterrupted ballpark experience this weekend, including access to all food, beverage, and hospitality services throughout Fenway Park,” the team said. ""We remain hopeful that the parties will reach a swift and fair resolution.” A Red Sox spokeswoman said after Friday night's game, a full house of 36,369, that “ballpark concessions performed at the expected levels consistent with tonight’s sold out crowd.” U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders called on the team to support the vendors. “Fenway Park is an iconic American institution, and it’s the workers there that make every Red Sox game special,” he posted on social media. “The team is extremely profitable. They should treat their employees with respect, pay them decent wages and negotiate a fair contract with the union.” Maggie McCue, a beer vendor with 19 years of experience who is 24 weeks pregnant with twins, took a break from marching in the near-90 degree temperatures to eat a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Her mother, also a beer vendor for almost two decades, said the team can afford for the workers to be paid a living wage. “They have more money than they need,” Marianne McCue said. “We are Fenway. Fenway is us. Some people have been here 40-something years and they're not even backing us up. Shame on them. I never thought that at 70 years old I would be on strike, but here we are."" The Red Sox play three games against the Dodgers before leaving town again for a series beginning Monday night in Minneapolis against the Twins. It was a chance for Boston fans to welcome back ex-Red Sox star Mookie Betts, who was traded to Los Angeles in a cost-cutting move a year after winning the AL MVP. Now, with Betts returning to town, the vendors are looking to get paid. “It's come full circle,” Maggie McCue said. “Full circle.” ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

Pakistan urges global social media platforms to block accounts run by banned militant groups,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/pakistan-urges-global-social-media-platforms-to-block-accounts-run-by-banned-militant-groups-2025-07-25/,"ISLAMABAD (AP) — Pakistan on Friday urged global social media companies to take action to block hundreds of accounts allegedly run by outlawed militant groups that Islamabad claims spread propaganda and glorify insurgents in the South Asian country. According to Pakistan’s Deputy Interior Minister Talal Chaudhry, groups such as the Pakistani Taliban and the separatist Balochistan Liberation Army — banned by the Pakistani authorities and also designated as terrorist groups by the United States — have been using X, Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Telegram to promote violence in Pakistan. Chaudhry, who spoke to reporters at a news conference, urged the tech companies to remove or disable these accounts, as well as those run by supporters of the militant groups. Deputy Law Minister Aqeel Malik, who also spoke at the new conference, said Pakistani investigators have identified 481 accounts associated with the Pakistani Taliban, known as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan or TTP, and the Balochistan Liberation Army, or BLA. The accounts were being used to incite violence and spread hate speech, Malik said. There was no immediate response from any of the social media platforms to Pakistan's request. Pakistan itself has in recent years blocked access to X, primarily to curb criticism from supporters of imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan but also voices of other dissenters. The plea comes amid a surge in violence across Pakistan, much of it blamed on the two militant groups, as well as the Islamic State group. The Pakistani Taliban are allies but a separate militant group from the Afghan Taliban. However, the Taliban takeover of neighboring Afghanistan in 2021 has emboldened the TTP. Militant groups also heavily rely on social media platforms to claim responsibility for attacks against security forces and civilians in Pakistan.

Education Department says it will release billions in remaining withheld grant money for schools,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/education-department-says-it-will-release-billions-in-remaining-withheld-grant-money-for-schools-2025-07-25/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is releasing billions of dollars in withheld grants for schools, the Education Department said Friday, ending weeks of uncertainty for educators around the country who rely on the money for English language instruction, adult literacy, and other programs. President Donald Trump's administration had suspended more than $6 billion in funding on July 1, as part of a review to ensure spending aligned with the White House’s priorities. The funding freeze had been challenged by several lawsuits as educators, Congress members from both parties and others called for the administration to release the money. Congress had appropriated the money in a bill signed this year by Trump. Last week, the Education Department said it would release $1.3 billion of the money for after-school and summer programming. Without the money, school districts and nonprofits such as the YMCA and Boys and Girls Club of America had said they would have to close or scale back educational offerings this fall. The Office of Management and Budget had completed its review of the programs and will begin sending the money to states next week, the Education Department said. A group of 10 Republican senators on July 16 sent a letter imploring the administration to allow the frozen education money to be sent to states, saying the withheld money supported programs and services that are critical to local communities. “The programs are ones that enjoy longstanding, bipartisan support,” U.S. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., said Friday. She pointed to after-school and summer programs that allow parents to work while their children learn and classes that help adults gain new skills — contributing to local economies. In withholding the funds, the Office of Management and Budget had said some of the programs supported a “ radical leftwing agenda. ” “We share your concern,” the GOP senators had written. “However, we do not believe that is happening with these funds.” School superintendents had warned they would have to eliminate academic services without the money. On Friday, AASA, an association of superintendents, thanked members of Congress for pressing to release the money. In Harford County, Maryland, some of the withheld federal money made up more than half the budget for the district’s annual summer camp for kids learning English. The money helps the district hire certified teachers to staff the camp, incorporating learning into children's play for four weeks during the summer. The program helps kids keep their English and academic momentum over the summer. The district serves roughly 1,100 students who are non-native English speakers. Many of them are born in the U.S. to parents who came to the area seeking job opportunities, often in the restaurants and warehouses that have popped up in the past decades in the region northeast of Baltimore. During the school year, the soon-to-be-released federal money pays for tutors for kids learning English. On Thursday, more than 350 children filled the second floor of Bel Air High School for the second-to-last day of summer camp. Young learners crowded around an alphabet wheel, jostling with each other to push each letter button as they thought of foods starting with letters from A to Z. Middle school students watched a robotics team demonstration, and a few sheepishly raised their hands when asked if they would be interested in joining. High school student volunteers, some of whom had been campers learning English themselves not many years ago, helped the youngest children with art projects. The uncertainty around the funding was an unnecessary distraction for schools, said U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wa. “Instead of spending the last many weeks figuring out how to improve after-school options and get our kids’ reading and math scores up, because of President Trump, communities across the country have been forced to spend their time cutting back on tutoring options and sorting out how many teachers they will have to lay off,"" Murray said. The grants that were under review included $2 billion for teachers’ professional development and efforts to reduce class size; $1 billion for academic enrichment grants, often used for science and math education and accelerated learning; $890 million for students who are learning English; $376 million to educate the children of migrant workers; and $715 million to teach adults how to read. It added up to millions of dollars for the nation’s largest school districts. Data available from the Census for three of the grant programs — teacher development, academic enrichment, and bilingual education — shows the Los Angeles Unified School District, for example, received $62 million in the 2022-23 school year. Philadelphia’s school district got $28 million, while Miami’s got over $24 million. Smaller districts got more modest amounts, but they still would have represented sizable gaps in their budgets. For example, schools in Burlington, Vermont; Pine Bluff, Arkansas; and Norristown, Pennsylvania, each got more than $300 per student from the same three grant programs. ___ Associated Press writer Sharon Lurye in Philadelphia contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press’ education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

ServiceNow: The 2nd Wave of AI Spending Is Here,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/servicenow-the-2nd-wave-of-ai-spending-is-here/,"ServiceNow’s NYSE: NOW Q2 results and guidance update are a wow moment for investors and an eye-opener for those waiting on AI’s second wave. The second wave, the rise of agentic services and the application of AI, is expected to be a larger, faster-growing, and longer-sustained rally than infrastructure, which has been a rocket-ship of gains for technology investors. The takeaway today is that ServiceNow’s results outperformed guidance and analysts' consensus forecasts in all metrics. Guidance was improved to align with them, and the momentum indicates that outperformance is very likely. ServiceNow had a robust quarter considering its size. The megacap grew its revenue by 22.4% to over $3.2 billion, outperforming MarketBeat’s reported consensus by more than 300 basis points. The strength was driven by subscriptions and large clients, with subscription revenue up 22.5% and clients contributing more than $20 million in contract value, up 30%. Margin news is also good, with revenue leverage compounded by internal efficiency. The net result is that adjusted EPS grew by 30% compared to the 22.4% top-line growth and outperformed by an eye-popping margin. Outperformance topped 1450 basis points, and the strength is expected to continue in Q3 and the remainder of the year. The company raised its guidance for Q3, underpinning expectations for a strong year, forecasting about 20% growth compared to the prior year. The guidance is likely cautious, given the 22.4% top-line growth, accelerating deal volume, and improving quality, as well as the RPO, which outpaces revenue. The current remaining performance obligation is up 24.5%, and the total is up 29%, suggesting sustained, if not accelerating, growth as the year progresses. ServiceNow’s business is profitable, and it generates free cash flow. A portion is used to buy back shares, which is insufficient to offset dilution, but almost, and the remainder is for reinvestment. As of the end of Q2 2025, the company’s efforts resulted in increased cash and assets, steady net debt, low leverage, and increased equity. Equity improved by 13% YTD and will likely continue to grow as the year progresses. Regarding leverage, the company utilizes debt but has an investment-grade rating, resulting in relatively low costs. The net leverage in Q3 is about 0.1x the equity, which is a healthy ratio. Analysts are leading this market higher, providing support with increasing coverage, a firming sentiment, a Moderate Buy rating, and an uptrend in the consensus price target. The price target is a critical factor, having risen by more than 30% in the last year, with revisions leading to a high-end range. The high-end range is $1,300, affirmed by the post-release activity, which includes several price target increases issued within the first twelve hours. Likewise, the institutional trends are bullish. They own 87% of the stock and buy on balance every month in 2025, netting about $2 in shares for every $1 sold. ServiceNow’s stock price surged in the wake of the release but struggled to break through resistance at the top of the near-term range. Resistance at $1,050 may keep this market in check soon, but long-term trends suggest it won’t. Once crossed, the next target is near $1,150, and it may be reached quickly. Assuming that subsequent earnings reports align with the new guidance, analyst trends will remain bullish. New highs will be set, potentially reaching as high as the $1,300 level, representing a 30% gain.  Before you consider ServiceNow, you'll want to hear this.

Tractor Supply Revs Up on Forecast Hike and Bullish Signals,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/tractor-supply-revs-up-on-forecast-hike-and-bullish-signals/,"Tractor Supply Company’s NASDAQ: TSCO FQ2 earnings report affirmed the outlook for long-term share price increases, as indicated by the recent stock split. Due to their quality, stocks that split tend to trend higher over time, outperforming the broader market. Stock splits tend to happen with stocks whose prices have been trending higher to begin with. Uptrends are driven by business growth and improving shareholder value, so it only makes sense that the uptrend will continue afterward. Tractor Supply Company's uptrend is tied to store count growth, market penetration, and share gains as it leans into its Life Out Here strategy. Life Out Here serves underserved, less urbanized markets where the larger big-box stores are largely absent. Like other retailers, the company faces hurdles in 2025, but is navigating the environment effectively, generating ample cash flow to sustain its growth trajectory, maintain a healthy balance sheet, and return capital.  Capital return is a critical factor for this investment. TSCO stock is a buy-and-hold investment whose price action is supported by numerous factors, none of which tend to produce vigorous share price increases; rather, it exhibits steady share price growth over time. They include steady, stable, profitable business growth, an attractive dividend with an annually increasing distribution, and share repurchases. The dividend is safe and reliable, accounting for 45% of the earnings outlook, and is on track for robust annual increases. The distribution growth rate isn’t robust but is sustainable in the mid-to-low single-digit range and outpacing inflation. The share repurchases are significant. The company tempered its outlook for buybacks, reducing the annual forecast slightly in mid-July 2025, but it remains on track to purchase up to $375 million, a sustainable pace. The full-year forecast is worth approximately 1.1% of the pre-release market closing market cap, a solid pace but slower than the 1.6% decline posted for the June quarter. Tractor Supply Company’s analyst trends were bullish leading into the release and are likely to continue strongly in the back half. They included numerous price target increases, leading to the high-end range, aiding a 15% split-adjusted YOY increase in MarketBeat’s reported consensus and providing lift for the market. The consensus estimate lags in early Q3 but is rising, and the high-end range is leading to new highs. The company achieved 4.5% revenue growth, outperforming the market by 100 basis points. It maintained strong margins and updated its guidance. Executives expect revenue growth of 4% to 8%, a wide range but one whose midpoint is well above the 4.7% consensus. Regarding earnings, the company also forecasted a wide range with a midpoint above the consensus. Following the release, the price action in TSCO was bullish, rising by more than 4% to a new high. The move reveals ample support within an eager market, with the trading set to hit its potential to continue higher. The move to new highs broke the market out of a trading range worth approximately $13, which puts the base-case target in the $74.50 to $75 range. It could be reached this year. The longer-term outlook is also bullish. The company remains on track to expand its store count and improve comparable sales over time. The analyst consensus forecasts mid-to-high single-digit revenue growth and high-single-digit to low-double-digit earnings growth for the subsequent nine years. This puts TSCO at roughly 11.5x its earnings outlook and in deep value territory. Before you consider Tractor Supply, you'll want to hear this.

3 Short Squeeze Candidates With Big Catalysts on the Horizon,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/3-short-squeeze-candidates-with-big-catalysts-on-the-horizon/,"In 2021, a new presidential administration took shape while meme stocks and short squeezes sent markets into a frenzy. In 2025, another new presidential administration is taking shape, while meme stocks and short squeezes again send markets into a frenzy. While history doesn’t always repeat, we might see it rhyme as obscure small-cap stocks produce parabolic gains on a wave of retail volume. The names are different (and it’s Superman leading the box office this time over Spider-Man), but it might be time to dust off the short squeeze trading playbook and consider a few lottery tickets. Hunting short squeezes is risky since these stocks are often thinly traded and highly volatile. Before buying any of the three stocks discussed here today, make sure this strategy fits with your investment goals. Short squeeze candidates are often terrible-looking investments at face value—that’s why so many investors are shorting! You don’t short profitable winners like NVIDIA Corp. NASDAQ: NVDA; instead, you short movie chains struggling to remain solvent, like AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. NYSE: AMC, or unprofitable tech firms, like Opendoor Technologies Inc. NASDAQ: OPEN. The idea behind a short squeeze isn’t a good long-term investment, but a quick parabolic gain as shorts race to cover. That’s why traders don’t look at fundamentals, but factors like these: Most heavily-shorted stocks don’t produce a squeeze, which is why finding a catalyst is a crucial part of due diligence. Nostalgia has drawn the AMC and GameStop crowds, but there needs to be a genuine reason for a reversal when hunting squeezes (as Gabriel highlights here for Opendoor). Here are three more candidates with high short interest and upcoming catalysts to keep on your radar. Shorting stocks in the semiconductor space is a bold decision considering the AI gold rush, but Navitas Semiconductor Corp. NASDAQ: NVTS currently sports 32% short interest on its 134 million share float. Shorts control about $385 million of the stock’s $1.72 billion market cap, which makes sense considering the company only generated $83 million in sales over the last 12 months and continues to post negative EPS. The company's Q1 revenue dropped nearly 40% year over year (YOY), but it did meet analyst expectations. The Q2 report is scheduled for August 4, and while expectations are low, an upside surprise could be the catalyst needed to trigger a squeeze. Red Cat Holdings Inc. NASDAQ: RCAT has seen short interest balloon lately, with 20% of the float now short, a 38% increase over the previous month. A poor Q1 earnings report is likely the culprit, as the company missed EPS expectations by a significant margin—a loss of 27 cents per share reported versus a 10-cent loss expected. However, the company expects to achieve profitability by the end of the year, and its drone capabilities have already sparked interest from the U.S. government. Regulatory tailwinds are at Red Cat’s back, and its next earnings report is scheduled for August 14. QuantumScape Corp. NYSE: QS only has 14% short interest, but that hasn’t stopped it from pumping out a 123% gain over the last month as the short squeeze trend reignited. The EV battery maker’s stock jumped 30% on a single day in June after announcing its new Cobra Separator Process. Since this development, regulatory headwinds for EVs have been introduced, but those were likely priced in as the stock soared again in July. Shares are down 14% this week as the rally takes a breather, but they received a price target boost from Robert Baird, which increased from $6 to $11, now the highest figure on the Street.

"CrowdStrike Scores Big With Gartner, But Valuation Is Stretched",https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/crowdstrike-scores-big-with-gartner-but-valuation-is-stretched/,"Investors frequently hear that a company is different from its stock. That’s good to remember when processing a recent win for CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. NASDAQ: CRWD. The cybersecurity company was named a Leader in the 2025 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Endpoint Protection Platforms (EPP) for the 6th consecutive year. Endpoint protection refers to the cybersecurity solutions at the edge. These solutions protect individual devices, including laptops, mobile phones, servers, and IoT hardware, from threats like malware, ransomware, and zero-day attacks. With the expansion of cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) architecture, endpoint protection is critical to preventing breaches. Why CrowdStrike? The company’s cloud-native Falcon platform stands out for its ability to deliver lightweight, AI-powered protection directly to devices without the need for legacy antivirus software. The benefits to users include: In naming CrowdStrike the winner, Gartner praised the company for its vision, execution, and continued innovation, including its expanding use of AI and machine learning to automate threat detection and reduce response times. In its first-quarter 2026 earnings report, CrowdStrike delivered its first quarter in which revenue topped the $1 billion mark. The company’s own projections suggest that the trend will continue. Earnings per share (EPS) are also expected to be strong, but on a year-over-year (YOY) basis, this is where investors may have some concern. The company is in fine financial shape, but it’s priced for growth that may already be priced into the stock. The wildcard will be the revenue CrowdStrike expects as the goodwill offerings it issued last year turn into realized revenue as customers decide to keep the modules. However, investors won’t learn about that until the company reports earnings on August 27, at the end of a month that is historically one of the slowest for the markets. CRWD stock is down over 4.4% in the last 30 days. For investors who are looking for a better entry point, it’s a good start. CrowdStrike is up nearly 50% from hitting its 2025 low in March. Cybersecurity is a critical part of the AI trade, and CrowdStrike’s bullish earnings report in May solidified the company’s position in the sector. However, with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 839.13x, the stock still trades at a significant premium to other tech stocks in general, and specifically to cybersecurity stocks. For example, Palo Alto Networks Inc. NASDAQ: PANW, which also features a platformization strategy, has a forward P/E of around 113x. CrowdStrike is also trading slightly above its consensus price target of $461.17. That said, several analysts have raised their price target on the stock since the company’s earnings report in The long-term trend lines continue to support a move higher, but a healthy pause can make the stock more attractive. In the short term, there may be some more selling. The stock has dropped below its 50-day simple moving average (SMA), a bearish sign supported by its MACD signal. If CRWD moves below $450, the next level of support could be around $435 and below that, around $418. With the new price targets from several analysts, either of these targets could serve as solid entry points. CrowdStrike’s repeated Gartner recognition reaffirms its leadership in endpoint security. This segment is becoming increasingly vital in a cloud- and AI-first world. However, the stock’s valuation and technical outlook suggest that near-term caution is advisable. That doesn’t mean current shareholders should sell. But without a meaningful pullback, investors may want to wait for confirmation of post-August earnings momentum before adding or initiating positions.

Intel's Turnaround Gains Credibility With Strong Q2 Report,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/intels-turnaround-gains-credibility-with-strong-q2-report/,"The moments after an earnings release often tell a story, and for Intel Corporation NASDAQ: INTC on Thursday after the market closed, that story was one of volatile validation. Following the release of its second-quarter results, Intel’s stock price initially surged from its closing price near $22.60 to around $24.22 and then began violently moving between those two numbers. This dynamic action reflects the market's real-time digestion of a complex report, which contained significant short-term costs and clear long-term strategic benefits. This was a pivotal transition quarter, during which Intel absorbed its ambitious restructuring strategy's heavy, upfront costs. While the headline numbers were messy, the underlying results, and most importantly, the forward-looking guidance provided the validation investors were seeking, confirming that the company's turnaround strategy is firmly on track. At first glance, the second quarter's earnings results presented a mixed picture. However, a deeper look reveals a clear bullish narrative. The top-line result was a distinct positive, with Q2 revenue of $12.9 billion coming in flat year-over-year but beating the high end of Intel's guidance and Wall Street's expectations. This revenue strength was supported by a 4% year-over-year gain in the critical Data Center and AI Group (DCAI) segment, a key positive indicator of demand in a core growth market. While the Client Computing Group (CCG) saw a slight 3% dip, the growth in the higher-margin data center business was a welcome sign for investors. The headline non-GAAP loss of $0.10 per share requires important context. This was not the result of an operational failure but was a direct and expected consequence of planned, one-time charges essential to the company's long-term strategy. These included $1.9 billion in restructuring costs and $800 million in asset impairments, which should be viewed as an investment in future efficiency. However, the most important number in the entire report was the forward-looking guidance for Q3 non-GAAP gross margin, which is forecast to be approximately 36.0%. This represents a significant sequential improvement of more than 600 basis points from Q2's 29.7%. For investors, this is the first concrete financial indication that the deep and challenging cost-cutting measures are starting to positively impact profitability. Gross margin is a direct measure of manufacturing efficiency and pricing power, two areas of intense focus for Intel. This quarter’s guidance provides a credible path to a healthier financial model. Beyond the financial figures, the earnings report served as a scorecard for management's execution, demonstrating that the company is delivering on its strategic promises. For investors looking for tangible proof of a turnaround, Intel provided several key points: The second-quarter results, while complex, were a necessary step in the company's deep operational reset. The market's reaction reflects a new, more nuanced understanding of the company's trajectory. The report successfully removed significant execution risk from the investment thesis. The turnaround is no longer just a plan on a slide deck; it is a series of complex but now completed actions with a clear path to financial improvement. The bullish case for Intel is stronger today than it was before this report, as the company has provided a clear set of metrics for investors to track its continued progress on the path to recovery.

Quantum Gold Rush: The Catalysts Driving Quantum Stocks Higher,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/quantum-gold-rush-the-catalysts-driving-quantum-stocks-higher/,"Stocks across the quantum computing sector have posted strong gains since the start of a summer-long rally, driven by a powerful series of technical and commercial achievements. This progress suggests the quantum computing industry is reaching an inflection point, moving from the research lab toward a commercial reality. With seemingly assured commercial success, market attention is now turning to quantum computing's potential to transform the entire technology sector fundamentally. This transformation's promise is underpinning the sector's thesis for long-term value creation. Quantum machines promise to solve unsolvable problems in finance, medicine, and logistics. Investors watching quantum sector tickers might have noticed that the conversation has shifted from abstract promise to tangible progress. Recent milestones from three key competitors provide the clearest picture yet of the different paths being built, each promising to lead us to a quantum future. D-Wave Quantum’s NYSE: QBTS stock momentum is tied directly to its strategy of delivering business value today. A recent study commissioned by the company found that 81% of business leaders believe they have hit the limits of classical computing for optimization, highlighting the immediate demand D-Wave aims to fill. The company’s core technology, quantum annealing, is built to meet this need. It functions like a specialized machine designed to find the optimal solution from many possibilities, making it ideal for streamlining logistics or balancing financial portfolios. This practical strategy is delivering precise results. In the first quarter of 2025, D-Wave’s revenue grew 509% year-over-year, boosted by the first sale of its flagship Advantage2 system. Real-world projects with customers like Ford Otosan and Total Transport Logistics show its technology is already solving business challenges. For investors, this clear path to revenue builds confidence in the company's business model and supports its valuation as a first-mover. Rigetti Computing’s NASDAQ: RGTI 30% single-day stock surge on July 16 was a direct reaction to a major technical breakthrough. The company announced that it achieved 99.5% two-qubit gate fidelity, a key measure of accuracy that effectively halved the error rate in its quantum computer. This achievement is critical because Rigetti is pursuing the gate-based model. This is the ambitious path toward a universal quantum computer. A universal quantum computer would be a machine that, like a modern CPU, could one day run any kind of quantum algorithm. Managing and reducing errors is the main obstacle to building such a powerful machine. By demonstrating a significant leap in accuracy on its scalable multi-chip system, Rigetti has proven that its engineering strategy is working. For investors, the bet on Rigetti is less about today's revenue and more about its potential to build the industry's most powerful machines. This winner-take-all potential fuels the stock's growth, which is driven by technical progress. Each milestone moves it closer to the ultimate prize. Quantum Computing Inc.'s NASDAQ: QUBT recent momentum was solidified by its first major U.S. commercial contract: a purchase order from a top-five bank to build a quantum cybersecurity testbed. The deal spotlights the disruptive potential of the company’s core technology, integrated photonics. Unlike competitors that require massive, expensive cryogenic systems to cool their machines, QUBT’s hardware uses light particles and operates at room temperature. This fundamentally changes the hardware game. It could make quantum systems dramatically cheaper, smaller, and easier to deploy. The strategy is to outmaneuver competitors with more practical technology. The bank contract validates this approach in the ultra-high-value quantum cybersecurity market. Furthermore, QUBT's in-house photonic chip foundry gives it critical control over its supply chain. For investors, QUBT represents a bet on a disruptive technology that could leapfrog the competition and speed up mainstream adoption. These companies have multi-billion-dollar market capitalizations, yet their current revenues are minimal. This results in extremely high price-to-sales ratios (P/S) that do not fit traditional analysis. The current market valuations for the quantum sector are not and can not be based on last quarter’s profits; they are forward-looking bets on a foundational technology, much like investing in internet stocks in the late 1990s. The investment thesis is based on capturing a piece of a future market worth trillions. In this context, the recent technical and commercial milestones provide the tangible evidence investors need to justify such forward-looking confidence. The quantum sector's recent rally is more than market noise; it responds to real-world execution. Each company offers a distinct and now-validated approach: D-Wave with near-term commercial sales, Rigetti with long-term technological power, and Quantum Computing Inc. with disruptive, practical hardware. The race is heating up, and the focus has firmly shifted from promise to proof for investors. Before you consider D-Wave Quantum, you'll want to hear this.

From Benjamin Franklin to Pony Express to anthrax: How the US Postal Service shaped a nation,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/from-benjamin-franklin-to-pony-express-to-anthrax-how-the-us-postal-service-shaped-a-nation-2025-07-25/,"The one government agency that still reaches nearly every American daily — undeterred by rain, sleet, snow or even gloom of night — turns 250 on Saturday. Established in 1775, when the Second Continental Congress appointed Benjamin Franklin as postmaster general, the postal service predates the United States itself. It was launched nearly a year before the colonies declared their break from British rule. “The country may not even have come into existence but for the Postal Service,” said Stephen Allen Kochersperger, the postal service historian and a former local postmaster. Now grappling with concerns over its financial viability, the independent agency has had a long and colorful history. It has grown from serving the 13 colonies to delivering more mail than any other postal system in the world, reaching nearly 169 million addresses and employing more than 635,000 people. When the Continental Congress met in 1775, it had two main priorities: appoint a commander to lead the war against Britain and appoint a postmaster to oversee communication among the colonies. Franklin was chosen because he had served in the British postal service for North America. He'd been dismissed in 1774, in part for his radical views. The early American postal service linked colonial leaders and the Continental Army. It also helped unify the diverse, fragmented colonies by spreading ideas of liberty and independence through letters, newspapers and pamphlets. “People were reading, getting ideas of what it would be like to be an independent country,” Kochersperger said. When the U.S. Constitution was ratified, Congress was granted power to establish post offices and mail routes — many along existing Native American trails. These post roads, first used by mail carriers on horseback, were upgraded for stagecoaches. Some evolved into highways still used today. Historians have said this aided settler expansion into Native lands and was intertwined with the displacement of tribes. As western migration accelerated, mail was sent by ship from New York to Central America and on to California. Delivery typically took two to three months. Before the advent of stamps, postage was generally collected in cash from the recipient. “By the mid 19th century, the problem is developing that the post office is carrying a lot of letters for which it’s never actually getting paid,” said Daniel Piazza, chief curator of philately at the Smithsonian National Postal Museum. With no home delivery, recipients either didn’t want the letters or were unaware of them. Postmasters paid to publish in newspapers lists of people with mail piling up. In 1847, the first U.S. postage stamps were issued. Making postage prepaid saved the post office the trouble of chasing down its money. “That’s a business model that’s pioneered in 1847 that is still the basic business model of the postal service today,” Piazza said. While the Pony Express is legendary, it only lasted about 18 months. Operated by private carriers from April 3, 1860, to Oct. 26, 1861, a relay system of riders on horseback carried mail, often from San Francisco or Sacramento, California, to St. Joseph, Missouri, the furthest westward railroad stop. The 1,800-mile (2,900-kilometer) journey took 10 days. As a West Coast stock market emerged, most mail was financial, Piazza said. Businesses needed to send stock quotes and commodity prices across the country. “And so they’re willing to pay exorbitant amounts of money to do that,” Piazza said. “The Pony Express was very, very expensive.” While U.S. postage to send a letter was 10 cents in 1860, it initially cost an additional $5 to send mail by Pony Express — close to $200 today. Piazza said the service was scuttled by the Civil War and made obsolete with the advent of the telegraph. Later, the transcontinental railroad reduced mail delivery from months to days. After early experimentation, free mail delivery to homes began in earnest in the nation’s largest cities in 1863. During the Civil War, the only communication from a father, brother, husband or son usually came through letter-writing. The postal service let soldiers send mail for free and vote by mail — an early forerunner of mail-in ballots. Women lined up daily at post offices, awaiting word. Sometimes they got their own letters back, with a note saying their loved one had been killed. “And that was a terrible scene at the post office that played out almost every day,” Kochersperger said. Postal officials in Cleveland decided to take mail to people's homes out of compassion, he said. The idea spread quickly. City home delivery proved popular, but nearly two-thirds of Americans still lived in rural areas by the end of the 19th century. Demand was so great that rural free delivery, or RFD, began expanding rapidly around 1900. While authorized air mail flights began in 1911, the nation's first regularly scheduled air mail service began on May 15, 1918. The initial routes were between Washington, D.C., Philadelphia and New York, using Army pilots and planes. The post office soon took over air mail, running operations for nine years until turning to fledgling private airline companies, some of which remain major airlines. In the early days, flights were so dangerous that some pilots dubbed themselves the Suicide Club. Thirty-two pilots were killed, including four whose planes caught fire in flight, according to the National Postal Museum. There were no commercial aviation systems, navigational tools or radios, and pilots relied on landmarks to find their way. “These pilots were flying in open cockpits and all kinds of weather. It was very risky,” Kochersperger said. Part of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal plan to address the Great Depression was to put people to work on federal construction projects. That included roughly 2,000 new post offices. A portion of each building's budget was reserved for artwork, such as murals. Hundreds of post offices still house original art from the era. During World War II, the 6888th Central Postal Battalion, or the Six Triple Eight, an all-Black and all-female unit of the Women's Army Corps, went overseas to tackle a massive backlog of undelivered mail for troops in Europe, many of whom had been reassigned. The unit's motto was, “No mail, low morale.” It cleared the backlog in three months. After World War II, the economy boomed — and so did the population. The post office needed a faster way to sort massive amounts of mail. It could no longer do so by hand. On July 1, 1963, each post office was given a five-digit ZIP code. “Previously, clerks had to memorize thousands of points of address information so they could sort the mail,” Kochersperger said. “With the ZIP code, you didn’t have to memorize anything.” The public was skeptical at first, balking at more numbers. So, the post office came up with a friendly cartoon character named Mr. ZIP, who helped convince people their mail would arrive faster. It took some getting used to, but it worked. “Today, can you imagine life without a ZIP code?” Kochersperger asked. In 1970, a strike was called over low wages by leaders of the National Association of Letter Carriers union in New York and quickly broadened in scope. After about 200,000 workers joined the first U.S. postal strike, President Richard Nixon called up the National Guard to help sort mail. But it was a “disaster” after two days, Kochersperger said. The strike led to the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970, which authorized collective bargaining rights for postal workers. It also transformed the taxpayer-supported Post Office Department into the United States Postal Service, a financially self-sustaining and independent agency within the executive branch. The postmaster general would work for a board of governors instead of reporting to the president. The U.S. Postal Service would set its own rates, control its finances and decide post office locations. Weeks after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, four threatening letters contaminated with anthrax were sent through the mail, including to two U.S. senators. Two workers at a mail distribution center in Washington, D.C., died after breathing in the spores. Three other people were killed, and more than a dozen were sickened. Following a nine-year investigation, authorities concluded the person who mailed the anthrax had taken his own life in 2008 and the case was closed, but new precautions were added to protect workers. “It changed the whole way that we sorted mail at that time,” Kochersperger said. Years later, postal workers would be designated essential workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and don protective gear again. The advent of the internet and private companies like Amazon has taken a bite out of mail volume, threatening the postal service's financial viability. A 10-year modernization effort was launched to keep up with the times. Reaction has been mixed, but David Steiner, the agency's newly appointed postmaster general, says some improvements have been made. Steiner, a former FedEx board member, wants to help keep the service self-sustaining. He has said he opposes privatization, an idea raised by President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk, and believes the agency has a bright future as an independent entity. “There is much to build upon in the years ahead,” he said. ___ Haigh reported from Hartford, Conn.
