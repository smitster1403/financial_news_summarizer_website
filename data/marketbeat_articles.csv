"PepsiCo agrees to meet with Al Sharpton over DEI cuts, potential boycott",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/pepsico-agrees-to-meet-with-al-sharpton-over-dei-cuts-potential-boycott-2025-04-14/,"Leaders at PepsiCo have agreed to meet this week with civil rights advocates from the National Action Network to discuss the company's recent decision to roll back some of its diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, the Reverend Al Sharpton said on Monday. In an April 4 letter to PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta, Sharpton threatened to lead a boycott against the company. PepsiCo — one of the largest food and beverage companies in North America whose brands include Gatorade, Lay’s potato chips, Doritos, Mountain Dew as well as Pepsi — told employees in February that the company will no longer set goals for minority representation in its managerial roles or supplier base. Sharpton said he will be meeting with Laguarta and he intends to press him on the specifics of the company's decision and what commitments it still has to ensuring equal opportunity in employment and contracts. A spokesperson for PepsiCo did not immediately respond to a request for comment. PepsiCo is one of several companies, including Walmart and Target, that have eliminated policies and programs aimed at increasing diversity among its employees and reducing discrimination against members of minority groups, women and LGBTQ+ people since President Donald Trump returned to the White House earlier this year. Trump ended DEI programswithin the federal government and has warned schools to do the same or risk losing federal money. In January, Sharpton led a “buy-cott” at Costco, encouraging Americans to vote with their dollars and shop at the retail giant for its commitment to DEI policies, even as many of its competitors phased them out. “That is the only viable tool that I see at this time, which is why we’ve rewarded those that stood with us,"" Sharpton told The Associated Press.

Denver Nuggets boss Josh Kroenke says firings of coach and GM were months in the making,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/denver-nuggets-boss-josh-kroenke-says-firings-of-coach-and-gm-were-months-in-the-making-2025-04-14/,"DENVER (AP) — Denver Nuggets boss Josh Kroenke said Monday that he twice balked at firing the winningest coach in franchise history and the general manager who connected the final pieces of the team's only championship puzzle before finally canning them last week with just three games left in the season. Kroenke held off in November to give the team time to jell and an eight-game winning streak heading into the All-Star break tempered his desire to part ways in February with coach Michael Malone and GM Calvin Booth. Kroenke finally fired both men last week in a move that stunned the league because the Nuggets had already secured a seventh consecutive playoff berth and were less than two years removed from the city's first NBA championship parade. “So, what would be crazier, me doing what I did last week or doing it on an eight-game winning streak?” Kroenke asked. Only one of those eight wins leading into the All-Star break came against a team that would make the playoffs, the Orlando Magic, the No. 7 seed in the East. “I think that those eight games masked a trend that was going on behind closed doors that ultimately started to really affect the end of our season,” Kroenke said. Kroenke said he also seriously considered a change around Thanksgiving with the Nuggets off to a so-so start and “I was really feeling like things weren't headed in the right direction.” But he said he held off then to give the team time to settle in. Despite leading Denver to its first title in 47 years, Malone and Booth long clashed over roster philosophies, a discord that led to a toxicity in the organization that began to affect the team’s fortunes and which led Kroenke to fire them both. The Nuggets won all three games under interim coach David Adelman to secure a third consecutive 50-win season and the fourth seed in the West, where they'll open at home Saturday against the fifth-seeded Los Angeles Clippers. Kroenke said he'll commence a search for both positions after the season but he demurred when asked if he wanted to have a GM in place before hiring a head coach: “My thoughts aren't there because this season's not over."" Kroenke also announced he'd promoted Ben Tenzer to interim GM for the playoff run. Kroenke began his nearly 30-minute news conference, his first since the firings, by praising Malone and Booth: “I want to start off by initially just staying thank you to both Calvin and Coach Malone ... And to be frank, neither one of them deserved it, so for that I apologize.” Kroenke said he ultimately made the decision to move on from both men “with the hope of kind of rejuvenating the energy of the group and re-establishing some positive thoughts before the playoffs. I think we did that over the last three games ... still have a long way to go."" Nikola Jokic is the gemstone of the Nuggets' roster and the changes at the helm were driven in part by the desire to capitalize on whatever prime playing years the three-time MVP has remaining. “You have a responsibility when you have a player like that, especially, obviously, in his prime,” Kroenke said. “But I feel an even greater responsibility to the person. ... I'd be the dumbest guy in basketball if I wasn't asking him for his opinion on certain things. But it's my responsibility to make those decisions for the best of the organization and I think Jokic understands and respects that.” Kroenke debunked the notion that he was unwilling to trade anyone not named Jokic, including fellow Missouri alum Michael Porter Jr., following reports that he nixed a deal for the long-range sharp-shooter at the trade deadline. “If it wasn't such a serious accusation, I would probably laugh a little harder,” Kroenke said. “I'd say any kind of report that we're not open to trading everybody possible to improve the team is completely false.” He added: “I'm certainly not going to be green-lighting any trades around here when I don't see complete organization cohesion and we're not maximizing the group we got.” Kroenke noted that he couldn't always be on hand at Ball Arena to police the winning culture that had started to ebb with Malone and Booth at odds. “I have a wide array of responsibilities across our businesses at this point,” Kroenke said of the family's sports empire, which includes the Los Angeles Rams, the Colorado Avalanche and English soccer club Arsenal. “I mean, last Tuesday was the craziest Tuesday that I could have ever imagined. I had the worst morning that I've had in over 10 years with the Nuggets followed by the most amazing afternoon I could have ever asked for with the Arsenal Football Club,"" Kroenke said. ""We beat Real Madrid 3-0 in the quarterfinals of the Champions League ... On a human level, that was a rough Tuesday for me. It was all over the place.” ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/nba Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

"Getting the IRS on the phone is more difficult this tax filing season, experts say",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/getting-the-irs-on-the-phone-is-more-difficult-this-tax-filing-season-experts-say-2025-04-14/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Taxpayers calling the IRS for help processing their taxes this filing season may find it harder than normal to get someone on the phone, experts say, a problem that is only expected to get worse next year with staffing cuts that could slash the workforce considerably. For this year, data of tax return processing times shows numbers largely in line with those from last year. IRS employees involved in the 2025 tax season were not allowed to accept a buyout offer from the Trump administration until after the taxpayer filing deadline of April 15, though thousands of probationary workers were laid off earlier this year. Legal experts in tax compliance say the long wait times are going to increase as more buyouts and layoffs take effect. Eric Santos, the executive director of the Georgia Tax Clinic, which provides free tax law services to low-income taxpayers, says wait times for the IRS’ phone line are markedly longer than usual and IRS staff are overwhelmed with the increase in work. The IRS staff ""basically tell us they don’t have time to look at certain cases,” Santos said. “The work is getting spread across fewer and fewer people.” The reduction in workers — which may end up being nearly half the entire IRS workforce — is part of the Trump administration’s efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce through billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency by closing agencies, laying off nearly all probationary employees who have not yet gained civil service protection and offering buyouts to almost all federal employees through a “deferred resignation program.” Earlier this month, the IRS began layoffs that could end up cutting as many as 20,000 staffers — up to 25% of the total workforce. The roughly 7,000 probationary IRS workers who were laid off beginning in February were recently ordered to be reinstated by a federal judge, though it's unclear whether those workers have been called back into work. Comparing figures through the first week of April from 2024 and 2025, 101.4 million returns were processed this year compared to 101.8 million tax returns last year. Refunds are up, with 67.7 million issued this year compared with 66.7 million in 2024. But Santos and others worry that the 2026 filing season could be negatively impacted by the loss of thousands of additional tax collection workers who are expected to exit the agency through planned layoffs and buyouts. “I don’t see how they’re going to keep up with tax filing season next year,” Santos said. “I think its a fair question to ask now.” A Treasury spokesperson who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity said in a statement that IRS staffing reductions were part of other improvements the agency is taking to be more efficient and improve service. Sakinah Tillman, director of the University of the District of Columbia Tax Clinic, has not seen a delay in processing refunds this year but has seen delays in reaching the IRS by phone. She worries that the phone delays could hurt clients going through collections who are trying to settle their debts. “What happens when clients try to become compliant?"" she asked. ""Or when people who are willing and able to pay but they just can’t get someone on the phone? Former IRS Commissioner John Koskinen told the AP that even in a normal year the IRS' responsiveness slows the further into tax season it gets. “Next year, if they cut 10,000 or 20,000 employees, they're headed back to really bad taxpayer service on the phone,” he said. ""And the taxpayer priority line will become an oxymoron.” Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

Confusion reigns after Trump exempts electronics from new tariff regime. Here's what we know,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/confusion-reigns-after-trump-exempts-electronics-from-new-tariff-regime-heres-what-we-know-2025-04-14/,"Confusion over President Donald Trump’s tariffs remains following a weekend of questions around trade in consumer electronics. On Friday the Trump administration paused its new taxes on electronics imported into the U.S. — signaling some relief from trade wars that have particularly escalated with China, a major exporter of technology from smartphones to laptops. But these goods remain subject to other levies. And officials have also indicated that additional, sector-specific tariffs targeting electronics are on the way — all of which economists warn will raise costs and lead to higher prices for consumers. Here's what we know. Late Friday, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection said that electronics, including smartphones and laptops, would be excluded from broader, so-called “reciprocal” tariffs — meaning these goods wouldn't be subject to most tariffs levied on China to date or the 10% baseline levies imposed on other countries. But U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick later said that this was only a temporary reprieve — telling ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday that electronics will be included under future sector-specific tariffs on semiconductor products, set to arrive in ""probably a month or two.” And not all of the levies that the U.S. has imposed on countries like China fall under the White House's “reciprocal” categorization. Hours after Lutnick's comments, Trump declared on social media that there was no “exception” at all, adding to confusion. Trump instead argued that these goods are “just moving to a different” bucket. He also said that China will still face a 20% levy on electronics imports as part of his administration’s prior move related to fentanyl trafficking. On Sunday, China’s commerce ministry welcomed a partial reprieve on consumer electronics — but continued to call for the U.S. to completely cancel the rest of its tariffs. Chinese President Xi Jinping reiterated that on Monday, writing in an editorial jointly published in Vietnamese and Chinese official media that ""there are no winners in a trade war.” He added that both China and the U.S. “should resolutely safeguard the multilateral trading system, stable global industrial and supply chains, and open and cooperative international environment.” Tit-for-tat tariffs between the U.S. and China have escalated to new heights over recent months. Since taking office in January, Trump has imposed a series of levies that now amount to 145% taxes on a range of imports from the country. In response, China has hit back with its own measures, including tariffs on U.S. goods that currently total 125%. Its Commerce Ministry has also said it will impose more export controls on rare earths, used in high-tech products such as computer chips and electric vehicle batteries. Tariffs are taxes on goods imported from other countries. And because so many of the electronics we buy rely on a global supply chain, economists have warned that tariffs impacting consumer technology could mean higher prices for your next smartphone, computer or other gadgets. Reducing the size of those tariffs, even temporarily, could delay or lessen that impact. But it's unlikely that price hikes will be totally avoided. Electronics will still be taxed by previous (non-""reciprocal”) tariffs — and potentially under additional, sector-specific levies down the road. It would also be incredibly difficult for companies to change their supply chains. The Trump administration argues that tariffs will entice big names like Apple, for example, to make iPhones in the U.S. for the first time. But Apple has spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China — and it would take years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S. Wendong Zhang, an assistant professor of applied economics and policy at Cornell University, says the tariffs' impact on consumer tech reflects how difficult a “full decoupling between U.S. and China” is. Products like laptops, smartphones and the components needed to make them accounted for nearly $174 billion in U.S. imports from China last year. Trump signaled on Monday that he had spoken to Apple CEO Tim Cook before exempting electronics from some of his China tariffs — telling reporters that he had “helped” Cook with the partial reprieve, while separately saying he plans to provide temporary exemptions for auto makers that may also need “a little bit of time.” Apple did not immediately respond to The Associated Press' request for statement. Tariffs have plunged financial markets worldwide into turmoil — particularly battering stocks following of Trump's sweeping announcement on April 2. That cooled after news of this partial electronics exemption, as well as last week's pause of steeper tariffs outside of China. On Monday, the S&P 500 climbed 0.8%, though trading was still shaky, and it briefly gave back all of its big early gain of 1.8%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 312 points, or 0.8%, and the Nasdaq composite added 0.6%. Still, the relief could be fleeting. While the partial electronics reprieve indicates that Trump is watching markets, Zhang notes, it and other looming actions also show that the administration’s “tariff strategy is a lot more about the leverage and signaling ... as opposed to coherent long term trade framework.” Overall, uncertainty remains high — making it hard for many companies trying to solidify long-term plans when conditions seem to change daily. “Businesses thrive on stability because they plan around rules of engagement ... Ergo, markets perform better when businesses are confident that the rules are really the rules,” Dipanjan Chatterjee, vice president and principal analyst at Forrester, wrote in a Monday note. Still, he added, businesses will need to avoid knee-jerk reactions while evaluating risk. “When Friday’s policies are thrown out with Sunday’s brunch leftovers, companies will resort to one primary strategy: do as little as possible and thereby do no harm.” _______ AP Writers Josh Boak in Washington, Mae Anderson in Nashville, Tennessee and Matt O'Brien in Providence, Rhode Island, contributed to this report.

Keystone Pipeline restarted after oil spill in rural North Dakota,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/company-plans-to-restart-keystone-pipeline-after-oil-spill-in-rural-north-dakota-2025-04-14/,"BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — The operator of the Keystone oil pipeline restarted the system Monday after a spill onto farmland in North Dakota last week shut down the line. South Bow said it was watching inclement weather conditions before beginning “a carefully controlled restart” that will include 24/7 monitoring, reduced operating pressures, cleanup of the site and compliance with federal regulators' requirements. The federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration said South Bow restarted the pipeline at a reduced pressure. The failed section was dug out and replaced and will be taken to a metallurgical lab in Houston for testing, while the repaired pipeline will be tested at different pressures to ensure its integrity, PHMSA said. The agency's investigation is ongoing. It is unclear what caused the spill. The company said it has finished all repairs, inspections and testing at the spill site. PHMSA said it signed off on the company's restart plan. South Bow also said it will put certain pressure restrictions on the pipeline's Canadian sections, and has shared those details with Canadian regulators. The company's update did not mention a cause of the spill, though the company said it would share investigation findings when available. An employee heard a “mechanical bang"" and shut down the pipeline within two minutes, a state spill response official previously said. The spill is estimated at 3,500 barrels, or 147,000 gallons. Vacuum trucks had recovered 1,170 barrels of crude oil, or 49,140 gallons, as of early Friday, according to PHMSA. The spill occurred in a field north of Fort Ransom, North Dakota, a tiny town in a forested area known for scenic views and outdoor recreation. The 2,689-mile (4,327 kilometers) Keystone Pipeline carries crude oil from Alberta, Canada, to refineries in Illinois, Oklahoma and Texas. The pipeline was shut down from Alberta to points in Illinois and a liquid tank terminal Oklahoma, though the line remained open between Oklahoma and Texas' Gulf Coast, according to a map from South Bow. Lower oil prices due to tariff issues helped mute challenges from the pipeline shutdown on gas prices, though diesel prices could still inch up, said Ramanan Krishnamoorti, vice president for energy and innovation at the University of Houston. Gas prices have fallen in almost every state in the last week due to the oil price drop resulting from the tariff and trade war concerns, said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis for GasBuddy, which tracks gas prices. “I wouldn't have expected this to really have much of an impact anyway, but with oil prices actively having plummeted over the last week, yes, I would say that the decline was more than offset,” he said.

Why NVIDIA Stock Could Soar Despite Wall Street Downgrades,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/why-nvidia-stock-could-soar-despite-wall-street-downgrades/,"NVIDIA NASDAQ: NVDA analysts started reducing their ratings and price targets in late March, which presents a headwind for the stock price action. MarketBeat tracks five consecutive negative revisions beginning March 20, including three price target reductions and two downgrades. The downgrades are from Buy or Strong Buy to Hold, and the net result could be a cap on the market. Regardless of where the consensus target forecasts the stock price, a trend in negative revisions saps investor appetite. This could lead to an even deeper market correction than NVIDIA has already seen. The risk now is that negative revisions will become the trend. However, not all analysts are cutting their targets. The five-revision trend that began in late March ended in mid-April when Bank of America reiterated its rating and target. Analysts at Bank of America peg this stock at Moderate Buy, aligning with the broad consensus, and see it advancing to $200 or nearly 80% upside relative to the April 14th price action. They cite the tariff pause as a catalyst for the business. While the pause does not end the risk of tariffs, it is seen as a catalyst for policy action on Capitol Hill to support and accelerate the onshoring of U.S. semiconductor manufacturing. NVIDIA plans to manufacture half a trillion dollars in AI infrastructure domestically within four years. The bold claim is supported by ongoing investment in Arizona and Texas facilities, including Taiwan Semiconductor NYSE: TSM and Foxconn, which are intended to ramp up production for NVIDIA and other prominent semiconductor firms. The goal for NVIDIA is for 100% domestic production of its most advanced chips, including Blackwell and Rubin line-ups, front and back end, packaging, and testing. As it is, the company expects to begin ramping up domestic production at two Texas facilities within the next 12 to 15 months. It has already commissioned more than 1 million square feet of manufacturing space.  As much risk as there is for NVIDIA analysts to cap gains in 2025, the downside is limited because of the stock’s low valuation and outlook for business growth. NVIDIA revenue growth is expected to continue slowing due to the law of large numbers and maturing AI markets, but it will sustain a moderate to low double-digit pace through the end of the next decade. This forecast puts the stock under 10x its earnings by the middle of the next decade, presenting a generational buying opportunity. The stock price could easily double in this scenario, and the odds are high that it will rise significantly more because the forecasts are likely too low. Clouds and economic headwinds in early 2025 impacted the outlook, but when they ease, global business, including AI infrastructure build, can regain momentum. The catalyst could come with the Q2 earnings report due at the end of May, when the company issues another solid report and provides positive guidance. Because of the technical setup and analyst forecasts, NVIDIA could set new highs before its Q2 earnings report is released. Although some analysts have trimmed targets and the consensus has fallen from a peak, it forecasts a 50% upside for this stock, sufficient to exceed the current all-time high by 1500 basis points and could be reached quickly. Once this market clearly indicates it is moving higher, investor capital will start to flood into it and drive the stock price to the $190 range or higher.

"Here's a look at recent aircraft tragedies, mishaps and close calls",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/heres-a-look-at-recent-aircraft-tragedies-mishaps-and-close-calls-2025-04-14/,"The crash of a small plane in New York over the weekend killed all six on board — a physician couple and their accomplished children and partners — during a family trip to the Catskills. It's the latest in a series of aviation disasters at a time of heightened scrutiny of aircraft collisions and near-misses. The most deadly was the collision of a passenger jet and a military helicopter over the Potomac River that that killed 67 people in January. In February, one airliner clipped another while taxiing at the Seattle airport. In March, an American Airlines plane caught fire after landing in Denver, sending 12 people to the hospital. Federal officials have tried to reassure travelers that flying is the safest mode of transportation, and statistics support that. But the cascade of headlines about things going wrong is drawing increasing attention amid declining confidence in air travel and cuts at the Federal Aviation Administration, part of President Donald Trump's efforts to downsize the federal government. Here is a look at some of the recent aircraft tragedies and mishaps: — The twin-engine Mitsubishi MU-2B went down shortly after noon Saturday in a muddy field in Copake, New York, near the Massachusetts line, shortly after the pilot radioed air traffic control at Columbia County Airport to say he had missed the initial approach and requested a new landing plan. — Six people were killed this month when a sightseeing helicopter broke apart and crashed into the Hudson River. The helicopter lifted off from a New York City heliport, flying north along the Manhattan skyline and then south toward the Statue of Liberty before hitting the water. The pilot was killed along with a family from Spain that was celebrating the ninth birthday of one of their children. — Three people were killed and one was injured when a small plane crashed Friday morning near an interstate highway and pushed a car onto railroad tracks in Boca Raton, Florida. — Two small planes collided near an Arizona airport in mid-February. One managed to land uneventfully, but the other hit the ground near a runway and caught fire, killing two people at Marana Regional Airport near Tucson. — A small commuter plane crashed in western Alaska in early February, killing all 10 people on board. The crash was one of the deadliest in the state in 25 years. Radar data indicated that the plane rapidly lost elevation after an air traffic controller told it to slow down in icy weather so the runway at their destination could be de-iced. — A medical transport plane plummeted into a Philadelphia neighborhood after taking off in January, killing all six people on board and one person on the ground. The National Transportation Safety Board said its cockpit voice recorder likely hadn't been functioning for years. The crew made no distress calls to air traffic control. — The collision between an American Airlines passenger jet and an Army helicopter above the nation's capital killed everyone aboard both aircraft in late January. It was the deadliest plane crash in the U.S. since Nov. 12, 2001, when a jet slammed into a New York City neighborhood just after takeoff, killing all 260 people on board and five on the ground. — A jetliner operated by Jeju Air skidded off a runway, slammed into a concrete fence and burst into flames in December after its landing gear apparently failed to deploy, killing all but two of the 181 people aboard in one of South Korea's worst aviation disasters. — The American Airlines plane that caught fire at Denver International Airport in March had been diverted there because the crew reported engine vibrations. While taxiing to the gate, an engine caught fire, prompting slides to be deployed so that passengers could evacuate quickly. The people taken to hospitals had minor injuries. — A single-engine plane carrying five people crashed and burst into flames in the parking lot of a retirement community near a small airport outside Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in March. Everyone on board survived. Three people were taken to a burn center. — A Delta Air Lines jet flipped over while landing at Toronto’s Pearson Airport in February. All 80 people on board survived, but some people received minor injuries. Witnesses and video from the scene showed the plane landing so hard that its right wing was sheared off. Investigators were examining the weather conditions and the possibility of human error. — In April, on the same day as the fatal New York helicopter crash, a wing tip of an American Airlines plane struck another plane from the same airline on a taxiway of the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. There were no reported injuries.

The plane landed at Newark Liberty International Airport. There were no reported injuries. — Pilots on a Southwest Airlines flight about to land at Chicago’s Midway Airport were forced to climb back into the sky to avoid another aircraft crossing the runway in February. Video showed the plane approaching the runway before it abruptly pulled up as a business jet taxied onto the runway without authorization, federal officials said. — In February, a Japan Airlines plane was taxiing on the tarmac of Seattle-Tacoma International Airport when it apparently clipped the tail of a parked Delta plane. There were no injuries reported. — In January, passengers panicked when a man aboard a JetBlue plane that was taxiing for takeoff from Boston's Logan International Airport opened an exit door over a wing, trigging an emergency slide to inflate.

How to Maximize Your Property Investment Profits as the 2025 Rental Season Begins,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/how-to-maximize-your-property-investment-profits-as-the-2025-rental-season-begins-2025-04-14/,"When considering how to evaluate an investment to maximize profits, your chief concern should be limiting vacancies and filling the ones that do occur as quickly as possible. An empty investment property is not an investment property at all: It's a money pit. You must tailor your advertising efforts to consider who your ideal renter is. Renters in 2025 tend to search for listings online, whether through a listing site or social media platforms. Renters know what to look for in an investment property; you just have to show them those desirable traits within your own property on the platforms they will encounter your listing on. Related: How to Avoid Long-Term Rental Vacancies and Safeguard Revenue Online listings are extremely important in this digital age to bring in potential tenants and fill vacancies. As a landlord, vacant properties are detrimental to your ability to turn profit. Learning how to write an effective and engaging listing will help bring in as many interested renters as possible. Here are the three main components of a listing and some tips on how to master each one: Headline: The headline is the part of the listing that a potential renter sees first. They will judge whether they want to inquire further based on the heading you chose, so make sure it's a good one! The best headings are brief yet informative. The aspects of a property that renters are interested in most are the price, square footage, neighborhood and whatever features or amenities you think they'd be most interested in knowing about. Pictures: Besides your headline, the pictures in your listing will be the main attention-grabber in your listing. You need to ensure each photograph in your listing is high-quality, using a decent camera, tripod and uploaded on a high-quality file. Taking pictures during daylight hours is recommended, since natural light is most flattering. Artificial light can occasionally make a space look dingy or run-down. Sometimes, attaching a floor plan to your listing can help renters visualize where each room fits in the overall layout of the property. Description: When an interested renter makes it to your description, they've already looked at the heading and presumably skimmed through the pictures. The description is your chance to fill in any property details that are relevant and interesting to them, while still trying to persuade them that this could be their next investment. It can be easier for renters to digest description information if you put the following information in a bulleted list. Consider inserting information about amenities, dimensions, measurements and important lease terms. It's very important to remember to include your phone and email so anyone interested in the property has a way to reach you. Related: 7 Tips for Writing Engaging Listings for Your Rental Property Once you have your quality listing, you'll have to post it to a listing site so potential tenants can see it. Commercial listing sites like CoStar, LoopNet and Crexi can help you get your listing to thousands of eyes. If you'd like to attract a younger audience or simply expand the reach of your advertising efforts, consider using social media apps like Instagram, Facebook and TikTok. Each of these apps has a different audience — for example, Instagram and Facebook boast more millennial users than TikTok, which is more popular with Gen Z. Carefully consider what type of tenant you think would be interested in your property and then curate your social media strategy accordingly. It can be advantageous to hire a social media strategist or intern who is familiar with the trends for these sites. Going viral is not easy. If you're serious about launching a social media strategy, talk to other professionals or real estate investors who have forayed into this territory for advice. Finally, ensure that you're following all terms and conditions associated with advertising your business on social media. Each app has different rules and regulations, so to avoid being banned from the platform, read through each one's guidelines for advertising. Related: How to Enhance Your Rental Property Listings and Get More Units Filled This Year Innago, Appfolio and other property management platforms give you the opportunity to spend more time on your business, not in your business. Day-to-day tasks can quickly and easily take over your time, leaving less space in your schedule for business growth. Let those tedious tasks be automated with property management software. Some tasks that can be aided by property management software are tenant screening practices, security deposit filing and tracking, as well as rent payment reminders. Depending on what your specific business needs are, you can find the software that works best for you. Each company offers different things, so be sure to do your research and utilize companies that offer free trials to ensure that the platform is the one you want to settle on. Certain platforms offer tiered pricing, but other platforms, like Innago, offer syndication and additional automation processes for free. Maximizing profits begins with fewer vacancies. While interested renters present an opportunity to minimize vacancy rates, they also require tenant screening, which includes reference contact, credit and rental history checks and application reviews. Getting property management software can help you breeze through these responsibilities and explore other profit-maximizing avenues that will further grow your rental business in 2025.

Trump considers pausing his auto tariffs as the world economy endures whiplash,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-considers-pausing-his-auto-tariffs-as-the-world-economy-endures-whiplash-2025-04-14/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Monday suggested that he might temporarily exempt the auto industry from tariffs he previously imposed on the sector, to give carmakers time to adjust their supply chains. “I’m looking at something to help some of the car companies with it,” Trump told reporters gathered in the Oval Office. The Republican president said automakers needed time to relocate production from Canada, Mexico and other places, ""And they need a little bit of time because they’re going to make them here, but they need a little bit of time. So I’m talking about things like that.” Matt Blunt, president of American Automotive Policy Council, an association representing Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, said the group shared Trump's goals of increased domestic production. “There is increasing awareness that broad tariffs on parts could undermine our shared goal of building a thriving and growing American auto industry, and that many of these supply chain transitions will take time,"" Blunt said. Trump's statement hinted at yet another round of reversals on tariffs as Trump's onslaught of import taxes has panicked financial markets and raised deep concerns from Wall Street economists about a possible recession. When Trump announced the 25% auto tariffs on March 27, he described them as “permanent.” His hard lines on trade have become increasingly blurred as he has sought to limit the possible economic and political blowback from his policies. Last week, after a bond market sell-off pushed up interest rates on U.S. debt, Trump announced that for 90 days his broader tariffs against dozens of countries would instead be set at a baseline 10% to give time for negotiations. At the same time, Trump increased the import taxes on China to 145%, only to temporarily exempt electronics from some of those tariffs by having those goods charged at a 20% rate. “I don’t change my mind, but I’m flexible,” Trump said Monday. Trump's flexibility has also fueled a sense of uncertainty and confusion about his intentions and end goals. The S&P 500 stock index was up 0.8% Monday, but it's still down nearly 8% this year. Interest rates on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes were elevated at roughly 4.4%. Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist for the Northern Trust global financial firm, said the whiplash had been so great that he might have to “get fitted for a neck brace.” Tannenbaum warned in an analysis: “Damage to consumer, business, and market confidence may already be irreversible.” Maroš Šefčovič, the European commissioner for trade and economic security, posted on X on Monday that on behalf of the European Union he engaged in trade negotiations with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. ""The EU remains constructive and ready for a fair deal — including reciprocity through our 0-for-0 tariff offer on industrial goods and the work on non-tariff barriers,"" Šefčovič said. The U.S. president also said that he spoke with Apple CEO Tim Cook and “helped” him recently. Many Apple products, including its popular iPhone, are assembled in China. Apple didn’t respond to a Monday request for comment about the latest swings in the Trump administration’s tariff pendulum. Even if the exemptions granted on electronics last week turn out to be short-lived, the temporary reprieve gives Apple some breathing room to figure out ways to minimize the trade war’s impact on its iPhone sales in the U.S. That prospect helped lift Apple’s stock price 2% on Monday. Still, the stock gave up some of its earlier 7% increase as investors processed the possibility that the iPhone could still be jolted by more tariffs on Chinese-made products in the weeks ahead. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said Apple is clearly in a far better position than it was a week ago, but he warned there's still “mass uncertainty, chaos, and confusion about the next steps ahead.” One possible workaround Apple may be examining during the current tariff reprieve is how to shift even more of its iPhone production from its longtime hubs in China to India, where it began expanding its manufacturing while Trump waged a trade war during his first term as president. The Trump administration has suggested that its tariffs had isolated China as the U.S. engaged in talks with other countries. But China is also seeking to build tighter relationships in Asia with nations stung by Trump's tariffs. China’s leader, Xi Jinping, on Monday met in Hanoi with Vietnam's Communist Party General Secretary To Lam with the message that no one wins in trade wars. Asked about the meeting, Trump suggested the two nations were conspiring to do economic harm to the U.S. by “trying to figure out how do we screw the United States of America.” ___ Liedtke reported from San Francisco.

"Despite a court order, White House bars AP from Oval Office event",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/despite-a-court-order-white-house-bars-ap-from-oval-office-event-2025-04-14/,"Despite a court order, a reporter and photographer from The Associated Press were barred from an Oval Office news conference on Monday with President Donald Trump and his counterpart from El Salvador, Nayib Bukele. Last week's federal court decision forbidding the Trump administration from punishing the AP for refusing to rename the Gulf of Mexico was to take effect Monday. The administration is appealing the decision and arguing with the news outlet over whether it needs to change anything until those appeals are exhausted. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. circuit set a Thursday hearing on Trump's request that any changes be delayed while case is reviewed. The AP is fighting for more access as soon as possible. Since mid-February, AP reporters and photographers have been blocked from attending events in the Oval Office, where President Donald Trump frequently addresses journalists, and on Air Force One. The AP has seen sporadic access elsewhere, and regularly covers White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt’s briefings. Leavitt is one of three administration officials named in the AP's lawsuit. The dispute stems from AP’s decision not to follow the president’s executive order to rename the Gulf of Mexico, although AP style does cite Trump’s wish that it be called the Gulf of America. The AP argued – and U.S. District Judge Trevor N. McFadden agreed last week – that the government cannot punish the news organization for exercising its right to free speech. McFadden on Friday had rejected Trump’s request for more delay in implementing the ruling; now the president is asking an appeals court for the same thing. “We expect the White House to restore AP's participation in the (White House press) pool as of today, as provided in the injunction order,” AP spokeswoman Lauren Easton said Monday. The extent of AP's future access remains uncertain, even with the court decision. Until being blocked by Trump, AP has traditionally always had a reporter and photographer among the small group of journalists invited into the Oval Office. McFadden did not order that to be restored, only that no news organization should be shut out because the president objects to its news decisions — under a principle called “viewpoint discrimination.” “No other news organization in the United States receives the level of guaranteed access previously bestowed upon the AP,” the administration argued in court papers over the weekend. “The AP may have grown accustomed to its favored status, but the Constitution does not require that such status endure in perpetuity.” ___ David Bauder writes about media for the AP.

Nvidia plans to manufacture AI chips in the US for the first time,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/nvidia-plans-to-manufacture-ai-chips-in-the-us-for-the-first-time-2025-04-14/,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Nvidia announced Monday that it will produce its artificial intelligence super computers in the United States for the first time. The tech giant said it has commissioned more than one million square feet of manufacturing space to build and test its specialized Blackwell chips in Arizona and AI supercomputers in Texas — part of an investment the company said will produce up to half a trillion dollars of AI infrastructure in the next four years. “The engines of the world’s AI infrastructure are being built in the United States for the first time,” Nvidia founder Jensen Huang said in a statement. “Adding American manufacturing helps us better meet the incredible and growing demand for AI chips and supercomputers, strengthens our supply chain and boosts our resiliency.” Nvidia’s announcement comes as the Trump administration has said that tariff exemptions on electronics like smartphones and laptops are only a temporary reprieve until officials develop a new tariff approach specific to the semiconductor industry. White House officials, including President Donald Trump himself, spent Sunday downplaying the significance of exemptions that lessen but won’t eliminate the effect of U.S. tariffs on imports of popular consumer devices and their key components. “They’re exempt from the reciprocal tariffs but they’re included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two,” U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday. Nvidia said in a post on its website that it has started Blackwell production at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. chip plants in Phoenix. The Santa Clara, California-based chip company is also building supercomputer manufacturing plants in Texas — with Foxconn in Houston and Wistron in Dallas. Nvidia's AI super computers will serve as the engines for AI factories, “a new type of data center created for the sole purpose of processing artificial intelligence,” the company said, adding that manufacturing in the U.S. will create “hundreds of thousands of jobs and drive trillions of dollars in economic security over the coming decades."" Mass production at both plants is expected to ramp up in the next 12-15 months, Nvidia said. The company also plans on partnering with Taiwan-based company SPIL and Amkor for “packaging and testing operations” in Arizona. In a statement Monday, the White House called Nvidia’s move “the Trump Effect in action.” Trump “has made U.S.-based chips manufacturing a priority as part of his relentless pursuit of an American manufacturing renaissance, and it’s paying off — with trillions of dollars in new investments secured in the tech sector alone,” the White House said. Earlier this year, Trump announced a joint venture investing up to $500 billion for infrastructure tied to artificial intelligence by a new partnership formed by OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank. The new entity, Stargate, was tasked with building out data centers and the electricity generation needed for the further development of the fast-evolving AI in Texas, according to the White House. The initial investment is expected to be $100 billion and could reach five times that sum. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

A fugitive Indian jeweler accused of a $1.8bn bank fraud has been arrested in Belgium,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/a-fugitive-indian-jeweler-accused-of-a-18bn-bank-fraud-has-been-arrested-in-belgium-2025-04-14/,"NEW DELHI (AP) — Fugitive Indian jeweler Mehul Choksi, who has been accused of involvement in one of India’s biggest bank frauds, has been arrested in Belgium, his lawyer said Monday. Choksi and his diamond tycoon nephew Nirav Modi are accused of a $1.8 billion fraud involving Punjab National Bank, the country’s second-largest public lender. Both fled India in 2018. The arrest was made following an extradition request by Indian authorities, local media reported. Choksi was arrested on Saturday in the Belgian port city of Antwerp, one of the most important diamond trading hubs in the world. His lawyer, Vijay Aggarwal, told reporters that Choksi's legal team would file an appeal for his release. Both Choksi and Modi have denied the accusations. Punjab National Bank accused Choksi, Modi and others of fraud by using fake financial documents to get loans to buy and import jewels. Aggarwal said the “obvious” grounds for the appeal would be that Choksi is “not a flight risk, is extremely sick and undergoing treatment for cancer.” He also said they would argue that Choksi's was a “political” case and mount their defense on grounds that Indian prisons have inhumane conditions. Modi, who built an international jewelry empire that stretched from India to New York and Hong Kong, was arrested in Britain in 2019. He has been in prison since.

3 High-Yield Dividend Stocks Trading at a Discount,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/3-high-yield-dividend-stocks-trading-at-a-discount/,"Investors commonly see dividend-paying stocks as a stable, defensive part of a portfolio. These firms should, in theory, pay out a steady stream of passive income in the form of regular dividend payments made possible by the company's continued operational success. Thus, some of the most popular dividend names are blue-chip names like Coca-Cola Co. NYSE: KO and Procter & Gamble Co. NYSE: PG. There is another way for investors with a greater risk tolerance to approach dividend names as well. Particularly given the recent turbulence in the market, several dividend-paying names have experienced significant price drops that have brought them into penny stock territory. To be sure, companies like Global Self Storage NASDAQ: SELF, ACCO Brands Corp. NYSE: ACCO, and Mativ Holdings Inc. NYSE: MATIV do not have the stability of a Coca-Cola or P&G, and their ability to continue to pay dividends—or to continue to pay them at the same sustained level—is not nearly as secure as those larger firms. However, each of these companies is trading at a relative discount, and each has the support of at least one optimistic Wall Street analyst. As a real estate investment trust (REIT), Global Self Storage must pay investors 90% or more of its taxable income in disbursements. Unlike some REITs, which focus on office or data center properties and are heavily tied to the economy's overall strength, Global's purview is self-storage properties. Given low operating costs and relatively stable demand, the self-storage business could constitute a reasonable defensive play in markets that are not oversaturated with options. Although it has declined by nearly 7% year-to-date (YTD), Global has outperformed the S&P 500 over April 11, 2025. The company has a dividend yield of 5.88% and marginal annualized 3-year dividend growth. With a dividend payout ratio of more than 161%, Global may be at risk of overpaying dividends. This may be one reason why the company recently agreed to an at-market offering of up to $15 million of common stock in partnership with Alliance Global Partners. The firm also beat analyst predictions for EPS in the most recent quarter by a healthy margin of 11 cents per share. With a whopping 8.21% dividend yield, dividend investors are likely to consider office and school supply manufacturer ACCO Brands. But the huge yield comes with a few important caveats. First, ACCO has experienced a declining top line for the last several years, and uncertainties around the potential impact of tariffs further threaten the company's sales. Due to impairment charges, net income has also been negative in multiple recent periods. However, the company has been able to generate substantial free cash flows of at least $100 million per year. ACCO's efforts to cut costs have improved margins and reduced debt load in recent months, further making the stock more attractive to investors. Still, shares are down about 30% YTD as of April 11, although that has given the company a price-to-sales ratio of just 0.2. For investors optimistic that the company will navigate the tariff environment smoothly and turn around sales trends, Barrington Research shares in this optimism and has assigned ACCO a Buy rating and a price target of $7.00 per share, just about double the current price point. Specialty materials manufacturer Mativ Holdings may be our list's highest-risk, highest-reward play. The company's operations leave it potentially exposed to significant tariff risk, and as of April 11, it had experienced a 55% share price decline YTD, compounded by an earnings miss in February. On the other hand, though, Mativ offers the highest dividend yield of these three firms at 8.27%, and analysts at Stifel Nicolaus upgraded the firm from Hold to Buy in March, setting a price target of $10. This is more than double the current price of MATV shares. Investors seeking dividends and willing to take a risk could see big rewards for an investment in Mativ, if that prediction comes to pass.

Meta says it will resume AI training with public content from European users,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/meta-says-it-will-resume-ai-training-with-public-content-from-european-users-2025-04-14/,"LONDON (AP) — Social media company Meta said Monday that it will start using publicly available content from European users to train its artificial intelligence models, resuming work put on hold last year after activists raised concerns about data privacy. The company, which owns Facebook and Instagram, said that it would train its AI systems using public posts and comments shared by adult users in the 27-nation European Union. “People’s interactions with Meta AI — like questions and queries — will also be used to train and improve our models,” the company said in a blog post. Meta is making the move after launching its Meta AI assistant last month for European users, long after it rolled out to the United States and other major markets. The company's AI training efforts had been hampered by stringent European Union data privacy laws, which give people control over how their personal information is used. Vienna-based group NOYB, led by activist Max Schrems, had complained to various national privacy watchdogs about Meta’s AI training plans and urged them to stop the company before it started training its next generation of AI models. Meta noted that a panel of EU privacy regulators in December “affirmed” that its original approach met legal obligations. The company said it won't use private messages to train its AI model and repeated its point that it is merely following the example of rivals Google and OpenAI, “both of which have already used data from European users to train their AI models."" Meta said it will start notifying users in the EU about the training, and will include a link to a form where they can object at any time. “We'll honor all objection forms,” the company said.

Intel sells majority stake in Altera to Silver Lake investors in a deal valued at $8.75 billion,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/intel-sells-majority-stake-in-altera-to-silver-lake-investors-in-a-deal-valued-at-875-billion-2025-04-14/,"Intel announced Monday that it was selling the majority of its Altera chip business to technology investor Silver Lake in a deal valued at $8.75 billion. Silver Lake will own 51% of Altera, which Intel acquired in 2015 for $16.7 billion in an effort to expand its business into chip markets focused on wireless, automobiles and other products. At the time, it was the biggest deal in Intel Corp.'s history. Intel spun Altera off into an independent company earlier this year. Silver Lake's acquisition of Altera is expected to close in the second half of this year. “Today’s announcement reflects our commitment to sharpening our focus, lowering our expense structure and strengthening our balance sheet,” said Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan. ”We look forward to partnering with Silver Lake upon closing of the transaction, as their industry expertise will help to accelerate Altera’s efforts and unlock additional economic value for Intel."" Tan joined Intel as CEO just one month ago. Intel also announced that Raghib Hussain will succeed Sandra Rivera as chief executive officer of Altera, effective in early May. Intel shares were up 3.2% just after the opening bell Monday. The broader technology sector was boosted Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Friday said he was exempting smartphones, computers and some other electronics from some of his stiff tariffs. Trump then spent Sunday downplaying the significance of exemptions that reduce but won’t eliminate the effect of U.S. tariffs on imports of popular consumer devices and their key components.
