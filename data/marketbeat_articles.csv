Asian shares are mixed after Wall Street sets more records for US stocks,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/asian-shares-are-mixed-after-wall-street-sets-more-records-for-us-stocks-2025-07-27/,"BANGKOK (AP) — Stock markets in Asia were mixed on Monday after U.S. stocks rose to more records as they closed out another winning week. U.S. futures and oil prices were higher ahead of trade talks in Stockholm between U.S. and Chinese officials. European futures rose after the European Union forged a deal with the Trump administration calling for 15% tariffs on most exports to the U.S. The agreement announced after President Donald Trump and European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen met briefly at Trump’s Turnberry golf course in Scotland staves off far higher import duties on both sides that might have sent shock waves through economies around the globe. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index lost 1% to 41,056.81 after doubts surfaced over what exactly the trade truce between Japan and U.S. President Donald Trump, especially the $550 billion pledge of investment in the U.S. by Japan, will entail. Terms of the deal are still being negotiated and nothing has been formalized in writing, said an official, who insisted on anonymity to detail the terms of the talks. The official suggested the goal was for a $550 billion fund to make investments at Trump’s direction. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index gained 0.4% to 25,490.45 while the Shanghai Composite index lost 0.2% to 3,587.25. Taiwan's Taiex rose 0.3%. CK Hutchison, a Hong Kong conglomerate that’s selling ports at the Panama Canal, said it may seek a Chinese investor to join a consortium of buyers in a move that might please Beijing but could also bring more U.S. scrutiny to a geopolitically fraught deal. CK Hutchison's shares fell 0.6% on Monday in Hong Kong. Elsewhere in Asia, South Korea's Kospi was little changed at 3,195.49, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.3% to 8,688.40. India's Sensex slipped 0.1%. Markets in Thailand were closed for a holiday. On Friday, the S&P 500 rose 0.4% to 6,388.64, setting an all-time for the fifth time in a week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.5% to 44,901.92, while the Nasdaq composite added 0.2%, closing at 21,108.32 to top its own record. Deckers, the company behind Ugg boots and Hoka shoes, jumped 11.3% after reporting stronger profit and revenue for the spring than analysts expected. Its growth was particularly strong outside the United States, where revenue soared nearly 50%. But Intell fell 8.5% after reporting a loss for the latest quarter, when analysts were looking for a profit. The struggling chipmaker also said it would cut thousands of jobs  and eliminate other expenses as it tries to turn around its fortunes. Intel, which helped launch Silicon Valley as the U.S. technology hub, has fallen behind rivals like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices while demand for artificial intelligence chips soars. Companies are under pressure to deliver solid growth in profits to justify big gains for their stock prices, which have rallied to record after record in recent weeks. Wall Street has zoomed higher on hopes that President Donald Trump will reach trade deals with other countries that will lower his stiff proposed tariffs, along with the risk that they could cause a recession and drive up inflation. Trump has recently announced deals with Japan and the Philippines, and the next big deadline is looming on Friday, Aug. 1. Apart from trade talks, this week will also feature a meeting by the Federal Reserve on interest rates. Trump again on Thursday lobbied the Fed to cut rates, which he has implied could save the U.S. government money on its debt repayments. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said he is waiting for more data about how Trump’s tariffs affect the economy and inflation before making a move. The widespread expectation on Wall Street is that the Fed will wait until September to resume cutting interest rates. In other dealings early Monday, U.S. benchmark crude oil gained 24 cents to $65.40 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, also added 24 cents to $67.90 per barrel. The dollar rose to 147.72 Japanese yen from 147.71 yen. The euro slipped to $1.1755 from $1.1758. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

"As Dubai cracks down on crowded jerry-rigged apartments, migrant workers have nowhere else to go",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/as-dubai-cracks-down-on-crowded-jerry-rigged-apartments-migrant-workers-have-nowhere-else-to-go-2025-07-27/,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Lights flicker, doors hang off their hinges and holes in the walls expose pipes in the apartment building where Hesham, an Egyptian migrant worker, lives in Dubai, an emirate better known for its flashy skyscrapers and penthouses. His two-bedroom rental unit is carved up to house nine other men, and what he calls home is a modified closet just big enough for a mattress. But now the government has ordered the 44-year-old salesman out of even that cramped space, which costs him $270 a month. He's one of the many low-paid foreign laborers caught up in a widespread crackdown by authorities in Dubai over illegal subletting. That includes rooms lined with bunk beds that offer no privacy but are as cheap as a few dollars a night, as well as partitioned apartments like Hesham's, where plywood boards, drywall and plastic shower curtains can turn a flat into a makeshift dormitory for 10 or 20 people. After a blaze at a high-rise in June, Dubai officials launched the campaign over concerns that partitioned apartments represent a major fire risk. Some of those evicted have been left scrambling to stay off the streets, where begging is illegal. Others fear they could be next, uncertain when or where inspectors might show up. “Now we don’t know what we’ll do,” said Hesham, who's staying put until his landlord evicts him. Like others living in Dubai's cheapest and most crowded spaces, he spoke to The Associated Press on condition only his first name be used for fear of coming into the crosshairs of authorities enforcing the ban on illegal housing. “We don’t have any other choice,"" he said. Dubai Municipality, which oversees the city-state, declined an AP request for an interview. In a statement, it said authorities have conducted inspections across the emirate to curb fire and safety hazards — an effort it said would “ensure the highest standards of public safety” and lead to “enhanced quality of life” for tenants. It didn't address where those unable to afford legal housing would live in a city-state that’s synonymous with luxury yet outlaws labor unions and guarantees no minimum wage. Dubai has seen a boom since the pandemic that shows no signs of stopping. Its population of 3.9 million is projected to grow to 5.8 million by 2040 as more people move into the commercial hub from abroad. Much of Dubai’s real estate market caters to wealthy foreign professionals living there long-term. That leaves few affordable options for the majority of workers — migrants on temporary, low-wage contracts, often earning just several hundred dollars a month. Nearly a fifth of homes in Dubai were worth more than $1 million as of last year, property firm Knight Frank said. Developers are racing to build more high-end housing. That continued growth has meant rising rents across the board. Short-term rentals are expected to cost 18% more by the end of this year compared to 2024, according to online rental company Colife. Most migrant workers the AP spoke to said they make just $300 to $550 a month. In lower-income areas, they said, a partitioned apartment space generally rents for $220 to $270 a month, while a single bunk in an undivided room costs half as much. Both can cost less if shared, or more depending on size and location. At any rate, they are far cheaper than the average one-bedroom rental, which real estate firm Engel & Völkers said runs about $1,400 a month. The United Arab Emirates, like other Gulf Arab nations, relies on low-paid workers from Africa and Asia to build, clean, babysit and drive taxi cabs. Only Emirati nationals, who are outnumbered nearly 9 to 1 by residents from foreign countries, are eligible for an array of government benefits, including financial assistance for housing. Large employers, from construction firms and factories to hotels and resorts, are required by law to house workers if they are paid less than $400 a month, much of which they send home to families overseas. However, many migrants are employed informally, making their living arrangements hard to regulate, said Steffen Hertog, an expert on Gulf labor markets at the London School of Economics and Political Science. The crackdown will push up their housing costs, creating “a lot of stress for people whose life situation is already precarious,” he said. Hassan, a 24-year-old security guard from Uganda, shares a bed in a partitioned apartment with a friend. So far, the government hasn’t discovered it, but he has reason to be nervous, he said. “They can tell you to leave without an option, without anywhere to go.” Dubai has targeted overcrowded apartments in the past amid a spate of high-rise fires fueled by flammable siding material. The latest round of inspections came after a blaze in June at a 67-story tower in the Dubai Marina neighborhood, where some apartments had been partitioned. More than 3,800 residents were forced to evacuate from the building, which had 532 occupied apartments, according to a police report. That means seven people on average lived in each of these units in the tower of one-, two- and three-bedroom flats. Dozens of homes were left uninhabitable. There were no major injuries in that fire. However, another in 2023 in Dubai’s historic Deira neighborhood killed at least 16 people and injured another nine in a unit believed to have been partitioned. Ebony, a 28-year-old odd-job worker from Ghana, was recently forced to leave a partitioned apartment after the authorities found out about it. She lived in a narrow space with a roommate who slept above her on a jerry-built plywood loft bed. “Sometimes to even stand up,” she said, “your head is going to hit the plywood.” She’s in a new apartment now, a single room that holds 14 others — and sometimes more than 20 as people come and go, sharing beds. With her income of about $400 a month, she said she didn’t have another option, and she’s afraid of being forced out again. “I don’t know what they want us to do. Maybe they don’t want the majority of people that are here in Dubai,” Ebony said. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

Hong Kong's CK Hutchison seeks Chinese investor to join Panama Ports deal,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/hong-kongs-ck-hutchison-seeks-chinese-investor-to-join-panama-ports-deal-2025-07-27/,"HONG KONG (AP) — A Hong Kong conglomerate that's selling ports at the Panama Canal said Monday it may seek a Chinese investor to join a consortium of buyers, a move that could please Beijing but bring more U.S. scrutiny to the geopolitically fraught deal. CK Hutchison Holdings’ initial plan to sell port assets in dozens of countries to a group that includes U.S. investment firm BlackRock Inc. pleased President Donald Trump, who has alleged that China interferes with the critical shipping lane’s operations in Panama. However, they apparently angered Beijing and drew a review from Chinese anti-monopoly authorities. A Beijing-backed newspaper posted scathing commentaries about the deal, with one describing it as a betrayal of all Chinese. Beijing’s offices overseeing Hong Kong affairs have reposted some of these commentaries, widely seen as an indication of Chinese leaders’ stance. A Hutchison subsidiary has operated ports at both ends of the Panama Canal since 1997. After months of uncertainty brought by tensions between Washington and Beijing, Hutchison said in a statement that the exclusive negotiations period with the consortium has expired. However, it added “the Group remains in discussions with members of the consortium with a view to inviting major strategic investor from the PRC to join as a significant member of the consortium,” referring to the People’s Republic of China. It said they needed to change the membership of the consortium and the structure of the transaction for the deal to be able to pass reviews by “all relevant authorities."" The awkward position Hutchison found itself in for months highlights the challenges Hong Kong business elites face in navigating Beijing’s expectations of national loyalty, especially when relations between China and the United States are strained. Hong Kong has overhauled its electoral system to ensure the city is run by “patriots.” CK Hutchison is owned by the family of Hong Kong’s richest man, Li Ka-shing. It announced March 4 that it would sell all its shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and in Hutchison Port Group Holdings to the consortium that also includes BlackRock subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners and Terminal Investment Limited, a subsidiary of the Mediterranean Shipping Company. In May, Hutchinson co-managing director, Dominic Lai told shareholders that Terminal Investment was the main investor. Its parent company is led by Italian shipping scion Diego Aponte, whose family reportedly has a longstanding relationship with Li’s. The initial deal, valued at nearly $23 billion including $5 billion in debt, would have given the consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including the ports of Balboa and Cristobal, located at either end of the canal. That agreement also required approval from Panama’s government. The deadline for their exclusive negotiation period ended on July 27. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

US and China to talk in Stockholm on trade with eye on Trump-Xi summit later this year,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/us-and-china-to-talk-in-stockholm-on-trade-with-eye-on-trump-xi-summit-later-this-year-2025-07-27/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — When top U.S. and Chinese officials meet in Stockholm, they are almost certain to agree to at least leaving tariffs at the current levels while working toward a meeting between their presidents later this year for a more lasting trade deal between the world's two largest economies, analysts say. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng are set to hold talks Monday for the third time this year — this round in the Swedish capital, nearly four months after President Donald Trump upset global trade with his sweeping tariff proposal, including an import tax that shot up to 145% on Chinese goods. “We have the confines of a deal with China,” Trump said Friday before leaving for Scotland. Bessent told MSNBC on Wednesday that the two countries after talks in Geneva and London have reached a “status quo,” with the U.S. taxing imported goods from China at 30% and China responding with a 10% tariff, on top of tariffs prior to the start of Trump's second term. “Now we can move on to discussing other matters in terms of bringing the economic relationship into balance,” Bessent said. He was referring to the U.S. running a $295.5 billion trade deficit last year. The U.S. seeks an agreement that would enable it to export more to China and shift the Chinese economy more toward domestic consumer spending. The Chinese embassy in Washington said Beijing hopes “there will be more consensus and cooperation and less misperception” coming out of the talks. With an eye on a possible leaders' summit, Stockholm could provide some answers as to the timeline and viability of that particular goal ahead of a possible meeting between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. “The meeting will be important in starting to set the stage for a fall meeting between Trump and Xi,” said Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. trade negotiator and now vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute. “Beijing will likely insist on detailed preparations before they agree to a leaders’ meeting.” In Stockholm, the two sides are likely to focus on commercial announcements to be made at a leaders’ summit as well as agreements to address “major irritants,” such as China's industrial overcapacity and its lack of control over chemicals used to make fentanyl, also to be announced when Xi and Trump should meet, Cutler said. Sean Stein, president of the U.S.-China Business Council, said Stockholm could be the first real opportunity for the two governments to address structural reform issues including market access in China for U.S. companies. What businesses will be seeking coming out of Stockholm would largely be “the atmosphere” — how the two sides characterize the discussions. They will also look for clues about a possible leaders’ summit because any real deal will hinge on the two presidents meeting each other, he said. In Stockholm, Beijing will likely demand the removal of the 20% fentanyl-related tariff that Trump imposed earlier this year, said Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Washington-based Stimson Center. This round of the U.S.-China trade dispute began with fentanyl, when Trump in February imposed a 10% tariff on Chinese goods, citing that China failed to curb the outflow of the chemicals used to make the drug. The following month, Trump added another 10% tax for the same reason. Beijing retaliated with extra duties on some U.S. goods, including coal, liquefied natural gas, and farm products such as beef, chicken, pork and soy. In Geneva, both sides climbed down from three-digit tariffs rolled out following Trump's “Liberation Day” tariffs in April, but the U.S. kept the 20% “fentanyl” tariffs, in addition to the 10% baseline rate — to which China responded by keeping the same 10% rate on U.S. products. These across-the-board duties were unchanged when the two sides met in London a month later to negotiate over non-tariff measures such as export controls on critical products. The Chinese government has long protested that American politicians blame China for the fentanyl crisis in the U.S. but argued the root problem lies with the U.S. itself. Washington says Beijing is not doing enough to regulate precursor chemicals that flow out of China into the hands of drug dealers. In July, China placed two fentanyl ingredients under enhanced control, a move seen as in response to U.S. pressure and signaling goodwill. Gabriel Wildau, managing director at the consultancy Teneo, said he doesn't expect any tariff to go away in Stockholm but that tariff relief could be part of a final trade deal. “It’s possible that Trump would cancel the 20% tariff that he has explicitly linked with fentanyl, but I would expect the final tariff level on China to be at least as high as the 15-20% rate contained in the recent deals with Japan, Indonesia, Vietnam,” Wildau said. China's industrial overcapacity is as much a headache for the United States as it is for the European Union. Even Beijing has acknowledged the problem but suggested it might be difficult to address. America’s trade imbalance with China has decreased from a peak of $418 billion in 2018, according to the Census Bureau. But China has found new markets for its goods and as the world’s dominant manufacturer ran a global trade surplus approaching $1 trillion last year — somewhat larger than the size of the U.S. overall trade deficit in 2024. And China’s emergence as a manufacturer of electric vehicles and other emerging technologies has suddenly made it more of a financial and geopolitical threat for those same industries based in the U.S., Europe, Japan and South Korea. “Some enterprises, especially manufacturing enterprises, feel more deeply that China’s manufacturing capabilities are too strong, and Chinese people are too hardworking. Factories run 24 hours a day,” Chinese Premier Li Qiang said on Thursday when hosting European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in Beijing. “Some people think this will cause some new problems in the balance of supply and demand in world production.” “We see this problem too,” Li said. Bessent also said the Stockholm talks could address Chinese purchases of Russian and Iranian oil. However, Wildau of Teneo said China could demand some U.S. security concessions in exchange, such as a reduced U.S. military presence in East Asia and scaled-back diplomatic support for Taiwan and the Philippines. This would likely face political pushback in Washington. The Stockholm talks will be “geared towards building a trade agreement based around Chinese purchase commitments and pledges of investment in the U.S. in exchange for partial relief from U.S. tariffs and export controls,” Wildau said. He doubts there will be a grand deal. Instead, he predicts “a more limited agreement based around fentanyl.” “That,” he said, “is probably the preferred outcome for China hawks in the Trump administration, who worry that an overeager Trump might offer too much to Xi.” ___ Associated Press writer Paul Wiseman contributed to this report Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

US-EU trade deal wards off further escalation but will raise costs for companies and consumers,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/us-eu-trade-deal-wards-off-further-escalation-but-will-raise-costs-for-companies-consumers-2025-07-27/,"FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen have announced a sweeping trade deal that imposes 15% tariffs on most European goods, warding off Trump's threat of a 30% rate if no deal had been reached by Aug. 1. The tariffs, or import taxes, paid when Americans buy European products could raise prices for U.S. consumers and dent profits for European companies and their partners who bring goods into the country. Here are some things to know about the trade deal between the United States and the European Union: Trump and von der Leyen's announcement, made during Trump's visit to one of his golf courses in Scotland, leaves many details to be filled in. The headline figure is a 15% tariff rate on “the vast majority” of European goods brought into the U.S., including cars, computer chips and pharmaceuticals. It's lower than the 20% Trump initially proposed, and lower than his threats of 50% and then 30%. Von der Leyen said the two sides agreed on zero tariffs on both sides for a range of “strategic” goods: Aircraft and aircraft parts, certain chemicals, semiconductor equipment, certain agricultural products, and some natural resources and critical raw materials. Specifics were lacking. She said the two sides “would keep working” to add more products to the list. Additionally, the EU side would purchase what Trump said was $750 billion (638 billion euros) worth of natural gas, oil and nuclear fuel to replace Russian energy supplies, and Europeans would invest an additional $600 billion (511 billion euros) in the U.S. Trump said the 50% U.S. tariff on imported steel would remain; von der Leyen said the two sides agreed to further negotiations to fight a global steel glut, reduce tariffs and establish import quotas — that is, set amounts that can be imported, often at a lower rate. Trump said pharmaceuticals were not included in the deal. Von der Leyen said the pharmaceuticals issue was “on a separate sheet of paper” from Sunday's deal. Where the $600 billion for additional investment would come from was not specified. And von der Leyen said that when it came to farm products, the EU side made clear that “there were tariffs that could not be lowered,” without specifying which products. The 15% rate removes Trump's threat of a 30% tariff. It's still much higher than the average tariff before Trump came into office of around 1%, and higher than Trump's minimum 10% baseline tariff. Higher tariffs, or import taxes, on European goods mean sellers in the U.S. would have to either increase prices for consumers — risking loss of market share — or swallow the added cost in terms of lower profits. The higher tariffs are expected to hurt export earnings for European firms and slow the economy. The 10% baseline applied while the deal was negotiated was already sufficiently high to make the European Union's executive commission cut its growth forecast for this year from 1.3% to 0.9%. Von der Leyen said the 15% rate was “the best we could do” and credited the deal with maintaining access to the U.S. market and providing “stability and predictability for companies on both sides.” German Chancellor Friedrich Merz welcomed the deal which avoided “an unnecessary escalation in transatlantic trade relations"" and said that “we were able to preserve our core interests,” while adding that “I would have very much wished for further relief in transatlantic trade.” The Federation of German Industries was blunter. ""Even a 15% tariff rate will have immense negative effects on export-oriented German industry,"" said Wolfgang Niedermark, a member of the federation's leadership. While the rate is lower than threatened, ""the big caveat to today’s deal is that there is nothing on paper, yet,"" said Carsten Brzeski, global chief of macro at ING bank. “With this disclaimer in mind and at face value, today’s agreement would clearly bring an end to the uncertainty of recent months. An escalation of the US-EU trade tensions would have been a severe risk for the global economy,"" Brzeski said. “This risk seems to have been avoided.” Asked if European carmakers could still sell cars at 15%, von der Leyen said the rate was much lower than the current 27.5%. That has been the rate under Trump's 25% tariff on cars from all countries, plus the preexisting U.S. car tariff of 2.5%. The impact is likely to be substantial on some companies, given that automaker Volkswagen said it suffered a 1.3 billion euro ($1.5 billion) hit to profit in the first half of the year from the higher tariffs. Mercedes-Benz dealers in the U.S. have said they are holding the line on 2025 model year prices “until further notice.” The German automaker has a partial tariff shield because it makes 35% of the Mercedes-Benz vehicles sold in the U.S. in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, but the company said it expects prices to undergo “significant increases” in coming years. Before Trump returned to office, the U.S. and the EU maintained generally low tariff levels in what is the largest bilateral trading relationship in the world, with some 1.7 trillion euros ($2 trillion) in annual trade. Together the U.S. and the EU have 44% of the global economy. The U.S. rate averaged 1.47% for European goods, while the EU's averaged 1.35% for American products, according to the Bruegel think tank in Brussels. Trump has complained about the EU’s 198 billion-euro trade surplus in goods, which shows Americans buy more from European businesses than the other way around, and has said the European market is not open enough for U.S.-made cars. However, American companies fill some of the trade gap by outselling the EU when it comes to services such as cloud computing, travel bookings, and legal and financial services. And some 30% of European imports are from American-owned companies, according to the European Central Bank. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

Boeing's fighter jet workers in the St. Louis area reject a contract offer,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/boeings-fighter-jet-workers-in-the-st-louis-area-reject-a-contract-offer-2025-07-27/,"Boeing Co. expects more than 3,200 union workers at three St. Louis-area plants that produce U.S. fighter jets to strike after they rejected a proposed contract Sunday that included a 20% wage increase over four years. The International Machinists and Aerospace Workers union said the vote by District 837 members was overwhelmingly against the proposed contract. The existing contract was to expire at 11:59 p.m. Central time Sunday, but the union said a “cooling off” period would keep a strike from beginning for another week, until Aug. 4. Union leaders had recommended approving the offer, calling it a “landmark” agreement when it was announced last week. Organizers said then that the offer would improve medical, pension and overtime benefits in addition to pay. The vote came two days before Boeing planned to announce its second quarter earnings, after saying earlier this month that it had delivered 150 commercial airliners and 36 military aircraft and helicopters during the quarter, up from 130 and 26 during the first quarter. Its stock closed Friday at $233.06 a share, up $1.79. The union did not say specifically why members rejected the contract, only that it “fell short of addressing the priorities and sacrifices” of the union’s workers. Last fall, Boeing offered a general wage increase of 38% over four years to end a 53-day strike by 33,000 aircraft workers producing passenger aircraft. “Our members are standing together to demand a contract that respects their work and ensures a secure future,” the union said in a statement. Dan Gillan, general manager and senior Boeing executive in St. Louis, said in a statement that the company is “focused on preparing for a strike.” He described the proposal as “the richest contract offer” ever presented to the St. Louis union. “No talks are scheduled with the union,” said Gillan, who is also vice president for Boeing Air Dominance, the division for the production of several military jets, including the U.S. Navy's Super Hornet, as well as the Air Force's Red Hawk training aircraft.

Russia starts direct commercial flights between Moscow and Pyongyang,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/russia-starts-direct-commercial-flights-between-moscow-and-pyongyang-2025-07-27/,"MOSCOW (AP) — Russia on Sunday opened a regular air link between Moscow and Pyogyang, a move reflecting increasingly close ties between the two countries. The first flight operated by Russian carrier Nordwind took off from Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport carrying over 400 passengers. Russia's Transport Ministry said there will be one flight a month to meet demand. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who visited North Korea's new Wonsan-Kalma beach resort earlier this month to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, promised to encourage Russian tourists to visit the complex. The resort, which can accommodate nearly 20,000 people, is at the center of Kim’s push to boost tourism to improve his country’s troubled economy. North Korea has been slowly easing the curbs imposed during the pandemic and reopening its borders in phases. But the country hasn’t said if it would fully resume international tourism. Regular flights between Russia’s eastern port city of Vladivostok and Pyongyang reopened in 2023 following a break caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Russia and North Korea have sharply expanded military and other ties in recent years, with Pyongyang supplying weapons and troops to back Russia’s military action in Ukraine.

‘Fantastic Four: First Steps’ scores Marvel's first $100 million box office opening of 2025,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/fantastic-four-first-steps-scores-marvels-first-100-million-box-office-opening-of-2025-2025-07-27/,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Marvel’s first family has finally found box office gold. “The Fantastic Four: First Steps,” the first film about the superheroes made under the guidance of Kevin Feige and the Walt Disney Co., earned $118 million in its first weekend in 4,125 North American theaters, according to studio estimates Sunday. That makes it the fourth biggest opening of the year, behind “A Minecraft Movie,” “Lilo & Stitch” and “Superman,” and the biggest Marvel opening since “Deadpool & Wolverine” grossed $211 million out of the gate last summer. Internationally, “Fantastic Four” made $100 million from 52 territories, adding up to a $218 million worldwide debut. The numbers were within the range the studio was expecting. The film arrived in the wake of another big superhero reboot, James Gunn's “Superman,” which opened three weekends ago and has already crossed $500 million globally. That film, from the other main player in comic book films, DC Studios, took second place with $24.9 million domestically. The box office success of “First Steps” and “Superman” means “the whole notion of superhero fatigue, which has been talked about a lot, can I think be put to rest. I always say it’s bad movie fatigue, not superhero fatigue,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for data firm Comscore. “First Steps” is the latest attempt at bringing the superhuman family to the big screen, following lackluster performances for other versions. The film, based on the original Marvel comics, is set during the 1960s in a retro-futuristic world led by the Fantastic Four, a family of astronauts-turned-superhuman from exposure to cosmic rays during a space mission. The family is made up of Reed Richards (Pedro Pascal), who can stretch his body to incredible lengths; Sue Storm (Vanessa Kirby), who can render herself invisible; Johnny Storm (Joseph Quinn), who transforms into a fiery human torch; and Ben Grimm (Ebon Moss-Bachrach), who possesses tremendous superhuman strength with his stone-like flesh. The movie takes place four years after the family gained powers, during which Reed’s inventions have transformed technology, and Sue’s diplomacy has led to global peace. Both audiences and critics responded positively to the film, which currently has an 88% on Rotten Tomatoes and promising exit poll responses from opening weekend ticket buyers. An estimated 46% of audiences chose to see it on premium screens, including IMAX and other large formats. The once towering Marvel is working to rebuild audience enthusiasm for its films and characters. Its two previous offerings this year did not reach the cosmic box office heights of “Deadpool & Wolverine,"" which made over $1.3 billion, or those of the “Avengers”-era. But critically, the films have been on an upswing since the poorly reviewed “Captain America: Brave New World,” which ultimately grossed $415 million worldwide. “Thunderbolts,"" which jumpstarted the summer movie season, was better received critically but financially is capping out at just over $382 million globally. Like Deadpool and Wolverine, the Fantastic Four characters had been under the banner of 20th Century Fox for years. The studio produced two critically loathed, but decently profitable attempts in the mid-2000s with future Captain America Chris Evans as the Human Torch. In 2015, it tried again (unsuccessfully) with Michael B. Jordan and Miles Teller. They got another chance after Disney's $71 billion acquisition of Fox’s entertainment assets in 2019. The “Fantastic Four's” opening weekend results were a little less than some rival studio projections, Dergarabedian said. Nonetheless, the film is expected to carry movie theater earnings well into August. Holdovers dominated the top 10, but one other newcomer managed to make the chart. The dark romantic comedy “Oh, Hi!” earned $1.1 million from 866 screens. “Jurassic World Rebirth” landed in third place in its fourth weekend with $13 million, followed by “F1” with $6.2 million. The Brad Pitt racing movie also passed $500 million globally. “Smurfs” rounded out the top five with $5.4 million in its second weekend. The box office is currently up over 12% from last year. With final domestic figures being released Monday, this list factors in the estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore: 1. “The Fantastic Four: First Steps,” $118 million. 2. “Superman,” $24.9 million. 3. “Jurassic World Rebirth,” $13 million. 4. “F1: The Movie,” $6.2 million. 5. “Smurfs,” $5.4 million. 6. “I Know What You Did Last Summer,” $5.1 million. 7. “How to Train Your Dragon,” $2.8 million. 8. “Eddington,” $1.7 million. 9. “Saiyaara,” $1.3 million. 10. “Oh, Hi!,” $1.1 million.

PEGA Surges 14%: There's Still Time to Ride This GenAI Innovator,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/pega-surges-14-theres-still-time-to-ride-this-genai-innovator/,"For the second quarter in a row, artificial intelligence (AI) tech stock Pegasystems NASDAQ: PEGA crushed expectations. Shares soared 14% on July 22 as the company eclipsed Wall Street analyst forecasts. The company’s GenAI Blueprint product is gaining serious traction, putting the firm in a position to be a huge winner as AI evolves. Let’s examine Pegasystems’ latest results and explain why investors should pay attention to this stock. In Q2, Pega posted sales of just under $385 million for a growth rate of 9.5%. This surpassed estimates by nearly $40 million. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.28 equated to a growth rate of 7.7%. Analysts predicted the figure would instead decline by 7.7%. The company’s growth rate may seem modest until investors consider Pega’s annual contract value (ACV) growth rate of 14%. ACV calculates the revenue growth that the company can expect to receive on an annual basis through its subscription model. Because it measures the revenue Pega can expect going forward, ACV growth provides a better assessment of the company’s growth trajectory than revenue. The AVC growth rate of the company’s Pega Cloud offering is even more impressive at 25%. The company is switching customers from managing their software themselves (Client Cloud) to Pega managing it (Pega Cloud). This allows for higher margins as customers share the same cloud infrastructure, making it easier to deploy new features that the company can upsell. This ongoing shift helps create more value down the road for shareholders. Overall, Pega’s business is growing much faster now than it was in 2024. The company’s net new AVC adds hit $99 million in the first half of 2025, up 60% compared to H1 2024. So, what’s driving Pega to have all this success? Pega is making it known that its GenAI Blueprint tool is a key driver of success for the company. Blueprint allows users to describe a business problem in simple language, and within minutes, it generates a blueprint for an application that can solve it. Users can then refine this initial blueprint to better meet their needs, with minimal coding required. They can use it to enhance an existing company solution or develop a completely new one for a different problem. Overall, the tool aims to use GenAI to drastically reduce the time a company takes to build an application. That is a compelling proposition, as businesses need to evolve quickly in an ever-changing world. Pega’s sales teams use Blueprint themselves to show prospects customer-specific examples of how it can solve their problems in their first meeting. That makes it much easier for salespeople to secure more meetings and ultimately close the deal. This is why Pega says its growth reflects how “Pega GenAI Blueprint is transforming” its process of gaining customers. It notes that Blueprint is being talked about in every one of its sales campaigns. Pega believes Blueprint’s implementation of GenAI in the application design phase provides a key advantage over other agentic AI competitors. Analysts broadly raised their price targets on Pega after the Q2 results. The MarketBeat consensus price target on Pega is just under $58, nearly equal to the stock’s July 24 closing price. However, the average price target among analysts who updated their forecasts after the July 22 report is $65.60. That number implies around 13% upside in shares. This may not seem groundbreaking, but it is important to remember that the company is in the early stages of its Blueprint rollout. Given the product's success thus far, the longer-term upside opportunity for Pega is likely much larger. Pega notes that research firm Forrester NASDAQ: FORR estimates that two-thirds of global tech spending will go toward legacy systems in 2025. As Blueprint works to transform legacy systems, this shows the huge opportunity that Pega has to capture a percentage of this spending in the long term. GenAI Blueprint is now proving to be more than just a highly interesting product. It is clearly resonating with customers and driving growth for the company. This creates an opportunity for investors to gain a strong upside in Pegasystems' shares. Before you consider Pegasystems, you'll want to hear this.

Retail’s Comeback: 3 High-ROIC Stocks That Could Outshine AI,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/retails-comeback-3-high-roic-stocks-that-could-outshine-ai/,"It’s no secret that the retail sector is now one of the most forgotten areas of the market, whether it is because artificial intelligence (AI) names have taken the bulk of the attention—and capital—in the entire industry, or whether ongoing trade tariff negotiations have pushed investors away from this space in fear of further volatility and uncertainty. The truth is, there are some hidden opportunities with the potential to create the sort of wealth-compounding effects that every investor would love to have in their portfolio, especially considering how inflation and valuation uncertainty have affected the market and economy. Best Buy Inc. NYSE: BBY, Lululemon Athletica Inc. NASDAQ: LULU, and Bath & Body Works Inc. NYSE: BBWI are ideal candidates for multi-year runs and expansion in market capitalization. Why? They each boast strong profitability and the ability to reinvest earnings at high rates. Many consumers—and investors—would likely pass on Best Buy in favor of Amazon.com Inc. NASDAQ: AMZN and other online retailers that offer a wider selection of products and often better prices. Best Buy knows this, and it is one reason why it is quickly pivoting its inventory exposure to include items that customers wouldn’t usually buy online. The company hopes to capitalize on the value of an in-person with appliances, high-end electronics, and smart home devices that consumers want to see, touch, and understand before purchasing. In-store staff provide hands-on education, and showrooms allow consumers to test products, enhancing customer satisfaction and protecting pricing power and brand loyalty. This strategy should enable Best Buy to remain one of the few standing brick-and-mortar retailers still generating sufficient profits. The company's ROIC is hovering around 20%, well above the company’s cost of capital. This matters because annual stock price performance tends to align with the long-term ROIC rate over time, meaning there is sufficient market share and pricing power in the company’s brand to sustain business profitability for the foreseeable future. All this considered, Best Buy is positioned to continue delivering strong performance, especially as many of its peers struggle to adapt. Lululemon's story is one of short-term pain but long-term potential. After President Trump announced a wave of tariffs targeting most of the Asian countries from which the United States sources its apparel materials, Lululemon shares sold off significantly, trading at a dismal 53% of their 52-week high levels. This created a massive gap to be filled on the upside. While the headlines spooked retail investors, institutional sentiment tells a different story: the risk-to-reward ratio now favors the buyers. Over the past month, Lululemon’s short interest has declined by over 4%, showing some signs of bearish capitulation and a new path for higher prices. Major institutional investors have already taken action on this setup opportunity. For example, Robeco Institutional Asset Management significantly increased its holdings by as much as 55%, bringing its position to nearly $60 million. This aligns with Wall Street analysts issuing a consensus price target of $335.9 for LULU stock, implying the company can rally by as much as 50% from its current trading price. And that is not even assuming it will retest its previous 52-week highs. At the core of this buy-the-dip thesis is the company’s ROIC, which sits around 29%, confirming Lululemon's ability to maintain high margins and strong brand value, even during challenging macro periods. For long-term investors, the recent sell-off may be a gift. Wall Street analysts forecast that Bath & Body Works could generate up to $2.08 in earnings per share (EPS) for the fourth quarter of 2025, a massive jump from today’s reported 49-cent EPS. As most investors already know, stock price action typically follows EPS growth, but the story goes deeper than that. Bath & Body Works also generates up to 29.5% in ROIC, meaning that this brand recognition and market share could allow the company to compound on its value and deliver outsized returns, following the Best Buy model of capitalizing on the in-person shopping experience. Bath & Body Works thrives on sensory-based shopping, selling products customers want to see, smell, and feel before buying. The brand has cultivated deep consumer loyalty and continues to drive innovation in fragrance, skincare, and home products. Institutional buyers have taken note, with OLD National Bancorp recently boosting its stake by 8.5%, bringing its total holding to over $11 million. This quiet vote of confidence is worth paying attention to, especially with the stock trading at relatively low multiples compared to its historical averages. In addition, the recent appointment of Daniel Heaf, a former Nike executive, as CEO further signals a shift toward operational excellence and modern retail strategy and could drive future profitability even higher.

Homebuilding Headwinds Putting These 3 Stocks Under Pressure,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/homebuilding-headwinds-putting-these-3-stocks-under-pressure/,"The S&P 500 has experienced a broad rally over the last three months, but not every sector has participated in the uptrend. In fact, some sectors have been struggling in the face of stiff headwinds from regulators and macroenvironmental factors. Homebuilders have yet to join the market rally because the housing market remains stifled by high mortgage rates, rising construction costs, and a price growth contagion emanating out of previously hot markets. Today, we’ll examine the myriad factors putting pressure on housing stocks and three companies investors might want to avoid while their margins are being threatened. You might have read that last section and thought, “Well, other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how was the play?” However, homebuilder headwinds continue to intensify as consumers expect high prices and elevated mortgage rates to persist longer than initially anticipated. D.R. Horton Inc. NYSE: DHI boosted the sector this week by beating top and bottom line earnings expectations, but the numbers still shrank year over year, and this brief bump could be a good exit point for the following three companies. NVR Inc. NYSE: NVR comprises three brands: Ryan Homes, NVHomes, and Heartland Homes, which focus on detached homes, condominiums, and townhouses. It operates in 18 states, including the Midwest and Southeast, where prices have recently shown weakness. It also has a significant presence in D.C., which experienced a slowdown in June. NVR runs an asset-light business model by outsourcing land development, but it also remains at the mercy of developers passing on tariffs. New immigration restrictions will also affect NVR’s subcontractors, and the company will likely need to increase wages to compensate. NVR posted a significant EPS miss in its Q1 2025 earnings report, and analysts are expecting more YOY declines in this week’s Q2 report. Lennar Corp. NYSE: LEN focuses on a high-volume operation, which leaves it vulnerable to macro and regulatory pressures. Since Lennar’s strategy requires a high number of homes to be built and sold each year, any type of disruption can severely hurt margins and cause a cascade of delays. Tariffs can be especially damaging to high-volume sellers like Lennar, as the company‘s ability to fully pass these costs onto buyers is limited by splintered demand. LEN shares soared 8% following the DHI earnings release, but this sympathy rally could be short-lived as Lennar’s Q2 earnings report showed a 4.4% drop in YOY revenue, and the stock is still down nearly 13% in 2025. KB Home Inc. NYSE: KBH specializes in land development and housing for first-time buyers or first-time move-up buyers, which is, unfortunately, the customer base most likely to feel the sting from high prices and mortgage rates. The company’s Built To Order strategy offers unique customization and a personalized experience; however, this model may struggle with the HAI under 100, as customization matters less to buyers than affordability. KBH has also already reported Q2 earnings, and saw revenue drop an eye-popping 10.5% YOY. Several analysts dropped their price targets following the June release, including Wells Fargo and Barclays, which cut their price estimates below the current market price.

Passengers flee smoking jet on emergency slide after apparent landing gear problem at Denver airport,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/passengers-flee-smoking-jet-on-emergency-slide-after-apparent-landing-gear-problem-at-denver-airport-2025-07-27/,"Passengers slid down an emergency slide of a smoking jet at Denver International Airport due to a possible problem with the plane's landing gear, authorities said. American Airlines Flight 3023 reported a “possible landing gear incident” during its departure from Denver on Saturday afternoon, the Federal Aviation Administration said. The problem involved an aircraft tire, the Fort Worth, Texas-based airline said in a statement. The Boeing 737 MAX 8 carrying 173 passengers and six crew members was on its way to Miami International Airport, American said. Video aired by local media showed people sliding down the inflatable chute near the front of the plane while clutching luggage and small children. Some passengers, including at least one adult carrying a young child, tripped at the end of the slide and fell onto the concrete runway. Passengers were then taken to the terminal by bus. Shay Armistead, a 17-year-old from Minturn, Colorado, described a chaotic scene. After hearing a loud “boom,” the plane “started to violently shake and we were drifting to the left side of the runway,” Armistead told The Associated Press in an interview. Armistead and her teammates on a ski racing team were on their way from Colorado to Chile when it happened. “I started grabbing my friend’s hands, I was like ‘Oh my God,’ and then they slammed on the brakes, and we all like went forward and they finally brought the plane to a stop,” she said. “It was just terrifying.” One of the passengers was taken to a hospital with a minor injury, American Airlines said in its statement. Five people were evaluated for injuries at the scene but did not require hospitalization, airport officials said. “About halfway to takeoff speed, we hear a big bang and a pop,” passenger Shaun Williams told KUSA-TV. “The pilot immediately started abort procedures for taking off. You could feel him start to hit the brakes.” Firefighters extinguished a fire on the aircraft, the Denver Fire Department said. “All customers and crew deplaned safely, and the aircraft was taken out of service to be inspected by our maintenance team,” American said. In a statement, the FAA said it's investigating. Armistead said she's thankful for everyone who helped her and the other passengers, and grateful that she's safe. “You've just got to appreciate what you're given, and I'm so grateful that it wasn't worse,"" Armistead said. ___ This story corrects the spelling of a passenger’s name.

Here's how a major Mexican tomato exporter is affected by Trump’s 17% tariff,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/heres-how-a-major-mexican-tomato-exporter-is-affected-by-trumps-17-tariff-2025-07-26/,"AJUCHITLAN, Mexico (AP) — The Trump administration’s decision to impose a 17% duty on fresh tomatoes imported from Mexico has created a dilemma for the country providing more tomatoes to U.S. consumers than any other. The import tax that began July 14 is just the latest protectionist move by an administration that has threatened dozens of countries with tariffs, including its critical trading partner Mexico. It comes as the Mexican government tries to also negotiate its way out of a 30% general tariff scheduled to take effect Aug. 1. While the impacts of the tomato tariff are still in their infancy, a major grower and exporter in central Mexico shows how a tariff targeting a single product can destabilize the sector. Green tomato plants stretch upward row after row in sprawling high-tech greenhouses covering nearly six acres in the central state of Queretaro, among the top 10 tomato producing states in Mexico. Climate controlled and pest free, Veggie Prime’s greenhouses in Ajuchitlan send some 100 tons of fresh tomatoes every week to Mastronardi Produce. The Canadian company is the leading distributor of fresh tomatoes in the U.S. with clients that include Costco and Walmart. Moisés Atri, Veggie Prime’s export director, says they’ve been exporting tomatoes to the U.S. for 13 years and their substantial investment and the cost to produce their tomatoes won’t allow them to make any immediate changes. They’re also contractually obligated to sell everything they produce to Mastronardi until 2026. “None of us (producers) can afford it,"" Atri said. ""We have to approach our client to adjust the prices because we’re nowhere near making that kind of profit.” In the tariff’s first week, Veggie Prime ate the entire charge. In the second, its share of the new cost lowered when its client agreed to increase the price of their tomatoes by 10%. The 56-year-old Atri hopes that Mastronardi will eventually pass all of the tariff’s cost onto its retail clients. Experts say the tariff could cause a 5% to 10% drop in tomato exports, which last year amounted to more than $3 billion for Mexico. The Mexican Association of Tomato Producers says the industry generates some 500,000 jobs. Juan Carlos Anaya, director general of the consulting firm Grupo Consultor de Mercados Agrícolas, said a drop in tomato exports, which last year amounted to more than 2 billion tons, could lead to the loss of some 200,000 jobs When the Trump administration announced the tariff, the Commerce Department justified it as a measure to protect U.S. producers from artificially cheap Mexican imports. California and Florida growers that produce about 11 million tons would stand to benefit most, though most of that production is for processed tomatoes. Experts believe the U.S. would find it difficult to replace Mexico’s fresh tomato imports. Atri and other producers are waiting for a scheduled review of the measure in two months, when the U.S. heads into fall and fresh tomato production there begins to decline. In reaction to the tariff, the Mexican government has floated the idea of looking for other, more stable, international markets. Mexican Agriculture Secretary Julio Berdegué said Thursday that the government is looking at possibilities like Japan, but producers quickly cast doubt on that idea, noting the tomatoes would have to be sent by plane, raising the cost even more. Atri said the company is starting to experiment with peppers, to see if they would provide an option at scale. President Claudia Sheinbaum said recently her administration would survey tomato growers to figure out what support they need, especially small producers who are already feeling the effects of a drop of more than 10% in the price of tomatoes domestically over fears there will be a glut in Mexico.

US-EU deal sets a 15% tariff on most goods and averts the threat of a trade war with a global shock,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trumps-meeting-with-a-key-european-official-comes-as-his-tariff-deadline-nears-2025-07-26/,"EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) — The United States and the European Union agreed on Sunday to a trade framework setting a 15% tariff on most goods, staving off — at least for now — far higher import duties on both sides that might have sent shock waves through economies around the globe. The sweeping announcement came after President Donald Trump and European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen met briefly at Trump's Turnberry golf course in Scotland. Their private sit-down culminated months of bargaining, with the White House deadline Friday nearing for imposing punishing tariffs on the EU's 27 member countries. “It was a very interesting negotiation. I think it’s going to be great for both parties,” Trump said. The agreement, he said, was “a good deal for everybody” and “a giant deal with lots of countries.” Von der Leyen said the deal “will bring stability, it will bring predictability, that’s very important for our businesses on both sides of the Atlantic.” As with other, recent tariff agreements that Trump announced with countries including Japan and the United Kingdom, some major details remain pending in this one. Trump said the EU had agreed to buy some $750 billion worth of U.S. energy and invest $600 billion more than it already is in America — as well as make a major military equipment purchase. He said tariffs “for automobiles and everything else will be a straight across tariff of 15%” and meant that U.S. exporters ”have the opening up of all of the European countries.” Von der Leyen said the 15% tariffs were “across the board, all inclusive” and that “indeed, basically the European market is open.” At a later news conference away from Turnberry, she said the $750 billion in additional U.S. energy purchases was actually over the next three years — and would help ease the dependence on natural gas from Russia among the bloc’s countries. “When the European Union and the United States work together as partners, the benefits are tangible,” Von der Leyen said, noting that the agreement “stabilized on a single, 15% tariff rate for the vast majority of EU exports"" including cars, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals. “15% is a clear ceiling,” she said. But von der Leyen also clarified that such a rate wouldn’t apply to everything, saying that both sides agreed on “zero for zero tariffs on a number of strategic products,” like all aircraft and component parts, certain chemicals, certain generic drugs, semiconductor equipment, some agricultural products, natural resources and critical raw materials. It is unclear if alcohol will be included in that list. “And we will keep working to add more products to this list,” she said, while also stressing that the “framework means the figures we have just explained to the public, but, of course, details have to be sorted out. And that will happen over the next weeks.” In the meantime, there will be work to do on other fronts. Von der Leyen had a mandate to negotiate because the European Commission handles trade for member countries. But the Commission must now present the deal to member states and EU lawmakers, who will ultimately decide whether or not to approve it. Before their meeting began, Trump pledged to change what he characterized as “a very one-sided transaction, very unfair to the United States.” ""I think both sides want to see fairness,” the Republican president told reporters. Von der Leyen said the U.S. and EU combined have the world's largest trade volume, encompassing hundreds of millions of people and trillions of dollars and added that Trump was “known as a tough negotiator and dealmaker."" “But fair,” Trump said. Trump has spent months threatening most of the world with large tariffs in hopes of shrinking major U.S. trade deficits with many key trading partners. More recently, he had hinted that any deal with the EU would have to “buy down” a tariff rate of 30% that had been set to take effect. But during his comments before the agreement was announced, the president was asked if he'd be willing to accept tariff rates lower than 15%, and he said “no.” Their meeting came after Trump played golf for the second straight day at Turnberry, this time with a group that included sons Eric and Donald Jr. In addition to negotiating deals, Trump's five-day visit to Scotland is built around golf and promoting properties bearing his name. A small group of demonstrators at the course waved American flags and raised a sign criticizing British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who plans his own Turnberry meeting with Trump on Monday. Other voices could be heard cheering and chanting “Trump! Trump!” as he played nearby. On Tuesday, Trump will be in Aberdeen, in northeastern Scotland, where his family has another golf course and is opening a third next month. The president and his sons plan to help cut the ribbon on the new course. The U.S. and EU seemed close to a deal earlier this month, but Trump instead threatened the 30% tariff rate. The deadline for the Trump administration to begin imposing tariffs has shifted in recent weeks but is now firm and coming Friday, the administration insists. “No extensions, no more grace periods. Aug. 1, the tariffs are set, they’ll go into place, Customs will start collecting the money and off we go,"" U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told “Fox News Sunday"" before the EU deal was announced. He added, however, that even after that “people can still talk to President Trump. I mean, he’s always willing to listen.” Without an agreement, the EU said it was prepared to retaliate with tariffs on hundreds of American products, ranging from beef and auto parts to beer and Boeing airplanes. If Trump eventually followed through on his threat of tariffs against Europe, meanwhile, it could have made everything from French cheese and Italian leather goods to German electronics and Spanish pharmaceuticals more expensive in the United States. “I think it’s great that we made a deal today, instead of playing games and maybe not making a deal at all,” Trump said. “I think it’s the biggest deal ever made.” ___ Associated Press writers Seung Min Kim in Cincinnati and Samuel Petrequin in London contributed to this report.

Allianz Life confirms data breach affecting majority of 1.4M US customers,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/allianz-life-confirms-data-breach-affecting-majority-of-14m-us-customers-2025-07-26/,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Hackers gained access to personal data on the majority of the 1.4 million customers of Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America, the company confirmed Saturday. Minneapolis-based Allianz Life, a subsidiary of Munich, Germany-based Allianz SE, said the data breach happened on July 16 when a “malicious threat actor” gained access to a third-party, cloud-based system used by the company. “The threat actor was able to obtain personally identifiable data related to the majority of Allianz Life’s customers, financial professionals, and select Allianz Life employees, using a social engineering technique,” Allianz Life said in a statement. ""We took immediate action to contain and mitigate the issue and notified the FBI."" The company said its own systems were not accessed, just the third-party's platform. Allianz Life said its investigation is ongoing and that the company has begun reaching out to the impacted individuals. It said the incident involves only Allianz Life in the U.S., not other Allianz corporate entities. In the case of data breaches, a “social engineering technique” usually involves using trickery to gain access. Spokesman Brett Weinberg said he couldn't provide details because they are still investigating. Allianz Life also reported the breach to multiple other authorities, including the Maine Attorney General's Office. A filing on the agency's website said the company discovered the breach the day after it happened, and that it will be offering those affected 24 months of identity theft protection and credit monitoring. Allianz Life was known as North American Life and Casualty until it was acquired by German conglomerate Allianz SE in 1979 and changed its name to Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America. It has nearly 2,000 employees in U.S., with the majority working in Minnesota, according to its website. It is one of five North American subsidiaries of the Munich-based global financial services group Allianz SE, which says it serves more than 125 million customers worldwide.

The Tea app was intended to help women date safely. Then it got hacked,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/the-tea-app-was-intended-to-help-women-date-safely-then-it-got-hacked-2025-07-26/,"Tea, a provocative dating app designed to let women anonymously ask or warn each other about men they'd encountered, rocketed to the top spot on the U.S. Apple App Store this week. On Friday, the company behind the app confirmed it had been hacked: Thousands of images, including selfies, were leaked online. “We have engaged third-party cybersecurity experts and are working around the clock to secure our systems,” San Francisco-based Tea Dating Advice Inc. said in a statement. 404 Media, which earlier reported the breach, said it was 4Chan users who discovered an exposed database that “allowed anyone to access the material” from Tea. The app and the breach highlight the fraught nature of seeking romance in the age of social media. Here's what to know: Tea founder Sean Cook, a software engineer who previously worked at Salesforce and Shutterfly, says on the app's website that he founded the company in 2022 after witnessing his own mother's “terrifying'' experiences. Cook said they included unknowingly dating men with criminal records and being ”catfished'' — deceived by men using false identities. Tea markets itself as a safe way for women to anonymously vet men they might meet on dating apps such as Tinder or Bumble — ensuring that the men are who they say they are, not criminals and not already married or in a relationship. ""It's like people have their own little Yelp pages,'' said Aaron Minc, whose Cleveland firm, Minc Law, specializes in cases involving online defamation and harassment. In an Apple Store review, one woman wrote that she used a Tea search to investigate a man she'd begun talking to and discovered “over 20 red flags, including serious allegations like assault and recording women without their consent.'' She said she cut off communication. ”I can't imagine how things could've gone had I not known,"" she wrote. A surge in social media attention over the past week pushed Tea to the No. 1 spot on Apple's U.S. App Store as of July 24, according to Sensor Tower, a research firm. In the seven days from July 17-23, Tea downloads shot up 525% compared to the week before. Tea said in an Instagram post that it had reached 4 million users. A female columnist for The Times of London newspaper, who signed into the app, on Thursday called Tea a “man-shaming site'' and complained that ”this is simply vigilante justice, entirely reliant on the scruples of anonymous women. With Tea on the scene, what man would ever dare date a woman again?'' “Over the last couple of weeks, we’ve gotten hundreds of calls on it. It’s blown up,” attorney Minc said. ""People are upset. They're getting named. They’re getting shamed.’’ In 1996, Congress passed legislation protecting websites and apps from liability for things posted by their users. But the users can be sued for spreading ”false and defamatory'' information, Minc said. In May, however, a federal judge in Illinois threw out an invasion-of-privacy lawsuit by a man who’d been criticized by women in the Facebook chat group “Are We Dating the Same Guy,″ Bloomberg Law reported. State privacy laws could offer another avenue for bringing legal action against someone who posted your photograph or other personal information in a harmful way, Minc said. In its statement, Tea reported that about 72,000 images were leaked online, including 13,000 images of selfies or photo identification that users submitted during account verification. Another 59,000 images that were publicly viewable in the app from posts, comments and direct messages were also accessed, according to the company's statement. No email addresses or phone numbers were exposed, the company said, and the breach only affects users who signed up before February 2024. “At this time, there is no evidence to suggest that additional user data was affected. Protecting tea users’ privacy and data is our highest priority,” Tea said. It said users did not need to change their passwords or delete their accounts. ""All data has been secured.'' Lawyer Minc said he was not surprised to see Tea get targeted. “These sites get attacked,'' he said. ”They create enemies. They put targets on themselves where people want to go after them.'' .

"Comic-Con salutes James Gunn and gets first looks at 'Coyote vs. Acme,' and new 'Star Trek' forays",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/comic-con-goes-interstellar-with-project-hail-mary-star-trek-updates-2025-07-26/,"SAN DIEGO (AP) — Director James Gunn got an ovation from thousands for “Superman” in the most fitting place of all — Comic-Con. Among the highlights of day three of the San Diego pop culture spectacular was a sincere tribute to the director who's now helming Warner Bros.' DC Comics screen universe, even if John Cena played it for laughs. It came at a panel on the forthcoming Season 2 of DC's HBO series “The Peacemaker,” and Cena appeared in the title character's full comic costume and grand helmet, leading the legions in the kind of exaggerated drama he was perfect at provoking in his wrestling days. It was Gunn's first time in front of a crowd in the weeks since “Superman” was released and has earned more than $200 million in North America. “Today has been the most fun day I’ve had in a year,"" Gunn told the crowd at the end of the session. “Superman” was his first film as captain of the DC ship, but his first foray was in 2021's “The Suicide Squad,” which spawned the “Peacemaker” TV series. The crowd saw scenes from Season 2, which arrives in August and sees Cena entering another dimension where he gets to be a cool version of the hero instead of the often pained and pathetic version that's typical of the character. Some characters from “Superman” will make appearances. That panel followed another rousing showcase in Hall H, where star Ryan Gosling and directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller showed scenes from their forthcoming science-comedy space adventure “Project Hail Mary.” The scenes from the film set for release in March included a look at Rocky, a faceless, stone-shaped alien who becomes Gosling's unlikely partner in an attempt to save the universe from ecological disaster. Wile E. Coyote is getting his day in court — and theaters. The stars of “Coyote vs. Acme” delivered a rousing presentation Saturday morning of a movie that at one point wasn’t going to be released but is now bound for theaters in August 2026. The underdog story – both of the movie and Coyote — was a running theme of the panel. But rather than direct ire at Warner Bros., the real-world studio that shelved the project, the panel focused on the fictional Acme Corp. “This is purely an Acme decision … and I am saying this for legal purposes,” moderator Paul Scheer said at the start of the panel. The movie is a hybrid of animation and live action and is based on a 1990 New Yorker article that satirized a legal complaint filed by Coyote against Acme, the maker of the TNT, detonators, rocket shoes, catapults and other products that consistently backfire during the Coyote’s fruitless attempts to catch the Roadrunner. Laughter filled Hall H as some 6,000 watched a montage of Coyote being blown up, flattened and falling into chasms in a scene set to Johnny Cash’s cover of “Hurt.” Coyote is replaying the moments in his lair when an ad for a personal injury lawyer appears on TV. They also played six minutes of the movie, including a scene of opening statements in the case in which Coyote's lawyer, Will Forte, accidentally unleashes a rocket skate into the courtroom, setting Coyote and the judge's robes on fire. Cena plays a slick Acme lawyer who wins over the jury, which includes a cartoon character, quickly. Forte said he didn't think the movie would ever get to audiences. “I’m pretty speechless. You think back to the journey that this movie has taken. I had kind of given up hope at a certain point,” Forte said. At one point, his comments were interrupted by a man playing an Acme lawyer who stormed into Hall H with cease-and-desist letters. Director Dave Green said the movie conforms to famed animator Chuck Jones’ rules for the struggle between the Coyote and Roadrunner, which include the bird always staying on the road and the Coyote being ultimately more humiliated than hurt when he falls, is crushed or gets blown up by TNT. The movie, which features cameos from numerous Looney Tunes characters like Foghorn Leghorn, Tweety and Bugs Bunny, will be released on Aug. 28, 2026. Ketchup Entertainment teamed up with Warner Bros. on the film and in the release of “The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie.” Also on Saturday morning, the cast of “Bad Guys 2” teasing new footage from the movie and describing how they recorded their characters. Marc Maron, who plays Snake, joked he asked to be tied up as he performed his lines on the floor. “The depth of the character should read a little more this time,” he said. The film, based on the graphic novel series by Aaron Blabey, introduces a new crew of animal criminals, the Bad Girls played by Danielle Brooks, Natasha Lyonne and Maria Bakalova. Paramount showed off its first footage from a new series, “Starfleet Academy,” which stars Holly Hunter and Paul Giamatti. The show follows cadets as they go through training, with Hunter serving as chancellor of the academy. It will arrive in 2026, the 60th anniversary year of the original “Star Trek” series. Paramount+'s other “Star Trek” series, “Strange New Worlds,” also shared updates. The crew of the USS Enterprise are being turned into puppets for an upcoming “Strange New Worlds” episode, Paramount announced Saturday. The puppets will be created by Jim Henson's Creature Shop. Season 3, which follows the adventures of the Enterprise under the command of Capt. Christopher Pike, is being released on Paramount+. An estimated 135,000 people — many in costumes — are expected to attend Comic-Con 2025, which runs through Sunday in downtown San Diego. So far, fans have gotten previews of “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2,”the upcoming FX series “Alien: Earth,”“Tron: Ares” and “Predator: Badlands,” which will be in theaters in November.

Trump says Japan will invest $550 billion in US at his direction. It may not be a sure thing,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-says-japan-will-invest-550-billion-in-us-at-his-direction-it-may-not-be-a-sure-thing-2025-07-26/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is bragging that Japan has given him, as part of a new trade framework, $550 billion to invest in the United States. It's an astonishing figure, but still subject to negotiation and perhaps not the sure thing he's portraying. ""Japan is putting up $550 billion in order to lower their tariffs a little bit,"" Trump said Thursday. “They put up, as you could call it, seed money. Let’s call it seed money.” He said 90% of any profits from the money invested would go to the U.S. even if Japan had put up the funds. “It’s not a loan or anything, it’s a signing bonus,” the Republican president said, on the trade framework that lowered his threatened tariff from 25% to 15%, including on autos. A White House official said the terms are being negotiated and nothing has been formalized in writing. The official, who insisted on anonymity to detail the terms of the talks, suggested the goal was for the $550 billion fund to make investments at Trump's direction. The sum is significant: It would represent more than 10% of Japan's entire gross domestic product. The Japan External Trade Organization estimates that direct investment into the U.S. economy topped $780 billion in 2023. It is unclear the degree to which the $550 billion could represent new investment or flow into existing investment plans. What the trade framework announced Tuesday has achieved is a major talking point for the Trump administration. The president has claimed to have brought trillions of dollars in new investment into the U.S., though the impact of those commitments have yet to appear in the economic data for jobs, construction spending or manufacturing output. The framework also enabled Trump to say other countries are agreeing to have their goods taxed, even if some of the cost of those taxes are ultimately passed along to U.S. consumers. On the $550 billion, Japan's Cabinet Office said it involves the credit facility of state-affiliated financial institutions, such as Japan Bank for International Cooperation. Further details would be decided based on the progress of the investment deals. Japanese trade negotiator Ryosei Akazawa, upon returning to Japan, did not discuss the terms of the $550 billion investment. Akazawa said he believes a written joint statement is necessary, at least on working levels, to avoid differences. He is not thinking about a legally binding trade pact. The U.S. apparently released its version of the deal while Japanese officials were on their return flight home. “If we find differences of understanding, we may have to point them out and say ‘that’s not what we discussed,’” Akazawa said. The U.S. administration said the fund would be invested in critical minerals, pharmaceuticals, computer chips and shipbuilding, among other industries. It has said Japan will also buy 100 airplanes from Boeing and rice from U.S. farmers as part of the framework, which Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said would be evaluated every three months. “And if the president is unhappy, then they will boomerang back to the 25% tariff rates, both on cars and the rest of their products. And I can tell you that I think at 25, especially in cars, the Japanese economy doesn’t work,” Bessent told Fox News' “The Ingraham Angle.” Akazawa denied that Bessent’s quarterly review was part of the negotiations. “In my past eight trips to the United States during which I held talks with the president and the ministers,"" Akazawa said. “I have no recollection of discussing how we ensure the implementation of the latest agreement between Japan and the United States.” He said it would cause major disruptions to the economy and administrative processes if the rates first rise to 25% as scheduled on Aug. 1 and then drop to 15%. “We definitely want to avoid that and I believe that is the understanding shared by the U.S. side,” he said. On buying U.S. rice, Japanese officials have said they have no plans to raise the current 770,000-ton “minimum access” cap to import more from America. Agricultural Minister Shinjiro Koizumi said Japan will decide whether to increase U.S. rice imports and that Japan is not committed to a fixed quota. Trump's commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, has suggested that the Japanese agreement is putting pressure on other countries such as South Korea to strike deals with the U.S. Trump, who is traveling in Scotland, plans to meet on Sundayv with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to discuss trade. “Whatever Donald Trump wants to build, the Japanese will finance it for him,” Lutnick said Thursday on CNBC. “Pretty amazing.” ___ Yamaguchi reported from Tokyo.

"Modi joins Maldives independence day celebrations, signals easing tensions amid China rivalry",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/modi-joins-maldives-independence-day-celebrations-signals-easing-tensions-amid-china-rivalry-2025-07-26/,"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi Saturday participated Saturday in the 60th Independence Day celebrations of the Maldives, concluding a two-day visit to the island nation. During the trip, Modi also announced financial assistance and formally launched talks on a proposed free trade agreement. The two-day visit was seen as crucial to India’s ambition to control the seas and shipping routes of the Indian Ocean in a race with its regional rival China. It signaled a thaw in diplomatic tensions that followed the election of pro-China Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu in 2023. Modi joined a distinguished gathering at Republic Square in the capital, Malé, where a military parade and cultural performances marked the anniversary of the Maldives gaining independence from British rule in 1965. On Friday, following talks with Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu, Modi announced a credit line of $565 million to support development projects in the Maldives. The visit coincided with the anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between the two nations in 1965. It also saw the start of talks on a free trade agreement. The two leaders oversaw the exchange of signed agreements to cooperate in sectors such as fisheries, health, tourism and digital development. Modi also handed over dozens of heavy vehicles donated by India to strengthen the Maldives’ defense forces. The Maldives — an archipelago nation strategically located in the Indian Ocean — is a focal point in the growing geopolitical rivalry between India and China. Tensions grew when Muizzu, who favored closer ties with China, was elected in 2023 after defeating the India-friendly incumbent Ibrahim Mohamed Solih. Leading up to the election, Muizzu had promised to expel Indian soldiers deployed in the Maldives to help with humanitarian assistance. Last year New Delhi replaced dozens of its soldiers in the Maldives with civilian experts. Measures by Modi to promote tourism in India’s Lakshadweep archipelago, off the southwestern coast of the Indian mainland, also sparked anger from Maldivians, who saw it as a move to lure Indian tourists away from their country. Indian celebrities then called for a tourism boycott of the Maldives. Tensions escalated last year when President Muizzu visited China before India, a move widely interpreted in New Delhi as a diplomatic snub. On his return, Muizzu outlined plans to reduce the Maldives’ reliance on India for medical services, pharmaceuticals, and essential imports such as food staples. Relations started to improve after Muizzu attended Modi’s swearing-in ceremony for a third five-year term last year. Muizzu has since toned down his anti-Indian rhetoric, and official contacts with New Delhi have intensified amid growing concern about the Maldives’ economy. During a visit by Muizzu to India last October, India pledged financial support to the Maldives, which has been struggling with debt. This included $100 million in short-term government loans and agreeing to a $400 million currency swap to help stabilize the Maldivian economy. India has long been a key development partner for the Maldives. However, the island nation has also deepened ties with China, joining its Belt and Road Initiative in 2013 to build infrastructure and expand trade — part of Beijing’s broader effort to increase its global influence.

Crypto Skeptics Can Still Win Big With These Risk-Limiting ETFs,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/crypto-skeptics-can-still-win-big-with-these-risk-limiting-etfs/,"Fresh off all-time highs above $120,000, Bitcoin has had an incredible run in the last year with a price increase above 80%. The potential for a more favorable regulatory environment may have helped drive these gains and could also inspire once-cautious investors to take the crypto plunge. Still, there are plenty of reasons to be hesitant about cryptocurrency—volatility, user and programming risks for various exchanges and platforms, and security concerns are all still present, among other things. Investors hesitant to make direct, unprotected cryptocurrency investments but interested in the recent rally might consider a risk-limiting crypto ETF. Besides providing some insulation from the cryptocurrency itself by allowing exposure indirectly through shares of a fund, these vehicles may combine a crypto focus with something more stable from the traditional investment landscape. Further, all of the funds below have significantly outperformed the S&P 500 year-to-date (YTD), showing that these risk-mitigating strategies can still pay off. The Fidelity Crypto Industry and Digital Payments ETF NASDAQ: FDIG has been one of the better-performing crypto-adjacent ETFs in recent quarters. FDIG does not invest in cryptocurrency or related futures but rather holds a basket of stocks from both the U.S. and international markets. While many of these companies are involved in the cryptocurrency space—think of crypto exchanges like Coinbase Global Inc. NASDAQ: COIN and digital asset miners like MARA Holdings Inc. NASDAQ: MARA—others are more broadly centered around digital payments or blockchain, providing some alternate exposure. FDIG is reasonably diversified, with around 52 separate holdings that are spaced across the small-, mid-, and large-cap categories. Coinbase is the single largest security holding, but most other names are fairly evenly weighted. FDIG may appeal for its passive income potential, as it provides a dividend yield of 0.95%. This may help make the expense ratio of 0.40% even more compelling, despite the fact that it's already lower than many other crypto funds. FDIG has returned about 24% YTD, ahead of the S&P 500's 8.7% over the same period. An Ethereum-focused fund, the Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF NYSEARCA: AETH, aims to minimize the impact of volatility by using U.S. Treasuries during volatile periods. AETH is an actively managed fund that pivots between two different approaches: when fund managers believe momentum is strong, AETH holds exclusively CME Ether Futures, and when the market becomes volatile or uncertain, AETH shifts entirely to U.S. Treasuries. The fund's provider, Bitwise, asserts that a rotational strategy like this can outperform buy-and-hold crypto funds by capturing gains achieved during ether rallies while limiting downside risk during turbulent times. AETH's recent performance would suggest that this is accurate; the fund has a YTD return of 32.6%, while a traditional competitor investing solely in ether futures like the ARK 21Shares Active Ethereum Futures Strategy ETF NYSEARCA: ARKZ has returned just 7.7% in the same period. Investors should expect to spend more in fees for the active management component of AETH, which charges an expense ratio of 0.89%. ARKZ, by contrast, is somewhat lower at 0.70%. However, the added security of a Treasuries component—and the improved performance—may make AETH worth the higher cost. The One+One Bitcoin and Ether ETF NASDAQ: OOQB is a unique type of leveraged investment that offers both 100% Nasdaq-100 exposure and 100% Bitcoin exposure via futures. As a leveraged play, investors may wish to focus on short-term trades of OOQB. This fund provides an interesting mix of risk and risk mitigation. On one hand, a 2x leverage such as this is inherently higher-risk than traditional, non-leveraged ETFs. However, by balancing out Bitcoin futures exposure, typically seen as higher risk than traditional index-based funds, with a group of stalwart performers like those from the Nasdaq-100, OOQB offers some protection relative to a pure-play Bitcoin investment. OOQB is one of the newest cryptocurrency ETFs available, having only launched in February 2025. As such, a YTD performance metric is unavailable for this fund. However, in the last three months, it has returned more than 50%, with a relatively modest expense ratio of 0.85%. Keep in mind, though, as above, that the fund may not be intended for buy-and-hold investors but rather for those seeking targeted short-term exposure to Bitcoin with some protection from synchronous Nasdaq-100 access.

3 Discounted Steel Stocks You Can DCA Into Today,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/3-discounted-steel-stocks-you-can-dca-into-today/,"Most investors can agree that the industrial sector's current state is one of neglect, as most of the attention (and capital) has shifted to the more exciting stories in the artificial intelligence race in today’s market. This means that a potential rotation could be triggered in the future, no matter how vague this future may be. One of the best ways for investors to start exposing their portfolios to setups like these is to implement something called dollar-cost averaging (DCA). This means that investors will choose both a set date and amount to invest in a single name or a basket of names in an area like the industrial sector, which shows significant upside potential and a gap to fill. Of course, choosing the best names in this area can significantly improve the results of a DCA strategy, which is where names like Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. NYSE: CLF, Commercial Metals Co. NYSE: CMC, and even Steel Dynamics Inc. NASDAQ: STLD come into play. There are obvious reasons why investors should consider these stocks for their DCA basket, as they could offer the best of both safety and upside potential in the coming months. Considering the entire steel industry, all peers are trading at an average of 90% of their 52-week high prices. This is why Cleveland-Cliffs stock should be viewed as a potential catch-up play, as it is currently the outlier, trading at only 68% of its 52-week high. Next is the recently bullish view coming out of Wall Street, where Phillip Gibbs, an analyst from KeyCorp, decided to boost his rating on Cleveland-Cliffs stock from Sector Weight to Overweight. Not only did the sentiment improve for this stock, but its current perceived valuation also improved. This analyst decided to stand out of the pack and place a $14 per share price target on Cleveland-Cliffs stock, which, compared to today’s prices would mean not only flirting with 52-week high levels and closing that gap to peers, but also an approximate 40% upside potential for investors to expose their portfolios to in a DCA strategy. Another gauge to justify this view for Cleveland-Cliffs stock can be taken from what institutional buyers are doing with it. As of late July 2025, those from JB Capital decided to boost their holdings in the stock by 14.6% to net their position at $1.2 million. The fact that this isn’t the largest holding speaks to the current interest in slowly building a bigger position through DCA. Commercial Metals stock stands out due to its exposure to aluminum and steel production in the United States and China. This makes it an immediately valuable business opportunity that diversifies the ongoing risks and uncertainties stemming from the trade tariff negotiations between the two countries. Investors can expect big things from this fundamental setup, especially as Wall Street analysts now see the company reporting up to $1.25 in earnings per share (EPS) for the fourth quarter of 2025, in other words, a net increase of 70% from today’s reported $0.74 EPS. Now, most investors know that where EPS growth goes, so does the stock price, and this is why the entire market is now willing to pay up to 167.3x the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, a significant premium compared to the 109.3x average P/E for the materials sector today. Markets are often willing to overpay for names that they expect will outperform not only their peers but also the broader market. Commercial Metals stock's massive EPS growth and diversification between the United States and China justify a premium. As of mid-July 2025, Wall Street analysts seem to have figured out that Steel Dynamics stock is one of the clear winners in the steel industry. This might be why an analyst like Bill Peterson from J.P. Morgan Chase decided to boost his valuation target from $138 per share to a much higher $150 valuation. This new view implies that the stock could deliver up to 20% upside moves in the coming months and quarters, but like others, this one is also justified. Wall Street analysts also anticipate significant EPS growth in the coming quarters, with a target of $2.88 for the fourth quarter of 2025. Compared to today’s reported $2.01 in EPS, this suggests investors could be positioned for a 43% growth rate in earnings, which supports the double-digit upside potential seen in these valuation targets as well. This would make it another perfect candidate for starting a DCA strategy today for the coming quarters. Just as in the other names on this list, smart money has already started to apply this strategy, as those from Robeco Institutional Asset Management boosted their position in Steel Dynamics stock by 40.6% as of mid-July 2025 for a net holding of $214.5 million today, and another vote of confidence for this winner.

Could Baker Hughes Be an Unlikely Winner in Drone Defense Boom?,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/could-baker-hughes-be-an-unlikely-winner-in-drone-defense-boom/,"Baker Hughes NASDAQ: BKR won't be a name that comes to mind in the context of rising global defense budgets. However, the company’s recent earnings report shows why Baker Hughes may have an unrealized advantage as energy infrastructure, digital automation, and drone warfare become increasingly interconnected. Baker Hughes is best known as a provider of energy and oilfield services. That makes the company’s earnings and stock price sensitive to the price of oil and natural gas. A closer look at the company’s earnings report shows how it continues to transform itself into a technology-driven industrial player. Specifically, Baker Hughes is building adjacent capabilities in digital infrastructure, industrial AI, and process optimization. These are assets that could quietly align it with next-generation defense priorities. After the passage of the Trump administration’s “One Big, Beautiful Bill,” the U.S. defense budget for fiscal 2025 will exceed $900 billion. That dollar figure is impressive, but it’s where those dollars will be allocated that may be more significant to Baker Hughes. The U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) intends to make significant allocations toward unmanned systems (e.g., drones), energy resilience, and digital warfare. That has many investors looking to traditional defense contractors like Lockheed Martin Corp. NYSE: LMT and Northrop Grumman Corp. NYSE: NOC. However, to accomplish its objectives, the DOD will have to turn to industrial technology providers to source advanced capabilities in the energy space. This is where Baker Hughes may fit in. Like most energy stocks, Baker Hughes has had an “okay” year. BKR stock is up about 6.8% year-to-date. However, the stock jumped over 9.5% after its second quarter earnings report. A key factor was the company’s revenue of $6.8 billion, along with a 130-basis-point increase in operating margin. But what’s more revealing is where the growth is coming from. In short, Baker Hughes is not just about notoriously cyclical pumps and pipes. The company is pivoting into sensors, software, AI-driven diagnostics, and modular energy systems. It's important to emphasize that this isn’t happening today. However, there are reasons to believe Baker Hughes can fit into the Pentagon’s long-term plans. To understand this, it’s important to remember that drones are complex systems that require predictive maintenance, remote power systems, and AI-based monitoring and control systems. These are areas where Baker Hughes’ industrial tools could find crossover applications. For example: The company’s earnings presentation noted, “We continue to invest in technologies that support electrification and energy efficiency across industries.” Given that the U.S. Department of Defense increasingly awards contracts to tech-forward industrial partners, BKR could be on the shortlist for non-traditional support roles, especially in energy and logistics. From mid-June to mid-July, BKR stock formed an ascending triangle pattern. A breakout above resistance on strong earnings and volume confirms this bullish formation. With the sharp run-up after earnings, BKR stock has pushed well above its 50-day simple moving average. A bullish reversal in the MACD also supports the sharp move higher.  However, with an RSI above 80 as of this writing, BKR may be due for a short-term pullback. Even without the potential catalyst from defense contracts, Baker Hughes looks like a good value at this level. To begin with, even after the sharp post-earnings move, Baker Hughes is trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 16.8x. That’s slightly above the stock’s historical average, but it’s reasonable relative to the sector average. Furthermore, the company approved a $3 billion share repurchase authorization and pays a dividend with a 2.4% yield. Before you consider Baker Hughes, you'll want to hear this.

MarketBeat Week in Review – 07/21 - 07/25,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/marketbeat-week-in-review-07-21-07-25/,"Stocks were up this week as the summer rally continues. There was mixed news from the tech sector this week, but on the whole, earnings have been better-than-expected. That trend will likely continue when many mega-cap technology stocks report next week. Continued capital expenditures in artificial intelligence are likely to be bullish for the sector. Another big story this week was the finalization of a trade deal between the United States and Japan. However, tariff uncertainty still lingers, particularly with the Trump administration’s August 1 deadline looming. There’s a lot to be sorted out that could move markets. Next week will be an important week for economic data. The Federal Reserve will issue its next decision on interest rates on Wednesday. The expectation is for no change in interest rates, but investors will look for any signal that a cut is coming in September. However, the bigger market mover may come from the July Jobs report on Friday. Articles by Thomas Hughes As important as AI is to investors today, Thomas Hughes wrote this week that Physical AI is the real endgame for this technology. However, that endgame is already taking shape, and Hughes gave investors five physical AI stocks that investors could buy today and hold for triple-digit returns. Turning his attention to value stocks, Hughes analyzed the earnings report from Verizon Communications, Inc. NYSE: VZ. The stock is known for its high-yield dividend, but Hughes explained why VZ stock is a solid growth opportunity after its bullish report. Congressional trading activity has become a topic of keen interest to investors. This week, Hughes highlighted the five stocks with the most Congressional selling in the year's first half and explained why you may or may not want to follow their lead. Articles by Sam Quirke Tesla Inc. NASDAQ: TSLA stock was down sharply after the company’s earnings report, in which chief executive officer (CEO) Elon Musk warned that the next two quarters could be challenging. Sam Quirke broke down the report and explained why analysts are playing the long game as traders move out of the stock. Qualcomm Inc. NASDAQ: QCOM is one of the more undervalued semiconductor stocks. Quirke noted that a recent price target hike and the company’s upcoming earnings report may mean the rally in QCOM stock is just getting started. On the other end of the value spectrum, Amazon.com Inc. NASDAQ: AMZN stock has rallied toward its February high. However, Quirke pointed out that the stock now comes with a relatively high valuation. That means investors may need a strong earnings report to push the stock higher. Articles by Chris Markoch Palantir Technologies Inc. NASDAQ: PLTR continues to outperform the broader market in 2025. However, Chris Markoch highlighted the sentiment shift between technical indicators and options activity. This could make PLTR stock more volatile than usual heading into its earnings report in early August. Many consumer discretionary stocks continue to underperform the market. However, that’s not the case for three streaming stocks. All three are moving lower after hitting an all-time high, but Markoch explained why each could reverse that trend with solid earnings. Markoch also introduced MarketBeat’s new FDA Events Tool and highlighted three small-cap biotech stocks with critical upcoming catalysts that could give investors a good reason to accumulate shares for future growth. Articles by Ryan Hasson All good things must come to an end. As Ryan Hasson wrote this week, that’s the general sentiment around the recent pullback in Rocket Lab USA Inc. NASDAQ: RKLB stock. The stock is down double digits from its parabolic move to an all-time high, but Hasson notes that technical and fundamental factors support the long-term bull case, which could make this a time to buy the dip. Alphabet Inc. NASDAQ: GOOGL stock has been lagging its Magnificent Seven counterparts this year. However, Hasson explained why that may change after the company crushed its earnings report and answered some key questions about the health of its search, cloud computing, and AI businesses. Investors may notice that risk-on sentiment is starting to run rampant. Hasson noted that impulse could be good for investors with room for speculative stocks in their portfolio. This week, Hasson analyzed five high-risk/high-reward stocks that are showing strong momentum. Articles by Gabriel Osorio-Mazilli The latest cryptocurrency rally started with Bitcoin surging to an all-time high. However, Gabriel Osorio-Mazilli explained to investors that the real opportunity may be in these three stocks that are bringing Bitcoin to the broader market. A sharp move higher in several stocks has some analysts believing meme stock mania is back. However, when it comes to the surge in Opendoor Technologies Inc. NASDAQ: OPEN, Osorio-Mazilli highlighted some key fundamental reasons that make the stock more than a retail play. Enthusiasm over the buildout of an AI infrastructure is reaching a fever pitch. Osorio-Mazilli explained why that is bullish for Super Micro Computer Inc. NASDAQ: SMCI. Institutional investors have moved beyond the accounting irregularities from earlier this year and are now leading the stock higher. Articles by Leo Miller A key theme in the tech sector is how one company’s growth plans positively impact another company’s stock. Leo Miller gave investors an example of that this week. Miller explained why Meta Platform Inc. NASDAQ: META's plans to invest in “titan cluster” data centers are a game-changer for Broadcom Inc. NASDAQ: AVGO stock. The quantum computing space continues to evolve quickly. This week, Miller highlighted the recent surge in Rigetti Computing Inc. NASDAQ: RGTI stock, being fueled by the company’s decision to take a step back to make a strong move forward. When companies raise their guidance, analysts typically begin raising their price targets. That combination is always bullish for a stock in the long term. This week, Miller pointed investors to four stocks receiving higher price targets fresh off of raised guidance in their earnings reports. Articles by Nathan Reiff This week, Nathan Reiff analyzed the recent surge in shares of D-Wave Quantum Inc. NYSE: QBTS. The stock appeared to be moving higher in concert with other quantum computing stocks. However, with no specific catalyst for the spike, Reiff reminded investors that, while QBTS stock looks promising, caution should be the watchword as profitability remains elusive. Companies are sometimes punished when an earnings report is only “good enough.” Reiff explained why that appears to be the case with three stocks that are down despite solid, but not spectacular, reports. This can be where long-term investors should pay attention to analysts upgrading these stocks, which could signal a buy-the-dip opportunity. Despite the continued interest in high-growth technology stocks, Reiff pointed out that investors looking for passive income and growth through dividend stocks haven’t been disappointed. That’s particularly true if they own one of the three high-yield dividend payers that carry some risk, but offer the chance of a market-beating reward. Articles by Dan Schmidt “Is China investable again?” Dan Schmidt attempted to answer this week. Schmidt noted that with trade tensions easing, three large-cap Chinese stocks are starting to look good for value investors. Robinhood Markets Inc. NASDAQ: HOOD has been one of the best-performing stocks in 2025. This week, Schmidt pointed out a small line item in the One Big, Beautiful Bill that will make the stock more attractive to professional sports bettors looking to reduce their tax burden. Articles by Jeffrey Neal Johnson Many MarketBeat analysts wrote about specific quantum computing stocks this week. Jeffrey Neal Johnson compiled much of that information to explain what catalysts are pushing three quantum computing stocks higher this summer. Johnson also wrote about the recent price spike in AST Spacemobile Inc. NASDAQ: ASTS after a recent contract announcement. Analysts haven’t jumped on board yet, but Johnson reminded investors that this could be one time when being early is just fine. The U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) has $900 billion to put to use. However, as Johnson wrote this week, it won’t be business as usual, which is good news for investors in Kratos Defense & Security Solutions Inc. NASDAQ: KTOS. Articles by Jordan Chussler Investing in AI and data centers doesn’t have to be exclusive to growth investors. This week, Jordan Chussler highlighted Iron Mountain Inc. NYSE: IRM, which operates as a real estate investment trust (REIT) in the data center space. Chussler explained why the company’s fundamentals suggest the stock could be an undervalued gem for buy-and-hold value investors. Speaking of value investors, many such investors walked away from AT&T Inc. NYSE: T after it cut its dividend in 2022. However, Chussler explained why recent legislation is likely to be bullish for the company’s fundamentals, and institutional buyers are starting to take notice.

US-China trade talks: Can China reduce its export dependence?,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/us-china-trade-talks-can-china-reduce-its-export-dependence-2025-07-26/,"BEIJING (AP) — China’s high dependence on exports will likely be a key focus of a new round of U.S.-China trade talks this coming week in Stockholm, but a trade deal would not necessarily help Beijing to rebalance its economy. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said he hopes the negotiations can take up this issue, along with China's purchases of oil from Russia and Iran, which undercut American sanctions on those two countries. Hopes rose for a breakthrough in talks after U.S. President Donald Trump announced deals with Japan, Indonesia and the Philippines this week. The U.S. wants China to do two things: Reduce what both the U.S. and the European Union see as excess production capacity in many industries, including steel and electric vehicles. And secondly, to take steps to increase spending by Chinese consumers so the economy relies more on domestic demand and less on exports. “We could also discuss the elephant in the room, which is this great rebalancing that the Chinese need to do,” Bessent told financial news network CNBC. He said China's share of global manufacturing exports at nearly 30%, “can’t get any bigger, and it should probably shrink.” The issues are not new, and China has been working to address them for years, more for domestic reasons than to reduce its trade surpluses with the U.S. and other countries. Bessent's predecessor as treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, made industrial policy a focus of a trip to China last year. She blamed government subsidies for flooding the global market with “artificially cheap Chinese products.” The European Union, whose top leaders met their Chinese counterparts in Beijing on Thursday, has cited subsidies to justify EU tariffs on electric vehicles made in China. In the 1980s, the U.S. pressured Japan to boost consumer spending when American manufacturing was overwhelmed by exports from the likes of Toyota and Sony. Economists have long argued that China likewise needs to transform into a more consumer-driven economy. Consumer spending accounts for less than 40% of China’s economy, versus close to 70% in the United States and about 54% in Japan. Chinese leaders have spoken about both factory overcapacity and weak consumer spending as long-term problems and have sought over the past 20 years to find ways to rebalance the economy away from export manufacturing and massive investments in dams, roads, railways and other infrastructure. Fierce price wars have prompted critical reports in official media saying that companies are “racing to the bottom,” skimping on quality and even safety to reduce costs. With strong government support, they've also expanded overseas, where they can charge higher prices but still undercut local competitors, creating a political backlash. All that competition and price cutting has left China battling deflation, or falling prices. When companies receive less for their products, they tend to invest less. That can lead to job cuts and lower wages, sapping business activity and spending power — contrary to the long-term goal of increasing the share of consumer spending in driving overall growth. To counter that, the government is spending billions on rebates and subsidies for people who trade in their cars or appliances for new ones. But acknowledging a problem and solving it are two different things. Economists say more fundamental changes are needed to boost consumption and rein in overcapacity. Such changes can only come incrementally over time. Private Chinese companies and foreign-invested companies create the most jobs, but they've suffered from swings in policy and pressures from the trade war, especially since the pandemic. Demographic changes are another challenge as China's population shrinks and ages. Many experts advocate expanding China's social safety net, health insurance, pensions and other support systems, so that people would feel freer to spend rather than save for a medical emergency or retirement. Yan Se, an economist at Peking University's Guanghua School of Management, warned at a recent forum that deflation will become a long-term issue if China doesn't step up its welfare benefits. “Chinese people deserve a better life,"" he said. One possibility, put forward at the same forum by Liu Qiao, the dean of the business school, would be to change incentives for local government officials, rewarding them for raising consumption or household incomes instead of meeting an economic growth target. He doesn't see that happening nationwide but said it could be tested in a province. “That would send out a message that China needs a different approach,” he said. Chinese leader Xi Jinping has made transforming the country into a technology superpower a top priority. It's a goal that has gained urgency as the U.S. has tightened restrictions on China's access to high-end semiconductors and other advanced knowhow. Output in high-tech manufacturing is growing quickly, adding to potential overcapacity, just as what happened with the government's encouragement of “green” technologies such as solar panels and wind turbines. Various industries, including EV makers, have pledged to address the issue, but some local governments are striving to keep money-losing enterprises afloat, reluctant to lose tax revenues and jobs, or to fail to meet economic growth targets. Going forward, the government is calling for more coordination of economic development polices in fields such as artificial intelligence so that not every province champions the same industry. But government moves to counter the impact of higher tariffs tend to support sectors already in overcapacity, and the share of consumption in the economy has fallen in recent years. “A sustained improvement in household consumption will require greater reform ambition,” the World Bank said in its most recent update on China's economy."" ___ AP Business Writer Elaine Kurtenbach in Bangkok contributed to this report.

Policy officially takes over for Murphy as president/CEO at Packers' shareholders meeting,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/policy-officially-takes-over-for-murphy-as-presidentceo-at-packers-shareholders-meeting-2025-07-25/,"GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) — Ed Policy began his tenure as the Green Bay Packers’ president/CEO by paying tribute to his predecessor. Policy officially took over for Mark Murphy on Friday as the NFL’s only publicly owned franchise held its annual shareholders meeting. During Murphy’s 17 seasons on the job, the Packers made 13 playoff appearances, with the 2010 team winning a Super Bowl. “I assure you that going forward I’m going to lean heavily on your example and your pearls of wisdom as I move the organization into the future,” Policy said. Murphy is stepping down because he reached the franchise’s mandatory retirement age of 70 earlier this month. Murphy said he felt he could continue meeting the demands of this position but added that he agrees with the Packers’ retirement policy. “In my career – business and with the league and others – you see examples where maybe people stay on a little too long, so I think this serves the Packers well,” Murphy said. Policy, 54, didn’t focus much on his own plans during the shareholders meeting, which instead pretty much served as a testimonial for Murphy. There were plenty of shouts of “Thank you, Mark,” among the 6,529 shareholders in the Lambeau Field stands. On a hot afternoon, many shareholders tried to cool themselves off by waving fans that featured Murphy’s face. A tribute video included messages from NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and former commissioner Paul Tagliabue among others. Murphy signed autographs and greeted fans after the Packers’ Friday morning practice and again after the shareholders meeting. “It’s a little bittersweet,” Murphy said. “Obviously, I’m a very appreciative and I also feel honored, too, that the fans have been so supportive of me and the organization. But (I’m) really excited too for the future of the organization and for Ed in particular.” The Packers say Murphy, who played defensive back for Washington from 1977-84, is believed to be the only person to earn a Super Bowl ring both as a player and as a team’s chief executive. He was on Washington’s 1982 championship team. His stint as Green Bay’s president/CEO included the construction of Titletown, a 45-acre development adjacent to Lambeau Field that features shops, restaurants and apartments. He capped his tenure earlier this year by welcoming the NFL Draft to Green Bay, an event that drew an announced three-day total attendance of 600,000. Murphy also presided over multiple renovations to Lambeau Field, including the opening of a new home locker room this week. “He’s been tremendous for us,” wide receiver Jayden Reed said. “I thanked him today, knowing this was his last day here, so I went up to him and I thanked him for everything. Without him, we wouldn’t be standing in this locker room right now. He’s been a tremendous help to all of us, very supportive. He gets this thing done. I appreciate him for that.” Murphy said he hopes to stay involved in the game and noted that he’s talked to Goodell about things he’d like to do on a league level. He also mentioned spending more time with his family and increasing his involvement in his charity work and in the golf course he owns at Baileys Harbor, Wisconsin. The Packers’ board of directors unanimously selected Policy as Murphy’s replacement after a search committee recommended him last year. Policy, the son of former San Francisco 49ers and Cleveland Browns president, joined the Packers as vice president and general counsel in August 2012 and was promoted to chief operating officer in January 2018. “I want to thank you, our owners, for investing so much in me over the past 13 years,” Policy told the shareholders. “It’s been really special, and I intend to pay it back with results both on and off the field.” Packers coach Matt LaFleur, general manager Brian Gutekunst and executive vice president/director of player operations Russ Ball report to the president/CEO under the team’s leadership structure. All three of them have two years remaining on their contracts. Policy said earlier this year he has no plans to extend those contracts before this season, though he praised all three men and noted his long working relationships with them. “(I’m) certainly going to miss Mark and everything that he’s done for this place, but feel like we’re in great hands with a guy like Ed Policy,” LaFleur said. Murphy was asked what advice he had for Policy. “The one thing I told him is he’s got to be himself,” Murphy said. “I’ve seen him grow quite a bit as a leader. The search ended up with him. They did a great job. There’s no question he’s positioned and ready to have success. “He and I have talked about it. Don’t be afraid to change things. Follow your instincts. He’s got really good business sense. Hopefully we put him in a position where he can have success not only in the short term but the long term of the organization.” NOTES: LaFleur said OL Aaron Banks is “day to day” with a back issue. … Rookie WR Savion Williams didn’t practice Friday due to a concussion. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

Citi launches Strata Elite Card to compete with AmEx and Chase,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/citi-launches-strata-elite-card-to-compete-with-amex-and-chase-2025-07-27/,"NEW YORK (AP) — There’s a new but familiar face coming to the world of high-end credit cards. Citigroup is launching the Strata Elite Card, the bank’s latest attempt to grab a piece of the high-fee, high-rewards credit card market that’s dominated by American Express’ Platinum Card and JPMorgan Chase’s Sapphire Reserve Card. The card, which is priced less than the Platinum Card and the Sapphire Reserve Card at an annual fee of $595, will offer points multiples for certain types of spending, like hotels, car rents, air travel and restaurants. Additionally, the card will offer points for everyday spending, as well as a $300 hotel credit and a $200 “splurge” credit at brands like Best Buy, Live Nation and others. Citi has had other forays into the high-end credit card market. The company launched Citi Prestige in 2013 as a direct competitor to the American Express Platinum Card, and the card won high praise from travel fanatics when it debuted for its hefty rewards program and perks. But Prestige lost its prestige when Chase launched the Sapphire Reserve Card, a credit card that was an instant hit when it was released in 2016, and when AmEx overhauled the Platinum Card to be more competitive. Citi stopped allowing new applications for Prestige in 2021, but the card’s benefits still exist for customers carrying the card. Strata Elite is facing a highly competitive marketplace. Along with the Platinum Card and Sapphire Reserve, there are other rewards-heavy cards like Capital One’s Venture X Card and a coming high rewards card from credit card upstart Bilt early next year. Chase raised the annual fee on Sapphire Reserve to $795 as part of a product refresh in June, and American Express has indicated it will be revising the Platinum Card’s rewards and perks later this year. A customer who ends up carrying two of these high-fee cards can quickly spend more than $1,000 on annual fees. So far, credit card companies have been able to justify these fees by attaching lucrative perks to the cards, like travel or other spending credits, and generous rewards programs, effectively marketing them as a high-end subscription plan. But it’s not clear how willing customers are to carry several of these cards each year. This is the third in the Citi Strata card family, following a similar formula to other banks where there’s a “good, better, best” choice for customers. The other cards are the Citi Strata Card and Strata Premier. The biggest earning potential on Citi’s new card is by booking travel through Citi’s new travel portal, which gives 12 times points on Citi’s “Thank You” rewards program. Credit card companies are trying to push customers onto their own travel portals, where banks can contract directly with airlines and hotels and make sure customers use their branded credit cards when traveling. American Express, Chase and Capital One have all built out their travel services in recent years and are increasingly offering customers better rewards and redemptions for using their services instead of booking through a place like Expedia.

Paramount gets green light for $8 billion merger. But what is the psychic cost for company?,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/paramount-gets-green-light-for-8-billion-merger-but-what-is-the-psychic-cost-for-company-2025-07-25/,"With this week’s FCC approval, the merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media is expected to be completed in the coming weeks at a value of $8 billion. The question for the new company is whether the psychic cost is much higher. It has been a particularly rough few months at Paramount-owned CBS, where the settlement of a lawsuit regarding “60 Minutes” and announced end of Stephen Colbert's late-night show has led critics to suggest corporate leaders were bowing to President Donald Trump. Following the Federal Communications Commission approval Thursday, one of the triumvirate of current Paramount leaders, Chris McCarthy, said that he would be leaving the company. McCarthy has been in charge of fading cable properties like MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon, expected to bear the brunt of an estimated $2 billion in cost cuts identified by Skydance leaders. Skydance head David Ellison is expected to head the new company, and he has identified former NBC Universal executive Jeff Shell as the incoming president. After the merger's Aug. 7 closing date, the new leaders will be watched most closely for how they deal with CBS News, particularly given the $16 million paid in a settlement of Trump's complaint that last fall's “60 Minutes” interview was edited to make opponent Kamala Harris look good. Two news executives — News CEO Wendy McMahon and “60 Minutes” executive producer Bill Owens — resigned due to their opposition to the deal. The appointment of respected insider Tanya Simon to replace Owens this week was seen as a positive sign by people at “60 Minutes.” Days before the FCC's vote, Paramount agreed to hire an ombudsman at CBS News with the mission of investigating complaints of political bias. “In all respects, Skydance will ensure that CBS's reporting is fair, unbiased, and fact-based,” Skydance said in a letter to FCC Chairman Brendan Carr. The role of an ombudsman, or public editor, who examines a news outlet's work is often positive — if they are given independence, said Kelly McBride, an ethics expert who has had that role at NPR for five years. “You really want the person to have loyalty only to their own judgment and the journalistic mission of the organization,” she said. Having the sole mission of examining bias could be problematic, however. To be fair, a journalist's work should be closely studied before making that determination, not judged on the basis of one report or passage, she said. Carr, in an interview with CNBC on Friday, said the role “should go a long way toward restoring America's trust in media.” Anna Gomez, an FCC commissioner who voted to reject the deal on Thursday, interpreted the arrangement as a way for the government to control journalists. “They want the news media to report on them in a positive light or in the light that they want,” Gomez told MSNBC. “So they don't want the media to do their job, which is to hold government to account without fear or favor.” According to published reports, Ellison has explored purchasing The Free Press, a flourishing news site founded by Bari Weiss perhaps best known for a former NPR editor's study of liberal bias in public broadcasting. An Ellison spokeswoman did not return a message seeking comment on Friday. Colbert's slow-motion firing — he'll work until the end of his contract next May — was described by CBS as a financial decision given late-night television's collapsing economics. Colbert's relentless lampooning of Trump, and his criticism of the “60 Minutes” settlement, led to suspicion of those motives. “Was this really financial?” comic Jon Stewart wondered. ""Or maybe the path of least resistance for your $8 billion merger was killing a show that you know rankled a fragile and vengeful president?” Stewart's profane criticism on his own Paramount-owned show may provide its own test for Skydance. “The Daily Show” is one of the few original programs left on Comedy Central, and his contract ends later this year. In an odd way, Comedy Central's “South Park” buttresses CBS' claim that the Colbert decision was financial, not political. Creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone delivered an episode this week that depicted a naked Trump in bed with the devil. Paramount just signed Parker and Stone to a new $1.5 billion deal that Skydance executives surely cleared; it makes the entire “South Park” library available for streaming on Paramount+. a platform where Colbert's show doesn't do nearly as well. Figuring out what to do with others at Paramount's cable networks, or even the networks as a whole, will be an early decision for Ellison, son of multibillionaire and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison. “There is a clear opportunity to improve Paramount's growth profile by letting those assets go,” analyst Doug Creutz of TD Securities told investors Friday. “On the other hand, we suspect the Ellisons did not purchase Paramount in order to break it up for parts.” The merger also brings together the Paramount movie studio with one of its most regular partners. David Ellison has been one of the industry's top investors and producers since founding Skydance in 2006. Ellison has a challenge here, too: Years of uncertainty over its future and modest investment in its movie pipeline has shrunk Paramount's market share to last among the major studios. The Paramount+ streaming service has been a money-loser. To revive Paramount, Ellison will look to revamp its streaming operations, leverage its franchises and try to bolster family content. ___ AP Film Writer Jake Coyle contributed to this report.

"Tea, an app for women to safely talk about men they date, has been breached, user IDs exposed",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/tea-an-app-for-women-to-safely-talk-about-men-they-date-has-been-breached-user-ids-exposed-2025-07-25/,"Tea, an app designed to let women safely discuss men they date has been breached, with thousands of selfies and photo IDs of users exposed, the company confirmed on Friday. Tea said that about 72,000 images were leaked online, including 13,000 images of selfies or selfies featuring a photo identification that users submitted during account verification. Another 59,000 images publicly viewable in the app from posts, comments and direct messages were also accessed without authorization, according to a Tea spokesperson. No email addresses or phone numbers were accessed, the company said, and the breach only affects users who signed up before February 2024. “Tea has engaged third-party cybersecurity experts and are working around the clock to secure its systems,” the company said. “At this time, there is no evidence to suggest that additional user data was affected. Protecting tea users’ privacy and data is their highest priority.” Tea presents itself as a safe way for women to anonymously vet men they might connect with on dating apps such as Tinder or Bumble — ensuring that your date is “safe, not a catfish, and not in a relationship.” “Tea is a must-have app, helping women avoid red flags before the first date with dating advice, and showing them who’s really behind the profile of the person they’re dating,” reads Tea's app store description. 404 Media, which earlier reported the breach, said it was 4Chan users who discovered an exposed database that “allowed anyone to access the material"" from Tea. “While reporting this story, a URL the 4chan user posted included a voluminous list of specific attachments associated with the Tea app. 404 Media saw this list of files. In the last hour or so, that page was locked down, and now returns a “Permission denied” error,” 404 Media reported Friday. Tea said in an Instagram post this week that it has reached 4 million users. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.
