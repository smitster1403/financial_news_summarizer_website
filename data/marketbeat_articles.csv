Asian shares trade mostly higher after stocks on Wall Street extend losses,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/asian-shares-trade-mostly-higher-after-stocks-on-wall-street-extend-losses-2025-08-05/,"TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares were mostly higher in muted trading Wednesday, after discouraging signs about the U.S. economy sent Wall Street shares declining, and Investors are sifting through a slew of corporate earnings reports to assess how businesses may have been affected by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs. Among Japanese companies, automakers Honda Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. will report fiscal first quarter results this week, as will electronics and entertainment company Sony Corp. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 rose 0.6% to 40,777.45. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.6% to 8,822.90. South Korea's Kospi lost 0.3% to 3,187.57. Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.2% to 24,947.57, while the Shanghai Composite gained 0.3% to 3,627.54. U.S. futures were up 0.3%. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 fell 0.5% to 6,299.19, coming off a whipsaw stretch where it went from its worst day since May to its best since May. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.1% to 44,111.74, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.7% to 20,916.55. A weaker-than-expected report on activity for U.S. businesses in services industries like transportation and retail added to worries that Trump’s tariffs  may be hurting the economy. But conversely such indicators raise hopes the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates. That along with a stream of stronger-than-expected profit reports from U.S. companies helped to keep losses in check. The S&P 500 remains within 1.4% of its record. The pressure is on companies to report bigger profits after the U.S. stock market surged to record after record from a low point in April. The big rally fueled criticism that the broad market had become too expensive. For stock prices to look like better bargains, companies could produce bigger profits, or interest rates could fall. The latter may happen in September, when the Fed has its next policy meeting. Expectations have built sharply for a rate cut at that meeting since a report on the U.S. job market on Friday came in much weaker than economists expected. Lower interest rates would make stocks look less expensive, while also giving the overall economy a boost. The potential downside is that they could push inflation higher. Treasury yields sank sharply after Friday’s release of the jobs report, and they haven’t recovered. The yield on the 10-year Treasury eased to 4.19% from 4.22% late Monday and from 4.39% just before the release of the jobs report. That’s a significant move for the bond market. In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude rose 41 cents to $65.57 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, added 42 cents to $68.06 a barrel. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar dipped to 147.34 Japanese yen from 147.61 yen. The euro cost $1.1583, up from $1.1579. ___ AP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed.

"As Trump cracks down on college student visas, other countries see opportunity",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/as-trump-cracks-down-on-college-student-visas-other-countries-see-opportunity-2025-08-05/,"LONDON (AP) — In China, wait times for U.S. visa interviews are so long that some students have given up. Universities in Hong Kong are fielding transfer inquiries from foreign students in the U.S., and international applications for British undergraduate programs have surged. President Donald Trump’s administration has been pressuring U.S. colleges to reduce their dependence on international enrollment while adding new layers of scrutiny for foreign students as part of its crackdown on immigration. The U.S. government has sought to deport foreign students for participating in pro-Palestinian activism. In the spring, it abruptly revoked the legal status of thousands of international students, including some whose only brush with law enforcement was a traffic ticket. After reversing course, the government paused new appointments for student visas while rolling out a process for screening applicants’ social media accounts. The U.S. remains the first choice for many international students, but institutions elsewhere are recognizing opportunity in the upheaval, and applicants are considering destinations they might have otherwise overlooked. The impact on U.S. universities — and the nation's economy — may be significant. New international enrollment in the U.S. could drop by 30% to 40% this fall, according to an analysis of visa and enrollment data by NAFSA, an agency that promotes international education. That would deprive the U.S. economy of $7 billion in spending, according to the analysis. Many international students pay full price, so their absence would also hurt college budgets. As the second most popular destination for international students, Britain is positioned to benefit.and The country's new Labour government has vowed to cut migration, and officials have imposed time limits on post-study visas allowing graduates to stay and work. But admissions consultants say the United Kingdom is still seen as the most welcoming of the traditional “big four” English-speaking destinations in higher education — the U.S., U.K., Canada and Australia. After declining last year, the number of international applications for undergraduate study in the U.K. this fall grew by 2.2%, official figures show. A record number of applications came from China, up 10% compared with the previous year. Applications from the U.S. also reached nearly 8,000 students — an increase of 14% and a 20-year high. Acceptances of international students for graduate programs in the U.K. grew an estimated 10% from last year, driven by demand for business and management courses in particular, according to data from UniQuest, which works with many British universities on admissions. Data showing the extent of any impact will not be available until fall, said Mike Henniger, CEO of Illume Student Advisory Services, a consultancy that works with colleges in the U.S., Canada and Europe. “But the American brand has taken a massive hit, and the U.K. is the one that is benefiting,"" he said. Demand from Chinese students has risen rapidly for universities places in Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia, said Will Kwong, managing director of AAS Education, a consultancy in Hong Kong. Many Western universities have offshore campuses there that are more affordable than going to the U.S. or U.K. “Opting for study in Asia has been a trend since the easing of COVID-19,” Kwong said. “But obviously it’s been exacerbated by the change of administration in the U.S.” Some Asian families have told him the U.S. is no longer their clear first choice because of political turbulence and visa difficulties, many are still waiting for U.S. visa interviews and will likely miss the start of the fall term, Kwong said. Chinese college student Alisa, who is studying data science, plans to attend an exchange program this fall at the University of California, Berkeley. She hopes to pursue a master's degree in the U.S. But she is also looking into other options “just so I could still go to school if the extreme scenario occurs,” said Alisa, who spoke on condition of partial anonymity out of fear of being targeted. Hong Kong will welcome any students who are denied entry to the U.S., the city's leader John Lee has said. Last year, the Chinese territory decided to allow international students to work part-time. Hong Kong University said it has received over 500 inquiries from students in the U.S. and is processing around 200 applications for transfer. At another school, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, international undergraduate applications have surged by 40% from last year, said Alison Lloyd, associate provost on institutional data and research. Countries including the United Arab Emirates have invested heavily in attracting international students by partnering with universities elsewhere to host branch campuses. These arrangements could appeal to students who fear being denied access to the U.S. Dubai, which has designs on becoming a global education hub, hosts dozens of international institutions’ satellite campuses. It saw international student numbers grow by a third in 2024-2025. Lisa Johnson, principal of Dubai's private American Academy for Girls, said her mostly Emirati student body is increasingly looking away from the U.S. for college. “Every student wants and dreams to go to Harvard,” she said. “But as college options increase in the United Arab Emirates, more and more students are staying."" Kazakhstan has similar ambitions, said Daniel Palm, who has helped U.S. universities set up campuses abroad. Illinois Tech and the University of Arizona are among colleges offering degree programs in the Central Asian country, drawing students mostly from China and Russia. “All of a sudden U.S. colleges are asking how to provide diversity, provide access,"" Palm said, ""because you have students who want to come to the U.S. and can't."" ___ Associated Press writers Kanis Leung in Hong Kong; Albee Zhang in Washington, D.C.; and Gabe Levin in Dubai contributed.

Trump's pursuit of meeting with Chinese leader reveals the complex web of US-China relations,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trumps-pursuit-of-meeting-with-chinese-leader-reveals-the-complex-web-of-us-china-relations-2025-08-05/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — China, the adversary. China, the friend? These days, maybe a bit of both. From easing export controls to reportedly blocking the Taiwanese president's plans to travel through the United States, President Donald Trump is raising eyebrows in Washington that he might offer concessions that could hurt U.S. interests in his quest to meet, and reach a deal with, the Chinese leader. There is no firm plan for Trump to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping. But it's widely believed that the men must meet in person, likely in the fall, for the two governments to ink a trade deal, and some are worried that Xi is leveraging Trump's desire for more giveaways. ""The summit mismatch is real. There’s a clear gap between Trump’s eagerness for a face-to-face with Xi and Beijing’s reluctance to engage,"" said Craig Singleton, senior director of the China program at the Washington-based think tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies. There are concerns that Trump may throttle back on export controls or investment curbs to preserve summit prospects, Singleton said, warning the risk “isn't just in giving away too much” but also ""in letting Beijing set the tempo.” China-U.S. relations have pinballed often since Washington established relations with communist-led Beijing in 1979. They've hit highs and lows — the latter in the aftermath of the 1989 massacre of pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square, after a 2001 incident involving a U.S. spy plane, during the COVID pandemic and right now. Both countries have struggled to understand each other, which has sometimes gotten in the way of deeper partnerships. And this time around, there's a wild card: the anything-might-happen second presidency of Trump. Efforts by a U.S. president to meet the head of the authoritarian Chinese government have often met with partisan outcries — which happened when former President Joe Biden hosted Xi in California in 2023. But Trump's case is peculiar, partly because he is willing to break with conventional political restraints to make deals and partly because his own party has grown hawkish towards China over national security. “With President Trump, everything seems to be open for negotiation, and there are few if any red lines,” said Gabriel Wildau, managing director of the global consultancy Teneo. “The hawks worry that if Trump gets into a room with Xi, he will agree to extraordinary concessions, especially if he believes that a big, beautiful deal is within reach.” While most Republican lawmakers have not voiced their concerns openly, Democrats are vocal in their opposition. ""President Trump is giving away the farm to Xi just so he can save face and reach a nonsensical trade deal with Beijing that will hurt American families economically,"" said Rep. Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. On Tuesday, Kush Desai, a White House spokesman, said the Trump administration “has not wavered — and will never waver — in safeguarding our national and economic security to put America first.” “The administration continues to have productive conversations with China to address longstanding unfair trade practices,” Desai said, adding that export controls on cutting-edge technology and many tariffs remain in place. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, after his latest round of trade negotiations with the Chinese in July, told CNBC that the team was “very careful to keep trade and national security separate.” And Secretary of State Marco Rubio, appearing on Fox News Radio, said the U.S. remains “as committed as ever to our partners ... in places like Taiwan” but also spoke of the strategic need to keep trade ties with China steady. “In the end, we have two big, the two largest economies in the world,” Rubio said. “An all-out trade conflict between the U.S. and China, I think the U.S. would benefit from it in some ways, but the world would be hurt by it."" Taiwan is concerned that the self-governing island could be “trade-able” when Trump seeks a deal with Beijing, said Jason Hsu, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute and a former legislator in Taiwan. “Our concern is that, will any of the trade deals lead to concession on political support for Taiwan?"" Hsu said, citing the case last month where the White House allegedly blocked a request for Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te to transit through the United States. The U.S. maintains unofficial ties with Taiwan and has always allowed such transits in the past. Experts are worried that the Trump administration is setting a bad precedent, and Democrats have seized on it to criticize Trump. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, the top Democrat on the House Select Committee on China, called the move “both a sharp break from precedent and another example of the Trump administration caving to China in hopes of reaching a trade deal."" He said the policy decision “sends a dangerous signal” that Taiwan’s democracy is negotiable. Hsu said Taiwan fears that Trump could be coerced or compelled to support the one-China principle, as espoused by Beijing, that acknowledges Beijing's sovereignty claim over the island. There are also concerns that Trump might utter anything in support of “unification."" That was a request Beijing raised with the Biden administration, though it failed to get a positive response. Now, it's upon Taiwan to persuade Trump to think of the island as “an economic partner rather than something that he can trade when he negotiates with China,” Hsu said, suggesting that Taiwan step up defense commitments, increase energy procurement, open its market to U.S. companies and invest more in the U.S. But Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, said Trump is bound by the Taiwan Relations Act, a domestic law that obligates the U.S. to maintain an unofficial relationship with the island and provides it with sufficient hardware to deter any invasion by China. “He can dial the (U.S.-Taiwan) relationship up and down,"" Sun said, ""but he can’t remove the relationship.” In April, the White House, citing national security, announced it would restrict sales of Nvidia’s H20 computer chips to China. The ban was lifted about three months later, when the two governments had climbed down from sky-high tariffs and harsh trade restrictions. The decision upset both Republican and Democratic lawmakers. Rep. John Moolenaar, a Michigan Republican who chairs the House Select Committee on China, wrote to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to stress that the U.S. cannot let the Chinese Communist Party “use American chips to train AI models that will power its military, censor its people, and undercut American innovation.” In Stockholm, Bessent pushed back at the concern that national security might be compromised. “We are very diligent,” Bessent said, adding there's an interagency process that involves the National Security Council and the Defense Department for decisions. “There's nothing that's being exchanged for anything,” Bessent said. Addressing H20 chips specifically, Bessent said they “are well down"" Nvidia's ""technology chips stack.” U.S. companies are banned from selling their most advanced chips to China. That might not be persuasive enough. Teneo's Wildau said China hawks are most worried that the H20 decision could be the beginning of a series of moves to roll back export controls from the Biden era, which were once considered “permanent and non-negotiable.” Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

NFL and ESPN reach nonbinding agreement for sale of NFL Network and other media assets,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/nfl-and-espn-reach-nonbinding-agreement-for-sale-of-nfl-network-and-other-media-assets-2025-08-05/,"Ever since the NFL announced it was looking to sell NFL Network and other media assets, ESPN had been seen as one of the favorites to make a deal. Nearly five years later, a framework is finally in place. The NFL announced Tuesday night that it has entered into a nonbinding agreement with ESPN. Under the terms, ESPN will acquire NFL Network, NFL Fantasy and the rights to distribute the RedZone channel to cable and satellite operators and the league will get a 10% equity stake in ESPN. The league and ESPN still have to negotiate a final agreement and get approval from NFL owners. The agreement will also have to undergo regulatory approvals. “Sometimes great things take a long time to get to the point where it’s right. And we both feel that it is at this stage,” NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a call with The Associated Press. Along with the sale of NFL Network, the NFL and ESPN will have a second nonbinding agreement where the NFL will license to ESPN certain NFL content and other intellectual property that can be used by NFL Network and other assets that have been purchased. “We have been talking about it in earnest for the last few years. But interestingly enough, we started talking about this over a decade ago but nothing really ended up happening. And we got back at it when I came back to Disney after my retirement,” Disney CEO Bob Iger said in a call with the AP. ESPN is expected to launch its direct-to-consumer service before the end of September. The service would give cord-cutters access to all ESPN programs and networks for $29.99 per month. The addition of more NFL programming increases the value. Many viewers will receive the service for free as part of their subscription to cable, satellite and most streaming services. “When I came back to Disney and assessed essentially the future of ESPN, it became clear that ESPN had to launch a bigger and more robust and digital or direct-to-consumer product, not only for the sake of ESPN’s business, but for the sports fan,” Iger said. “And obviously, when you start thinking about high-quality sports content, your eyes immediately head in the direction of the NFL because there’s really nothing more valuable and more popular than that.” NFL Network — which has nearly 50 million subscribers — would be owned and operated by ESPN and would be included in ESPN's direct-to-consumer product. The NFL RedZone channel would be distributed by ESPN to cable and satellite operators. However, the NFL will continue to own, operate and produce the channel as well as retain the rights to distribute the channel digitally. ESPN would also get rights to the RedZone brand, meaning RedZone channels for college football and basketball or other sports could be coming in the future. NFL Fantasy Football would merge with ESPN Fantasy Football, giving ESPN the official fantasy football game of the league. NFL Network will still air seven games per season. Four of ESPN's games, including some that are in overlapping windows on Monday nights, would move to NFL Network. ESPN will license three additional games that will be carried on NFL Network. The league gets a 10% equity stake in ESPN. Aidan O'Connor, a senior vice president at the Prosek Partners marketing firm, estimates the value of that would be $2.2 billion to $2.5 billion. ESPN is currently 80% owned by ABC Inc. as an indirect subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company. The other 20% is owned by Hearst. Once the deal is official and approved, the breakdown of ESPN will be 72% ABC Inc., 18% Hearst and 10% NFL. This isn't the first time the league has had an equity stake in a digital or communications business. It had that in the past with Sirius Satellite Radio and SportsLine. The NFL could also have equity in the newly formed “Paramount Skydance Corporation,” which owns CBS, due to the league's partnership with Skydance. “This is new as far as a partner now operating a business that we built, ran and grew,"" said Hans Schroeder, the NFL’s executive vice president of media distribution. ""It’ll also be a little bit new again with some of the dynamics here, but we’ll continue to balance that in a really arm’s length way where we’ll think about how we manage and work across to all our partners.” The league will continue to own and operate NFL Films, NFL+, NFL.com, the official websites of the 32 teams, the NFL Podcast Network and the NFL FAST Channel (a free ad-supported streaming channel). “The moves align with the NFL’s longstanding ambition to reach $25 billion in annual revenue by 2027 — a target first set in 2010, when league revenue stood at approximately $8.5 billion,” O’Connor said. “Financially, the move also signals to investors that ESPN is doubling down on differentiation and content stickiness by offering a scarce and premium product in a crowded marketplace. Intentionally ceding equity to the NFL transforms ESPN from a media licensee into a true platform partner — with few properties rivaling the league in terms of cultural significance, appointment viewing, audience reach, and monetization efficiency."" Viewers will likely not see any immediate impacts until next year once everything is approved. Besides ESPN, the biggest winner in this could be NFL Network, which had seen reductions in original programming the past couple years. “Total Access,” the network's flagship show since its launch in 2003, ended in May 2024 amid a series of layoffs and cost-cutting moves. “Good Morning Football” also moved from New York, where it had been since its start in 2016, to Southern California last year. NFL Network moved to a broadcast facility across the street from SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, in 2021. “The thing that’s exciting for us is that we have put a lot into the network. I think it’s been very effective for fans. We know it’s in good hands,” Goodell said. “They’re innovative, they recognize great production and know how to produce it. They will do a fantastic job of operating the network and taking it to another level.” ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

Mexican investigators suspect organized crime in killing of a top federal official,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/mexican-investigators-suspect-organized-crime-in-killing-of-a-top-federal-official-2025-08-05/,"CIUDAD VICTORIA, Mexico (AP) — Mexican investigators on Tuesday pointed to organized crime in the killing of a top federal official in the northeastern state of Tamaulipas the previous day, saying it was likely retaliation for the authorities' recent seizures of stolen fuel there. On Monday, gunmen killed Attorney General’s Office Tamaulipas state delegate Ernesto Vásquez Reyna in broad daylight, in the middle of the busiest avenue of the border city of Reynosa. The Attorney General’s Office said in a statement that preliminary information suggested the killing was retaliation by a group it did not name. Images from the scene of the assassination showed a smoldering black SUV and Vásquez Reyna’s body on the pavement. Authorities did not offer details on the attack other than to say that two additional vehicles were involved, and that one of them was recovered. The fuel seizure in July in Reynosa was described as a “great setback” for organized crime. The statement said more than 475,000 gallons (1.8 million liters) of gasoline were seized, along with tanker trucks, pumps and containers for storing the fuel. Reynosa is controlled by a faction of the Gulf cartel known as the “Metros.” Numerous drug cartels have gotten into the business of selling stolen gasoline as another line of illegal revenue.

Unusual Machines: A Speculation With Tailwinds to Lift Its Price,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/unusual-machines-a-speculation-with-tailwinds-to-lift-its-price/,"Unusual Machines NYSEAMERICAN: UMAC has an unusual story with its once-China-based manufacturing returning to the U.S. The critical takeaway is that this leading provider of advanced drone technology, components, and accessories is now an NDAA-compliant manufacturer that can sell to U.S. government agencies and the military. That is an important factor considering the global drone industry's reliance on China and plans for government spending in 2026. The government is increasing its budget in crucial areas, including defense and modernization, which supports this company's outlook. The U.S. drone market outlook remains strong. The market, valued at around $11 billion in 2025, is projected to grow at a steady double-digit CAGR into the next decade. This will lead to nearly a 200% increase in market size, fueled by growth across various end markets, including both commercial and government sectors. The commercial market will be dominated by media, agriculture, inspection, and delivery, a focus of Unusual Machines. The outlook for Unusual Machines is more robust. With its products supported by government spending, new approvals, an expanding product line, and accelerating use-case growth, the forecast is for hyper-growth, which is likely to be low. Currently, analysts tracked by MarketBeat predict revenue will grow by at least 100% in 2026 and maintain a nearly triple-digit growth rate for the upcoming years. Profitability is also projected and is expected to be achieved by the end of this decade. The institutional and analyst trends are not robust, with the first group owning less than 5% of the stock as of early August, and the other includes only two ratings, but they are bullish. The institutions have been buying on balance since the IPO, and the analysts rate the stock unanimously as a Buy. They see this market advancing by at least 100% from the early August support levels and may also be cautious in their forecasts. The hurdle is the short-sellers. The short-sellers focus on UMAC’s fundamentals and capital needs, capping gains in 2025. The latest data shows short-interest increasing steadily from Q1 to Q3, reaching a record high of 15% in early August. Among the reasons is the company’s decision to sell more shares. Unusual Machines sold another five million shares in July, raising nearly $50 million in capital and further diluting shareholder value. Share sales before the July announcement decreased the count by 162% at the end of the first fiscal quarter. Although there is a risk of further dilution, the balance sheet remains solid. The company’s share sales should leave it with over $50 million in cash at the end of the current quarter, enough for several years at the Q1 cash burn rate, and it has no significant debt. The total liability is roughly 0.2X the Q1 quarter-ending cash, leaving the business in a flexible financial position. Unusual Machines' stock price action suggests it is set to pop when the FQ2 earnings report is released. The market shows the influence of short-sellers, but also demonstrates strong support at the $5 level and increasing support over time. The action in early August is mixed, but it supports an uptrending market and only needs a catalyst to spark another wave of buying. The forecast for Q2 is for another significant year-over-year gain, but for business to slow compared to Q1, which is unlikely given the demand trends. The likely scenario is that Unusual Machines will reveal better-than-forecasted results and provide a favorable outlook, sparking another upswing in the share price when it does.

Zebra Technologies: Riding the Automation Wave to Profits,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/zebra-technologies-riding-the-automation-wave-to-profits/,"Zebra Technologies' NASDAQ: ZBRA stock price advanced following the Q2 earnings release to confirm a market reversal and increase the odds it will set a fresh high soon. The company is well-positioned to benefit from automation and AI, and the results reflect it. The company’s remote and data-capture products assist front-line workers, improving efficiency and accuracy to drive revenue and profits for their users. The expansion of 5G networks and the rise of AI-powered computing align with its success, enabling improved functions and aiding the increase in demand. The analysts' activity in June and July was bullish, including numerous price target increases and several upgrades that foreshadowed the Q2 strength. The company’s results affirmed the confidence, which included $1.29 billion in revenue and $3.61 in adjusted EPS, both above the analyst forecasts. The revenue is worth a 6.2% gain compared to last year and 6.3% organically, with growth present in both operating segments. The EVM or Enterprise Visibility and Mobility segment grew by 6.5%, while AIT or Asset Intelligence Tracking grew by a slightly cooler 5.8%. The margin news is better. Tariffs impacted the company’s gross margin, but far less than anticipated, and improved adjusted operating leverage compounded the effect on the bottom line. The adjusted EBITDA margin improved by 10 basis points, a slim improvement to be sure, but sufficient to leave the adjusted EPS at $3.61 or more than 25 cents better than analysts' consensus had forecast and up 13.5% compared to last year. The critical details include the cash flow and free cash flow, which are sufficient to maintain balance sheet health while the company reinvests in growth, and the guidance. Zebra Technologies' guidance is central to the stock price advance. The company improved its outlook for the year, raising the forecasts for revenue and earnings to above the consensus reported by MarketBeat. That alone is sufficient to keep the analysts happy, and the guidance may be cautious. Not only is there a recent acquisition to aid with cost-efficiency, revenue growth, and cross-selling opportunities, but others are in the works. The company announced its intention to buy Elo Touch Solutions. Elo provides touch screens, software, and services globally and is a natural fit for Zebra’s portfolio. Zebra Technologies is primarily self-funding its acquisitions and can continue doing so. At the end of Q2, the balance sheet highlights include a slight reduction in cash and an increase in debt offset by steady assets, reduced total liability, low leverage, and a nearly 1% increase in equity. The Elo Touch solution deal is worth $1.3 billion and will be paid with cash on hand and the revolving credit facility, a debt that will be quickly repaid. Other pertinent details include the company’s ability to repurchase shares while investing in growth. The buybacks aren’t robust, but they reduce the count incrementally each quarter to provide additional leverage for shareholders. The technical action in ZBRA stock is promising. The market exhibited some volatility over the preceding 18 months but appears to have a solid bottom and is in rebound mode in early August. The Q2 results and guidance update sent the market up by more than 5%, extending the rebound with a high-conviction move that set a multi-month high. Assuming the market follows through on the signal, Zebra's stock price should advance to the $400 level by year’s end and potentially move higher in early 2026. The consensus in early August assumes the stock was fairly valued ahead of the release, but the trends are leading to the high-end range and a move above $400.

Vertical Aerospace's New Deal and Earnings De-Risk Production,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/vertical-aerospaces-new-deal-and-earnings-de-risk-production/,"In the first week of August 2025, Vertical Aerospace NYSE: EVTL announced a long-term strategic partnership with Aciturri Aerostructures, a major global supplier with deep roots in the traditional aerospace sector. This news, delivered alongside a stable first-half 2025 financial report, signals a pivotal shift in the company’s evolution. In the competitive race to launch electric air taxis, demonstrating that an aircraft can fly is only the first significant hurdle. The next, arguably more complex challenge, is proving it can be manufactured reliably, affordably, and at scale. Vertical Aerospace is now offering a viable answer to that critical question for investors assessing the long-term potential of the eVTOL sector. The supply chain is as critical as the design for any company developing a new aircraft. Vertical’s agreement with Aciturri is a cornerstone of its manufacturing strategy, designed to mitigate risk and conserve capital. The partnership covers the production of the entire airframe structure. This includes the complex, high-lift wing, the fuselage where passengers will sit, and the pylons that hold the advanced electric propulsion units. By consolidating this massive portion of the supply chain with a single, highly experienced partner, Vertical streamlines its future production process. It reduces the immense execution risk of building a manufacturing operation from the ground up. The choice of partner is a key indicator of the company’s mature approach. Aciturri is a Tier 1 supplier, a term used in aerospace for primary, direct contractors to the original equipment manufacturer (OEM). They are not a startup; Aciturri is a major global supplier with decades of experience building critical components for the biggest names in aviation, including Airbus OTCMKTS: EADSY, Boeing NYSE: BA, and Embraer NYSE: ERJ. This deep industry credibility ensures the VX4’s airframe will be built to the world’s most stringent aerospace standards. Furthermore, Aciturri's experience isn't limited to legacy aircraft; they have also supplied airframes for other eVTOL programs, demonstrating they can bridge the gap between traditional certification requirements and novel electric aviation technology. For investors, this move aligns perfectly with Vertical's stated asset-light business model. Rather than spending hundreds of millions of dollars on its factories and tooling, Vertical is leveraging a world-class partner's expertise and existing infrastructure. This allows the company to focus its own capital and resources on its core strengths: aircraft design, proprietary battery and software integration, and navigating the complex certification process. It is a prudent capital allocation strategy that directly addresses investor concerns about the high cost of bringing a new aircraft to market. A strong manufacturing plan requires an equally strong financial foundation and focus. Vertical Aerospace's first-half 2025 report, released on August 5, demonstrates that the company is maintaining its financial discipline while advancing its crucial technical goals. This two-pronged execution is a key sign of competent management. The company reported a strong cash position of approximately $137 million. This figure, bolstered by the successful $69 million capital raise in July, provides a financial runway extending towards the middle of 2026. This runway is a critical metric for a technology company's pre-revenue, giving investors confidence that the business is funded through its next series of important milestones. More telling for investors watching the company’s spending habits, management maintained its full-year 2025 guidance for net operating cash outflow at approximately $110 million to $125 million. Holding this guidance steady, especially after signing a major new industrial partnership, signals that there have been no unexpected cost overruns and that the company’s budget is under control. This financial discipline was achieved while the core flight program continues to accelerate. The company confirmed its piloted wingborne flight test program has moved forward significantly, with multiple flights now completed by two different test pilots in open European airspace. This shows that the momentum from the historic airport-to-airport flight in July is being actively maintained. Looking ahead, Vertical remains on track to complete the year's final and most technically challenging test phase, the full transition from vertical, helicopter-like lift to efficient, wing-borne forward flight, in the second half of 2025. This parallel progress in finance and flight testing is a key indicator of a well-run organization capable of managing multiple complex workstreams simultaneously. The Aciturri partnership is the latest pillar in a rapidly maturing business strategy. It does not exist in a vacuum but complements the company's recent operational milestones and developing commercial plans. The pieces of a larger, well-thought-out puzzle are falling into place for investors. The flight test program proves the aircraft is capable, a commercial partnership with helicopter operator Bristow establishes a ""Ready-to-Fly"" model for future customers, and the Aciturri deal now provides a credible path to large-scale manufacturing. Strategic additions to its leadership further strengthen this progress. The recent appointment of Lord Andrew Parker, the former head of Britain's MI5, to the board adds significant credibility and high-level access for Vertical's strategy of pursuing high-value defense and government contracts. This avenue, centered on the developing long-range hybrid-electric variant, represents a significant potential revenue stream beyond urban air mobility. For those following Vertical Aerospace, the investment narrative has evolved. The focus is shifting from the early-stage ""Can it fly?"" question to the more mature, business-oriented question of ""How will it be built and sold?"" By methodically signing Tier 1 partners, maintaining financial discipline, and executing on its flight test plans, the company is building a more tangible and robust case for its long-term value.

Ride the Rally: 3 Earnings Winners With More Upside Ahead,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/ride-the-rally-3-earnings-winners-with-more-upside-ahead/,"In the height of earnings season, investors typically watch many of the biggest names across industries for an essential update on how these key businesses—and the broader market—have fared. Only following major firms when it comes to earnings reports may cause an investor to miss out on potential opportunities for gains to be found in lesser-known companies as well. Three niche names, including two small-cap companies and a mid-cap firm, stand out in the second-quarter 2025 earnings season for posting strong results that have attracted informed investors to buy in. Even after these short-term rallies, analysts see the potential for more upside in the near future, meaning it may not be too late to buy in. Modine Manufacturing Co. NYSE: MOD makes a wide variety of thermal management products used in residential and commercial applications, including chillers, heaters, air handling and condensing units, and much more. The company's recent earnings report, which actually coincides with its first quarter of fiscal 2026, brought a 13-cent earnings per share beat and revenue ahead of analyst estimates as well. While Modine's traditional heating and cooling products will likely always have a market, some of its biggest business in recent months has been in the data center area. The firm also builds a line of air conditioning units, coolers, and other thermal control products specifically for data centers. This segment of Modine's business is growing at an impressive pace; the company is aiming for $2 billion in data center revenue by fiscal 2028, while its entire climate solutions segment (including data center products, among others) stood at $1.4 billion in sales for fiscal 2025. Modine is supporting this sales growth with a recently announced $100-million investment to build out manufacturing capacity. Modine has also been executing strategic acquisitions with a high degree of success. Last quarter, its purchases of Absolute Air, L.B. White, and CDI all helped to drive climate solutions revenue growth of 11% year-over-year (YOY). These and potential future acquisitions may aid Modine in achieving its lofty full-year fiscal 2026 outlook of 10-15% YOY revenue growth, recently revised up from 2-10%. MOD shares are up 28% in the last month, with about 7% in additional upside potential projected. A maker of components and systems used in industrial air quality and water treatment applications, CECO Environmental Corp. NASDAQ: CECO also wowed in its latest earnings report. The company beat analyst predictions on both top- and bottom-line performance while boosting both EPS and revenue by 35% YOY and EBITDA by 45% over the same period. CECO's strong performance is likely due to rising demand for environmental solutions and CECO's increased capacity to meet that demand, thanks to its expansion into Saudi Arabia and ongoing growth across the Middle East and Asia. Owing to its broad array of products and services, CECO has business opportunities in a number of fast-growing spaces, including power generation, semiconductor, and natural gas infrastructure. This has driven a 40% CAGR since 2021 to the company's sales opportunity pipeline, which currently sits at $5.5 billion. Backlog is also growing rapidly, having reached $688 million in the latest quarter thanks to $274 million in new bookings. That's three-quarters higher than the same figure last year. With all of this growth, it's unsurprising that CECO management raised the company's forward guidance. The company now expects $725–775 million in revenue for the full year. CECO shares are up an impressive 50.4% in the last month, but analysts see the possibility of another 9% upside. Expro Group Holdings N.V. NYSE: XPRO provides energy services including well construction, drilling, tubular running, and more. Like the firms above, Expro also topped predictions for both EPS and revenue for the latest quarter, as revenue in particular climbed 8% YOY despite unpredictability in the energy sector more broadly. Expro's advantage lies in part in its massive reach, as the company serves clients in dozens of countries throughout the world. Thus, when demand increases in a particular area, the firm is prepared to meet it quickly—this is evidenced in the latest quarter by $595 million in new awards, including major new projects in Guyana and North Africa. The firm also distinguishes itself for its cutting-edge technology, including both remote clamp insulation and a fully remote cementing system launched in recent months, among others. The company's guidance is strong, and it expects about $1.7 billion in full-year revenue and 7% free cash flow thanks to its international business. It also plans to engage in a share buyback campaign to return about $40 million to shareholders in the coming months. XPRO shares are up nearly 17% in the last month, with more than 16% in additional upside possible. Before you consider Modine Manufacturing, you'll want to hear this.

Crucial exemption allows majority of Canadian and Mexican goods to be shipped to US without tariffs,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/crucial-exemption-allows-majority-of-canadian-and-mexican-goods-to-be-shipped-to-us-without-tariffs-2025-08-05/,"TORONTO (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump raised the tariffs on Canadian goods to 35% last week, but a key exemption for Canada and Mexico shields the vast majority of goods from the punishing duties. Goods that comply with the 2020 United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement that Trump negotiated during his first term are excluded from the tariffs. Here's a look at Trump's tariffs on the two countries and their exemptions: Canada’s central bank says 100% of energy exports and 95% of other exports are compliant with the trade pact, known as USMCA. The Royal Bank estimated that almost 90% of Canadian exports appear to have accessed the U.S. market duty free in April. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said the commitment of the U.S. to the core of USMCA, reaffirmed again last week, means the U.S. average tariff rate on Canadian goods remains one of its lowest, and over 85% of Canada-U.S. trade continues to be tariff free. “Canada is better off than any of the trading partners right now because the Americans appear to be relying as a default on USMCA,” said Flavio Volpe, president of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers’ Association. “That gives them the tough tariff headline but also allows them the access to the stuff they need from us. Because of that we’re in a relative better position.” Canadian and Mexican companies can claim preferential treatment under the USMCA based on where the products are made. “The headline news is 35% tariffs but it’s somewhat targeted,” said John Manley, Canada’s former industry minister, finance minister, foreign affairs minister and deputy prime minister. Manley said Canada is doing okay despite the economic uncertainty. “There is a lot of resilience I’d say. The Canadian economy has done relatively well, better than most of us expected, and remember that there is no tariffs on any of our energy exports,"" he said. Trump said last week he would enter into a 90-day negotiating period with Mexico, also one of America's largest trading partners. The current 25% tariff rates are staying in place, down from the 30% he had threatened earlier. But that 25% only applies to the fraction of Mexico's trade with the U.S. that isn't covered by the USMCA. Shortly after speaking with Trump on Thursday, President Claudia Sheinbaum said that within the “new commercial world order,” Mexico was still the best positioned nation because of the free trade agreement. “What’s within (USMCA) has no tariff, with the exception of what we already know: autos, steel and aluminum; and what is outside the treaty has 25%,” Sheinbaum said. But Economy Secretary Marcelo Ebrard pointed out that under the USMCA no tariffs were paid on more than 84% of Mexico's trade with the United States. Most imports from Canada and Mexico are still protected by the USMCA, but the deal is up for review next year. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said last month: “I think the president is absolutely going to renegotiate USMCA."" Preserving the free trade pact will be critical for Canada and Mexico. “It would be an incredible disruption to lose it especially if you lost it to the levels of tariffs Trump is imposing, 30%, 25% or even 20%. You can absorb a single digit tariff level across the board but you can’t adjust that kind of increase,” Manley said. More than 75% of Canada's exports go to the U.S. while more than 80% of Mexico's exports go there. Manley said that depending on how the trade war plays out the risk to the USMCA is very high. “Uncertainty in business is the enemy of decision making,"" he said. Carney said in a series of recent agreements with other countries that America is, in effect, charging for access to its economy. Manley said the investment thesis for Canada is pretty straightforward as Canada is rich in natural resources, has a skilled labor force, is open to immigration and has unfettered access to the U.S. market, the largest economy in the world. “If that latter point is no longer the case, we’ve still got all the others, but we’ve got to really redevelop the investment thesis for attracting investment to Canada,” Manley said. Trump has some sector specific tariffs, known as 232 tariffs, that are having an impact. There is a 50% tariff on steel and aluminum imports and a 25% tariff on auto imports, though there is a carve-out for Canadian and Mexican made cars. “Despite our advantages, certain major Canadian industries are being severely impacted by U.S. trade actions. These strategic sectors include autos, steel, aluminum, copper, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and of course, softwood lumber,” Carney said on Tuesday as he announced an aid package for the lumber industry as the U.S, ratches up duties. “It is clear we cannot count or fully rely on what has been our most valued trading relationship for our prosperity,” he added. ___ Associated Press writer Fabiola Sánchez in Mexico City contributed to this report.

"Tips to help manage your buy now, pay later loans",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/tips-to-help-manage-your-buy-now-pay-later-loans-2025-08-05/,"NEW YORK (AP) — Between rising prices and dwindling job growth, using “buy now, pay later” on everything from concert tickets to fast food deliveries is becoming increasingly appealing. But greater use could also mean greater trouble, as more people fall behind on repaying these loans. Buy now, pay later loans gained popularity during the pandemic, especially among young people. While these loans can help you make large purchases without paying interest or undergoing a hard inquiry in your credit report, they can also easily be overused. About 4 in 10 Americans under the age of 45 say they’ve used ""buy now, pay later″ services when spending on entertainment or restaurant meals, or when paying for essentials like groceries or medical care, according to a poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Buy now, pay later loans were not previously reported to the three major credit reporting bureaus. But consumers will soon see the impact of buy now, pay later loans on their FICO credit scores. Whether you’re a first-time or recurring user of buy now, pay later plans, here are some expert recommendations to use this tool responsibly. Buy now, pay later plans divide purchases in monthly installments, typically in four payments. These loans are marketed as having low or no interest. Klarna, Afterpay, PayPal and Affirm are among the most popular buy now, pay later companies. These loans should ideally be used for large purchases or necessities, said Lauren Bringle, Accredited Financial Counselor at Self Financial. Bringle recommends asking yourself these questions before purchasing: Can I survive without this purchase right now? Do I need it for work, school, or a basic household need? Buy now, pay later is best used when you have a plan for the purchase, not for impulse buys. For example, when you need to buy a computer for school or a new refrigerator for your house, recommended Tyler Horn, head of planning at Origin, a budgeting app. Before deciding to take out a buy now, pay later loan, it’s a good idea to pause and consider if it’s the best financial decision for you, recommended Erika Rasure, Chief Financial Wellness advisor for Beyond Finance. Buy now, pay later plans can be positive budgeting tools when used strategically. However, it’s essential you know your spending behaviors before using them, said Rasure. If you’re an emotional spender, it might be hard for you to moderate your use of this tool and you could end up adding to your financial stress. “Buy now, pay later can become a coping mechanism rather than a financial tool that can get you a good deal or improve your cash flow,” said Rasure. If you have other payments due, such as credit card or student loan payments, consider how a buy now, pay later loan will add to your monthly payments, recommended Sarah Rathner, Senior Writer for NerdWallet. Like credit cards, each buy now, pay later loan has terms and conditions that can vary by purchase and providers. It’s crucial that you know what you’re agreeing to before you sign up, recommended Michael Savino, Chief Lending Officer at Municipal Credit Union. “Always read the fine print. Understand fees, repayment schedules, and what happens if you miss a payment or go into default,” said Savino. In general, if you miss a buy now, pay later payment, you can face fees, interest, or the possibility of being banned from using the services in the future. You can easily run into difficulty keeping up with the cost and schedule of your repayments if you're trying to simultaneously pay off two, three or more loans, Savino said. “Juggling multiple plans creates a blind spot and overall debt load, and multiple repayment dates are hard to manage,” Savino said. ""So more loans makes it more difficult to budget.” The best approach: Stay mindful of your overall spending, and limit the number of buy now, pay later loans. Whether or not you're paying for multiple buy now, pay later purchases at once, you want to be aware of where your money is going at any given time, recommended Courtney Alev, consumer advocate at Credit Karma. “Buy now, pay later often requires automatic payments, so you want to make sure that your account is funded so that those payments are processing successfully,” recommended Jennifer Seitz, director of education at Greenlight, a financial literacy app for families. There are many ways to track your loan payments — from setting a reminder on your calendar, to creating an intricate excel spreadsheet or tracking them on an app, said Jesse Mecham, founder of the budgeting app YNAB. Finding the best method that works for you will help you stay on track and avoid late fees. For shoppers with low credit scores or no credit history, buy now, pay later loans can seem like the best, if not the only, loan option. If used moderately and responsibly, these short-term loans can be a positive lending exercise, said Savino. “It allows you to to establish a baseline (and) get access to other affordable credit options that you can leverage that will ultimately provide financial wellness,” he added. Still, NerdWallet's Rathner emphasized that shoppers using these tools always remember that buy now, pay later is a form of borrowing money. “It just kind of feels like you’re given a little extra time to pay back,"" Rathner said. ""But the reality is, if you miss payments, it can hurt your credit, much like missing payments with any other loan.” —— The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

"Trump narrows Fed chair candidates to four, excluding Treasury Secretary Bessent",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-narrows-fed-chair-candidates-to-four-excluding-treasury-secretary-bessent-2025-08-05/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Tuesday that he's whittled down his list of potential Federal Reserve chair candidates to four as he considers a successor to Jerome Powell — a choice that could reset the path of the U.S. economy. Asked on CNBC's “Squawk Box” for a future replacement for Powell, Trump named Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, and Kevin Warsh, a former member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. “I think Kevin and Kevin, both Kevins, are very good,” Trump said. He said two other people were also under consideration, but Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is not among them. “I love Scott, but he wants to stay where he is,"" Trump said. He did not name his other two top candidates but used the opportunity to disparage Powell, whom he has dubbed “too late” in cutting interest rates. The news that Trump plans to make a decision on the Fed chair “soon” comes as the Republican president has been highly critical of Powell, whose term ends in May 2026. Trump recently floated having the Fed's board of governors take full control of the U.S. central bank from Powell, whom he has relentlessly pressured to cut short-term interest rates in ways that raise questions about whether the Fed can remain free from White House politicking. Trump has openly mused about whether to remove Powell before his tenure as chair ends, but he's held off on dismissing the Fed chair after a recent Supreme Court ruling suggested he could only do so for cause rather than out of policy disagreements. The president has put pressure on Powell by claiming he mismanaged the Fed's $2.5 billion renovation project, but he's also said that he's “highly unlikely” to fire Powell. One of the Fed's governors, Adriana Kugler, made a surprise announcement last Friday that she would be stepping away from her role. That created an opening for Trump, who called her departure “a pleasant surprise,” to name a new Fed governor. Trump told CNBC it's “a possibility” that his pick to replace Kugler could also be his choice to replace Powell. Trump told reporters that he plans to name his pick to join the Fed's board of governors soon, though he is deciding whether he’ll nominate someone to permanently join the board and possibly succeed Powell or simply serve out the remaining months of Kugler's term. “I’ll be making that decision before the end of the week,” Trump said later Tuesday when asked about his Fed governor pick. Here’s what to know about the two known candidates: Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, has been supportive of the president's agenda — from his advocacy for income tax cuts and tariffs to his support of the recent firing of BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer. Hassett served in the first Trump administration as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. He has a doctoral degree in economics from the University of Pennsylvania and worked at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute before joining the Trump White House in 2017. As part of Hassett’s farewell announcement in 2019, Trump called him a “true friend” who did a “great job.” Hassett became a fellow at the Hoover Institution, which is located at Stanford University. He later returned to the administration to help deal with the pandemic. On CNBC on Monday, Hassett said “all over the U.S. government, there have been people who have been resisting Trump everywhere they can."" A former Fed governor who stepped down in 2011, Warsh is currently a fellow at the Hoover Institution. He has been supportive of cutting interest rates, a key goal of Trump’s. “The president’s right to be frustrated with Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve,” Warsh said on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures” last month. Warsh has been increasingly critical of Powell’s Federal Reserve and in July, on CNBC, called for sweeping changes on how the Fed conducts business as well as a new Treasury-Fed accord “like we did in 1951, after another period where we built up our nation’s debt and we were stuck with a central bank that was working at cross purposes with the Treasury.” He said the Fed’s “hesitancy to cut rates, I think, is actually quite a mark against them.” “The specter of the miss they made on inflation"" after the pandemic, he said, ""it has stuck with them. So one of the reasons why the president, I think, is right to be pushing the Fed publicly is we need regime change in the conduct of policy.” “He’s very highly thought of,” Trump said in June when asked directly about Warsh. ___ Associated Press writers Josh Boak and Christopher Rugaber in Washington contributed to this report.

California marijuana grower said 9 employees were among hundreds detained in immigration raid,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/california-marijuana-grower-said-9-employees-were-among-hundreds-detained-in-immigration-raid-2025-08-05/,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — California's biggest legal marijuana grower said nine of its employees were detained in a federal immigration raid last month that netted hundreds of arrests, and that the business has ended its relationship with two labor contractors that supplied its farmworkers. The statement came nearly a month after federal authorities raided Glass House’s farms in Camarillo and Carpinteria, northwest of Los Angeles, and arrested about 360 people. Federal officials characterized the raids as one of the largest immigration operations since President Donald Trump took office in January. In Camarillo, armored vehicles blocked the road outside while demonstrators faced off with federal agents who fired tear gas to disperse them. Inside, one farmworker fell from a greenhouse roof while running to hide from authorities and later died from his injuries. Glass House Brands said in a statement it was served a federal search warrant at its two farms for an investigation into suspected immigration violations. After the raid, federal authorities said agents found 14 immigrant children on the Camarillo property and that it was investigating potential child labor, human trafficking and other abuse. The company didn't confirm that minors were at the site and said none of the nine employees were teens. Glass House said it worked with farm labor contractors that were required to ensure workers were at least 21 years old, in line with California’s marijuana-growing regulations. “Any other individuals detained or arrested would have been either employees of third-party contractors providing services at the Company’s Camarillo farm,” Glass House said in a statement on Monday, adding that it is now working with other contractors. The company said it also hired consultants to assist with determining the employment eligibility of its employees and those of its contractors. The operation came more than a month into an extended immigration crackdown across Southern California that was originally centered in Los Angeles. Online court records don’t show any federal charges filed against Glass House. Messages seeking comment were left with the U.S. Attorney’s office in Los Angeles and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. It is legal to grow and sell cannabis in California with proper licensing. State records showed Glass House had multiple active licenses to cultivate cannabis at the time of the raids.

A former Rolling Stone says the Met has his stolen guitar. The museum disputes it,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/a-former-rolling-stone-says-the-met-has-his-stolen-guitar-the-museum-disputes-it-2025-08-05/,"LONDON (AP) — It’s only rock ‘n’ roll, but it’s messy. A guitar once played by two members of the Rolling Stones is at the center of a dispute between the band’s former guitarist Mick Taylor and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The 1959 Gibson Les Paul was donated to the Met as part of what the New York museum calls “a landmark gift of more than 500 of the finest guitars from the golden age of American guitar making.” The donor is Dirk Ziff, a billionaire investor and guitar collector. When the Met announced the gift in May, Taylor thought he recognized the guitar, with its distinctive “starburst” finish, as an instrument he last saw in 1971, when the Stones were recording the album “Exile on Main St.” at Keith Richards’ rented villa in the south of France. In the haze of drugs and rock ‘n’ roll that pervaded the sessions, a number of instruments went missing, believed stolen. Now, Taylor and his team believe it has reappeared. The Met says provenance records show no evidence the guitar ever belonged to Taylor. “This guitar has a long and well-documented history of ownership,” museum spokesperson Ann Bailis said. Taylor’s partner and business manager, Marlies Damming, said the Met should make the guitar “available for inspection.” “An independent guitar expert should be able to ascertain the guitar’s provenance one way or the other,” she said in a statement Tuesday to The Associated Press. While its ownership is contested, there’s no disputing the instrument’s starring role in rock history. It was owned in the early 1960s by Keith Richards, who played it during the Rolling Stones’ first appearance on “The Ed Sullivan Show” in 1964. The Met says that performance “ignited interest in this legendary model.” The guitar – nicknamed the “Keithburst” – was also played by guitar legends Eric Clapton and Jimmy Page. Taylor says he got it from Richards in 1967, two years before he joined the Stones, replacing original member Brian Jones. Jones died in 1969. Taylor left the band in 1974, reuniting with them for the Stones' 50th anniversary tour in 2012-2013. Jeff Allen, who was Taylor’s manager and publicist for decades from the 1990s, said Taylor “told me he got it as a present from Keith,” and also mentioned the theft. “Mick did tell me that the guitar solo that he became quite famous for, on ‘Can’t You Hear Me Knocking,’ was with the Les Paul that got stolen,” Allen said. The Met’s records say the Les Paul was owned by Richards until 1971, when it was acquired by record producer and manager Adrian Miller, who died in 2006. The guitar has changed hands several times since then, and reappeared twice in public. It was put up for auction by Christie’s in 2004, when it failed to sell. Ziff bought it in 2016, and loaned it to the Met in 2019 for an exhibition titled “Play it Loud: Instruments of Rock & Roll.” It's unclear what will happen next. The Met, which plans to open a new gallery dedicated to its collection of American guitars, says it has not been contacted by Taylor or his representatives. ___ Associated Press writer Jocelyn Noveck in New York contributed to this story.

A $2.5 billion pledge makes women’s health a priority in Gates Foundation spend-down,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/a-25-billion-pledge-makes-womens-health-a-priority-in-gates-foundation-spend-down-2025-08-05/,"Innovations on the horizon in women’s health show what’s possible with more investment. With the help of ultrasound equipment powered by artificial intelligence, frontline health care workers may be able to track the progress of developing embryos with a minimum of training. And birth control injections that last six months could give women more control over reproduction. Those are just two potential breakthroughs out of more than 40 the Gates Foundation intends to support through a five-year, $2.5 billion commitment on women’s health research and development, more than triple the amount it has spent on women’s health innovation over the past five years. “Many of the most pressing conditions impacting women still remain understudied, underdiagnosed, and overlooked,” said Ru-fong Joanne Cheng, director of Women’s Health Innovations at Gates. A very small share of medical research funding supports the study of health specific to women, including gynecological and menstrual health, obstetric care, contraceptive innovation, sexually transmitted infections, and maternal health and nutrition, the foundation said. It cited a 2021 McKinsey and Company study that found 1% of all medical research, setting aside cancer research, goes toward women’s health. The foundation framed the commitment as part of its May announcement that it would spend down its assets over the next 20 years and concentrate much of its support on global health. While much of the research funded over the next five years will benefit women worldwide, the foundation said, the need is most acute in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. By devoting billions to women’s health, the foundation has signaled it intends to continue to invest in the cause following the 2024 departure of Melinda French Gates, who led the foundation’s support of girls’ and women’s health. Since her divorce from Bill Gates, French Gates has committed more than $1 billion to improve women’s physical and mental health, provide more economic opportunity to women, and increase their political sway. The announcement follows a U.S. pullback of support for global maternal health programs during the first seven months of the Trump administration. The shuttering of the U.S. Agency for International Development and program reductions at the Centers for Disease Control have sunset programs focused on women’s health. According to a March internal USAID memo, the agency’s closure will stop services for 16.8 million pregnant women annually. In April, the World Health Organization said that the 40 percent decline in maternal deaths from 2000 to 2023 has been put at risk because of aid cuts. While the foundation continues to focus on the delivery of health care globally in an era of governmental retreat, the $2.5 billion will focus squarely on research needed to save lives, Anita Zaidi, president of Gates’s Gender Equality Division, said on a press call Monday to discuss the announcement. “This is an innovation-focused announcement,” she said. “We need both innovation and delivery.” It’s important to remember that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has only been required to test novel drugs on women in clinical trials since 1993, and many tests are still only done on men, said Katy Brodsky Falco, founder of the Foundation for Women’s Health, which plans to make $5 million in research grants this year. With Gates getting behind research and development of women’s health with such a large commitment, others may follow, Brodsky Falco said. “Hopefully it will bring the issue to the top of the conversation among private donors and family foundations, even if they otherwise haven’t supported this type of work,” she said. Moses Obimbo Madadi, professor at the University of Nairobi, noted that postpartum hemorrhaging causes about 3,000 deaths annually in Kenya. If men were the victims, he said, a G7 conference would be called to find a solution, but research on the subject has largely been ignored because it claims the lives of women. “We’ve treated this as a peripheral issue other than making it a centerpiece of our research,” he said, calling the Gates commitment a “very good starting point.” _____ Alex Daniels is a senior reporter at the Chronicle of Philanthropy, where you can read the full article.

Trump administration dismisses all Democrats on a federal board overseeing Puerto Rico's finances,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/the-trump-administration-dismisses-most-on-a-federal-board-overseeing-puerto-ricos-finances-2025-08-05/,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — The Trump administration has dismissed five out of seven members on Puerto Rico’s federal control board that oversees the U.S. territory’s finances, sparking concern about the future of the island’s fragile economy. The five fired are all Democrats. A White House official told The Associated Press on Tuesday that the board “has been run inefficiently and ineffectively by its governing members for far too long and it’s time to restore common sense leadership.” Those fired are board chairman Arthur Gonzalez, along with Cameron McKenzie, Betty Rosa, Juan Sabater and Luis Ubiñas. The board’s two remaining members — Andrew G. Biggs and John E. Nixon — are Republicans. The board confirmed in a brief statement that the five were terminated and noted that the board would continue to fulfill its mandate and work “in the interest of the people of Puerto Rico.” Sylvette Santiago, a spokesperson for the board, did not immediately return a message seeking comment on whether the board members would fight the decision. Meanwhile, Rep. Nydia Velázquez, a New York Democrat, criticized the dismissals though she acknowledged what she said were “serious and longstanding concerns” about actions the board has taken, including implementing austerity measures. “This sudden purge by Donald Trump is not about justice or reform,"" she said in a statement. ""It simply creates an opening to stack the Board with even more extreme, pro-bondholder appointees who will continue to put the needs of hedge funds over the Puerto Rican people.” The board was created in 2016 under the Obama administration, a year after Puerto Rico’s government declared it was unable to pay its more than $70 billion public debt load and later filed for the biggest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. In remarks to the AP, the White House official claimed the board had operated ineffectively and in secret and said it “shelled out huge sums to law, consulting and lobbying firms.” The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the subject, also accused the board’s staff of receiving “exorbitant salaries.” Puerto Rico is struggling to restructure more than $9 billion in debt held by the state’s Electric Power Authority, with officials holding bitter mediations with creditors demanding full payment. It’s the only Puerto Rico government debt pending a restructuring, with the White House official accusing the board of preferring to “extend the bankruptcy.” In February, the board’s executive director, Robert Mujica Jr., said it was “impossible” for Puerto Rico to pay the $8.5 billion that bondholders are demanding. He instead unveiled a new fiscal plan that proposed a $2.6 billion payment for creditors. The plan does not call for any rate increases for an island that has one of the highest power bills in any U.S. jurisdiction as chronic power outages persist, given the grid’s weak infrastructure. Alvin Velázquez, a bankruptcy law professor at Indiana University, said he worries the dismissal of the board members could spark another crisis in Puerto Rico. “This is really about getting a deal out of (the power company) that is not sustainable for the rate payers of Puerto Rico,” he said. Velázquez, former chair for the unsecured creditors committee during the bankruptcy proceedings, also questioned if the dismissals are legal, since board members can only be removed for just cause. “What’s the cause?” he said. “What you’re going to see is another instance in which the Trump administration is taking on and testing the courts.” The dismissals were first reported by the Breitbart News Network, a conservative news site.

Applied Digital: Why a Surge in Bullish Bets Signals a New Era,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/applied-digital-why-a-surge-in-bullish-bets-signals-a-new-era/,"Most investors will tell you that it pays to listen when the market sends a clear signal. On August 1, 2025, the market for Applied Digital Corporation NASDAQ: APLD was practically shouting. On that day, the volume of call options traded for the company surged 220.9% over its daily average, a spike in activity that caught the attention of Wall Street. This market action points directly to a powerful story unfolding within the company: Applied Digital's fundamental transformation into an essential infrastructure provider for the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. For a growing number of investors, this is a clear sign that the company is standing at a much-anticipated turning point, and they are beginning to position themselves accordingly. The confidence displayed by options traders is rooted in Applied Digital’s successful strategic pivot away from its history of hosting for the volatile cryptocurrency mining industry. The company is aggressively remaking itself into what can best be described as an AI Landlord. Instead of speculating on technology, Applied Digital is building and leasing out the essential, high-value digital real estate required by the titans of the AI revolution. This picks and shovels business model is incredibly attractive because it offers a durable way to invest in the entire AI boom, backed by physical assets and predictable, long-term rental income, much like a commercial real estate owner with a blue-chip anchor tenant. This strategy is cemented by a landmark agreement with CoreWeave NASDAQ: CRWV, a prominent private AI Hyperscaler backed by industry leader NVIDIA NASDAQ: NVDA. This single partnership validates Applied Digital’s new identity and provides the hard evidence for the bullish investment case. The scale of the deal, which was recently expanded, is immense: This agreement provides an unprecedented level of revenue visibility for a company of Applied Digital’s size, transforming its financial future. For investors, this contract is the cornerstone of the bullish thesis and the primary reason traders are re-evaluating what the company is truly worth. An $11 billion contract is only valuable if a company can deliver on it. The central question for investors has now shifted from strategy to execution, and Applied Digital's management is taking clear and decisive steps to de-risk its ambitious construction plan. These actions directly address investor concerns and are aimed at ensuring the contracted revenue becomes a reality. First, the company has fortified its financial position. Building data centers is a capital-intensive business, and Applied Digital has proactively strengthened its balance sheet. Following its fiscal year-end earnings report, the company raised approximately $270 million in new capital, providing a significant cash buffer for construction. Management also stated on its July 30 earnings call that it expects to finalize the broader project financing for the campus within weeks, which would secure the long-term funding required for the entire build-out. Second, the company is accelerating its operational timeline. By streamlining its design and supply chain, management has successfully reduced projected datacenter build times from 24 months down to an impressive 12 to 14 months. This efficiency not only speeds up the timeline to revenue generation but also demonstrates a high level of operational expertise that can be a key competitive advantage. This visible progress is why the market is beginning to re-evaluate the stock’s potential. When comparing Applied Digital’s full-year 2025 revenue of $144.2 million to its now massive $11 billion revenue backlog, the step-change in the company’s financial scale becomes clear. This forward-looking sentiment is being echoed by Applied Digital’s analyst community, with several analyst firms, including Lake Street Capital and Needham & Company, significantly raising their price targets on the stock, with some targets now reaching as high as $18.00. The explosive surge in call options is a powerful market signal that a growing number of investors are looking past Applied Digital's history and are squarely focused on its future as a key enabler of the AI industry. With its foundational $11 billion contract secured and clear, tangible steps being taken to de-risk the execution phase, the company is poised to become an essential landlord to some of the most important companies in technology. The bet being made by a growing number of traders is clear: Applied Digital is poised to flip the switch, not just on its new data centers, but on a new era of predictable growth, profitability, and significant value creation for its shareholders.

Palantir Stock Soars After Blowout Earnings Report,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/palantir-stock-soars-after-blowout-earnings-report/,"Palantir Technologies Inc. NASDAQ: PLTR is up over 8% the morning after the company delivered a blowout earnings report that had shareholders cheering and, for a moment, quieted its naysayers. There were many headlines to this report, but the most important was that Palantir hit $1 billion in revenue for a quarter for the first time. That was a 48% increase on a year-over-year (YOY) basis. The company also beat earnings expectations by three cents. Some additional highlights in the company’s report included: The bullish enthusiasm wasn’t just about the current earnings report. Chief executive officer (CEO) Alex Karp remarked that he’s committed to the company growing its revenue by 10x over the next five years. That was the message Karp shared with what he called the “Palantir haters” in an interview with CNBC. It’s easy to understand why Karp would celebrate a victory. The reasonable, but perhaps overstated, criticism of Palantir is that the stock is priced to perfection and then some. However, as the saying goes, it’s not bragging if you can do it. That’s exactly what Palantir continues to do. The report, by any objective measure, was spectacular. However, more importantly, the company’s forward guidance signals that it will continue to grow. In fact, referring to the “bombastic demand” for the company’s AI platform, Karp noted that the company is “growing faster than we are even able to grow, like we’re going to have to start turning away people...” The company isn’t turning away the federal government. In fact, Palantir announced that it has $10 billion in contracts with the government over the next 10 years. It’s common for analysts to reevaluate a company’s rating and price target after an earnings report. One of the most prominent Palantir bulls, Dan Ives of Wedbush, raised his price target on PLTR stock from $175 to $200. Investors will recall that Ives has referred to Palantir as the “Lionel Messi of AI.” Ives isn’t alone. Deutsche Bank upgraded Palantir from a Sell to a Hold while doubling its price target from $80 to $160. Cantor Fitzgerald and Piper Sandler also raised their price targets for PLTR stock. Seeing price targets move higher is encouraging. This is important for several reasons. First, it demonstrates that institutions are still buying Palantir stock, despite its high valuation. Second, it shows that retail investors continue to hold their shares, even while high. Technology stocks historically carry a premium valuation. However, Palantir is expensive by any measure, and the debate about Palantir’s valuation isn’t going to go away anytime soon. However, it’s important to note that many investors who passively add money to their 401(k) funds may already have exposure to PLTR stock. For example, PLTR stock is the 28th largest holding of the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF NYSEARCA: VOO as of this writing. However, this may not provide enough exposure for growth investors, who may require a more active approach. In this case, investors with a long-term focus on the company’s valuation can scale into the stock over time. Before you consider Palantir Technologies, you'll want to hear this.

US government proposes easing some restrictions on drones traveling long distances,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/us-government-proposes-easing-some-restrictions-on-drones-traveling-long-distances-2025-08-05/,"A new federal rule proposed Tuesday would make it easier for companies to use drones over longer distances out of the operator's sight without having to go through a cumbersome waiver process. The federal government had already approved 657 waivers to allow companies such as Amazon and major utilities to do this in certain circumstances, but the waiver process made it difficult. The rule would establish a clear process for drone operators to seek approval for using drones this way. The industry has long pressed for the rule because being able to operate drones out of sight opens up a multitude of possibilities for their use. Being able to do this enables more use of drones for deliveries, inspecting infrastructure like bridges and power lines and other uses in agriculture like spraying fertilizer over thousands of acres on large farms. “This draft rule is a critical step toward enabling drone operations that will enhance safety, transform commercial services, and strengthen public safety with drones as a force multiplier,"" Michael Robbins, president & CEO of the Association for Uncrewed Vehicle Systems International trade group, said in a statement. The rule spells out the circumstances drones can be used. These out of sight flights will only be allowed under 400 feet, and there are precautions to ensure they don't disrupt aviation and cause problems around airports, Federal Aviation Administration Administrator Bryan Bedford said. The drones will be required to have collision-avoidance technology to keep them away from planes and other drones. And the rule will only allow drones up to 1,320 pounds — including their payloads. “The issue hasn’t been that America just can’t innovate, America can’t create, America can’t build amazing drone technology. It’s that we’ve had a bureaucracy in place that makes it incredibly incredibly difficult for innovators to actually innovate,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said. The rules are designed to address the way modern drones are being used today. “While the technology has rapidly advanced over the last decade, our regulatory framework in the United States has failed to keep pace,” said Lisa Ellman, CEO of the Commercial Drone Alliance group. “Drone operators must navigate a labyrinth of ill-suited regulations designed for crewed aircraft.” President Donald Trump issued executive orders in June directing the Transportation Department to quickly get this rule out. The orders also included restrictions meant to help protect against terrorism, espionage and public safety threats. Drones are already used in a variety of ways, including bolstering search and rescue operations, applying fertilizer, inspecting power lines and railroad bridges, and even delivering packages. Amazon is one of the companies that received a waiver allowing it to use drones this way for some of its deliveries in College Station, Texas, as it develops the technology. This rule should make it easier for Amazon and other companies to get approval to use drones this way in more communities. Flytrex, a Tel Aviv-based drone delivery company that has operations in Texas and North Carolina, said it was excited to see the proposed rule take shape. Flytrex co-founder and CEO Yariv Bash called the proposed rule “a foundational milestone that paves the way for drone delivery to scale across more communities in the U.S.” “This rule is a critical step toward unlocking the full potential of drone delivery and ensuring its long-term business viability nationwide,” Bash said. The war in Ukraine has highlighted how drones could be used in a military or terrorist attack — a concern as the World Cup and Olympics approach in the U.S. There also have been espionage cases where drones have been used to surveil sensitive sites. And White House officials said drones are being used to smuggle drugs over the border, and there are concerns about the potential for a disastrous collision between a drone and an airliner around an airport. The rule won't allow drone flights over large open-air gatherings like concerts or sporting events or crowded parks. The FAA consulted with the Department of Homeland Security as it developed this rule to make sure security concerns are addressed. The government will accept comments on the new rule over the next 60 days before finalizing the rule likely sometime later this year. Drone operators will have to go through background checks and be certified to operate drones out of their sight. Duffy and Bedford said they hope having regulations in place can help prevent problems like earlier this year when a small drone collided with a “Super Scooper” plane that was fighting wildfires raging through Southern California. The drone punched a hole in the plane’s left wing, causing enough damage that officials grounded the aircraft for several days to make repairs. Authorities tracked down the 56-year-old drone operator, who pleaded guilty to a federal charge of recklessly flying his aircraft. The man admitted he launched his DJI quadcopter to observe fire damage over the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, despite the FAA having restricted drone flying in the area, according to court records. The operator lost sight of the drone after it flew about 1.5 miles from where he had launched it. And that’s when it struck the “Super Scooper.” This rule applies directly to commercial and recreational drone operators who must apply to be able to fly drones out of sight. People who buy drones on their own and don’t get approval would still be prohibited from doing this. ___ Associated Press writers Dee-Ann Durbin, Rio Yamat and Didi Tang contributed to this report. ___ This story has been updated to correct Lisa Ellman’s first name.

Amazon Enters Correction Zone: Time to Panic or Be Brave?,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/amazon-enters-correction-zone-time-to-panic-or-be-brave/,"Tech giant Amazon.com Inc NASDAQ: AMZN delivered one of its better headline beats in last week’s earnings report, yet the stock has shed 10% in just two sessions. The swift drop follows a stunning 45% rally from April’s low, a run that left little room for anything short of perfection. With the broader market refusing to be dragged down by Amazon, a rare and notable divergence, those of us on the sidelines need to ask ourselves some important questions. For example, is this simply a much-needed bout of profit-taking, or could it be the start of a much deeper shake-out? And depending on how you feel about it, is now the time to panic or the time to be brave? Let’s start with the fundamentals. There’s no escaping from the fact that Amazon’s headline results last week hardly read like a company in trouble. Revenue rose double-digits year-over-year and topped Wall Street’s forecast by a comfortable margin, while earnings per share were 25% higher than expected. There were also plenty of other bright spots under the hood, such as its much-watched AWS business, which showed encouraging signs of cloud demand continuing to grow. However, management’s cautious guidance for operating income seems to have spooked investors. The midpoint fell a shade below consensus, and after a nearly vertical four-month ascent, many of Amazon’s bulls seem to have seized the excuse to lock in some of their gains. This is even though almost all analysts covering Amazon have reiterated bullish outlooks in the aftermath of Thursday’s report. The teams over at Goldman Sachs and Cowen did just that, for example, on Friday, as did BMO Capital Markets, the latter even boosting their price target up to $280. From the $212 level, Amazon closed just below on Monday, which points to a targeted upside of some 30%; not bad for a $2.2 trillion company. The analysts are mostly united in their praise for Amazon’s steady retail profit growth, its shift toward higher-margin advertising revenue, and an increasing potential for AI-driven efficiencies. These positive factors are expected to persist for some time, and investors should capitalize on them. Technically, the stock has already met the textbook definition of a correction, sliding 10% from its recent high. The relative strength index now hovers in the mid-30s, just above the extremely oversold threshold, a territory it has not visited since early spring. Simultaneously, it’s also now trading at a decent support level around the $210 mark, an area where dip-buyers stepped in during June, adding to the sense that this could be a prime entry point. If this level were to hold through this week, we could look at a clean signal that the worst of the shake-out is done. Yet it has to be said that Amazon’s post-earnings sell-off continued yesterday even as the S&P 500 logged one of its better days in weeks, a rare divergence that hints at real money leaving the table. That absence of dip-buyers could well mean institutions want to see some consolidation before redeploying capital, and indeed, it’s hard to argue that a cooling-off period isn’t needed, even if it feels painful. The bears will also point to management’s heavier spending plans on artificial intelligence and infrastructure and ongoing concerns about Amazon’s broader vulnerability. If the macro backdrop wobbles, for example, or we see increased tariff uncertainty or a consumer soft patch, this profit-taking could quickly become more structural. However, keep in mind that Amazon’s report showed some real revenue momentum for last quarter, their margins are in good shape, and their AWS franchise remains pretty dominant among its competitors. The market’s reaction looks more like a healthy reset than a full reversal, for now at least. Whether you’re stepping aside for a clearer technical signal or are starting to build a position now, the real question is whether Amazon’s long-term growth machine has changed—for most analysts and many seasoned investors, the answer is a confident no.

Why Citigroup Analysts See Double-Digit Upside in Coinbase Stock,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/why-citigroup-analysts-see-double-digit-upside-in-coinbase-stock/,"Most investors would agree that today’s stock market is dominated by risk-on sentiment, with the S&P 500 reaching new all-time highs largely due to the strong performance of a few leading technology stocks. There is nothing wrong with this situation, but it does raise a few flags for active investors moving forward, flags that represent additional profit potential. Since this risk-on outlook mainly reflects the collective mindset rather than a specific quantitative measure, investors anticipate a spill-over effect from stocks to other speculative sectors. That's where Bitcoin's role becomes important as the top speculative asset in cryptocurrency, frequently hitting and maintaining near new all-time highs. However, Bitcoin's upward trend has not been without a few bumps of volatility, which is why investors might expect better financial performance from companies involved with Bitcoin as trading and transaction fees are likely to increase. For this reason, investors can make sense of a renewed upside potential in shares of Coinbase Global Inc. NASDAQ: COIN. Shares of Coinbase took a 15% dip during the week the company’s quarterly earnings were reported, and that’s a reaction not many had been expecting, considering the high price of Bitcoin right now and its popularity within the trading platform. However, cooler heads prevailed after the dip had settled, as some in the market realized that not even at its 52-week high did the Coinbase stock price reach its full earnings growth potential. Now that it has fallen to only 71% of its 52-week high, Coinbase could become a major dip-buying opportunity. Understanding Wall Street's perspective on companies is crucial because there is a very specific and important relationship between valuation multiples and earnings growth. This key ratio is called the price-to-earnings growth ratio (PEG), and it measures whether future earnings growth is already factored into the price. Seeing that Coinbase could deliver $2.02 in earnings per share (EPS) for the second quarter of 2026, a massive jump compared to today’s reported $0.12 in EPS, this much earnings growth is going to take an equally high valuation multiple to be considered priced in. That doesn’t seem to be the case today for Coinbase, as its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 50.6x (while still high) does not at all reflect this much EPS growth for the future, which is why investors will see a PEG ratio of only 0.5x today. Any measure below 1.0x for a PEG directly suggests that growth is not priced into the stock’s valuation. Living and breathing these sorts of indicators and language, Wall Street analysts had no choice but to step in and give the broader market a more useful point of view for Coinbase stock outside of its recently bearish price action, and that is one solid piece of data that investors can take home as well. Wall Street analysts will not often boost a stock’s rating or valuation targets during such a bearish price action as seen in Coinbase stock, so any positive reinforcement means a lot more during these times. When it comes to Coinbase, here is where analysts see the stock reaching up to: Coinbase still has a Hold consensus rating, but a bullish call from Citigroup analyst Peter Christiansen has drawn attention. He upgraded the stock to Buy and raised his price target from $270 to $505—a significant shift. With shares trading near recent lows, the new target suggests meaningful upside for investors. In fact, this opinion implies that Coinbase stock should rally by roughly 60% from where it has fallen to today, giving investors a reason to look deeper into it. Of course, this future EPS growth is at the helm of delivering on this promise, but now investors need to go back full circle. Coinbase’s earnings are likely to grow as long as the market stays in risk-on mode, keeping interest in Bitcoin high. That would support trading volumes and transaction fees, helping justify Wall Street’s current forecasts for EPS and valuation. Before you consider Coinbase Global, you'll want to hear this.
