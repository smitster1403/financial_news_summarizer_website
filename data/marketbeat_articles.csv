Trump administration imposes limits on Mexican flights and threatens Delta alliance in trade dispute,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-administration-imposes-limits-on-mexican-flights-and-threatens-delta-alliance-in-trade-dispute-2025-07-19/,"The Trump administration imposed new restrictions Saturday on flights from Mexico and threatened to end a longstanding partnership between Delta Air Lines and Aeromexico in response to limits the Mexican government placed on passenger and cargo flights into Mexico City several years ago. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Mexico's actions to force airlines to move out of the main Benito Juarez International Airport to the newer Felipe Angeles International Airport more than 30 miles (48.28 kilometers) away violated a trade agreement between the two countries and gave domestic airlines an unfair advantage. Mexico is the top foreign destination for Americans with more than 40 million passengers flying there last year. ""Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg deliberately allowed Mexico to break our bilateral aviation agreement,” Duffy said, referring to the previous president and his transportation secretary. “That ends today. Let these actions serve as a warning to any country who thinks it can take advantage of the U.S., our carriers, and our market. America First means fighting for the fundamental principle of fairness.” All Mexican passenger, cargo and charter airlines will now be required to submit their schedules to the Transportation Department and seek government approval of their flights until Duffy is satisfied with the way Mexico is treating U.S. airlines. It's not immediately clear how Duffy's actions might affect the broader trade war with Mexico and negotiations over tariffs. A spokesperson for Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum didn’t reply immediately to a request for comment. Sheinbaum didn’t mention the new restrictions during either of her two speaking events on Saturday. Delta and Aeromexico have been fighting the Transportation Department's efforts to end their partnership that began in 2016 since early last year. The airlines have argued that it's not fair to punish them for the Mexican government's actions, and they said ending their agreement would jeopardize nearly two dozen routes and $800 million in benefits to both countries' economies that come from tourism spending and jobs. “The U.S. Department of Transportation’s tentative proposal to terminate its approval of the strategic and pro-competitive partnership between Delta and Aeromexico would cause significant harm to consumers traveling between the U.S. and Mexico, as well as U.S. jobs, communities, and transborder competition,"" Delta said in a statement. Aeromexico’s press office said it was reviewing the order and intended to present a joint response with Delta in the coming days. But the order terminating approval of the agreement between the airlines wouldn't take effect until October, and the airlines are likely to continue fighting that decision. The airlines said in a previous filing fighting the order that it believes the loss of direct flights would prompt over 140,000 American tourists and nearly 90,000 Mexican tourists not to visit the other country and hurt the economies of both countries with the loss of their spending. ___ Associated Press writer Amaranta Marentes in Mexico City contributed to this report.

Tech company CEO resigns after controversy over video captured at Coldplay concert,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/tech-company-ceo-resigns-after-controversy-over-video-captured-at-coldplay-concert-2025-07-19/,"The IT company CEO captured in a widely circulated video showing him embracing an employee at a Coldplay concert has resigned. Andy Byron resigned from his job as CEO of Cincinnati-based Astronomer Inc., according to a statement posted on LinkedIn by the company Saturday. “Astronomer is committed to the values and culture that have guided us since our founding. Our leaders are expected to set the standard in both conduct and accountability, and recently, that standard was not met,” the company said in its post on LinkedIn. The move comes a day after the company said that Byron had been placed on leave and the board of directors had launched a formal investigation into the jumbotron incident, which went viral. A company spokesman later confirmed in a statement to AP that it was Byron and Astronomer chief people officer Kristin Cabot in the video. The short video clip shows Byron and Cabot as captured on the jumbotron at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, during a Coldplay concert on Wednesday. Lead singer Chris Martin asked the cameras to scan the crowd for his “Jumbotron Song,” when he sings a few lines about the people the camera lands on. “Either they’re having an affair or they’re just very shy,” he joked. Internet sleuths identified the man as the chief executive officer of a U.S.-based company and the woman as its chief people officer. Pete DeJoy, Astronomer’s cofounder and chief product officer, has been tapped as interim CEO while the company conducts a search for Byron’s successor. It’s easy to miss, but most concert venues have signs informing the audience that they could be filmed during the event. Look for them on the walls when you arrive and around the bar areas or toilets. It’s common practice especially when bands like to use performances for music videos or concert films. The venue in this case, Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, also has a privacy policy online which states: “When you visit our location or attend or participate in an event at our location, we may capture your image, voice and/or likeness, including through the use of CCTV cameras and/or when we film or photograph you in a public location.” “They probably would have got away with it if they hadn’t reacted,” said Alison Taylor, a clinical associate professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business. And by the time the alleged identities emerged on social media, it hit a classic nerve around “leaders acting like the rules don’t apply to them,” she added. Still, Taylor and others stress how quickly such a video lead to an internet search to find the people involved — and note that it’s important to remember that such “doxing” isn’t just reserved for famous people. Beyond someone simply spotting a familiar face and spreading the word, technological advances, such as the rising adoption of artificial intelligence, has made it easier and faster overall to find just about anyone in a viral video today. “It’s a little bit unsettling how easily we can be identified with biometrics, how our faces are online, how social media can track us — and how the internet has gone from being a place of interaction, to a gigantic surveillance system,” said Mary Angela Bock, an associate professor in the University of Texas at Austin’s School of Journalism and Media. “When you think about it, we are being surveilled by our social media. They’re tracking us in exchange for entertaining us.” _____ AP Business Writer Wyatte Grantham-Philips contributed to this report from New York.

PepsiCo Bottomed Out—Time to Chugalug This Blue-Chip Buy?,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/pepsico-bottomed-outtime-to-chugalug-this-blue-chip-buy/,"PepsiCo’s NASDAQ: PEP stock price sold off for a reason, but the sell-off overextended, and a buying opportunity is at hand. Already struggling with sluggish growth, recall-related issues, and macroeconomic concerns, tariffs and consumer headwinds further pushed the stock price to historical lows. PepsiCo's value is at the extreme low end of the range, and the yield is at the high end, offering a generational buying opportunity. Yielding well over 4% in mid-July, PepsiCo stock is as attractive as it has ever been and has a substantial upside for investors willing to load up and ride the rebound. In the long term, PepsiCo's fundamentals suggest that this stock could rise by 40% to retest the high end of its trading range without considering the addition of growth. Adding revenue and earnings growth into the equation, PepsiCo stock will likely reach new all-time highs; the only question is when. That is the rub for traders; this is a buy-and-hold income stock play with a two- to five-year time horizon. Investors with the patience to hold this consumer staples winner for longer will reap even greater rewards.  PepsiCo’s two-year stock price drop was like watching a train wreck slowly unfold. However, as the stock price declined, the volume rose, indicating that only a small portion of the market was selling, while the rest was buying as the share prices fell. The obvious buyers are institutions, and the data tracked by MarketBeat supports this idea. Institutions bought PepsiCo stock on balance in Q1 and Q2 of 2025, ramping their activity toward the quarter's end and carrying over strongly into the first two weeks of Q3. Assuming they remain bullish in Q3, which they likely will due to the valuation/dividend proposition and Q2 results, PepsiCo’s stock price will have a strong institutional tailwind in H2 2025. Likewise, the analysts' sentiment trends align with the price correction and a robust outlook for a rebound. They include a softening of sentiment from Moderate Buy to Hold and a reduction in the consensus price target; however, the price correction is rebounding from the low-end target, and the consensus forecasts a 17% price increase by the year’s end. A move to $158 would align the market with a critical resistance target and potential pivot point, and it would only need a catalyst to drive it to new highs. PepsiCo’s Q2 earnings results serve as a catalyst for the market, with revenue growing 1% to $22.73 billion and outperforming the consensus estimate by 190 basis points. North American Foods and APAC were the only areas of weakness, contracting by 2% and remaining flat, respectively. Meanwhile, organically, PepsiCo Beverage grew by 1%, International Beverage by 5%, Europe, Middle East, and Africa by 7%, and Latin America by 6%. Margin is another area of strength. The company continues to experience margin pressures but is navigating the environment well, producing $2.12 in adjusted earnings, approximately 400 basis points above the consensus figure. The critical details are that full-year guidance for revenue, earnings, and capital was reaffirmed, with first-half momentum expected to lead to second-half strength. Within those details is a forecast for increased capital returns, representing a 5% increase to the dividend and steady buybacks. Buybacks are forecasted to reach $1 billion by year’s end and reduce the share count incrementally. The initial market response to PepsiCo’s Q2 release is bullish. The market rose by over 3% in premarket trading to confirm support at the 30-day exponential moving average (EMA). Support at the 30-day EMA is critical, as it represents short-term traders, value hunters, and buy-and-hold income investors, with potential for further gains. The indicators, including MACD and stochastic, are bullish and poised to send a strong signal at the open. Assuming the market follows through on this, PEP stock should continue the reversal process and begin trending higher before the start of Q4. Before you consider PepsiCo, you'll want to hear this.

Is J.B. Hunt Stock a Sleeping Giant Heading Into 2026?,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/is-jb-hunt-stock-a-sleeping-giant-heading-into-2026/,"J.B. Hunt Transport Services' NASDAQ: JBHT stock price hit bottom earlier this year, setting it up for a significant reversal and potential gains over the next three to five years. The caveat is that it will take time for this shipping giant to regain traction and shift into a more bullish gear. The FQ2 2025 earnings were better than expected, and guidance was optimistic; however, risks remain, including those to capital return. The takeaway for investors is that this transportation stock has set its bottom and is unlikely to reach new lows; however, it will likely remain range-bound in 2025, potentially retesting support at lower levels than where it trades in mid-July, creating a more attractive entry point.  The risk to the capital return is significant. While the dividend is safe, the buybacks are not. The company’s Q2 income and free cash flow were insufficient to cover the total CAPEX, dividend, and buybacks, resulting in increased debt compared to the prior year's quarter and year-end. With only $355 million left on the current authorization, the risk is that share repurchases could slow or cease within the next quarter or two, depriving the market of much-needed support until business picks back up. The dividend is reliably safe at less than 30% of the earnings outlook and is still expected to increase annually. The company may slow the pace of dividend distribution increase, but it is unlikely to give up its 20-year history of consecutive increases easily. J.B. Hunt’s Q2 was neither bad nor good, with revenue of $2.93 billion, remaining flat compared to the previous year. The result is driven by strengths in most segments, offset by weaknesses in the same. The strengths include a 6% increase in Intermodal loads and Integrated Capacity Solutions revenue per load, a 3% productivity improvement in the Dedicated Capacity Solutions segment, and a 13% increase in JBT loads. Weaknesses include a 10% decline in Final Mile Services, a 9% decrease in ICS volume, a 3% reduction in DCS trucks, and a decrease in revenue per load in the JBI and JBT segments. Margin is the worst of the news. The company’s focus on efficiency and cost reductions is helping, but it has not fully offset the impacts of inflation. Inflation mainly affects wages, compensation, and insurance costs, which have slightly reduced profit margins. The net result is $197.3 million in operating income, a 4% reduction, and plans to reduce costs by an additional $100 million annually. The company didn’t give specific guidance, but remains optimistic; the outlook for wage and insurance costs is for them to continue rising. J.B. Hunt’s share buybacks set a quarterly record in FQ2 2025, resulting in a 5% average quarterly reduction. The bad news is that buybacks are reflected in the balance sheet with liabilities rising and assets and equity falling. Equity fell by nearly 10% YTD in 2025 and will likely continue eroding until growth is reinvigorated, buybacks or not. The post-release price action isn’t encouraging. The market fell by 1% in pre-market action following losses in the prior session that confirmed resistance at a critical level. The analysts were optimistic ahead of the release, issuing several price target increases that led to a high-end range; however, they may not continue this trend now. A series of price target reductions would put a firm cap on this market, ensuring a move lower in the third quarter. Until then, JBHT is rated as a Moderate Buy with potential for roughly 8% upside.

These 3 Rare Earth Stocks Are Surging Alongside MP Materials,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/these-3-rare-earth-stocks-are-surging-alongside-mp-materials/,"July has proven to be a massive month for rare earth mineral stocks, with MP Materials NYSE: MP at the forefront. On July 10, MP shares surged by nearly 51% after the company announced a multi-billion-dollar commitment from the Department of Defense (DOD). Then, on July 15, MP Materials announced a $500 million partnership with Apple NASDAQ: AAPL. The company will supply 100% recycled rare earth magnets for Apple devices. Shares rose another 20% in response. However, several other rare earth stocks have also seen their shares surge as the industry is having a moment in the sun. Some are making huge moves of their own, while others are rising simply off the back of MP Materials' recent successes. Let’s dive into three of these names below. First up is Critical Metals NASDAQ: CRML, a mining exploration and development company focused on lithium and other rare earth metals. The stock rose 7% after MP announced its DOD deal. However, shares really took off on July 15, as the company made a big announcement on the same day MP revealed the Apple partnership. The company announced it has begun drilling at its Tanbreez Rare Earth Project in Greenland. Particularly important is the fact that the company expects its newly installed drilling rig to significantly increase the size of its Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE). The MRE defines how much rare earth metal geologists believe is in a particular area and provides information on the certainty of these estimates. If Critical Materials increases the MRE estimate and gains a higher level of certainty around it, the value of the project increases. The company has almost no revenue and hopes to change this by getting production at the Tanbreez mine underway in 2026. Shares rose nearly 34% as a result of the announcement. The company also owns the rights to the Wolfsberg Lithium Project. The project is the first fully licensed hard-rock lithium mine in Europe, and the company hopes to begin production in 2026 or 2027. Next up is Ramaco Resources NASDAQ: METC. Since the announcement of MP’s DOD deal, Ramaco shares have been up nearly 73% as of the close of July 15. Shares rose 30% on July 10, as well as 15% on both July 14 and July 15. Ramaco has traditionally been a coal mining company. The company’s latest project is the Brook Mine in Sheridan, Wyoming. There, it plans to extract coal but also wants rare earth minerals. On July 10, the company released an independent preliminary economic assessment (PEA) of the Brook Mine. The PEA found that the mine contains substantial quantities of rare earth elements and is both commercially and technologically feasible. If brought into production, the Brook Mine would be the only other operational rare earths mine in the U.S., besides MP’s Mountain Pass mine in California. It would also stand out from Mountain Pass in its ability to produce a large amount of more valuable heavy rare earth elements. Ramaco believes the mine’s output could meet 30% of the United States defense industry's demand for rare earth magnets. Last up is USA Rare Earth NASDAQ: USAR. Since July 10, shares are up approximately 59% as of the July 15 close. Unlike the other two firms on this list, USA Rare Earth didn’t release any new information that would have caused the rise in shares. Instead, the stock seems to simply be riding the coattails of MP Materials and other rare-earth names. The company has no revenue and is working to develop a vertically integrated rare-earth supply chain in the United States. It is building a magnet production facility in Oklahoma and hopes to open a rare earth mine in Texas in several years. The company hopes to attract federal government funding for its projects, which may now be more likely given the DOD investment in MP. Ultimately, rare earths have clearly become a strategic priority for the U.S. government and huge companies like Apple. This creates a significant opportunity for the names above. However, it is important to understand that small mining stocks are notoriously risky. Projects are capitally intensive and often face long lead times and regulatory hurdles. This can lead mining companies to invest years and millions of dollars with little to show for it if things don’t go according to plan. Before you consider Critical Metals, you'll want to hear this.

Gene therapy maker Sarepta tells FDA it won't halt shipments despite patient deaths,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/gene-therapy-maker-sarepta-tells-fda-it-wont-halt-shipments-despite-patient-deaths-2025-07-19/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Drugmaker Sarepta Therapeutics said late Friday it won't comply with a request from the Food and Drug Administration to halt all shipments of its gene therapy following the death of a third patient receiving one of its treatments for muscular dystrophy. The highly unusual move is a latest in a string of events that have hammered the company's stock for weeks and recently forced it to lay off 500 employees. The company's decision not to comply with the FDA also places future availability of its leading therapy, called Elevidys, in doubt. The FDA said in a statement Friday night that officials met with Sarepta and requested it suspend all sales but “the company refused to do so.” The agency has the authority to pull drugs from the market, but the cumbersome regulatory process can take months or even years. Instead, the agency usually makes an informal request and companies almost always comply. “We believe in access to drugs for unmet medical needs but are not afraid to take immediate action when a serious safety signal emerges,” FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said in a statement. Elevidys is the first gene therapy approved in the U.S. for Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, the fatal muscle-wasting disease that affects males, though it has faced scrutiny since its clearance in 2023. The one-time treatment received accelerated approval against the recommendations of some FDA scientists who doubted its effectiveness. The FDA granted full approval last year and expanded the therapy’s use to patients 4 years and older, including those who can no longer walk. Previously, it was only available for younger patients who were still walking. Sarepta said Friday that its scientific review showed “no new or changed safety signals” for younger patients with Duchenne’s who have earlier stages of the disease. The company said it plans to keep the drug available for those patients. “We look forward to continued discussions and sharing of information with FDA,” the company said in a statement. Sarepta halted shipments last month of the therapy for older boys with Duchenne’s, which gradually destroys muscle and skeletal strength, resulting in early death. The move followed the deaths of two teenage boys taking the therapy. The company also confirmed a third death Friday: a 51-year-old patient who was taking an experimental gene therapy in a trial for a different form of muscular dystrophy. Sarepta said it reported the death to the FDA on June 20. The FDA said Friday it placed that trial on hold. Sarepta noted that the gene therapy involved in the incident uses “a different dose and is manufactured using a different process,” than Elevidys. All three patient deaths were linked to liver injury, a side effect noted in Sarepta's prescribing information. Earlier this week Sarepta announced it would add a bold warning to drug and lay off a third of its employees. The company did not mention the third patient death in its news release or conference call announcing those changes, sparking pointed criticism from Wall Street analysts. Company shares fell more than 35% Friday to close at $14.07. Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Sarepta has received FDA approval for three other Duchenne’s drugs since 2016, none of which have been confirmed to work. The company has long been criticized for failing to complete several studies needed to secure full FDA approval of its drugs. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

"New airport scanners are better at spotting liquid explosives, but many airports lack them",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/new-airport-scanners-are-better-at-spotting-liquid-explosives-but-many-airports-lack-them-2025-07-19/,"Travelers celebrated the suggestion that American airports might soon ease restrictions on liquids in carry-on bags that create endless hassles at security checkpoints, but more than a third of all airports around the country still haven't upgraded their screening systems to reliably detect liquid explosives that could bring down a plane. It may be annoying to have to dump water and other drinks before going through security, but the challenge is to detect the difference between things like harmless hair gel and more sinister substances. The threat nearly materialized in an attack in 2006, when authorities in the United Kingdom arrested a group that was plotting to blow holes in airliners with a homemade mixture of chemicals in sports drink bottles. Security experts remain concerned about the vulnerabilities that were exposed by that plot. Comments this week by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem got travelers excited about the prospect of one day being able to fly with more than 3 ounces of their shampoos and gels and not having to throw out the beverage they just bought. “The liquids, I’m questioning. So that may be the next big announcement, is what size your liquids need to be,” Noem said. “We have put in place in TSA a multilayered screening process that allows us to change some of how we do security and screening so it’s still as safe.” A Transportation Security Administration spokesperson said Noem and the agency “are constantly looking for ways to enhance security, and improve the travel experience for the public.” Any changes will come through the same official channels that TSA used to announce this month that travelers can keep their shoes on at checkpoints. That change offers relief from a rule adopted after “shoe bomber” Richard Reid’s failed attempt to take down a flight from Paris to Miami in late 2001 with a small explosive device hidden in his footwear. The limits on liquids were triggered by the 2006 U.K. arrests. Three ringleaders were eventually convicted. Prosecutors told the jury in that case that authorities uncovered the plot after secretly searching the luggage of a man who was on their radar for security concerns after he returned from Pakistan and found the unusual combination of the Tang powdered soft drink and a large number of batteries, according to the BBC. That triggered the surveillance operation that eventually grew to include more than 200 officers. Agents discovered what appeared to be a bomb factory in a London apartment where odd devices were being constructed out of drink bottles. The plot didn't make sense until authorities discovered that the men were researching flight timetables and realized they were only trying to make an explosive big enough to rip a hole in a plane. The meaning of coded emails to contacts in Pakistan only became clear after the arrests, when authorities realized that the quantities of Calvin Klein aftershave being discussed in messages matched the amount of hydrogen peroxide the conspirators had purchased. Ever since then, the TSA and authorities in other countries have limited carry-on liquids and gels to 3.4 ounces (100 milliliters) because officials believe that amount is too small to create an explosion capable of taking down a plane. The restriction covered all types of liquids, because X-ray machines at checkpoints couldn't differentiate between explosive and harmless ones. The United Kingdom was planning to ease its restrictions last year to allow people to carry up to 2 liters (about half a gallon) of liquid, but that was delayed because several major airports still didn't have the new scanners that use computed tomography, commonly known as a CT scan, to produce clearer images. The new machines allow screeners to switch between two-dimensional and three-dimensional images and turn them to see what may be lurking, said Johnny Jones, secretary treasurer of the chapter of the American Federation of Government Employees that represents TSA workers. “It’s just a totally life-changing situation,” said Jones, who has worked as a screener since the agency was created. “It’s a difference of being able to see something that would have been hidden by something that you can now see clear as day with the new technology. It eliminates the guesswork.” The problem is that only 255 of the 432 airports across the United States have new CT scanners installed, the interim head of the TSA told Congress this spring. The biggest airports got them first, but they are not expected to be everywhere until 2043. It's possible that a change in carry-on liquid policy could be implemented just at the biggest airports, but that could lead to confusion if travelers, are, say, allowed to bring full bottles on departure only to have them confiscated when they return. The scanners cost more than $2 million apiece, and they are so much bigger than the old X-ray machines that sometimes floors must be reinforced and checkpoints have to be redesigned. “I think you need to hold off till we get more systems deployed. I think this one’s a little too early,” said Jeff Price, who teaches aviation security at Metropolitan State University of Denver and has co-authored books on the subject. “The keep your shoes on — I can get on board with that provided we continue to do random screenings. But the liquids, I think we’re too early on that. There’s other layers of security. Yeah, I know that. But not too many of them that prevent this type of attack.” In the past the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security has highlighted vulnerabilities in TSA screening that can allow things to slip through undetected. A 2015 report found that TSA officers failed 95% of the time to detect weapons or explosive material carried by undercover inspectors. But Jones defended the work of the screeners he represents, noting that since the agency's creation, no plane has failed to reach its destination because of something that was missed. “Nothing large has been able to make it through our system since we’ve taken over screening. We've protected the skies for 22 years,” Jones said. “Even if you have a slight miss, it doesn’t necessarily mean anything is going to happen on the plane.” Before you consider Travelers Companies, you'll want to hear this.

Gunmen kill 2 Indians and abduct a third in Niger,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/gunmen-kill-2-indians-and-abduct-a-third-in-niger-2025-07-19/,"NIAMEY, Niger (AP) — Gunmen killed at least two Indians and abducted a third during an attack in Niger’s southwest Dosso region, according to Indian authorities, the latest such violence targeting foreigners in Niger’s conflict-battered territories. The Indian Embassy in Niger said in a statement on X on Friday that the attack occurred on Tuesday, and that it was in touch with local authorities to repatriate the bodies of the victims and ensure the safe release of the kidnapped individual. Local media in Niger identified the victims as workers at a construction site in Dosso, located 140 kilometers (87 miles) from the country’s capital of Niamey. Foreigners are increasingly becoming targets of armed groups in Niger. Several of them have been kidnapped this year, including an Austrian woman who has lived in Niger as an aid worker for more than 20 years, a Swiss woman seized from her home in April and five Indian workers, also in April. Niger has for many years battled a jihadi insurgency linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group, a security crisis that analysts say has worsened since the military toppled the country’s government in July 2023, and has since struggled to restore peace in hot spots. According to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, June was one of the country’s deadliest months on record as IS-backed fighters launched a major offensive across the Tillaberi and Dosso regions, killing more than 100 civilians in what marked a return to mass atrocities in rural areas.

MarketBeat Week in Review – 07/14 - 07/18,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/marketbeat-week-in-review-07-14-07-18/,"Better-than-expected news drove the market higher this week. Inflation readings, retail sales data, unemployment claims, and consumer confidence all showed an economy that continues to outperform expectations. Investors took it from there, pushing the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ to record highs. The overall sentiment is that the economy will continue to strengthen in the year's second half. That optimism is getting support from the kickoff to earnings season. The big banks had solid reports, and names like PepsiCo Inc. NASDAQ: PEP and Netflix Inc. NASDAQ: NFLX have also set the stage for a broader rally. Next week will be light on economic data, but investors will still get the latest data on new home sales and durable goods orders. Earnings season begins to ramp up with Alphabet Inc. NASDAQ: GOOGL being one of the first big tech stocks to report. The MarketBeat analysts will be on top of the stocks and stories moving the market. Here are some of our most popular articles from this week. Articles by Thomas Hughes The artificial intelligence (AI) economy is rolling along, meaning the runway for chip stocks will be measured in years. This week, Thomas Hughes focused on two of the biggest names in this space that were making big news. Perhaps the most significant story this week was that the U.S. government has assured NVIDIA Corp. NASDAQ: NVDA it will receive a license to sell its H20 chips to China. Hughes explained why NVDA stock may be on the way to gains of 30% to 60%. Hughes also wrote about news from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. NASDAQ: AMD that reminds investors that competition to NVIDIA is coming. Hughes pointed out a technical indicator that suggests AMD stock is ready for a breakout. The bull case could be confirmed when the company reports earnings in early August. Cybersecurity is another red-hot sector for investors. This week, Hughes highlighted data from Wedbush about how AI will drive the industry's growth, as well as three cybersecurity stocks that the firm believes will lead the way. Articles by Sam Quirke Tesla Inc. NASDAQ: TSLA will report earnings next week, and Sam Quirke explained why, despite the stock’s 30% rally off its April lows, analysts remain divided. Quirke gave bulls and bears examples of how to play TSLA stock before next week’s report. Qualcomm Corp. NASDAQ: QCOM is another stock that’s made a significant move in the last quarter. However, unlike other chip stocks, Quirke pointed out that QCOM stock appears to be undervalued, which could be setting the stage for a breakout after its earnings report later this month. Sticking with the theme of stocks that are in rally mode, Quirke made a case for why Amazon.com Inc. NASDAQ: AMZN may be making a case as a forever stock. Heading into earnings, the stock is up about 30% in the last three months, and analysts believe the stock is ready to move higher. Articles by Chris Markoch Technology stocks continue to lead the market higher. That could be great news for Microsoft Corp. NASDAQ: MSFT shareholders. Chris Markoch wrote about the recent forecast from Dan Ives of Wedbush, which suggests MSFT stock could become a $600 stock in the next 12 months. Ives also continues to be bullish on Palantir Technologies Inc. NASDAQ: PLTR. The analyst raised his price target on PLTR stock to $160. Markoch explained why retail investors will continue to hold PLTR stock even if it has limited upside in the short term. Consumer staples stocks continue to underperform the market. But Markoch reminded investors there are still winners in every sector and gave them three defensive names to add this earnings season. Articles by Ryan Hasson Rocket Lab USA Inc. NASDAQ: RKLB continues to be one of the best-performing stocks of 2025. But this week, Ryan Hasson explained why recent analyst commentary suggests the stock may still offer more upside, and why the chart shows that investors looking for a better entry point should set their price targets now. Investors are looking at robotics stocks as an AI-adjacent sector that will define the future of automation. This week, Hasson highlighted five robotics stocks that combine innovation, market leadership, and long-term growth potential. Articles by Gabriel Osorio-Mazilli Investors have been piling back into technology stocks. However, Gabriel Osorio-Mazilli reminded investors that a rally could be coming in value stocks. Osorio-Mazilli highlighted three undervalued stocks that are drawing high institutional interest. Broadcom Inc. NASDAQ: AVGO may not be undervalued, but at least one investor is betting Broadcom has more room to run. Osorio-Mazilli explained why Nancy Pelosi exercising her call options on AVGO stock is a significant bet that the company's made-in-America footprint makes it a strong choice among AI stocks. Copper made news this week as the latest focus of the Trump administration's tariff plans. Osorio-Mazilli explained why Super Micro Computer Inc. NASDAQ: SMCI looks like a buying opportunity. Its liquid cooling technology will increase data center efficiency to offset higher copper prices. Articles by Leo Miller Companies buy back their stock when they believe it's undervalued. This week, Leo Miller directed investors to two companies increasing their buyback activity even though their respective stocks have outperformed the broader market. Another way that companies express belief in their stocks is through insider buying. Investors can profit from taking positions in companies showing a heavy degree of insider buying. Miller highlighted three stocks that have shown heavy insider buying in the last 60 days. An emerging theme of this quarter’s earnings may be what investors should do when good enough just isn’t good enough. This week, Miller explained how that theme played out with GE Aerospace NYSE: GE. The company had a strong earnings report, but the strong run-up in the stock prior to earnings is now creating resistance. Articles by Nathan Reiff Investors can tell risk-on sentiment is back in the market when speculative stocks are catching a bid. This week, Nathan Reiff pointed investors to three high-risk stocks that analysts believe may be setting up for explosive returns. Sticking with speculative stocks, Reiff wrote about the recent rally in Tilray Brands Inc. NASDAQ: TLRY. Investors are responding to the company’s positive cash flow, but Reiff pointed out that the cannabis sector still faces significant risks that may continue to weigh on TLRY stock. Articles by Jeffrey Neal Johnson Flying taxis or eVTOLs are becoming a reality. That means it’s time for speculative investors to decide how to invest in this sector. Jeffrey Neal Johnson pointed investors to Joby Aviation Inc. NYSE: JOBY and Archer Aviation Inc. NYSE: ACHR. These are the undisputed leaders in this emerging sector. However, the companies take two different approaches that make them very different investment opportunities. Intel Corp. NASDAQ: INTC has been a bullish but volatile stock ahead of its July 24 earnings report. Johnson explained the bullish news that triggered the rally and what investors may need to hear to send the stock higher. Renewable energy stocks have been one of the worst-performing stocks in 2025. However, Johnson explained why a loan guarantee from the U.S. Department of Energy raises the bull case for Plug Power Inc. NASDAQ: PLUG. Articles by Jordan Chussler Fund investors are frequently unaware of the risk of investing in “safe” weighted index funds. That’s why Jordan Chussler highlighted the Invesco S&P 500 Low Volatility ETF NYSEARCA: SPLV. The fund tracks the 100 lowest-volatility stocks in the S&P 500, making it a solid choice for investors looking for defensive stocks to manage market uncertainty. Articles by Brian O’Connell In the next two weeks, investors will hear from several of the Magnificent Seven stocks. However, Brian O’Connell explained why one fund manager believes investors should be selling two Mag 7 stocks and buying two other technology names. O’Connell also wrote about three restaurant stocks that are bucking the weakness in the fast food sector. Each of these stocks has at least one catalyst that analysts believe will help them overcome the headwinds in the sector.

The Chicago Sky are trying to protect their players on social media. Here's what that means,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/the-chicago-sky-are-trying-to-protect-their-players-on-social-media-heres-what-that-means-2025-07-19/,"INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Chicago Sky co-owner Nadia Rawlinson knew security concerns were serious. The Sky have physical security nearly 24 hours a day — around hotels, outside gyms, by buses and planes — but one of the final frontiers of player safety was the internet. Earlier this month, the Sky teamed up with Moonshot to protect their players from threats and hate on social media, the first relationship of its kind in the WNBA. “People think as athletes, we should take what comes our way,” Sky guard Ariel Atkins said. “We are human and some comments that people make are inhumane. It’s phenomenal of our organization to take care of us.” Moonshot’s technology was created for use in counterterrorism; it's used by the U.S. government. “It’s a great thing to implement right now,” said Sky All-Star Angel Reese, who has one of the most popular social media platforms among WNBA players. “It’s really important to be able to have that (protection), especially as a woman."" Moonshot monitors more than 25 social media and internet platforms, including those on which players do not have personal accounts. The technology shrinks the millions of posts it looks at every day into thousands of posts that contain direct threats to the athletes. From there, Moonshot’s team of human threat assessors, from clinical psychologists to social workers, takes over. They look through the flagged posts and report them, if necessary — whether that’s to the social media platforms themselves for removal or, in more serious and imminent cases, directly to law enforcement. They target actionable threats to the athletes, like the release of their personal information or possible stalkers. It’s that human involvement that Moonshot co-founder and CEO Vidhya Ramalingam said is necessary to its success. “This is not a problem that can just be solved by technology alone,” she said. “It’s fundamentally a human problem, and this is a human partnership.” Rawlinson, who said her own experiences as a woman of color have informed her understanding of the issue, knew it was something she wanted to focus on. “With the rise in women’s sports, the rise in attention, the greater fandom, the greater investment, all of it is historic,” Rawlinson said. “But there’s a dark side to that. At some point, you just want to play the game, so the goal is to remove some of the noise that happens off the court.” After reading about Moonshot in a tech publication a few weeks ago, Rawlinson reached out to Ramalingam about a partnership. It was a quick connection. “It was really clear there was a values alignment,” Ramalingam said. “Some of that stems from some of our shared experiences as women of color in spaces where so often our voices are underrepresented, and the desire to actually do something about it and not just sit there. “For far too long, I saw women like me, people of color, be overrepresented as targets and underrepresented in the solution,” she said. ___ This story has been corrected to show that the name of the company the Chicago Sky have partnered with is Moonshot, not Moonshot Technologies. ___ AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

"As the going gets tough in South Sudan, some artisans offer cheap footwear made from rubber tires",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/as-the-going-gets-tough-in-south-sudan-some-artisans-offer-cheap-footwear-made-from-rubber-tires-2025-07-18/,"WAU, South Sudan (AP) — From Rwanda to Kenya, fashioning footwear from discarded tires has long been a mark of local ingenuity. In South Sudan, however, the creative work of such artisans is now fueled by an economic crisis that has left the government on the verge of bankruptcy and many people struggling to put food on the table. As South Sudan’s oil revenues have dwindled, the government for months has been unable to pay civil servants on time. The cash crisis affects everyone from soldiers to teachers, underscoring the range of economic hardship across the country, and many are looking for ways to keep going. Some want cheap shoes, finding them not in supermarkets but in open markets where flip-flops and sandals are fashioned from worn-out tires usually thrown away as rubbish. In Wau, some 650 kilometers (400 miles) from the South Sudanese capital of Juba, shoemaker Emmanuel Achuil works under the shade of a tarpaulin in the town's bustling main market. His hands blackened from grappling with rubber, Achuil uses a blade to carve pieces from discarded tires. Colorful straps are scattered around him like pieces of a puzzle. Achuil, who makes five to 10 pairs a week, told the AP that in recent months he’s seen a rise in demand that he and others say is directly related to the rising cost of living here. They say footwear made from scraps of rubber has found a firm place in local markets, confirmed in the ubiquitous displays of such shoes even in open markets in Juba. Two years ago, Achuil was getting five to seven customers a month. Now he expects up to 20 of them, he said. Achuil’s shoes can fetch up to 15,000 South Sudanese pounds a pair, or roughly $4, depending on size and quality of finishing. In addition to their affordability, the rough-hewn pairs are praised for their durability. “Even when things get bad — no food, no jobs — this work doesn’t fail me,” Achuil said. “People always need shoes, especially cheap ones.” Akol Majok Ring, a cattle-keeper from the state of Warrap, said he discovered these sandals in March and immediately bought a pair for himself because “they are good for cattle grazing.” “When you’re moving with the cattle all day, these sandals are perfect,"" he said. “They’re durable and well-suited for the job.” The South Sudanese pound has been under pressure since 2023, losing much of its value against the dollar as oil exports are sporadically disrupted by civil war in neighboring Sudan. The economy has been in decline for five consecutive years, hampered by violence stemming mostly from the political contest between President Salva Kiir and his deputy Riek Machar, who is currently under house arrest for alleged subversion. Hyperinflation and widespread food insecurity affect nearly 80% of South Sudan's 11 million people, the same number of people living below the poverty line, according to the World Bank. South Sudan depends on oil revenues to meet 90% of the government’s annual budget, but damage earlier this year to the oil pipeline through Sudan left South Sudanese authorities briefly unable to export any crude. The government announced earlier in June that exports were due to resume after repairs to the pipeline. Many government workers are effectively without pay, and unemployment is rampant even as the prices of basic goods skyrocket. Leather shoes in the shops can seem a luxury in these circumstances. “Tire soles last longer,” said Deng Akol Athuai, who has been buying from Achuil for years. “I buy one pair, and it lasts me a year or more. They’re strong, especially for walking on rough roads.” Gabriel Bataku, a 26-year-old who is unemployed in Wau, said of artisans that they “are solving real problems. They just need recognition and support.” Achuil has been making shoes since 1996. He is not formally trained. He got his skills as a grade schooler watching older men in their workshops as they went about their business. In those days discarded tires were much easier to find, scavenged from garages or sourced through people throwing them away. But now, he said, “more people are doing this work, so the competition for materials is high.” He lamented the lack of formal support, from the government and others, that has left artisans struggling to access the tools of their trade. He wants access to better equipment. Despite the difficulties, he dreams of opening a proper workshop where he would train others. He also hopes to be able to expand his business to other towns in South Sudan. “If I had better cutting tools, and a way to expand, I could train young people,” he said. “Many are idle here in Wau. This skill could help them survive.” ___ For more on Africa and development: https://apnews.com/hub/africa-pulse The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

"Did money or politics cause Colbert cancellation? Either way, the economics are tough for TV",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/did-money-or-politics-cause-colbert-cancellation-either-way-the-economics-are-tough-for-tv-2025-07-18/,"CBS says its decision to end Stephen Colbert’s late-night comedy show is financial, not political. Yet even with the ample skepticism about that explanation, there's no denying the economics were not working in Colbert's favor. The network’s bombshell announcement late Thursday that the “Late Show” will end next May takes away President Donald Trump’s most prominent TV critic and the most popular entertainment program in its genre. The television industry's declining economic health means similar hard calls are already being made with personalities and programming, with others to be faced in the future. For the late-night genre, there are unique factors to consider. As recently as 2018, broadcast networks took in an estimated $439 million in advertising revenue for its late-night programs, according to the advertising firm Guidelines. Last year, that number dwindled to $220 million. Late-night TV was a particular draw for young men, considered the hardest-to-get and most valuable demographic for advertisers. Increasingly, these viewers are turning to streaming services, either to watch something else entirely or catch highlights of the late-night shows, which are more difficult for the networks to monetize. More broadly, the much-predicted takeover of viewers by streaming services is coming to pass. The Nielsen company reported that during the last two months, for the first time ever, more people consumed programming on services like YouTube and Netflix than on ABC, CBS and NBC or any cable network. Networks and streamers spent roughly $70 billion on entertainment shows and $30 billion for sports rights last year, said Brian Wieser, CEO of Madison & Wall, an advertising consultant and data services firm. Live sports is the most dependable magnet for viewers and costs for its rights are expected to increase 8% a year over the next decade. With television viewership declining in general, it's clear where savings will have to come from. Wieser said he does not know whether Colbert's show is profitable or not for CBS and parent company Paramount Global, but he knows the direction in which it is headed. “The economics of television are weak,” he said. In a statement announcing the cancellation, George Cheeks, Paramount Global's president and chief executive officer, said that “This is purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night. It is not related in any way to the show’s performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.” Cheeks' problem is that not everyone believes him. Colbert is a relentless critic of Trump, and earlier this week pointedly criticized Paramount's decision to settle Trump's lawsuit against CBS over a “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris. He called Paramount's $16 million payment to Trump a “big fat bribe,” since the company is seeking the administration's approval of its merger with Skydance Media. On Friday, the Writers Guild of America called for an investigation by New York's attorney general into whether Colbert's cancellation is itself a bribe, “sacrificing free speech to curry favor with the Trump administration as the company looks for merger approval.” CBS' decision made this a pivotal week for the future of television and radio programming. Congress stripped federal funding for PBS and NPR, threatening the future of shows on those outlets. Journey Gunderson, executive director of the National Comedy Center, called the decision to end Colbert's show the end of an era. “Late-night television has historically been one of comedy's most audience-accessible platforms — a place where commentary meets community, night after night,” Gunderson said. “This isn't just the end of a show. It's the quiet removal of one of the few remaining platforms for daily comedic commentary. Trump, who has called in the past for CBS to terminate Colbert's contract, celebrated the show's upcoming demise. “I absolutely love that Colbert got fired,” the president wrote on Truth Social. “His talent was even less than his ratings.” Some experts questioned whether CBS could have explored other ways to save money on Colbert. NBC, for example, has cut costs by eliminating the band on Seth Meyers' late-night show and curtailing Jimmy Fallon's “Tonight” show to four nights a week. Could CBS have saved more money by cutting off the show immediately, instead of letting it run until next May, which sets up an awkward “lame duck” period? Then again, Colbert will keep working until his contract runs out; CBS would have had to keep paying him anyway. CBS recently cancelled the “After Midnight” show that ran after Colbert. But the network had signaled earlier this year that it was prepared to continue that show until host Taylor Tomlinson decided that she wanted to leave, noted Bill Carter, author of “The Late Shift.” “It is a very sad day for CBS that they are getting out of the late-night race,” Andy Cohen, host of Bravo's “Watch What Happens Live,"" told The Associated Press. “I mean, they are turning off the lights after the news.” Colbert, if he wanted to continue past next May, would likely be able to find a streaming service willing to pay him, Wieser said. But the future of late-night comedy on the entertainment networks is genuinely at risk. Trump, in fact, may outlast his fiercest comic critics. Jon Stewart, once a weeknight fixture, works one night a week at “The Daily Show” for Paramount's Comedy Central, a network that seldom produces much original programming any more. ABC's Jimmy Kimmel, who was chided on social media by Trump on Friday — “I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next” — has a contract that also runs out next year. Kimmel, 57, openly wondered in a Variety interview before signing his latest three-year contract extension how long he wanted to do it. He's hosted his show since 2003. “I have moments where I go, I cannot do this anymore,” Kimmel told Variety in 2022. “And I have moments where I go, what am I gonna do with my life if I'm not doing this anymore?' It's a very complicated thing ... I'm not going to do this forever.” Colbert, Kimmel and Stewart were all nominated for Emmy awards this week. ___ AP journalist Liam McEwan in Los Angeles contributed to this report.

"Lawyer argues Call of Duty maker can't be held responsible for actions of Uvalde, Texas, shooter",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/lawyer-argues-call-of-duty-maker-cant-be-held-responsible-for-actions-of-uvalde-texas-shooter-2025-07-18/,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — A lawyer for the maker of the video game Call of Duty argued Friday that a judge should dismiss a lawsuit brought by families of the victims of the Robb Elementary School attack in Uvalde, Texas, saying the contents of the war game are protected by the First Amendment. The families sued Call of Duty maker Activision and Meta Platforms, which owns Instagram, saying that the companies bear responsibility for promoting products used by the teen gunman. Three sets of parents who lost children in the shooting were in the audience at the Los Angeles hearing. Activision lawyer Bethany Kristovich told Superior Court Judge William Highberger that the “First Amendment bars their claims, period full stop.” “The issues of gun violence are incredibly difficult,” Kristovich said. “The evidence in this case is not.” She argued that the case has little chance of prevailing if it continues, because courts have repeatedly held that “creators of artistic works, whether they be books, music, movies, TV or video games, cannot be held legally liable for the acts of their audience.” The lawsuit, one of many involving Uvalde families, was filed last year on the second anniversary of one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history. The gunman killed 19 students and two teachers. Officers finally confronted and shot him after waiting more than an hour to enter the fourth-grade classroom. Kimberly Rubio, whose 10-year-old daughter Lexi was killed in the shooting, was among the parents who came from Texas to Southern California, where Activision is based, for the hearing. “We traveled all this way, so we need answers,” Rubio said outside the courthouse. ""It's our hope that the case will move forward so we can get those answers."" An attorney for the families argued during the hearing that Call of Duty exceeds its First Amendment protections by moving into marketing. “The basis of our complaint is not the existence of Call of Duty,"" Katie Mesner-Hage told the judge. ""It is using Call of Duty as a platform to market weapons to minors.” The plaintiffs' lawyers showed contracts and correspondence between executives at Activison and gunmakers whose products, they said, are clearly and exactly depicted in the game despite brand names not appearing. Mesner-Hage said the documents show that they actually prefer being unlabeled because “it helps shield them from the implication that they are marketing guns to minors,” while knowing that players will still identify and seek out the weapons. Kristovich said there is no evidence that the kind of product placement and marketing the plaintiffs are talking about happened in any of the editions of the game the shooter played. The families have also filed a lawsuit against Daniel Defense, which manufactured the AR-style rifle used in the May 24, 2022, shooting. Koskoff argued that a replica of the rifle clearly appears on a splash page for Call of Duty. Josh Koskoff, the families' Connecticut-based lead attorney, also represented families of nine Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims in a lawsuit against gunmaker Remington and got a $73 million lawsuit settlement. He invoked Sandy Hook several times in his arguments, saying the shooters there and in Uvalde shared the same gaming obsession. Koskoff said the Uvalde shooter experienced “the absorption and the loss of self in Call of Duty.” He said that immersion was so deep that the shooter searched online for how to obtain an armored suit that he didn't know only exists in the game. Koskoff played a clip from Call of Duty Modern Warfare, the game the shooter played, with a first-person shooter gunning down opponents. The shots echoed loudly in the courtroom, and several people in the audience slowly shook their heads. “Call of Duty is in a class of its own,"" Koskoff said. Kristovich argued for Activision that the game, despite its vast numbers of players, can be tied to only a few of the many U.S. mass shootings. “The game is incredibly common. It appears in a scene on ‘The Office,’"" she said. She added that it is ridiculous to assert that “this is such a horrible scourge that your honor has to essentially ban it through this lawsuit.” Highberger told the lawyers he was not leaning in either direction before the hearing. He gave no time frame for when he will rule, but a quick decision is not expected. The judge did tell the plaintiffs' lawyers that their description of Activision's actions seemed like deliberate malfeasance, where their lawsuit alleges negligence. He said that was the biggest hurdle they needed to clear. “Their conduct created a risk of exactly what happened,” Mesner-Hage told him. “And we represent the people who are exactly the foreseeable victims of that conduct.” Meta's attorneys will make arguments on a similar motion next month.

The owner of the Tennessee factory where workers drowned after Hurricane Helene won't face charges,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/the-owner-of-the-tennessee-factory-where-workers-drowned-after-hurricane-helene-wont-face-charges-2025-07-18/,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — The owner of a factory where six workers died last year in flooding from Hurricane Helene won't face charges after a Tennessee Bureau of Investigation found no criminal wrongdoing. First Judicial District Attorney General Steven Finney announced the decision to close the case on Friday, saying no further action will be taken. The investigation found no evidence that Impact Plastics employees were told they could not leave the factory or that they would be fired if they left, according to a news release from the district attorney. It also found employees had a little more than an hour during which they could have evacuated from the Erwin, Tennessee, industrial park. The conclusion mirrors that of a similar investigation by the Tennessee Occupational Safety and Health Administration that found in April that workers had time to evacuate the premises, albeit by makeshift routes. A statement from Impact Plastics attorney Stephen Ross Johnson on Friday said company president and founder Gerald O’Connor welcomes the results of the TBI investigation. “The true and accurate facts are now known,” the statement reads. Five employees and one contractor who cleaned the offices once a week were killed on Sept. 27 after they were washed away by floodwaters. They were among 12 people who stuck close to the Impact Plastics building, waiting for the water to recede, after realizing the exit road was already submerged. When the water kept rising, they climbed onto the bed of a semitrailer loaded with giant spools of plastic piping that was parked outside the factory. When floodwaters eventually overwhelmed the truck, six people were able to use the piping for flotation and were later rescued. The other six drowned. The TOSHA report notes that several Impact Plastics employees did escape the flood. Some were able to drive or walk over an embankment to a nearby highway after workers at a neighboring business dismantled a fence there. Others escaped by driving over a makeshift path onto nearby railroad tracks that an employee at a neighboring business created with a tractor. Still others were able to escape by walking to the railroad tracks, according to that report. Although the criminal case is being closed, the company still faces a wrongful death lawsuit from the family of Johnny Peterson, and other civil suits are planned. Attorney Luke Widener, who represents the families of several flood victims, said in a statement that they “categorically disagree that Impact Plastics employees were given any meaningful opportunity to escape. ...Indeed, if Impact Plastics’ account were true, Bertha Mendoza, Sibrina Barnett, and the others who perished would still be with us.""

Why Pure Storage Is a Core Investment for the AI Era,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/why-pure-storage-is-a-core-investment-for-the-ai-era/,"The global economy is undergoing a data-driven transformation. Artificial intelligence (AI) is the engine powering this shift, turning raw information into tangible business value. This AI engine has an insatiable appetite, requiring instant access to immense datasets to function effectively. While market attention often focuses on AI software and semiconductor chips, a critical and foundational industry makes this entire revolution possible. This critical industry is the world of high-performance data infrastructure. Pure Storage NYSE: PSTG operates at this essential layer, providing the high-speed data delivery systems that modern AI demands. For investors seeking to capitalize on the durable trend of data growth, Pure Storage’s pivotal role reveals a compelling opportunity. The central challenge in any large-scale AI initiative is the speed of data access. No matter how sophisticated, an AI model is useless if it is stuck waiting for data to arrive. Traditional storage systems, built on spinning disks, are simply too slow for this new reality. They create performance bottlenecks that can cripple multi-million-dollar AI investments. Pure Storage’s all-flash technology platform directly solves this problem. Its products are engineered for extremely low latency (fast response times) and high throughput (rapid data transfer), which are essential for AI. The company’s latest product launches from June 2025 demonstrate a clear and aggressive focus on this high-growth market. Pure Storage has solidified its credibility in this space through a deep partnership with NVIDIA NASDAQ: NVDA, the leader in AI computing. Pure Storage’s systems are certified and integrated into NVIDIA’s official AI data center blueprints. This serves as a powerful signal to enterprise customers and investors alike: Pure Storage is a validated, trusted partner at the heart of the AI ecosystem. This technological leadership is a primary driver for capturing market share and supporting future revenue growth. A critical component of the investment case for Pure Storage is its successful transformation from a hardware vendor into a modern platform company. This shift, centered on high-margin subscription services, fundamentally enhances its value proposition to investors. Instead of relying on cyclical, one-time hardware sales, Pure Storage has built its business around predictable, recurring revenue. Its Enterprise Data Cloud vision embodies this strategy, which unifies a customer's entire data storage infrastructure into a single, automated platform. This provides customers with a simplified, cloud-like experience while securing stable, long-term revenue for Pure Storage. Wall Street heavily favors this model due to the high degree of revenue visibility and strong customer loyalty it creates. The company’s first-quarter fiscal 2026 financial results prove this strategy is working: Reinforcing this strategic direction, Pure Storage recently appointed Tarek Robbiati as its new Chief Financial Officer. His experience includes leading a similar as-a-service business transformation at Hewlett-Packard Enterprise NYSE: HPE, a move that signals Pure Storage is adding proven leadership to accelerate its most lucrative strategy. An effective strategy must ultimately translate into strong financial performance, and Pure Storage is delivering on this promise. The company’s latest earnings report depicts a business executing with both growth and discipline. For the quarter, revenue grew 12% to $778.5 million. More importantly, the company is profitable and generates significant cash, reporting a free cash flow of $211.6 million. Its reaffirmed full-year guidance reflects management’s confidence, which projects 11% revenue growth and a healthy 17.0% non-GAAP operating margin. The professional analyst community has taken note of this consistent execution. The consensus rating from 20 Wall Street analysts covering the stock is a Moderate Buy. Their average 12-month price target is $69.95, representing a healthy potential upside from current trading levels. This combination of strong operational results and a positive outlook from market experts provides a solid foundation for continued stock appreciation. Pure Storage is not a speculative bet on a future technology; it is a profitable, established leader that provides the essential data infrastructure on which today's AI economy is built. Its superior technology, a proven and expanding subscription business model, and a strong track record of financial discipline create a compelling and strategic growth opportunity for investors.

Trump's attacks on Powell threaten the Fed's independence. Here's why it matters,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trumps-attacks-on-powell-threaten-the-feds-independence-heres-why-it-matters-2025-07-18/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has opened up a new front in his attack on the Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell: He says the alledged mismanagement of a building renovation project could be grounds for firing Powell. Such an unprecedented step could send the financial markets into a tailspin and over time push up interest rates and weaken the U.S. economy. If investors start to worry the Fed is no longer independent, fewer may buy U.S. bonds, which would push up the interest rate on those bonds and lift borrowing costs more broadly. Trump has criticized Powell for months because the chair has kept the short-term interest rate the Fed controls at 4.3% this year, after cutting it three times last year. Powell says the Fed wants to see how the economy responds to Trump's sweeping tariffs on imports, which Powell says could push up inflation. Powell's caution has infuriated Trump, who has demanded the Fed cut borrowing costs to spur the economy and reduce the interest rates the federal government pays on its debt. Firing the Fed chair would threaten the Fed’s venerated independence, which has long been supported by most economists and Wall Street investors. Here are some questions and answers about the Fed. The Fed has been renovating its Washington, D.C. headquarters and a neighboring building. With some of the construction occurring underground and as building materials have soared in price after inflation spiked in 2021 and 2022, the estimated cost has ballooned to about $2.5 billion, from $1.9 trillion. When asked if the costly rebuilding could be grounds to fire Powell, Trump said recently, “I think it is.” “When you spend $2.5 billion on, really, a renovation, I think it’s really disgraceful,” Trump said. Yet in 2020, The Associated Press has reported, several Trump appointees to a local review commission pushed the Fed to include more marble in the renovation. Yet now White House officials and other critics of the project are pointing to the marble as a sign of extravagance. The Fed wields extensive power over the U.S. economy. By cutting the short-term interest rate it controls — which it typically does when the economy falters — the Fed can make borrowing cheaper and encourage more spending, accelerating growth and hiring. When it raises the rate — which it does to cool the economy and combat inflation — it can weaken the economy and cause job losses. Economists have long preferred independent central banks because they can more easily take unpopular steps to fight inflation, such as raise interest rates, which makes borrowing to buy a home, car, or appliance more expensive. The importance of an independent Fed was cemented for most economists after the extended inflation spike of the 1970s and early 1980s. Former Fed Chair Arthur Burns has been widely blamed for allowing the painful inflation of that era to accelerate by succumbing to pressure from President Richard Nixon to keep rates low heading into the 1972 election. Nixon feared higher rates would cost him the election, which he won in a landslide. Paul Volcker was eventually appointed chair of the Fed in 1979 by President Jimmy Carter, and he pushed the Fed's short-term rate to the stunningly high level of nearly 20%. (It is currently 4.3%). The eye-popping rates triggered a sharp recession, pushed unemployment to nearly 11%, and spurred widespread protests. Yet Volcker didn't flinch. By the mid-1980s, inflation had fallen back into the low single digits. Volcker's willingness to inflict pain on the economy to throttle inflation is seen by most economists as a key example of the value of an independent Fed. An effort to fire Powell would almost certainly cause stock prices to fall and bond yields to spike higher, pushing up interest rates on government debt and raising borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, and credit card debt. The interest rate on the 10-year Treasury is a benchmark for mortgage rates. Most investors prefer an independent Fed, partly because it typically manages inflation better without being influenced by politics but also because its decisions are more predictable. Fed officials often publicly discuss how they would alter interest rate policies if economic conditions changed. If the Fed was more swayed by politics, it would be harder for financial markets to anticipate — or understand — its decisions. Well, no. Fed chairs like Powell are appointed by the president to serve four-year terms, and have to be confirmed by the Senate. The president also appoints the six other members of the Fed's governing board, who can serve staggered terms of up to 14 years. Those appointments can allow a president over time to significantly alter the Fed's policies. Former president Joe Biden appointed five of the current seven members: Powell, Lisa Cook, Philip Jefferson, Adriana Kugler, and Michael Barr. As a result, Trump will have fewer opportunities to make appointments. He will be able to replace Kugler, whose term ends Jan. 31, 2026. Congress, meanwhile, can set the Fed's goals through legislation. In 1977, for example, Congress gave the Fed a “dual mandate” to keep prices stable and seek maximum employment. The Fed defines stable prices as inflation at 2%. The 1977 law also requires the Fed chair to testify before the House and Senate twice every year about the economy and interest rate policy. The Supreme Court earlier this year suggested in a ruling on other independent agencies that a president can't fire the chair of the Fed just because he doesn't like the chair's policy choices. But he may be able to remove him “for cause,” typically interpreted to mean some kind of wrongdoing or negligence. It's a likely reason the Trump administration has zeroed in on the building renovation, in hopes it could provide a “for cause” pretext. Still, Powell would likely fight any attempt to remove him, and the case could wind up at the Supreme Court. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

2025: A Pivotal Year for Smart Glasses As Meta Invests in Ray-Ban,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/2025-a-pivotal-year-for-smart-glasses-as-meta-invests-in-ray-ban/,"Meta Platforms NASDAQ: META has built what is indisputably one of the world’s most successful businesses, but that doesn’t mean there haven’t been flops along the way. Meta’s most notable miscalculation was its full-blown “metaverse” push back in 2021. Founder Mark Zuckerberg envisioned a world where people would communicate in avatar-centric virtual environments, eventually replacing smartphones. This caused the company to change its name to Meta from Facebook in October 2021. From then until the end of 2022, Meta shares lost approximately 62% of their value. Fortunately for Zuck, shares have roared up by a whopping 500% since the end of 2022, as of July 14. Shifting from the metaverse toward AI-enabled advertising was exactly what Meta needed. Still, the metaverse lives on through Meta’s Reality Labs segment, which Zuckerberg still sees as key to the company’s future. Evidencing this is the nearly 3% stake Meta has reportedly bought in EssilorLuxottica OTCMKTS: ESLOY, the maker of Ray-Ban and Oakley glasses. Meta makes smart glasses in collaboration with these two brands. So, what does this say about the future of Reality Labs, and can it become a positive contributor to the overall company? It is important to realize that Meta has succeeded over the past several years in spite of Reality Labs, not because of it. Over the last nine quarters, Reality Labs generated less than $4.5 billion in revenue and had an operating loss of approximately $38 billion. Meta’s investment in EssilorLuxottica doesn’t change this. But, it does signal how deep both firms' commitment to smart glasses is. Meta may now be one of the larger shareholders in EssilorLuxottica, especially as its stake could grow to 5%. This could give it some ability to influence EssilorLuxottica’s operations going forward. Given the two firms' long-standing collaboration on smart glasses, it is likely that EssilorLuxottica was aware of, or at least not opposed to, Meta’s investment. This signals that EssilorLuxottica is confident in the long-term future of smart glasses. They likely wouldn’t want Meta as a big shareholder if the two did not truly share a long-term strategic vision. At the same time, Meta is doubling down on Reality Labs. It is betting that EssilorLuxottica’s shares will rise based on the adoption of the tech that the two build together. The investment also signals that Meta is shifting its focus more toward smart glasses, as opposed to VR headsets. This is a good sign for the future of Reality Labs. For Reality Labs to become profitable, sales need to rise massively. The Vision Council estimates that around 85% of Americans wear non-prescription sunglasses. Thus, targeting this market is much more likely to bring the scale that Reality Labs needs as opposed to VR headsets. Additionally, smart glasses are for everyday use, while VR headsets cater to gaming and entertainment. This provides greater opportunities for the company to build other revenue streams, such as advertising or subscriptions, into the smart glasses. In 2024, Meta reportedly sold one million of its Ray-Ban smart glasses. Zuckerberg aims to increase this number to between two million and five million by 2025. However, in Q1, Reality Labs sales fell around 6% from the prior year quarter, putting the company solidly behind the eight ball when it comes to reaching this goal. Meta released its Oakley smart glasses in July and is planning another release with Prada. It's possible that these releases could help the overall segment, as Meta specifically targets athletic and luxury-oriented consumers. Meta’s returns over the past several years show that it hasn’t needed Reality Labs to be successful for the stock to appreciate. Given this, some might assume that Meta is playing with house money; any improvement in this part of the business will be beneficial to shares. However, a huge new competitor is rising up. Google parent company Alphabet NASDAQ: GOOG is partnering with Samsung Electronics OTCMKTS: SSNLF and Warby Parker NYSE: WRBY to release its own smart glasses in 2026. If their offering really takes off, Meta shares could get whacked. Thus, seeing strong sales growth in Meta’s smart glasses becomes ever more important in 2025. Reality Labs will almost certainly not achieve profitability anytime soon. However, building on its lead in smart glasses could add upside to shares. At the same time, failing to do so could prove costly. Before you consider EssilorLuxottica, you'll want to hear this.

Unity’s New Ad Solutions Drive Stock to 52-Week High,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/unitys-new-ad-solutions-drive-stock-to-52-week-high/,"Unity Software NYSE: U gave investors a reason to take notice in mid-July 2025. The company’s stock jumped over 14% to a new 52-week high. Unity’s stock price jump was powered by a trading volume of nearly 40 million shares, more than three times its daily average. The immediate trigger was a positive report from an analyst at Jefferies, who raised the stock's price target to $35 and held a firm Buy rating. The market’s positive reaction suggests a significant shift in investors' perception of the company. For months, the story surrounding Unity focused on a complex turnaround. Now, that story is changing, with a new focus on clear evidence that the company's strategy is working under its new leadership. The key question for investors is precisely what drives this powerful new wave of analyst optimism. The main reason for the renewed confidence is the accelerating momentum within Unity’s Grow Solutions segment. This division helps game developers attract new players and make money from their creations. It is the heart of Unity's turnaround story, and two recent developments show why analysts are taking notice. The first is the impressive performance of Unity Vector, the company’s new AI-powered advertising platform. In its first-quarter report, Unity revealed that Vector is already delivering a significant 15-20% performance lift for its advertisers. For investors, this is a critical update. In digital advertising, results are everything. When a platform delivers a higher return on ad spend, advertisers are motivated to increase their spending on it. This creates a positive cycle that drives high-margin revenue, a key part of Unity’s plan for long-term profitability. Unity is also thinking beyond its current success. In June 2025, the company launched the Unity Audience Hub, a new platform for creating highly targeted ad campaigns. This initiative is backed by major partners, including data firm Experian OTCMKTS: EXPGY and streaming giant Roku NASDAQ: ROKU. The Roku partnership is especially important. It enables Unity to sell ads on Connected TV (CTV) platforms, a large and growing part of the entertainment sector that currently lies outside Unity's traditional mobile gaming space. This strategic move signals a sophisticated plan to improve Unity's existing ad business and capture new sources of revenue. The exciting developments in Unity’s ad business are made more compelling by the stability and discipline seen across the entire company. The market is buying into the growth story now because it is built on a much stronger financial and operational foundation. A key part of this foundation is the health of Unity’s core Create Solutions business. The successful launch of the Unity 6 engine has helped rebuild trust with software developers after a controversial pricing change in 2023. This restored confidence is showing up in the company's financials. Revenue from high-margin subscriptions in this segment grew at a double-digit rate in the first quarter, providing a predictable and profitable base for the company. At the same time, the company's strategic portfolio reset, Unity’s plan to focus only on its most promising products, is showing clear results. The company’s first-quarter financial report highlighted several key improvements: These numbers provide tangible evidence that the company's focus on disciplined execution is paying off, lending credibility to its optimistic outlook. Unity’s recent stock rally represents a decisive vote of confidence from the market. The combination of a revitalized advertising business, a stable core engine, and proven financial discipline is painting a compelling picture of a company on the right track. While Unity is still completing its strategic shift away from less profitable business lines, the improvements seen today are setting the stage for an expected return to top-line revenue growth in the second half of 2025. As the benefits from Unity Vector and new partnerships build, the company's focus will likely continue to shift from recovery to expansion. The next major checkpoint for investors will be the second-quarter earnings report, expected in mid-August. This report will first test whether the company’s strong operational momentum can translate into accelerating financial performance. For Unity, the story is clearly shifting from a challenging turnaround to one of focused execution and credible, long-term growth potential.

Coldplay's jumbotron captures — what exactly? The internet has its theories,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/coldplays-jumbotron-captures--what-exactly-the-internet-has-its-theories-2025-07-18/,"LONDON (AP) — It started out as a routine bit of fun at a Coldplay concert: Lead singer Chris Martin asked the cameras to scan the crowd for his “Jumbotron Song,” when he sings a few lines about the people the camera lands on. At a concert at Gillette Stadium in Massachusetts on Wednesday, a man wearing a birthday sash was up first. Two people in banana costumes were highlighted. But in between, something else ensued. For several seconds, a couple was shown on the big screen. They were cuddling and smiling, his arms wrapped around her, as she leaned back into him. When they saw themselves on the big screen, her jaw dropped, her hands flew to her face and she spun away from the camera. He ducked out of the frame, as did she. “Either they’re having an affair or they’re just very shy,” Martin joked. But it didn't end there. The video went viral, and the internet got to work. The Associated Press could not immediately confirm the couple's identity. But internet sleuths allege he is the chief executive officer of a U.S.-based company, while she is the chief people officer — in other words, the head of human resources. A spokesman for the company did not respond when asked to confirm the identities of the people shown on camera. But he said in an email that a statement circulating online that was attributed to the chief executive was a “fake from a clearly labeled parody account.” The company later released a statement saying it had opened an investigation into the incident, but did not directly identify the employees. The woman didn’t respond to a request for comment on LinkedIn. The man's LinkedIn page appeared to be deactivated, and no other way of contacting him could be immediately found. A phone call to a number listed in an online directory under his name went straight to voicemail. Attempts to reach him through other numbers associated with his name in the directory were not successful. A representative for Coldplay said the band had no comment. It’s easy to miss, but most concert venues have signs informing the audience that they could be filmed during the event. Look for them on the walls when you arrive and around the bar areas or toilets. It’s common practice especially when bands like to use performances for music videos or concert films. The venue in this case, Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, also has a privacy policy online which states: “When you visit our location or attend or participate in an event at our location, we may capture your image, voice and/or likeness, including through the use of CCTV cameras and/or when we film or photograph you in a public location.” In the internet age, such videos — or ones taken on someone's smartphone — can quickly zip around the world. This video rocketed around social media, as people speculated about why the couple dodged the camera. Empathy for the pair and their families was mixed with plenty of snarky commentary and countless memes, with the fake statement from the chief executive generating a lot of additional vitriol. And news reports said that the CEO's LinkedIn account was disabled after it was flooded by a wave of comments. “It’s a little bit unsettling how easily we can be identified with biometrics, how our faces are online, how social media can track us — and how the internet has gone from being a place of interaction, to a gigantic surveillance system,"" said Mary Angela Bock, an associate professor in the University of Texas at Austin’s School of Journalism and Media. ""We are being surveilled by our social media. They’re tracking us in exchange for entertaining us.” _____ AP Business Writer Wyatte Grantham-Philips contributed to this report from New York.

'Women deserve to be at the table': The WNBA's signature shoe boom,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/women-deserve-to-be-at-the-table-the-wnbas-signature-shoe-boom-2025-07-18/,"INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Signature shoes are ready for their share of the Indianapolis spotlight at All-Star weekend. Bright orange All-Star editions of Sabrina Ionescu’s and A’ja Wilson’s newest sneakers dropped into their eager fans’ hands Thursday morning, joining the now legions of WNBA signature shoes on courts across the league. It’s the latest installation in a busy boom for WNBA signature sneakers. In the past three years, Breanna Stewart, Ionescu, and Wilson have all released signature shoes, with Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese signatures in the works. “We knew there would be an adoption, but we didn’t know it would be that fast and that grand,” Ben Nethongkome, the lead designer for Ionescu’s shoe with Nike, said of the growth of her line. “It’s been highly rewarding to see Nike really addressing the ask and need from that side of the game,” he added. “It’s great to hear the (male signature athletes) giving flowers, like, ‘Wow, women’s basketball is really growing in a beautiful way.’” StockX, a prominent force in the sneaker resale ecosystem, has been feeling the surge within sneakerhead culture. Sales of WNBA signature sneakers on their site jumped 938% from 2023 to 2024, and they are on pace to see year-over-year sales of them increase by double digits again this year. Brendan Dunne, senior director of customer community and engagement at StockX, called it “an explosion of interest.” But don’t mistake it as a new phenomenon. Call it a comeback. From 1995 to 2010, nine WNBA signature sneakers hit the shelves, led by original stars Sheryl Swoopes and Lisa Leslie. In the next 12 years, there was only one, from Elena Delle Donne. New York Liberty stars All-Stars Stewart and Ionescu were the first two active WNBA players to sign their new deals, with Puma and Nike, respectively, to end the drought and usher in this new era. The most recent Sabrinas and A'Ones, both with Nike, retail at $135 and $115, respectively. The most recent Stewies with Puma retail at $120. “When I was able to get mine, I understood the gravity of knowing it’s going to be a successful business, and showing the world that women deserve to be at the table talking about the signature shoe business,” Ionescu said. “They really can change the landscape of the sport.” Wilson's first model was released in May. “It’s been a dream come true,” the WNBA MVP said. “To see everybody in the community wear it, it warms my heart and it never gets old. I’m like, you really took the time to support me.” The Angel Reese 1s are the next drop on the signature shoe calendar, and the shoe's image and “Diamond Dust” colorway were revealed to the public earlier this month. The shoe will be officially launching in 2026. “I’m happy for that,” said basketball Hall of Famer Shaquille O’Neal, who has been a mentor for Reese. “She’s having fun. She represents our family.” “(The WNBA) is big, but it needs to become bigger,” he said. Nethongkome said that in comparison to the design style in the 1990s, which was more “bold and kind of in your face,” many sneakers in their new lines feature more hidden nods, like the slight vertical tip of the Nike logo on Ionescu’s shoe to represent the breaking of a glass ceiling or the lowercase ‘i’ on the heel. Those small design choices are representative of a larger trend in today’s new signatures.

Fashion startup founder charged with $300M fraud freed on $1M bail,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/fashion-startup-founder-charged-with-300-million-fraud-2025-07-18/,"NEW YORK (AP) — A former chief executive of two clothing technology companies was released on $1 million bail Friday after pleading not guilty to charges alleging she cheated investors of over $300 million over the past six years. Christine Hunsicker, 48, of Lafayette, New Jersey, was charged with six counts, including fraud, aggravated identity theft and false statement charges in the indictment in Manhattan federal court. U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton said in a release that Hunsicker forged documents, fabricated audits and made material misrepresentations about her company's financial condition to defraud investors in CaaStle Inc. and P180. The indictment said Hunsicker, once portrayed as an on-the-rise fashion entrepreneur, portrayed CaaStle as a high-growth, private company with substantial cash on hand when she knew it faced significant financial distress. In a statement, defense lawyers Michael Levy and Anna Skotko said prosecutors “have chosen to present to the public an incomplete and very distorted picture in today's indictment,” despite Hunsicker's efforts to be “fully cooperative and transparent” with prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange Commission. “There is much more to this story, and we look forward to telling it,” they said. Hunsicker did not comment as she left the courthouse with Skotko after entering the not-guilty plea and agreeing to the rules of her $1 million bail, which included not having any contact with former or current investors or employees. According to the indictment, Hunsicker continued her fraudulent scheme even after the CaaStle board of directors removed her and prohibited her from soliciting investments or taking other actions on the company's behalf. She “persisted in her scheme” even after law enforcement agents confronted her over the fraud, the indictment said. Before the fraud allegations emerged, Hunsicker seemed to be a rising star in the fashion world after she was named to Crain's New York Business “40 under 40” lists, was selected as one of Inc.'s “Most Impressive Women Entrepreneurs” and was recognized by the National Retail Federation as someone shaping the future of retail, the indictment noted. At a time when the business was in financial distress with limited cash available and significant expenses, CaaStle was valued by Hunsicker at $1.4 billion, the indictment said. Hunsicker was lying to investors in February 2019 and continued to do so through this March, prosecutors alleged. They said she fed investors falsely inflated income statements, fake audited financial statements, fictitious bank account records and sham corporate records. She allegedly told one investor in August 2023 that CaaStle reported an operating profit of nearly $24 million in the second quarter of 2023 when its operating profit that quarter was actually less than $30,000. The indictment alleged that she carried out the majority of the fraud by bilking CaaStle investors of $275 million before forming P180 last year to infuse CaaStle with cash before its investors could discover her fraud. Through misrepresentations and omissions, she cheated P180 investors out of about $30 million, the indictment said. It said CaaStle filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy last month, leaving hundreds of investors holding now-worthless CaaStle shares. Hunsicker was forced to resign from CaaStle's board in December and formally resigned as chief executive in March. In a related civil filing, the SEC said Hunsicker's “fake financials” supported her narrative that CaaStle was nearing an initial public offering or sale in late 2022 as it enjoyed rapid and steady revenue growth after launching a new monetization model called “Clothing-as-a-Service.” “In reality, CaaStle's revenues were shrinking, its losses were increasing, and the company was never profitable,” the lawsuit said. “Not a single existing or prospective CaaStle investor received accurate monthly, quarterly, or annual CaaStle financial statements from Hunsicker.” Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

Education Department will release some frozen grants supporting after-school and summer programs,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/education-department-will-release-some-frozen-grants-supporting-after-school-and-summer-programs-2025-07-18/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Education Department will release $1.3 billion in previously withheld grant money for after-school programs, days after 10 Republican senators sent a letter imploring the Trump administration to allow frozen education money to be sent to states. President Donald Trump’s administration on July 1 withheld more than $6 billion in federal grants for after-school and summer programs, adult literacy and English language instruction, part of a review to ensure spending aligned with the White House’s priorities. In a letter sent Wednesday, Republican senators said the withheld money supported programs that had longstanding bipartisan support and were critical to local communities. The money had been appropriated by Congress in a bill that was signed by Trump. “We share your concern about taxpayer money going to fund radical left-wing programs,” the senators wrote to the Office of Management and Budget. “However, we do not believe that is happening with these funds.” The administration's review of the 21st Century Community Learning Centers, which support after-school and summer programming, has been completed, a senior official said Friday. The person declined to be identified so they could share progress from the review. That funding will be released to states, the official said. The rest of the withheld grants, close to $5 billion, continues to be reviewed for bias by the Office of Management and Budget. Without the money, school districts and nonprofits such as the YMCA and Boys and Girls Club of America had said they would have to close or scale back educational offerings this fall. The money being released Friday pays for free programming before and after school and during the summer. The programs provide child care so low-income parents can work, and they give options to families who live in rural areas with few other child care providers. Beyond just child care, kids receive reading and math help at the programs, along with enrichment in science and the arts. Despite the money's release Friday, schools and nonprofits have already been disrupted by two weeks of uncertainty. Some programs have made plans to close, and others have fallen behind on hiring and contracting for the fall. “While we are thrilled the funds will be made available,"" said Jodi Grant, executive director of the Afterschool Alliance, “the administration’s inexplicable delay in disbursing them caused massive chaos and harm."" Many after-school programs had canceled plans to open in the fall, she said. On Monday, more than 20 states had filed a lawsuit challenging the $6 billion funding freeze, including the money for English language instruction, teacher development and adult literacy that remains on hold. The lawsuit, led by California, argued withholding the money was unconstitutional and many low-income families would lose access to critical after-school care if the grants were not released. David Schuler, executive director of AASA, an association of school superintendents, praised the release of after-school money but said that the remaining education funding should not be withheld. “Districts should not be in this impossible position where the Administration is denying funds that had already been appropriated to our public schools, by Congress,” Schuler said in a statement. “The remaining funds must be released immediately — America’s children are counting on it.” Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-West Virginia, who chairs the Senate Appropriations subcommittee that oversees education spending, led the letter sent this week by Republican senators, protesting the funding freeze. The letter called for the rest of the money to be released, including funds for adult education and teaching English as a second language. “The decision to withhold this funding is contrary to President Trump’s goal of returning K-12 education to the states,” the senators wrote. “This funding goes directly to states and local school districts, where local leaders decide how this funding is spent.” Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, called on the White House to release the rest of the money. “At this very moment, schools nationwide are crunching the numbers to figure out how many teachers they will need to lay off as Trump continues to hold up billions in funding,” Murray said Friday in a statement. “Every penny of this funding must flow immediately.” ____ The Associated Press’ education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Why Abbott Laboratories Is a Q2 2025 Buy: Growth & Yield,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/why-abbott-laboratories-is-a-q2-2025-buy-growth-and-yield/,"If you wonder whether Abbott Laboratories NYSE: ABT is a good buy in Q2 2025, the answer is yes. The company’s management, portfolio, cash flow, capital return, and pipeline are why. The stock price came under pressure in July because the Q3 guidance update wasn’t better than what the market expected. Sound crazy, but it's true: the robust outlook wasn’t enough to keep speculators interested, but it isn’t the speculators that matter in the long term. What matters in the long term is that the company’s growth trajectory is positive, supporting a robust capital outlook that includes dividends and share repurchases. The combination of business growth, dividend distribution growth, and share repurchases serves as a lever for shareholder value that will propel the stock price to new highs.  And the capital return is significant. The dividend is worth approximately 1.8% as of mid-July, is less than 50% of the earnings outlook, and has grown at a robust 10% CAGR over the past few years. Those are robust metrics for a Dividend Aristocrat, especially for a Dividend King like Abbott, which has increased its payout for over 50 years. That is a testament to management's foresight and execution, qualities that will continue to benefit investors in the long term. Abbott’s share repurchases are also significant, as they reduce the share count quarterly. The company reduced its share count incrementally in the first half of the year and is expected to continue reducing it through the end of the year. Abbott Laboratories had a solid quarter, with revenue growth topping 7.4%, reported, about 70 basis points better than expected, driven by strength in all regions and reporting segments. Organically, growth was reported at 6.9% and 7.5% excluding COVID-19 testing supplies. Regionally, the U.S. was strongest at 8.7%, but the International Market was also solid at 6.6%. Segmentally, Diagnostics was the only weak point but was impacted by COVID, declining on a reported basis but rising incrementally organically. Other segments grew by at least 3%, led by a strong, industry-leading 12% gain in Medical Devices. The margin news is also good. Revenue leverage and operational quality offset macroeconomic pressures, resulting in a 100-basis-point improvement in adjusted gross and operating margins. The net result is $1.26 in adjusted earnings, only as expected, but up a leveraged 10.5% compared to the slower 7.4% top-line growth. The critical takeaway is that the cash flow is sufficient to sustain the capital return outlook, balance sheet health, and pipeline advancement, which support the stock price action over time. Regarding the pipeline, the company reported advancement of several key studies and one major approval for the quarter. Guidance is the sticking point for market action in July. The company narrowed its revenue growth range, indicating solid growth of 7.5% to 8%, with earnings in line with the consensus figure. However, a stronger catalyst was needed to lift the share prices. Investors should focus on growth, earnings, cash flow, and the pipeline, which promises to sustain them all. The analysts' trends are supportive of Abbott’s stock price. The group issued a steady string of upgrades and price target revisions up to the day of the release, resulting in increasing coverage, firming sentiment, and a rising consensus price target. The group has the stock pegged at Moderate Buy with a bullish bias, forecasting a 10% increase relative to the pre-release closing price. That is sufficient to put this market at a new all-time high when reached. Before you consider Abbott Laboratories, you'll want to hear this.

"Trump signs new stablecoin regulations into law, a major milestone for crypto industry",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-signs-new-stablecoin-regulations-into-law-a-major-milestone-for-crypto-industry-2025-07-18/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Friday signed into law new regulations for a type of cryptocurrency, a major milestone for an industry that has spent heavily to strengthen its legitimacy and political might. The GENIUS Act sets initial guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins, which are tied to assets like the U.S. dollar to reduce price volatility compared with other forms of cryptocurrency. It passed both the House and Senate with wide bipartisan margins. The new law is meant to bolster consumer confidence in the crypto industry, which has quickly become a major power player in Washington thanks to massive campaign donations and spending on lobbying. Its passage comes as Trump had repeatedly pledged to make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the world.” “For years you were mocked and dismissed and counted out,"" Trump told crypto industry executives at a White House bill signing attended by about 200 people, including several top GOP lawmakers. “This signing is a massive validation of your hard work and your pioneering spirit.” The crypto industry has long complained it was unfairly targeted by former President Joe Biden's administration and spent heavily to help Trump win last year's election. The president lavished praise on crypto leaders during his speech Friday, saying “nobody has gained the respect in such a short period of time.” Trump said helping the cryptocurrency industry was “good for the dollar and it’s good for the country.” “That’s why I backed you at an early stage,” said Trump, who had previously been a skeptic of cryptocurrency before embracing it. His administration has taken several early steps to boost the crypto industry, including the Securities and Exchange Commission dropping several enforcement actions against large crypto companies. Trump then added a candid admission about the political calculus of his support for the crypto industry: “And I also did it for the votes,” he said, drawing laughter from the audience. The president also joked that lawmakers had named the GENIUS Act after him. The acronym stands for “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins.” The use of stablecoins has grown dramatically in recent years. Circle, the U.S.-based issuer of one of the most popular cryptocurrencies, made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange earlier this year and quickly saw its value soar amid heavy interest from crypto enthusiasts and investors. Stablecoin issuers make profits by collecting the interest on the assets they hold in reserve to back their stablecoins. A provision in the GENIUS Act bans members of Congress and their families from profiting off stablecoins. But that prohibition does not extend to the president and his family, even as Trump builds a crypto empire from the White House. His family holds a significant stake in World Liberty Financial, a crypto project that launched its own stablecoin earlier this year and received an early boost from an investment fund in the United Arab Emirates. The House also passed two other bills Thursday that are meant to help the crypto industry. One creates a new market structure for cryptocurrency, and the other bans the Federal Reserve from issuing a new digital currency. Both measures now go to the Senate.

"Judge restores Democrat to Federal Trade Commission, ruling her firing by Trump was illegal",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/judge-restores-democrat-to-federal-trade-commission-ruling-her-firing-by-trump-was-illegal-2025-07-18/,"A federal judge has restored a Democrat to the Federal Trade Commission, ruling that President Donald Trump illegally fired her earlier this year in his efforts to exert control over independent agencies across the government. U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan ruled late Thursday that federal law protects FTC commissioners from being removed by the president without cause, citing a key 1935 U.S. Supreme Court decision involving the FTC. The decision allows Rebecca Kelly Slaughter to resume her duties as commissioner. The FTC website had been updated by Friday morning to show that Slaughter is among four sitting commissioners. Attorneys for the Trump administration almost immediately declared their intent to appeal, and the case could make its way to the Supreme Court. The conservative-led court already has narrowed the reach of the 90-year-old decision, known as Humphrey’s Executor, and some justices have called for overturning it altogether. The high court also permitted Trump to fire the heads of other independent agencies. In May, the court allowed Trump to remove members of the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board, despite lower court rulings that Humphrey’s Executor should protect them from arbitrary dismissal. The justices are currently weighing an emergency appeal from the administration to oust three Democratic members of the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Trump fired them in May, but a federal judge restored them to their positions a month later. The legal fight over the firings also could extend to the Federal Reserve and the prospect of Trump firing Fed chairman Jerome Powell. The justices suggested in May that Trump may not have the same freedom to upend the leadership of the Fed, describing it as “a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity.” In her opinion, AliKhan said she was required to abide by the Humphrey’s Executor decision, in which the court rebuffed President Franklin Roosevelt and held that FTC commissioners could be removed only for cause, not at the president’s whim. She said her ruling would uphold “clearly established law that has been enacted by a coequal branch of government, reaffirmed by another coequal branch, and acquiesced to by thirteen executives over the course of ninety years.” But the judge acknowledged that hers probably would not be the last word. “Defendants are, of course, free to take their quarrels with Humphrey’s Executor to the Supreme Court. This court has no illusions about where this case’s journey leads,” she wrote. Trump fired Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya, the commission’s two Democratic members in March. The FTC is a regulator created by Congress that enforces consumer protection measures and antitrust legislation. Its seats typically include three members of the president’s party and two from the opposing party. The commissioners sued to reclaim their jobs, saying they’d been dismissed illegally. Slaughter has four years left in her term as commissioner. Bedoya submitted his resignation in June, and AliKhan dismissed his claim as a result. “As the Court recognized today, the law is clear, and I look forward to getting back to work,” Slaughter said in a statement Thursday. During a May court hearing in federal court in Washington, D.C., plaintiffs’ attorneys warned against granting the president “absolute removal power over any executive officer,” saying it would effectively eliminate an important check on his power. “That has never been the case in this country,” said attorney Aaron Crowell. “That’s not the law. That has never been the law.” A politicized FTC also could favor powerful corporations while driving up prices for consumers, the lawyers for the fired commissioners said. But attorneys for the Trump administration argued that the FTC’s role has expanded since the 1930s, and as such, its members should answer directly to the president. “The president should be able to remove someone who is actively blocking his policies, for example,” Justice Department lawyer Emily Hall said during the hearing. AliKhan, who was nominated to the federal bench by President Joe Biden in 2023, noted the long line of presidents before Trump who didn’t try to push the limits. Commissioners are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. They serve seven-year terms that are staggered to prevent multiple vacancies at once. They can be fired for displaying specific bad behaviors, including inefficiency, neglect of duty and malfeasance in office. Trump told Bedoya and Slaughter that he was dismissing them because their service on the commission was inconsistent with his administration’s priorities, according to the lawsuit.
