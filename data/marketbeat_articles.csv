Asian shares are mostly higher after China-US talks end without a trade deal,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/asian-shares-are-mostly-higher-after-china-us-talks-end-without-a-trade-deal-2025-07-30/,"BANGKOK (AP) — Shares in Asia were mostly higher on Wednesday after the U.S. and China ended their latest round of trade talks without a deal. U.S, futures edged higher while oil prices slipped. Beijing’s top trade official said China and the United States agreed during two days of talks in Stockholm, Sweden, to work on extending an Aug. 12 deadline for imposing higher tariffs on each other. The U.S. side said an extension was discussed, but not decided on. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer says the American team would head back to Washington and “talk to the president about whether that’s something that he wants to do.” A Friday deadline is looming for many of Trump’s proposed tariffs on other countries. Several highly anticipated economic reports are also on the way, including the latest monthly update on the job market. “Markets had been floating on a cloud of trade optimism — first Japan, then the EU — but the sugar high is wearing off. Now, with U.S.-China talks dragging on in Stockholm, there’s a growing sense that the momentum is stalling,” Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index shed 0.3% to 25,441.64 while the Shanghai Composite index gained 0.5% to 3,628.53. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index edged less than 0.1% higher to 40,687.17. Gains for electronics companies were offset by losses for major exporters like Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 climbed 0.6% to 8,759.20 and in South Korea, the Kospi gained 0.9% to 3,259.00. Taiwan's Taiex rose 0.9% while the Sensex in India edged 0.1% higher. On Tuesday, U.S. stock indexes edged back from their record levels as a busy week for Wall Street picked up momentum. The S&P 500 fell 0.3% to 6,370.86, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.5% to 44,632.99. The Nasdaq composite was down 0.4% at 21,098.29. SoFi Technologies jumped 7.4%, but Merck dropped 2.2% and UPS sank 9.2% following a torrent of profit reports from big U.S. companies. They’re among the hundreds of companies telling investors this week how much they made during the spring, including nearly a third of the stocks in the S&P 500 index. UnitedHealth Group dropped 5.8% after reporting a profit for the spring that fell short of analysts’ expectations. It also gave a forecast for profit over all of 2025 that investors found disappointing. The health care giant said it expected to earn at least $16 per share, when analysts were looking for something close to $20, according to FactSet. Shares of Novo Nordisk that trade in the United States tumbled 21.3% after the Danish company cut its forecast for sales growth this year, in part because of lower expectations for its Wegovy weight-loss drug amid high competition. Treasury yields sank as the Federal Reserve began a two-day meeting on interest rates. Despite pressure from President Donald Trump for lower rates, which would give the economy a boost, the widespread expectation is that the Fed will wait for more data about how Trump’s tariffs are affecting inflation and the economy before making its next move. The U.S. economy appears to be slowing. One report on Tuesday said that U.S. employers were advertising fewer job openings at the end of June than a month before, though still more than economists expected. A separate report said confidence rose among U.S. consumers, but a measure of their expectations about the near term remains below the level that typically signals a recession ahead. In other dealings early Wednesday, U.S. benchmark crude oil picked up 7 cents to $69.28 per barrel, while Brent crude, the international standard, was up 13 cents at $71.82 per barrel. The dollar fell to 148.13 Japanese yen from 148.48 yen. The euro rose to $1.1554 from $1.1546. ___ AP Business Writers Matt Ott and Stan Choe contributed.

NTSB launches hearings on deadly Washington collision between a helicopter and passenger plane,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/ntsb-launches-hearings-on-deadly-washington-collision-between-a-helicopter-and-passenger-plane-2025-07-29/,"Three days of investigative hearings on the deadly midair collision over Washington in January begin Wednesday and aim to reveal new insights into what caused the crash between a passenger plane and an Army helicopter that killed 67 people. The National Transportation Safety Board will question witnesses and investigators about how the actions of the Federal Aviation Administration and its air traffic controllers and the Army may have contributed to the nation's deadliest plane crash since November 2001. It's likely too early for the board to identify the cause of the crash. The American Airlines plane from Wichita, Kansas collided with a Black Hawk helicopter while coming into land at Ronald Reagan National Airport and was the first in a string of crashes and near misses this year that have alarmed officials and the travelling public, despite statistics that still show flying remains the safest form of transportation. Investigations have already shown the FAA failed to recognize a troubling history of 85 near misses around Reagan airport in the years before the collision, and that the Army's helicopters routinely flew around the nation's capitol with a key piece of locating equipment, known as ADS-B Out, turned off. Aviation attorney Bob Clifford, who is working to file one of the first lawsuits against the government next month, said he hopes NTSB will look beyond the immediate factors that caused this crash to highlight the bigger ongoing concerns in the crowded Washington airspace. “In this particular instance, there’s a much broader picture. And that is the known problems that were being ignored about an unsafe environment for the commercial aircraft to be navigating with the military aviation helicopters in the area,” Clifford said. Even though the final NTSB report won't be released until sometime next year, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz isn't waiting to propose changes. He introduced legislation Tuesday that would require all aircraft operators to use both forms of ADS-B, or Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast, the technology to broadcast aircraft location data to other planes and air traffic controllers. Most aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B Out equipment but the airlines would have to add the more comprehensive ADS-B In technology to their planes. “There cannot be a double standard in aviation safety,” Cruz said. “We should not tolerate special exceptions for military training flights, operating in congested air space.” The legislation would revoke an exemption on ADS-B transmission requests for Department of Defense aircrafts. It also would require the FAA to evaluate helicopter routes near airports and require the Army Inspector General to review the Army’s aviation safety practices. NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said her agency has been recommending that move for decades after several other crashes. “In 2008, we sent a letter to FAA stating the board believes that the equipage of aircraft with ADS-B In capability will provide — and I want to stress this — an immediate and substantial contribution to safety, especially during operations in and around airports,” she said. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said that while he’d like to discuss “a few tweaks,” the legislation is “the right approach.” He also suggested that the previous administration “was asleep at the wheel” amid dozens of near-misses in the airspace around Washington's airspace. “In the past, people became complacent — leaders became complacent” Duffy said. Homendy said the hearings over the next few days will be a “fact-finding proceeding.” In addition, the NTSB will also post thousands of pages of evidence from the crash investigation online Wednesday morning. FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford said that he expects “we’re going to have some very uncomfortable conversations over the next two and a half days” but that “they need to be had in the clear light of day – and simply put the best interest of the traveling public ahead of any of our personal interests, perhaps.” The hearings in Washington will involve NTSB board members, investigators and witnesses for organizations involved in the crash. Panels will focus on military helicopter routes in the Washington area, collision avoidance technology and training for air traffic controllers at Ronald Reagan National Airport, among other subjects. Federal officials have also raised concerns over the nation’s outdated. and understaffed air traffic control system. During January’s mid-air crash above Washington, one controller was handing both commercial airline and helicopter traffic at the busy airport. Duffy has announced a multi-billion-dollar plan to overhaul the system controllers use that relies on old technology like floppy disks. ___ Associated Press writers Leah Askarinam, Ben Finley and Rio Yamat contributed to this story.

Wisconsin man pleads guilty to smuggling lab equipment to Russian companies,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/wisconsin-man-pleads-guilty-to-smuggling-lab-equipment-to-russian-companies-2025-07-29/,"MADISON, Wis. (AP) — A Wisconsin man pleaded guilty Tuesday to smuggling lab equipment to Russian companies in violation of trade sanctions the United States imposed after Russia invaded Ukraine. Federal prosecutors charged Andrew Pogosyan, a 68-year-old Russian-born U.S. citizen who lives in Madison, in June in a four-count information with conspiracy to defraud the United States and smuggling goods out of the country. According to the information, Pogosyan started using his company, Omega Diagnostics LLC, in September 2022 to ship lab equipment to Russian companies, including one that that performed chemical research for the Russian military. The U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security imposed sanctions in February 2022 on exports to Russia in response to the Ukrainian invasion. The sanctions require exporter to obtain special licenses to ship technology and goods to Russia, particularly products that could help Russia produce chemical and biological weapons. According to prosecutors, Pogosyan did not obtain a license and tried to conceal his exports' ultimate destination by sending them to third-party countries, including Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkey, Latvia, and Lithuania. The products were then forwarded on to the Russian companies. Pogosyan faces up to 35 years in prison when he's sentenced Oct. 7. His attorney, William Coffield, said in an email to The Associated Press on Monday afternoon that Pogosyan is a good person and didn't appreciate the seriousness of the sanctions. He added that Pogosyan's customers were scientists working on medical and other non-military research. “He has accepted responsibility,"" Coffield said, “and is working to make amends.” Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

Federal Reserve likely to air divisions as it keeps rates unchanged,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/federal-reserve-likely-to-air-divisions-as-it-keeps-rates-unchanged-2025-07-29/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Two top Federal Reserve officials could dissent from the central bank’s likely decision Wednesday to hold its key interest rate steady, a sign of division at the Fed that reflects the economy's muddy outlook and possibly the jockeying to replace Chair Jerome Powell when his term ends in May 2026. Based on their public comments in the past two months, it's possible that governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman could vote against leaving the short-term rate at about 4.3%. If so, it would be the first time two governors have dissented in over three decades. The division could be a preview of what might happen after Powell steps down, if President Donald Trump appoints a replacement who pushes for the much lower interest rates the White House desires. Other Fed officials could push back if a future chair sought to cut rates by more than economic conditions would otherwise support. For now, any dissent also would likely reflect that there are at least two different ways to see the U.S. economy, which is clearly in flux. The first is the way that most Fed officials have described it: Unemployment is at a low 4.1%, while the economy is growing, albeit modestly, and inflation did tick up in June, largely because of tariffs. So, the thinking goes, why not stand pat on rates and see what happens next? If inflation continues to worsen, a rate cut could make things worse — the Fed typically raises borrowing costs to combat inflation. And as long as the economy is doing well, there is no need to cut to support growth. The other view is more worrisome: There are signs the economy is weakening, such as sluggish hiring, slower consumer spending, and pretty modest overall growth. The economy, in the first six months of the year, probably expanded at an annual rate of about 1.5%. At the same time, tariffs have lifted inflation by less than many economists expected, so far. This is the view of the economy that Waller sketched out in a speech earlier this month. “Private-sector payroll growth is near stall speed,” Waller said. “We should not wait until the labor market deteriorates before we cut the policy rate.” When the Fed cuts its rate, it often — but not always — leads to lower borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans and credit cards. Some economists agree with Waller's concerns about the job market. Excluding government hiring, the economy added just 74,000 jobs in June, with most of those gains occurring in health care. “We are in a much slower job hiring backdrop than most people appreciate,” said Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at PGIM Fixed Income. Waller was appointed to the Fed's seven-member governing board by Trump during the president's first term. He has often been mentioned as a potential replacement for Powell. Waller has underscored in several speeches that he does not think Trump's tariffs will lead to persistently higher inflation. Bowman, the vice chair for regulation, was also appointed during Trump's first term. She suggested in June that the Fed should soon reduce borrowing costs. Bowman is also a possible Powell replacement, though more of a long shot. Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan Chase, said in a note to clients this week if the pair were to dissent, “it would say more about auditioning for the Fed chair appointment than about economic conditions.” The Fed's two-day meeting comes after a week of extraordinary interactions with the Trump White House, which has accused Powell of mismanaging an extensive, $2.5 billion renovation of two office buildings. Trump suggested two weeks ago that the rising cost for the project could be a “firing offense” but has since backed off that characterization. Notably, Trump argues that the Fed should cut because the economy is doing very well, which is a different viewpoint than nearly all economists, who say that a healthy, growing economy doesn't need rate cuts. “If your economy is hot, you're supposed to have higher short-term rates,” Porcelli said.

Civil rights agency sued over handling of transgender worker discrimination complaints under Trump,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/civil-rights-agency-sued-over-handling-of-transgender-worker-discrimination-complaints-under-trump-2025-07-29/,"Legal groups sued the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Tuesday, claiming it is unlawfully refusing to enforce federal workplace protections for transgender workers. Led by Acting Chair Andrea Lucas, a Republican, the federal agency charged with enforcing laws against workplace discrimination has moved swiftly to comply with President Donald Trump's executive order declaring two unchangeable sexes. Under Lucas’s leadership, the EEOC has dropped several lawsuits on behalf of transgender workers, stalled progress on some new cases, and subjected others to heightened scrutiny. The lawsuit also alleges that the agency halted payments to state and local civil rights agencies for investigating gender identity discrimination claims. “For over 60 years, the EEOC’s mandate has been to protect workers from discrimination, not to pick and choose who is deemed worthy of protection based on political interference,” said Skye Perryman, the president and CEO of Democracy Forward, which alongside the National Women’s Law Center brought the case on behalf of Maryland LGBTQ+ advocacy group FreeState Justice. “The Trump-Vance administration’s unlawful effort to erase protections for transgender people is cruel, and a violation of the law and the Constitution,” Perryman continued in an emailed statement. The EEOC declined to comment on the lawsuit, and instead referred The Associated Press to the Department of Justice. The DOJ did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Lucas, who is named in the lawsuit filed in Maryland U.S. District Court in Baltimore, has said that one of her priorities as Acting Chair would be “defending the biological and binary reality of sex and related rights.” Last month she defended her decision to drop several lawsuits on behalf of transgender workers during her June 18 Senate committee confirmation hearing, saying her agency is not independent and must comply with the president's orders. “It was impossible to both comply with the president’s executive order as an executive branch agency, and also zealously defend the workers we had brought the case on behalf,” she said. However, Lucas acknowledged that a 2020 Supreme Court ruling — Bostock v. Clayton County — “did clearly hold that discriminating against someone on the basis of sex included firing an individual who is transgender or based on their sexual orientation.” Plaintiffs argue that although the Bostock precedent “cemented protections for LGBTQ+ workers that the EEOC had already recognized for years” the agency has now “foreclosed transgender workers from the full set of charge investigation and other enforcement protections available to cisgender charging parties and categorically refuses to fully enforce the laws protecting against workplace sex discrimination tied to gender identity.” The lawsuit, which cites two Associated Press reports detailing EEOC actions related to LGBTQ+ workers, alleges that the EEOC’s “Trans Exclusion Policy” violates Supreme Court precedent, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Fifth Amendment’s Equal Protection guarantee, and the Administrative Procedure Act. “Instead of serving its critical role to prevent discrimination in the workplace, the EEOC, under Andrea Lucas’ leadership, is actually promoting discrimination,” said Gaylynn Burroughs, Vice President for Education and Workplace Justice at NWLC, in an emailed statement about the lawsuit. “Transgender workers deserve to be protected against harassment, and the EEOC is obligated to do so under law. But the Trump administration seems hellbent on bullying transgender people in every possible way and ensuring that they are pushed out of all forms of public life, including their workplaces, so we’re taking the administration to court.” ________ The Associated Press’ women in the workforce and state government coverage receives financial support from Pivotal Ventures.

Should Investors Lock Arms With Buffett and Dive Into POOL Stock?,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/should-investors-lock-arms-with-buffett-and-dive-into-pool-stock/,"Warren Buffett is one of the most successful investors of all time, with many market participants closely watching the Oracle of Omaha's stock picks. While markets focus on flashy artificial intelligence plays, Buffett is staying true to form. Through Berkshire Hathaway NYSE: BRK.B, he’s quietly built a position in a little-discussed name. That stock is Pool NASDAQ: POOL, the world’s largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool supplies, equipment, and related leisure products. The firm’s relatively unexciting industry begs the question: what does Buffett see in this consumer discretionary stock? The investment was at least somewhat validated after the company’s latest earnings, as shares spiked afterward. Below, we’ll detail Berkshire’s investment history, looking to understand whether it still sees value in this name. We’ll examine the company’s latest results and posit why Berkshire invested in the stock. Ultimately, does Pool represent a compelling investment? According to Berkshire’s 13F SEC filings, the company initiated a position in Pool back in Q3 2024 of around 404,000 shares. During that quarter, Pool’s average closing price was around $342, indicating that Berkshire saw the stock as a good buy near this level. Berkshire continued purchasing shares in Q4 2024 and Q1 2025. In Q1 2025, Pool’s average price was $336, but it closed as low as $317. As shares fell, Berkshire massively increased its stake. At the end of Q1, Berkshire held 1,464,000 shares, a 145% increase versus Q4 2024. As of the July 28 close, Pool trades at $321. This figure is below the stock’s lowest closing price in Q1, the quarter when Berkshire added around 865,000 shares to its position. All else equal, this indicates that investors have not missed out on whatever opportunity Berkshire saw in Pool. So, what do Pool’s latest results tell investors about the company, and why was Berkshire comfortable having approximately $466 million invested in the name at the end of Q1? In Q2, Pool’s sales came in nearly in line at $1.78 billion for a growth rate of just under 1%. However, the stock did manage a moderate beat on adjusted earnings per share (EPS), with the figure coming in at $5.17. This growth rate was approximately 3.8%, compared to expectations of 2.8% growth. Despite this beat, the company adjusted the midpoint of its full-year EPS guidance down 2.2% to $11.05. Overall, the firm’s results suggest it is doing a better-than-expected job of managing costs, but a weak demand environment is weighing on expectations. This comes as pool construction is in a downturn, and the company doesn’t expect a rebound in 2025. High interest rates are affecting this. They reduce housing turnover, and people often build pools when they switch homes. Shares spiked as much as 8% on July 24 after the results, but closed up only around 3%. Known as a long-term investor, Buffett is likely betting on a long-term trend toward swimming pools becoming a larger part of society. Driving this trend is the fact that scientists estimate that average global temperatures will increase by between 0.5 °C (0.9 °F) and nearly 5 °C (9 °F) by the year 2100. The company says that new pool construction makes up only about 15% of sales. Still, it's crucial for long-term growth. New pools expand the customer base to which the firm can sell its pool maintenance products. This allows the company to generate higher recurring sales over time, which drives the majority of its revenue. Pool also notes population migration to warmer Southern U.S. states as a long-term growth driver. Indeed, the last Census found that the South was the fastest-growing region in the country. Since 2000, the average monthly effective federal funds rate has been around 2%. Currently, it is at 4.33%. This suggests there could be a significant reversion back to these average levels in the long term. If this happens, pool construction should recover, benefiting demand for the ancillary pool products the company sells and thus shares. Should the trend of rising temperatures continue, this adds a powerful long-term tailwind to Pool stock. Wall Street analysts see very limited 12-month upside potential in Pool shares. However, as Berkshire is likely betting on, the stock has a significant opportunity to appreciate over an extended time frame if the trends discussed above come to fruition.

Assisted-living facility where fire killed 10 temporarily lost certification for mistreatment,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/assisted-living-facility-where-fire-killed-10-temporarily-lost-certification-for-mistreatment-2025-07-29/,"A Massachusetts assisted-living facility where a fire killed 10 people earlier this month temporarily lost its certification nearly a decade ago due to resident mistreatment, according to state regulators. The documents obtained by The Associated Press show the staff failed to treat residents with “consideration, respect, personal dignity and privacy."" Other specific details of what prompted the monthlong suspension were redacted in documents the state Executive Office of Aging & Independence provided Tuesday. The facility in Fall River was barred from accepting new residents until it took corrective action. The report adds to a list of issues raised with the Gabriel House facility over the years. A resident filed a lawsuit recently alleging the facility was not properly managed, staffed or maintained and that “emergency response procedures were not put in place.” The son of another resident said an elevator had been out for as long as nine months at one point. The state’s deadliest blaze in more than four decades has highlighted the lack of regulations governing assisted-living facilities that often care for low-income or disabled residents. Gov. Maura Healey declined last week to weigh in on the efficacy of state and local inspections. Instead, Healey has touted that a state commission is currently working on recommendations to improve assisted-living facilities. State records released Tuesday include about two dozen complaints about the facility during the last decade, including several related to “abuse, neglect or financial exploitation"" but details are redacted. Other complaints involved a resident getting stuck for hours in an elevator that was then out of service for months, and staff members who threatened residents and withheld medication. There also were complaints about a nurse withholding medication, “environmental safety” and a cook: “The cook is obsessive, controlling and abusive.” The most detailed complaint is from 2015 and appears to have been written or dictated by a resident. It lists more than a dozen issues, including bed bugs, roaches over-medicated residents and fist fights in common areas. “It is a place where you can’t feel safe due to other patients and corrupt staff,” the complaint states. “The staff treat the people there very cruel and show no respect for them or their needs.” Dennis Etzkorn, the owner of Gabriel House, has said he will not speak to journalists and is focused on helping families of the victims and cooperating with the investigation into the fire. Most recently, documents show that state officials were alarmed about the ongoing elevator issues as of spring 2025. A field supervisor with Massachusetts’s long-term care ombudsman made a plea in February to the state to investigate Gabriel House’s faulty elevator, saying that every time he made a call about the problem he was met with “excuses.” “Please call this place and see if this is true … if so we need a remedy /plan asap,” an unnamed official wrote to the office’s assisted living certification specialist. Etzkorn later wrote to the office detailing the timeline of the elevator problems that said work would begin in March after it was first alerted in September 2024. Before the July 13 fire, the most recent compliance review found numerous repeat violations, many related to record keeping. After the facility submitted a corrective plan, the state renewed its certification in December 2023. Investigators said last week that the fire started unintentionally by either someone smoking or an electrical issue with an oxygen machine. The blaze left some residents of the three-story building hanging out of windows and screaming for help. ____ Associated Press Writer Kimberlee Kruesi in Providence, Rhode Island, contributed to this report.

"Big 3 Telecom Wars: 2 Solid Showings, 1 Huge Winner in Q2",https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/big-3-telecom-wars-2-solid-showings-1-huge-winner-in-q2/,"AT&T NYSE: T, Verizon Communications NYSE: VZ, and T-Mobile US NASDAQ: TMUS dominate the telecommunications industry in the United States. Together, investors know them as the “Big Three” telecom stocks. They compete fiercely to win wireless cell phone customers. This competition extends to providing internet to homes and businesses, often referred to as broadband. So, which big name impressed the most in Q2? Let’s break it down. AT&T reported Q2 financials on July 23. At a high level, the results were positive. The company beat sales estimates by more than $400 million and surpassed adjusted earnings per share (EPS) forecasts by 1 cent. Shares closed up by a little more than 1%, underscoring the firm’s solid results. Diving in further, the company added 401,000 net postpaid cell phone subscribers. Despite a 4% drop in additions compared to the same period last year, the figure was significantly better than anticipated. The company’s broadband business also performed well. AT&T added around 243,000 fiber optic customers and around 203,000 AT&T Internet Air customers, and fiber revenues grew by just under 19%. The company’s “converged customers” percentage also ticked up to just under 41% compared to just over 40% last quarter. This metric measures the percentage of fiber and cell phone customers. The increasing percentage indicates that the firm is continuing to progress in cross-selling these services, a highly positive sign. Overall, it was a very solid report for AT&T. The cherry on top was the fact that the firm expects to see $6.5 billion to $8 billion in cash tax savings through 2027 due to the One Big, Beautiful Bill (OBBB). For Q2, Verizon posted results on July 21, beating expectations on both revenue and adjusted EPS. It also slightly increased its full-year guidance on multiple key metrics, including adjusted EPS growth and free cash flow. The free cash flow boost comes as the company sees tax reforms in the OBBB benefiting the metric by $1.5 billion to $2 billion in 2025. These solid headline results led to shares closing up 4% on July 21. However, there was a significant negative in the report. The company’s net postpaid cell phone customers fell by 9,000, while Wall Street expected the figure to rise. This came as the firm added 42,000 business phone customers but lost 51,000 consumer customers. However, the 50,000 net prepaid cell phone additions did soften the blow. The company’s broadband business held strong, adding 293,000 net customers, although this was down from 391,000 a year ago. Overall, Verizon also had a solid quarter, but its loss of postpaid wireless customers is not a great forward-looking signal. Last up is T-Mobile, which reported Q2 results on July 23. The company slightly beat estimates on sales growth, but its adjusted EPS beat was particularly impressive. The figure increased by 14% to $2.84. Wall Street only anticipated a rise of 8%. The firm also boosted guidance. It expects to add around 500,000 more net postpaid customers when combining wireless and broadband, versus previous forecasts. These headline figures led to shares rising more than 6% on July 24. The company also added 830,000 net postpaid cell phone customers, a record Q2 figure for T-Mobile. It also posted 1.7 million total net postpaid adds, another Q2 record. This figure includes net postpaid cell phone adds, net 5G broadband adds, and net postpaid wireless adds for other devices like tablets and wearables. 5G broadband adds were industry-leading, coming in at 545,000. The company also noted that its revenue per account (ARPA) increased by 5%, its highest clip in eight years. The company expects $1.5 billion in OBBB-related cash tax benefits in 2026. For T-Mobile, Q2 2025 was an unmitigated win. Overall, all three of the United States' telecom giants performed solidly in Q2, each beating expectations on headline metrics. However, T-Mobile clearly walked away with the best showing. It massively surpassed adjusted EPS estimates and notched multiple personal bests. After the results came out, analysts at Morgan Stanley NYSE: MS boosted their price target on T-Mobile from $265 to $285. This figure implies 17% upside in shares versus the stock’s July 25 closing price. Before you consider T-Mobile US, you'll want to hear this.

Starbucks looks to protein drinks and other new products to turn around lagging US sales,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/starbucks-looks-to-protein-drinks-and-other-new-products-to-turn-around-lagging-us-sales-next-year-2025-07-29/,"Starbucks said Tuesday it’s confident that improved store operations and new products — including a cold foam protein drink — will soon help turn around the company’s lagging U.S. sales. In the meantime, slow U.S. demand continues to be a drag on the company’s results. Starbucks reported that its revenue rose 4% to $9.5 billion in its fiscal third quarter. That was better than the $9.3 billion Wall Street expected, according to analysts polled by FactSet. But same-store sales, or sales at locations open at least a year, fell 2% in the April-June period. That was a bigger decline than Wall Street expected, and it was the sixth straight quarter that the Seattle-based company reported lower same-store sales. Same-store sales were up in China, Starbucks’ second-largest market. Starbucks has been looking for a partner that can help it expand in China, particularly in smaller cities. Chairman and CEO Brian Niccol said Starbucks was evaluating around 20 offers. “We remain committed to our China business and want to retain a meaningful stake,” Niccol told investors during a conference call on Tuesday. “The intense interest in partnering with us is a testament to the great team, strong brand and long-term opportunity for Starbucks in China. It really is a vote of confidence.” But even as its sales picked up in China, Starbucks' same-store sales in the U.S. fell 2% in in the April-June period. U.S. customers spent more per order, but transactions fell 4%, the company reported. Niccol expressed optimism about a new program setting hospitality standards and staffing levels to better handle peak hours. The “Green Apron Service” model showed so much promise in an eight-week test at 1,500 stores that Starbucks plans to roll it out across the U.S. starting in mid-August, the company said. New software is also helping stores sequence orders, cutting down on wait times. Niccol said 80% of in-store orders are now made in four minutes or less, a target he set last fall. “I think we’ll become famous for Green Apron Service and be the defining customer service company that I think Starbucks should be,” Niccol said. Niccol said improving store operations and paring back Starbucks' menu was necessary before layering in new products. In addition to protein drinks, Starbucks plans to introduce new baked goods and a new dark roast coffee next year. It will also test beverages made with coconut water, customizable energy drinks, and gluten-free and high-protein foods. Niccol said Starbucks has been working closely with employees to develop new food and drink items that can be prepared quickly and consistently. In the past, he said, the company would often develop new menu items at its headquarters and then hope baristas figured out how to make them. “Those days are over,” Niccol said. Niccol said Starbucks is also trying to encourage customers to linger in its stores. It's closing or modifying some of its approximately 90 mobile order-only storefronts and it is developing a store prototype with 32 seats and a drive-thru window that costs 30% less than the company's current store design. Starbucks is spending heavily to turn itself around. One big expense in the third quarter was a two-day meeting in Las Vegas where the company hosted 14,000 store managers and regional leaders. The company said its net income fell 47% to $558 million in the April-June period. Adjusted for one-time items, its earnings fell 46% to 50 cents per share for the quarter. That was lower than the 65 cents analysts had forecast. Starbucks shares rose 3% in after-hours trading. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

Analysts Are Upgrading These 3 Massive AI Stocks After Earnings,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/analysts-are-upgrading-these-3-massive-ai-stocks-after-earnings/,"As Q2 earnings season rolls on, some of the world’s most influential tech and infrastructure companies have delivered strong results—but what’s catching Wall Street’s attention isn’t just the numbers, it’s the upgraded outlooks and rising price targets. In particular, three stocks—each deeply involved in the growth of artificial intelligence—have seen analysts sharply raise their expectations. While all three are in or nearing mega-cap territory (market caps of $200 billion or more), their post-earnings share performance hasn’t fully reflected the bullish sentiment now taking shape. Here’s a closer look at the names that are drawing analyst upgrades and why the market may be underpricing them. First up is Magnificent Seven stock and Google parent company Alphabet NASDAQ: GOOGL. The firm boasts a market capitalization of over $2.3 trillion, and consumers and investors alike recognize it for its Gemini large language model. Alphabet reported earnings on July 23, and the company solidly beat estimates on both sales and adjusted earnings per share (EPS). Despite posting strong results, shares didn’t do too much afterward, closing up just 1% over the next trading session. However, Wall Street analysts indicated that the results may have warranted a much more bullish move up. MarketBeat tracked nearly 20 analysts who boosted their Google price targets on July 24. This is because the average price target among these analysts has increased by 6.7%. Because this number is much higher than the stock's actual rise, untapped opportunities could exist for investors in this name. The MarketBeat consensus price target on Alphabet is around $211, implying around 9% upside in shares. However, the average price target among those analysts who updated their forecasts on July 24 is $215, implying more than 11% upside. Wall Street analysts are moderately more bullish on the stock now than they were before the release. Notably, Google still trades at the lowest forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of any Magnificent Seven stock at just under 20x. Next up is GE Vernova NYSE: GEV, a company that is really helping power the AI revolution. With a market cap of around $175 million, GE Vernova is quickly approaching mega-cap territory. The company had an absolute blowout quarter in Q2, crushing estimates and boosting guidance. Orders for its natural gas-powered turbines are spiking as utility companies work to keep up with booming electricity demand, primarily due to AI data centers. After reporting results on July 23, shares spiked nearly 15% that day. Then, on July 24, MarketBeat tracked just under 10 Wall Street analysts who boosted their price target on the stock. Overall, the average price target among these analysts increased by a whopping 27%. The MarketBeat consensus price target on GE Vernova stock is $541, implying around 16% share downside. However, honing in on price targets updated on July 24 completely flips the script. Among those targets, the average is nearly $698. That figure implies an 8% upside in shares. This comes as GE Vernova shares have already provided a total return of more than 96% in 2025. Last up is agentic AI player ServiceNow NYSE: NOW. As of the July 25 close, ServiceNow trades at a market capitalization of $201 billion, barely a mega-cap stock. Reporting Q2 results on July 23, ServiceNow moderately beat expectations on sales but surpassed adjusted EPS estimates by a wide margin. This resulted in shares seeing a solid 4% rise afterward. MarketBeat tracked nearly 10 analysts who raised their price targets on the stock. However, a couple of them slightly lowered or reiterated their targets. Overall, the average price target among these analysts increased by a little less than 6%, not too far off from the stock’s actual gain. Still, analysts continue to see upside in shares. The MarketBeat consensus price target on ServiceNow is around $1,115, implying 15% upside in shares. That number rises even further when only considering targets updated on July 24. Among them, the average target is around $1,176, implying a 22% share upside. Taken together, Alphabet, GE Vernova, and ServiceNow are not only delivering solid quarterly results—they’re earning renewed confidence from Wall Street. The sharp uptick in analyst price targets, particularly in cases where share prices haven’t yet responded in kind, points to underappreciated upside potential. These names could represent meaningful opportunities in the quarters ahead for investors tracking the intersection of mega-cap growth and AI-driven innovation.

Microsoft Authenticator is ending password autofill soon. How to set up a passkey before Aug. 1,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/microsoft-authenticator-is-ending-password-autofill-soon-how-to-set-up-a-passkey-before-aug-1-2025-07-29/,"NEW YORK (AP) — If you're a Microsoft Authenticator user, like me, you’ve probably received at least one notice that the app's password management features are no longer usable and that your stored passwords will be inaccessible starting Aug. 1 unless you have the Edge browser. Why? Because Microsoft is moving its signature sign-in app to a digital authentication method touted by security experts as an easier and more secure way to log in: passkeys. “Last year (2024), we observed a staggering 7,000 password attacks per second (more than double the rate from 2023),"" Microsoft wrote in a blog post. ""Although passwords have been around for centuries, we hope their reign over our online world is ending.” Authenticator has been a staple in providing multi-factor authentication, one-time passwords and biometric logins for services and some websites. Although the app will continue to provide authentication for passkey-compatible services, it is pushing its password management and autofill functions out to the company's Edge browser instead. Note that not all websites and applications have adopted passkeys yet, so many places still rely on passwords. If you haven't yet moved to a different password manager system or set up your passkeys, we're here to help. Passkeys do away with complex 14 character passwords because you never need to see them. Instead you are using existing biometrics like your face or fingerprints, digital patterns or PINs to access your accounts. Passkeys are made up of two parts of a code that only makes sense when they’re combined, kind of like a digital key and padlock. You keep half of the encrypted code, typically stored either in the cloud with a compatible verification app — including Authenticator — or on a physical security dongle. The other half is stored on the participating apps, services or accounts you want to access. The bad news? You do have to set up individual passkeys for each service or application that accepts them. Keeping track of where you can use them versus traditional passwords can be challenging. If you've opened Authenticator in the last few months, you likely were prompted to set up a passkey through a guided experience. If you didn't receive such a prompt, you can set up a new passkey by opening the authenticator app on your device. Find and tap on your account, then select “set up a passkey” option. Follow the app's instructions. The good news is that all of your old passwords are synced to your Microsoft account. But to access them after Aug. 1, you will need to first install the Edge browser on your device of choice (and log into it). For iOS users, navigate to Settings General Autofill & Passwords and turn on Edge. Android users click their way to Settings General management Passwords and autofill Autofill service and select Edge. Laptop and desktop users will need to open Edge and navigate to Settings Profiles Passwords. There you should find an autofill toggle and another option to save new passwords to your account. Firstly, check out our advice on selecting and using password managers. There are many services — paid and free — out there and options to consider. Now to export your Authenticator passwords, open the app on your device then navigate to Settings Export Passwords. This will spit out an exported file containing your data. Most of the password managers out there — including those built into other browsers, or Apple and Android's own key ring apps — will have an import option, which should accept this file. If you're having difficulty with the import, it's best to consult their customer service lines for help. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

A Turkish Airlines flight is evacuated via emergency slides after smoke detected in landing gear,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/a-turkish-airlines-flight-is-evacuated-via-emergency-slides-after-smoke-detected-in-landing-gear-2025-07-29/,"ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — A Turkish Airlines flight was evacuated via emergency slides shortly after landing Tuesday at a coastal resort in southern Turkey because of smoke in the landing gear, officials said. There were no injuries. Smoke appeared while the Boeing 777 from Istanbul was taxiing on the runway at the airport in the city of Antalya. Emergency response teams recommended the evacuation as a precautionary measure to ensure passenger safety, airline spokesperson Yahya Ustun said on X. All passengers were “promptly” evacuated, Ustun added. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment and it was not clear how many passengers and crew were on board. An initial inspection of the aircraft indicated that the smoke originated from a hydraulic pipe malfunction, Ustun said. Technical inspections of the aircraft were underway.

Act Fast: These 3 Undervalued Stocks Won’t Stay Low for Long,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/act-fast-these-3-undervalued-stocks-wont-stay-low-for-long/,"With new all-time high valuations for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 in full swing, more and more investors are growing wary of buying new names for their portfolios, and for good reason. Buying near the top of the valuation cycle is always a scary thing. Still, several names haven’t caught up to this optimism today, providing some of the most attractive discounts in the market. This is where being a shrewd investor comes in handy; instead of focusing on the hyped-up names in the stock market, it's better to concentrate on the best fundamentals that trade at a discount. With this in mind, discounts can be interchangeable between price action and traditional valuation multiples, as long as investors can rectify the underlying story for higher prices. Chances are, portfolios that carry discounted names like XPeng Inc. NYSE: XPEV, Intel Co. NASDAQ: INTC, and even Albemarle Corp. NYSE: ALB will see their equity curves enjoy a path that goes up and to the right. Although this ride may not be the smoothest, it is likely to outperform the curve of others who buy the hyped names trading at all-time highs today. Most investors are afraid of putting their money to work overseas, most of all in Chinese stocks. However, there are a few reasons to believe that China’s stock market could outperform the S&P 500 over the next few years, as valuation gaps directly contradict the earnings per share (EPS) growth that the two countries are set to deliver. This is where XPeng stock becomes attractive, trading at only 70% of its 52-week high. However, it is one of China’s leading suppliers in the automotive sector. Most electric vehicles (EVs) in China, which is where most of the EV growth is happening, look to XPeng for parts and other services, making it a hot name to consider today. More than being an industry leader in one of the fastest-growing economies and markets, today’s price does not reflect where future EPS could be for XPeng at all. According to Wall Street analysts, this company could report up to $0.30 in EPS over the next 12 months, a massive jump from today’s net loss of $0.10. This outlook might explain why Morgan Stanley analyst Tim Hsaio decided to reiterate his Overweight rating on XPeng stock, this time also boosting its fair valuation target to $28 per share. Now, investors are talking about a potential rally of as much as 47% from where the stock trades today. Following Intel's new management team's decision to prioritize cost control over growth, the market punished the stock with a 9% selloff in the last week of July 2025. However, cutting costs is precisely what some institutions wanted to see out of Intel. With President Trump announcing America’s A.I. Action Plan, it is clearer than it has ever been that capital will now rotate to chipmakers that have a significant footprint in manufacturing within the United States. This is where Intel lands way ahead of everyone else in the peer group, since it has been building out factories in Ohio and Arizona since 2022. By the time Intel’s competitors reach this level of manufacturing exposure, markets are likely to realize that the investment and political advantages are greater when investing in the early leader, which is Intel. As the stock trades at only 66% of its 52-week high, it has recently become a prime candidate for big buyers. Buyers such as the Aberdeen Group boosted their holdings in Intel stock by 8.4% as of late July 2025, bringing their entire position to a high of $90.9 million to make them one of Intel’s largest institutional holders. This gives every other investor a new vote of confidence in this company’s upside. This lithium and rare earth metals player is going to be one of the hottest stocks in the coming years. As the United States prepares to negotiate further with China and Europe regarding rare earth metals used in energy production and storage, Albemarle could become the next big jump for the basic materials sector. Seeing that the future is brighter for the bulls, and now that the stock trades at only 64% of its 52-week high, some of the short sellers in this name decided to leave their convictions in the dust. That’s where investors can notice a decline of up to 7.4% in Albemarle’s short interest over the past month alone. Not to mention, there is also a renewed level of institutional buying interest. As of mid-July 2025, PGGM Investments has decided to build up a new stake worth $67.1 million, and, similar to Intel, this position makes PGGM the largest institutional holder. The fact that they are one of the most recent ones also plays into the optimistic timing for this company. Before you consider XPeng, you'll want to hear this.

Top 220 Most Beloved Local Businesses Across the U.S. [2025 Survey],https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/top-220-most-beloved-local-businesses-across-the-us-2025-survey/,"We all have “that place” in our town - the bakery that still wraps things in wax paper, the bookshop that smells like dust and vanilla, the barbecue joint that hasn’t changed since your grandpa’s prom. But when we asked 3,004 Americans to name their favorite classic, locally owned business, some surprising patterns emerged. Here are the full rankings: The below ranking shows the top 220 small businesses across America that locals love the most. Methodology: Online panel survey of 3,004 respondents based on age, gender, and geography. Internal data sources are used to obtain population data sets. We used a two-step process to ensure representativeness through stratified sampling and post-stratification weighting. August 2025. Copy the code below and paste it into the body of the HTML of your web page. The state landed not one, not two, but four spots in the top 200, including Big Bob Gibson Bar-B-Q, which clinched the #1 position overall. Clearly, there’s something sacred about sauce down south. Despite its small population, Hawaii placed three businesses in the top 25 - from the misty artist haven of Volcano Garden Arts (#2) to the homey noodles at Hamura Saimin Stand in Lihue. Touristy, yes - but this list proves it still has deep local soul. Two Sisters Bakery (#6) and the Salty Dawg Saloon (#20), both in Homer, placed highly. It’s rare for two top picks to hail from the same small town - but cinnamon rolls and sea shanties seem to be a winning combo. In a city known for constant reinvention, Gambler’s General Store (#3) is a nostalgic anchor. People may come to Vegas for the lights, but they stay (or at least shop) for the dice. Polly’s Pancake Parlor in Sugar Hill, NH, ranked #8, and several other top scorers - including Blue Bonnet Café (TX) and The Blue & White Restaurant (MS) - revolve around breakfast. Turns out, people are loyal to their flapjacks. BBQ joints showed up across the map - from Parker’s Barbecue in North Carolina (#9) to Jones Bar-B-Q Diner in Arkansas and Louie Mueller Barbecue in Texas. Even in a divided country, we agree on smoked meat. While big cities like New York and L.A. made the list (Tom’s Restaurant in Brooklyn at #12, and Larchmont Village Cheese & Wine in LA at #15), the top 10 is largely rural. Nostalgia thrives where neon hasn’t taken over. Several states had multiple cities in the top 20 — Nevada (Vegas and Ely), Hawaii (Volcano and Honolulu), Alaska (Homer twice), and Alabama (Decatur and Scottsboro). Seems local pride isn’t limited to capital cities. Some of the most loved spots combine functions — Cops & Doughnuts is both a precinct and a pastry shop. Dog Ears Bookstore in Buffalo is also a café. And Economy Drug in Ely doubles as an old-school soda fountain. The more, the merrier. While not flashy, indie bookshops are everywhere on this list - especially in smaller towns. From The Book Mill in Montague, MA, to Village Lights in Madison, IN, they’re proof that community and curiosity still go hand-in-hand. This list isn’t just about businesses. It’s about belonging. These places anchor our memories - the first root beer float, the Saturday-morning pancake ritual, the novel that changed your summer. They're part of the emotional architecture of hometown life. And while they may not have apps, algorithms, or sleek branding, what they do have is harder to replicate: heart. Online panel survey of 3,004 respondents based on age, gender, and geography. Internal data sources are used to obtain population data sets. We used a two-step process to ensure representativeness through stratified sampling and post-stratification weighting. Respondents are carefully chosen from a geographically representative online panel of double opt-in members.

Nantucket officials accuse offshore wind developer of going into hiding since Trump's election,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/nantucket-officials-accuse-offshore-wind-developer-of-going-into-hiding-since-trumps-election-2025-07-29/,"BOSTON (AP) — Officials in Massachusetts' Nantucket island on Tuesday accused the developer of the nation's first utility-scale offshore wind project of not responding to their safety queries since Donald Trump's election after a massive wind turbine broke apart last year and its fragments washed up on beaches. Nantucket’s select board gave Vineyard Wind two weeks to respond to a list of demands, including that it follow deadline requirements for notifying local officials of emergencies. Violations could result in fines up to $250,000, the town said, although it was unclear how such a policy would be enforced. Board member Brooke Mohr suggested the Trump administration's skepticism toward offshore wind projects is to blame for what Mohr said was Vineyard Wind's lack of communication. The town said Vineyard Wind, which is owned by Denmark-based Avangrid Renewables and Copenhagen Infrastructure in partnership with Spain-based Iberdrola, has failed to respond to private requests for changes to its protocols. Litigation may be a next step if the town’s demands are unmet, officials said. “We believe that they are concerned about the change in policy at the federal level and drawing scrutiny from the new administration, which has ordered a review of offshore wind permitting practices,” Mohr said during a virtual briefing with news reporters. “However, hiding is not the solution to their problems, nor is it the solution to our problems.” Vineyard Wind did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by The Associated Press. The project about 14 miles (23 kilometers) off nearby Martha's Vineyard was approved by President Joe Biden's administration in May 2021, a key step in Biden's plans to increase U.S. reliance on offshore wind by 2030. Fiberglas fragments of a massive wind turbine blade that broke apart off Nantucket began washing ashore last summer during the peak of tourist season after pieces of the blade at the Vineyard Wind project began falling into the Atlantic Ocean in July. GE Vernova, which agreed to pay $10.5 million in a settlement earlier this month to compensate island businesses that suffered losses as a result of the blade failure, blamed a manufacturing problem at one of its factories in Canada and said there was no indication of a design flaw. It reinspected all blades made at the factory and removed other blades made there from the Vineyard Wind location. In the final days of the Biden administration, federal regulators lifted a suspension order on the project, pending the removal of all installed blades manufactured by GE Vernova. On Tuesday, town officials accused Vineyard Wind of violating a contract made with Nantucket five years ago that requires the company to communicate regularly with the town at all stages of project development and deployment. It also said Vineyard Wind hasn't done enough to reduce light pollution or engage the town with its emergency response plans following the blade failure. Nantucket officials refused to include Vineyard Wind as a signatory in the $10.5 million settlement, citing the company’s “lack of leadership, transparency, and stewardship” following the blade failure.

Why value investing has worked better outside the US,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/why-value-investing-has-worked-better-outside-the-us-2025-07-29/,"I recently interviewed investor and author Daniel Rasmussen for The Long View podcast, where he commented that “value hasn’t worked in the U.S., but it’s worked fine internationally.” I was intrigued by this observation. So, I looked at Morningstar‘s indexes. Sure enough, value investing has prospered beyond American shores—this year, as well as over the past three-, five-, and 10-year periods. US stocks of all styles have beaten international stocks for years, due to a strengthening dollar, superior returns on invested capital, and expanding price multiples. Morningstar‘s US growth index is dominated by the “ Magnificent Seven.” But internationally, the scale is far smaller. There is not a single public company outside the US currently worth $1 trillion. There was a time when the “ Granolas ” stocks were being promoted as Europe’s answer to the Magnificent Seven (names like GSK, Roche, Nestle, L’Oreal and AstraZeneca). But don’t blame yourself if you haven’t heard of the Granolas. They never really rivaled the Magnificent Seven from a performance perspective. So, what has boosted value investing internationally? Largely, the financial-services sector (which was lifted by higher interest rates) and energy stocks. While value has outperformed growth in Europe over the past five years, Europe now represents less than half of equity market capitalization outside the US. Rather, value stocks in emerging markets (like China, India, and Brazil) and developed Asia have outperformed by an even larger margin than in Europe. The decline of Chinese internet companies, which were once big growth stocks, helps explain why value investing has triumphed over growth investing in emerging markets in recent years. On the developed-markets side, Japan has seen rising interest rates and improved economic and investment conditions disproportionately benefit financial-services stocks, which tend to reside on the value side of the market. While I have mentioned some macroeconomic factors above, I am generally skeptical of attempts to explain style leadership from the top down. Back in 2022, when sticky inflation prompted the largest interest-rate hikes in a generation, US growth stocks fell much further than value. A popular narrative arose: Growth stocks are more sensitive to interest rates. But then growth bounced back in 2023 despite high rates. The Magnificent Seven and others rode a wave of enthusiasm for AI. Growth stocks’ thriving amid higher rates is hardly unprecedented. Between 2015 and 2018, the US Federal Reserve hiked rates several times, yet growth beat value by a wide margin. Ultimately, I agree with Rasmussen that the triumph of growth over value in the US has more to do with “historically unique and rare circumstances.” I’ve been following markets long enough to know that style leadership can be cyclical. Right now, it’s value investing that’s being fundamentally questioned. Value stocks have been called “structurally challenged,” in “secular decline,” and “value traps.” But the value side of the market has always been home to troubled companies. Value investing is about stocks that under promise and overdeliver. Perhaps the long-term cycle will turn again in value’s favor. AI could be revolutionary, but, like the internet, ahead of itself from an investment perspective. We could look back at 2025 as a historical inflection point, as marking a new market regime. The problem is that these things are only clear in retrospect. It will take time to know if the rotations we’ve seen in early 2025 will last, or if they’re just head fakes. ____ This article was provided to The Associated Press by Morningstar.

Can HCA Healthcare Revive the Market’s Weakest Sector?,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/can-hca-healthcare-revive-the-markets-weakest-sector/,"The healthcare sector has experienced a 0.79% decline year-to-date, making it the worst performer among the S&P 500’s 11 sectors and the only one in negative territory. But unlike other market-lagging sectors that have performed better of late (e.g., consumer discretionary), healthcare isn’t just the worst-performing sector in 2025; it’s the worst-performing sector over the past three months. The dramatic losses experienced by companies like UnitedHealth Group NYSE: UNH, which has lost more than 44% YTD, have been well-publicized. But one company operating in that sector hasn’t only avoided the pain; its 14% gain has outperformed the market. Based on its recent earnings call, Nashville-based HCA Healthcare NYSE: HCA is providing forward guidance that the rest of the industry hopes will be a rising tide that lifts all boats. Over the past several years, healthcare companies’ financials have stagnated or weakened. That’s been felt particularly by the healthcare services vertical. Despite national healthcare expenditures in the United States rising from $3.756 trillion in 2019 to 5.049 trillion in 2024—or 34.42%—EBITDA for the companies operating in the healthcare services space saw a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of just 8.5% over the same period. An 8.5% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) isn’t alarming on its own—but in context, it reflects a shrinking share of overall U.S. healthcare spending. Several short-term headwinds are contributing to this, including persistent inflation, labor shortages, expensive tech infrastructure, and industry consolidation. Encouragingly, most healthcare leaders view these as temporary pressures. In fact, 25% of large healthcare service providers cite the current administration as their top concern, compared to 21% pointing to labor challenges and 19% citing inflation. At the same time, the aforementioned issue of ongoing industry consolidation is concerning, but only to 2% of healthcare service providers with market caps above $2 billion. One large part of that is HCA Healthcare itself, which has acquired six companies in the past five years. HCA Healthcare is the largest healthcare system in the United States, and it didn’t achieve that status by accident. The company, which boasts a market cap of $81.56 billion, is a serial acquirer. When it went public in 1969, it owned and operated 11 hospitals. Since then, its focus has expanded from patient care to provider consolidation. Today, HCA Healthcare owns 222 hospitals and more than 2,000 outpatient sites, including surgery centers, freestanding emergency rooms, urgent care centers, and physician clinics. Those facilities span 21 states and the United Kingdom. It leads the field with 41,194 beds—nearly two-thirds more than the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the second-largest provider with 25,260 beds. Scrutinizing top healthcare services providers’ net patient revenue more easily puts this into perspective. Last year, HCA raked in $55.715 from its patients. Second on that list is Chicago-based CommonSpirit Health, whose $29.482 billion in net patient revenue is more than 47% less than HCA’s. From 2011 to 2024, HCA Healthcare acquired 23 companies, including six in 2017 alone. The company’s ability to scale via M&A while retaining an emphasis on provider services is unparalleled and has resulted in a stellar financial performance. That’s particularly evident when looking at HCA’s free cash flow over the past few years, which has increased 36.63% from $4.127 in 2022 to $5.639 in 2024. When the company reported Q2 results on July 25, they announced EPS of $6.84 versus expectations of $6.20 and revenues of $18.61 billion versus expectations of $18.49 billion—good for gains of 24.4% and 6.4%, respectively, over the year-ago quarter. The end result? The healthcare giant’s sixth consecutive quarterly beat, alongside net income increasing 13.1% to $1.653 billion. Shareholders have every reason to expect HCA to continue bucking the healthcare sector’s lackluster performance in 2025. The company’s trailing annualized EPS stands at $23.79, good for an attractive price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 14.23. Next year, HCA forecasts EPS to grow 12.21% to $28.03. All of that culminates in a consensus Moderate Buy rating. Nine of 18 analysts covering HCA assign it a Buy rating, and nine assign it a Hold. The stock’s average 12-month price target is $396.46, representing 16.56% potential upside from today’s share price. HCA Healthcare pays a modest dividend currently yielding 0.85%, or $2.88 annually per share. But the company has increased its payout for six consecutive years, and its incredibly low dividend payout ratio of 12.11% indicates that HCA is rewarding shareholders while reinvesting capital for future growth.

RCL Stock Sinks After Earnings—Is a Buying Opportunity Ahead?,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/rcl-stock-sinks-after-earningsis-a-buying-opportunity-ahead/,"Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. NYSE: RCL stock is down 5.6% in midday trading after the company’s second-quarter earnings report. The company beat earnings per share (EPS) expectations of $4.04 by 34 cents, coming in at $4.38. That number was also 36% higher year-over-year. However, revenue of $4.54 billion was just a tick under the $4.55 billion expected by analysts. The company’s earnings guidance also spooked investors. Royal Caribbean forecasts EPS between $5.55 and $5.65 per share for the upcoming quarter, which is lower than analysts’ estimates of $5.84. Plus, Royal Caribbean is now estimating full-year EPS between $15.41 and $15.55. While that’s an 86-cent increase on the low end, the midpoint still trails the consensus estimate of $15.46. But with RCL stock up more than 44% in 2025, investors were likely hoping for better numbers. The Royal Caribbean analyst forecasts on MarketBeat gave the stock a consensus price target of $311.05. Even with this pullback, RCL stock is still trading at around a 7% premium to consensus targets. RCL stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of more than 27x. That’s significantly higher than its historical average and above the sector average for consumer discretionary stocks. It’s also about twice as high as that of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. NYSE: NCLH and Carnival Corp. NYSE: CCL. Royal Caribbean bulls may point out that the stock’s P/E ratio is better than that of Viking Holdings Inc. NYSE: VIK, which has shown similar growth to Royal Caribbean. However, VIK stock has only been publicly traded since 2024. The company has shown solid growth, but its market capitalization is about one-third of Royal Caribbean’s. Also, while short interest is only about 5% of the overall float, it’s spiked over 20% in the last month, making the drop in RCL stock predictable. Perspective matters, and it might explain why RCL stock narrowed its losses by over 3% after the market opened. The company was disappointed with its earnings guidance, which could partly be due to Royal Caribbean’s plans to reduce debt. Cruise lines are capital-intensive businesses. High leverage is common due to the cost of ships and infrastructure. However, Royal Caribbean’s debt-to-equity ratio of 2.21 is lower than that of its peers. Plus, in the last quarter, the company repaid $1.4 billion in debt and plans to pay $3.3 billion for the full year. In the short term, that would come at the expense of earnings. But over a longer period, that’s bullish for the stock, particularly if interest rates begin to come down later this year. This is to say that RCL stock may have further to fall. However, that could present investors on the sidelines with a more attractive entry point. The stock has dipped below its 50-day simple moving average (SMA). That’s the first time this month that RCL stock has moved sharply against its trendline. The intraday recovery shows some buying interest, but the gap indicates a strong negative market reaction, likely driven by institutional buyers. Bearish momentum is confirmed by the MACD, which shows a sharp crossover below the signal line.. However, with an RSI in the upper 30s, there could be a reason to believe the sell-off is overdone. After a sharp sell-off, the stock bounced off a low of around $325. In the short term, investors will want to see if the stock can sustain a price between $340 and $350, which could be a potential area of resistance.

Amazon's Pre-Earnings Setup Is Almost Too Clean—Red Flag?,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/amazons-pre-earnings-setup-is-almost-too-cleanred-flag/,"Having closed out Monday's session just under $233, shares of tech giant Amazon.com Inc. NASDAQ: AMZN are now trading within just $10 of their all-time high from last February. The 45% rally since April has been nothing short of extraordinary, a clean, uninterrupted move upward with higher highs and higher lows dominating the chart. But with Amazon's much-anticipated Q2 earnings due on Thursday, investors now need to ask themselves: has the rally been too perfect? Is sentiment running too hot? Could a strong but not exceptional report trigger a pullback? Let's jump in and take a closer look. Let's start with what's undeniable. The chart, since April, is immaculate. Since bottoming out at the start of that month, Amazon has barely looked back. Momentum has stayed strong, with effectively no major pullbacks, and the bulls have aggressively defended and bought into every dip. The stock's relative strength index (RSI) is 68, warm, but far from overbought. Technically, the setup remains undoubtedly bullish. Add to that the unrelenting analyst support. Already this week, the likes of UBS and Morgan Stanley reiterated their Buy and Overweight ratings, respectively, with their boosted price targets now ranging as high as $271. If Amazon were to hit this in the coming weeks and months, it'd be well above February's all-time high and far into blue sky territory. Crucially, Amazon's fundamentals continue to offer support. Consensus estimates for Thursday's report call for a 9.4% year-over-year (YOY) increase in revenue, with earnings per share growth expected to be closer to 3.6% YOY. Unsurprisingly, the company's AWS unit is expected to contribute quite a bit, with many on Wall Street forecasting its revenue will accelerate into the year's second half and beyond. However, here's the counter-argument: when a stock rallies this hard for this long, it sets a very high bar. And even though analysts are calling for the rally to continue, Amazon may need to deliver more than just strong numbers to justify the recent move. Keep in mind that the stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is now at 38, a little frothier compared to last quarter and certainly richer when stacked against peers like Alphabet Inc NASDAQ: GOOGL, which has a P/E ratio closer to 20. That kind of valuation demands clear margin expansion, accelerating revenue growth, and/or a blowout AI narrative. Anything less could easily disappoint investors and send them rushing to take profits. Some cracks are already being watched; the forecasted 3.6% growth in EPS feels a tad underwhelming. The company's free cash flow has also been declining in recent quarters, and further signs of this trend could be a red flag for long-term investors concerned about capital allocation in the face of surging AI infrastructure costs and geopolitical risks. If you're already long, there's a strong case for holding through earnings. As noted above, the trend is intact, the analyst community is behind the stock, and Amazon is showing signs of firing on all cylinders. But if you're looking to initiate a new position, some caution might be warranted; just one soft datapoint or conservative comment could knock the stock back. And here's the rub: because Amazon's rally has had few to no pullbacks, there's no clear line of support unless you go back to around the $200 mark, and that's dangerous. However, Amazon remains one of the most dominant businesses in the world, and this week's earnings will be an opportunity to prove that once again. Even if there is a post-earnings pullback, remember, corrections are a healthy and necessary part of a longer-term uptrend, and that's ultimately how investors and Wall Street alike are looking at Amazon today.

US health officials crack down on kratom-related products after complaints from supplement industry,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/us-health-officials-crack-down-on-kratom-related-products-after-complaints-from-supplement-industry-2025-07-29/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. health officials are warning Americans about the risks of an opioid-related ingredient increasingly added to energy drinks, gummies and supplements sold at gas stations and convenience stores, recommending a nationwide ban. The chemical, known as 7- hydroxymitragynine, is a component of kratom, a plant native to Southeast Asia that has gained popularity in the U.S. as an unapproved treatment for pain, anxiety and drug dependence. In recent months, dietary supplement companies that sell kratom have been urging the Food and Drug Administration to crack down on the products containing 7-OH, portraying it as a dangerously concentrated, synthetic form of the original ingredient. The FDA action “is not focused on natural kratom leaf products,"" according to a statement Tuesday by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The agency said it was releasing a report to educate about the risks of “7-OH and its distinction from the kratom plant leaf.” Regulators are also recommending that the ingredient be placed on the federal government's most restrictive list of illegal drugs, which includes LSD and heroin. “7-OH is an opioid that can be more potent than morphine,"" said FDA Commissioner Marty Makary. ""We need regulation and public education to prevent another wave of the opioid epidemic.” The agency’s recommendation will be reviewed by the Drug Enforcement Administration, which sets federal rules for high-risk drugs including prescription medicines and illicit substances. A national ban wouldn’t take effect until the agency drafts and finalizes new rules governing the ingredient. Federal regulators have been scrutinizing kratom for about a decade after reports of addiction, injury and overdose. But users and distributors have long opposed efforts to regulate it, saying kratom could be a safer alternative to opioid painkillers that sparked the ongoing drug addiction epidemic. Last month, the FDA issued warning letters to seven companies selling drinks, gummies and powders infused with 7-OH. Regulators said the products violated FDA rules because they have not been evaluated for safety and, in some cases, claimed to treat medical conditions, including pain, arthritis and anxiety. Supplement executives quickly applauded the move. The FDA ""demonstrated the exact kind of data-driven, proactive regulatory excellence needed to safeguard unwitting consumers across the U.S.,” said Ryan Niddel of Diversified Botanics, a Utah-based company that sells kratom supplements. An industry group, the American Kratom Association, has lobbied Congress for years against restrictions on the plant. Legislation supported by the group would prohibit the FDA from regulating kratom more strictly than food and dietary supplements. On Tuesday, a rival group that supports the availability of 7-OH drugs criticized the government's move, pointing to the influence of kratom suppliers. “Big kratom trade groups have spent years blaming 7-OH for harms caused by their own unregulated products, because it threatens their market share,” the Holistic Alternative Recovery Trust stated in an emailed message. Nearly a decade ago, the federal government came close to banning kratom. In 2016, the DEA announced plans to add it to the government’s most restrictive schedule 1, reserved for drugs that have no medical use and a high potential for abuse. But the plan stalled after a flood of public complaints, including a letter signed by more than 60 members of Congress. The FDA then began studying the ingredient, concluding in 2018 that kratom contains many of the same chemicals as opioids, the addictive class of drugs that includes painkillers like OxyContin as well as heroin and fentanyl. Since then, FDA regulators have continued to issue warnings about cases of injury, addiction and death with kratom supplements, which are usually sold in capsules or powders. In recent months, the FDA has also issued warnings on other unapproved drugs sold as supplements or energy drinks, including the antidepressant tianeptine. Sometimes referred to collectively as “gas station heroin,” the drugs have been restricted by several states, but they are not scheduled at the federal level. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Trump EPA moves to repeal landmark 'endangerment finding' that allows climate regulation,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-epa-moves-to-repeal-landmark-finding-that-allows-climate-regulation-2025-07-29/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's administration on Tuesday proposed revoking a scientific finding that has long been the central basis for U.S. action to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and fight climate change. The proposed Environmental Protection Agency rule would rescind a 2009 declaration that determined that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. The “endangerment finding” is the legal underpinning of a host of climate regulations under the Clean Air Act for motor vehicles, power plants and other pollution sources that are heating the planet. Repealing the finding “will be the largest deregulatory action in the history of America,"" EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said Tuesday. “There are people who, in the name of climate change, are willing to bankrupt the country,"" Zeldin said on the conservative “Ruthless” podcast. ""They created this endangerment finding and then they are able to put all these regulations on vehicles, on airplanes, on stationary sources, to basically regulate out of existence, in many cases, a lot of segments of our economy. And it cost Americans a lot of money.” The EPA proposal must go though a lengthy review process, including public comment, before it is finalized, likely next year. Environmental groups are likely to challenge the rule change in court. Zeldin called for a rewrite of the endangerment finding in March as part of a series of environmental rollbacks announced at the same time in what he said was ""the greatest day of deregulation in American history.'' A total of 31 key environmental rules on topics from clean air to clean water and climate change would be rolled back or repealed under Zeldin's plan. Under the Obama and Biden administrations, his predecessors at EPA “twisted the law, ignored precedent and warped science to achieve their preferred ends and stick American families with hundreds of billions of dollars in hidden taxes every single year,'' Zeldin said Tuesday at an event in Indiana announcing the proposed rule change. The EPA also called for rescinding limits on tailpipe emissions that were designed to encourage automakers to build and sell more electric vehicles, a rule Trump incorrectly labels an EV “mandate.” The transportation sector is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. Environmental groups said Zeldin's action seeks to deny reality even as weather disasters exacerbated by climate change grow worse in the U.S. and around the world. “As Americans reel from deadly floods and heat waves, the Trump administration is trying to argue that the emissions turbocharging these disasters are not a threat,'' said Christy Goldfuss, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council. “It boggles the mind and endangers the nation’s safety and welfare.” Under Zeldin and Trump, “the EPA wants to shirk its responsibility to protect us from climate pollution, but science and the law say otherwise,'' she added. “If EPA finalizes this illegal and cynical approach, we will see them in court.” Three former EPA leaders have also criticized Zeldin, saying his March announcement targeting the endangerment finding and other rules imperiled the lives of millions of Americans and abandoned the agency’s dual mission to protect the environment and human health. “If there’s an endangerment finding to be found anywhere, it should be found on this administration because what they’re doing is so contrary to what the Environmental Protection Agency is about,” Christine Todd Whitman, who led EPA under Republican President George W. Bush, said after Zeldin's plan was made public. The EPA proposal follows an executive order from Trump that directed the agency to submit a report “on the legality and continuing applicability” of the endangerment finding. Conservatives and some congressional Republicans hailed the plan, calling it a way to undo economically damaging rules to regulate greenhouse gases. But environmental groups, legal experts and Democrats said any attempt to repeal or roll back the endangerment finding would be an uphill task with slim chance of success. The Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that EPA has authority to regulate greenhouse gases as air pollutants under the Clean Air Act. The EPA proposal “seeks to deny settled science by creating legal distinctions that have no basis in the law,” said Abigail Dillen, president of the environmental law firm Earthjustice. Rather than take seriously its responsibility to protect public health, “the Trump administration is pretending that the pollution causing climate change is not hurting us, even as we suffer more devastating climate disasters every year,"" she said. If finalized, repeal of the endangerment finding would erase current limits on greenhouse gas pollution from cars, factories, power plants and other sources and could prevent future administrations from proposing rules to tackle climate change. “The endangerment finding is built on a rock-solid scientific foundation that has gotten even stronger over time,"" said Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund. The finding “has supported commonsense solutions that reduce pollution, give us cleaner air and protect our health and our jobs,” he said. Climate scientists warned that overturning the endangerment finding would undermine decades of scientific progress and damage the credibility of U.S. institutions tasked with protecting the environment. The 12 hottest years on record have all occurred since 2009, and heat-related deaths are rising while wildfires are now more frequent and severe, said Scott Saleska, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Arizona. “To repeal the endangerment finding now would be like a driver who is speeding towards a cliff taking his foot off the brake and instead pressing the accelerator,” Saleska said. Jim Walsh, policy director of the environmental group Food & Water Watch, used a more explosive metaphor. “Lee Zeldin’s assertion that the EPA shouldn’t address greenhouse gas emissions is like a fire chief claiming they shouldn’t fight fires,'' he said. “It is as malicious as it is absurd."" ___ Follow the AP's coverage of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency at https://apnews.com/hub/us-environmental-protection-agency.

Cargo surge amid tariff turmoil drives the Port of Savannah to its 2nd busiest year,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/cargo-surge-amid-tariff-turmoil-drives-the-port-of-savannah-to-its-2nd-busiest-year-2025-07-29/,"SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) — Retailers scrambling to stock up ahead of anticipated stiff tariffs on imports boosted the Port of Savannah, one of the top U.S. container ports, to its second-busiest year ever, Georgia officials said Tuesday. The Savannah port moved 5.7 million container units of imports and exports across its docks in the 2025 fiscal year that ended June 30, the Georgia Ports Authority reported. That's an increase of 8.6% over the prior fiscal year and just shy of the record 5.76 million container units Savannah handled in fiscal 2022. The growth was caused in part by a surge in cargo since President Donald Trump returned to office in January promising heavy tariffs on China and other U.S. trading partners. But double-digit increases Savannah saw during the spring months were followed by a sizable drop in June container volumes as Trump's on-again, off-again tactics continued to fuel uncertainty. “It’s just going to be this very up-and-down time until things get settled,"" said Georgia Ports Authority CEO Griff Lynch, who praised Trump's trade deal with the European Union as a step toward restoring stability. “I’m sure all of it will come together. It’s just a matter of timing.” The Port of Savannah is the nation's No. 4 seaport for cargo shipped in containers, giant metal boxes used to transport goods ranging from consumer electronics to frozen chickens by ship, rail and truck. Uncertainty surrounding Trump's tariff policies has resulted in gains, at least in the short term, at other major U.S. ports. A 90-day pause the Republican president placed on new tariffs announced in April gave American retailers and manufacturers a window to build up inventories ahead of new price hikes. What happens to trade volumes in the coming months may depend on a big deadline Friday, when dozens of countries face increased tariffs on goods shipped to the U.S. if they don't reach a deal with the White House. The Port of Los Angeles, the top U.S. container port, reported its busiest June ever to close out fiscal 2025 with 10.5 million container units handled — a 14% increase over the previous year. At the Port of New York and New Jersey, the biggest East Coast port, container volumes from January through May were up 6.5% compared to the same period last year. Gene Seroka, executive director of the Port of Los Angeles, told reporters earlier this month that Trump's tactics have created a “whipsaw effect” as shipping volumes slow down with new tariff announcements, then surge suddenly to take advantage of delayed tariff start dates. The National Retail Federation is forecasting that cargo containers shipped through U.S. ports will drop by double digits from August through November. At the Port of Savannah, container volume jumped 22.5% in March to 533,995 units and remained above 500,000 container units through May. The streak ended in June, when container volumes fell 9.6% compared to a year earlier. Georgia's nearby Port of Brunswick saw automobile shipments drop 2.2% as it moved 811,042 cars and trucks in fiscal 2025. Lynch said tariffs on auto imports factored into the decline. Last year, Brunswick was the top U.S. port for automobiles after passing the Port of Baltimore, which was shut down for weeks after the deadly collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge. Cargo volumes appeared flat in July said Lynch, who anticipates another decline in August. But he said he's optimistic the turbulence won't be prolonged. “If they can nail these tariffs down, we’ll get back to normal trade,"" Lynch said. ___ This story has been corrected to show that automobiles shipped through Georgia declined 2.2% in fiscal 2025, not 16% Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

Deckers Stock Recovers on Strong Earnings—More Upside Ahead?,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/deckers-stock-recovers-on-strong-earningsmore-upside-ahead/,"For Deckers Outdoor NYSE: DECK, 2025 has been a very bad year so far, but things may be turning the corner. On July 24, the shoemaker reported fiscal Q1 2026 financials, and the results were exactly what the stock needed. Shares surged by more than 11% on July 25, helping stem the stock’s more than 48% drop in 2025 through July 24. So, what exactly happened last quarter for Deckers Outdoor, and do the results mark the beginning of a big-time recovery in shares? Let’s dive in to understand what's next. In fiscal Q1, Deckers posted revenue growth of 17%, nearly double the 9.2% growth rate forecasted by analysts. However, it is important to note that more than half of this beat came from abnormal changes in revenue generation timing. Still, this helped the consumer discretionary stock post 24% adjusted earnings per share (EPS) growth, with the absolute figure increasing to 93 cents. This was a huge surprise, as analysts expected adjusted EPS to fall by around 10%. The company also announced guidance for next quarter that was in line with expectations. International revenue spiked by 50% from the previous year's quarter, with the company’s flagship HOKA and UGG brands leading the charge. This marked the firm’s fastest international sales growth over at least the last six quarters. The growth was certainly needed, as U.S. sales fell nearly 3% last quarter in a consumer environment that management called “choppy.” HOKA also generated its most fiscal Q1 revenue ever at $653 million, an increase of 20% compared to the prior year. A notable downside was that gross margin declined by 110 basis points to 55.8%. However, the operating margin moved up by 105 basis points to over 17.1%. Overall, investors can take solace in the fact that Decker’s gross margin remains in the middle of the pack among big footwear stocks, and its operating margin is in the top half. Much of the downtrodden sentiment around Deckers in 2025 has been due to tariffs. The company withdrew its full-year guidance because of the uncertain impact of trade wars on its business. Markets have expressed concerns that the company’s already relatively expensive products might face reduced demand growth due to higher prices. This situation is particularly relevant as most of the company’s production occurs in Vietnam. Latest trade developments put the United States' tariffs on Vietnam at 20%, but the deal is not final. This would be a significant improvement compared to the 46% rate Trump first proposed. In Q2, tariffs didn’t seem to negatively impact demand at Deckers. However, the firm only started increasing prices on July 1, meaning that impacts wouldn’t have shown up in the latest results. Still, management noted that it has not seen initial price increases result in worse performance one month into fiscal Q2. This is a highly positive sign for investors, indicating that Deckers can increase prices while not hurting demand. Still, the results are early and next quarter should really shed some light on just how true this is. Lagging direct-to-consumer (DTC) sales, which barely increased last quarter, are also a concern. Wholesale sales grew strongly at 26.7%. DTC sales, which have higher margins, are more attractive to investors. However, strong wholesale growth signals a potential rebound in DTC growth. Consumers often first become aware of a brand by seeing it in-store. If they like the product, they are more likely to buy directly in the future. As of the July 28 close, DECK is down 45% in 2025. The stock also trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 18x. That’s around 26% below its average figure of over 24x during the last three years. This suggests there is a solid opportunity for the stock’s forward P/E to rise, benefiting shares. The MarketBeat consensus price target on Deckers is around $137, implying upside potential of more than 22% versus July 28. Overall, Deckers has done a solid job of assuaging some fears around its business. Tariff rates on Vietnam are likely to come down from previous proposals, a good sign for Deckers. Absent unexpected tariff changes or a recession, shares of Deckers Outdoor have a solid opportunity to continue their recovery. Still, next quarter will be key to determining if the strong results are sustainable as price increases fully kick in. Before you consider Deckers Outdoor, you'll want to hear this.
