Australian and Chinese leaders seek to boost trade despite differences on other issues,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/australian-and-chinese-leaders-seek-to-boost-trade-despite-differences-on-other-issues-2025-07-14/,"BEIJING (AP) — The leaders of Australia and China sought to deepen trade ties despite their differences over regional security and human rights at talks Tuesday in the Chinese capital. Chinese leader Xi Jinping told Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese that seeking common ground while setting aside differences is in line with ""the fundamental interests of our two countries and our two peoples.” Albanese concurred with Xi's remark, saying “That approach has indeed produced very positive benefits for both Australia and for China.” Australia, like many countries in the Asia-Pacific region, is caught between China and the United States. Its economy is heavily dependent on exports to China, including iron ore for the steel industry. It also shares America's concerns with China’s human rights record and its growing military activity in the Pacific, including in waters near Australia. Albanese has sought to repair Australia's relationship with China since his election in 2022. “One in four of our jobs depends upon trade,” he said at a news conference in Shanghai on Monday. He noted Australia’s efforts to diversify its trade by expanding ties with Southeast Asian nations such as Indonesia and Singapore. Albanese is in Beijing at the midpoint of a weeklong trip to China that started in Shanghai, China’s commercial capital, where government and business leaders from the two countries discussed deepening cooperation in tourism and reducing carbon emissions in iron ore mining and steel production.

Asian shares mostly decline as worries continue over Trump's tariffs,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/asian-shares-mostly-decline-as-worries-continue-over-trumps-tariffs-2025-07-14/,"TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares were mostly lower in early Tuesday trading, as worries about President Donald Trump’s latest updates to his tariffs weighed on investor sentiments. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 rose 0.1% in morning trading to 39,507.28. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.4% to 8,602.70. South Korea's Kospi edged down 0.2% to 3,195.72. Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 0.1% to 24,172.79, while the Shanghai Composite dipped nearly 0.9% after the Chinese government reported that growth slowed in the last quarter as Trump’s trade war escalated. Tuesday's data showed the economy expanded at a robust 5.2% annual pace, compared with 5.4% annual growth in January-March. In quarterly terms, the world’s second-largest economy expanded by 1.1%, according to government data. Despite worries about the damage Trump's tariffs may have on the region's exporters, speculation continues that he may ultimately back down on them. They don't take effect until Aug. 1, which leaves time for more negotiations. On Wall Street Monday, the S&P 500 edged up by 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.2% and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.3%. A nationwide election for the upper house of Japan's Parliament, set for Sunday, also added to the wait-and-see attitude among market players. Analysts say the ruling pro-business Liberal Democratic Party may face an uphill battle and will likely need coalition partners, including possibly new ones, to keep its grip on power. If Trump were to enact all his proposed tariffs on Aug. 1, they would raise the risk of a recession. That would not only hurt American consumers but also raise the pressure on the U.S. government’s debt level relative to the economy’s size, particularly after Washington approved big tax cuts that will add to the deficit. “We therefore believe that the administration is using this latest round of tariff escalation to maximize its negotiating leverage and that it will ultimately de-escalate, especially if there is a new bout of heightened bond and stock market volatility,” according to Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, global head of equities at UBS Global Wealth Management. “As usual, there are many conditions and clauses that can get these rates reduced,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. “That’s probably why the market might not like the tariff talk, but it’s not panicking about it either.” For the time being, the uncertainty around tariffs could help keep markets unsteady. This upcoming week has several potential flashpoints that could shake things up. The latest reading on inflation across the U.S. comes Tuesday, with economists expecting it to show inflation accelerated to 2.6% last month from 2.4% in May. Companies are also lining up to report how they performed during the spring. JPMorgan Chase and several other huge banks will report their latest quarterly results Tuesday, followed by Johnson & Johnson on Wednesday and PepsiCo on Thursday. Fastenal, a distributor of industrial and construction supplies, reported Monday a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Its stock rose 2.9%, though it also said that market conditions remain sluggish. Shares of Kenvue rose 2.3% in shaky trading after the former division of Johnson & Johnson said CEO Thibaut Mongon is stepping down. Kenvue, the maker of Listerine and Band-Aid brands, is in the midst of a strategic review of its options, “including ways to simplify the company’s portfolio and how it operates,” according to board chair Larry Merlo. Some of the biggest moves in financial markets were for crypto, where bitcoin continues to set records. This upcoming week is Crypto Week in Washington, where Congress will consider several bills to “make America the crypto capital of the world.” In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude fell 31 cents to $66.67 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, declined 25 cents to $68.96 a barrel. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar declined to 147.59 Japanese yen from 147.72 yen. The euro cost $1.1676, up from $1.1666. ___ AP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed to this report. Before you consider PepsiCo, you'll want to hear this.

A Florida county leads the way with a high-tech 911 system that improves emergency response,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/a-florida-county-leads-the-way-with-a-high-tech-911-system-that-improves-emergency-response-2025-07-14/,"NAPLES, Fla. (AP) — When an emergency happens in Collier County, Florida, the 911 calls go to one of the most high-tech communications centers in the U.S., where callers can sent text and video from the scene to dispatchers. Moving to what's known as an NG911 — or Next Generation 911 — system is a journey Sheriff Kevin Rambosk and Bob Finney, the county's director of communication, have been on for much of the past decade. It's a long way from Feb. 16, 1968, when Alabama's then-House Speaker Rankin Fite made the nation's very first 911 call in Haleyville, Alabama, on a bright red, rotary-style landline telephone. That ceremonial call came just 35 days after AT&T announced plans to use 911 as a nationwide emergency number. Today, most calls to 911 originate with cellphones, with dispatchers in upgraded centers using geo tracking to get accurate geographic locations from callers. But the response time in an emergency depends on the type of technology being used at any of the 6,000 emergency communications centers in the U.S. that receive 911 calls. There is no uniform emergency system in the U.S., so individual cities, counties, states or geographic regions are responsible for operating their own 911 call centers. While some states have fully updated to NG911 systems, others are still using legacy 911 systems that rely on antiquated equipment. “We’re just reminded in these last two weeks, with the flooding in Texas, just how important the work of 911 is,” said Michael Martin, CEO of RapidSOS, which provides infrastructure that passes critical data to emergency centers across the United States. The Collier County Sheriff's Office covers 911 calls from an area of about 2,030 square miles (5,258 square kilometers) that stretches from sandy beaches at the southernmost tip of the Gulf Coast on Florida's peninsula inland to the Everglades. It's a region that has been ravaged by hurricanes this century, including Hurricane Irma in 2017 and Hurricanes Ian and Milton most recently. That's why Sheriff Rambosk wanted a high-tech emergency operations center. “We just believe that when we can reduce the response time using technology, it will improve safety and survivability of those calling in,” said Rambosk, who has been sheriff since 2009. “And that’s really what we’re all about, keeping people safe and rescuing them when they need it.” Today 61 full-time employees and three part-timers staff two emergency operations centers around the clock. They rely on data that RapidSOS collects from connected buildings, devices, vehicles and even smart watches to send first responders to emergency scenes. The baseline data is provide free of charge to all 911 centers, Martin said. As Hurricane Helene was tracking toward north Florida last September, forecasters were predicting it could hit Tallahassee as a major Category 3 storm. Officials in Leon County, which serves the state's Capitol and nearby counties on legacy 911 equipment, reached out to Collier County, some 430 miles (692 kilometers) to the southeast, to see if they could take over emergency calls if the storm knocked their center out. Helene moved to the east of Tallahassee, but Collier County was prepared to help if needed. ""Because of the partnership with Rapid SOS, they were able to create a map to where not only did we see our own calls, but we could see exactly where the calls were coming in Tallahassee,” Finney said. Collier County has also partnered with Charleston, South Carolina, as a backup 911 center. Each region is fully prepared to take on 911 calls for the other in case their emergency system goes down for any reason. It's a similar story in North Carolina, where legislation in 2017 helped establish funding for a next generation 911 system, said Pokey Harris, who serves as president of the National Association of State 911 Administrators and executive director of the North Carolina 911 Board. Harris said Hurricane Helene provided validation for the upgraded system by being able to direct 911 calls from areas that were devastated by the storm to other parts of North Carolina that were not affected. “During Helene, if a citizen could reach a dial tone, even though their local 911 center may have been impacted because of infrastructure devastation, another center somewhere in the state could answer their call,” Harris said. Next Generation 911 systems aren't cheap. “There has been no federal funding for 911,” Martin, of RapidSOS said. “It has been in various draft formats as long as I’ve been doing this and it’s never gotten through Congress.” There is also no federal oversight of 911, he said. “It’s really quite remarkable how well 911 works despite those challenges,"" Martin said. “I think it’s a testament to the people of 911, not the technology.” Before you consider Harris, you'll want to hear this.

Trump and Sen. Dave McCormick team up to promote energy investments in Pennsylvania,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-and-sen-dave-mccormick-team-up-to-promote-energy-investments-in-pennsylvania-2025-07-14/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump and Sen. David McCormick of Pennsylvania will jointly announce roughly $70 billion of energy investments in the state Tuesday as the president travels to Pittsburgh for a conference with dozens of top executives to promote his energy and technology agenda. The Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit will be held at Carnegie Mellon University, and it comes as the state's political and business leaders are working to forge the city into a hub for robotics, artificial intelligence and energy. Trump has repeatedly pledged U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market, and Pennsylvania — a swing state critical to his wins in 2016 and 2024 — is at the forefront of that agenda, in large part due to its coal industry that the Republican administration has taken several steps to bolster. Neither the White House nor McCormick's office gave breakdowns of the $70 billion or what the investments entail. McCormick, a Republican first-term senator who is organizing the inaugural event, says the summit is meant to bring together top energy companies and AI leaders, global investors and labor behind Trump's energy policies and priorities. He says the investments will spur tens of thousands of jobs in Pennsylvania. “Pennsylvania is uniquely positioned because of abundant energy, of incredible skilled workers, technology,” McCormick said in a Fox News interview Monday promoting the summit. “We need to win the battle for AI innovation in America, and Pennsylvania is at the center of it.” The list of participating CEOs includes leaders from global behemoths like Blackstone, SoftBank, Amazon Web Services, BlackRock and ExxonMobil and local companies such as the Pittsburgh-based Gecko Robotics, which deploys AI to bolster energy capacity. Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, will also attend. Administration officials speaking at the summit include White House crypto czar David Sacks, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Energy Secretary Chris Wright. In the Fox News interview, McCormick credited his wife, Dina Powell McCormick, with the idea for a summit. Powell McCormick served as Trump’s deputy national security adviser in his first term and is a former Goldman Sachs executive who is now at BDT & MSD Partners, a merchant bank. Pittsburgh is home to Carnegie Mellon University, a prestigious engineering school, plus a growing industry of small robotics firms and a so-called “ AI Avenue ” that’s home to offices for Google and other AI firms. It also sits in the middle of the prolific Marcellus Shale natural gas reservoir. Pennsylvania has scored several big investment wins in recent months, some of it driven by federal manufacturing policy and others by the ravenous need for electricity from the fast-growing AI business. Nippon Steel just bought U.S. Steel for almost $15 billion, getting Trump’s approval after pledging to invest billions alone in U.S. Steel’s Pittsburgh-area plants. Amazon will spend $20 billion on two data center complexes in Pennsylvania, with more to come, while a one-time coal-fired power plant is being turned into the nation’s largest gas-fired power plant to fuel a data center campus. Meanwhile, Microsoft says it is spending $1.6 billion to reopen the lone functional nuclear reactor on Three Mile Island under a long-term power supply agreement for its data centers. Shapiro, elected in 2022, has been pushing for the state to land a big multibillion-dollar industrial project, like a semiconductor factory or an electric vehicle plant. In his first budget speech, Shapiro — who is viewed as a potential White House contender in 2028 — told lawmakers that Pennsylvania needs to “get in the game” and warned that it would take money. He didn’t land a mega project, but he instead has worked to play up big investments by Amazon and Microsoft, as well as Nippon Steel, as he prepares to seek a second term. ___ Levy reported from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

Nvidia's CEO says it has US approval to sell its H20 AI computer chips in China,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/nvidias-ceo-says-it-has-approval-to-sell-its-h20-ai-computer-chips-in-china-2025-07-14/,"BANGKOK (AP) — Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang says the technology giant has won approval from the Trump administration to sell its advanced H20 computer chips used to develop artificial intelligence to China. The news came in a company blog post late Monday and Huang also spoke about the coup on China’s state-run CGTN television network in remarks shown on X. “The U.S. government has assured Nvidia that licenses will be granted, and Nvidia hopes to start deliveries soon,” the post said. “Today, I'm announcing that the U.S. government has approved for us filing licenses to start shipping H20s,” Huang told reporters in Beijing. He noted that half of the world's AI researchers are in China. “It's so innovative and dynamic here in China that it's really important that American companies are able to compete and serve the market here in China,” he said. Huang recently met with Trump and other U.S. policymakers and this week is in Beijing to attend a supply chain conference and speak with Chinese officials. The broadcast showed Huang meeting with Ren Hongbin, the head of the China Council for Promotion of International Trade, host of the China International Supply Chain Expo, which Huang was attending. Nvidia is an exhibitor. Nvidia has profited enormously from rapid adoption of AI, becoming the first company to have its market value surpass $4 trillion last week. However, the trade rivalry between the U.S. and China has been weighing heavily on the industry. Washington has been tightening controls on exports of advanced technology to China for years, citing concerns that know-how meant for civilian use could be deployed for military purposes. The emergence of China’s DeepSeek AI chatbot in January renewed concerns over how China might use the advanced chips to help develop its own AI capabilities. In January, before Trump began his second term in office, the administration of President Joe Biden launched a new framework for exporting advanced computer chips used to develop artificial intelligence, an attempt to balance national security concerns about the technology with the economic interests of producers and other countries. The White House announced in April that it would restrict sales of Nvidia’s H20 chips and AMD’s MI308 chips to China. Nvidia had said the tighter export controls would cost the company an extra $5.5 billion, and Huang and other technology leaders have been lobbying President Donald Trump to reverse the restrictions. They argue that such limits hinder U.S. competition in a leading edge sector in one of the world’s largest markets for technology. They've also warned that U.S. export controls could end up pushing other countries toward China’s AI technology. ___ AP researcher Yu Bing in Beijing contributed.

Chinese economy grows at a 5.2% annual pace in April-June quarter despite trade war,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/chinese-economy-grows-at-a-52-annual-pace-in-april-june-quarter-despite-trade-war-2025-07-14/,"BANGKOK (AP) — China's economy slowed in the last quarter as President Donald Trump’s trade war escalated, but it still expanded at a robust 5.2% pace, the government said Tuesday. That compares with 5.4% annual growth in January-March. The government said Tuesday that in quarterly terms, the world’s second largest economy expanded by 1.1%. In the first half of the year, the Chinese economy grew at a 5.3% annual pace, the official data show. However, some analysts said actual growth may have been significantly slower. Zichun Huang of Capital Economics noted that investments in fixed assets such as factory equipment rose only 2.8% in the first half of the year, implying 2.9% annual growth in May and a mere 0.5% increase in June. Capital Economics' activity proxy shows growth in China's gross domestic product, or GDP, at less than 4% year-on-year in April and May, she said, forecasting annual growth of 3.5% for full-year 2025. “The economic outlook for the rest of the year remains challenging,” Huang wrote in a report. She added though that “political pressure to meet annual growth targets, even if only on paper, means that published GDP growth will be much higher.” A key factor was strong exports. On Monday, China reported that its exports accelerated in June, rising 5.8% from a year earlier, up from a 4.8% increase in May. A reprieve on painfully high tariffs on Chinese exports to the United States prompted a rush of orders by companies and consumers as the two sides resumed trade talks. Chinese companies also have expanded exports to and offshore manufacturing in other countries, helping to offset the impact of higher tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. “Generally speaking, with the more proactive and effective macro policies taking effect ... the national economy maintained steady growth with good momentum, showcasing strong resilience and vitality,” the report by the National Bureau of Statistics said. However, a 0.1% decline in consumer prices in the first half of 2025 showed continuing weakness in domestic demand, a long-term challenge for the ruling communist party as the Chinese population declines and ages. Those troubles deepened during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Chinese leaders have set a growth target of 5% for this year, in line with last year's growth. A resumption of U.S. tariffs of up to 245% if Washington and Beijing fail to meet an Aug. 12 deadline for a new trade deal could derail the recovery in exports, a major driver of growth and employment. ___ AP Researcher Yu Bing in Beijing contributed.

U.S. inflation may have worsened last month as Trump's tariffs start to bite,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/us-inflation-may-have-worsened-last-month-as-trumps-tariffs-start-to-bite-2025-07-14/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Inflation likely accelerated in June as sweeping tariffs on nearly all imports may have pushed up prices for electronics, appliances, and other goods, economists forecast. Consumer prices probably rose 2.6% last month from a year ago, up from an annual increase of 2.4% in May, according to data provider FactSet. The Labor Department will issue its inflation report at 8:30 a.m. eastern. On a monthly basis, prices likely rose 0.3% from May to June, the largest increase since January, economists project. Worsening inflation could pose a political challenge for President Donald Trump, who promised during last year's presidential campaign to immediately lower costs. The sharp inflation spike of 2022-2023 was the worst in four decades and soured most Americans on former president Joe Biden's handling of the economy. Faster price increases would also likely underscore the Federal Reserve's reluctance to cut its short-term interest rate, as Trump is loudly demanding. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, inflation is forecast to have risen 3% in June from a year earlier, up from a 2.8% rise in May. On a monthly basis, it is also expected to have picked up 0.3% from May to June, according to FactSet. Economists closely watch core prices because they typically provide a better sense of where inflation is headed. Trump has imposed sweeping duties of 10% on all imports, plus 50% levies on steel and aluminum, 30% on goods from China, and 25% on imported cars. Just last week the president threatened to hit the European Union with a new 30% tariff starting Aug. 1. So far, the tariffs haven't noticeably pushed up inflation, which has been mild for the past four months. Core inflation has fallen from 3.3% in January to 2.8% in May, though that is still above the Fed's 2% target. If inflation in June is much weaker than economists forecast, Trump will likely renew his demands that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell immediately reduce borrowing costs. Powell and other Fed officials have emphasized that they want to see how the economy evolves as the tariffs take effect before cutting their key short-term rate. The Fed chair has said that the duties could both push up prices and slow the economy, a tricky combination for the central bank since higher costs would typically lead the Fed to hike rates while a weaker economy often spurs it to reduce them. Trump on Monday said that Powell has been “terrible” and “doesn’t know what the hell he’s doing.” The president added that the economy was doing well despite Powell’s refusal to reduce rates, but it would be “nice” if there were rate cuts “because people would be able to buy housing a lot easier.” Last week, White House officials also attacked Powell for cost overruns on the years-long renovation of two Fed buildings, which are now slated to cost $2.5 billion, roughly one-third more than originally budgeted. While Trump legally can't fire Powell just because he disagrees with his interest rate decisions, the Supreme Court has signaled, he may be able to do so “for cause,” such as misconduct or mismanagement. While inflation was mild in May, there were already signs in last month's report that tariffs were starting to have some impact. The cost of furniture, appliances, toys, and tools rose, though those increases were offset by falling prices for airfares, hotels, and muted rises in rental costs. Some companies have said they have or plan to raise prices as a result of the tariffs, including Walmart, the world's largest retailer. Automaker Mitsubishi said last month that it was lifting prices by an average of 2.1% in response to the duties, and Nike has said it would implement “surgical” price hikes to offset tariff costs. But many companies have been able to postpone or avoid price increases, after building up their stockpiles of goods this spring to get ahead of the duties. Other companies may have refrained from lifting prices while they wait to see whether the U.S. is able to reach trade deals with other countries that lower the duties.

"Robot umpires to make All-Star Game debut, another step toward possible regular-season use in 2026",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/robot-umpires-to-make-all-star-game-debut-another-step-toward-possible-regular-season-use-in-2026-2025-07-14/,"ATLANTA (AP) — Tarik Skubal views the strike zone differently than robot umpires. “I have this thing where I think everything is a strike until the umpire calls it a ball,” Detroit's AL Cy Young Award winner said ahead of his start for the American League in Tuesday night's All-Star Game. MLB has been experimenting with the automated ball-strike system in the minor leagues since 2019 and will use it in an All-Star Game for the first time this summer. Each team gets two challenges and retains the challenge if it is successful. “Pitchers think everything is a strike. Then you go back and look at it, and it’s two, three balls off,” Pittsburgh's Paul Skenes, starting his second straight All-Star Game for the National League, said Monday. “We should not be the ones that are challenging it.” MLB sets the top of the automated strike zone at 53.5% of a batter's height and the bottom at 27%, basing the decision on the midpoint of the plate, 8 1/2 inches from the front and 8 1/2 inches from the back. That contrasts with the rule book zone called by umpires, which says the zone is a cube. “I did a few rehabs starts with it. I’m OK with it. I think it works,” said three-time Cy Young Award winner Clayton Kershaw of the Dodgers. “Aaron Judge and Jose Altuve should have different sized boxes. They've obviously thought about that. As long as that gets figured out, I think it’ll be fine.” Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred anticipates the system will be considered by the sport's 11-man competition committee, which includes six management representatives. Many pitchers have gravitated to letting their catchers and managers trigger ball/strike appeals. Teams won 52.2% of their challenges during the spring training test. Batters won exactly 50% of their 596 challenges and the defense 54%, with catchers successful 56% of the time and pitchers 41%. Hall of Famer Joe Torre, an honorary AL coach, favors the system. After his managing career, he worked for MLB and helped supervised expanded video review in 2014. “You couldn’t ignore it with all the technology out there,” he said. ""You couldn't sit and make an excuse for, 'Look at what really happened' the next day.” Now 84, Torre recalled how his Yankees teams benefitted at least twice from blown calls in the postseason, including one involving the strike zone. With the 1998 World Series opener tied and the bases loaded with two outs in the seventh inning, Tino Martinez took a 2-2 pitch from San Diego's Mark Langston that appeared to be a strike but was called a ball by Richie Garcia. Martinez hit a grand slam on the next pitch for a 9-5 lead, and the Yankees went on to a four-game sweep. Asked whether he was happy there was no robot umpire then, Torre grinned and said: “Possibly.” Then he added without a prompt: “Well, not to mention the home run that Jeter hit."" His reference was to Derek Jeter's home run in the 1996 AL Championship Series opener, when 12-year-old fan Jeffrey Maier reached over the wall to snatch the ball above the glove over Baltimore right fielder Tony Tarasco. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

Tesla's Autopilot system is in the spotlight at a Miami trial over a student killed while stargazing,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/teslas-autopilot-system-is-in-the-spotlight-at-a-miami-trial-over-a-student-killed-while-stargazing-2025-07-14/,"NEW YORK (AP) — A rare trial against Elon Musk's car company began Monday in Miami where a jury will decide if it is partly to blame for the death of a stargazing university student after a runaway Tesla sent her flying 75 feet through the air and severely injured her boyfriend. Lawyers for the plaintiff argue that Tesla’s driver-assistance feature called Autopilot should have warned the driver and braked when his Model S sedan blew through flashing red lights, a stop sign and a T-intersection at nearly 70 miles an hour in the April 2019 crash. Tesla lays the blame solely on the driver, who was reaching for a dropped cell phone. “The evidence clearly shows that this crash had nothing to do with Tesla’s Autopilot technology,” Tesla said in a statement. “Instead, like so many unfortunate accidents since cellphones were invented, this was caused by a distracted driver.” The driver, George McGee, was sued separately by the plaintiffs. That case was settled. A judgement against Tesla could be especially damaging as the company works to convince the public its self-driving technology is safe during a planned rollout of hundreds of thousands of Tesla robotaxis on U.S. roads by the end of next year. A jury trial is rare for the company, whose suits over crashes are often dismissed or settled, and this one is rarer yet because a judge recently ruled that the family of the stricken Naibel Benavides Leon can argue for punitive damages. The judge, Beth Bloom of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, issued a partial summary judgement last month, throwing out charges of defective manufacturing and negligent misrepresentation against Tesla. But she also ruled plaintiffs could argue other claims that would make the company liable and ask for punitive damages, which could prove costly. “A reasonable jury could find that Tesla acted in reckless disregard of human life for the sake of developing their product and maximizing profit,” Bloom said in a filing. The 2021 lawsuit alleges the driver relied on Autopilot to reduce speed or come to a stop when it detected objects in its way, including a parked Chevrolet Tahoe that Benavides and her boyfriend, Dillon Angulo, had gotten out of near Key West, Florida, to look up at the sky. The Tesla rammed the Tahoe at highway speeds, causing it to rotate and slam into Benavides, tossing her into a wooded area and killing her. In legal documents, Tesla denied nearly all of the lawsuit’s allegations and said it expects that consumers will follow warnings in the vehicle and instructions in the owners’ manual, as well as comply with driving laws. Tesla warns owners in manuals that its cars cannot drive themselves and they need to be ready to intervene at all times. Plaintiff lawyers argue that Tesla should have a geofenced its Autopilot so it only worked on the big roads it was designed for and drivers couldn’t use it on smaller roads such as the rural one where Benavides was killed. They also say data and video evidence shows the Autopilot did detect the Tahoe but then failed to warn the driver as they claim it should have done. Tesla has since improved its driver-assistance and partial self-driving features, but still faces lawsuits and investigations over what critics say is a gap between its exaggerated depictions of how well they work and what they can actually do. Federal auto safety regulators recalled 2.3 million Teslas in 2023 for problems with Autopilot failing to sufficiently alert drivers if they weren’t paying attention to the road. They then put Tesla under investigation last year for saying it fixed the problem though it was unclear it actually did that. Musk has also continued to make public comments suggesting Tesla’s “Full Self-Driving” technology, a more advanced version of Autopilot, allows cars to drive themselves, despite warnings from regulators not to do so because it could lead to overreliance on the systems, crashes and deaths. That technology has been involved in three fatal crashes and is under investigation of its ability to see in low-visibility conditions such as sunlight glare or fog. Tesla is promising a much more robust self-driving technology to power its robotaxis with no one behind the wheel. A test run in Austin, Texas, of the taxis appears to have gone mostly well, though there are scattered problems, such as a case when one cab went down the opposing lane. —— Former AP auto writer Krisher reported from Detroit.

These 3 Undervalued Stocks Could Surge as Value Rotation Nears,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/these-3-undervalued-stocks-could-surge-as-value-rotation-nears/,"One of the most reliable gauges of sentiment in the stock market is where growth stocks trade relative to value stocks, since any given extreme can signal above-average optimism or pessimism, creating opportunities for investors to ride a return to balance. Toda’s market appears to be driven by extreme optimism, prompting investors to delve deeper into identifying value and potential upside. By charting the iShares S&P 500 Value ETF NYSEARCA: IVE against the iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF NYSEARCA: IVW, investors can clearly see that value stocks have fallen behind by a wide margin, in fact, the widest margin over the past decade. Chances are that a big “catch-up” play may happen soon, triggering a rotation back into these forgotten high-quality businesses. Some of these stocks may include Johnson & Johnson NYSE: JNJ, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. NYSE: BRK.B, and even Intel Corp. NASDAQ: INTC. With a blend of the technology sector and other stable areas of the United States economy, this list could provide investors with a basket of reasonable upside and very limited downside risk due to today’s discounts. Even though Johnson & Johnson stock is nearing its 52-week high, other measures of valuation are falling behind in the broader value stock theme. The company’s forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 14.9x today falls short of the historical average of just about 19.5x, creating a wide enough gap to be filled by a healthy rally. This simple measure of discounts present in a $377.5 billion giant in the medical space may have triggered some value hunters in the market, such as those from Assenagon Asset Management, who boosted their holdings in Johnson & Johnson stock by as much as 160% as of early July 2025. After this new allocation, the group now holds up to $635.3 million worth of the stock, giving investors another bullish pillar to lean on in their own views. With this in mind, chances are rapidly increasing that Johnson & Johnson stock may see higher prices sooner rather than later, and that is something Wall Street analysts agree with. Such as Shagun Singh, an analyst from the Royal Bank of Canada, who reiterated an Outperform rating on Johnson & Johnson stock alongside a price target of $181 per share. This valuation directly calls for a net upside potential of as much as 16%, which is not a common achievement for a company of this size. One of the certainties in the stock market's history is that value investor Warren Buffett is likely to outperform the broader S&P 500 index. The best way for investors to learn from him and improve their returns is by investing in a basket of high-quality value stocks. This basket is called Berkshire Hathaway, and it is part of the outperformance now seen across value stocks as well. Over the past quarter alone, Berkshire Hathaway has fallen behind by as much as 26% compared to the S&P 500 index, a massive discount gap that investors will regret not taking advantage of in the coming months. As valuations go, Berkshire Hathaway’s 1.6x price-to-book (P/B) ratio falls greatly behind the financial sector’s average of 2.3x. This provides investors with another benchmark to which the stock falls below and yet another gap to be filled in terms of upside. Speaking of the upside, Kein Heal, an Argus analyst, has a recent rating on Berkshire Hathaway that indicates a valuation of up to $575 per share, which hasn’t been updated since March 2025 to reflect high confidence in a potential rise of as much as 21% from today’s prices. Assenagon wasn’t only buying Johnson & Johnson this time around; they also justified an 86.4% boost to their Intel stock positions, bringing their entire stake to a high of $508.6 million today. Intel stock is appealing not just because it trades at only 63% of its 52-week high, but also due to a current industry catalyst. As the United States deepens its agenda of reshoring semiconductor and chipmaking supply chains, Intel’s presence within the country could further attract investor interest and raise demand and price. Considering this is a high-profile government theme in the world of artificial intelligence development, investors can gauge the recent buying activity of United States Congress members for Intel stock as a positive sign. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Ro Khanna, and Jefferson Shreve (among others) have been some government officials who bought Intel stock recently. After all, Intel is one of the names better positioned to respond to a call for onshoring the semiconductor supply chain, and also one of the cheapest ones to enjoy a ride back to value stocks on top of this broader industry catalyst.

US imposes a 17% duty on fresh Mexican tomatoes in hopes of boosting domestic production,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/us-imposes-a-17-duty-on-fresh-mexican-tomatoes-2025-07-14/,"The U.S. government said Monday it is immediately placing a 17% duty on most fresh Mexican tomatoes after negotiations ended without an agreement to avert the tariff. Proponents said the import tax will help rebuild the shrinking U.S. tomato industry and ensure that produce eaten in the U.S. is also grown there. Mexico currently supplies around 70% of the U.S. tomato market, up from 30% two decades ago, according to the Florida Tomato Exchange. Robert Guenther, the trade group's executive vice president, said the duty was “an enormous victory for American tomato farmers and American agriculture."" But opponents said the import tax will make tomatoes more expensive for U.S. consumers. Mexico's Economic Secretary Marcelo Ebrard said the government would continue looking for a way to once again suspend the tariff, part of ongoing negotiations between the two trading partners. In a statement Monday, he wrote that the move would ""only affect the pockets of American consumers. “It's unfair and against not only Mexican producers, but on the American industry. The ground that Mexican fresh tomatoes has gained in the U.S. is because of the quality of the product, not from unfair practices,"" he wrote. Mexican greenhouses specialize in vine-ripened tomatoes, while Florida tomatoes are typically grown in fields and picked green. Tim Richards, a professor at the Morrison School of Agribusiness at Arizona State University, said U.S. retail prices for tomatoes will likely rise around 8.5% with a 17% duty. Jacob Jensen, a trade policy analyst at the American Action Forum, a right-leaning policy institute, said areas with a higher reliance on Mexican tomatoes could see price increases close to 10%, since it will be more difficult to replace that supply, while other parts of the U.S. could see price increases closer to 6%. “As an industry, we are saddened that American consumers will have to pay a tomato tax, or duty, for a reduced selection of the tomatoes they prefer, such as tomatoes on the vine, grape tomatoes, Romas, cocktail tomatoes and other specialty varieties,” said Lance Jungmeyer, president of the Fresh Produce Association of the Americas, which represents importers of Mexican tomatoes. The duty stems from a longstanding U.S. complaint about Mexico's tomato exports and is separate from the 30% base tariff on products made in Mexico and the European Union that President Donald Trump announced Saturday. The Commerce Department said in late April that it was withdrawing from a deal it first reached with Mexico in 2019 to settle allegations the country was exporting tomatoes to the U.S. at artificially low prices, a practice known as dumping. As part of the deal, Mexico had to sell its tomatoes at a minimum price and abide by other rules. Since then, the agreement has been subject to periodic reviews, but the two sides always reached an agreement that avoided duties. In announcing its withdrawal from the Tomato Suspension Agreement, the Commerce Department said it had been “flooded with comments” from U.S. tomato growers who wanted better protection from Mexican goods. “Mexico remains one of our greatest allies, but for far too long our farmers have been crushed by unfair trade practices that undercut pricing on produce like tomatoes. That ends today,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in a statement. “This rule change is in line with President Trump’s trade policies and approach with Mexico.” But others, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Restaurant Association, had called on the Commerce Department to reach an agreement with Mexico. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, and Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, had also urged the Commerce Department to leave the current tomato agreement in place. In a letter sent to Lutnick last week, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and 30 other business groups said U.S. companies employ 50,000 workers and generate $8.3 billion in economic benefits moving tomatoes from Mexico into communities across the country. “We are concerned that withdrawing from the agreement — at a time when the business community is already navigating significant trade uncertainty — could lead to retaliatory actions by our trading partners against other commodities and crops that could create further hardship for U.S. businesses and consumers,” the letter said. —— Associated Press journalist Megan Janetsky contributed to this report from Mexico City.

Tilray Shares Blazing: What's Behind the 55% Rally This Month?,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/tilray-shares-blazing-whats-behind-the-55-rally-this-month/,"Tilray Brands Inc. NASDAQ: TLRY, once a leading light in the legal cannabis industry with shares trading as high as nearly $150, has seen its stock price almost entirely collapse in recent years. A multitude of factors may be to blame—the lack of federal legalization of recreational cannabis, regulatory inconsistencies, problems matching supply and demand, and more have all devastated the industry. Nonetheless, Tilray shares have behaved remarkably around the midpoint of 2025, rising by some 55% in a one-month span. Could it be that projected cash flow and profitability, the possibility of more favorable regulatory environments, and an expanded geographical and product focus could inspire a long-term turnaround for a company that is down more than 99% from its all-time share price high? To be sure, Tilray remains a highly risky bet, but investors with the tolerance to approach a volatile industry might find reasons to consider it. Tilray has long faced a profitability hurdle, and while the company has yet to achieve consistent positive cash flow, some analysts believe it could accomplish this goal in the coming quarters. The company has boosted its margins—the most recent quarter saw the highest cannabis gross margins in about two years, rising to 41% from 33% a year earlier. Additionally, the company achieved an overall gross margin of 28% compared with 26% for the prior-year quarter. Tilray has also been focused on reducing debt and has been largely successful in these efforts. As of the third-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings release, the company's debt level was under 1x its trailing 12-month EBITDA. Further, the firm's beverage arm is making progress on Project 420, an initiative to reduce costs and improve efficiency and profitability that is expected to be completed in the next year. All of these factors may have contributed to Tilray's recent rally, although investors should keep in mind that the firm still faces financial uncertainty. The latest earnings report revised the company's fiscal 2025 revenue estimates down to a range of $850 million to $900 million from a prior range of $950 million to $1 billion. Despite recent successes, Tilray also still underperformed analyst predictions in the latest earnings round. Another driver of TLRY's recent price increase could be optimism about the regulatory environment under the second Trump administration. Advocates have anticipated that the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) might reclassify cannabis to Schedule III from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act, a move that would maintain the status of the drug as illegal on a federal level while allowing for more robust medical research. Unfortunately for supporters of this change, though, the DEA has continued to postpone these efforts for several months. However, the rescheduling process may be restarted if Terrance Cole is confirmed as the next DEA Administrator following a five-month period since his nomination to the position by President Trump. Tilray has broadened its product lineup considerably in recent quarters. Most recently, the company added a new line of summer cannabis products through subsidiaries, affirming the central role cannabis continues to play in its operations. It has been about two years since Tilray acquired a significant beverage portfolio from Anheuser-Busch. The company has continued to bulk up its holdings in that area as it has become one of the largest craft brewers in the U.S. The company's beverage revenues continue to climb. On the cannabis front, the firm recently gained critical authorization from the Italian Ministry of Health to import and distribute its own proprietary medical cannabis flowers for therapeutic purposes. Alongside the company's endeavors throughout Europe, this latest development could help to cement Tilray's position in a burgeoning and largely unaddressed market. Despite these positive developments, investors should exercise caution before making a Tilray investment. The company's share count has repeatedly increased in recent years, and the recent rally threatens its value prospects. Ultimately, though, the biggest risk with a TLRY investment might simply be that the legal cannabis industry overall has yet to establish itself in the United States, and even well-known companies like Tilray currently lack stability.

3 Retail Stocks to Watch as Back-to-School Spending Ramps Up,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/3-retail-stocks-to-watch-as-back-to-school-spending-ramps-up/,"We’re past the Fourth of July, which marks the official second half of the year. For retailers, this also means the beginning of the back-to-school shopping season. This is the second biggest retail season after the holiday season. According to estimates from the National Retail Federation, in 2024, U.S. consumers spent $38.8 billion on back-to-school supplies, an average of $874.68 per household. That number was down from the record high of $41.5 billion spent in 2023. But this year, 71% of parents expect to spend more, with estimates that households will spend an average of $1,230 to get their kids back to school ready. For investors, this is a good time to look at companies that could be ready to deliver strong numbers. Many retailers don’t report earnings until the end of August or early September. That will give investors their first look at spending trends. However, it’s never too early to forecast the likely winners and here are 3 compelling stocks to consider. Walmart Inc. NYSE: WMT stock has delivered a total return of more than 39% in the last year and over 144% in the last five years. Through a global pandemic, generational high inflation, followed by generational high interest rates, the retailer has continued to show why it’s a great investment. However, even Walmart hasn’t been immune to changes in consumer discretionary spending. The company is noticing that the low- to middle-income consumer is holding back on discretionary purchases. But back-to-school spending isn’t discretionary, and Walmart will be a place that those shoppers go for the lowest prices. Among retail stocks, it’s hard to find areas of concern with Walmart. However, it’s fair to note that investors are paying a premium for the stock. That’s been true for some time. But the company’s full-year earnings per share (EPS) guidance for 2026 was between $2.50 to $2.60. Even at the high end, that’s not much of a boost from the prior year. Still, the Walmart analyst forecasts on MarketBeat give WMT stock a consensus price target of $106.67, which would be an 11% gain from its July 10 levels. Investors are also nearly certain to receive a dividend increase, which would make it 54 consecutive years of increases for this dividend king. Back-to-school shopping is about more than pens and paper. It’s also about cleats and other equipment that student athletes need. That’s where DICK’S Sporting Goods Inc. NYSE: DKS comes in. The company is a go-to retailer for sporting equipment. In fact, the company just concluded its DICK’S Deal Days summer sporting event. Over the last five years, DICK’S has accelerated its online presence. This was one reason the stock spiked in 2020 and enjoyed another strong year in 2024. At around $212 per share, DKS stock is trading near the analyst consensus price of around $219. However, since the company’s last earnings report in May, several analysts have issued price targets over consensus, with the highest coming from Bank of America NYSE: BAC at $240. Plus, the stock is trading in the middle of its 52-week range, which leaves even more room to the upside. Another reason for investors to eye DKS stock as a back-to-school winner is its recent acquisition of Foot Locker. That’s expected to close in the second half of 2025 so it won’t impact the current results but is likely to provide an upside boost to future guidance. Target Corp. NYSE: TGT isn’t just one of the worst-performing retail stocks in 2025; it’s held that crown for several years. In fact, despite being a dividend king with 54 consecutive years of dividend increases, Target has generated a negative total return of around 1.4% for investors over the last five years. However, there are some glimmers of hope that may serve as a catalyst for an objectively undervalued stock. First, the United States has reached a tariff agreement with Vietnam. The new 20% tariff on imports from Vietnam is double the prior 10% level, but significantly better than the 46% level the administration proposed on Liberation Day. That should help Target provide more specific guidance. The company said in its prior earnings call that it expects to offset much of the new tariff costs through diversified sourcing, vendor negotiations, and assortment adjustments rather than price increases. Plus, analysts expect a change in the C-suite with current chief executive officer (CEO) Brian Cornell’s contract ending in September. Cornell agreed to a 3-year extension in 2022 but is now past Target’s traditional retirement age. However, investors may see that as a welcome change, particularly if the next executive comes from outside the company. TGT stock may fall further. However, it is also undervalued at 11x earnings and a 0.44 price-to-sales (P/S) ratio. Both statements can be true, but investors should look at the scenario that offers the best upside. A little boost in revenue and earnings would do a lot to boost the TGT share price. Before you consider Target, you'll want to hear this.

How Texas Roadhouse Is Winning in a Changing Consumer Market,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/how-texas-roadhouse-is-winning-in-a-changing-consumer-market/,"Restaurant-goers have developed a bit of a Goldilocks attitude lately, demanding high-quality food, prompt service, and a price point that warrants repeat visits. It’s hard to blame a cash-strapped consumer for demanding top-notch food and excellent service, especially when cooking at home remains a more affordable option. Still, these shifting trends have given rise to fast-casual establishments like Raising Cane’s and Shake Shack, where hungry people can get quick and satisfying meals at affordable prices. Fast-casual demand is a real impulse, and Texas Roadhouse NASDAQ: TXRH has put itself in a good position to ride these shifting tides. The restaurant sector is a lot like the NFL: you need a quarterback like Patrick Mahomes one year and a running back like Saquon Barkley the next. Diners today are less interested in popular 90s-style chains and quick-service fast food. Budget-conscious consumers are instead flocking to fast-casual restaurants, and Texas Roadhouse is embracing these new preferences through a series of innovative measures. The company has purposely underpriced some of its food options to combat inflation, using a barbell method where affordable options like burgers and chicken are paired with premium cuts of beef. The personable wait staff is also well-trained in upselling, recommending toppings and sides for entrees and drinks to pair with different meals. Beverage Innovation is another new company pillar, as younger crowds drift away from alcohol but still want premium, zero-proof drinks. Texas Roadhouse is experimenting with a variety of new non-alcoholic beverages, combining different flavors in non-typical fashions such as salty and sweet (swalty) and sweet and spicy (swicy). Yes, these are real terms. Digital innovation and portfolio diversification are two additional strategic initiatives the company is employing to enhance speed and profitability. More than 200 kitchens are planned for conversion to a Digital Kitchen System, which will reduce the amount of labor required to service a busy restaurant while creating a less stressful environment for staff. More than 60% of these conversions have already been completed, and the company has reported reduced cook times in the restaurants using the system. Texas Roadhouse is also expanding its offerings into different markets with Bubba’s 33, a sports bar focused on wings and burgers, and Jaggers, a traditional fast-casual restaurant to compete directly with established players like Shake Shack, Five Guys, and Raising Cane’s. As of April 2025, the company has opened 50 Bubba’s 33 and 14 Jaggers locations, with 33 more Bubba’s expected in the next 12 months. Bubba’s 33, in particular, has reported exceptional revenue growth, with sales up more than 20% last year. Texas Roadhouse missed earnings expectations during its Q1 2025 release on May 8, posting EPS of $1.70 compared to analyst projections of $1.75. However, a closer look under the hood reveals why this figure could be misleading. The company’s underpricing plan to attract fast-casual diners has resulted in a deliberate but temporary reduction in profit. However, revenue growth remains strong, and EPS numbers are expected to rebound as inflation continues to moderate. The company’s Q1 2025 revenue of $1.45 billion slightly surpassed the expected $1.44 billion, but the figure represented year-over-year (YOY) growth of nearly 12% during a time period when consumers were cautious and pulling back from discretionary spending. Same-store sales were up 3.5% for the quarter, and all three of the company’s brands reported all-time high sales weeks during the period. Rising beef prices will weigh on the company’s performance moving forward, but that hasn’t stopped analysts from Truist Financial and Guggenheim from boosting their price targets this month, to $212 and $210, respectively. Both these updated targets indicate upside of more than 11% from current levels. The company’s Q2 report is scheduled for July 24. The TXRH daily stock chart also shows some bullish momentum, and if history is any guide, this could precede an outsized gain. At the end of September 2023, the 50-day moving average dipped under the 200-day moving average, and shares declined to a multi-year low. Investors didn’t need to stress for long, though; a Golden Cross formed shortly before the calendar flipped, and 2024 proved to be a banner year for the stock.  And now, what do we have here—a brief decline that caused the 50-day moving average to dip below the 200-day, followed by a quick rebound where a Golden Cross formed. Even though TXRH shares haven’t made a new all-time high since last November, bullish momentum is beginning to boil, and the stock has been tap-dancing on the 50-day MA for more than a month. If the company’s growth initiatives continue to produce results, Texas Roadhouse should remain a compelling investment. Before you consider Texas Roadhouse, you'll want to hear this.

US ice cream makers say they'll stop using artificial dyes by 2028,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/us-ice-cream-makers-say-theyll-stop-using-artificial-dyes-by-2028-2025-07-14/,"Ice cream makers representing about 90% of the U.S. supply of the frozen treat have pledged to remove artificial dyes from their products in less than three years, federal health officials said Monday. The move is the latest voluntary effort by food manufacturers to heed calls from the Trump administration to remove synthetic dyes over concerns about potential health effects. In recent weeks, companies including Nestle, Kraft Heinz and General Mills said they would pull artificial colors from their foods, too. “This is a Renaissance moment for health in America,"" U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference. About 40 makers of ice cream and frozen dairy desserts said they would remove seven petroleum-based dyes from their products by 2028, according to Michael Dykes, president of the International Dairy Foods Association. The colors are Red 3, Red 40, Green 3, Blue 1, Blue 2, Yellow 5 and Yellow 6. The trade group wouldn't identify the firms, although Turkey Hill Dairy chief executive Andy Jacobs joined the gathering. The national focus on artificial food dyes is “a good step to take,"" but officials should not ignore larger known contributors to chronic disease, including the added sugars and saturated fat commonly found in ice cream, said Deanna Hoelscher, a University of Texas nutrition expert. “Just taking out or changing the food dye source is not necessarily going to make it a healthy option,” she said. “It still is a food that should be consumed in moderation.” However, Makary also hinted that new federal dietary guidelines, expected later this year, would challenge established links between saturated fat and heart disease, ending what he called “a 70-year demonization of natural saturated fat.” The average American eats about 4 gallons of ice cream a year, the IDFA said. Health advocates have long called for the removal of artificial dyes from foods, citing mixed studies showing that they may cause some neurobehavioral problems, such as hyperactivity and attention problems, in some children. The Food and Drug Administration has maintained that approved dyes are safe and that “most children have no adverse effects” when consuming foods made with them. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has criticized the dyes and pressured manufacturers to remove them from foods. In their place, manufacturers should use dyes made from fruit juices, plant extracts and other sources, federal officials said. The FDA has approved new natural color additives in recent months, including a new blue color made from the fruit of the gardenia announced Monday. Gardenia (genipin) blue is approved for use in sports drinks, candies and certain other products, the agency said. Makary also sent a letter to food manufacturers on Monday that “encourages” them to speed up removal of the dye known as Red 3, which was banned in January. Food makers have until 2027 to remove the dye, which was found to cause cancer in laboratory rats, but not humans. Some food companies have said they will stop using artificial dyes, but relying on voluntary action rather than regulatory requirements won't guarantee compliance, said Thomas Galligan, a scientist with the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer advocacy group. “Talk is cheap,” Galligan said. “It's easy for companies to make promises to look like they're being compliant and generate goodwill among consumers and the Trump administration, but it remains to be seen if they will actually follow through.” ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Senate Democrats say Trump's policies are hurting America’s ability to compete with China,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/senate-democrats-say-trumps-policies-are-hurting-americas-ability-to-compete-with-china-2025-07-14/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's foreign aid cuts, tariffs on allies and restrictions on international students have “deeply” undermined America's ability to compete with China, Senate Democrats say. In a report released Monday, Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee called for congressional action toward restoring the country's global reputation and influence to ensure the U.S. will not be unseated by China as the world's leading power. “America’s retreat from the world will have real and lasting consequences for the American people,” the report says. ""And a retreat from the system that we helped build following the Second World War — based on democracy, economic interdependence and American values — means China is increasingly able to set the global agenda at the expense of U.S. interests.” The report comes about six months after Trump returned to the White House and began taking drastic measures that his administration says will improve government efficiency and protect U.S. interests, triggering condemnation from Democrats that the moves could amount to ceding global influence to China. White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said the U.S. is strong again under Trump and that his foreign policy is effective “because of his willingness to look anyone in the eye to get better deals for the American people."" “His strategy is paying off, as evidenced by the recent trade deal that created a path towards open market access for Americans and China’s actions to control the spread of deadly fentanyl,” she said. In the report, the Democrats criticized the Trump administration's gutting of the U.S. Agency for International Development, which was a key way of distributing foreign assistance, and the U.S. Agency for Global Media — both tools to extend U.S. soft power and counter Beijing's influence. While Trump's cuts to USAGM, whose outlets deliver uncensored information to parts of the world under authoritarian rule and often without a free press of their own, has resulted in the loss of 54 frequencies by Radio Free Asia and millions of users. Chinese state-run media outlets have added 80 new radio frequencies and multiple languages to their programming, the report said. The administration's cuts to foreign aid programs also has allowed China to surpass the U.S. as the largest bilateral assistance partner for more than 40 countries, according to the report. “China is building influence, expanding relationships and reshaping the global order to its advantage,” said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. In a call with reporters, Shaheen said some Republicans, while unwilling to join the Democrats in the report, share the same concerns over the threat posed by Beijing. The office of committee Chairman Jim Risch, R-Idaho, declined to comment. The report criticized Trump's tariffs on allies and partners including the European Union, Mexico, Canada and Japan. “Blanket tariffs are not just wreaking economic havoc at home, they are also eroding longstanding U.S. alliances, including making it even more difficult to increase defense spending to 5%"" of gross domestic product, the report said. That's the new goal agreed to by NATO allies. The administration's proposals to cut funding for scientific research and crack down on top U.S. universities and foreign students could lead to a brain drain, the report warned, noting China is jumping at the opportunity to lure talent.

Book Review: ‘Algospeak’ shows just how much social media is changing us,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/book-review-algospeak-shows-just-how-much-social-media-is-changing-us-2025-07-14/,"How much has social media changed the way we talk and behave? That’s the question linguist and content creator Adam Aleksic sets out to answer in his debut book “Algospeak.” If you already know what words like “yeet,” “rizz,” “brainrot” or “blackpilled” mean, some of this information might not come as a surprise to you. Still, Aleksic’s analysis reaffirms how this language came about and why it continues to proliferate. For those unfamiliar, it acts as an accessible entry point into social media slang and its evolution. “Algospeak” touches on a wide array of topics, including in-groups and out-groups, censorship, language appropriation, extremism online, microtrends, clickbait and generational divides. The chapters build on each other with a textbook-level attention to vocabulary. This book serves as a sobering reality check on how social media is affecting not just our speech, but our entire identities. “Social media creates new identities in order to commodify them,” Aleksic writes in a chapter about microtrends and micro-labels. “Your decisions are now curated for you under the guise of personalization, while in reality they’re engineered to make platforms as much money as possible.” As a self-proclaimed “etymology nerd,” Aleksic leans heavily into his experience as a content creator, providing a crash course into social media history and how to game the ever-changing and opaque “algorithm.” His tone is academic, yet approachable, and he’s bold but pragmatic in his assertions, exploring counterarguments sufficiently. He identifies the transient nature of language and the algorithm immediately, since the cultural references in “Algospeak” risk expiring quickly as trends change and social media platforms shift — but that’s the point. “‘The algorithm’ is here to stay. This is why I think it’s absolutely worth talking about even the most fleeting words,” Aleksic writes. Aleksic’s writing feels personable and knowledgeable as he translates his online presence offline, and in doing so, demonstrates his own claims about parasocial relationships and owning one’s audience. Keeping up with the algorithmic cycle is portrayed as exhausting, but as a necessary evil for influencers supporting their livelihoods through social media. ""Algospeak"" is a fascinating blend of etymology, psychology, cultural analysis and first-person perspective. The book acts as both a snapshot of our current, social media-imbued society and as an intellectual foundation for language developments to come. Aleksic leaves his reader with questions about the threats and opportunities that stem from social media developments, but undeniably one principle is true: social media has breached containment and is influencing not only the way we talk, but the way we live. “Algorithms are the culprits, influencers are the accomplices, language is the weapon, and you, dear reader, are the victim,” he writes. ___ AP book reviews: https://apnews.com/hub/book-reviews Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

Best Prime Day Ever? Here Are the Prime Winners Riding the Wave,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/best-prime-day-ever-here-are-the-prime-winners-riding-the-wave/,"Data from Amazon NASDAQ: AMZN and Adobe NASDAQ: ADBE reveal that this year’s Prime Day event was the largest on record, driving a nearly 30% increase in online sales across the retail sector. Originally a limited event isolated to Amazon, Prime Day now spans four days and is compounded by sales events at other retailers, who also benefit from the boost. Names like Walmart NYSE: WMT, Target NYSE: TGT, Best Buy NYSE: BBY, and Kohl’s NYSE: KSS are stand-outs that also offered deals, and winners exist across the retail industry.  Among the details released by Adobe are that Americans made more than one trillion visits to U.S. websites hosting over 100 million stock-keeping units (SKUs) in 18 categories. In many cases, consumers were shopping up, choosing higher-quality and higher-ticket items in greater quantities; total traffic and sales amounted to more than two Black Fridays. This makes the Internet and e-Commerce infrastructure companies likely beneficiaries, and Visa is the leading choice. Visa NYSE: V is accepted by roughly 97% of U.S. e-commerce merchants, making it the number one choice for transactions nationwide. Other payment processors exist, including PayPal, which is also a likely beneficiary. Regarding Visa, the bar is set high for Q2, with analysts lifting targets during the quarter; however, outperformance is likely, and the guidance will be favorable due to consumer trends and the Prime Day event. PayPal NASDAQ: PYPL faces competition in 2025 but is well-positioned with roughly 45% of the e-commerce market share, accepted by roughly 36% of digital merchants. It is expected to grow in 2025 at a low-single-digit pace driven by active user growth and deepening penetration of services. Other drivers include Venmo, which allows for easy, seamless, peer-to-peer and merchant transactions. As of mid-July, the consensus expects a bigger upside for PayPal's stock price, although the trend appears more bullish for Visa. While PayPal is forecasted to rise by 18% at the consensus, its analysts' sentiment cooled in H1, while Visa’s warmed. Visa analyst trends include increased coverage, firming sentiment, and a rising price target with 15% upside forecast at the high-end range.  Shopify NYSE: SHOP isn’t just a website builder for e-commerce solutions. It is an end-to-end solution for e-commerce that scales with business growth, facilitating cross-border transactions, and serves as a gateway to accelerated growth. Trends in 2025 include a lean into AI-facilitated operations and services, sustained high-double-digit growth, and outperformance. Business drivers include increased client counts, deepening penetration, and volume gains in the low-20% range. Regarding market share, Shopify commands roughly one-third of U.S. sales and is growing. Analysts trimmed their price targets for Shopify earlier in the year, capping gains for the market. However, the 43 tracked by MarketBeat provide a solid support base for this stock and view it as fairly valued near mid-July price points. Another quarter of strong results will reinvigorate the group, and a strong quarter is likely. As it stands, the consensus is for revenue growth to slow to only 24% in Q2. Outperformance is expected because of the revision trend, as most analysts have lowered their estimates over the past three months and due to the strength of e-commerce sales. Walmart will lead the retail sector for growth in Q2 and provide solid guidance. The addition of strong Prime Day sales bolsters the outlook and increases the expectations, which are already solid. Analysts are forecasting $174 billion in net revenue, sufficient for a sequential and YOY acceleration and substantial margin, with strengths in its in-store, digital, and membership club channels. Retailers like Target and Kohl’s will likely lose market share to their larger competitors; off-price names like TJX Companies NYSE: TJX, which are working to improve digital sales, are also well-positioned for growth in 2025.

"Starbucks takes aim at remote work, says some employees may need to relocate to headquarters",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/starbucks-takes-aim-at-remote-work-says-some-employees-may-need-to-relocate-to-headquarters-2025-07-14/,"Starbucks is requiring some remote workers to return to its headquarters and increasing the number of days that corporate employees are required to work in an office. In a letter to employees posted on Monday, Starbucks Chairman and CEO Brian Niccol said corporate employees would need to be in the office four days a week starting in early October instead of three days a week. The Seattle-based company said that all corporate “people leaders” must be based in either Seattle or Toronto within 12 months. That is a change from February, when it required vice presidents to relocate to Seattle or Toronto. Starbucks said individual employees working under those leaders would not be asked to relocate. But the company said all hiring for future roles and lateral moves will require employees to be based in Seattle or Toronto. “We are reestablishing our in-office culture because we do our best work when we’re together. We share ideas more effectively, creatively solve hard problems, and move much faster,” Niccol wrote in the letter. Niccol said affected workers who choose not to relocate will be eligible for a one-time voluntary exit program with a cash payment. While many workers grew to enjoy working from home during the pandemic, the call for workers to return to offices full-time has been growing over the past year. Major employers such as Amazon, AT&T and the federal government have required employees to work in company sites five days per week. Competition for fully-remote jobs is fierce. Starbucks spokeswoman Lori Torgerson said she didn't have a count of employees who are currently working as “people leaders” or are working remotely. Starbucks has 16,000 corporate support employees worldwide, but that includes coffee roasters and warehouse staff. Niccol was not required to relocate to Seattle when he was hired to lead Starbucks last August. Instead, the company said it would help him set up an office near his home in Newport Beach, California, and would give him the use of a corporate jet to commute to Seattle. Since then, Niccol has bought a home in Seattle and is frequently seen at the company's headquarters, Torgerson said. ___ AP Business Writer Cathy Bussewitz contributed from New York.

MP Materials Stock Booms on New Government Positioning,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/mp-materials-stock-booms-on-new-government-positioning/,"Shares of MP Materials Corp. NYSE: MP took the entire market by surprise in the second week of July 2025, as the stock unexpectedly jumped by as much as 44.7% in that short period. While this could trigger most investors to look the other way, feeling that they have missed the boat and would likely land on the wrong side of a trade if they chase after the tock higher, the truth is that there are other factors still at play that can lead MP Materials stock into a higher level. One of these factors is what is happening in the broader economic spectrum, especially when it comes to where trade tariff negotiations are headed within the United States' rare earth metals industry. When comparing the performance of the S&P 500 index against the Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund NYSEARCA: XLB to represent the basic materials sector, investors will quickly find out where the market preference is today. As basic materials outperformed the overall stock market, this signals investors to dig a little deeper to determine whether MP Materials can continue to lead this broader outperformance. This task is easier said than done. However, there are still very powerful gauges investors can look into for answers. This is why MP Materials stock is likely not done running higher. As a rare earth metals negotiation between the United States and China still develops, it has become clear that the American government needs to start protecting its intellectual property and national interests. One way to do this is to literally take control of the private companies heavily exposed to these materials. This is where MP Materials, the nation’s largest rare earth miner and supplier, comes into play. The United States Pentagon has now become the company’s largest shareholder as it acquired up to $400 million of preferred stock in MP Materials, and there’s an even deeper reason for that. Rare earth metals are crucial components in the defense industry, particularly in military weapons development, making it logical for the Pentagon to intervene and take control of its largest supplier during a period when these materials are at risk of being overwhelmed by overseas interests. The question now becomes whether MP Materials is done with its path higher after a near 50% rally, and that is where the subtle market gauges come into play for investors to analyze further and justify these themes moving forward. As soon as this acquisition announcement made headlines, Canaccord Genuity Group analyst George Gianarikas decided to reiterate his Buy rating on MP Materials stock; however, his price target really took everyone by surprise, especially compared to where he saw the company valued previously. Compared to his previous $27 per share target, today’s $55 valuation is more than double, the sort of jump that investors rarely come by when it comes to Wall Street analyst ratings, and one to pay attention to. Relative to where the stock trades today, this valuation could be the trigger for further bullish developments in the coming months. A $55 target calls for a new 52-week high to be made in MP Materials stock and an additional 22% upside potential even after a near 50% rally. When the stock breaks its 52-week high prices, a lot more institutional investors (focused on momentum) will likely come in and provide additional buying pressure for MP to keep going higher. In fact, the broader market agrees with this view. On a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, MP Materials is set to command one of the largest premiums in the space, especially as the company could report steady profitability in the coming quarters if the United States government plans to roll out new contracts. Whenever markets are willing to pay this much for a company whose earnings per share (EPS) have yet to stand the test of time, investors should get looking, since there is often a very good reason for this premium, one that typically brings about higher prices. With this in mind, investors can reiterate the optimistic view of where MP Materials stock’s short interest stands today: a high 25.8% of the total share float. Considering how aggressively the stock has gone up and how much further it can go, this could set up a classic short squeeze scenario. This is exactly what created the meme stock mania of the early 2020s. This event forces short sellers to close their positions at a loss (which involves buying the stock). Since MP Materials’ short interest is as high as $1 billion, wiping out these short sellers could send the stock to its current price target, if not even higher.
