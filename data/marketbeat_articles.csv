"Asian shares are mixed after Nvidia nudges Nasdaq to a record, while other US stocks slump",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/asian-shares-are-mixed-after-nvidia-nudges-nasdaq-to-a-record-while-other-us-stocks-slump-2025-07-16/,"BANGKOK (AP) — Shares in Asia traded mixed on Wednesday after an update on inflation pulled most U.S. stocks lower, though gains for Nvidia pushed the Nasdaq to another record. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 gained 0.6% to 39,895.84 as the U.S. dollar rose against the Japanese yen, trading near 149 yen. Investors are focused on the potential impact of an election for the Upper House of Parliament on Sunday that is expected to lead to tax cuts and higher spending as lawmakers try to restore the waning popularity of the ruling Liberal Democrats. Worries over a deterioration in Japan's fiscal health have pushed yields of long-term Japanese government bonds to their highest levels in years. “What’s at stake isn’t simply which party hands out the biggest bundle of goodies. It’s whether the walls holding up Japan’s house of debt can withstand another round of fiscal fireworks…” Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. Elsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.3% to 24,658.55 while the Shanghai Composite index slipped 0.1% to 3,500.62. South Korea's Kospi lost 0.7% to 3,192.97 and in Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 declined 0.8% to 8,558.10. Taiwan's Taiex jumped 0.8% and India's Sensex gave up 0.1%. Thailand's SET was little changed. In Jakarta, shares rose 0.7% after President Donald Trump said on Truth Social that he plans to tariff imports from Indonesia at 19%, while American goods sent to the Southeast Asian country will face no tariffs. Trump also said Indonesia committed to buying U.S. energy, agricultural products and aircraft. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 fell 0.4% to 6,243.76, but stayed near its all-time high set last week, as 90% of the stocks within the index fell. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1% to 44,023.29. The Nasdaq composite rose 0.2% to a record 20,677.80 thanks to Nvidia, the market’s most influential stock. Nvidia said the U.S. government has assured it that licenses will be granted  for its H20 chip, used for artificial intelligence, again and that deliveries will hopefully begin soon. Its 4% gain was by far the strongest force pushing upward on the S&P 500. Stocks of big U.S. banks were mixed following their latest profit reports. JPMorgan Chase slipped 0.7% despite reporting a stronger profit than analysts expected, as CEO Jamie Dimon warned of risks to the economy  because of tariffs and other concerns. Citigroup rose 3.7% following its better-than-expected profit report. But Wells Fargo fell 5.5% following its own, as it trimmed its forecast for an important way that it makes money. A report showed inflation in the United States accelerated to 2.7% last month from 2.4% in May as prices rose for clothes, toys and other goods that usually are imported. Economists say prices may be rising because of stiff tariffs that President Donald Trump has proposed  on other countries. Treasury yields yo-yoed after the report and then began rising. The yield on the 10-year Treasury climbed to 4.48% from 4.43% late Monday. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which more closely tracks expectations for what the Federal Reserve will do with short-term interest rates, rose to 3.95% from 3.90%. Higher inflation could inhibit interest rate cuts by the Fed. It has been keeping rates on hold this year after cutting them at the end of last year. That’s because lower rates can give inflation more fuel, along with a boost for the economy. Wall Street loves lower rates because they goose prices higher for stocks and other investments, and Trump himself has been clamoring  for the Fed to cut more quickly. Fed Chair Jerome Powell, though, has been adamant  that he wants to wait for more data about how tariffs affect the economy and inflation. Following Tuesday’s inflation report, traders are still overwhelmingly betting that the Fed will cut its main interest rate by the end of the year. But they pulled back their bets on the number of potential cuts, according to data from CME Group. In other dealings early Wednesday, U.S. benchmark crude oil picked up 26 cents to $66.78 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, was up 15 cents at $68.86 per barrel. The dollar rose to 148.94 Japanese yen from 148.87 yen.

How Trump could use a building renovation to oust the Fed chair,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/how-trump-could-use-a-building-renovation-to-oust-the-fed-chair-2025-07-15/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump says he has finally found a way to achieve his goal of removing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, accusing him of mismanaging the U.S. central bank’s $2.5 billion renovation project. The push comes after a monthslong campaign by Trump to try to rid himself of the politically independent central banker, who has resisted the president's calls to slash interest rates out of concerns about the administration's tariffs sparking higher levels of inflation. The president indicated Tuesday that Powell’s handling of an extensive renovation project on two Fed buildings in Washington could be grounds to take the unprecedented and possibly legally dubious step of firing him. “I think it sort of is,” Trump said. “When you spend $2.5 billion on, really, a renovation, I think it’s really disgraceful,” Trump said, adding that he never saw the Fed chair as someone who needed a “palace.” The project has been underway for years, going back to Trump’s first term. But it only recently caught the White House’s attention. Trump maintains that Fed rate cuts would lower the costs of government borrowing, while Powell has warned that a premature rate cut could worsen inflation and ultimately raise those borrowing costs. The risk of the Fed losing its political independence could undermine America’s financial markets, possibly leading to a meltdown in stocks and investors charging a premium to lend to the U.S. economy. Here’s what to know: The Fed chair has been an obstacle in Trump's efforts to gain total control over the executive branch. Powell and his board have the dual mandate of maximizing employment and keeping prices stable, a task that can require them to make politically unpopular moves such as raising interest rates to hold inflation in check. The general theory is that keeping the Fed free from the influence of the White House — other than for nominations of Fed officials — allows it to fulfill its mission based on what the economy needs, instead of what a politician wants. An attempt to remove Powell from his job before his term ends in May 2026 would undercut the Fed’s long-standing independence from day-to-day politics and could lead to higher inflation, higher interest rates and a weaker economy. The Supreme Court recently signaled that the president can’t fire Powell simply because Trump disagrees with him on interest rates. But legally he could do so “for cause,” such as misconduct or dereliction of duty. Trump's workaround appears to be that Powell misrepresented the renovation project in congressional testimony and that the cost is excessive, thus meriting his dismissal. The Fed says its main headquarters, known as the Marriner S. Eccles building, was in dire need of an upgrade because its electrical, plumbing and HVAC systems, among others, are nearly obsolete and some date back to the building's construction in the 1930s. The renovation will also remove asbestos, lead and other hazardous elements and update the building with modern electrical and communications systems. The H-shaped building, named after a former Fed chair in the 1930s and ‘40s, is located near some of Washington’s highest-profile monuments and has references to classical architecture and marble in the facades and stonework. The central bank is also renovating a building next door that it acquired in 2018. The Fed says there has been periodic maintenance to the structures but adds that this is the first “comprehensive renovation.” Trump administration officials have criticized the Fed over the project's expense, which has reached $2.5 billion, about $600 million more than was originally budgeted. Like a beleaguered homeowner facing spiraling costs for a remodeling project, the Fed cites many reasons for the greater expense. Construction costs, including for materials and labor, rose sharply during the inflation spike in 2021 and 2022. More asbestos needed to be removed than expected. Washington's local restrictions on building heights forced it to build underground, which is pricier. In 2024, the Fed's board canceled its planned renovations of a third building because of rising costs. The Fed says the renovations will reduce costs “over time” because it will be able to consolidate its roughly 3,000 Washington-based employees into fewer buildings and will no longer need to rent as much extra space as it does now. Russ Vought, the administration's top budget adviser, wrote Powell a letter last Thursday that said Trump is “extremely troubled” about the Fed's “ostentatious overhaul” of its facilities. The Fed's renovation plans call for “rooftop terrace gardens, VIP private dining rooms and elevators, water features, premium marble, and much more,"" Vought said in his letter. Powell has disputed the claims, which were given wide circulation in a paper issued by the Mercatus Center, a think tank at George Mason University, in March 2025. The paper was written by Andrew Levin, an economist at Dartmouth College and former Fed staffer. “There’s no VIP dining room,"" Powell said last month during a Senate Banking Committee hearing. “There’s no new marble. ... There are no special elevators. There are no new water features. ... And there's no roof terrace gardens.” Some of those elements were removed from initial building plans submitted in 2021, the Fed says. The Fed's changes to its building plans have opened it up to another line of attack: White House officials suggest the Fed violated the terms of the approval it received from a local planning commission by changing its plans. In its September 2021 approval of the project, the National Capital Planning Commission said it “Commends” the Fed for “fully engaging partner federal agencies.” But because the Fed changed its plans, the administration is indicating it needed to go back to the commission for a separate approval. Essentially, White House officials are saying Powell is being reckless with taxpayer money because of the cost of the renovation, but they are also accusing him of acting unethically by scaling back the project to save money. James Blair, the White House deputy chief of staff whom Trump named to the commission, said last Thursday in a post on X that Powell’s June congressional testimony ""leads me to conclude the project is not in alignment with plans submitted to & approved by the National Capital Planning Commission in 2021.” Speaking last Thursday at the planning commission meeting, Blair said he intends to tour the construction site, review materials from the Fed on how the approved 2021 renovation plans have changed and circulate a letter among his colleagues on the commission that would go to Fed officials. The central bank says, in a series of frequently asked questions on its website, that it is ""not subject to the direction” of the commission and has only complied with its directives voluntarily. Instead, the Fed said it is accountable to the Senate and House of Representatives, and is also overseen by an independent inspector general, not the White House. Powell has asked the inspector general to review the costs of the renovation project. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

Rough times for broadcast networks illustrate changing media landscape,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/rough-times-for-broadcast-networks-illustrate-changing-media-landscape-2025-07-15/,"NEW YORK (AP) — Two milestones revealed this week illustrate the diminishing power of broadcast television in the media world — one fueled by the habits of young people and the other by their elders. During June, viewers spent more time watching streaming services than they did for broadcast and cable television combined. That happened for the first time ever in May, by a fraction of a percentage point, but the Nielsen company said on Tuesday that gap widened considerably in June. Also, for the third straight week, Nielsen said that Fox News Channel had more viewers in prime-time on weeknights than any of the main the broadcast networks ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox entertainment. For years, the mantra of media executives was that streaming represented the future for in-home entertainment. Now, that future has clearly arrived. In June, 46% of Americans' TV time was spent on streaming services, led by YouTube and Netflix. Cable television networks represented 23.4% and broadcast was 18.5%, for a total of just under 42%, Nielsen said. It was the first time broadcast TV had ever slipped below 20% of total TV viewing. “It kind of felt like the right time,” said Brian Fuhrer, Nielsen's senior vice president for product strategy and thought leadership. “A lot of people thought it would happen more quickly.” The driving force in June was school ending for young people, meaning they had more time to watch TV, where Netflix series like “Ginny & Georgia” and “Squid Game” were big hits. Roughly two-thirds of people aged 6 to 17 watched streaming ahead of conventional TV, Nielsen said. In June 2024, the numbers were roughly reversed — 47.7% of people were watching conventional TV in an average minute, with 40.3% logged on to a streaming service. While the direction is clear, it's not a death knell for conventional TV. June and July are fallow months, and their viewing will increase when football season begins and original episodes of comedies and dramas return, Fuhrer said. It's also not a strict either-or situation; media companies are doing a better job spreading their content out on different platforms to give viewers a choice, he said. The growth of YouTube, which many consumers can access for free and is a portal for ""traditional"" TV, has also fueled streaming services. Fox News has occasionally eclipsed the broadcast networks in viewership before, but last week represented the seventh week it has done so in 2025, already more than 2024 and 2023 combined. It averaged 2.4 million viewers in prime time on weeknights last week, Nielsen said. Fox News is also taking advantage of what is traditionally the least-watched time of the year for broadcast networks, when summer nights and barbecues keep people outside. The difference this year is it has won a few weeks outside of the summer, during President Donald Trump's inauguration week in January, for example. Its audience — among the oldest of all television networks — tends to stay pretty steady throughout the year. ___ David Bauder writes about the intersection of media and entertainment for the AP.

Republicans declared it 'crypto' week in the House. It's not going as planned,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/republicans-declared-it-crypto-week-in-the-house-its-not-going-as-planned-2025-07-15/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A trio of cryptocurrency bills that had been expected to pass the House this week stalled Tuesday after a bloc of Republicans unexpectedly joined with Democrats to prevent the legislation from coming up for debate and votes. The procedural snafu brought the House’s so-called “crypto week” to a standstill — and dealt a blow to President Donald Trump, who had strongly urged Republicans to pass the bills as part of his push to make the U.S. the “ crypto capital of the world.” Trump intervened during a late evening meeting with Republicans at the White House, and appeared to put the bills back on track. He posted on social media that he expected votes as soon as Wednesday. A group of 13 Republicans had joined all Democrats in opposition to a procedural vote needed to bring the crypto bills to the floor. Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters it was just part of the “legislative process” and that negotiations were underway between the House, Senate and White House. He suggested they could try again Tuesday evening. “We expected there might be some ‘no’ votes, but we thought it was important to put it on the floor to advance it because time’s of the essence on this,” Johnson said. “So stay tuned. We’ll have lots of discussions over the next few hours.” But just hours later, House leadership canceled votes for the remainder of the day, potentially throwing the crypto bills into limbo. Then, late in the evening, Trump posted that he was having a White House meeting with lawmakers and had won their support to vote for the procedural step. “I am in the Oval Office with 11 of the 12 Congressmen/women necessary to pass the GENIUS Act and, after a short discussion, they have all agreed to vote tomorrow morning in favor of the Rule,” Trump said on social media, referring to the step. The president said that Johnson attended via telephone “and looks forward to taking the Vote as early as possible.” The stalled legislation includes a Senate-passed bill to regulate a form of cryptocurrency known as stablecoins, along with far more sweeping measures aiming to address cryptocurrency market structure. Another bill would prohibit the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency. The disagreement blocking the bills from advancing centers on how the three bills would be passed. Johnson explained that “some of these guys insist that it needs to be all in one package.” Packaging the bills would require them to be sent back to the Senate, since the chamber has only taken up one of the three bills so far. Rep. Glenn Thompson of Pennsylvania, a Republican co-sponsor of one of the cryptocurrency bills, told reporters that some of the Republicans wanted to package the bills together due to them “not having a lot of faith in the Senate moving our legislation.” Trump and Republican leaders have called on the House to pass the bills individually, so that the stablecoin legislation can get to Trump's desk for his signature before an August recess. The stablecoin legislation took the Senate nearly a month and half to pass, and the more sweeping market structure legislation is expected to take even longer. In a post Tuesday morning on social media, Trump had called on Republicans to advance the crypto bills that afternoon, saying that “all Republicans should vote ‘yes.’” Asked Tuesday evening about the stalled legislation, Trump told reporters that Republicans who voted against it wanted it to be “stronger.” Trump has pushed hard for the passage of the stablecoin legislation, with him and his family standing to profit from a boost to stablecoins. They hold a significant stake in World Liberty Financial, a crypto project that recently launched its own stablecoin, USD1. The stablecoin legislation passed by the Senate includes a provision that bars members of Congress and their families from profiting off stablecoins. But notably, that prohibition does not apply to the president or his family, even as Trump builds what some are calling a crypto empire from the White House. The cryptocurrency industry hopes the bills as a whole will aid in their push for legitimacy and increasing consumer trust. And road bumps like those seen Tuesday may not have been expected after spending heavily in the 2024 election to elect a large number of crypto-friendly lawmakers. Faryar Shirzad, chief policy officer of Coinbase, the nation's largest cryptocurrency exchange, said in a statement after the failed procedural vote that “every few steps forward there’s inevitably a step back.” “It’s in these moments we’ll see who is trying to get pro-crypto legislation done and who is not,” Shirzad said on social media. Passage of the bills could have implications on the 2026 midterm races. Fairshake, a crypto super political action committee, said that it and its affiliated organizations already have more than $140 million in the bank ready to spend on midterm races. “The voters last year were clear — Congress needs to stop playing politics with crypto and finally pass responsible regulation,” said Josh Vlasto, spokesperson for Fairshake. “We are building an aggressive, targeted strategy for next year to ensure that pro-crypto voices are heard in key races across the country.” ___ Associated Press writer Lisa Mascaro contributed to this report.

"Trump to put tariffs of over 10% on smaller nations, including those in Africa and the Caribbean",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-to-put-tariffs-of-over-10-on-smaller-nations-including-those-in-africa-and-the-caribbean-2025-07-15/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump told reporters Tuesday that he plans to place tariffs of over 10% on smaller countries, including nations in Africa and the Caribbean. “We’ll probably set one tariff for all of them,” Trump said, adding that it could be “a little over 10% tariff” on goods from at least 100 nations. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick interjected that the nations with goods being taxed at these rates would be in Africa and the Caribbean, places that generally do relatively modest levels of trade with the U.S. and would be relatively insignificant for addressing Trump's goals of reducing trade imbalances with the rest of the world. The president had this month been posting letters to roughly two dozen countries and the European Union that simply levied a tariff rate to be charged starting Aug. 1. Those countries generally faced tax rates on the goods close to the April 2 rates announced by the U.S. president, whose rollout of historically high import taxes for the U.S. caused financial markets to panic and led to Trump setting a 90-day negotiating period that expired July 9. Trump also said he would “probably” announce tariffs on pharmaceutical drugs at the “end of the month.” The president said he would start out at a lower tariff rate and give companies a year to build domestic factories before they faced higher import tax rates. Trump said computer chips would face a similar style of tariffs. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

Cuban labor minister resigns after her suggestion beggars were pretending sparked backlash,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/cuban-minister-faces-backlash-for-saying-there-are-no-beggars-in-cuba-2025-07-15/,"HAVANA (AP) — A Cuban minister who sparked criticism after saying that there are no beggars in Cuba, only people disguised as such, resigned Tuesday. Cuba's Presidency said in a post on X that Minister of Labor and Social Security Marta Elena Feitó Cabrera “acknowledged her errors and submitted her resignation.” Feitó made the comments Monday before deputies in a National Assembly committee. The comments went viral, prompting calls for Feitó's impeachment and a wave of criticism in a country experiencing a tough economic situation in recent years. Even Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel was critical. Without mentioning her by name, but referring to the meeting at the National Assembly committee where Feitó participated, Díaz-Canel said on his X account: “the lack of sensitivity in addressing vulnerability is highly questionable. The revolution cannot leave anyone behind; that is our motto, our militant responsibility.” The economic crisis in Cuba has increased social vulnerability and led to unusual scenes for the island, such as people — especially the elderly — begging or scavenging through garbage, or some cleaning windshields at corners. “We have seen people, apparently beggars, (but) when you look at their hands, look at the clothes these people are wearing, they are disguised as beggars, they are not beggars,"" Feitó said before the National Assembly committee. ""In Cuba there are no beggars.” She added that people cleaning windshields use the money to “drink alcohol.” Feitó also lashed out against those who search through the garbage dumps, saying they are recovering materials “to resell and not pay tax.” Until a few years ago, despite the poverty, there were no signs of begging or homelessness on the island thanks to benefits that have now been greatly reduced. The pension of a retiree is about 2,000 Cuban pesos per month, roughly $5 on the informal market, and just under the cost of a carton of eggs. For those who don’t receive remittances from family abroad, it means going hungry. Self-employed Enrique Guillén believes the minister is wrong and that some people do not see the situation clearly, and hopes the government will take action. “They are elderly people who count on a pension that does not exist. They cannot even buy a carton of eggs. It is the reality we are living in Cuba,” Guillén said. On Monday, island authorities reported that Cuba's gross domestic product fell by 1.1% in 2024, accumulating a decline of 11% over the past five years.

Google partners with Youngkin and offers AI training courses to Virginia job seekers,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/google-partners-with-youngkin-and-offers-ai-training-courses-to-virginia-job-seekers-2025-07-15/,"RESTON, Va. (AP) — Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin announced on Tuesday that Google will partner with his administration to provide free and low-cost artificial intelligence certification courses to Virginians as part of his office’s ongoing effort to connect citizens to new jobs amid changes to the state’s economy. The partnership, which he has described as an AI career launchpad, will provide Google-sponsored AI training courses for up to 10,000 Virginians at any given time, officials said at Google’s office in the northern part of the state. The training opportunities will be listed on a job website that Youngkin launched earlier this year, in response to significant layoffs among federal workers by the Trump administration, including many workers from Virginia. “All fields, all career movements somewhere along the way, are going to incorporate this next generation of technology,” Youngkin said at the news conference. The initiative comes with unemployment rising in Virginia, which has roughly 20,400 continued unemployment claims, state Secretary of Labor George’ Bryan’ Slater said after the news conference. Roughly 2,800 people initially filed unemployment claims during the first week of July, which is about 6.1 percent higher than the previous week. The AI webpage will feature the free courses as well as some low-cost learning opportunities, ranging “from beginner friendly courses on AI fundamentals and practical workplace applications of artificial intelligence to bootcamps and degree programs offered by Virginia’s leading-edge community colleges and universities,” according to the governor’s office. Nicole Overley, commissioner of Virginia Works, said businesses have told her office that AI proficiency has become increasingly necessary in their industries. She said the training would help Virginians become competitive in the job markets where these very businesses are hiring. Overly confirmed that the training courses won't cost taxpayers anything and are being donated by Google. Bronagh Friel, head of partnerships at Google, said she was proud of the collaboration with the state. “Google is committed to championing economic growth and opportunity in Virginia,” she said. ___ Olivia Diaz is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

The email was sent earlier this month to leaders of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission with the subject line “Hot Topics,” in which Thomas Colclough, director of the agency’s Office of Field Programs, announced that if new transgender worker complaints involve “hiring, discharge or promotion, you are clear to continue processing these charges.” But even those cases will still be subject to higher scrutiny than other types of workplace discrimination cases, requiring approval from President Donald Trump's appointed acting agency head Andrea Lucas, who has said that one of her priorities would be “defending the biological and binary reality of sex and related rights.” Since Trump regained office in January, the EEOC has moved away from its prior interpretation of civil rights law, marking a stark contrast to a decade ago when the agency issued a landmark finding that a transgender civilian employee of the U.S. Army had been discriminated against because her employer refused to use her preferred pronouns or allow her to use bathrooms based on her gender identity. Under Lucas's leadership, the EEOC has dropped several lawsuits on behalf of transgender workers. Lucas defended that decision during her June 18 Senate committee confirmation hearing in order to comply with the president’s executive order declaring two unchangeable sexes. However, she acknowledged that a 2020 Supreme Court ruling — Bostock v. Clayton County — “did clearly hold that discriminating against someone on the basis of sex included firing an individual who is transgender or based on their sexual orientation.” Colclough acknowledged in his July 1 email that the EEOC will consider transgender discrimination complaints that “fall squarely under” the Supreme Court’s ruling, such as cases involving hiring, firing and promotion. The email backtracked on an earlier policy, communicated verbally, that de-prioritized all transgender cases. The EEOC declined to comment on the specifics of its latest policy, saying: “Under federal law, charge inquiries and charges of discrimination made to the EEOC are confidential. Pursuant to Title VII and as statutorily required, the EEOC is, has been, and will continue to accept and investigate charges on all bases protected by law, and to serve those charges to the relevant employer."" But even the cases that the EEOC is willing to consider under Bostock must still be reviewed by a senior attorney advisor, and then sent to Lucas for final approval. This heightened review process is not typical for other discrimination charges and reflects the agency’s increased oversight for gender identity cases, former EEOC commissioner Chai Feldblum told The AP in a Monday phone interview. “It is a slight improvement because it will allow certain claims of discrimination to proceed,"" Feldblum said of the new policy. “But overall it does not fix a horrific and legally improper situation currently occurring at the EEOC.” Colclough's email did not clarify how long the review process might take, or whether cases that include additional claims, such as harassment or retaliation, would be eligible to proceed, and the EEOC declined to address those questions. ""This is not the EEOC being clear to either its own staff or to the public what charges are going to be processed,"" Feldblum said. “This is not a panacea."" ________ The Associated Press’ women in the workforce and state government coverage receives financial support from Pivotal Ventures.

"Trump wields tariffs to sway Putin on Ukraine. Here's how they might work, or not",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-wields-tariffs-to-sway-putin-on-ukraine-heres-how-they-might-work-or-not-2025-07-15/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin has sacrificed an estimated 1 million of his soldiers, killed and wounded, in a three-year campaign to crush Ukraine. Now President Donald Trump is betting that his go-to economic weapon — tariffs — can succeed where Ukrainian drones and rockets haven't, and finally persuade Putin to end his war. Tariffs, which the U.S. president has called “ the most beautiful word in the dictionary,’’ are taxes on imports. They are Trump’s all-purpose fix — a tool he deploys to protect American industry, lure factories to the United States, tackle drug trafficking and illegal immigration, and raise money to pay for his massive tax cuts. On the campaign trail last year, Trump promised he'd negotiate an end to the Russia-Ukraine conflict in 24 hours. But months have passed without a peace deal, and the president has recently expressed frustration with the Russians. “We're very, very unhappy with them ... I thought we would have had a deal two months ago, but it doesn't seem to get there,” Trump told reporters Monday. So in addition to agreeing to send more weapons to Ukraine, he's once again unsheathing tariffs. He said Monday the U.S. would impose 100% tariffs on countries that buy Russian oil, natural gas and other products if there isn't a peace deal in 50 days. The levies are meant to cause Russia financial pain by making its trading partners think twice before buying Russian energy. “I use trade for a lot of things,'' Trump said, ""but it’s great for settling wars.” Trump did not spell out exactly how these ""secondary'' tariffs would work, and trade analysts are skeptical. “Unilateral tariffs are likely to be ineffective in influencing Putin’s actions,” said Douglas Irwin, a Dartmouth College economist who studies American trade policy. ""Financial sanctions in cooperation with European and other allies are much more likely to damage Russian economy, but whether they soften Russia’s approach is also uncertain.'' The secondary tariffs idea isn't new. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut earlier this year introduced legislation that would impose a 500% tariff on countries that buy Russian oil, petroleum products and uranium. If Trump goes through with his threat, his 100% tariffs have the potential to disrupt global commerce and push oil prices higher. They might also complicate Trump's efforts to strike separate trade deals with countries like China and India. Since December 2022, when the European Union banned Russian oil, China and India have bought 85% of Russia's crude oil exports and 63% of its coal, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, a Finnish nonprofit. So they would likely be the two countries most affected by Trump's 100% import taxes. Trump has already tangled with China this year, and things did not go well. In April, Trump plastered a 145% levy on Chinese imports, and Beijing counterpunched with 125% tariffs of its own. The triple-digit tariffs threatened to end trade between the world's two biggest economies and briefly sent financial markets reeling. China also withheld shipments of rare earth minerals used in products such as electric vehicles and wind turbines, crippling U.S. businesses. After showing how much pain they could inflict on each other, the United States and China agreed to a ceasefire. A new 100% secondary tariff “would blow up that deal,” said Gary Hufbauer, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “China is particularly well-placed to hold out,” said Nicholas Mulder, a Cornell University historian. ""All this would get us back to a position of full confrontation that would be uncomfortable for all sides.'' Hufbauer also noted that the secondary tariffs would also likely end ”any rapprochement with India'' — the world's fifth-biggest economy and one with which Trump is pursuing a trade deal. If Trump goes ahead with the tariffs, “it would invariably lead to higher global energy prices,’’ especially for natural gas, economists Kieran Tompkins and Liam Peach of Capital Economics wrote in a commentary Monday. Other oil-exporting countries have enough spare capacity to ramp up production and offset any loss of Russian oil exports in global market. But if they did, the world would have no buffer to rely on if there were an oil shock caused by, say, conflict in the Middle East — and prices could skyrocket. “Removing that spare capacity would be akin to riding a bike with no shock absorbers,'' Tompkins and Peach wrote. After Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the United States and its allies slammed Russia with sanctions. Among other things, the U.S. froze the assets of Russia's central bank and barred some Russian banks from using a key international payments system run by Belgium. With its allies from the Group of Seven rich nations, it also capped the price that importers could pay for Russian oil. The sanctions were expected to crush the Russian economy, but they didn't. Putin put Russia on a wartime budget, and high defense spending kept unemployment low. Military recruits were given big sign-up bonuses and the families of the fallen received death benefits, pumping income into some of Russia's poorer regions. To keep its oil sales going, Russia deployed ""shadow fleets,'' hundreds of aging tankers of uncertain ownership and dodgy safety practices that delivered oil priced above the G7 price cap. “The experience of the G7 oil price cap against Russia showed how challenging the enforcement of measures against the Russian oil trade can be,” Mulder said. Last year, the Russian economy grew 4.1%, according to the International Monetary Fund. But strains are showing, partly because Putin's war has made Russia a pariah to foreign investors. The IMF forecasts growth will decelerate to 1.5% this year, and last month the Russian economy minister warned the country is ""on the brink of going into a recession.'' Trump's tariffs could increase the pressure, in part by driving down Russia's energy exports — and the revenue the Russian government collects from an energy tax. “To my knowledge, tariffs have never been applied as an explicit anti-aggression measure,” said Mulder, author of a 2022 history of economic sanctions. ""I am skeptical that the secondary tariffs threat will be effective.'' For one thing, he said, it's unclear whether Trump will actually impose them after 50 days. The president has repeatedly announced tariffs against other countries, and then sometimes suspended or tweaked them. For another, the secondary tariffs would target countries — namely China and India — that might have some sway in Moscow. “The United States needs cooperation and collaboration to bring Russia to the negotiating table,” said Cullen Hendrix, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute. ""Threatening to harm the actors who actually have leverage over Moscow may backfire.'' ____ AP writers Katie Davies in Manchester, England, and Chris Megerian in Washington, contributed to this report.

"JPMorgan Q2 Results Affirm Dividend, Buybacks, & Growth",https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/jpmorgan-q2-results-affirm-dividend-buybacks-and-growth/,"There are many takeaways from JPMorgan Chase & Company’s NYSE: JPM FQ2 report, but the most noteworthy is a seemingly positive turn in CEO Jamie Dimon’s comments. While still highlighting risks, his remarks have turned from concern about dark clouds on the horizon to those citing resilience in the U.S. economy and financial landscape. The takeaway is that risks are present, but the business remains healthy, the outlook is positive, and the potential for economic tailwinds has increased. “The U.S. economy remained resilient in the quarter. The finalization of tax reform and potential deregulation are positive for the economic outlook; however, significant risks persist, including from tariffs and trade uncertainty, worsening geopolitical conditions, high fiscal deficits and elevated asset prices,” said Dimon in his comments. JPMorgan’s stock price outlook was upbeat ahead of the Q2 release and strengthened in its wake. The company reported the expected contraction in YOY revenue, but less than expected, with strengths in critical areas. System-wide, average loans increased by 5%, while deposits rose by 6%. In the community banking segment, where the weaknesses were most pronounced, deposits contracted by a mere 1% and were offset by a double-digit increase in invested assets. Regarding investment income versus non-investment income, the company’s net interest income (NII) increased by 2% but was offset by a 20% decline in fee-based revenue. Margins were also solid. The company’s strong NII aided bottom-line outperformance and $4.96 in adjusted earnings. The adjusted earnings include a $0.28 tax-related benefit but still outpaced the consensus by a solid margin. The net result of segment strength, revenue, and profits is an increase to the guidance, which includes expected strength in top and bottom-line results driven by robust NII, to better-than-forecast levels. NII is likely to remain strong through 2026 due to the favorable interest rate outlook. The FOMC wants to cut rates, but may be unable to do so due to the pace of inflation. The latest CPI reveals that inflation is accelerating at both the headline and core levels compared to the prior month and year, contrary to the outlook for a rate reduction. As of mid-July, the CME FedWatch tool indicates a less than 70% chance of two 25-basis-point rate cuts by the end of the year. JPMorgan’s cash flow and balance sheet reveal built-in credit reserves but are otherwise robust. The build aligns with prior quarters, as do the charge-offs, and the capital ratios are excellent. The tier one ratio is slightly below the consensus forecast but remains well above requirements at 15%. Other critical metrics include the 10% increase in book value, $7 billion in share repurchases, and the board’s decision to increase the dividend for the second time this year. The cumulative increase is worth 20%, a nearly 2% annualized return, and additional increases are expected over time. The buybacks are worth approximately .9% of the market cap and a tailwind for market action. The analyst and institutional trends are positive for this stock. MarketBeat tracked a few price target reductions during Q2, but not many, and they were offset by upgrades and price target increases before the quarter's end. The result is that coverage was firm at 22 analysts when the report was released, sentiment was firming, and the price target was trending higher, indicating a 13% upside relative to the pre-release close that may be achieved before the end of 2025. Institutional activity aligns with the uptrend, with the group owning more than 70% of the stock and buying on balance in 2025.  Before you consider JPMorgan Chase & Co., you'll want to hear this.

Goldman Spotlights These 3 Stocks in Its Bullish S&P 500 Outlook,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/goldman-spotlights-these-3-stocks-in-its-bullish-s-and-p-500-outlook/,"In a recent market update, Goldman Sachs raised its year-end forecast for the S&P 500 (SPX) to 6,900 by year-end, up from a previous ceiling of 6,500, and flagged three stocks investors should have on their radar, including two index stalwarts and one off-the-beaten-path growth opportunity. And Goldman is not alone. Several major investment banks are recalibrating their 2025 S&P 500 (SPX) forecasts at mid-year, reflecting renewed optimism around economic resilience, stabilizing inflation, and the increasing likelihood of a soft landing. Bank of America, for example, also raised its S&P 500 target, lifting its year-end forecast from 5,600 to 6,300, though it struck a more cautious tone. Strategist Savita Subramanian noted that slowing tech earnings and mixed macro data could limit further upside in the near term. Currently, the SPX stands at 6,263 and is up 6.49% year-to-date and 14.8% over the past three months. Goldman expects it to expand gradually over the next 90 days, with a 3% value increase in the S&P 500, followed by a 6% gain in the last three months of the year. At the core of Goldman’s bullish thesis are strong fundamentals and favorable policy dynamics. The Wall Street heavyweight projects S&P 500 earnings-per-share (EPS) to grow by 7% both this year and next, fueled by solid consumer demand, margin expansion, and robust performance from top-tier index constituents. Additional support is expected from the Federal Reserve via “earlier and deeper” interest rate cuts. Still, Goldman acknowledges that risks remain. “The shifting tariff landscape creates large uncertainty around our earnings forecasts, which are roughly in line with consensus in 2025, but below consensus in 2026,” David Kostin, the firm’s Chief U.S. Equity Strategist, noted in the team's July 7 report. In light of all this, Goldman highlighted three stocks to watch in the second half of 2025 that it believes are well-positioned to benefit from its broader market thesis. Kohl’sNYSE: KSS, Intellia TherapeuticsNASDAQ: NTLA, and Gogo Inc.NASDAQ: GOGO are each tied to structural trends Goldman sees driving outperformance: retail repositioning, gene-editing breakthroughs, and the expansion of in-flight connectivity. Kohl’s is trading down 33.40% for the year, although its share price is up 20.5% over the past 90 days. The stock also comes with a hefty 5.35% dividend. Due to its high short interest and a deeply discounted valuation, Goldman sees Kohl’s as a classic contrarian opportunity. Despite ongoing challenges in the retail space, Kohl’s is taking strategic steps to reposition itself, such as focusing on inventory discipline, cost-cutting measures, and enhancing its loyalty program. This should help stabilize its revenue in the second half of the year. In addition, Kostin noted that stocks with high floating-rate debt should benefit from lower bond yields when the Federal Reserve rate cuts are implemented later in the year, as expected. Kohl’s should meet that criteria, offering a rare retail sector upside along with a low forward P/E multiple and dividend that income-minded investors will likely appreciate. This Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biotech firm has seen its share price skyrocket by 45.3% in the past month—a huge rebound for a company looking to find solid footing in the gene-editing space. Intellia develops drugs with CRISPR-based therapies, pioneering in vivo therapies for rare genetic disorders, including hereditary angioedema and transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR). Although its programs remain in early-stage clinical development, Intellia has garnered significant recognition for its robust intellectual property portfolio and scientific leadership, earning credibility across both the biotech and investor communities. NTLA is a likely beneficiary of Eli Lilly'sNYSE: LLY acquisition of Verve TherapeuticsNASDAQ: VERV, a specialist in genetic cardiovascular medicines. The $1.3 billion deal spotlighted the importance of gene therapies and editing, where NTLA shines. For investors with a tolerance for volatility, Intellia stands out as a long-term growth story that is currently trading at a short-term discount, despite the recent share price boost. Though not an S&P 500 constituent, Gogo earned a spot on Goldman’s radar thanks to its leadership in business aviation connectivity. The firm recently initiated coverage of Gogo with a Buy rating and a $15 price target, citing strong recurring revenues and the rollout of its next-generation 5G air-to-ground network as key growth drivers. GOGO's stock price is up a whopping 117% over the past three months, and the good times should continue after Gogo just earned a Supplemental Type Certification for 42 aircraft types via the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. The certification comprises 70% of the company’s current air-to-ground customer North American aircraft inventory. Additionally, the aerospace technology company announced the first-ever completed call using Gogo’s GCT chipset. This maximizes 5G-related transmission outputs and expands the company’s air-to-ground communications transmissions supported by a network of 170 5G towers. Gogo expects a “full go” on its 5G chip by 2026. While the broader chip development work has been led by AI and hyperscalers, Gogo offers customers exposure to aviation infrastructure with a growth curve that's just starting to steepen with its 5G rollout underway. Goldman believes Gogo is a good example of a niche technology that should accelerate in the second half of 2025. In particular, GOGO shares meet Goldman’s growth formula, characterized by a negative bond yield correlation, a strong recurring revenue model, and an improving capital markets backdrop, all of which position GOGO on a favorable path for the remainder of 2025.

"Fastenal Surges After Earnings Beat, Tariff Risks Loom",https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/fastenal-surges-after-earnings-beat-tariff-risks-loom/,"Fastenal Co. NASDAQ: FAST stock is up more than 4.5% in early trading after the company reported a double-beat in its second quarter earnings report. The company delivered a slight beat on both the top and bottom lines. However, the results were more bullish on a year-over-year (YOY) basis. Fastenal reported earnings per share (EPS) of 29 cents for the most recent quarter. That was a penny higher than the 28 cents expected. It was also 11% higher than the split-adjusted 26 cents per share it delivered in the same quarter in 2024. Revenue of $2.08 billion narrowly topped expectations of $2.07 billion. However, when viewed YOY, the company posted a gain of 8.6%. This was also the first time in the company’s history that it posted over $2 billion in revenue in a single quarter. Fastenal is a leading distributor of industrial and construction supplies. The company’s portfolio includes fasteners, safety supplies, and other product lines. Because the company’s product lines are closely tied to manufacturing and industrial markets, the company’s results are considered a bellwether for this sector. That’s particularly true since the company is reporting at the start of earnings season. However, taking a close look at this report may caution investors about what the company is saying about the manufacturing industry. Fastenal’s results would seem to be bullish for industrial stocks. In addition to the headline numbers, the company reported a YOY increase in gross margin to 45.3% from 45.1%. This was due in part to improved margins on fastener sales and improvements with supplier-focused initiatives. The company’s YOY operating margin also increased to 21% from 20.2%. However, it's important to put those margin numbers in context. In the company’s earnings presentation, Fastenal commented that the company’s regional leadership believes its growth was due “more to customer wins and (market) share gains than the overall market, which remains subdued.” The company also noted: This uncertainty is one reason the company expects its operating margins to be flat for the rest of 2025. It’s also likely the reason that Fastenal didn’t provide forward-looking guidance. The gap up in FAST stock at the market open has pushed the price decisively above the 50-period simple moving average (SMA) at $43.05. This is a bullish technical signal that suggests strengthening momentum and improving sentiment. Solid volume supports the bullish move, confirming broad participation that's been in place since the company split its stock in May. The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) line continues to be above the signal line and supports a move higher. Importantly, this isn’t just about the company’s earnings. The post-earnings move confirms an uptrend that’s defined the stock for the last month. FAST stock has been in a bullish pattern of higher highs and higher lows since the middle of June. That said, investors will want to watch for potential resistance around the $46 level. A breakout above this level would put the stock close to the consensus analyst price target of $48.45.  FAST stock has been a standout performer in 2025, up 26%. That's pushed its valuation above its historical averages as measured by its 44x price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Investors looking to buy on weakness may want to look at an area around $44. This area marked resistance for the stock in the last month and corresponds to the 50-day simple moving average around $43. Before you consider Fastenal, you'll want to hear this.

"The Paramount comics, Colbert and Stewart, are sharp critics of the '60 Minutes' deal",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/the-paramount-comics-colbert-and-stewart-are-sharp-critics-of-the-60-minutes-deal-2025-07-15/,"NEW YORK (AP) — This isn't a joke. They've made that clear. CBS “Late Show” host Stephen Colbert condemned parent company Paramount Global's settlement of President Donald Trump's lawsuit over a “60 Minutes” story as a “big fat bribe” during his first show back from a vacation. Colbert followed “The Daily Show” host Jon Stewart's attack of the deal one week earlier. Stewart works for Comedy Central, also owned by Paramount, making the two comics the most visible internal critics of the $16 million settlement that was announced on July 1. Colbert's “bribe” reference was to the pending sale of Paramount to Skydance Media, which needs Trump administration approval. Critics of the deal that ended Trump's lawsuit over the newsmagazine's editing of its interview last fall with Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris suggested it was primarily to clear a hurdle to that sale. “I am offended,” Colbert said in his monologue Monday night. “I don't know if anything — anything — will repair my trust in this company. But, just taking a stab at it, I'd say $16 million would help.” He said the technical name in legal circles for the deal was “big fat bribe.” Stewart began discussing the “shameful settlement” on his show a week earlier when he was “interrupted” by a fake Arby's ad on the screen. “That's why it was so wrong,” he said upon his “return.” He discussed the deal in greater detail with the show's guest, retired “60 Minutes” correspondent Steve Kroft, making his views clear through a series of leading questions. “I would assume internally, this is devastating to the people who work in a place that pride themselves on contextual, good journalism?” Stewart asked. “Devastating is a good word,” Kroft replied. A handful of media reports in the past two weeks have speculated that Skydance boss David Ellison might try to curry favor with Trump by eliminating the comics' jobs if the sale is approved. A representative for Ellison did not immediately return a message for comment on Tuesday. It would be easier to get rid of Stewart, since he works one night a week at a network that no longer produces much original content. Colbert is the ratings leader in late-night broadcast television, however, and is a relentless Trump critic. The antipathy is mutual. Trump called Colbert “a complete and total loser” in a Truth Social post last fall, suggesting CBS was wasting its money on him. “HE IS VERY BORING,” Trump wrote. Colbert alluded to reports about his job security in his monologue, pointing to the mustache he grew during his vacation. “OK, OK, but how are they going to put pressure on Stephen Colbert, if they can't find him?” he joked. Colbert and Stewart both earned Emmy nominations this week for outstanding talk series. Together with ABC's Jimmy Kimmel, all three nominees are tough on Trump. CBS News journalists have largely been quiet publicly since the settlement's announcement. Two top executives, CBS News CEO Wendy McMahon and “60 Minutes"" executive producer Bill Owens, both quit or were forced out prior to the settlement for making their dissatisfaction about the idea known internally. Reporting about the settlement on the day it was announced, “CBS Evening News” anchor John Dickerson said viewers would have to decide on their own what it meant to them. “Can you hold power to account after paying it millions?"" Dickerson asked. “Can an audience trust you when it thinks you've traded away that trust? The audience will decide that. Our job is to show up to honor what we witness on behalf of the people.” ___ David Bauder writes about the intersection of media and entertainment for the AP.

Tesla: 2 Plays Ahead of Next Week's Earnings Report,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/tesla-2-plays-ahead-of-next-weeks-earnings-report/,"Tesla Inc. NASDAQ: TSLA heads into next week's earnings report with a lot riding on the outcome. Shares have surged as much as 70% from their multi-year lows reached in April, and while they've given back some of the gains, they're still up close to an impressive 50%. With earnings scheduled for Wednesday of next week, investors now face a pivotal moment: Will Tesla back up the recent gains with strong numbers, or is there a painful reversal on the cards? Depending on your appetite for risk, two distinct paths lie ahead. Here's how you can take advantage of the setup yourself. If you believe in the company's long-term vision and are optimistic about Tesla in general, next week's catalyst presents a compelling opportunity to get involved beforehand. Analysts from Mizuho and Wedbush have already reiterated their bullish stances this month, highlighting significant long-term potential that is hard to ignore if you're a Tesla bull. In particular, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives stands out with his $500 price target, implying more than 50% upside potential from where the stock closed on Monday. Ives believes Tesla's dominant position in electric vehicles, along with long-term autonomous driving potential, justifies continued bullishness even after the recent gains. Mizuho has a similarly upbeat stance and has emphasized that recent execution improvements and increased clarity around its Robotaxi ambitions strengthen Tesla's prospects for further growth. This bullish scenario strongly suggests buying the stock, if not increasing an existing position, ahead of earnings. If the numbers beat expectations or if management provides better-than-forecasted guidance, shares could easily spike towards recent highs around $370 and potentially begin a fresh leg towards $400 and beyond. From a technical perspective, the stock has started to set some higher lows and lower highs, effectively forming the start of a pennant. Don't be surprised if this pattern continues to emerge in the coming sessions, with a clear break in one direction likely coming with the results. While plenty of Tesla bulls are on Wall Street, not every analyst is convinced. Last week, a notable downgrade from William Blair's Jed Dorsheimer pointed to the significant risks still lingering for Tesla. Dorsheimer lowered Tesla from Outperform to Market Perform, highlighting the recent removal of the $7,500 EV tax credit as a material headwind for consumer demand. This tax credit elimination could directly impact Tesla's sales volume and profitability, especially when combined with the potential threat to regulatory credits, which have been a big profit driver. These developments could overshadow what he still sees as positive long-term fundamentals, making next week's earnings particularly dicey. If you share this slightly bullish yet cautious outlook, your trading strategy should be more about risk management. Investors could start scaling into a small position ahead of the report to ensure they catch some of the upside if the stock takes off, but they should hold back most of their gunpowder until the uncertainty has been removed. In the best-case scenario, you can buy even more Tesla shares at a discount; in the worst-case scenario, you can add to your position as the stock breaks out to the north. Keep in mind, though, that any stumble, particularly concerning demand outlook or margins, could trigger a sharp pullback that might take some weeks to play out. Given Tesla's recent rally and rich valuation, a negative surprise could quickly drive the stock back towards key technical support around $280. Either way, next week's earnings will be a defining moment. Tesla has long had a reputation for keeping investors on their toes, and it doesn't look like it's going to stop doing that anytime soon.

Pelosi Makes Big Bet on Broadcom—Here’s Why It Matters,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/pelosi-makes-big-bet-on-broadcomheres-why-it-matters/,"For better or for worse, there is now an uncommon indicator that investors can consider when searching for the next big potential move in the stock market: keeping track of what members of the United States Congress are buying or selling for their portfolios. While there is a lot of red tape around the fact that these individuals (with potential inside information) are buying, the fact is that investors can still benefit from this information. One specific investor is Nancy Pelosi, who has become famous for her bold calls in the technology sector over the past couple of years, to the extent that whatever she ends up buying or selling is now seen as one of the surest indicators of a stock's future direction. For this reason, investors should pay attention to her latest stock pick, as evidence will suggest a much broader theme is developing in its favor. The stock in question is Broadcom Inc.NASDAQ: AVGO, a key player in the semiconductor and chipmaking industry, a red-hot area of the global economy now that the United States and China have accelerated their artificial intelligence race to full momentum, bringing numerous unknown catalysts down the road. At least, unknown to the retail investor, but that’s where Nancy Pelosi’s portfolio can help. Nancy Pelosi has been holding a large number (20,000) of call options on shares of Broadcom in recent months. Considering that the stock now trades at a new 52-week high after rallying up to 13% over the past month alone, it seems that Pelosi’s conviction in the stock's future is as high as ever, despite her call options being deep in profit already. Investors can conclude this because she decided to exercise these call options, which means her contracts assigned her the underlying stock stipulated in each call option contract. This event requires a significant cash investment since the leverage aspect of options disappears as a result, and that investment is estimated to be between $1 and $5 million. By simply selling her call options, Pelosi could have realized a substantial profit, but by choosing to receive this much stock, the message quickly becomes that she is not done riding this name higher. As it turns out, there is a very good reason behind this choice. President Trump recently announced a new investment wave for the world of artificial intelligence and its role in the United States economy, willing to lay down as much as $70 billion in an attempt to onshore chip and semiconductor production. This is where Broadcom comes into play. Its significant footprint in the United States positions it near the top of the $70 billion investment queue, and markets are now discovering the potential upside this could bring to Broadcom stock. While the current consensus price target for Broadcom stock stands at roughly $290 per share, some analysts have chosen to take matters into their own hands to reflect what is truly happening beneath the surface of the company and the broader industry. Analysts from HSBC, who collectively landed on a Buy rating for the stock, and a valuation target of up to $400 for the company as well. This view would not only call for a wide margin to be achieved in terms of new 52-week highs but also imply that Broadcom shareholders stand to make an additional 43% return from the current stock price. That would explain why Nancy Pelosi chose to exercise her options rather than cut her profits short, and now the rest of the market is catching on to this future scenario. Because Broadcom stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of up to 105.2x today, it commands a significant premium to the rest of the computer sector, with an average valuation of 33.1x. While some investors may suggest this is too “expensive” and overextended, seasoned participants will remind them that the markets are always willing to overpay for the names they believe can deliver a significant performance, leaving the broader S&P 500 index and other peers in the dust. Now that there is a significant catalyst in part of government spending and investment, justifying this multi-million dollar position by someone who probably has the best information as to where the $70 billion might end up, investors shouldn’t ignore the fact that Broadcom could be a name to bring some additional returns to their portfolios this year.

"Do as I say, not as I do: On my failings as an investor",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/do-as-i-say-not-as-i-do-on-my-failings-as-an-investor-2025-07-15/,"If a knowledgeable observer trained his or her sights on my choices, what are the trouble spots they would identify? Here are some of the biggies. I understand the tax implications of this, so I might as well sell each lot of restricted stock units as soon as it vests because there’s no tax benefit to hanging on longer. And it’s not like I think I possess some inside knowledge that the shares are likely to outperform the broad market. Instead, the key culprit here is inertia. There’s a little bit of tax dread mixed in, too, as selling them would trigger a big tax bill. I’ve been in the process of divesting from company stock for the past several years, but the allocation is still high. Even when cash yields are higher, as they are today, inflation still gobbles up most of the interest. Cash has stacked up in our account following bonuses or other windfalls, or during fallow spending periods like 2020. And it just never feels like an especially great time to move the money into long-term investments. Perhaps most important, having cash on hand confers valuable peace of mind. I like knowing that almost anything could happen, and we’d be able to cover it without touching our long-term investments. I think of cash as one of my luxury goods. My husband and I should have a good slug of retirement assets in fixed-income investments at our life stage. But our portfolio is oddly barbelled, with a healthy dose of cash alongside a long-term portfolio that’smainly invested in equities. In a way, I think the cash and the equities work together from a psychological perspective, with the liquid assets giving us peace of mind to stay the course with stocks. But the lack of bonds isn’t really deliberate. Instead, inertia is probably the main reason. We set up our long-term portfolios with heavy equity allocations in our 30s, and we’ve never really wavered. But this is something that I’d like to address as retirement approaches. There’s a fantastic fund I own—but in our taxable brokerage account. If I could do it again, I’d buy this fund in a tax-sheltered account, because it has made some significant capital gains distributions over the years, which have boosted our household’s annual tax bills. Asset-location problems can be difficult to fix. Even though our reinvested capital gains have helped boost our cost basis, we would still owe a big tax bill if we liquidated the position because of the fund’s gains. Ideally, IRA contributions would go in right around the first of the year, to benefit from tax-sheltered compounding for a longer period. And our IRAs sit right alongside our taxable brokerage account, so transferring funds from the brokerage account to the IRA and converting them to Roth is simple. But I’ve sometimes made those IRA contributions right before the deadline, a full 15 months later than when we were first eligible to make them. I’ve also been slow to make the conversions to Roth, periodically letting a few years’ worth of contributions stack up in our IRAs before converting. The baby bear market of March 2020 provided a good opportunity to convert all the traditional IRA assets to Roth with no tax repercussions. I’ve been walking the straight and narrow—with timely contributions and conversions —ever since. ___ This article was provided to The Associated Press by Morningstar.

Federal judge reverses rule that would have removed medical debt from credit reports,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/federal-judge-reverses-rule-that-would-have-removed-medical-debt-from-credit-reports-2025-07-15/,"NEW YORK (AP) — A federal judge in Texas removed a Biden-era finalized rule by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that would have removed medical debt from credit reports. U.S. District Court Judge Sean Jordan of Texas's Eastern District, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, found on Friday that the rule exceeded the CFPB 's authority. Jordan said that the CFPB is not permitted to remove medical debt from credit reports according to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which protects information collected by consumer reporting agencies. Removing medical debt from consumer credit reports was expected to increase the credit scores of millions of families by an average of 20 points, the bureau said. The CFPB states that its research has shown outstanding healthcare claims to be a poor predictor of an individual’s ability to repay a loan, yet they are often used to deny mortgage applications. The three national credit reporting agencies — Experian, Equifax and TransUnion — announced last year that they would remove medical collections under $500 from U.S. consumer credit reports. The CFPB’s rule was projected to ban all outstanding medical bills from appearing on credit reports and prohibit lenders from using the information. The CFPB estimated the rule would have removed $49 billion in medical debt from the credit reports of 15 million Americans. According to the agency, one in five Americans has at least one medical debt collection account on their credit reports, and over half of the collection entries on credit reports are for medical debts. The problem disproportionately affects people of color, the CFPB has found: 28% of Black people and 22% of Latino people in the U.S. carry medical debt versus 17% of white people. The CFPB was established by Congress after the 2008 financial crisis to monitor credit card companies, mortgage providers, debt collectors and other segments of the consumer finance industry. Earlier this year, the Trump administration requested that the agency halt nearly all its operations, effectively shutting it down. — “The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

America's only rare earth producer gets a boost from Apple and Pentagon agreements,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/americas-only-rare-earth-producer-gets-a-boost-from-apple-and-pentagon-agreements-2025-07-15/,"MP Materials, which runs the only American rare earths mine, announced a new $500 million agreement with tech giant Apple on Tuesday to produce more of the powerful magnets used in iPhones as well as other high-tech products like electric vehicles. This news comes on the heels of last week’s announcement that the U.S. Defense Department agreed to invest $400 million in shares of the Las Vegas-based company, establish a floor for the price of key elements and ensure that all of the magnets made at a new plant in the first 10 years are purchased. That unusual direct investment in the company makes the government the largest shareholder in MP Materials. “This is the kind of long-term commitment needed to reshape global rare earth supply chains,” Neha Mukherjee, a rare earths analyst with Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, said in a research note on the Pentagon deal. Rare earths are a key concern in ongoing U.S. trade talks. China dominates the market and imposed new limits on exports after President Donald Trump announced his widespread tariffs. When shipments dried up, the two sides sat down in London. Despite their name, the 17 rare earth elements aren’t actually rare, but it’s hard to find them in a high enough concentration to make a mine worth the investment. They are important ingredients in everything from smartphones and submarines to wind turbines and fighter jets. The agreement with Apple will allow MP Materials to further expand its new factory in Texas to use recycled materials to produce magnets that make iPhones vibrate. The company expects to start producing magnets for GM's electric vehicles later this year, and this agreement will let it start producing magnets for Apple in 2027. The Apple deal represents a sliver of the company's pledge to invest $500 billion domestically during the Trump administration. And although the deal will provide a significant boost for MP Materials, the agreement with the Defense Department is likely to be even more meaningful. Mukherjee, the analyst, says the Pentagon's 10-year promise to guarantee a minimum price for the key elements of neodymium and praseodymium will guarantee stable revenue for MP Minerals and protect it from potential price cuts by Chinese producers that are subsidized by their government. The Apple deal to produce magnets from recycled materials will also help, she said, but it won’t provide enough magnets to satisfy demand, meaning more sources of these elements are still needed. Steve Christensen, executive director of the Responsible Battery Coalition, an association representing battery makers, automakers and battery sellers, said he's optimistic that these new investments in MP Materials might be part of a larger trend of increasing domestic production and processing of these key elements. “Expanding extraction is great, and we need more of it and investments along the value chain,"" Christensen said. “The metals produced from MP will lessen our dependence on China.” That's a priority for Trump, and his administration is both helping MP Materials and trying to encourage the development of new mines that would take years to come to fruition. China has agreed to issue some permits for rare earth exports but not for military uses, and much uncertainty remains about their supply. The fear is that the trade war between the world’s two biggest economies could lead to a critical shortage that could disrupt production of a variety of products. MP Materials can't satisfy all of the U.S. demand from its Mountain Pass mine in California’s Mojave Desert. The deals by MP Materials come as Beijing and Washington have agreed to walk back on their non-tariff measures: China is to grant export permits for rare earth magnets to the U.S., and the U.S. is easing export controls on chip design software and jet engines. The truce is intended to ease tensions and prevent any catastrophic fall-off in bilateral relations, but is unlikely to address fundamental differences as both governments take steps to reduce dependency on each other. ___ Associated Press writers David Klepper and Didi Tang in Washington and Michael Liedtke in San Francisco contributed.

France's prime minister wants to cut 2 public holidays to save money for the indebted economy,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/frances-prime-minister-wants-to-cut-2-public-holidays-to-save-money-for-the-indebted-economy-2025-07-15/,"PARIS (AP) — France’s prime minister proposed on Tuesday the elimination of two public holidays from the country’s annual calendar — possibly Easter Monday and the day marking the Allied victory over the Nazis — to save money in next year’s budget. That's among a raft of spending cuts laid out by Prime Minister Francois Bayrou in a sweeping, and potentially doomed, budget plan. He argued that removing two state holidays would bring in tax revenues generated from economic activity, contributing to around 44 billion euros ($51.3 billion) in overall savings. President Emmanuel Macron tasked Bayrou with crafting a budget that shaves costs to bring down France’s staggering debt and deficit — while also adding billions in new defense spending to face what Macron says are resurgent threats from Russia and beyond. Bayrou questioned the religious importance of Easter Monday. And Victory Day, celebrated on May 8, comes in a month that has become a “veritable Gruyere,” or holey cheese, of days off that includes May Day and the Catholic holiday of Ascension, he said. He said that those holidays were just suggestions, and that he was open to other ideas. France currently has 11 official holidays per year. With no parliamentary majority, Macron’s centrist grouping must win support from adversaries on the left and right to pass the budget this fall. Bayrou's proposals, which are just a first step in the budget process, were quickly assailed by unions and the far-right National Rally, the largest single party in the lower house of Parliament. Bayrou’s job is precarious, and he could be voted out if he fails to reach compromise on the budget. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

Senate votes to move ahead with Trump's request for $9 billion in spending cuts,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/republicans-are-considering-changes-to-trumps-request-for-94-billion-in-spending-cuts-2025-07-15/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate Republicans on Tuesday advanced President Donald Trump's request to cancel some $9 billion in previously approved spending, overcoming concerns from some lawmakers about what the rescissions could mean for impoverished people around the globe and for public radio and television stations in their home states. The Senate vote was 50-50, with Vice President JD Vance breaking the tie. A final vote in the Senate could occur as early as Wednesday. The bill would then return to the House for another vote before it would go to Trump's desk for his signature before a Friday deadline. Republicans winnowed down the president's request by taking out his proposed $400 million cut to a program known as PEPFAR. That change increased the prospects for the bill's passage. The politically popular program is credited with saving millions of lives since its creation under then-President George W. Bush to combat HIV/AIDS. The president is also looking to claw back money for foreign aid programs targeted by his Department of Government Efficiency and for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. “When you’ve got a $36 trillion debt, we have to do something to get spending under control,"" said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D. Republicans met with Russ Vought, the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, during their weekly conference luncheon as the White House worked to address their concerns. He fielded about 20 questions from senators. The White House campaign to win over potential holdouts had some success. Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., tweeted that he would vote to support the measure after working with the administration to “find Green New Deal money that could be reallocated to continue grants to tribal radio stations without interruption.” Some senators worried that the cuts to public media could decimate many of the 1,500 local radio and television stations around the country that rely on some federal funding to operate. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting distributes more than 70% of its funding to those stations. Maine Sen. Susan Collins, the Republican chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said she was particularly concerned about a lack of specifics from the White House. “The rescissions package has a big problem — nobody really knows what program reductions are in it,"" Collins said. “That isn’t because we haven’t had time to review the bill. Instead, the problem is that OMB has never provided the details that would normally be part of this process.” Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said she didn't want the Senate to be going through numerous rounds of rescissions. “We are lawmakers. We should be legislating,” Murkowski said. “What we're getting now is a direction from the White House and being told: 'This is the priority and we want you to execute on it. We'll be back with you with another round.' I don't accept that.” Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., Collins and Murkowski joined with Democrats in voting against the Senate taking up the measure. McConnell said he wanted to make clear he didn't have any problem with reducing spending, but agreed with Collins that lawmakers didn't have enough details from the White House. “They would like a blank check is what they would like. And I don’t think that’s appropriate,"" McConnell said. But the large majority of Republicans were supportive of Trump's request. “This bill is a first step in a long but necessary fight to put our nation’s fiscal house in order,"" said Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo. Democrats warned that it’s absurd to expect them to work with Republicans on bipartisan spending measures if Republicans turn around a few months later and use their majority to cut the parts they don’t like. “It shreds the appropriations process,” said Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine who caucuses with Democrats. “The Appropriations Committee, and indeed this body, becomes a rubber stamp for whatever the administration wants.” Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said that tens of millions of Americans rely on local public radio and television stations for local news, weather alerts and educational programs. He warned that many could lose access to that information because of the rescissions. “And these cuts couldn't come at a worse time,” Schumer said. ""The floods in Texas remind us that speedy alerts and up-to-the-minute forecasts can mean the difference between life and death.” Democrats also scoffed at the GOP's stated motivation for taking up the bill. The amount of savings pales compared to the $3.4 trillion in projected deficits over the next decade that Republicans put in motion in passing Trump's big tax and spending cut bill two weeks ago. “Now, Republicans are pretending they are concerned about the debt,"" said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash. “So concerned that they need to shut down local radio stations, so concerned they are going to cut off ‘Sesame Street.’ ... The idea that that is about balancing the debt is laughable.” With Republicans providing enough votes to take up the bill, it sets up the potential for 10 hours of debate plus votes on scores of potentially thorny amendments in what is known as a vote-a-rama. The House has already shown its support for the president’s request with a mostly party line 214-212 vote, but since the Senate is amending the bill, it will have to go back to the House for another vote. Republicans who vote against the measure also face the prospect of incurring Trump's wrath. He has issued a warning on his social media site directly aimed at individual Senate Republicans who may be considering voting against the rescissions package. He said it was important that all Republicans adhere to the bill and in particular defund the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. “Any Republican that votes to allow this monstrosity to continue broadcasting will not have my support or Endorsement,” he said. ____ Congressional correspondent Lisa Mascaro and staff writers Mary Clare Jalonick and Stephen Groves contributed to this report.

3 Analysts Set $600 Target Ahead of Microsoft Earnings,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/3-analysts-set-600-target-ahead-of-microsoft-earnings/,"Many investors expect analysts to change their ratings after a company reports earnings. However, in many cases, investors can get clues about a company’s upcoming earnings from analyst activity before the earnings report is released. If that’s the case, investors should be bullish about Microsoft Corporation NASDAQ: MSFT. The tech giant will report earnings on July 29, but analysts appear to be making bullish bets in advance. Since the beginning of July, MSFT stock has received one upgrade and three analysts have raised their price targets. Notably, three of those four analysts are setting a $600 price target for Microsoft. That’s 12% above the current consensus price of $534.14 and 18.9% above the stock’s opening price of $509.61 on July 15. Microsoft’s leadership in AI exemplifies how adaptability, not just scale, drives the company’s long-term bull case. As AI adoption accelerates, many young and nimble companies are popping up. However, Microsoft’s ability to evolve remains a key reason it commands a premium valuation and maintains its place among tech’s elite. This evolution is seen in its focus on artificial intelligence and cloud infrastructure through its entire product ecosystem. Azure has emerged as a leader in traditional cloud workloads and as a cornerstone of global AI development, powering everything from enterprise applications to advanced language models. Meanwhile, Microsoft 365 now integrates AI-powered Copilot tools that are redefining productivity, turning its established Windows and Office software into a fresh growth engine. This evolution is also visible in Microsoft’s push into cybersecurity, an area experiencing double-digit growth as enterprises prioritize digital defenses. The company’s expansion of Game Pass subscriptions and its integration of Activision Blizzard show how gaming has become another diversified revenue stream. This theme of constant reinvention is shared across the Magnificent Seven stocks. NVIDIA Corp. NASDAQ: NVDA has transformed itself from a GPU manufacturer into the backbone of AI infrastructure. Alphabet Inc. NASDAQ: GOOGL is embedding its Gemini AI into search and cloud products. Amazon.com Inc. NASDAQ: AMZN is scaling generative AI tools and automation across its logistics network, while Meta Platforms Inc. NASDAQ: META is integrating AI into advertising and content recommendations. NVIDIA beat Microsoft and other tech stocks to a $4 trillion market cap. However, Microsoft isn't far behind with a $3.75 trillion market cap. In fact, Dan Ives of Wedbush has forecast that the company will achieve a $5 trillion market cap in the next 18 months. Anyone paying attention to Microsoft’s growth in the past year knows that this comes down to growth in artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing (via the company’s Azure platform). Strong demand for AI solutions is driving Microsoft’s layoff announcements. The layoffs are part of the company’s push to replace some of its traditional sales force with solutions engineers. This is being done in response to customers who are demanding technical answers earlier in the sales process. MSFT stock has been trending higher in a well-established uptrend, consistently finding support above the 50-day simple moving average (SMA). This technical strength, combined with positive (albeit relatively flat) momentum from the MACD indicator, suggests continued bullish sentiment in the near term. If you’re a long-term investor, this chart gives you no reason to be concerned about heading into earnings. Analyst sentiment suggests that the company is likely to beat on the top and bottom lines, which would be bullish for the stock. One area of concern for those considering a new position might be the relative strength indicator (RSI), which is showing oversold conditions. This might inspire some profit-taking around the earnings report. However, if the stock breaks below its 50-day SMA, that would likely be a potential buying opportunity.

"Ukraine's prime minister resigns, opening the door to a broad government reshuffle",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/ukraines-prime-minister-resigns-opening-the-door-to-a-broad-government-reshuffle-2025-07-15/,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine’s prime minister announced his resignation Tuesday in the first formal step of what is expected to be a significant reshuffle of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government, which could also see the country’s ambassador to Washington replaced. “I am tendering my resignation from the post of the Prime Minister of Ukraine,” Denys Shmyhal wrote in a letter posted on his Telegram page. Zelenskyy said Monday that he has offered Shmyhal's job to 39-year-old Yuliia Svyrydenko, who is currently deputy prime minister and the country’s first female economy minister. Svyrydenko played a key role in negotiating a U.S.–Ukraine mineral agreement. She has frequently represented Ukraine in high-level talks with Western partners, focusing on defense cooperation, economic recovery and reconstruction. It wasn't immediately clear how the reshuffle will play out in coming days, as the Ukrainian parliament must schedule a vote on Zelenskyy’s proposed changes amid the all-out war launched by Russia on Feb. 24, 2022. The reshuffle coincides with increasing pressure on the front line by Russia’s bigger army and escalating assaults by drones and missiles on Ukrainian cities. U.S. President Donald Trump pledged Monday to supply more weapons for Ukraine, paid for by European countries. But Kyiv officials are keen to lock in Washington’s future support amid fears that the Republican administration could walk away from the conflict. “To us it is very important, in the context of what is happening now, to strengthen ties with the U.S.,” Zelenskyy said last week. The Ukrainian leader recently said that he thought Shmyhal would make a good defense minister — a move that would make the current defense chief, Rustem Umerov, available to take over as Ukraine’s envoy to Washington, observers note. Zelenskyy had previously voiced his intention to replace U.S. Ambassador Oksana Markarova. Umerov, 43, was appointed as Ukraine’s defense minister in September 2023, following a series of corruption scandals. He has sought to introduce reforms, but critics said that the Defense Ministry was plagued by mismanagement. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.
