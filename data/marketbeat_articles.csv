Mexican-American designer apologizes for Adidas sandal design accused of cultural appropriation,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/mexican-american-designer-apologizes-for-adidas-sandal-design-accused-of-cultural-appropriation-2025-08-12/,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexican-American clothing designer Willy Chavarria has apologized for an Adidas sandal he created after being accused by Mexican authorities of “cultural appropriation” for imitating an Indigenous shoe design. The design launched by Adidas, known as the Oaxaca Slip On, is a black sandal with braided leather straps attached to a chunky sports shoe sole. Mexican artisans and authorities say the intricate leather braids look strikingly similar to the traditional footwear known as huaraches made by the Zapotec Indigenous people in Oaxaca, produced mostly in the town of Villa Hidalgo Yalalag. They have accused the brand and Chavarria of “cultural appropriation” and of copying the design without the permission of the Indigenous community. Authorities were quick to note that cultural Mexican designs have long been copied by major brands before, and said they planned to tighten laws to protect Mexican designs. Chavarria responded to mounting criticisms in comments sent to The Associated Press on Tuesday. In a statement addressed to the “people of Oaxaca,” he said that the design was intended to “to honor the powerful cultural and artistic spirit of Oaxaca and its creative communities — a place whose beauty and resistance have inspired me.” “I am deeply sorry that the shoe was appropriated in this design and not developed in direct and meaningful partnership with the Oaxacan community,” Chavarria wrote. “This falls short of the respect and collaborative approach that Oaxaca, the Zapotec community of Villa Hidalgo Yalalag, and its people deserve.” Chavarria is a Mexican-American designer, who has risen to fame for his designs exploring Chicano, or Mexican-American, culture, often mixing Mexican themes with American products. His designs include sweaters reading “Chicano” in red, scripted font, and styles with the Mexican flag and cowboy hats reminiscent of northern Mexican culture. In recent months, Chavarria also was put in the spotlight for a show at Paris Fashion Week that was intended as criticism of the Trump administration's deportation policy. Chavarria's comments came days after Adidas made a public apology for the design, and in a statement said it was reaffirming “our commitment to collaborate with Yalalag in a respectful dialogue that honors their cultural legacy.” Last week, in a letter to Oaxacan state officials, the company requested to sit down with local officials and to discuss how it can “repair the damage” to Indigenous populations. “Adidas recognizes and values the cultural richness of Mexico’s Indigenous communities and the meaning of their artisanal heritage,” it wrote in a statement.

"Apple & Trump: $100B Investment, Tariffs News Push Shares Up 13%",https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/apple-and-trump-100b-investment-tariffs-news-lead-shares-higher/,"American technology stalwart Apple NASDAQ: AAPL just made headlines, with President Trump's influence and decision-making playing a key role in the stock's story. Below, we’ll detail two key pieces of news and explain why they are leading Apple shares higher. In February, Apple announced it would make a massive $500 billion investment in the United States over the next four years. On Aug. 6, the Magnificent Seven company upped the ante, committing an additional $100 billion investment to its home country. This move comes amid President Trump’s unwavering stance that he wants to see iPhones built in America. Trump reiterated this stance in a joint press conference with Apple CEO Tim Cook to announce the new investment. He called the investment “a significant step toward the ultimate goal of ensuring that iPhones sold in the United States of America also are made in America."" Cook did not parrot this notion. The economic advantage of producing iPhones overseas makes this unlikely. Analysts have estimated that producing an iPhone in the United States could bring its price to $3,500. That’s nearly triple the cost of the company’s most expensive iPhone 16 Pro Max model today, which retails for $1,199. This price increase would massively deteriorate Apple’s competitive positioning in the smartphone market. It is certainly not something investors should hope for. That’s part of the reason that markets are happy about the company’s latest U.S. investment. Trump has ramped up tariff pressure on Apple to get the firm to move iPhone manufacturing to the United States. With the latest investment, the company is garnering goodwill from the President, which can help it stay out of his tariff crosshairs. In the same press conference, Trump floated a 100% tariff on semiconductor imports. However, he said that companies that invest in America, like Apple, would be exempt from such regulations. Apple is playing ball with the President to protect its interests, and thus those of its shareholders. Additionally, on Aug. 6, Trump declared that he would raise India's tariff to 50%, starting 21 days after Aug. 7. This change is a response to India's continued oil imports from Russia. Initially, this appeared highly relevant to Apple. The company has moved much of its production for U.S.-sold iPhones to India, partly to avoid U.S. tariffs imposed on its traditional manufacturing hub, China. It reportedly hopes to move most of this production to India by the end of 2026. Higher tariffs on India would severely limit the company’s ambitions to avoid higher costs. However, further reports revealed that smartphones would be exempt from Indian tariffs. Apple won’t have to pay tariffs on Indian-made iPhones at all. It’s not unreasonable to think that the company’s $100 billion investment contributed to Trump’s exemption decision. Overall, Apple’s U.S. investments are helping it avoid tariffs in more ways than one: both on country and product-specific levies. Ultimately, these pieces of news led to Apple stock having one of its best weeks in quite a while. From Aug. 4 to Aug. 8, shares gained by more than 13%. Trump's tirade against the company has been one of the key factors weighing on Apple in 2025, with shares still down significantly on the year. Thus, it is only fitting that positive developments related to President Trump have resulted in positive price action. These news items are clearly good signs for Apple, indicating that the company could face less pressure from Trump going forward. Still, whether Apple can truly return to being a winner for stock market investors remains up in the air. The company has been extensively criticized for making underwhelming moves in artificial intelligence (AI). Markets want to see something change in the company's approach so that Apple can prove that it isn’t missing the boat on AI. Before you consider Apple, you'll want to hear this.

Oklo’s Stock Is Set up for a Correction—Buy It When It Bounces,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/oklos-stock-is-set-up-for-a-correctionbuy-it-when-it-bounces/,"Oklo’s NYSE: OKLO stock is poised for a correction in mid-Q3 because its explosive stock price increase attracted a fair number of short sellers, and the Q2 earnings release did not accelerate the timeline. The release was good, chock full of juicy news to keep investors interested, but no concrete changes or improvements to the revenue timeline. The takeaway is that this leading, advanced reactor company is well-positioned to deliver on its promise, with projects advancing, but no catalyst for higher share prices has emerged. In this scenario, the market could fall as much as 20% from the pre-release closing price before it begins to rebound, but when it does, it will be a screaming buy. Oklo is the leader in advanced, fast-reactor technology within the energy sector and is on track to commence operations within only a few years. Its vertically integrated model encompasses fuel, power, and adjacent isotope markets, offering a diversified income stream and cost efficiencies unmatched by any other advanced reactor company.  Critical highlights from the quarter include the Trump administration's numerous executive orders, which clear red tape, streamline and accelerate approval processes, and provide tax credits and funding for start-up projects. Among the impacts of the orders is the potential for a technology-proving pilot project to come online as soon as July 2026, years ahead of the existing timeline. Other critical highlights include partnerships with Vertiv, Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power, and Centrus that expand and deepen the company’s industry appeal while prepping future revenue streams. The initial analysts’ response to Oklo’s news is crickets; MarketBeat tracked no notes or revisions within the first 18 hours of the release. This is good news because the trends leading into the release were bullish, providing support for this market. The trends include increased coverage with the number of analysts rising by more than 200% to 13 since the first of the year, the Moderate Buy sentiment firming with several Strong Buy ratings creeping into the mix, and the price target advancing. The consensus lags the market in mid-August but is up more than 400% in the preceding 12 months, with the high-end range aligning with recent price action. The takeaway is that the market for OKLO stock outpaced analysts' sentiment, and their targets align with a price pullback. However, the price targets should provide solid support near the $60 level if not higher, aligning with the technical support targets. The institutional group is likely to be buyers on an OKLO stock price pullback. The group owns 85% of the stock and has been buying robustly this year, netting $2 in shares for every $1 sold. The Q3 activity shows buying ramping to a multiquarter high in the first half of Q3, an indication of increased demand and market support. While the long-term outlook for OKLO stock is bullish, the high and rising short-interest suggests the top is in for Q3 and potentially the remainder of the year. The short interest has been growing over the past few months and is running near 15% as of late July, and will likely remain high if not increase as the quarter progresses. The catalyst to cover will be a concrete improvement in the timeline to revenue, which could come at any time but may not materialize for several quarters. The post-release price action was tepid; however, the market fell more than 1% suggesting it is ready to move lower. The critical near-term support is near the $69 level; a move below it will likely attract bearish activity and result in a more profound decline. Before you consider Oklo, you'll want to hear this.

Spirit Airlines sounds the alarm on its future ability to stay in business,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/spirit-airlines-sounds-the-alarm-on-its-future-ability-to-stay-in-business-2025-08-12/,"NEW YORK (AP) — Just five months after emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, Spirit Airlines is warning about its future ability to stay in business. Spirit Aviation Holdings, the budget carrier's parent company, says it has “substantial doubt” about its ability to continue as a going concern over the next year — which is accounting-speak for running out of money. In a quarterly report issued Monday, Spirit pointed to “adverse market conditions"" that it's continued to face after a recent restructuring and other efforts to revive its business. That includes weak demand for domestic leisure travel, which Spirit said persisted in the second quarter of its fiscal year — among other challenges and “uncertainties in its business operations” that the Florida company expects to continue “for at least the remainder of 2025.” Spirit’s shares tumbled nearly 40% by midday Tuesday, with the company’s stock trading at just over $2.20 as of around 1 p.m. ET. Known for its no-frills, low-cost flights on a fleet of bright yellow planes, Spirit has struggled to recover and compete since the COVID-19 pandemic. Rising operation costs and mounting debt eventually led the company to seek bankruptcy protection in November. By the time of that Chapter 11 filing, the airline had lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020. When Spirit emerged from bankruptcy protection in March, the company successfully restructured some of its debt obligations and secured new financing for future operations. Spirit has continued to make other cost-cutting efforts since — including plans to furlough about 270 pilots and downgrade some 140 captains to first officers in the coming months. The furloughs and downgrades announced last month go into effect Oct. 1 and Nov. 1 to align with Spirit's “projected flight volume for 2026,” the company noted in its quarterly report. They also follow previous furloughs and job cuts before the company's bankruptcy filing last year. Despite these and other cost-cutting efforts, Spirit on Monday stressed that it needs more cash. As a result, the company said it may also sell certain aircraft and real estate. And as discount carriers struggle to compete with bigger airlines — many of which have snagged budget-conscious customers through their own tiered offerings — Spirit is attempting to tap into the growing market for more upscale travel. It is now offering flight options with tiered prices, the higher-priced tickets coming with more amenities. The company pointed to the new strategy again on Monday. Spirit’s aircraft fleet is relatively young, which has also made the airline an attractive takeover target. But such buyout attempts from budget rivals like JetBlue and Frontier were unsuccessful both before and during the bankruptcy process, and Spirit has not publicly indicated interest in such a transaction since.

Alphabet Reclaims $200 Threshold—Bull Run Reignited?,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/alphabet-reclaims-200-thresholdbull-run-reignited/,"Alphabet NASDAQ: GOOGL has quietly transformed what began as a shaky start to 2025 into a full-blown comeback. The stock lagged its Magnificent Seven peers early in the year, weighed down by regulatory fears and concerns that its dominance in search and advertising was wavering. Those worries are fading, and with them, the bears. As Alphabet leaned into its AI prowess, cloud strength, and ad resilience, its shares surged, and momentum is now firmly back. The stock is officially in the green year-to-date, up 6.18% as of Monday’s close, and has rocketed 32% in the past quarter alone, including an 11.5% jump this month alone. Most importantly, Alphabet has reclaimed the $200 level, a psychological and technical resistance point that had held it back for six months. Now sitting just under 3% from its 52-week high, Alphabet is setting itself up for a fresh breakout into uncharted territory. Technically, this is not an overbought sprint. Alphabet is still building its base, not blowing past resistance like many red-hot tech peers. The clean push through $200 after building weeks of momentum below it suggests more upside could be ahead, as long as the rally remains contained and measured. Alphabet’s compelling Q2 2025 earnings, released on July 23, are at the heart of the rebound. Total revenue of $96.43 billion beat expectations and reflected a substantial 14% year-over-year gain. Earnings per share came in at $2.31, well above consensus and up 22% YOY. Key growth came from advertising, cloud, and search. Google Cloud soared 32% to $13.62 billion, crossing the $50 billion annual run rate landmark. YouTube ad revenue climbed 13%, and, perhaps most importantly, Google Search & Other grew 11.7%, well above the 8% expected, helping to quiet concerns about AI disrupting Alphabet’s core business. These results weren’t ignored. Following the blowout quarter, a wave of analysts raised their price targets. Barclays lifted its target to $235 from $220, and JPMorgan increased it to $232 from $200. Multiple other firms followed suit. Institutional money also started flowing back in. Cathie Wood’s ARKW recently added $35 million in Alphabet shares. Zooming out, over the previous twelve months, institutions have been busy buying shares of the tech giant. In total, $96 billion worth of GOOGL has been purchased versus $52 billion in outflows over the previous year. Despite the surge in momentum, GOOGL still looks reasonably priced. Its current P/E is around 21.4, and its forward P/E of 18.9 remains well below its historical standards. So even after a 32% quarterly move, Alphabet isn’t trading at a tech bubble multiple, making the risk-reward picture more compelling for disciplined investors. For those anticipating more upside, a logical entry could be on a pullback toward key support zones near $190 or even $180, where resistance was overturned earlier in the year. If Alphabet can reclaim a clean stair-step pattern above $200, reinforced by analyst upgrades and institutional faith, it could quietly morph into one of this year’s strongest major-cap tech stories.

"Syria, US and Jordan say they will work toward a lasting truce in wake of Syrian sectarian clashes",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/jordan-syria-and-us-officials-discuss-syrias-reconstruction-after-deadly-clashes-2025-08-12/,"BEIRUT (AP) — Syrian, U.S. and Jordanian officials said Tuesday they would work together toward a permanent ceasefire in a southern Syrian region wracked by deadly sectarian clashes last month that threatened the country's fragile transition in the wake of its yearslong civil war. The announcement came after three-way talks, held in the Jordanian capital of Amman, seeking ways to support post-war reconstruction efforts of Syria's new authorities. The discussions between U.S. special envoy Tom Barrack and Syrian and Jordanian foreign ministers, Asaad al-Shibani and Ayman Safadi, were the second such meeting, following talks held in July. The first round focused on a ceasefire that ended days of clashes in the southern Sweida province between government forces and local Bedouin tribesmen on one side, and fighters from the country’s Druze minority on the other. Hundreds were killed, including many civilians. Since Islamist-led insurgents ousted former President Bashar Assad in a rebel offensive in December, the new government they put in place in Damascus has struggled to maintain stability and heal the wounds of the nearly 14-year civil war. Though the fighting in Sweida has largely ended, tensions remain and minority communities have grown increasingly wary of the new authorities in the capital of Damascus, calling for a decentralized government. A joint statement issued after Tuesday's Amman talks reaffirmed that Sweida, “with all its local communities, is an integral part” of Syria and that the safety of its communities must be safeguarded and ""preserved in the process of rebuilding a new Syria.” It backed efforts to investigate “crimes and violations” committed in Sweida — including allegations that government fighters executed Druze civilians. Videos of such killings have caused an outcry, including recent footage of what appears to be the killing of a medic by men in military uniform in a Sweida hospital. Tensions have also risen between the central government in Damascus and the U.S.-allied and Kurdish-led forces that control northeastern Syria. Implementation of an agreement reached in March to merge the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces with the Syrian army, made up of mostly former rebels and insurgents, has stalled, and there have been scattered outbreaks of violence between the two sides. Syria's state-run news agency SANA reported on Tuesday that SDF fighters had infiltrated an area controlled by the Syrian army east of the city of Aleppo, leading to clashes that killed a Syrian soldier. Syria also faces major economic and social challenges. In 2017, the United Nations estimated that it would cost at least $250 billion to rebuild Syria while some experts now say that figure is more likely to be at least $400 billion. Several countries, including Saudi Arabia, Qatar and others have in recent months pledged investments worth billions of dollars to rebuild Syria's infrastructure. Syrian Energy Minister Mohammed al-Bashir met with his Iraqi counterpart, Hayan Abdel-Ghani, in Iraq where they discussed the possibility of reactivating an oil pipeline between the oil-rich northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk and Syria's coastal town of Baniyas, which is home to one of the country’s two oil refineries. SANA quoted al-Bashir as saying that Syria imports 3 million barrels of oil a month, in addition to its own production, to cover local consumption. The report cited Abdel-Ghani as saying the two countries would have to look into what it would take to reactivate the pipeline, which suffered wide damage during wars in both countries — or build a new one. Before the war broke out in 2011, the oil sector was a pillar of Syria’s economy, with the country producing about 380,000 barrels a day, and exports — mostly to Europe — bringing in more than $3 billion in 2010. Since then, the sector has suffered widely. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

Kodak cautions on business operations but remains confident it can meet debt obligations,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/kodak-cautions-theres-substantial-doubt-about-its-ability-to-stay-in-business-2025-08-12/,"The more than 130-year-old Eastman Kodak Co. is cautioning on its business operations, but says it is confident it will be able to work out upcoming debt obligations. “Kodak has debt coming due within 12 months and does not have committed financing or available liquidity to meet such debt obligations if they were to become due in accordance with their current terms,” the company wrote in a regulatory filing. “These conditions raise substantial doubt about Kodak's ability to continue as a going concern.” The Rochester, New York-based company said that it had $155 million of cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, with $70 million held within the U.S. Kodak said in a statement on Tuesday that the going concern language in its regulatory filing is essentially a required disclosure because its debt comes due within 12 months of the filing. “Kodak is confident it will be able to pay off a significant portion of its term loan well before it becomes due, and amend, extend or refinance our remaining debt and/or preferred stock obligations,” the company said. Last year Kodak said that it would end its retirement income plan in order to pay down debt, according to The Wall Street Journal. Kodak Chief Financial Officer David Bullwinkle said in a statement on Monday that the company expects to know by Friday how it will satisfy its obligations to pay all pension plan participants and foresees completing the reversion by December. Founded by George Eastman in 1880, Eastman Kodak Co. is credited with popularizing photography at the start of the 20th century and was known all over the world for its Brownie and Instamatic cameras and its yellow-and-red film boxes. It was first brought down by Japanese competition and then an inability to keep pace with the shift from film to digital technology. Kodak filed for bankruptcy protection in 2012 after struggling with increasing competition, continuing growth in digital photography and growing debt. The company wound up selling off many of its businesses and patents, while shutting down the camera manufacturing unit that first made it famous. It received approval for its plan to emerge from court oversight a year later. At the time, Kodak was looking to recreate itself as a new, much smaller company focused on commercial and packaging printing. Kodak is now nearing completion on a manufacturing plant to create regulated pharmaceutical products. The company already makes unregulated key starting materials for pharmaceuticals. Production at the retrofitted facility is expected to start later this year. Shares slid more than 25% in midday trading. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

How Vertiv Is Cashing in on AI's Power Crisis,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/how-vertiv-is-cashing-in-on-ais-power-crisis/,"The artificial intelligence (AI) boom is hitting a wall—not a digital one, but one made of concrete, copper, and cooling pipes. While investors have focused on the brilliant chip designers creating AI brains, the technology titans deploying these processors are facing a much more fundamental challenge. The sheer power consumption and immense heat generated by AI servers are straining data centers and the utility sector to their limits. This physical infrastructure challenge has quietly become the most significant bottleneck holding back the next wave of AI expansion, creating a new and essential investment category for those who provide the foundational solutions. Vertiv Holdings Company’s NYSE: VRT portfolio of products hits right at the core of the issue, which lies in the incredible density of modern AI systems. Thousands of powerful GPUs are packed tightly into server racks to achieve maximum performance. According to Vertiv’s CEO, Giordano Albertazzi, these configurations push rack power densities into the ""three- and four-digit kWs,"" a level of energy concentration that generates a thermal crisis. Traditional air-cooling methods, which involve blowing cold air across servers, are simply no match for this intensity. Without a more effective solution, these multibillion-dollar AI clusters cannot run at their full potential. This is the specific problem Vertiv is designed to solve. As a global leader in critical digital infrastructure, the company's offerings are non-negotiable requirements for the AI era. Recognizing that its customers' most significant challenge is deployment speed, Vertiv has moved beyond selling individual products to offering integrated solutions. Its recent launch of Vertiv OneCore is a prime example. This prefabricated, modular system allows a data center's entire power and cooling infrastructure to be built in a factory and deployed rapidly on-site, drastically cutting down construction timelines. Rack-specialist Great Lakes' planned acquisition further strengthens Vertiv’s strategic focus on integrated, turnkey solutions. This deal, expected to finalize in the third quarter of 2025, deepens Vertiv’s position as a one-stop shop for building the AI factories of the future. Vertiv’s strategic positioning at the heart of the AI build-out is generating impressive and tangible financial results. The company’s second-quarter 2025 earnings report provided a clear confirmation of its momentum, surpassing analyst estimates and demonstrating that the company is effectively converting surging demand into shareholder value. For investors tracking the company's progress, several key metrics stand out: This powerful performance gave management the confidence to raise its full-year 2025 guidance for key financial metrics, including net sales, adjusted earnings per share (EPS), and free cash flow. An upward revision of this nature signals to the market that company leadership sees a clear and sustainable growth path ahead. Following a year where Vertiv’s stock price has appreciated by over 95%, the company commands a premium valuation, with a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 67. This valuation reflects the market's belief that Vertiv is not just another industrial company but a critical and long-term enabler of the entire AI secular trend. Its growth is directly tied to one of a generation's most powerful technology shifts. Institutional experts share this bullish sentiment. A consensus of 22 Wall Street analysts rates the stock a Moderate Buy, and many have increased their price targets in the wake of the company's recent strong results. While the company did note temporary margin pressures from tariffs and the costs associated with scaling its manufacturing footprint to meet the demand surge, management laid out a clear action plan and expressed confidence that these operational headwinds will be ""materially resolved by year-end."" The company's financial forecast supports this, implying a strong margin recovery to over 23% in the fourth quarter, setting a positive trajectory for 2026. Ultimately, Vertiv's story is one of a company providing an indispensable solution to an industry's most pressing problem. Its role as a foundational enabler of the AI revolution, backed by strong execution and financial momentum, makes it a compelling pick-and-shovel investment for those looking to participate in the growth of the entire AI ecosystem.

A UFC fight at the White House? Dana White says it's happening as part of deal with Paramount,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/a-ufc-fight-at-the-white-house-dana-white-says-its-happening-as-part-of-deal-with-paramount-2025-08-12/,"Hours after Paramount and UFC announced a billion-dollar rights deal, Dana White said he had yet to hear from his friend, President Donald Trump, on his thoughts about the fight company’s new streaming home. That was fine with White. The UFC CEO was set to travel to Washington on Aug. 28 to meet with Trump and his daughter, Ivanka, to catch up and discuss logistics on the proposed Fourth of July fight card next year at the White House. Trump said last month he wanted to stage a UFC match on the White House grounds with upwards of 20,000 spectators to celebrate 250 years of American independence. “It’s absolutely going to happen,"" White told The Associated Press. “Think about that, the 250th birthday of the United States of America, the UFC will be on the White House south lawn live on CBS.” The idea of cage fights at the White House would have seemed improbable when the Fertitta brothers purchased UFC for $2 million in 2001 and put White in charge of the fledging fight promotion. White helped steer the company into a $4 billion sale in 2016 and broadcast rights deals with Fox and ESPN before landing owner TKO Group's richest one yet — a seven-year deal with Paramount starting in 2026 worth an average of $1.1 billion a year, with all cards on its streaming platform Paramount+ and select numbered events also set to simulcast on CBS. ESPN, Amazon and Netflix and other traditional sports broadcast players seemed more in play for UFC rights — White had previously hinted fights could air across different platforms — but Paramount was a serious contender from the start of the negotiating window. The Paramount and UFC deal came just days after Skydance and Paramount officially closed their $8 billion merger — kicking off the reign of a new entertainment giant after a contentious endeavor to get the transaction over the finish line. White said he was impressed with the vision Skydance CEO David Ellison had for the the global MMA leader early in contract talks and how those plans should blossom now that Ellison is chairman and CEO of Paramount. “When you talk about Paramount, you talk about David Ellison, they're brilliant businessmen, very aggressive, risk takers,” White said. “They're right up my alley. These are the kind of guys that I like to be in business with.” The $1.1 billion deals marks a notable jump from the roughly $550 million that ESPN paid each year for UFC coverage today. But UFC’s new home on Paramount will simplify offerings for fans — with all content set to be available on Paramount+ (which currently costs between $7.99 and $12.99 a month), rather than various pay-per-view fees. Paramount also said it intends to explore UFC rights outside the U.S. “as they become available in the future.” UFC matchmakers were set to meet this week to shape what White said would be a loaded debut Paramount card. The UFC boss noted it was still too early to discuss a potential main event for the White House fight night. “This is a 1-of-1 event,” White said. There are still some moving parts to UFC broadcasts and other television programming it has its hands in as the company moves into the Paramount era. White said there are still moving parts to the deal and that includes potentially finding new homes for “The Ultimate Fighter,” “Road To UFC,” and “Dana White’s Contender Series.” It's not necessarily a given the traditional 10 p.m. start time for what were the pay-per-view events would stand, especially on nights cards will also air on CBS. “We haven’t figured that out yet but we will,” White said. And what about the sometimes-contentious issue of fighter pay? Some established fighters have clauses in their contracts that they earn more money the higher the buyrate on their cards. Again, most of those issues are to-be-determined as UFC and Paramount settle in to the new deal — with $1.1 billion headed the fight company's way. “It will affect fighter pay, big time,” White said. “From deal-to-deal, fighter pay has grown, too. Every time we win, everybody wins.” Boxer Jake Paul wrote on social media the dying PPV model — which was overpriced for fights as UFC saw a decline in buys because of missing star power in many main events — should give the fighters an increased idea of their worth. “Every fighter in the UFC now has a clear picture of what the revenue is...no more PPV excuses,” Paul wrote. “Get your worth boys and girls.” White also scoffed at the idea that the traditional PPV model is dead. There are still UFC cards on pay-per-view the rest of the year through the end of the ESPN contract and White and Saudi Arabia have teamed to launch a new boxing venture that starts next year and could use a PPV home. White, though, is part of the promotional team for the Canelo Álvarez and Terence Crawford fight in September in Las Vegas that airs on Netflix. “It’s definitely not run it’s course,” White said. “There were guys out there who were interested in pay-per-view and there were guys out there that weren’t. Wherever we ended up, that’s what we’re going to roll with.” White said UFC archival footage “kills it” in repeat views and those classic bouts also needed a new home once the ESPN deal expires. Just when it seems there's little left for UFC to conquer, White says, there's always more. Why stop at becoming the biggest fight game in the world? Why not rewrite the pecking order in popularity and riches and go for No. 1 in all sports? “You have the NFL, the NBA, the UFC, and soccer globally,” White said. “We’re coming. We’re coming for all of them.” ___ AP sports: https://apnews.com/sports Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

MP Materials Stock Rides Rare Earth Boom to New Highs,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/mp-materials-stock-rides-rare-earth-boom-to-new-highs/,"Most investors would be wary of buying into a company that has yet to reach net profitability, though sometimes the macro narrative and the company-specific developments warrant a second look at some upside potential in this story. Today, one stock in the basic materials sector fits that description for several reasons. MP Materials Corp. NYSE: MP shares are trading near their 52-week highs for a good reason. Not only that, but this stock also has the potential to break into a new ceiling in the coming months and quarters, as the macro backdrop and rising investment interest make this stock a hot pick to keep in a growth portfolio. This is where investors can look beyond the pre-profit stage of this company and explore why it has seen such bullish price action. By delivering an aggressive run of 147% over the past month alone, some investors may wonder what could make this stock go higher even when operating at a loss, and whether this momentum will still be enough to deliver higher prices. Today, those doubts may as well wash away, because here’s why MP Materials is a stock investors want to keep around for a while. The United States has now gone on a trade tariff cycle, mainly focusing on Asia and the materials that come from the region. With this in mind, one of the items that has gotten the most attention in these tariff implementations is rare earth metals, used both in the defense and technology sectors of the United States. Given the United States' limited domestic sources of rare earth metals, those that have already demonstrated a successful case study are likely to receive the majority of government grants and favor, which is precisely where MP Materials stock comes into play. Digging into MP Materials' latest quarterly earnings report may help investors understand these current developments. Starting with the top line, MP Materials reported revenue growing to a high of $57.4 million during the quarter, or 84% higher than the same quarter last year. This revenue increase can be mainly credited to the record production of its materials, which reached 597 metric tons during the quarter, representing a massive 119% increase over the past 12 months. Some bears may say that this is a fluke of a quarter that may not repeat in the future. However, there is now evidence that that is not the case. This quarter may only suggest what could come for the future of MP Materials, especially now that new partnerships have been announced. The United States government, specifically the Department of Defense, has looked to MP Materials for answers. MP Materials will not only provide rare earth metals for defense purposes across the globe but also receive additional government support from the United States. After a significant investment over the past quarter, the Pentagon is now the largest shareholder in MP Materials. This is both a vote of confidence in the company’s ability to deliver on the demand needs for the United States defense, and also an ownership stake that guarantees only American interests are involved in management’s future decision-making and pivotal moves. Moreover, rare earth metals play a significant role in the current artificial intelligence race, particularly in areas related to semiconductors and chips. This is why Apple Inc. NASDAQ: AAPL also decided to join the Pentagon in this partnership bidding with MP Materials. Now investors have access to two of the biggest tailwinds happening in the global economy, both of which are now pushing MP Materials stock’s prospects higher. Knowing this, it shouldn’t surprise investors to see short sellers start to run away from this name. Over the past month, 8.3% of MP Materials’ short interest declined as a clear sign of bearish capitulation, but that’s not all. Considering that there are still $1.6 billion worth of open short positions in this stock, another rally like this one could force all these short sellers to close their positions at a loss, which involves buying back the stock for additional upward pressure.

Argentine leader Milei launches initiative to boost Israel-Latin America ties,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/argentine-leader-milei-launches-initiative-to-boost-israel-latin-america-ties-2025-08-12/,"TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Argentine President Javier Milei is helping to launch a $1 million initiative to improve diplomatic relations between Israel and several Latin American countries at a time when Israel is facing intense international criticism over its operations in Gaza. The Isaac Accords, funded by money from the Genesis Prize that Milei received two months ago in Jerusalem, will increase ties between Israel, Uruguay, Panama and Costa Rica, according to the Genesis Prize announcement on Tuesday. Argentina, under Milei, already has solid ties with Israel. His posture stands in contrast to most of Latin America — where Bolivia and Colombia have severed ties with Israel and other countries have recalled their ambassadors. The new initiative’s name is a nod to the Abraham Accords, which recognized bilateral relations between Israel and several Arab states starting in 2020, during U.S. President Donald Trump’s first administration. In 2026, the Isaac Accords plans to expand to Brazil, Colombia, Chile, and possibly El Salvador, according to the organizers, the American Friends of the Isaac Accords. Milei was awarded the Genesis Prize in Jerusalem on June 12 in recognition of his support for Israel, especially when many countries and international organizations, including the United Nations, have condemned Israel’s actions in Gaza. Milei is among the greatest supporters of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s right-wing government when it comes to world leaders, as Israel faces growing isolation over its bombardment and invasion of Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attacks on Oct. 7, 2023. Although born and raised Roman Catholic, Milei has increasingly shown public interest in Judaism and even expressed intentions to convert. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

AMD Paves Path for Market Share Gains: Stock Rally Has Just Begun,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/amd-paves-path-for-market-share-gains-stock-rally-has-just-begun/,"Advanced Micro Devices' NASDAQ: AMD share price is rebounding so strongly in 2025 because the outlook originally priced into the market in 2023/2024 has finally been affirmed. If you are wondering if its share price can continue to rise, the answer is yes. The outlook, tied to data centers and AI, includes the long-awaited market share gains that will come at the expense of NVIDIA NASDAQ: NVDA. NVIDIA, the undisputed leader in AI infrastructure today, secured its position due to its first-mover advantage. That advantage lies in its GPU semiconductor technology, the infrastructure to support parallel computing, and the capability to deliver solutions at rack scale. Those last two words, rack scale, truly matter; it is why NVIDIA commands roughly 90% of the market. The hyperscalers using NVIDIA and AMD GPUs to power their increasingly large and power-hungry data centers are using the GPUs by the tens of thousands, linked into clusters and racks by the thousands. You are not a solution if you can’t deliver solutions at scale. AMD's technology is arguably better, at least for some applications. The company’s focus on memory capacity, cost, and efficiency makes it well-suited for some higher-intensity AI workloads and inference, which is where AI is heading. Inference is the application of AI technology, the deployment of models and their use by businesses and consumers, and it will eventually be the bulk of AI workloads. AMD's disadvantage was its inability to deliver rack-scale solutions effectively, but that’s all changed.  Advanced Micro Devices has made great strides in fleshing out its AI stack, including the acquisition of ZT Systems and the Helios system. ZT Systems specializes in the development of designing and deploying AMD-based rack-scale solutions for data centers. Bringing it in-house allows AMD to provide an end-to-end, integrated solution based on Helios. Helios combines the soon-to-be-launched MI400 series with EPYC CPUs in an interconnected architecture geared for AI workloads. The platform is expected to be highly demanded by hyperscalers, including public, government, and commercial clouds. The forecast for 2026 is robust and includes an expectation for strength in all three of AMD’s critical segments. Already gaining market share in the datacenter CPU and PC segments, the analyst forecast significant market share gains compared to NVIDIA. Some suggest AMD could regain the share lost in 2023 and 2024 and then take more. The revenue and earnings forecasts are positive, with revisions in July and early August raising the consensus for sustained high-double-digit growth over the next five years. The critical detail is that the margin is expected to widen along the way, producing accelerated bottom-line growth and a deep-value relative to the long-term forecast. Trading at roughly 45x the current year’s earnings in mid-Q3 2025, AMD is trading at only 15x the 2035 forecast and could increase by 100% over the next ten years to trade in alignment with blue-chip technology peers. The analysts’ data reported by MarketBeat is bullish and aligns with the rising share price. The group rates the stock as a Moderate Buy. Coverage has been increasing, and the price target revisions are positive. Although the consensus implies the stock is fairly valued in early August, the revision trends lead to above $200, another 20% increase when reached. A move to $210 puts this market at a fresh weekly closing high, and a higher target may soon be set. The company has reportedly reached an accord with the White House, allowing it to resume sales of AI-related GPUs to China, a positive development for business and a catalyst for higher share prices.

YouTube to begin testing a new AI-powered age verification system in the U.S.,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/youtube-to-begin-testing-a-new-ai-powered-age-verification-system-in-the-us-2025-08-12/,"YouTube on Wednesday will begin testing a new age-verification system in the U.S. that relies on artificial intelligence to differentiate between adults and minors, based on the kinds of videos that they have been watching. The tests initially will only affect a sliver of YouTube's audience in the U.S., but it will likely become more pervasive if the system works as well at guessing viewers' ages as it does in other parts of the world. The system will only work when viewers are logged into their accounts, and it will make its age assessments regardless of the birth date a user might have entered upon signing up. If the system flags a logged-in viewer as being under 18, YouTube will impose the normal controls and restrictions that the site already uses as a way to prevent minors from watching videos and engaging in other behavior deemed inappropriate for that age. The safeguards include reminders to take a break from the screen, privacy warnings and restrictions on video recommendations. YouTube, which has been owned by Google for nearly 20 years, also doesn't show ads tailored to individual tastes if a viewer is under 18. If the system has inaccurately called out a viewer as a minor, the mistake can be corrected by showing YouTube a government-issued identification card, a credit card or a selfie. “YouTube was one of the first platforms to offer experiences designed specifically for young people, and we’re proud to again be at the forefront of introducing technology that allows us to deliver safety protections while preserving teen privacy,” James Beser, the video service's director of product management, wrote in a blog post about the age-verification system. People still will be able to watch YouTube videos without logging into an account, but viewing that way triggers an automatic block on some content without proof of age. The political pressure has been building on websites to do a better job of verifying ages to shield children from inappropriate content since late June when the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a Texas law aimed at preventing minors from watching pornography online. While some services, such as YouTube, have been stepping up their efforts to verify users' ages, others have contended that the responsibility should primarily fall upon the two main smartphone app stores run by Apple and Google — a position that those two technology powerhouses have resisted. Some digital rights groups, such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Center for Democracy & Technology, have raised concerns that age verification could infringe on personal privacy and violate First Amendment protections on free speech.
