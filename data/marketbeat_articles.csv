Here's how a major Mexican tomato exporter is affected by Trump’s 17% tariff,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/heres-how-a-major-mexican-tomato-exporter-is-affected-by-trumps-17-tariff-2025-07-26/,"AJUCHITLAN, Mexico (AP) — The Trump administration’s decision to impose a 17% duty on fresh tomatoes imported from Mexico has created a dilemma for the country providing more tomatoes to U.S. consumers than any other. The import tax that began July 14 is just the latest protectionist move by an administration that has threatened dozens of countries with tariffs, including its critical trading partner Mexico. It comes as the Mexican government tries to also negotiate its way out of a 30% general tariff scheduled to take effect Aug. 1. While the impacts of the tomato tariff are still in their infancy, a major grower and exporter in central Mexico shows how a tariff targeting a single product can destabilize the sector. Green tomato plants stretch upward row after row in sprawling high-tech greenhouses covering nearly six acres in the central state of Queretaro, among the top 10 tomato producing states in Mexico. Climate controlled and pest free, Veggie Prime’s greenhouses in Ajuchitlan send some 100 tons of fresh tomatoes every week to Mastronardi Produce. The Canadian company is the leading distributor of fresh tomatoes in the U.S. with clients that include Costco and Walmart. Moisés Atri, Veggie Prime’s export director, says they’ve been exporting tomatoes to the U.S. for 13 years and their substantial investment and the cost to produce their tomatoes won’t allow them to make any immediate changes. They’re also contractually obligated to sell everything they produce to Mastronardi until 2026. “None of us (producers) can afford it,"" Atri said. ""We have to approach our client to adjust the prices because we’re nowhere near making that kind of profit.” In the tariff’s first week, Veggie Prime ate the entire charge. In the second, its share of the new cost lowered when its client agreed to increase the price of their tomatoes by 10%. The 56-year-old Atri hopes that Mastronardi will eventually pass all of the tariff’s cost onto its retail clients. Experts say the tariff could cause a 5% to 10% drop in tomato exports, which last year amounted to more than $3 billion for Mexico. The Mexican Association of Tomato Producers says the industry generates some 500,000 jobs. Juan Carlos Anaya, director general of the consulting firm Grupo Consultor de Mercados Agrícolas, said a drop in tomato exports, which last year amounted to more than 2 billion tons, could lead to the loss of some 200,000 jobs When the Trump administration announced the tariff, the Commerce Department justified it as a measure to protect U.S. producers from artificially cheap Mexican imports. California and Florida growers that produce about 11 million tons would stand to benefit most, though most of that production is for processed tomatoes. Experts believe the U.S. would find it difficult to replace Mexico’s fresh tomato imports. Atri and other producers are waiting for a scheduled review of the measure in two months, when the U.S. heads into fall and fresh tomato production there begins to decline. In reaction to the tariff, the Mexican government has floated the idea of looking for other, more stable, international markets. Mexican Agriculture Secretary Julio Berdegué said Thursday that the government is looking at possibilities like Japan, but producers quickly cast doubt on that idea, noting the tomatoes would have to be sent by plane, raising the cost even more. Atri said the company is starting to experiment with peppers, to see if they would provide an option at scale. President Claudia Sheinbaum said recently her administration would survey tomato growers to figure out what support they need, especially small producers who are already feeling the effects of a drop of more than 10% in the price of tomatoes domestically over fears there will be a glut in Mexico.

Trump's meeting with a key European official comes as his tariff deadline nears,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trumps-meeting-with-a-key-european-official-comes-as-his-tariff-deadline-nears-2025-07-26/,"EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) — Donald Trump is meeting Sunday with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, taking a break from golfing in Scotland to discuss trade as both sides seek an agreement on tariff rates now that the White House's deadline to impose stiff tariff rates is looming. Trump played golf Saturday at his course in Turnberry on the southwest coast of Scotland and is expected to hit the links again frequently during his five-day visit. On Tuesday, he'll be in Aberdeen, in northeast Scotland, where his family has another golf course and is opening a third next month. Trump and his son Eric are planning to help cut the ribbon on the new course, where public tee times starting Aug. 13 are already on offer. The visit with von der Leyen is expected to be behind closed doors and few further details have been released. Leaving the White House on Friday, Trump said “we have a 50-50 chance, maybe less than that, but a 50-50 chance of making a deal with the EU.” He said the deal would have to “buy down” the currently scheduled tariff rate of 30% on the bloc of 27 member states. Later, von der Leyen posted on X that, “Following a good call” with Trump, the pair had ”agreed to meet in Scotland on Sunday to discuss transatlantic trade relations, and how we can keep them strong.” The U.S. and EU seemed close to reaching a deal earlier this month, but Trump instead threatened a 30% tariff rate on the bloc of nations. Still, Trump’s original deadline for beginning such tariffs has already passed, and is now delayed until at least Friday. Flying to Scotland to enjoy his golf courses hasn't stopped the president from talking trade. After going to Turnberry to play nine holes, have lunch, then play nine more, Trump posted that he'd block any trade deals between the U.S. and Cambodia and Thailand since the two southeast Asian countries remain locked in violent clashes in long-disputed border areas. Trump wrote that he spoke with Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet and Phumtham Wechayachai, the acting prime minister of Thailand, to call for a ceasefire. “I am trying to simplify a complex situation!” he wrote on Truth Social after disclosing his conversation with the Cambodian leader. After speaking with Wechayachai, Trump said both countries want peace and added: “Ceasefire, Peace, and Prosperity seems to be a natural.” The actual likelihood of a deal with the EU, meanwhile, remains to be seen. Trump recently said he thought the odds of reaching a framework with Japan was 25% — but the U.S. and Japan subsequently announced an agreement this past week. The president also bragged earlier in his term that he would leverage constant threats of steep U.S. tariffs around the globe to negotiate better rates and shrink trade deficits with some of Washington's key allies. But, so far, that effort has fallen well short of expectations, meaning the onus may be on Trump to be able to announce an agreement with a bloc as key to global commerce as the EU. Trump is also set to meet Monday in Scotland with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, after the two announced a trade framework in May and a larger agreement last month during the G7 in Canada. Trump says that deal is concluded and that the pair will discuss other matters — though the White House has suggested it still needs some polishing. Without an EU deal, the bloc said it was prepared to retaliate with tariffs on hundreds of American products, ranging from beef and auto parts to beer and Boeing airplanes. If Trump follows through on his threat of tariffs against Europe, it could make everything from French cheese and Italian leather goods to German electronics and Spanish pharmaceuticals more expensive in the U.S. Before you consider Boeing, you'll want to hear this.

Allianz Life confirms data breach affecting majority of 1.4M US customers,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/allianz-life-confirms-data-breach-affecting-majority-of-14m-us-customers-2025-07-26/,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Hackers gained access to personal data on the majority of the 1.4 million customers of Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America, the company confirmed Saturday. Minneapolis-based Allianz Life, a subsidiary of Munich, Germany-based Allianz SE, said the data breach happened on July 16 when a “malicious threat actor” gained access to a third-party, cloud-based system used by the company. “The threat actor was able to obtain personally identifiable data related to the majority of Allianz Life’s customers, financial professionals, and select Allianz Life employees, using a social engineering technique,” Allianz Life said in a statement. ""We took immediate action to contain and mitigate the issue and notified the FBI."" The company said its own systems were not accessed, just the third-party's platform. Allianz Life said its investigation is ongoing and that the company has begun reaching out to the impacted individuals. It said the incident involves only Allianz Life in the U.S., not other Allianz corporate entities. In the case of data breaches, a “social engineering technique” usually involves using trickery to gain access. Spokesman Brett Weinberg said he couldn't provide details because they are still investigating. Allianz Life also reported the breach to multiple other authorities, including the Maine Attorney General's Office. A filing on the agency's website said the company discovered the breach the day after it happened, and that it will be offering those affected 24 months of identity theft protection and credit monitoring. Allianz Life was known as North American Life and Casualty until it was acquired by German conglomerate Allianz SE in 1979 and changed its name to Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America. It has nearly 2,000 employees in U.S., with the majority working in Minnesota, according to its website. It is one of five North American subsidiaries of the Munich-based global financial services group Allianz SE, which says it serves more than 125 million customers worldwide.

The Tea app was intended to help women date safely. Then it got hacked,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/the-tea-app-was-intended-to-help-women-date-safely-then-it-got-hacked-2025-07-26/,"Tea, a provocative dating app designed to let women anonymously ask or warn each other about men they'd encountered, rocketed to the top spot on the U.S. Apple App Store this week. On Friday, the company behind the app confirmed it had been hacked: Thousands of images, including selfies, were leaked online. “We have engaged third-party cybersecurity experts and are working around the clock to secure our systems,” San Francisco-based Tea Dating Advice Inc. said in a statement. 404 Media, which earlier reported the breach, said it was 4Chan users who discovered an exposed database that “allowed anyone to access the material” from Tea. The app and the breach highlight the fraught nature of seeking romance in the age of social media. Here's what to know: Tea founder Sean Cook, a software engineer who previously worked at Salesforce and Shutterfly, says on the app's website that he founded the company in 2022 after witnessing his own mother's “terrifying'' experiences. Cook said they included unknowingly dating men with criminal records and being ”catfished'' — deceived by men using false identities. Tea markets itself as a safe way for women to anonymously vet men they might meet on dating apps such as Tinder or Bumble — ensuring that the men are who they say they are, not criminals and not already married or in a relationship. ""It's like people have their own little Yelp pages,'' said Aaron Minc, whose Cleveland firm, Minc Law, specializes in cases involving online defamation and harassment. In an Apple Store review, one woman wrote that she used a Tea search to investigate a man she'd begun talking to and discovered “over 20 red flags, including serious allegations like assault and recording women without their consent.'' She said she cut off communication. ”I can't imagine how things could've gone had I not known,"" she wrote. A surge in social media attention over the past week pushed Tea to the No. 1 spot on Apple's U.S. App Store as of July 24, according to Sensor Tower, a research firm. In the seven days from July 17-23, Tea downloads shot up 525% compared to the week before. Tea said in an Instagram post that it had reached 4 million users. A female columnist for The Times of London newspaper, who signed into the app, on Thursday called Tea a “man-shaming site'' and complained that ”this is simply vigilante justice, entirely reliant on the scruples of anonymous women. With Tea on the scene, what man would ever dare date a woman again?'' “Over the last couple of weeks, we’ve gotten hundreds of calls on it. It’s blown up,” attorney Minc said. ""People are upset. They're getting named. They’re getting shamed.’’ In 1996, Congress passed legislation protecting websites and apps from liability for things posted by their users. But the users can be sued for spreading ”false and defamatory'' information, Minc said. In May, however, a federal judge in Illinois threw out an invasion-of-privacy lawsuit by a man who’d been criticized by women in the Facebook chat group “Are We Dating the Same Guy,″ Bloomberg Law reported. State privacy laws could offer another avenue for bringing legal action against someone who posted your photograph or other personal information in a harmful way, Minc said. In its statement, Tea reported that about 72,000 images were leaked online, including 13,000 images of selfies or photo identification that users submitted during account verification. Another 59,000 images that were publicly viewable in the app from posts, comments and direct messages were also accessed, according to the company's statement. No email addresses or phone numbers were exposed, the company said, and the breach only affects users who signed up before February 2024. “At this time, there is no evidence to suggest that additional user data was affected. Protecting tea users’ privacy and data is our highest priority,” Tea said. It said users did not need to change their passwords or delete their accounts. ""All data has been secured.'' Lawyer Minc said he was not surprised to see Tea get targeted. “These sites get attacked,'' he said. ”They create enemies. They put targets on themselves where people want to go after them.'' .

"Comic-Con salutes James Gunn and gets first looks at 'Coyote vs. Acme,' and new 'Star Trek' forays",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/comic-con-goes-interstellar-with-project-hail-mary-star-trek-updates-2025-07-26/,"SAN DIEGO (AP) — Director James Gunn got an ovation from thousands for “Superman” in the most fitting place of all — Comic-Con. Among the highlights of day three of the San Diego pop culture spectacular was a sincere tribute to the director who's now helming Warner Bros.' DC Comics screen universe, even if John Cena played it for laughs. It came at a panel on the forthcoming Season 2 of DC's HBO series “The Peacemaker,” and Cena appeared in the title character's full comic costume and grand helmet, leading the legions in the kind of exaggerated drama he was perfect at provoking in his wrestling days. It was Gunn's first time in front of a crowd in the weeks since “Superman” was released and has earned more than $200 million in North America. “Today has been the most fun day I’ve had in a year,"" Gunn told the crowd at the end of the session. “Superman” was his first film as captain of the DC ship, but his first foray was in 2021's “The Suicide Squad,” which spawned the “Peacemaker” TV series. The crowd saw scenes from Season 2, which arrives in August and sees Cena entering another dimension where he gets to be a cool version of the hero instead of the often pained and pathetic version that's typical of the character. Some characters from “Superman” will make appearances. That panel followed another rousing showcase in Hall H, where star Ryan Gosling and directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller showed scenes from their forthcoming science-comedy space adventure “Project Hail Mary.” The scenes from the film set for release in March included a look at Rocky, a faceless, stone-shaped alien who becomes Gosling's unlikely partner in an attempt to save the universe from ecological disaster. Wile E. Coyote is getting his day in court — and theaters. The stars of “Coyote vs. Acme” delivered a rousing presentation Saturday morning of a movie that at one point wasn’t going to be released but is now bound for theaters in August 2026. The underdog story – both of the movie and Coyote — was a running theme of the panel. But rather than direct ire at Warner Bros., the real-world studio that shelved the project, the panel focused on the fictional Acme Corp. “This is purely an Acme decision … and I am saying this for legal purposes,” moderator Paul Scheer said at the start of the panel. The movie is a hybrid of animation and live action and is based on a 1990 New Yorker article that satirized a legal complaint filed by Coyote against Acme, the maker of the TNT, detonators, rocket shoes, catapults and other products that consistently backfire during the Coyote’s fruitless attempts to catch the Roadrunner. Laughter filled Hall H as some 6,000 watched a montage of Coyote being blown up, flattened and falling into chasms in a scene set to Johnny Cash’s cover of “Hurt.” Coyote is replaying the moments in his lair when an ad for a personal injury lawyer appears on TV. They also played six minutes of the movie, including a scene of opening statements in the case in which Coyote's lawyer, Will Forte, accidentally unleashes a rocket skate into the courtroom, setting Coyote and the judge's robes on fire. Cena plays a slick Acme lawyer who wins over the jury, which includes a cartoon character, quickly. Forte said he didn't think the movie would ever get to audiences. “I’m pretty speechless. You think back to the journey that this movie has taken. I had kind of given up hope at a certain point,” Forte said. At one point, his comments were interrupted by a man playing an Acme lawyer who stormed into Hall H with cease-and-desist letters. Director Dave Green said the movie conforms to famed animator Chuck Jones’ rules for the struggle between the Coyote and Roadrunner, which include the bird always staying on the road and the Coyote being ultimately more humiliated than hurt when he falls, is crushed or gets blown up by TNT. The movie, which features cameos from numerous Looney Tunes characters like Foghorn Leghorn, Tweety and Bugs Bunny, will be released on Aug. 28, 2026. Ketchup Entertainment teamed up with Warner Bros. on the film and in the release of “The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie.” Also on Saturday morning, the cast of “Bad Guys 2” teasing new footage from the movie and describing how they recorded their characters. Marc Maron, who plays Snake, joked he asked to be tied up as he performed his lines on the floor. “The depth of the character should read a little more this time,” he said. The film, based on the graphic novel series by Aaron Blabey, introduces a new crew of animal criminals, the Bad Girls played by Danielle Brooks, Natasha Lyonne and Maria Bakalova. Paramount showed off its first footage from a new series, “Starfleet Academy,” which stars Holly Hunter and Paul Giamatti. The show follows cadets as they go through training, with Hunter serving as chancellor of the academy. It will arrive in 2026, the 60th anniversary year of the original “Star Trek” series. Paramount+'s other “Star Trek” series, “Strange New Worlds,” also shared updates. The crew of the USS Enterprise are being turned into puppets for an upcoming “Strange New Worlds” episode, Paramount announced Saturday. The puppets will be created by Jim Henson's Creature Shop. Season 3, which follows the adventures of the Enterprise under the command of Capt. Christopher Pike, is being released on Paramount+. An estimated 135,000 people — many in costumes — are expected to attend Comic-Con 2025, which runs through Sunday in downtown San Diego. So far, fans have gotten previews of “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2,”the upcoming FX series “Alien: Earth” and “Predator: Badlands,” which will be in theaters in November.

Trump says Japan will invest $550 billion in US at his direction. It may not be a sure thing,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-says-japan-will-invest-550-billion-in-us-at-his-direction-it-may-not-be-a-sure-thing-2025-07-26/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is bragging that Japan has given him, as part of a new trade framework, $550 billion to invest in the United States. It's an astonishing figure, but still subject to negotiation and perhaps not the sure thing he's portraying. ""Japan is putting up $550 billion in order to lower their tariffs a little bit,"" Trump said Thursday. “They put up, as you could call it, seed money. Let’s call it seed money.” He said 90% of any profits from the money invested would go to the U.S. even if Japan had put up the funds. “It’s not a loan or anything, it’s a signing bonus,” the Republican president said, on the trade framework that lowered his threatened tariff from 25% to 15%, including on autos. A White House official said the terms are being negotiated and nothing has been formalized in writing. The official, who insisted on anonymity to detail the terms of the talks, suggested the goal was for the $550 billion fund to make investments at Trump's direction. The sum is significant: It would represent more than 10% of Japan's entire gross domestic product. The Japan External Trade Organization estimates that direct investment into the U.S. economy topped $780 billion in 2023. It is unclear the degree to which the $550 billion could represent new investment or flow into existing investment plans. What the trade framework announced Tuesday has achieved is a major talking point for the Trump administration. The president has claimed to have brought trillions of dollars in new investment into the U.S., though the impact of those commitments have yet to appear in the economic data for jobs, construction spending or manufacturing output. The framework also enabled Trump to say other countries are agreeing to have their goods taxed, even if some of the cost of those taxes are ultimately passed along to U.S. consumers. On the $550 billion, Japan's Cabinet Office said it involves the credit facility of state-affiliated financial institutions, such as Japan Bank for International Cooperation. Further details would be decided based on the progress of the investment deals. Japanese trade negotiator Ryosei Akazawa, upon returning to Japan, did not discuss the terms of the $550 billion investment. Akazawa said he believes a written joint statement is necessary, at least on working levels, to avoid differences. He is not thinking about a legally binding trade pact. The U.S. apparently released its version of the deal while Japanese officials were on their return flight home. “If we find differences of understanding, we may have to point them out and say ‘that’s not what we discussed,’” Akazawa said. The U.S. administration said the fund would be invested in critical minerals, pharmaceuticals, computer chips and shipbuilding, among other industries. It has said Japan will also buy 100 airplanes from Boeing and rice from U.S. farmers as part of the framework, which Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said would be evaluated every three months. “And if the president is unhappy, then they will boomerang back to the 25% tariff rates, both on cars and the rest of their products. And I can tell you that I think at 25, especially in cars, the Japanese economy doesn’t work,” Bessent told Fox News' “The Ingraham Angle.” Akazawa denied that Bessent’s quarterly review was part of the negotiations. “In my past eight trips to the United States during which I held talks with the president and the ministers,"" Akazawa said. “I have no recollection of discussing how we ensure the implementation of the latest agreement between Japan and the United States.” He said it would cause major disruptions to the economy and administrative processes if the rates first rise to 25% as scheduled on Aug. 1 and then drop to 15%. “We definitely want to avoid that and I believe that is the understanding shared by the U.S. side,” he said. On buying U.S. rice, Japanese officials have said they have no plans to raise the current 770,000-ton “minimum access” cap to import more from America. Agricultural Minister Shinjiro Koizumi said Japan will decide whether to increase U.S. rice imports and that Japan is not committed to a fixed quota. Trump's commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, has suggested that the Japanese agreement is putting pressure on other countries such as South Korea to strike deals with the U.S. Trump, who is traveling in Scotland, plans to meet on Sundayv with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to discuss trade. “Whatever Donald Trump wants to build, the Japanese will finance it for him,” Lutnick said Thursday on CNBC. “Pretty amazing.” ___ Yamaguchi reported from Tokyo.

"Modi joins Maldives independence day celebrations, signals easing tensions amid China rivalry",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/modi-joins-maldives-independence-day-celebrations-signals-easing-tensions-amid-china-rivalry-2025-07-26/,"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi Saturday participated Saturday in the 60th Independence Day celebrations of the Maldives, concluding a two-day visit to the island nation. During the trip, Modi also announced financial assistance and formally launched talks on a proposed free trade agreement. The two-day visit was seen as crucial to India’s ambition to control the seas and shipping routes of the Indian Ocean in a race with its regional rival China. It signaled a thaw in diplomatic tensions that followed the election of pro-China Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu in 2023. Modi joined a distinguished gathering at Republic Square in the capital, Malé, where a military parade and cultural performances marked the anniversary of the Maldives gaining independence from British rule in 1965. On Friday, following talks with Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu, Modi announced a credit line of $565 million to support development projects in the Maldives. The visit coincided with the anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between the two nations in 1965. It also saw the start of talks on a free trade agreement. The two leaders oversaw the exchange of signed agreements to cooperate in sectors such as fisheries, health, tourism and digital development. Modi also handed over dozens of heavy vehicles donated by India to strengthen the Maldives’ defense forces. The Maldives — an archipelago nation strategically located in the Indian Ocean — is a focal point in the growing geopolitical rivalry between India and China. Tensions grew when Muizzu, who favored closer ties with China, was elected in 2023 after defeating the India-friendly incumbent Ibrahim Mohamed Solih. Leading up to the election, Muizzu had promised to expel Indian soldiers deployed in the Maldives to help with humanitarian assistance. Last year New Delhi replaced dozens of its soldiers in the Maldives with civilian experts. Measures by Modi to promote tourism in India’s Lakshadweep archipelago, off the southwestern coast of the Indian mainland, also sparked anger from Maldivians, who saw it as a move to lure Indian tourists away from their country. Indian celebrities then called for a tourism boycott of the Maldives. Tensions escalated last year when President Muizzu visited China before India, a move widely interpreted in New Delhi as a diplomatic snub. On his return, Muizzu outlined plans to reduce the Maldives’ reliance on India for medical services, pharmaceuticals, and essential imports such as food staples. Relations started to improve after Muizzu attended Modi’s swearing-in ceremony for a third five-year term last year. Muizzu has since toned down his anti-Indian rhetoric, and official contacts with New Delhi have intensified amid growing concern about the Maldives’ economy. During a visit by Muizzu to India last October, India pledged financial support to the Maldives, which has been struggling with debt. This included $100 million in short-term government loans and agreeing to a $400 million currency swap to help stabilize the Maldivian economy. India has long been a key development partner for the Maldives. However, the island nation has also deepened ties with China, joining its Belt and Road Initiative in 2013 to build infrastructure and expand trade — part of Beijing’s broader effort to increase its global influence.

Crypto Skeptics Can Still Win Big With These Risk-Limiting ETFs,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/crypto-skeptics-can-still-win-big-with-these-risk-limiting-etfs/,"Fresh off all-time highs above $120,000, Bitcoin has had an incredible run in the last year with a price increase above 80%. The potential for a more favorable regulatory environment may have helped drive these gains and could also inspire once-cautious investors to take the crypto plunge. Still, there are plenty of reasons to be hesitant about cryptocurrency—volatility, user and programming risks for various exchanges and platforms, and security concerns are all still present, among other things. Investors hesitant to make direct, unprotected cryptocurrency investments but interested in the recent rally might consider a risk-limiting crypto ETF. Besides providing some insulation from the cryptocurrency itself by allowing exposure indirectly through shares of a fund, these vehicles may combine a crypto focus with something more stable from the traditional investment landscape. Further, all of the funds below have significantly outperformed the S&P 500 year-to-date (YTD), showing that these risk-mitigating strategies can still pay off. The Fidelity Crypto Industry and Digital Payments ETF NASDAQ: FDIG has been one of the better-performing crypto-adjacent ETFs in recent quarters. FDIG does not invest in cryptocurrency or related futures but rather holds a basket of stocks from both the U.S. and international markets. While many of these companies are involved in the cryptocurrency space—think of crypto exchanges like Coinbase Global Inc. NASDAQ: COIN and digital asset miners like MARA Holdings Inc. NASDAQ: MARA—others are more broadly centered around digital payments or blockchain, providing some alternate exposure. FDIG is reasonably diversified, with around 52 separate holdings that are spaced across the small-, mid-, and large-cap categories. Coinbase is the single largest security holding, but most other names are fairly evenly weighted. FDIG may appeal for its passive income potential, as it provides a dividend yield of 0.95%. This may help make the expense ratio of 0.40% even more compelling, despite the fact that it's already lower than many other crypto funds. FDIG has returned about 24% YTD, ahead of the S&P 500's 8.7% over the same period. An Ethereum-focused fund, the Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF NYSEARCA: AETH, aims to minimize the impact of volatility by using U.S. Treasuries during volatile periods. AETH is an actively managed fund that pivots between two different approaches: when fund managers believe momentum is strong, AETH holds exclusively CME Ether Futures, and when the market becomes volatile or uncertain, AETH shifts entirely to U.S. Treasuries. The fund's provider, Bitwise, asserts that a rotational strategy like this can outperform buy-and-hold crypto funds by capturing gains achieved during ether rallies while limiting downside risk during turbulent times. AETH's recent performance would suggest that this is accurate; the fund has a YTD return of 32.6%, while a traditional competitor investing solely in ether futures like the ARK 21Shares Active Ethereum Futures Strategy ETF NYSEARCA: ARKZ has returned just 7.7% in the same period. Investors should expect to spend more in fees for the active management component of AETH, which charges an expense ratio of 0.89%. ARKZ, by contrast, is somewhat lower at 0.70%. However, the added security of a Treasuries component—and the improved performance—may make AETH worth the higher cost. The One+One Bitcoin and Ether ETF NASDAQ: OOQB is a unique type of leveraged investment that offers both 100% Nasdaq-100 exposure and 100% Bitcoin exposure via futures. As a leveraged play, investors may wish to focus on short-term trades of OOQB. This fund provides an interesting mix of risk and risk mitigation. On one hand, a 2x leverage such as this is inherently higher-risk than traditional, non-leveraged ETFs. However, by balancing out Bitcoin futures exposure, typically seen as higher risk than traditional index-based funds, with a group of stalwart performers like those from the Nasdaq-100, OOQB offers some protection relative to a pure-play Bitcoin investment. OOQB is one of the newest cryptocurrency ETFs available, having only launched in February 2025. As such, a YTD performance metric is unavailable for this fund. However, in the last three months, it has returned more than 50%, with a relatively modest expense ratio of 0.85%. Keep in mind, though, as above, that the fund may not be intended for buy-and-hold investors but rather for those seeking targeted short-term exposure to Bitcoin with some protection from synchronous Nasdaq-100 access.

3 Discounted Steel Stocks You Can DCA Into Today,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/3-discounted-steel-stocks-you-can-dca-into-today/,"Most investors can agree that the industrial sector's current state is one of neglect, as most of the attention (and capital) has shifted to the more exciting stories in the artificial intelligence race in today’s market. This means that a potential rotation could be triggered in the future, no matter how vague this future may be. One of the best ways for investors to start exposing their portfolios to setups like these is to implement something called dollar-cost averaging (DCA). This means that investors will choose both a set date and amount to invest in a single name or a basket of names in an area like the industrial sector, which shows significant upside potential and a gap to fill. Of course, choosing the best names in this area can significantly improve the results of a DCA strategy, which is where names like Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. NYSE: CLF, Commercial Metals Co. NYSE: CMC, and even Steel Dynamics Inc. NASDAQ: STLD come into play. There are obvious reasons why investors should consider these stocks for their DCA basket, as they could offer the best of both safety and upside potential in the coming months. Considering the entire steel industry, all peers are trading at an average of 90% of their 52-week high prices. This is why Cleveland-Cliffs stock should be viewed as a potential catch-up play, as it is currently the outlier, trading at only 68% of its 52-week high. Next is the recently bullish view coming out of Wall Street, where Phillip Gibbs, an analyst from KeyCorp, decided to boost his rating on Cleveland-Cliffs stock from Sector Weight to Overweight. Not only did the sentiment improve for this stock, but its current perceived valuation also improved. This analyst decided to stand out of the pack and place a $14 per share price target on Cleveland-Cliffs stock, which, compared to today’s prices would mean not only flirting with 52-week high levels and closing that gap to peers, but also an approximate 40% upside potential for investors to expose their portfolios to in a DCA strategy. Another gauge to justify this view for Cleveland-Cliffs stock can be taken from what institutional buyers are doing with it. As of late July 2025, those from JB Capital decided to boost their holdings in the stock by 14.6% to net their position at $1.2 million. The fact that this isn’t the largest holding speaks to the current interest in slowly building a bigger position through DCA. Commercial Metals stock stands out due to its exposure to aluminum and steel production in the United States and China. This makes it an immediately valuable business opportunity that diversifies the ongoing risks and uncertainties stemming from the trade tariff negotiations between the two countries. Investors can expect big things from this fundamental setup, especially as Wall Street analysts now see the company reporting up to $1.25 in earnings per share (EPS) for the fourth quarter of 2025, in other words, a net increase of 70% from today’s reported $0.74 EPS. Now, most investors know that where EPS growth goes, so does the stock price, and this is why the entire market is now willing to pay up to 167.3x the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, a significant premium compared to the 109.3x average P/E for the materials sector today. Markets are often willing to overpay for names that they expect will outperform not only their peers but also the broader market. Commercial Metals stock's massive EPS growth and diversification between the United States and China justify a premium. As of mid-July 2025, Wall Street analysts seem to have figured out that Steel Dynamics stock is one of the clear winners in the steel industry. This might be why an analyst like Bill Peterson from J.P. Morgan Chase decided to boost his valuation target from $138 per share to a much higher $150 valuation. This new view implies that the stock could deliver up to 20% upside moves in the coming months and quarters, but like others, this one is also justified. Wall Street analysts also anticipate significant EPS growth in the coming quarters, with a target of $2.88 for the fourth quarter of 2025. Compared to today’s reported $2.01 in EPS, this suggests investors could be positioned for a 43% growth rate in earnings, which supports the double-digit upside potential seen in these valuation targets as well. This would make it another perfect candidate for starting a DCA strategy today for the coming quarters. Just as in the other names on this list, smart money has already started to apply this strategy, as those from Robeco Institutional Asset Management boosted their position in Steel Dynamics stock by 40.6% as of mid-July 2025 for a net holding of $214.5 million today, and another vote of confidence for this winner.

Could Baker Hughes Be an Unlikely Winner in Drone Defense Boom?,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/could-baker-hughes-be-an-unlikely-winner-in-drone-defense-boom/,"Baker Hughes NASDAQ: BKR won't be a name that comes to mind in the context of rising global defense budgets. However, the company’s recent earnings report shows why Baker Hughes may have an unrealized advantage as energy infrastructure, digital automation, and drone warfare become increasingly interconnected. Baker Hughes is best known as a provider of energy and oilfield services. That makes the company’s earnings and stock price sensitive to the price of oil and natural gas. A closer look at the company’s earnings report shows how it continues to transform itself into a technology-driven industrial player. Specifically, Baker Hughes is building adjacent capabilities in digital infrastructure, industrial AI, and process optimization. These are assets that could quietly align it with next-generation defense priorities. After the passage of the Trump administration’s “One Big, Beautiful Bill,” the U.S. defense budget for fiscal 2025 will exceed $900 billion. That dollar figure is impressive, but it’s where those dollars will be allocated that may be more significant to Baker Hughes. The U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) intends to make significant allocations toward unmanned systems (e.g., drones), energy resilience, and digital warfare. That has many investors looking to traditional defense contractors like Lockheed Martin Corp. NYSE: LMT and Northrop Grumman Corp. NYSE: NOC. However, to accomplish its objectives, the DOD will have to turn to industrial technology providers to source advanced capabilities in the energy space. This is where Baker Hughes may fit in. Like most energy stocks, Baker Hughes has had an “okay” year. BKR stock is up about 6.8% year-to-date. However, the stock jumped over 9.5% after its second quarter earnings report. A key factor was the company’s revenue of $6.8 billion, along with a 130-basis-point increase in operating margin. But what’s more revealing is where the growth is coming from. In short, Baker Hughes is not just about notoriously cyclical pumps and pipes. The company is pivoting into sensors, software, AI-driven diagnostics, and modular energy systems. It's important to emphasize that this isn’t happening today. However, there are reasons to believe Baker Hughes can fit into the Pentagon’s long-term plans. To understand this, it’s important to remember that drones are complex systems that require predictive maintenance, remote power systems, and AI-based monitoring and control systems. These are areas where Baker Hughes’ industrial tools could find crossover applications. For example: The company’s earnings presentation noted, “We continue to invest in technologies that support electrification and energy efficiency across industries.” Given that the U.S. Department of Defense increasingly awards contracts to tech-forward industrial partners, BKR could be on the shortlist for non-traditional support roles, especially in energy and logistics. From mid-June to mid-July, BKR stock formed an ascending triangle pattern. A breakout above resistance on strong earnings and volume confirms this bullish formation. With the sharp run-up after earnings, BKR stock has pushed well above its 50-day simple moving average. A bullish reversal in the MACD also supports the sharp move higher.  However, with an RSI above 80 as of this writing, BKR may be due for a short-term pullback. Even without the potential catalyst from defense contracts, Baker Hughes looks like a good value at this level. To begin with, even after the sharp post-earnings move, Baker Hughes is trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 16.8x. That’s slightly above the stock’s historical average, but it’s reasonable relative to the sector average. Furthermore, the company approved a $3 billion share repurchase authorization and pays a dividend with a 2.4% yield. Before you consider Baker Hughes, you'll want to hear this.

MarketBeat Week in Review – 07/21 - 07/25,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/marketbeat-week-in-review-07-21-07-25/,"Stocks were up this week as the summer rally continues. There was mixed news from the tech sector this week, but on the whole, earnings have been better-than-expected. That trend will likely continue when many mega-cap technology stocks report next week. Continued capital expenditures in artificial intelligence are likely to be bullish for the sector. Another big story this week was the finalization of a trade deal between the United States and Japan. However, tariff uncertainty still lingers, particularly with the Trump administration’s August 1 deadline looming. There’s a lot to be sorted out that could move markets. Next week will be an important week for economic data. The Federal Reserve will issue its next decision on interest rates on Wednesday. The expectation is for no change in interest rates, but investors will look for any signal that a cut is coming in September. However, the bigger market mover may come from the July Jobs report on Friday. Articles by Thomas Hughes As important as AI is to investors today, Thomas Hughes wrote this week that Physical AI is the real endgame for this technology. However, that endgame is already taking shape, and Hughes gave investors five physical AI stocks that investors could buy today and hold for triple-digit returns. Turning his attention to value stocks, Hughes analyzed the earnings report from Verizon Communications, Inc. NYSE: VZ. The stock is known for its high-yield dividend, but Hughes explained why VZ stock is a solid growth opportunity after its bullish report. Congressional trading activity has become a topic of keen interest to investors. This week, Hughes highlighted the five stocks with the most Congressional selling in the year's first half and explained why you may or may not want to follow their lead. Articles by Sam Quirke Tesla Inc. NASDAQ: TSLA stock was down sharply after the company’s earnings report, in which chief executive officer (CEO) Elon Musk warned that the next two quarters could be challenging. Sam Quirke broke down the report and explained why analysts are playing the long game as traders move out of the stock. Qualcomm Inc. NASDAQ: QCOM is one of the more undervalued semiconductor stocks. Quirke noted that a recent price target hike and the company’s upcoming earnings report may mean the rally in QCOM stock is just getting started. On the other end of the value spectrum, Amazon.com Inc. NASDAQ: AMZN stock has rallied toward its February high. However, Quirke pointed out that the stock now comes with a relatively high valuation. That means investors may need a strong earnings report to push the stock higher. Articles by Chris Markoch Palantir Technologies Inc. NASDAQ: PLTR continues to outperform the broader market in 2025. However, Chris Markoch highlighted the sentiment shift between technical indicators and options activity. This could make PLTR stock more volatile than usual heading into its earnings report in early August. Many consumer discretionary stocks continue to underperform the market. However, that’s not the case for three streaming stocks. All three are moving lower after hitting an all-time high, but Markoch explained why each could reverse that trend with solid earnings. Markoch also introduced MarketBeat’s new FDA Events Tool and highlighted three small-cap biotech stocks with critical upcoming catalysts that could give investors a good reason to accumulate shares for future growth. Articles by Ryan Hasson All good things must come to an end. As Ryan Hasson wrote this week, that’s the general sentiment around the recent pullback in Rocket Lab USA Inc. NASDAQ: RKLB stock. The stock is down double digits from its parabolic move to an all-time high, but Hasson notes that technical and fundamental factors support the long-term bull case, which could make this a time to buy the dip. Alphabet Inc. NASDAQ: GOOGL stock has been lagging its Magnificent Seven counterparts this year. However, Hasson explained why that may change after the company crushed its earnings report and answered some key questions about the health of its search, cloud computing, and AI businesses. Investors may notice that risk-on sentiment is starting to run rampant. Hasson noted that impulse could be good for investors with room for speculative stocks in their portfolio. This week, Hasson analyzed five high-risk/high-reward stocks that are showing strong momentum. Articles by Gabriel Osorio-Mazilli The latest cryptocurrency rally started with Bitcoin surging to an all-time high. However, Gabriel Osorio-Mazilli explained to investors that the real opportunity may be in these three stocks that are bringing Bitcoin to the broader market. A sharp move higher in several stocks has some analysts believing meme stock mania is back. However, when it comes to the surge in Opendoor Technologies Inc. NASDAQ: OPEN, Osorio-Mazilli highlighted some key fundamental reasons that make the stock more than a retail play. Enthusiasm over the buildout of an AI infrastructure is reaching a fever pitch. Osorio-Mazilli explained why that is bullish for Super Micro Computer Inc. NASDAQ: SMCI. Institutional investors have moved beyond the accounting irregularities from earlier this year and are now leading the stock higher. Articles by Leo Miller A key theme in the tech sector is how one company’s growth plans positively impact another company’s stock. Leo Miller gave investors an example of that this week. Miller explained why Meta Platform Inc. NASDAQ: META's plans to invest in “titan cluster” data centers are a game-changer for Broadcom Inc. NASDAQ: AVGO stock. The quantum computing space continues to evolve quickly. This week, Miller highlighted the recent surge in Rigetti Computing Inc. NASDAQ: RGTI stock, being fueled by the company’s decision to take a step back to make a strong move forward. When companies raise their guidance, analysts typically begin raising their price targets. That combination is always bullish for a stock in the long term. This week, Miller pointed investors to four stocks receiving higher price targets fresh off of raised guidance in their earnings reports. Articles by Nathan Reiff This week, Nathan Reiff analyzed the recent surge in shares of D-Wave Quantum Inc. NYSE: QBTS. The stock appeared to be moving higher in concert with other quantum computing stocks. However, with no specific catalyst for the spike, Reiff reminded investors that, while QBTS stock looks promising, caution should be the watchword as profitability remains elusive. Companies are sometimes punished when an earnings report is only “good enough.” Reiff explained why that appears to be the case with three stocks that are down despite solid, but not spectacular, reports. This can be where long-term investors should pay attention to analysts upgrading these stocks, which could signal a buy-the-dip opportunity. Despite the continued interest in high-growth technology stocks, Reiff pointed out that investors looking for passive income and growth through dividend stocks haven’t been disappointed. That’s particularly true if they own one of the three high-yield dividend payers that carry some risk, but offer the chance of a market-beating reward. Articles by Dan Schmidt “Is China investable again?” Dan Schmidt attempted to answer this week. Schmidt noted that with trade tensions easing, three large-cap Chinese stocks are starting to look good for value investors. Robinhood Markets Inc. NASDAQ: HOOD has been one of the best-performing stocks in 2025. This week, Schmidt pointed out a small line item in the One Big, Beautiful Bill that will make the stock more attractive to professional sports bettors looking to reduce their tax burden. Articles by Jeffrey Neal Johnson Many MarketBeat analysts wrote about specific quantum computing stocks this week. Jeffrey Neal Johnson compiled much of that information to explain what catalysts are pushing three quantum computing stocks higher this summer. Johnson also wrote about the recent price spike in AST Spacemobile Inc. NASDAQ: ASTS after a recent contract announcement. Analysts haven’t jumped on board yet, but Johnson reminded investors that this could be one time when being early is just fine. The U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) has $900 billion to put to use. However, as Johnson wrote this week, it won’t be business as usual, which is good news for investors in Kratos Defense & Security Solutions Inc. NASDAQ: KTOS. Articles by Jordan Chussler Investing in AI and data centers doesn’t have to be exclusive to growth investors. This week, Jordan Chussler highlighted Iron Mountain Inc. NYSE: IRM, which operates as a real estate investment trust (REIT) in the data center space. Chussler explained why the company’s fundamentals suggest the stock could be an undervalued gem for buy-and-hold value investors. Speaking of value investors, many such investors walked away from AT&T Inc. NYSE: T after it cut its dividend in 2022. However, Chussler explained why recent legislation is likely to be bullish for the company’s fundamentals, and institutional buyers are starting to take notice.

US-China trade talks: Can China reduce its export dependence?,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/us-china-trade-talks-can-china-reduce-its-export-dependence-2025-07-26/,"BEIJING (AP) — China’s high dependence on exports will likely be a key focus of a new round of U.S.-China trade talks this coming week in Stockholm, but a trade deal would not necessarily help Beijing to rebalance its economy. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said he hopes the negotiations can take up this issue, along with China's purchases of oil from Russia and Iran, which undercut American sanctions on those two countries. Hopes rose for a breakthrough in talks after U.S. President Donald Trump announced deals with Japan, Indonesia and the Philippines this week. The U.S. wants China to do two things: Reduce what both the U.S. and the European Union see as excess production capacity in many industries, including steel and electric vehicles. And secondly, to take steps to increase spending by Chinese consumers so the economy relies more on domestic demand and less on exports. “We could also discuss the elephant in the room, which is this great rebalancing that the Chinese need to do,” Bessent told financial news network CNBC. He said China's share of global manufacturing exports at nearly 30%, “can’t get any bigger, and it should probably shrink.” The issues are not new, and China has been working to address them for years, more for domestic reasons than to reduce its trade surpluses with the U.S. and other countries. Bessent's predecessor as treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, made industrial policy a focus of a trip to China last year. She blamed government subsidies for flooding the global market with “artificially cheap Chinese products.” The European Union, whose top leaders met their Chinese counterparts in Beijing on Thursday, has cited subsidies to justify EU tariffs on electric vehicles made in China. In the 1980s, the U.S. pressured Japan to boost consumer spending when American manufacturing was overwhelmed by exports from the likes of Toyota and Sony. Economists have long argued that China likewise needs to transform into a more consumer-driven economy. Consumer spending accounts for less than 40% of China’s economy, versus close to 70% in the United States and about 54% in Japan. Chinese leaders have spoken about both factory overcapacity and weak consumer spending as long-term problems and have sought over the past 20 years to find ways to rebalance the economy away from export manufacturing and massive investments in dams, roads, railways and other infrastructure. Fierce price wars have prompted critical reports in official media saying that companies are “racing to the bottom,” skimping on quality and even safety to reduce costs. With strong government support, they've also expanded overseas, where they can charge higher prices but still undercut local competitors, creating a political backlash. All that competition and price cutting has left China battling deflation, or falling prices. When companies receive less for their products, they tend to invest less. That can lead to job cuts and lower wages, sapping business activity and spending power — contrary to the long-term goal of increasing the share of consumer spending in driving overall growth. To counter that, the government is spending billions on rebates and subsidies for people who trade in their cars or appliances for new ones. But acknowledging a problem and solving it are two different things. Economists say more fundamental changes are needed to boost consumption and rein in overcapacity. Such changes can only come incrementally over time. Private Chinese companies and foreign-invested companies create the most jobs, but they've suffered from swings in policy and pressures from the trade war, especially since the pandemic. Demographic changes are another challenge as China's population shrinks and ages. Many experts advocate expanding China's social safety net, health insurance, pensions and other support systems, so that people would feel freer to spend rather than save for a medical emergency or retirement. Yan Se, an economist at Peking University's Guanghua School of Management, warned at a recent forum that deflation will become a long-term issue if China doesn't step up its welfare benefits. “Chinese people deserve a better life,"" he said. One possibility, put forward at the same forum by Liu Qiao, the dean of the business school, would be to change incentives for local government officials, rewarding them for raising consumption or household incomes instead of meeting an economic growth target. He doesn't see that happening nationwide but said it could be tested in a province. “That would send out a message that China needs a different approach,” he said. Chinese leader Xi Jinping has made transforming the country into a technology superpower a top priority. It's a goal that has gained urgency as the U.S. has tightened restrictions on China's access to high-end semiconductors and other advanced knowhow. Output in high-tech manufacturing is growing quickly, adding to potential overcapacity, just as what happened with the government's encouragement of “green” technologies such as solar panels and wind turbines. Various industries, including EV makers, have pledged to address the issue, but some local governments are striving to keep money-losing enterprises afloat, reluctant to lose tax revenues and jobs, or to fail to meet economic growth targets. Going forward, the government is calling for more coordination of economic development polices in fields such as artificial intelligence so that not every province champions the same industry. But government moves to counter the impact of higher tariffs tend to support sectors already in overcapacity, and the share of consumption in the economy has fallen in recent years. “A sustained improvement in household consumption will require greater reform ambition,” the World Bank said in its most recent update on China's economy."" ___ AP Business Writer Elaine Kurtenbach in Bangkok contributed to this report.

Policy officially takes over for Murphy as president/CEO at Packers' shareholders meeting,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/policy-officially-takes-over-for-murphy-as-presidentceo-at-packers-shareholders-meeting-2025-07-25/,"GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) — Ed Policy began his tenure as the Green Bay Packers’ president/CEO by paying tribute to his predecessor. Policy officially took over for Mark Murphy on Friday as the NFL’s only publicly owned franchise held its annual shareholders meeting. During Murphy’s 17 seasons on the job, the Packers made 13 playoff appearances, with the 2010 team winning a Super Bowl. “I assure you that going forward I’m going to lean heavily on your example and your pearls of wisdom as I move the organization into the future,” Policy said. Murphy is stepping down because he reached the franchise’s mandatory retirement age of 70 earlier this month. Murphy said he felt he could continue meeting the demands of this position but added that he agrees with the Packers’ retirement policy. “In my career – business and with the league and others – you see examples where maybe people stay on a little too long, so I think this serves the Packers well,” Murphy said. Policy, 54, didn’t focus much on his own plans during the shareholders meeting, which instead pretty much served as a testimonial for Murphy. There were plenty of shouts of “Thank you, Mark,” among the 6,529 shareholders in the Lambeau Field stands. On a hot afternoon, many shareholders tried to cool themselves off by waving fans that featured Murphy’s face. A tribute video included messages from NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and former commissioner Paul Tagliabue among others. Murphy signed autographs and greeted fans after the Packers’ Friday morning practice and again after the shareholders meeting. “It’s a little bittersweet,” Murphy said. “Obviously, I’m a very appreciative and I also feel honored, too, that the fans have been so supportive of me and the organization. But (I’m) really excited too for the future of the organization and for Ed in particular.” The Packers say Murphy, who played defensive back for Washington from 1977-84, is believed to be the only person to earn a Super Bowl ring both as a player and as a team’s chief executive. He was on Washington’s 1982 championship team. His stint as Green Bay’s president/CEO included the construction of Titletown, a 45-acre development adjacent to Lambeau Field that features shops, restaurants and apartments. He capped his tenure earlier this year by welcoming the NFL Draft to Green Bay, an event that drew an announced three-day total attendance of 600,000. Murphy also presided over multiple renovations to Lambeau Field, including the opening of a new home locker room this week. “He’s been tremendous for us,” wide receiver Jayden Reed said. “I thanked him today, knowing this was his last day here, so I went up to him and I thanked him for everything. Without him, we wouldn’t be standing in this locker room right now. He’s been a tremendous help to all of us, very supportive. He gets this thing done. I appreciate him for that.” Murphy said he hopes to stay involved in the game and noted that he’s talked to Goodell about things he’d like to do on a league level. He also mentioned spending more time with his family and increasing his involvement in his charity work and in the golf course he owns at Baileys Harbor, Wisconsin. The Packers’ board of directors unanimously selected Policy as Murphy’s replacement after a search committee recommended him last year. Policy, the son of former San Francisco 49ers and Cleveland Browns president, joined the Packers as vice president and general counsel in August 2012 and was promoted to chief operating officer in January 2018. “I want to thank you, our owners, for investing so much in me over the past 13 years,” Policy told the shareholders. “It’s been really special, and I intend to pay it back with results both on and off the field.” Packers coach Matt LaFleur, general manager Brian Gutekunst and executive vice president/director of player operations Russ Ball report to the president/CEO under the team’s leadership structure. All three of them have two years remaining on their contracts. Policy said earlier this year he has no plans to extend those contracts before this season, though he praised all three men and noted his long working relationships with them. “(I’m) certainly going to miss Mark and everything that he’s done for this place, but feel like we’re in great hands with a guy like Ed Policy,” LaFleur said. Murphy was asked what advice he had for Policy. “The one thing I told him is he’s got to be himself,” Murphy said. “I’ve seen him grow quite a bit as a leader. The search ended up with him. They did a great job. There’s no question he’s positioned and ready to have success. “He and I have talked about it. Don’t be afraid to change things. Follow your instincts. He’s got really good business sense. Hopefully we put him in a position where he can have success not only in the short term but the long term of the organization.” NOTES: LaFleur said OL Aaron Banks is “day to day” with a back issue. … Rookie WR Savion Williams didn’t practice Friday due to a concussion. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

Paramount gets green light for $8 billion merger. But what is the psychic cost for company?,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/paramount-gets-green-light-for-8-billion-merger-but-what-is-the-psychic-cost-for-company-2025-07-25/,"With this week’s FCC approval, the merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media is expected to be completed in the coming weeks at a value of $8 billion. The question for the new company is whether the psychic cost is much higher. It has been a particularly rough few months at Paramount-owned CBS, where the settlement of a lawsuit regarding “60 Minutes” and announced end of Stephen Colbert's late-night show has led critics to suggest corporate leaders were bowing to President Donald Trump. Following the Federal Communications Commission approval Thursday, one of the triumvirate of current Paramount leaders, Chris McCarthy, said that he would be leaving the company. McCarthy has been in charge of fading cable properties like MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon, expected to bear the brunt of an estimated $2 billion in cost cuts identified by Skydance leaders. Skydance head David Ellison is expected to head the new company, and he has identified former NBC Universal executive Jeff Shell as the incoming president. After the merger's Aug. 7 closing date, the new leaders will be watched most closely for how they deal with CBS News, particularly given the $16 million paid in a settlement of Trump's complaint that last fall's “60 Minutes” interview was edited to make opponent Kamala Harris look good. Two news executives — News CEO Wendy McMahon and “60 Minutes” executive producer Bill Owens — resigned due to their opposition to the deal. The appointment of respected insider Tanya Simon to replace Owens this week was seen as a positive sign by people at “60 Minutes.” Days before the FCC's vote, Paramount agreed to hire an ombudsman at CBS News with the mission of investigating complaints of political bias. “In all respects, Skydance will ensure that CBS's reporting is fair, unbiased, and fact-based,” Skydance said in a letter to FCC Chairman Brendan Carr. The role of an ombudsman, or public editor, who examines a news outlet's work is often positive — if they are given independence, said Kelly McBride, an ethics expert who has had that role at NPR for five years. “You really want the person to have loyalty only to their own judgment and the journalistic mission of the organization,” she said. Having the sole mission of examining bias could be problematic, however. To be fair, a journalist's work should be closely studied before making that determination, not judged on the basis of one report or passage, she said. Carr, in an interview with CNBC on Friday, said the role “should go a long way toward restoring America's trust in media.” Anna Gomez, an FCC commissioner who voted to reject the deal on Thursday, interpreted the arrangement as a way for the government to control journalists. “They want the news media to report on them in a positive light or in the light that they want,” Gomez told MSNBC. “So they don't want the media to do their job, which is to hold government to account without fear or favor.” According to published reports, Ellison has explored purchasing The Free Press, a flourishing news site founded by Bari Weiss perhaps best known for a former NPR editor's study of liberal bias in public broadcasting. An Ellison spokeswoman did not return a message seeking comment on Friday. Colbert's slow-motion firing — he'll work until the end of his contract next May — was described by CBS as a financial decision given late-night television's collapsing economics. Colbert's relentless lampooning of Trump, and his criticism of the “60 Minutes” settlement, led to suspicion of those motives. “Was this really financial?” comic Jon Stewart wondered. ""Or maybe the path of least resistance for your $8 billion merger was killing a show that you know rankled a fragile and vengeful president?” Stewart's profane criticism on his own Paramount-owned show may provide its own test for Skydance. “The Daily Show” is one of the few original programs left on Comedy Central, and his contract ends later this year. In an odd way, Comedy Central's “South Park” buttresses CBS' claim that the Colbert decision was financial, not political. Creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone delivered an episode this week that depicted a naked Trump in bed with the devil. Paramount just signed Parker and Stone to a new $1.5 billion deal that Skydance executives surely cleared; it makes the entire “South Park” library available for streaming on Paramount+. a platform where Colbert's show doesn't do nearly as well. Figuring out what to do with others at Paramount's cable networks, or even the networks as a whole, will be an early decision for Ellison, son of multibillionaire and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison. “There is a clear opportunity to improve Paramount's growth profile by letting those assets go,” analyst Doug Creutz of TD Securities told investors Friday. “On the other hand, we suspect the Ellisons did not purchase Paramount in order to break it up for parts.” The merger also brings together the Paramount movie studio with one of its most regular partners. David Ellison has been one of the industry's top investors and producers since founding Skydance in 2006. Ellison has a challenge here, too: Years of uncertainty over its future and modest investment in its movie pipeline has shrunk Paramount's market share to last among the major studios. The Paramount+ streaming service has been a money-loser. To revive Paramount, Ellison will look to revamp its streaming operations, leverage its franchises and try to bolster family content. ___ AP Film Writer Jake Coyle contributed to this report.

"Tea, an app for women to safely talk about men they date, has been breached, user IDs exposed",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/tea-an-app-for-women-to-safely-talk-about-men-they-date-has-been-breached-user-ids-exposed-2025-07-25/,"Tea, an app designed to let women safely discuss men they date has been breached, with thousands of selfies and photo IDs of users exposed, the company confirmed on Friday. Tea said that about 72,000 images were leaked online, including 13,000 images of selfies or selfies featuring a photo identification that users submitted during account verification. Another 59,000 images publicly viewable in the app from posts, comments and direct messages were also accessed without authorization, according to a Tea spokesperson. No email addresses or phone numbers were accessed, the company said, and the breach only affects users who signed up before February 2024. “Tea has engaged third-party cybersecurity experts and are working around the clock to secure its systems,” the company said. “At this time, there is no evidence to suggest that additional user data was affected. Protecting tea users’ privacy and data is their highest priority.” Tea presents itself as a safe way for women to anonymously vet men they might connect with on dating apps such as Tinder or Bumble — ensuring that your date is “safe, not a catfish, and not in a relationship.” “Tea is a must-have app, helping women avoid red flags before the first date with dating advice, and showing them who’s really behind the profile of the person they’re dating,” reads Tea's app store description. 404 Media, which earlier reported the breach, said it was 4Chan users who discovered an exposed database that “allowed anyone to access the material"" from Tea. “While reporting this story, a URL the 4chan user posted included a voluminous list of specific attachments associated with the Tea app. 404 Media saw this list of files. In the last hour or so, that page was locked down, and now returns a “Permission denied” error,” 404 Media reported Friday. Tea said in an Instagram post this week that it has reached 4 million users. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

3 Stocks Flying Under the S&P 500 Radar,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/3-stocks-flying-under-the-s-and-p-500-radar/,"The S&P 500 is the benchmark index used by most investors. In fact, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust NYSEARCA: SPY is one of the most widely held index funds for passive investors. Investing in the SPY has been a good strategy in the last few years as mega-cap technology stocks dominated the market. This had the added benefit of giving investors exposure to themes like industrial automation, artificial intelligence (AI), and semiconductors. However, as the market rally broadens into other sectors, focusing only on those names can introduce investors to more risk and less reward than they may think. The SPY is a market-cap weighted index, which means it will buy the stocks with the highest market capitalizations, independent of any other fundamentals. As of July 24, its two largest holdings are NVIDIA Corp. NASDAQ: NVDA and Microsoft Corp. NASDAQ: MSFT. The good news is that investors benefit from the positive momentum in these stocks. However, that growth comes at a premium, and investors may not capture faster-growing stocks. Investors looking to diversify their portfolio should consider the opportunities in small-cap and international stocks. These can offer higher growth potential, especially at the beginning of a long-term innovation cycle like what is happening with AI. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are an emerging story. Companies such as Tesla Inc. NASDAQ: TSLA and Alphabet Inc. NASDAQ: GOOGL have launched fleets of their robotaxis and Waymo AVs in select markets around the world. Now, the question is one of scale. In the case of Waymo, that will mean LiDAR technology. Investors see that opportunity in a company like Aeva Technologies Inc. NASDAQ: AEVA. With a market cap of $1.3 billion, it’s not the biggest name in the LiDAR space. However, the company differentiates itself with a 4D LiDAR system that measures distance and velocity using a unique Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) technology. The ability to measure velocity is a key advancement in LiDAR technology and allows Aeva to notch several contracts in the autonomous vehicle space in 2025. This is not contributing to revenue yet, but investors are looking past that. AEVA stock is up 401% in 2025. In June and July, analysts from Roth Capital and Oppenheimer raised their price targets on the stock. However, the stock is down 20% in the last month suggesting that short interest over 17% is weighing on the stock. Ouster Inc. NYSE: OUST is an example of why there’s enough room in the autonomous vehicle space for several competitors. In the case of Ouster, it’s not how the company is executing on LiDAR technology; it’s where. Ouster is focusing on defense, robotics, and industrial automation markets. In June, the company’s digital LiDAR was approved by the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) for unmanned aircraft. This aligns with the Pentagon's plans to use the increased defense spending coming after the One Big, Beautiful Bill passed through Congress. However, the revenue from these projects will take time to be realized. That’s why investors may need to wait for a better entry point. As of this writing, OUST stock is up approximately 126% in 2025 and over 258% in the last three months. It’s well above its consensus price target as animal spirits are taking over the market. Nevertheless, the company’s upcoming earnings in August could give the bulls the upper hand. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing NYSE: TSM is hardly a small-cap company. With a market cap of over $1.25 trillion, the Taiwan-based chip foundry is one of the largest companies in the chip sector. It’s also one of the best-performing stocks and has room to run. A key reason for investors to believe in the company’s growth is its contracts with Apple Inc. NASDAQ: AAPL, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. NASDAQ: AMD and NVIDIA. With few competitors to threaten its leadership, Taiwan Semiconductor will continue to be at the heart of chip manufacturing. TSM stock is up 22% in 2025, but the focus is likely on what’s next. The company delivered a strong earnings report on July 17 with revenue up 50% year-over-year (YOY) and earnings per share (EPS) up 66% YOY. Institutional investors continue to invest in the company despite geopolitical concerns, fueling the stock's bullish outlook.

Qualcomm's Next Gear: A Growth Story Wall Street Might Be Missing,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/qualcomms-next-gear-a-growth-story-wall-street-might-be-missing/,"Qualcomm NASDAQ: QCOM heads into its third-quarter earnings report on July 30, and Wall Street will be watching closely. For years, the company has served as a key indicator for the health of the mobile industry, with its fortunes closely tied to smartphone sales. However, investors who focus only on handset numbers risk missing a fundamental and exciting transformation. A multi-year strategy to diversify the business is now bearing significant fruit. Qualcomm is aggressively expanding into high-growth sectors, building a more resilient company that is less dependent on the cyclical smartphone market. This successful pivot is creating a compelling new investment case centered on the future of automotive technology, artificial intelligence (AI) powered PCs, and the vast possibilities of the Internet of Things (IoT). One of the clearest signs of Qualcomm’s evolution is its accelerating growth in the automotive industry. This segment is quickly becoming a primary engine for the company, delivering impressive financial results and building a foundation for long-term, predictable revenue. In its second fiscal quarter, Qualcomm's automotive revenues reached $959 million, representing a remarkable 59% increase from the same period last year. The Snapdragon Digital Chassis platform drives this growth. It is a comprehensive suite of solutions that automakers use to power digital cockpits, in-car connectivity, and Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS). This platform approach makes Qualcomm an essential technology partner in the modern software-defined vehicle. To further secure its position, Qualcomm completed its acquisition of Autotalks in June 2025. This move integrates industry-leading Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication technology into its portfolio, a cornerstone for future autonomous driving and road safety systems. For investors, these long-term automotive design wins provide a stable and growing revenue stream, directly offsetting the volatility of the consumer phone market and supporting the company's goal of achieving $8 billion in annual automotive revenue. Qualcomm's expansion goes well beyond the car. The company’s IoT segment, which grew 27% year-over-year to $1.6 billion in Q2, has become a launchpad for entering new device categories, most notably the AI PC. With its Snapdragon X Elite processors, Qualcomm has emerged as a serious competitor in a market long dominated by legacy players. These chips offer key advantages in power efficiency and on-device AI processing, enabling a new generation of laptops with multi-day battery life. This is already translating into market share. In the first calendar quarter of 2025, Snapdragon-powered devices captured approximately 9% of the premium Windows laptop market in the U.S. and key European countries. Qualcomm's vision for the intelligent edge is also pushing into the data center. The company's recently announced plan to acquire Alphawave Semi OTCMKTS: AWEVF for approximately $2.4 billion provides critical high-speed connectivity technology, accelerating its expansion into a massive, high-margin market driven by global demand for AI. This, combined with new partnerships in industrial IoT, shows a clear strategy: to make Qualcomm's technology a fundamental part of the connected economy. For investors looking to validate this growth story, the upcoming earnings report offers a clear opportunity. Beyond the headline numbers, these specific metrics will signal if the diversification strategy is maintaining its powerful momentum: Qualcomm's successful pivot is reinforcing its financial strength and commitment to rewarding investors. With a trailing price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of approximately 16, the stock’s valuation suggests that the market may not yet be fully pricing in these durable, high-growth revenue streams. Wall Street is taking note, with a consensus 12-month analyst price target near $185, implying a potential upside of over 15% from its current price. Management is signaling its confidence through its actions. The company offers a healthy dividend yielding around 2.25% and has committed to returning 100% of its free cash flow to shareholders in fiscal 2025. This is a powerful statement of belief in the long-term cash-generating power of its new ventures. Qualcomm’s strategic execution has set it on a clear path to becoming a more balanced and diversified technology leader. While its legacy is in mobile, its future is being built in our cars, on our desks, and across the intelligent enterprise. The upcoming earnings report will be another key checkpoint in a compelling long-term growth story that is just getting started. Before you consider QUALCOMM, you'll want to hear this.

Continuous glucose monitors are in vogue. But do you really need to track your blood sugar?,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/continuous-glucose-monitors-are-in-vogue-but-do-you-really-need-to-track-your-blood-sugar-2025-07-26/,"A quarter-size device that tracks the rise and fall of sugar in your blood is the latest source of hope — and hype — in the growing buzz around wearable health technology. Continuous glucose monitors, small patches that provide 24-hour insight into concentrations of sugar in the blood, could be a tool for Americans to “take control over their own health,” Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently told federal lawmakers. “They can take responsibility,” Kennedy said. “They can begin to make good judgments about their diet, about their physical activity, about the way they live their lives.” The devices have lifesaving benefits for people with diabetes, the disease caused when blood sugar remains high because their bodies don't make enough insulin or become resistant to it. The condition, which affects more than 38 million people in the U.S., raises the risk of serious health problems such as heart and kidney disease and vision loss. But the devices have surged in popularity among people without diabetes. Sales have been driven by high-profile marketers such as Casey Means, the nominee for U.S. surgeon general. There’s scant evidence the monitors are useful for people with normal blood sugar levels, said Dr. Jody Dushay, an endocrine specialist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Healthy bodies can effectively regulate glucose after meals and provide the energy they need to function. Glucose monitors may lead people to misinterpret normal swings in blood sugar that happen after eating or activity. In addition, the devices can be “notoriously inaccurate,” providing misleading readings, she said. “The problem with wearing these is that you can just be zooming in on and creating pathology when it’s not there,” Dushay said. Here’s what you need to know about the devices: The device is a small patch, about the size of two stacked quarters, usually placed on the upper arm or stomach. It uses a needle to painlessly pierce the skin for a tiny sensor. The sensor measures the glucose in fluid under the skin, delivering a signal every few minutes to a phone app or a handheld display. The apps typically record blood sugar levels and help people track the foods they eat and how they impact those levels. When healthy people eat a meal that contains carbohydrates, their blood sugar rises, peaks and falls in response to the food. A healthy fasting blood glucose level for a person without diabetes is roughly 70 milligrams per deciliter to 99 milligrams per deciliter. A range from 100 to 126 milligrams per deciliter indicates prediabetes and above 126 milligrams per deciliter indicates diabetes, according to the American Diabetes Association. In adults without diabetes, blood sugar levels can climb to 140 milligrams per deciliter or more within an hour of a meal, before falling back to baseline levels within two or three hours, according to the association. It's a sign the body is processing sugar normally. For decades, these devices were available only for people with diabetes. The monitors revolutionized care by allowing more precise adjustment of insulin used to treat diabetes and giving people the ability to modify meals and activity more accurately. Last year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first over-the-counter monitors. Since then, many companies have emerged to market them, claiming to provide intensive, individualized health monitoring. Cost is generally about $100 a month. They’ve really caught on with consumers curious about how food and activity affect their blood sugar levels. For instance, Noom, the weight-loss and fitness app, launched a blood glucose feature last year that has proven extremely popular, said Alexander Fabry, a company executive. “Of the people who are using a CGM, the vast majority of them don’t have a diabetes diagnosis,” he said. The devices have been lifesaving for people with diabetes. And they can be helpful for people with risk factors for the disease, including obesity, prediabetes, a history of gestational diabetes or a family history of the condition. The devices can allow users to see how specific food and activity choices affect their blood sugar in near real-time, said Dr. Alaina Vidmar, a pediatric obesity specialist at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles. “After a large meal, you may watch your blood sugar go up and sort of learn something about yourself,” Vidmar said. “For example, I drink a sugar-sweetened soda and my blood sugar goes up really high, really fast. And maybe I don't feel as good, right?” People without risk factors for diabetes may turn to the monitors just because they’re curious, said Dr. David Kessler. A former FDA commissioner, Kessler doesn’t have diabetes, but he wore a monitor for a couple months during research for his recent book, “Diet, Drugs and Dopamine.” “I think it’s a very interesting tool to experiment with if you’re so inclined,” Kessler said. But, he noted, the devices can’t be used to diagnose or treat disease. Even experts don't agree on how to interpret or provide health advice for people without diabetes based on blood sugar data. “No one knows what’s optimal in the nondiabetic state,” he said. Before using a monitor, Dushay asks patients to consider their motives. “What do you think you're going to get from the data?” she said. “What is to be gained from wearing that monitor?” ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

3 Cloud Build-Out Stocks Behind the AI Infrastructure Boom,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/3-cloud-build-out-stocks-behind-the-ai-infrastructure-boom/,"Investors continue to invest in technology stocks, particularly those with an artificial intelligence (AI) theme. However, for some investors, their choice of stocks to buy may be based on FOMO (fear of missing out) rather than allowing a deeper understanding of what’s happening in the tech space to inform their investment decisions. One area to consider is how cloud computing is changing. The idea of accessing data and running applications via the internet, as opposed to local computers and servers, is over 20 years old. However, it’s evolving fast to meet the needs of AI. This boils down to infrastructure. Data centers have been around for decades. However, generative (and now agentic) AI and machine learning require more of everything (power, cooling, network speed, and density). In many cases, hyperscalers like Microsoft Corp. NASDAQ: MSFT, Amazon.com Inc. NASDAQ: AMZN and Meta Platforms Inc. NASDAQ: META can’t just retrofit existing data centers. They have to be created from the ground up. This is the “cloud build-out,"" and it will take years and billions in capital expenditures to make it a reality. That's an investable theme every investor can understand and profit from today. Here are three companies supplying the building blocks of this new infrastructure. The case for Prologis Inc. NYSE: PLD is easy to understand. The first step in building a next-generation data center is finding land with power access and necessary permitting. Prologis is the global leader in logistics real estate. In its latest earnings report, Prologis announced a shift in focus to data centers and AI infrastructure hubs. The company is repurposing logistics-adjacent land and buying new property in power-rich areas that will support the needs of hyperscalers. PLD stock is up 4.1% in 2025 and continues to consolidate following its earnings on July 16. Analysts have a consensus price target of $119.67, which could provide an additional 8.75% upside in addition to a dividend yield of 3.67%. Plus, at 16x forward earnings, the company is attractively valued compared to its historical averages. Putting NVIDIA Corp. NASDAQ: NVDA seems too easy. However, NVIDIA provides a good starting point for looking at Super Micro Computer Inc. NASDAQ: SMCI. The company designs and builds high-performance server and storage systems tailored for AI, cloud, and enterprise computing. This includes NVIDIA GPUs, which are the current gold standard for generative AI workloads. Super Micro is growing rapidly with triple-digit revenue growth in recent quarters. There is growing speculation that Meta Platforms, Inc. NASDAQ: META will award Super Micro a contract to provide cooling services for its new data centers. This is a pure-play picks-and-shovels stock for the hardware that the cloud buildout will require. SMCI stock is up 69% in 2025, but investors should note that it is expensive to itself at around 27x forward earnings. Analysts give the stock a consensus price target of $42.89, which is 17% below its closing price on July 23. Just like many specialists (electricians, plumbers, painters) are needed to construct a house, the same is true of data centers. Super Micro provides the compute layer, but Arista Networks Inc. NYSE: ANET provides the networking layer. This includes the high-speed networking equipment that allows servers to communicate with each other. Arista already has contracts with companies such as Meta Platforms and Microsoft, making it the logical choice for these next-generation data centers. That positioning shows up in the company’s financials: Arista has high operating margins, a strong balance sheet, and consistent profitability. ANET stock has increased 59% in the last three months. That’s not surprising given the billions of dollars in capital expenditures announced by the hyperscalers during that time. More importantly, analysts are raising their price targets for the stock ahead of the company’s earnings in early August. Before you consider Arista Networks, you'll want to hear this.

The company behind Ugg boots and Hoka shoes reported stronger profit and revenue than analysts expected. That helped offset a sharp drop for Intel, which sank 8.5% after saying it would cut thousands of jobs as it tries to turn around its struggling fortunes.

Beer and food workers on strike at Fenway Park for homestand between Dodgers and Red Sox,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/beer-and-food-workers-on-strike-at-fenway-for-homestand-between-dodgers-and-red-sox-2025-07-25/,"BOSTON (AP) — Striking Fenway Park vendors banged on drums and shouted “Don't buy food!” while walking a picket line outside the home of the Boston Red Sox before Friday night's game against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Hundreds of Aramark workers marched along the street behind the team's right field concourse before the series opener, carrying round picket signs decorated with red baseball stitching. A giant inflatable rat shared the sidewalk with a statue of Red Sox greats Ted Williams, Bobby Doerr, Dom DiMaggio and Johnny Pesky. Another group of picketers circled behind home plate after the first pitch as Local 26 of the Massachusetts and Rhode Island hotel, casino, airport and food services workers union went on strike at noon on Friday. It posted on social media that it is asking for “living wages, guardrails on technology and R-E-S-P-E-C-T!” It's believed to be the first union walkout in the ballpark's 113-year-history. “Respect the picket line,"" the union posted. “We know tix are expensive, we’re not asking you to stay away from the home games. But we ARE asking you to not buy concessions. No purchase of pretzels, pickles or peanuts inside the ballpark during the homestand.” An Aramark spokesman said the company has bargained in good faith and is “disappointed the union rejected our latest offer and chose to call a strike.” “We are committed to delivering an outstanding fan experience and have contingency plans in place to ensure fans will not encounter service interruptions,” the company said. The Red Sox noted that the team was not involved in the negotiations but remained in contact with the concessionaire. Aramark made an offer as recently as Thursday night that was rejected by the union, the team said. “Aramark has implemented its contingency staffing plans, and fans can expect a full and uninterrupted ballpark experience this weekend, including access to all food, beverage, and hospitality services throughout Fenway Park,” the team said. ""We remain hopeful that the parties will reach a swift and fair resolution.” A Red Sox spokeswoman said after Friday night's game, a full house of 36,369, that “ballpark concessions performed at the expected levels consistent with tonight’s sold out crowd.” U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders called on the team to support the vendors. “Fenway Park is an iconic American institution, and it’s the workers there that make every Red Sox game special,” he posted on social media. “The team is extremely profitable. They should treat their employees with respect, pay them decent wages and negotiate a fair contract with the union.” Maggie McCue, a beer vendor with 19 years of experience who is 24 weeks pregnant with twins, took a break from marching in the near-90 degree temperatures to eat a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Her mother, also a beer vendor for almost two decades, said the team can afford for the workers to be paid a living wage. “They have more money than they need,” Marianne McCue said. “We are Fenway. Fenway is us. Some people have been here 40-something years and they're not even backing us up. Shame on them. I never thought that at 70 years old I would be on strike, but here we are."" The Red Sox play three games against the Dodgers before leaving town again for a series beginning Monday night in Minneapolis against the Twins. It was a chance for Boston fans to welcome back ex-Red Sox star Mookie Betts, who was traded to Los Angeles in a cost-cutting move a year after winning the AL MVP. Now, with Betts returning to town, the vendors are looking to get paid. “It's come full circle,” Maggie McCue said. “Full circle.” ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

Pakistan urges global social media platforms to block accounts run by banned militant groups,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/pakistan-urges-global-social-media-platforms-to-block-accounts-run-by-banned-militant-groups-2025-07-25/,"ISLAMABAD (AP) — Pakistan on Friday urged global social media companies to take action to block hundreds of accounts allegedly run by outlawed militant groups that Islamabad claims spread propaganda and glorify insurgents in the South Asian country. According to Pakistan’s Deputy Interior Minister Talal Chaudhry, groups such as the Pakistani Taliban and the separatist Balochistan Liberation Army — banned by the Pakistani authorities and also designated as terrorist groups by the United States — have been using X, Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Telegram to promote violence in Pakistan. Chaudhry, who spoke to reporters at a news conference, urged the tech companies to remove or disable these accounts, as well as those run by supporters of the militant groups. Deputy Law Minister Aqeel Malik, who also spoke at the new conference, said Pakistani investigators have identified 481 accounts associated with the Pakistani Taliban, known as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan or TTP, and the Balochistan Liberation Army, or BLA. The accounts were being used to incite violence and spread hate speech, Malik said. There was no immediate response from any of the social media platforms to Pakistan's request. Pakistan itself has in recent years blocked access to X, primarily to curb criticism from supporters of imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan but also voices of other dissenters. The plea comes amid a surge in violence across Pakistan, much of it blamed on the two militant groups, as well as the Islamic State group. The Pakistani Taliban are allies but a separate militant group from the Afghan Taliban. However, the Taliban takeover of neighboring Afghanistan in 2021 has emboldened the TTP. Militant groups also heavily rely on social media platforms to claim responsibility for attacks against security forces and civilians in Pakistan.

Education Department says it will release billions in remaining withheld grant money for schools,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/education-department-says-it-will-release-billions-in-remaining-withheld-grant-money-for-schools-2025-07-25/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is releasing billions of dollars in withheld grants for schools, the Education Department said Friday, ending weeks of uncertainty for educators around the country who rely on the money for English language instruction, adult literacy, and other programs. President Donald Trump's administration had suspended more than $6 billion in funding on July 1, as part of a review to ensure spending aligned with the White House’s priorities. The funding freeze had been challenged by several lawsuits as educators, Congress members from both parties and others called for the administration to release the money. Congress had appropriated the money in a bill signed this year by Trump. Last week, the Education Department said it would release $1.3 billion of the money for after-school and summer programming. Without the money, school districts and nonprofits such as the YMCA and Boys and Girls Club of America had said they would have to close or scale back educational offerings this fall. The Office of Management and Budget had completed its review of the programs and will begin sending the money to states next week, the Education Department said. A group of 10 Republican senators on July 16 sent a letter imploring the administration to allow the frozen education money to be sent to states, saying the withheld money supported programs and services that are critical to local communities. “The programs are ones that enjoy longstanding, bipartisan support,” U.S. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., said Friday. She pointed to after-school and summer programs that allow parents to work while their children learn and classes that help adults gain new skills — contributing to local economies. In withholding the funds, the Office of Management and Budget had said some of the programs supported a “ radical leftwing agenda. ” “We share your concern,” the GOP senators had written. “However, we do not believe that is happening with these funds.” School superintendents had warned they would have to eliminate academic services without the money. On Friday, AASA, an association of superintendents, thanked members of Congress for pressing to release the money. In Harford County, Maryland, some of the withheld federal money made up more than half the budget for the district’s annual summer camp for kids learning English. The money helps the district hire certified teachers to staff the camp, incorporating learning into children's play for four weeks during the summer. The program helps kids keep their English and academic momentum over the summer. The district serves roughly 1,100 students who are non-native English speakers. Many of them are born in the U.S. to parents who came to the area seeking job opportunities, often in the restaurants and warehouses that have popped up in the past decades in the region northeast of Baltimore. During the school year, the soon-to-be-released federal money pays for tutors for kids learning English. On Thursday, more than 350 children filled the second floor of Bel Air High School for the second-to-last day of summer camp. Young learners crowded around an alphabet wheel, jostling with each other to push each letter button as they thought of foods starting with letters from A to Z. Middle school students watched a robotics team demonstration, and a few sheepishly raised their hands when asked if they would be interested in joining. High school student volunteers, some of whom had been campers learning English themselves not many years ago, helped the youngest children with art projects. The uncertainty around the funding was an unnecessary distraction for schools, said U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wa. “Instead of spending the last many weeks figuring out how to improve after-school options and get our kids’ reading and math scores up, because of President Trump, communities across the country have been forced to spend their time cutting back on tutoring options and sorting out how many teachers they will have to lay off,"" Murray said. The grants that were under review included $2 billion for teachers’ professional development and efforts to reduce class size; $1 billion for academic enrichment grants, often used for science and math education and accelerated learning; $890 million for students who are learning English; $376 million to educate the children of migrant workers; and $715 million to teach adults how to read. It added up to millions of dollars for the nation’s largest school districts. Data available from the Census for three of the grant programs — teacher development, academic enrichment, and bilingual education — shows the Los Angeles Unified School District, for example, received $62 million in the 2022-23 school year. Philadelphia’s school district got $28 million, while Miami’s got over $24 million. Smaller districts got more modest amounts, but they still would have represented sizable gaps in their budgets. For example, schools in Burlington, Vermont; Pine Bluff, Arkansas; and Norristown, Pennsylvania, each got more than $300 per student from the same three grant programs. ___ Associated Press writer Sharon Lurye in Philadelphia contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press’ education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

ServiceNow: The 2nd Wave of AI Spending Is Here,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/servicenow-the-2nd-wave-of-ai-spending-is-here/,"ServiceNow’s NYSE: NOW Q2 results and guidance update are a wow moment for investors and an eye-opener for those waiting on AI’s second wave. The second wave, the rise of agentic services and the application of AI, is expected to be a larger, faster-growing, and longer-sustained rally than infrastructure, which has been a rocket-ship of gains for technology investors. The takeaway today is that ServiceNow’s results outperformed guidance and analysts' consensus forecasts in all metrics. Guidance was improved to align with them, and the momentum indicates that outperformance is very likely. ServiceNow had a robust quarter considering its size. The megacap grew its revenue by 22.4% to over $3.2 billion, outperforming MarketBeat’s reported consensus by more than 300 basis points. The strength was driven by subscriptions and large clients, with subscription revenue up 22.5% and clients contributing more than $20 million in contract value, up 30%. Margin news is also good, with revenue leverage compounded by internal efficiency. The net result is that adjusted EPS grew by 30% compared to the 22.4% top-line growth and outperformed by an eye-popping margin. Outperformance topped 1450 basis points, and the strength is expected to continue in Q3 and the remainder of the year. The company raised its guidance for Q3, underpinning expectations for a strong year, forecasting about 20% growth compared to the prior year. The guidance is likely cautious, given the 22.4% top-line growth, accelerating deal volume, and improving quality, as well as the RPO, which outpaces revenue. The current remaining performance obligation is up 24.5%, and the total is up 29%, suggesting sustained, if not accelerating, growth as the year progresses. ServiceNow’s business is profitable, and it generates free cash flow. A portion is used to buy back shares, which is insufficient to offset dilution, but almost, and the remainder is for reinvestment. As of the end of Q2 2025, the company’s efforts resulted in increased cash and assets, steady net debt, low leverage, and increased equity. Equity improved by 13% YTD and will likely continue to grow as the year progresses. Regarding leverage, the company utilizes debt but has an investment-grade rating, resulting in relatively low costs. The net leverage in Q3 is about 0.1x the equity, which is a healthy ratio. Analysts are leading this market higher, providing support with increasing coverage, a firming sentiment, a Moderate Buy rating, and an uptrend in the consensus price target. The price target is a critical factor, having risen by more than 30% in the last year, with revisions leading to a high-end range. The high-end range is $1,300, affirmed by the post-release activity, which includes several price target increases issued within the first twelve hours. Likewise, the institutional trends are bullish. They own 87% of the stock and buy on balance every month in 2025, netting about $2 in shares for every $1 sold. ServiceNow’s stock price surged in the wake of the release but struggled to break through resistance at the top of the near-term range. Resistance at $1,050 may keep this market in check soon, but long-term trends suggest it won’t. Once crossed, the next target is near $1,150, and it may be reached quickly. Assuming that subsequent earnings reports align with the new guidance, analyst trends will remain bullish. New highs will be set, potentially reaching as high as the $1,300 level, representing a 30% gain.  Before you consider ServiceNow, you'll want to hear this.

Tractor Supply Revs Up on Forecast Hike and Bullish Signals,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/tractor-supply-revs-up-on-forecast-hike-and-bullish-signals/,"Tractor Supply Company’s NASDAQ: TSCO FQ2 earnings report affirmed the outlook for long-term share price increases, as indicated by the recent stock split. Due to their quality, stocks that split tend to trend higher over time, outperforming the broader market. Stock splits tend to happen with stocks whose prices have been trending higher to begin with. Uptrends are driven by business growth and improving shareholder value, so it only makes sense that the uptrend will continue afterward. Tractor Supply Company's uptrend is tied to store count growth, market penetration, and share gains as it leans into its Life Out Here strategy. Life Out Here serves underserved, less urbanized markets where the larger big-box stores are largely absent. Like other retailers, the company faces hurdles in 2025, but is navigating the environment effectively, generating ample cash flow to sustain its growth trajectory, maintain a healthy balance sheet, and return capital.  Capital return is a critical factor for this investment. TSCO stock is a buy-and-hold investment whose price action is supported by numerous factors, none of which tend to produce vigorous share price increases; rather, it exhibits steady share price growth over time. They include steady, stable, profitable business growth, an attractive dividend with an annually increasing distribution, and share repurchases. The dividend is safe and reliable, accounting for 45% of the earnings outlook, and is on track for robust annual increases. The distribution growth rate isn’t robust but is sustainable in the mid-to-low single-digit range and outpacing inflation. The share repurchases are significant. The company tempered its outlook for buybacks, reducing the annual forecast slightly in mid-July 2025, but it remains on track to purchase up to $375 million, a sustainable pace. The full-year forecast is worth approximately 1.1% of the pre-release market closing market cap, a solid pace but slower than the 1.6% decline posted for the June quarter. Tractor Supply Company’s analyst trends were bullish leading into the release and are likely to continue strongly in the back half. They included numerous price target increases, leading to the high-end range, aiding a 15% split-adjusted YOY increase in MarketBeat’s reported consensus and providing lift for the market. The consensus estimate lags in early Q3 but is rising, and the high-end range is leading to new highs. The company achieved 4.5% revenue growth, outperforming the market by 100 basis points. It maintained strong margins and updated its guidance. Executives expect revenue growth of 4% to 8%, a wide range but one whose midpoint is well above the 4.7% consensus. Regarding earnings, the company also forecasted a wide range with a midpoint above the consensus. Following the release, the price action in TSCO was bullish, rising by more than 4% to a new high. The move reveals ample support within an eager market, with the trading set to hit its potential to continue higher. The move to new highs broke the market out of a trading range worth approximately $13, which puts the base-case target in the $74.50 to $75 range. It could be reached this year. The longer-term outlook is also bullish. The company remains on track to expand its store count and improve comparable sales over time. The analyst consensus forecasts mid-to-high single-digit revenue growth and high-single-digit to low-double-digit earnings growth for the subsequent nine years. This puts TSCO at roughly 11.5x its earnings outlook and in deep value territory. Before you consider Tractor Supply, you'll want to hear this.

3 Short Squeeze Candidates With Big Catalysts on the Horizon,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/3-short-squeeze-candidates-with-big-catalysts-on-the-horizon/,"In 2021, a new presidential administration took shape while meme stocks and short squeezes sent markets into a frenzy. In 2025, another new presidential administration is taking shape, while meme stocks and short squeezes again send markets into a frenzy. While history doesn’t always repeat, we might see it rhyme as obscure small-cap stocks produce parabolic gains on a wave of retail volume. The names are different (and it’s Superman leading the box office this time over Spider-Man), but it might be time to dust off the short squeeze trading playbook and consider a few lottery tickets. Hunting short squeezes is risky since these stocks are often thinly traded and highly volatile. Before buying any of the three stocks discussed here today, make sure this strategy fits with your investment goals. Short squeeze candidates are often terrible-looking investments at face value—that’s why so many investors are shorting! You don’t short profitable winners like NVIDIA Corp. NASDAQ: NVDA; instead, you short movie chains struggling to remain solvent, like AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. NYSE: AMC, or unprofitable tech firms, like Opendoor Technologies Inc. NASDAQ: OPEN. The idea behind a short squeeze isn’t a good long-term investment, but a quick parabolic gain as shorts race to cover. That’s why traders don’t look at fundamentals, but factors like these: Most heavily-shorted stocks don’t produce a squeeze, which is why finding a catalyst is a crucial part of due diligence. Nostalgia has drawn the AMC and GameStop crowds, but there needs to be a genuine reason for a reversal when hunting squeezes (as Gabriel highlights here for Opendoor). Here are three more candidates with high short interest and upcoming catalysts to keep on your radar. Shorting stocks in the semiconductor space is a bold decision considering the AI gold rush, but Navitas Semiconductor Corp. NASDAQ: NVTS currently sports 32% short interest on its 134 million share float. Shorts control about $385 million of the stock’s $1.72 billion market cap, which makes sense considering the company only generated $83 million in sales over the last 12 months and continues to post negative EPS. The company's Q1 revenue dropped nearly 40% year over year (YOY), but it did meet analyst expectations. The Q2 report is scheduled for August 4, and while expectations are low, an upside surprise could be the catalyst needed to trigger a squeeze. Red Cat Holdings Inc. NASDAQ: RCAT has seen short interest balloon lately, with 20% of the float now short, a 38% increase over the previous month. A poor Q1 earnings report is likely the culprit, as the company missed EPS expectations by a significant margin—a loss of 27 cents per share reported versus a 10-cent loss expected. However, the company expects to achieve profitability by the end of the year, and its drone capabilities have already sparked interest from the U.S. government. Regulatory tailwinds are at Red Cat’s back, and its next earnings report is scheduled for August 14. QuantumScape Corp. NYSE: QS only has 14% short interest, but that hasn’t stopped it from pumping out a 123% gain over the last month as the short squeeze trend reignited. The EV battery maker’s stock jumped 30% on a single day in June after announcing its new Cobra Separator Process. Since this development, regulatory headwinds for EVs have been introduced, but those were likely priced in as the stock soared again in July. Shares are down 14% this week as the rally takes a breather, but they received a price target boost from Robert Baird, which increased from $6 to $11, now the highest figure on the Street.
