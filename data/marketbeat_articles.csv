Asian markets are mixed and Japan's shares slip after election leaves Ishiba's future in doubt,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/asian-markets-are-mixed-and-japans-shares-slip-after-election-leaves-ishibas-future-in-doubt-2025-07-21/,"BANGKOK (AP) — Asian shares were mixed on Tuesday after U.S. stock indexes inched to more records at the start of a week of profit updates from big U.S. companies. Japan’s benchmark surged and then fell back as it reopened from a holiday Monday following the ruling coalition's loss of its upper house majority in Sunday's election. The Nikkei 225 shed 0.3% to 39,694.89. Analysts said the market initially climbed as investors were relieved that Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba vowed to stay in office despite the setback. But the election's outcome has added to political uncertainty and left his government without the heft needed to push through legislation. A breakthrough in trade talks with the U.S. might win Ishiba a reprieve, but so far there's been scant sign of progress in negotiating away the threat of higher tariffs on Japan's exports to the U.S. beginning Aug. 1. “Relief may be fleeting. Ishiba’s claim to leadership now rests on political duct tape, and history isn’t on his side. The last three LDP leaders who lost the upper house didn’t last two months,” Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. Elsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.3% to 25,057.11, while the Shanghai Composite index also was up 0.3%, at 3,568.78. South Korea's Kospi sank 1.4% to 3,165.40, with investors concerned over the Aug. 1 deadline for making a deal with U.S. President Donald Trump or facing 25% tariffs on all the country's exports to the U.S. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 was little changed at 8,666.30. India's Sensex gained 0.3%, while the SET in Thailand was up less than 0.1%. Many of Trump’s stiff proposed tariffs are paused after he extended the deadline for talks to allow more time to reach potential trade deals that could lower those rates. Aug. 1 is the next big deadline, at least for now. U.S. stock indexes inched their way to more records on Monday to kick off a week full of profit updates from big U.S. companies. General Motors will report its latest profit results later this week, along with such market heavyweights as Alphabet, Coca-Cola and Tesla. The S&P 500 rose 0.1% to 6,305.60 and squeaked past its prior all-time high set on Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged down less than 0.1% to 44,323.07. The Nasdaq composite added 0.4% to its own record, closing at 20,974.17. Verizon Communications helped lead the way and rose 4%. The telecom giant reported a stronger profit and higher revenue for the latest quarter than expected and raised its forecasts for the full year. That helped offset a 5.4% drop for Sarepta Therapeutics, which continued to fall after the Food and Drug Administration said on Friday that it asked the company to voluntarily stop all shipments of Elevidys, its gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, due to safety concerns. Block, Jack Dorsey’s company behind Square, Cash App and other tech brands climbed 7.6% in its first trading after learning it will join the widely followed and imitated S&P 500 index. It will take the place of Hess, which Chevron bought, before trading begins on Wednesday. Cleveland-Cliffs rallied 12.4% after the steel producer reported a smaller loss for the spring than analysts expected. It shipped a record 4.3 million net tons of steel during the quarter, and CEO Lourenco Goncalves said the company has begun to see “the positive impact that tariffs have on domestic manufacturing” and other things. It’s a major supplier to the auto industry, and Trump’s tariffs steer companies hoping to sell cars in the United States toward steel made in the country. In other dealings early Tuesday, U.S. benchmark crude oil lost 71 cents to $65.24 per barrel, while Brent crude, the international standard, gave up 69 cents to $68.52 per barrel. The U.S. dollar rose to 147.62 Japanese yen from 147.38 yen. The euro slipped to $1.1691 from $1.1696. ___ AP Business Writers Matt Ott and Stan Choe contributed.

Can you ever expect privacy in public? Coldplay kiss camera saga tells us a lot about the answer,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/can-you-ever-expect-privacy-in-public-coldplay-kiss-camera-saga-tells-us-a-lot-about-the-answer-2025-07-21/,"NEW YORK (AP) — When the “KissCam” at a Coldplay concert landed on a couple who tried (but failed) to duck out of the spotlight, the internet immediately got to work. In hours, the clip was just about everywhere. Endless memes, parody videos and photos of the pair's shocked faces filled social media feeds. Online sleuths rushed to identify who was on camera. Artificial intelligence and software company Astronomer eventually confirmed that its CEO and chief people officer were in fact the couple in the video — and announced the CEO's resignation over the weekend. The incident's fallout has, of course, generated conversations about business ethics, corporate accountability and the repercussions that conflicts of interest among leadership can cause. But there are also broader implications at play in our increasingly online world — about the state of potentially being visible everywhere you go or tracked through “social media surveillance."" Experts say it's more and more common for moments that may have been intended to be private, or at least reserved to a single physical venue, to make their way online and even go global today. So in the era of lightning-fast social sharing and when cameras are practically inescapable, does being in public hold any expectation of privacy anymore? Is every experience simply fodder for the world to see? It's no secret that cameras are filming much of our lives these days. From CCTV security systems to Ring doorbells, businesses, schools and neighborhoods use ample video surveillance around the clock. Sporting and concert venues have also filmed fans for years, often projecting playful bits of audience participation to the rest of the crowd. In short, the on-scene viewer becomes part of the product — and the center of attention. And of course, consumers can record just about anything if they have a smartphone in their pocket — and, if it's enticing to other social media users, that footage can quickly spread through cyberspace. Ellis Cashmore, author of the book “Celebrity Culture,” proposes that the rapid fame of last week’s KissCam moment probably answers a question many have been asking for years: “Is the private life still what it was? And the answer is, of course, there’s no such thing as the private life anymore,” he notes. “Certainly not in the traditional sense of the term.” “I’m not sure that we can assume privacy at a concert with hundreds of other people,” adds Mary Angela Bock, an associate professor in the University of Texas at Austin’s School of Journalism and Media. “We can’t assume privacy on the street anymore.” Some version of the KissCam has long been a staple at big events — from timeouts during sports games to romantic songs played by artists at their concerts. It’s easy to miss, but most venues have signs to inform the audience that they could be filmed during the event. What’s been different in more recent years, experts note, is how quickly those moments can travel beyond the physical space where they actually unfold. That isn’t only limited to what shows up on a jumbotron. Sometimes it only takes one person in the crowd to capture any interaction on their phone and post the video online — where it can zip around the world. “It’s not just the camera,"" Bock says. “It’s the distribution system that is wild and new.” Then there's the second ring of exposure — what happens after the video or photos spread. Experts point to growing instances of social media users rushing to publicly identify, or dox, the people captured on camera — much like how quickly the internet committed to finding those involved in the Coldplay moment, for example. The LinkedIn pages belonging both to Astronomer’s now-former CEO and chief people officer remained disabled on Monday, and The Associated Press could not reach either for comment. But it isn't limited to company executives. Beyond someone simply spotting a familiar face and spreading the word, technological advances — including AI — have made it easier and faster overall to find just about anyone in an online post. This can happen with videos and photos shared on social media each day, even if it doesn't go viral, experts warn. “It’s a little bit unsettling how easily we can be identified with biometrics, how our faces are online, how social media can track us — and how the internet has gone from being a place of interaction, to a gigantic surveillance system,"" Bock says. “When you think about it, we are being surveilled by our social media. They’re tracking us in exchange for entertaining us.” And of course, such moments can also impact people who were not actually on camera. As easy as it can be to be identified online today, the internet is notorious for cutting a broad swath or not always getting it right. That sometimes produces harassment of individuals not actually involved. At last week's Coldplay concert, for example, many social media users speculated that a third person seen near the two caught on camera was another Astronomer employee — leading to swarms of posts targeting her. But the company later confirmed that she was not at the event and said no other employees were in the video circulating online. For the now-viral moment, “we can talk about what’s right and wrong, and whether they deserved it,” says Alison Taylor, a clinical associate professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business. Still, it’s a “very frightening thing to get a lot of abuse and harassment online,” Taylor notes. “There are real human beings behind this.” It’s hard to think that that these kind of viral moments will ever go away — and there are few legal restrictions to stop users from sharing clips of interactions recorded from anything from a concert to the street widely online. But on an individual level, Bock says it can be helpful to “think before you share” and question whether something’s really accurate. “Social media has changed so much,” Bock says. “But we really have not, as a society, caught up with the technology in terms of our ethics and our etiquette.” ___ Associated Press journalists Hilary Fox and Kelvin Chan contributed to this report.

Banishing a reporter: Trump escalates battle with Wall Street Journal over Epstein story,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/banishing-a-reporter-trump-escalates-battle-with-wall-street-journal-over-epstein-story-2025-07-21/,"President Donald Trump on Monday followed up his lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal over last week's Jeffrey Epstein story by banishing one of the newspaper's reporters from Air Force One for an upcoming Scotland trip. The moves reflect Trump's aggressiveness toward media who displease him — even a media magnate, Rupert Murdoch, with outlets that have been friendly to him in the past. Trump filed a $10 billion defamation lawsuit against the Journal and Murdoch on Friday because of the newspaper's article about a sexually suggestive letter bearing Trump's name that was included in a 2003 album compiled for alleged sex trafficker Epstein's birthday. The president has denied having anything to do with it. On Monday, the White House said it was removing a Journal reporter from the pool covering the president's trip this weekend to his golf courses in Turnberry and Aberdeen in Scotland. The Journal's Tarini Parti had been scheduled to cover him on the trip. “Due to the Wall Street Journal's fake and defamatory conduct, they will not be one of the thirteen outlets on board,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. The Journal declined comment on the action. It's a tactic the Trump White House has used before. It restricted the access of journalists from The Associated Press to press events when the news outlet would not change its style guidelines to reflect Trump's renaming of the Gulf of Mexico. That launched a legal battle that is wending its way through the courts. The defamation lawsuit is another tool Trump has used against media outlets. He has sued CBS News for its editing of a “60 Minutes” interview with former opponent Kamala Harris; ABC News for a false statement made by George Stephanopoulos in a story regarding a New York writer who had accused Trump of sexual abuse; and Meta after it removed Trump's social media accounts following the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. In each of those cases, Trump won multimillion-dollar settlements. But in those instances, news was only one part of a major corporation's business. In the case of Murdoch and News Corp., news is the chief part of his business. The Journal has vowed to fight. It's also the first time Trump has sued for defamation as a sitting president, and it's not clear whether any president has done that in the past. “There’s nothing inherently wrong with a president bringing a libel suit,” said noted free speech attorney Floyd Abrams. “But this claim certainly seems like nothing more or less than an effort to suppress speech that our president finds discomforting. That’s not why we have libel law. It’s why we have a First Amendment.” It's all part of a broader pattern of trying to intimidate news organizations that report stories Trump does not like, said Jameel Jaffer, executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University. “These are lawsuits that have no hope of actually succeeding as lawsuits, but nevertheless have the potential to chill media organizations from doing what all of us need them to do,” Jaffer said. Not every news organization has bowed down; “60 Minutes,” in fact, did some notably tough stories about the early days of Trump's second administration. But it's impossible to quantify stories that weren't done because of fear of a fight with the White House, he said. The Wall Street Journal leans conservative editorially, but hasn't been afraid to take Trump on in both its opinion and news sections. Other Murdoch outlets — Fox News Channel and the New York Post — are much friendlier to him. Ever since the administration announced that it would not be releasing additional government files from the case against Epstein, factions of Trump's base supporters have turned on him. That has put some normally supportive news outlets in a difficult position. Fox News largely avoided the story after Trump suggested his allies stop wasting time on it. But Fox's Howard Kurtz reported on The Wall Street Journal lawsuit on his “Media Buzz” show Sunday, saying that by doing so, “the president has drawn extra attention to the Journal's reporting.” The president's battle with the press has taken on several dimensions. He has been fighting to take away government support for news organizations like Voice of America, and last week the Republican-controlled Congress voted to take away federal funding from NPR and PBS because the president says their news programming is biased against conservatives. ___ David Bauder writes about the intersection of media and entertainment for the AP.

Looming over two cases threatening Musk's car company is a single question: Can he be trusted?,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/looming-over-two-cases-threatening-musks-car-company-is-a-single-question-can-he-be-trusted-2025-07-21/,"MIAMI (AP) — Elon Musk fought court cases on opposite coasts Monday, raising a question about the billionaire that could either speed his plan to put self-driving Teslas on U.S. roads or throw up a major roadblock: Can this wildly successful man who tends to exaggerate really be trusted? In Miami, a Tesla driver who has admitted he was wrong to reach for a dropped cell phone moments before a deadly accident, spoke of the danger of putting too much faith in Musk's technology — in this case his Autopilot program. “I trusted the technology too much,” said George McGee, who ran off the road and killed a woman out stargazing with her boyfriend. “I believed that if the car saw something in front of it, it would provide a warning and apply the brakes.” In unusual coincidence, regulators arguing an Oakland, California, case tried to pin exaggerated talk about the same Tesla technology at the center of a request to suspend the carmaker from being able to sell vehicles in the state. Musk's tendency to talk big — whether it's his cars, his rockets or his government costing-cutting efforts — have landed him in trouble with investors, regulators and courts before, but rarely at such a delicate moment. After his social media spat with President Donald Trump, Musk can no longer count on a light regulatory touch from Washington. Meanwhile, sales of his electric cars have plunged and so a hit to his safety reputation could threaten his next big project: rolling out driverless robotaxis — hundreds of thousands of them — in several U.S. cities by the end of next year. The Miami case holds other dangers, too. Lawyers for the family of the dead woman, Naibel Benavides Leon, recently convinced the judge overseeing the jury trial to allow them to argue for punitive damages. A car crash lawyer not involved in the case, but closely following it, said that could cost Tesla tens of millions of dollars, or possibly more. “I’ve seen punitive damages go to the hundreds of millions, so that is the floor,” said Miguel Custodio of Los Angeles-based Custodio & Dubey. “It is also a signal to other plaintiffs that they can also ask for punitive damages, and then the payments could start compounding.” That Tesla has allowed the Miami case to proceed to trial is surprising. It has settled at least four deadly accidents involving Autopilot, including payments just last week to a Florida family of a Tesla driver. That said, Tesla was victorious in two other jury cases, both in California, that also sought to lay blame on its technology for crashes. Lawyers for the plaintiffs in the Miami case argue that Tesla’s driver-assistance feature, called Autopilot, should have warned the driver and braked when his Model S sedan blew through flashing lights, a stop sign and a T-intersection at 62 miles-an-hour in an April 2019 crash. Tesla said that drivers are warned not to rely on Autopilot, or its more advanced Full Self-Driving system. It says the fault entirely lies with the ""distracted driver"" just like so many other “accidents since cellphones were invented.” Driver McGee settled a separate suit brought by the family of Benavides and her severely injured boyfriend, Dillon Angulo. McGee was clearly shaken when shown a dashcam video Monday of his car jumping a Key West, Florida, road and hitting a parked Chevrolet Tahoe which then slammed into Benavides and sent her 75 feet through the air to her death. Asked if he had seen those images before, McGee pinched his lips, shook his head, then squeaked out a response, “No.” Tesla's attorney sought to show that McGee was fully to blame, asking if he had ever contacted Tesla for additional instructions about how Autopilot or any other safety features worked. McGee said he had not, though he was heavy user of the features. He said he had driven the same road home from work 30 or 40 times. Under questioning, he also acknowledged he alone was responsible for watching the road and hitting the brakes. Summarizing the testimony, Tesla said in a statement after the court adjourned that McGee had ""stated the simple truth that we all know: If he had just paid attention to the road instead of searching for his dropped cell phone and pressing the accelerator —which he was doing for over a minute before the crash — this tragic accident would never have happened.” But lawyers for the Benavides family had a chance in the courtroom at parrying that line of argument, asking McGee if he would have taken his eyes off the road and reached for his phone had he been driving any car other than a Tesla on Autopilot. McGee responded, “I don’t believe so.” The case is expected to continue for two more weeks. In the California case, the state's Department of Motor Vehicles is arguing before an administrative judge that Tesla has misled drivers by exaggerating the capabilities of its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features. A court filing claims even those feature names are misleading because they offer just partial self-driving Musk has been warned by federal regulators to stop making public comments suggesting Full Self-Driving allows his cars to drive themselves because it could lead to overreliance on the system, resulting in possible crashes and deaths. He also has run into trouble with regulators for Autopilot. In 2023, the company had to recall 2.3 million vehicles for problems with the technology and is now under investigation for saying it fixed the issue though it’s unclear it has, according to regulatory documents. The California case is expected to last another four days. ___ Condon reported from New York. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

"Budget office says Trump's tax law will add $3.4 trillion to deficits, leave 10 million uninsured",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/budget-office-says-trumps-tax-law-will-add-34-trillion-to-deficits-leave-10-million-uninsured-2025-07-21/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's tax and spending law will add $3.4 trillion to federal deficits through 2034, the Congressional Budget Office reported Monday, a slight increase in the projection that takes into account the final tweaks that Republicans made before getting the legislation over the finish line. More than 10 million people will be uninsured under the law in 2034 because of the law, CBO found, an improvement from an earlier projection that found 11.8 million people losing coverage over the decade. The release of the CBO analysis Monday comes at the end of a grueling legislative fight, but at the start of a longer political struggle to come as the two parties clash over the law's impact on the economy, healthcare and government programs. Republicans are touting the bill as a tax cut for all Americans, yet a recent AP-NORC poll found about two-thirds of U.S. adults expect the new tax law will help the rich as Democrats attack the legislation. The bill Trump signed into law on July 4 extended current tax rates for individuals that were set to expire at the end of this year and temporarily created new tax deductions for tips, overtime and auto interest loans for new vehicles assembled in the U.S. Republicans also used the bill to cut future spending on Medicaid and food assistance, and to phase out certain clean energy tax credits more quickly. Democrats were quick to highlight the CBO's findings. “Today’s report reminds us of something: facts are stubborn and the facts are clear,” said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. ”The big, ugly betrayal is a loser for the country and will be a loser for the Republicans."" Republicans say the bill was critical to ensure most Americans didn't experience a significant tax increase next year. Trump and Republicans have also insisted that economic growth will exceed the CBO's projections for the next decade, erasing the projected deficits as more revenue comes into the Treasury than anticipated. Nonpartisan fiscal watchdogs also highlighted the CBO's latest projection. Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said there will be a shorter-term “sugar high” as stimulus makes its way through the economy. But modelers from across the ideological spectrum agree that any sustained economic changes are likely to be modestly beneficial, or negative. “And not one serious estimate claims this bill will improve our fiscal situation,” MacGuineas said. “Rather, positive growth effects are likely to be swamped by the effects of higher debt and interest rates.” The CBO said more than $1 trillion in deficit savings is generated through the health portions of the bill, which includes new work requirements for certain Medicaid beneficiaries in states that expanded the program through the Affordable Care Act. Some late changes on Medicaid were made to the bill to win over holdouts. One of those changes added a $50 billion fund for rural hospitals. __ Associated Press writer Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.

"Parents of man who died in Colorado jail say nurses, deputies ignored his pleas for 15 hours",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/parents-of-man-who-died-in-colorado-jail-say-nurses-deputies-ignored-his-pleas-for-15-hours-2025-07-21/,"DENVER (AP) — The parents of a man who died alone in a Colorado jail cell after an ulcer burned a hole in his digestive tract and left him in what they said was excruciating pain for about 15 hours filed a federal lawsuit Monday, accusing the jail's nurses and sheriff's deputes of ignoring his cries for help. The lawsuit blames them, local government officials and Southern Health Partners for failing to stop the death of Daniel Foard in 2023 by taking him to the hospital. Foard, 32, was a cook at a brewpub and user of fentanyl who was arrested for failing to appear in court. After being segregated and monitored for withdrawal from the synthetic opioid, he began vomiting and complained of stomach pain after being put in a regular jail cell, it said. The lawsuit alleges Southern Health Partners — the Tennessee-based company they contracted with to provide health care at the La Plata County jail — has tried to maximize its profits at the jail by only having one nurse on duty at a time, leaving it to medically untrained deputies to monitor sick inmates. The company holds hundred of contracts at jails around the country and the lawsuit alleges that is has been involved in lawsuits related to the deaths of at least five other jail inmates nationally. The company's lawyer, Shira Crittendon, said she had not seen the lawsuit and declined to comment on it. The sheriff's office referred questions about the the lawsuit to a county spokesperson. In a statement, the county said it had not analyzed the allegations in the lawsuit and does not comment publicly on active litigation. Foard was found dead in the jail on Aug. 17, 2023, six days after he was arrested. An autopsy found Foard died as a result of a hole created by an ulcer in his small intestine, which caused inflammation of the tissue lining his abdomen. Such ulcers can let food and digestive juices leak out of the body's digestive tract. Fentanyl was found in Foard's blood but the autopsy report did not name that as a cause of his death. Dr. Michael Arnall ruled Foard's death was due to natural causes. On Aug. 15, 2023, even though Foard had collapsed several times and had trouble standing, he was moved out of an area where he could be more easily observed for problems with his withdrawal and put into a regular jail cell, staggering as we went, the lawsuit said. The day nurse ignored a deputy's concern that he was very unstable, according to the lawsuit brought by lawyers Dan Weiss, Anna Holland Edwards, John Holland and Erica Grossman. After a deputy delivering breakfast on Aug. 16, 2023 saw that Foard repeatedly fell while trying to get his tray, the jail's day nurse came to check on him, it said. She recorded that Foard reported he had sharp, shooting pain that was a “10” on a scale of one to 10, but she did not call for a doctor or send him to the hospital, it said. The nurse moved Foard to an empty cell where he could be monitored but didn't tell deputies what he was being monitored for and didn't order any follow up care or check on him, it said. He vomited all day and was moved to another cell and then a third because they had all become so messy with vomit, it said. Surveillance video showed him crawling to the final cell, where it said he continuously called out for help and yelled that he needed to go to a hospital, saying he was vomiting blood. The lawsuit claims that no one responded to his pleas but one deputy could be heard on surveillance video telling him to “try to hit that drain” with his vomit to keep the cell from becoming dirty. Another nurse, working the evening shift, only walked by his cell and glanced inside, but did not assess him or provide care as he was pleading for help, the lawsuit said. When she did enter his cell around 10 p.m., Foard was dead, it said. She told state investigators that vomiting was normal for people withdrawing from fentanyl. The day shift nurse later told a state investigator that it was not unusual that Foard would not have had his vital signs checked for 12 hours because of the number of inmates the jail's nurses need to provide care, according to a report from an investigation by the Colorado Bureau of Investigations. She also said she didn't think there was anything different she could have done based on Foard's symptoms. The bureau's findings were forwarded to the 6th District Attorney's Office, which would decide whether any criminal charges were warranted in connection with Foard's death. It's not known whether the office decided to pursue any charges. A telephone message and email sent to District Attorney Sean Murray were not immediately returned. In a statement, Jim Foard and Susan Gizinski said they want everyone to know about their son's ordeal both to hold those they say are responsible for his death accountable and to change how inmates are treated at the jail. “Just basic training in having compassion for others would be a great start. But adding more staff is critical too,” they said. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

Federal agents in Miami arrest a prominent Haitian businessman and once presidential hopeful,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/federal-agents-in-miami-arrest-a-prominent-haitian-businessman-and-once-presidential-hopeful-2025-07-21/,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Federal agents in Miami have arrested Pierre Réginald Boulos, a well-known Haitian businessman, doctor and former presidential hopeful. The arrest occurred at Boulos' home in South Florida late last week, a person familiar with the arrest said Monday. Boulos was born in the United States but renounced his citizenship to run for president of Haiti in recent years. He obtained his U.S residency last year under the Biden administration. Boulos, who previously has denied a flurry of corruption allegations, is the most well-known Haitian arrested to date by agents with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. It wasn’t immediately clear why Boulos was arrested. ICE did not return a message seeking details. An attorney for Boulos could not be immediately reached for comment. Boulos was being held at Krome North Service Processing Center in Miami, a detention center that Human Rights Watch said in a recent report is one of three in Florida that are grossly over capacity and “flagrantly violate international human rights standards.” Boulos founded several businesses while in Haiti, where he served as president of the National Chamber of Commerce and Industry. In 2019, he created the Third Way Movement, a political party in contrast to the ""shameless elite and the unscrupulous politicians who are working to bog down the country and increase the suffering of the people,” he said at the time, according to local media. The party promptly stated it would seek ""a historic political compromise that would facilitate the negotiated departure from power of Jovenel Moïse.” Boulos visited Haiti’s central region in August 2019 as he rallied for support. “I am part of the system that must be destroyed,"" he was quoted as saying by Le Nouvelliste newspaper. “I know how to destroy it.” Moïse served as president from 2017 until he was gunned down at his private residence in July 2021. Dozens of suspects were arrested, including seventeen former Colombian soldiers who are still being interrogated by Haitian authorities. Court documents have stated that those involved in the plot included Christian Emmanuel Sanon, a pastor, doctor and failed businessman who envisioned himself as Haiti’s new leader. Elections have not been held since Moïse was killed. Gang violence surged in the political vacuum that ensued, and Boulos soon returned to the U.S. The arrest comes as the Trump administration seeks to end legal protections for hundreds of thousands of Haitians after announcing it would revoke such protections for those who arrived in the U.S. under a humanitarian parole program. Rod Joseph, a Haitian-American running for U.S. Congress, said he has been working with the administration to avoid deporting people “just for the fun of it.” “If the president goes after criminals, no one is against that,” he said over the phone on Monday. “But if you deport someone who doesn’t commit any crime who’s here seeking a better life, this is when we start having issues with the practice.” Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

Domino’s Delivers Another Discounted Entry for Income Investors,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/dominos-delivers-another-discounted-entry-for-income-investors/,"Domino’s (NASDAQ DPZ) FQ2 results were weak, underperforming reduced expectations, with growth slowing and earnings in contraction, but that is not what investors should focus on. Those negative details are short-lived headlines that do not offset the increase, profits, improved business leverage, and substantial capital return. Nevertheless, a knee-jerk reaction from the market led to a fall in DPZ share prices—putting it back into attractive territory where buy-and-hold investors are likely to scoop it up. Institutional investor data tracked by MarketBeat suggests the group is likely to buy on the late-July price pullback. The group bought on balance in Q1 and Q2, as well as in the first weeks of July, netting nearly $2 in shares for every one sold, providing solid support for the market. Institutional support is significant as they own nearly 95% of the shares and are expected to continue buying. While Domino’s faces some headwinds in 2025—particularly around input costs and margin compression—it continues to grow its store count and comparable sales, boosting operating leverage. Domino's Q2 revenue was as expected at $1.15 billion, up 4.7% on a constant currency basis, with strength across all segments. Global Retail sales grew by 5.6% on a combination of store count and comp-store growth, in-store and delivery options. Store count improved by nearly 1%, U.S. comps grew by 3.4%, and International comps by 2.4% aided by market share gains. The margin is the sticking point for investors in 2025. The company improved income from operations but net contracted, resulting in a 5.5% decrease in GAAP EPS, driven by increased input costs and insurance expenses. The good news is that the earnings are sufficient to sustain the balance sheet health while investing in growth and returning capital, including dividend distribution and share buybacks.  Share buybacks reduced the count by nearly 1% on a year-to-date (YTD) basis and are expected to continue as the year progresses. The dividend yields approximately 1.5%, which is slightly better than the broad market average. It is reliable and accounts for roughly 40% of the earnings forecast reported by MarketBeat. Domino’s executives didn’t provide guidance but offered a favorable outlook, citing best-in-industry unit metrics and an ability to drive long-term value for franchisees and investors. While analyst sentiment in 2025 has moderated slightly, evidenced by some price target reductions, the overall tone remains constructive. The 26 analysts tracked by MarketBeat forecast steady mid-single-digit revenue growth compounded by accelerated and accelerating earnings growth through the middle of the next decade. Earnings growth is forecasted to exceed 10%, with July stock prices valuing the business at a significant discount of only 10 times the 2035 forecast. Analysts have given DPZ stock a Moderate Buy rating and view the stock as fairly valued. A move to the low end of the trading range is possible, but new lows are unlikely without a change to the outlook, which is unexpected. The likely outcome is that DPZ price action will remain range-bound in 2025. The opportunity is to load up on shares when they are low in the range, building a position for when macroeconomic headwinds subside and tailwinds can blow. In this scenario, DPZ shares will continue to pay their dividend while the company reduces the share count and builds store count and brand leverage.

TSLA Earnings Week: Can Tesla Break Through $350?,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/tsla-earnings-week-can-tesla-break-through-350/,"Shares of Tesla Inc NASDAQ: TSLA have been rallying hard since April’s low, gaining more than 50% in that timeframe. A 3% pop last Friday added to the momentum, and the chart is showing signs of an explosive move in the near term. After a multi-month stretch of tightening consolidation, Tesla is now coiled in a bullish pennant formation that looks ready to come to a head as the automotive giant heads into arguably its most important earnings report of the year. The “test” for Tesla isn’t just what gets reported this Wednesday; it’s whether the stock can find the momentum to punch through resistance. With both the bulls and the bears drawing their battle lines, this week’s report could be the catalyst defining the rest of Tesla’s year. The good news for those of us on the sidelines is that Tesla’s chart looks bullish going into the report. Since April, there has been a clear pattern of higher lows, as the bears have been unable to check the upward progress. At the same time, there have been some lower highs, which may be to Tesla’s advantage. The narrowing range they’ve formed has created a textbook pennant formation, and as the company approaches its earnings, the pattern is nearing its apex. A bullish MACD crossover late last week supports the thesis that momentum is building on the bull’s side, and a strong earnings report could be just the ticket to send shares breaking out to the north. If that happens, the $350–$370 zone is very much in play. A move through that level would confirm the uptrend isn’t just intact, it’s gaining strength. Tesla is forecast to report a year-over-year drop in revenue and earnings, with vehicle deliveries already confirmed to be down meaningfully from last year. This is reflected in how many on Wall Street have taken a cautious stance, but it also sets the stock up nicely for an upside surprise. Tesla has missed on earnings more often than not in recent quarters, and most recent EPS revisions have been to the downside. Recent ratings lean more towards Hold or Sell, rather than Buy, which makes Tesla a dangerous stock to bet against. Don’t forget that the company delivered a massive miss on the headline numbers in April’s report, then went on to rally more than 60% almost unchecked. Additional fuel for the rally might come in the form of fresh updates from CEO Elon Musk on Tesla’s AI roadmap, including the integration of its Grok chatbot into the Optimus humanoid robot and potentially even into Tesla vehicles themselves. There’s also been the much-hyped robotaxi launch, and comments around that could easily become the main story, with investors watching for any updates about additional monetization potential or the regulatory progress. If Wednesday’s update were to add clarity to the company’s multiple ambitions, it should be enough to kick off the next leg of the rally. It’s worth noting, though, that Tesla’s P/E ratio sits near 180, frothy by any definition, especially with profit and revenue expected to decline year over year. However, the bulls will argue that Tesla is no longer just an EV company but an AI and energy infrastructure play with massive potential. To sustain that narrative, though, Tesla must prove it can deliver meaningful innovation and execution, especially in a tougher macro and competitive environment. For now, though, the bulls have the momentum, and the chart looks healthy. Last week’s bullish crossover of the MACD might well have been the best signal yet that the tightening pennant will be broken by the stock breaking out to the north.

"Goldman, Morgan Stanley, & BofA: Diverging Paths After Earnings",https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/goldman-morgan-stanley-and-bofa-diverging-paths-after-earnings/,"Wall Street just wrapped up a big week for earnings in the financial sector, and if there's one clear thing, it's that not all banks are built the same right now. With rising interest rates no longer the tailwind they once were, and margin pressure becoming a theme, investors are quickly drawing lines between the winners and the also-rans. While all three major bank stocks profiled below have rallied strongly since April, their post-earnings setups diverge rapidly. Let's see which ones are worth chasing and which might be best avoided. Of the three, Goldman Sachs Group Inc NYSE: GS is the best performer since April, up more than 60% and now consolidating just below all-time highs. On paper, there's a lot to like. The company has just delivered a solid set of Q2 earnings, beating analyst expectations and showing revenue growth of 15% year-over-year. Valuation-wise, it's also solid with a P/E ratio of around 15, not too hot and not too cold. But there's a sense that much of the good news is already priced in. Despite the headline beat, the stock's reaction was muted. Several analysts called it a Hold in the aftermath of Wednesday's report, with Market Perform and Equal Weight ratings dominating the commentary. While shares are still below many of the refreshed price targets, the lack of urgency suggests the near-term upside might be limited unless Goldman can show another gear. There's no question this has been the hottest bank stock of the past few months, but it's also starting to feel like a lot of the easy gains have already been made. Shares of Morgan Stanley NYSE: MS haven't rallied quite as much as Goldman's, but its post-earnings setup looks more interesting. Interestingly, though, shares did drop sharply after Wednesday's earnings release, falling as much as 4% before recovering and finishing Thursday in the green. However, the fact that the dip was so quickly bought up points to a strong undercurrent of demand for the stock right now. Heading into the year's second half, there's a lot to like about Morgan Stanley. Fundamentally, the company exceeded earnings expectations this week, with revenue up nearly 12% year-over-year. Management has also been stepping up with shareholder-friendly moves, including a dividend increase and a larger buyback program. The analyst reaction has also been more encouraging than Goldman's, with Keefe Bruyette & Woods upgrading the stock to Outperform earlier this month. The stock's chart is solid, the fundamentals are improving, and the Street is starting to warm up. If you're looking for the name with the most near-term upside potential, this is probably it. Bank of America Corp. NYSE: BAC has also had a decent run over the past few months, rallying more than 40% since April. However, unlike its peers, it's still trading below its 2022 all-time high, which says a lot. Furthermore, the bank missed revenue expectations in its Q2 report this week, likely weighing on sentiment for the foreseeable future. Investors have had reason to be skeptical, and for now, at least, their skepticism appears justified. While the broader financial sector has been enjoying a bright spell, Bank of America continues to lag its peers on both technicals and fundamentals. There's no real breakout narrative here, and the market seems to know it. To its credit, Bank of America is the cheapest of the three, trading at a P/E ratio of about 13. If you're a deep-value investor willing to stomach more risk, a long-term case must be made. However, in the near term, there are simply better options.

Build Stability and Income With 3 Overlooked Dividend Leaders,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/build-stability-and-income-with-3-overlooked-dividend-leaders/,"Dividend investing is one of the most popular strategies among retail investors seeking a combination of stability and passive income. A long-term buy-and-hold approach for stalwart dividend players like The Coca-Cola Co. NYSE: KO or Johnson & Johnson NYSE: JNJ rewards patience and a commitment to reinvesting payouts over time. Many investors seek dividend yields in the 2-3% range and dividend payout ratios below about 80%, taking these as indicators of a company's ability to continue paying dividends sustainably for an extended period of time. It's also possible to seek a slightly more aggressive approach to dividend income in companies with higher yields and payout ratios. Of course, higher yields do not necessarily guarantee a sustainable long-term dividend income, and investors should also monitor payout ratios to ensure that any dividend targets retain enough income to maintain and grow their business. Investors might find that the companies below strike an attractive balance of operational stability and high dividend yields. Enterprise Products Partners L.P. NYSE: EPD is a midstream energy services firm with infrastructure that includes roughly 50,000 miles of pipeline. Enterprise has yet to fully recover after a share price dip in early April, alongside the Trump administration's tariff announcements. This makes for a unique buy opportunity on what many investors consider a hold-forever name. Enterprise has about three decades of dividend distribution history to support its position as a prime dividend leader. Although the firm's payout ratio is somewhat high at 80.2%, this solid record of dividend payouts and increases should allay investor concerns. What's more, the company's high dividend yield of 6.82% is only likely to look more attractive when the Fed lowers interest rates. In addition to these factors, analysts see room for capital appreciation. Enterprise is expected to post earnings growth above 5% in the coming year, and nine out of 14 analysts rate EPD shares a Buy. At a consensus price target above $36 per share, Enterprise stock could rise by 15% or more alongside earnings improvement. Like EPD above, shares of logistics and delivery giant United Parcel Service NYSE: UPS have been down in recent months. The stock fell in February and again in April 2025 and remains nearly 20% below its start to the year. However, with improvements to operational efficiency and profit in the first quarter of the year, the company's strategy of pursuing higher-quality deliveries over all-out volume seems to be paying off. Critically for the passive income seeker, UPS has a 16-year history of dividend increases and a high yield of 6.55%. The company's dividend payout ratio of 95.6% is elevated and may scare off some investors. However, those willing to take a risk, or those optimistic about the company's likelihood of continuing to grow its earnings, may be rewarded with substantial dividend payouts. Fortunately, analysts believe that UPS will experience earnings growth (10.3%) in the coming quarters. The company also has upside potential of just under 20%, suggesting that capital growth may also be a factor to consider. ONEOK Inc. NYSE: OKE is also a midstream energy services company. However, while Enterprise's share price has risen somewhat since plunging in early April, ONEOK's stock plateaued during the same period and is thus down more than 21% YTD. However, the company may be able to improve its position thanks to new construction that should expand its infrastructure. OKE shares may appeal to dividend investors because of their 5.1% dividend yield. The company's payout ratio of 80.5% is roughly equivalent to Enterprise's above. Still, the firm has a long history of stability in its dividend disbursements, thanks to its similarly stable cash flow. Analysts are broadly optimistic about ONEOK and predict that the company's earnings could rise by more than 17% in the coming quarters. A price target of over $103 per share would imply nearly 29% in upside potential, despite the fact that only just over half of the 16 analysts rating OKE shares have assigned it a Buy. Like both companies above, ONEOK combines a compelling dividend yield with a potentially high payout ratio and the potential for share price appreciation.

Iran sends a rocket designed to carry satellites into a suborbital test flight,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/iran-sends-a-rocket-designed-to-carry-satellites-into-a-suborbital-test-flight-2025-07-21/,"TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iran tested one of its satellite carrying rockets with a suborbital flight on Monday, state media reported, the first such test since a ceasefire was reached after a 12-day war waged by Israel against Iran in June, which also saw the United States strike nuclear-related facilities in the Islamic Republic. The test was the latest for a program that the West says improves Tehran’s ballistic missiles. A report by the official IRNA news agency said the Ghased satellite carrier test aimed at “assessing some emerging new technologies in the country’s space industry.” It said the test results will help improve the function of Iran's satellites and space systems. The report did not provide any further details on the test flight or from where the rocket was launched. Iran from time to time Iran launches satellite carriers to send its satellites to the space. Last September, Iran launched a satellite into space with a rocket built by the country’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard. The Ghased, a solid and fluid fuel rocket, was first inaugurated in 2020 by the Guard when it put a military satellite in the orbit. The war in June killed nearly 1,100 Iranians, including senior military commanders and nuclear scientist. Retaliatory missile barrages by Iran killed 28 in Israel.

Subway hires former Burger King executive as its new CEO,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/subway-hires-former-burger-king-executive-as-its-new-ceo-2025-07-21/,"Subway has hired a former Burger King executive as its new CEO. The Miami-based sandwich chain said Monday that Jonathan Fitzpatrick will join the company on July 28. Fitzpatrick is the first CEO hired since Subway was bought by the private equity firm Roark Capital in 2024. And Roark didn’t have to look far to find him. Since 2012, Fitzpatrick has been the president and CEO of Driven Brands, which is also owned by Roark. Driven Brands is the parent company of auto service brands like Meineke Car Care Centers and Maaco. Before joining Driven Brands, Fitzpatrick held multiple senior leadership positions at Burger King, including executive vice president. Subway was founded in 1965 and was still owned by its founding families when it was purchased by Roark. It’s one of the world’s largest restaurant chains, with nearly 37,000 outlets in more than 100 countries. But in recent years, Subway has been losing sales to fast-growing rivals like Jersey Mike’s and Firehouse Subs. The company tried to catch up. In 2022, it announced a line of chef-developed sandwiches after finding that customers were tiring of Subway’s traditional model of letting customers build their own subs. When Roark bought Subway, it said it planned to continue to modernize restaurants and expand internationally. It left in place Subway’s CEO John Chidsey, who was the first nonfamily member to lead Subway when he joined the company in 2019. But Chidsey retired late last year. Roark, which is known for its expertise in restaurant management, backs two holding companies that own multiple restaurant chains: Inspire Brands, the parent of Arby’s, Dunkin’, Jimmy John’s, Sonic and Buffalo Wild Wings; and GoTo Foods, which owns Auntie Anne’s, Carvel, Cinnabon and Jamba. In June, Roark bought Dave’s Hot Chicken in a deal valued at $1 billion. Before you consider Buffalo Wild Wings, you'll want to hear this.

Mayor denies wrongdoing in a corruption probe into Milan's building boom,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/mayor-denies-wrongdoing-in-a-corruption-probe-into-milans-building-boom-2025-07-21/,"MILAN (AP) — Milan Mayor Giuseppe Sala on Monday said he would not step down in the face of a sweeping probe into the city’s massive urban development over the last two decades, saying, “My hands are clean.” The city’s top urban development official, however, resigned while denying wrongdoing. Milan prosecutors last week announced a widespread investigation into the real estate boom that has seen skyscrapers transform the city’s skyline and entire neighborhoods rebuilt, including the construction of an Olympic village for the 2026 Milan-Cortina Winter Games. The investigation targets more than 70 people, including Sala, as prosecutors allege corruption that made Italy’s financial and fashion capital “a commodity to be plundered.’’ The probe alleges that developers bribed officials to speed building permits and win approval for projects. Prosecutors are seeking the arrest of six people, including Giancarlo Tancredi, an architect who has been the city’s top urban development official since 2021. Tancredi announced his resignation to focus on his defense but denied any wrongdoing. “My conscience is clear,’’ he said. Sala, a member of the center-left Democratic Party who is serving his second term as mayor, denied any wrongdoing during an address to the city council, saying, “All I have done is in the interest of the city.’’ Sala pledged to continue in his mandate, which expires at the end of 2026, and underlined the necessity of continuing projects that are in the works, including determining the future of Milan’s San Siro stadium, home to soccer clubs AC Milan and Inter Milan. The teams want the city to jointly buy the stadium so they can tear it down and build a new one. The investigation has led to calls by the center-right majority that governs from Rome for Sala to step down. But he has received the support of Lombardy's regional governor, Attilio Fontana, a prominent center-right politician, while Premier Giorgia Meloni urged caution, saying an investigation should not automatically lead to resignation. Milan’s extraordinary development around the 2015 Expo and now the Olympics has sent real estate prices skyrocketing. Many say ordinary workers have been priced out in gentrification. “Do we need to do more to make Milan more fair, healthy and balanced? By definition, we must always do more,’’ Sala said.

What to know about the CEO caught embracing an employee on the jumbotron at a Coldplay concert,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/what-to-know-about-the-ceo-caught-embracing-an-employee-on-the-jumbtron-at-a-coldplay-concert-2025-07-21/,"LONDON (AP) — A routine moment of crowdwork at a Coldplay concert went viral last week when a couple tried to avoid the spotlight after they were caught hugging on the jumbotron. Internet sleuths quickly figured out that they were the CEO and chief people officer of a little-known tech company called Astronomer. The snippet of video set the internet alight, fueling a wave of memes and drawing attention to the erosion of privacy in public spaces. Here are some things to know: During the concert on Wednesday at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, lead singer Chris Martin asked the cameras to scan the crowd for his “Jumbotron Song,” when he sings a few lines about the people the camera lands on. A man wearing a birthday sash was up first. Two people in banana costumes were highlighted. But in between, something unexpected happened. For several seconds, a couple was shown on the big screen. They were cuddling and smiling, his arms wrapped around her, as she leaned back into him. When they saw themselves on the big screen, her jaw dropped, her hands flew to her face and she spun away from the camera. He ducked out of the frame, as did she. “Either they’re having an affair or they’re just very shy,” Martin joked. It didn’t end there. After the video went viral, the internet got to work. Online sleuths rapidly figured out that the man was Andy Byron, chief executive officer, while she was Kristin Cabot, the chief people officer — in other words, the head of human resources. Astronomer, based in New York, provides big companies with a platform that helps them organize their data. The company at first said little about the incident. In response to an initial inquiry from The Associated Press, Astronomer's spokesman said only that a statement attributed to Byron that circulated online immediately after the incident was a “fake from a clearly labeled parody account.” The company later confirmed the identities of the couple in a statement to AP. In the hours after the video went viral, Byron's name was at one point the most searched term on Google. Astronomer eventually addressed the situation, announcing in a LinkedIn post late Friday that Byron had been placed on leave and that the board of directors had launched a formal investigation. The company said a day later that Byron had resigned, and that its cofounder and chief product officer, Pete DeJoy, was tapped as interim CEO while it searches for Byron’s successor. “Astronomer is committed to the values and culture that have guided us since our founding. Our leaders are expected to set the standard in both conduct and accountability, and recently, that standard was not met,” the company said in its post on LinkedIn. DeJoy weighed in on Monday how the company was thrust into the spotlight. “The events of the past few days have received a level of media attention that few companies—let alone startups in our small corner of the data and AI world — ever encounter,” he wrote on Linkedin. ""The spotlight has been unusual and surreal for our team and, while I would never have wished for it to happen like this, Astronomer is now a household name. It’s easy to miss, but most concert venues have signs informing the audience that they could be filmed during the event. Look for them on the walls when you arrive and around the bar areas or toilets. It’s common practice especially when bands like to use performances for music videos or concert films. The venue in this case, Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, also has a privacy policy online which states: “When you visit our location or attend or participate in an event at our location, we may capture your image, voice and/or likeness, including through the use of CCTV cameras and/or when we film or photograph you in a public location.” In the internet age, such videos — or ones taken on someone's smartphone — can quickly zip around the world. This video rocketed around social media, as people speculated about why the couple dodged the camera. Empathy for the pair and their families was mixed with plenty of snarky commentary and countless memes, with the fake statement from the chief executive generating a lot of additional vitriol. And news reports said that Byron's LinkedIn account was disabled after it was flooded by a wave of comments. “It’s a little bit unsettling how easily we can be identified with biometrics, how our faces are online, how social media can track us — and how the internet has gone from being a place of interaction, to a gigantic surveillance system,"" said Mary Angela Bock, an associate professor in the University of Texas at Austin’s School of Journalism and Media. ""We are being surveilled by our social media. They’re tracking us in exchange for entertaining us.” _____ AP Business Writer Wyatte Grantham-Philips contributed to this report from New York.

Kinder Morgan: At the Hotspot of the Natural Gas Revolution,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/kinder-morgan-at-the-hotspot-of-the-natural-gas-revolution/,"Kinder Morgan NYSE: KMI is poised to grow robustly over the coming years, at a steady and reliable pace that income investors can appreciate. Growth will be driven by the combination of its expanding natural gas pipeline network and capacity, compounded by increasing demand for these resources. Demand growth, forecast by KMI at 20% through the decade’s end, is tied to decarbonization and the rapid expansion of natural gas infrastructure, including numerous projects coming online globally this year and next. “With historic growing natural gas demand forecasts, a positive federal regulatory environment, and highly supportive federal permitting agencies, the future for our company is very bright,” said Executive Chairman Richard D. Kinder. The steady and reliable growth pace fuels a steadily improving cash flow, ample profits, and the ability to self-fund expansion while paying its substantial dividend and maintaining a healthy balance sheet. The dividend is a critical factor for this investment, as it pays more than 4.2% as of mid-July, and the distribution is expected to increase over time.  Kinder Morgan’s dividend payment is safe and reliable, despite its eye-popping, nearly 100% payout ratio. While a red flag, this company’s business model includes long-term contracts that provide clear revenue and earnings visibility, allowing it to pay dividends from its distributable cash flow, which is superior and sufficient, providing a payout ratio of 65% in FQ2 2025. At the quarter’s end, balance sheet highlights include mildly increased liability offset by steady cash, increased total assets, and rising equity. Leverage also remains low, with long-term debt running at approximately one times the equity, and credit costs declining due to recent improvements in credit ratings. Two of the major rating agencies lifted their outlook to positive, indicating potential for an upgrade, while the other affirmed its BBB rating and stable outlook. Kinder Morgan had a solid Q2 with revenue of $4.04 billion, growing by 13.2% and outpacing MarketBeat’s reported consensus. The outperformance is substantial, topping the consensus forecast by 550 basis points, driven by strength in the natural gas and LNG export segments. Margin news is also favorable, with natural gas margins realigning with long-term trends as projects come online. The only bad news is that analysts had expected a little more; the $0.28 in adjusted earnings is as expected despite the top-line strength. The guidance serves as a catalyst for a long-term increase in share price. It was improved, with management expecting to exceed its forecast by at least the contribution of its recent acquisition. That forecast puts full-year net income growth well above the 8% originally forecasted and is supported by the growing backlog. The company’s project backlog increased to $9.3 billion, a 6% net increase, with new projects outpacing those put into service by nearly 2-to-1 on a dollar basis. The analysts' trends for KMI stock in the early second half of 2023 are positive and provide a lift for the market. Not only is the coverage increasing, but positive price target revisions support the firm's Moderate Buy rating. The consensus in mid-July is for a 10% upside while the trend leads to the high-end range, which tops out at $38. The $38 target represents a 38% upside in addition to the 4.2% dividend yield. The institutional group similarly supports KMI stock. They own more than 60% of the shares, their activity ramped to a multi-year high in 2025, and they are buying on balance, netting nearly $2 in shares for every $1 sold through mid-July.

"5 years after Ohio's $60M bribery scandal, critics say more could be done to prevent a repeat",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/5-years-after-ohios-60m-bribery-scandal-critics-say-more-could-be-done-to-prevent-a-repeat-2025-07-21/,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Five years after a $60 million bribery scheme funded by FirstEnergy Corp. came to light in Ohio, expert observers say the resulting prosecutions, lawsuits, penalties and legislation haven't led to enough change and accountability to prevent politicians and corporate executives from cutting similar deals in the future. The scheme — whose prospective $2 billion-plus pricetag to consumers makes it the largest infrastructure scandal in U.S. history — surfaced with the stunning arrests of a powerful Republican state lawmaker and four associates on July 21, 2020. That lawmaker, former House Speaker Larry Householder, is serving 20 years in federal prison for masterminding the racketeering operation at the center of the scandal. Jurors agreed with prosecutors that money that changed hands wasn’t everyday political giving, but an elaborate secret scheme orchestrated by Householder to elect political allies, become the House speaker, pass a $1 billion nuclear bailout law in House Bill 6 and crush a repeal effort. One of the dark money groups Householder used also pleaded guilty to racketeering. Householder and a former lobbyist have unsuccessfully challenged their convictions. Two of the arrested associates pleaded guilty, and the other died by suicide. Any hope that the convictions would have clarified federal law around 501(c)4 nonprofit “dark money” groups or prompted new restrictions on those hasn’t materialized, said former U.S. Attorney David DeVillers, who led the initial investigation. “I think it’s actually worse than it was before,” he said. “Nationally, you have both Democrats and Republicans using these, so there’s no political will to do anything about it.” Indeed, a study released in May by the Brennan Center for Justice found that dark money unleashed by the 2010 Citizens United decision hit a record high of $1.9 billion in 2024 federal races, nearly double the $1 billion spent in 2020. The vast majority of money from undisclosed donors raised into dark money accounts now goes to super PACs, providing them a way to skirt a requirement that they make their donors public, the study found. DeVillers said one positive result of the scandal is that Ohio lawmakers appear genuinely concerned about avoiding quid pro quos, real or perceived, between them and their political contributors. Anti-corruption legislation perennially introduced by Ohio Democrats since the scandal broke has gone nowhere in the GOP-dominated Legislature. Republican legislative leaders have said it is outside their authority to amend federal campaign finance law. The U.S. Attorney’s office declined to discuss the investigation because prosecutions remain ongoing. Two fired FirstEnergy executives have pleaded not guilty on related state and federal charges and await trial. Former Public Utilities Commission of Ohio Chairman Samuel Randazzo, to whom FirstEnergy admitted giving a $4.3 million bribe in exchange for regulatory favors, had faced both federal and state charges. He died by suicide after pleading not guilty. Akron-based FirstEnergy — a $23 billion Fortune 500 company with 6 million customers in five states — admitted using dark money groups to bankroll Householder’s ascendance in exchange for passage of the bailout bill. It agreed to pay $230 million and meet other conditions to avoid prosecution, and faced other sanctions, including a $100 million civil penalty by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. But FirstEnergy hasn't yet faced consequences from the state regulator. “They never actually got penalized by regulators at the PUCO level,” said Ohio Consumers’ Counsel Maureen Willis, the lawyer for Ohio utility customers. Testimony in four PUCO proceedings stemming from the scandal finally began last month after the cases were delayed for nearly two years, in part at the request of the Justice Department. They’re intended to determine whether FirstEnergy used money for bribes that was meant for grid modernization and whether it improperly comingled money from its different corporate entities. FirstEnergy spokeperson Jennifer Young said it invested $4 billion in grid upgrades in 2024 and plans to spend a total of $28 billion through 2029. Young said FirstEnergy has redesigned its organizational structure, established a dedicated ethics and compliance office, overhauled the company’s political activity and lobbying practices and strengthened other corporate governance and oversight practices. “FirstEnergy is a far different company today than it was five years ago,” she said. The PUCO also made changes in response to the scandal. Chair Jenifer French told state lawmakers that ethics training has been enhanced, staff lawyers and the administrative law judges who hear cases now report to different directors to ensure legal independence, and she never takes a meeting alone. Ashley Brown, a retired executive director of the Harvard Electricity Policy Group who previously served as a PUCO commissioner, said the commission is the only state entity with the power to order FirstEnergy to return tainted cash — including the bribe money — to customers. That largely hasn’t happened. He said the Ohio commission had vast power to hold FirstEnergy accountable for its misdeeds but hasn't conducted its own management audit of the energy giant, demanded an overhaul of FirstEnergy’s corporate board or pressed for public release of FirstEnergy’s own internal investigation of the scandal, whose findings remain a mystery. Shareholders won some accountability measures as part of a $180 million settlement in 2022, but they continue to fight in court for release of the investigation. Willis does, too. “How do you allow a utility to operate a vast criminal conspiracy within the utility (with) consumer dollars, and you don’t even look at what went wrong?” Brown said. PUCO spokesperson Matt Schilling reiterated that the commission's probes are ongoing. He said the panel has vowed to take its proceedings “wherever the facts lead.” The portion of HB 6 that bailed out two FirstEnergy-affiliated nuclear plants was repealed in 2021, and $26 million was refunded to customers. The scandal investigation revealed that other power distribution companies got a lucrative payout of their own added to the bill in exchange for their buy-in: subsidies for two unprofitable Cold War-era coal plants. It wasn’t until April that a law was passed repealing those subsidies. Until that takes effect Aug. 14, the charges cost Ohio ratepayers $445,679 a day — and it’s unclear if or when they’ll get that money back. A ticker on Willis’ website puts the total they’ve paid at more than $500 million and counting. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

How Robinhood Stock Benefits From New Pro Gambling Tax Changes,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/how-robinhood-stock-benefits-from-new-pro-gambling-tax-changes/,"A tiny passage in President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) Act can potentially massively disrupt the professional sports betting industry in the U.S. Under the new law, professional gamblers won’t get the same lenient tax treatment as stock and options traders, as only 90% of betting losses will be tax-deductible against income, as opposed to the complete 100% under the previous rule. While a 10% tweak may seem minor, it will drastically change the U.S. betting landscape as pros seek ways to minimize their tax burden. One unlikely winner of this whole situation? Robinhood Markets Inc. NASDAQ: HOOD is already soaring to new all-time highs. The life of a professional gambler is far less glamorous than amateur bettors assume. You aren’t sitting in stadium club boxes getting showered in cash and high-fiving celebrities; you’re hunched over your phone at a sports book, poring over the dozens (if not hundreds) of bets you’ve made that week. Professional gamblers are more like day traders, seeking out small gains after small gains, avoiding losses, and hoping to win slightly more than they lose. A win rate of 50% isn’t enough to break even either. To beat the sports book’s house cut, which is often called the vig or juice, you need to win 52.4% of the time. Now, imagine you’re a newbie pro gambler calculating your year-end earnings. Your bankroll for the year was $5 million, and you placed $5,000 wagers on 1000 different bets. If you lose 470 of your 1000 bets, you’ve lost $2.35 million while earning $2.65 million from your 530 winning bets. You’re up $300,000 on the year since your losses cancel out your winnings. Or at least they used to. Thanks to new legislation in the OBBB Act, you can only deduct 90% of your gambling losses on your taxes. So in this scenario, you’d only be able to deduct $2,115,000 of your $2,350,000 in losses. Your net profits are $300,000, but your taxable income is $485,000 (and this hypothetical doesn’t even factor in the betting vig!) An income of $485,000 for a single filer has a 35% federal tax rate in 2025, so your obligation to the IRS would be $169,750 - a nearly $65,000 increase on your tax bill from the previous regulation. While this change will have little effect on weekend warriors betting NFL parlays on DraftKings Inc. NASDAQ: DKNG, professionals will likely seek new jurisdictions or alternative ways to bet on sports. Enter event contracts. Prediction markets have become popular features in the finance sector, especially among crypto adopters. Polymarket and Kalshi are two of the largest platforms operating in the U.S., where gamblers can bet on everything from sports to elections to stock prices to the high temperature in New York City on a given Tuesday. Yes, it gets degenerate fast. Robinhood has also started offering prediction markets through a partnership with Kalshi, with events ranging from Fed funds rates, unemployment rates, gas prices, and (of course) sports. Unlike traditional sports betting, event contract trading is regulated under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which considers them to be Swaps, or notional principal contracts. This distinction is crucial; Swaps are taxed as ordinary income, meaning if your winning swaps earn $200,000 and your losing swaps lose $100,000, you can deduct the full $100,000 in losses against your gains. Regulation under the CFTC also allows Robinhood to bypass state gambling commissions, which have historically shown hostility toward these types of contracts. Prediction markets through Robinhood offer professional sports bettors a new avenue to wager on NFL, NBA, and other pro leagues without the onerous tax obligations. Naturally, Robinhood takes a small commission on each transaction, and event contracts aren’t a ‘gambler vs. the house’ proposition; your counterparty is another trader taking the opposite side of the action. Counterparty risk and liquidity risk aren’t worries for gamblers at a casino, but must be considered when trading on these new and lightly-regulated prediction markets. However, the growth is undeniable as Robinhood reported more than one billion event contracts traded in the first six months of availability, helping fuel the company’s 50% year-over-year (YOY) quarterly revenue growth. The $927 million figure was the second-highest in Robinhood’s history, and analysts have been scrambling to update their price targets to reflect more bullishness. Piper Sandler, Morgan Stanley, and JMP Securities all bumped their price projections this week to $110, $110, and $125, respectively. The stock continues to provide reasons to buy, and analysts and investors alike will be watching intently when the company releases its Q2 2025 earnings on July 30.

Over 5.2 million pools sold across the U.S. and Canada are under recall after reports of nine deaths,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/over-52-million-pools-sold-across-the-us-and-canada-are-under-recall-after-reports-of-nine-deaths-2025-07-21/,"NEW YORK (AP) — More than 5.2 million aboveground swimming pools sold across the U.S. and Canada over the last two decades are being recalled after nine drowning deaths were reported. The recall covers a range of Bestway, Intex Recreation and Polygroup pools that were sold by major retailers as far back as 2002. According to Monday notices published by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and Health Canada, these pools have compression straps running along the outside of the product — which “may create a foothold” for small children and allow them to access the water unattended. That can pose a serious drowning risk, the safety regulatory warn. To date, the CPSC believes nine children across the U.S. have drowned after gaining access to these now-recalled pools in this way. Those deaths occurred between 2007 and 2022, involving children between the ages of 22 months and 3 years old. No additional fatalities have been reported in Canada. Consumers in possession of these pools are urged to immediately contact Bestway, Intex and/or Polygroup to receive a free repair kit — which will consist of a rope to replace the compression strap. Owners of these pools should otherwise ensure that small children cannot access the pool without supervision, regulators note — and could alternatively drain the pool until the repair is made. All of the pools being recalled are 48 inches or taller — and can be identified by brand and model names listed on both the CPSC and Health Canada's recall notices. Sales of the pools ranged by model and location, but date as far back to 2002 and as recently as 2025. About 5 million of these now-recalled pools were sold across the U.S. — including both online and in-stores at major retailers like Walmart, Target, Lowe's, Costco and Amazon. Another 266,000 were sold in Canada. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

3 Bullish Biotech Stocks With Explosive Growth Trends,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/3-bullish-biotech-stocks-with-explosive-growth-trends/,"Investing in biotechnology stocks is similar to the drug development process itself. That is, investors frequently experience long periods of nothing much happening, interrupted by periods of sharp movement. This is particularly true of small-cap biotech stocks. In many cases, these are unprofitable companies with little to no revenue. However, these are also the companies that can provide the highest return for risk-tolerant investors. The risk with these stocks is that the company can deliver poor clinical trial results. In some cases, promising medicine never gets through the rigorous Food & Drug Administration (FDA) process. Even if they do, there’s always the risk of competitors getting to market faster. MarketBeat has made it easier for investors to manage the risk in biotech stocks with its new FDA Events tool that allows investors to stay on top of critical catalysts for these stocks. That information, combined with bullish analyst sentiment, can point you to stocks that may be ready for a breakout. Here are three small-cap biotech stocks to consider. UroGen Pharma Ltd. NASDAQ: URGN is a small-cap biotech company focused on treating urologic cancers and diseases. The company’s flagship drugs, Jelymyto and Zusduri, feature UroGen’s proprietary RTGel technology. This allows the drugs to stay in the urinary tract longer, which can improve their efficacy. UroGen stock is up approximately 43% in 2025 as the company has applied to expand the Jelymyto label to include low-grade bladder cancer. This would significantly expand the drug’s addressable market to include the 6th most common cancer in the United States. Phase 3 trial results are due in the second half of 2025. The UroGen analyst forecasts on MarketBeat give URGN stock a $32.86 price target, a gain of over 115% from its closing price on July 18. Investors should note that much of the stock’s aggressive price movement in the last three months is likely due to short covering. Over 42% of the URGN stock float is sold short, which could keep gains in check until a new catalyst exists.  Nektar Therapeutics NASDAQ: NKTR is an example of why investing in biotech stocks carries significant risk. Even after a 78% gain in 2025, NKRT stock is still down over 93% in the last five years. The stock slide is largely due to several high-profile clinical trial failures. However, investors are bullish about the company’s latest candidate for treating systemic lupus erythematosus and ulcerative colitis, among other conditions. The company delivered positive Phase 2b clinical trial results, which also resulted in a Fast Track designation from the FDA. The Nektar Therapeutics analyst forecasts on MarketBeat have an $88.33 consensus price target on the stock, a 254% increase from its closing price on July 18. However, a pullback is likely with NKTR stock up over 100% in the last 30 days. Short interest is around 10% and has jumped over 104%. On the other hand, after a series of asset sales and cost reductions, the company has extended its runway to get its drugs through the clinical trial process.  Gene editing is one of the most tantalizing fields of study in the biotech sector. Verve Therapeutics NASDAQ: VERV is at the forefront of using gene editing to treat cardiovascular disease. Verve is still a clinical-stage company, so its product revenue is primarily from partnerships and equity offerings. However, the company was approved for a Phase 1b U.S. clinical trial for its lead candidate, VERVE-102, in early 2025. This is a CRISPR-based editing therapy designed for one-time use. The drug targets the PCSK9 gene that drives high cholesterol and atherosclerosis. Unlike the other two stocks on this list, VERV stock has the lowest ceiling. Analysts have a consensus price target of $14.57 on the stock. That's still a 33% upside, but that’s significantly lower than the potential in the other two stocks. Analysts are likely considering the long-term nature of clinical trials. However, it’s worth noting that short interest has dropped over 30%, which is typically a sign that bearish sentiment is waning.  Before you consider Verve Therapeutics, you'll want to hear this.

Ford Foundation's outgoing president joins the board of Obama Foundation,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/ford-foundations-outgoing-president-joins-the-board-of-obama-foundation-2025-07-21/,"Darren Walker’s post-Ford Foundation future is starting to take shape, as the outgoing president is now set to join The Obama Foundation’s board of directors. The Obama Foundation, the Chicago-based nonprofit of former President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama focused on encouraging active involvement in democracy through initiatives like the My Brother’s Keeper Alliance and the Obama Youth Jobs Corps, announced Monday that Walker would join the board on Nov. 1. “Darren Walker is an outstanding example of what it means to lead with purpose in philanthropy,” President Obama said in a statement. “Darren’s work to challenge long-held assumptions, stand up to injustice, and build unlikely partnerships aligns perfectly with the mission of the Obama Foundation. His experience and insight will sharpen our thinking and deepen our impact as we help the next generation of leaders change their world for the better.” Walker, 65, who has led the Ford Foundation since 2013 and oversaw major investments in gender equity and disability rights, is one of philanthropy’s best-known leaders. He has been one of Rolling Stone’s “25 People Shaping the Future” and Time’s “100 Most Influential People.” “Joining The Obama Foundation Board feels like coming home to everything I believe about leadership and change,” Walker said in a statement. “I believe deeply in the power of individuals to change the world, and I’m honored to work with President and Mrs. Obama to help empower and support the next generation of changemakers.” In addition to his new role at the Obama Foundation, Walker has already been named president of the National Gallery of Art. In September, “The Idea of America: Reflections on Inequality, Democracy, and the Values We Share,” a collection of his essays, will be published. The Ford Foundation has selected Yale Law School Dean Heather Gerken, a leading expert on constitutional law and democracy, to succeed Darren Walker as its president. Marty Nesbitt, chairman of the Obama Foundation’s board of directors, said Walker will help the nonprofit stick to its mission. “Darren brings a rare combination of visionary thinking and practical know-how that will strengthen our governance and sharpen our impact,” he said. “His deep experience leading through complexity and bringing diverse voices to the table will be an invaluable asset as we guide the foundation into its next chapter and open the Obama Presidential Center next year.” _____ Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

FDA names former pharmaceutical company executive to oversee US drug program,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/fda-names-former-pharmaceutical-company-executive-to-oversee-us-drug-program-2025-07-21/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Food and Drug Administration on Monday named a longtime pharmaceutical executive to run the agency’s drug program, the latest in a string of leadership changes at the agency. FDA Commissioner Marty Makary announced that Dr. George Tidmarsh, a cancer and pediatric specialist, will direct the agency’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, which regulates the safety and effectiveness of all U.S. drugs. His appointment comes a month after the center’s acting director, Dr. Jacqueline Corrigan-Curay, announced her retirement. As the agency's top drug regulator, Tidmarsh will be charged with following through on a number of commitments made by Makary and his boss, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., including reviewing the safety of the abortion pill mifepristone. The FDA is also scrutinizing certain uses of other long-established drugs, including antidepressants and hormone-replacement drugs for menopause. Tidmarsh founded and led several pharmaceutical companies, including Horizon Pharmaceuticals, maker of an anti-inflammatory medication for arthritis. He has also served as an adjunct professor at Stanford University. The FDA's drug center is the agency's largest unit, with nearly 6,000 staffers responsible for reviewing the safety and effectiveness of new drugs and monitoring the use and marketing of older drugs. About 2,000 FDA staffers have been laid off as part of widescale cuts to the federal health workforce overseen by Kennedy. More than 1,000 others have taken buyouts or early retirement, while many others are reportedly searching for new jobs. The departures have threatened basic FDA operations, including the timely review of new drugs. FDA's drug center hasn’t had a permanent director since January, when Dr. Patrizia Cavazzoni stepped down days before President Donald Trump took office. Nearly all of the FDA’s senior leadership positions have turned over in recent months, either due to retirements, resignations or actions by administration officials placing them on administrative leave. FDA center directors typically hold their positions for years or even decades, serving across multiple administrations, whether Republican or Democrat. In May, Makary named Dr. Vinay Prasad, a prominent critic of the FDA’s COVID response, to run the agency’s vaccine center. He was also named to the post of FDA chief medical officer. Prasad joined the agency after his predecessor, longtime vaccine chief Dr. Peter Marks, was forced out in March. The head of FDA’s tobacco center was also forced to step down in April. A permanent replacement has not yet been named. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
