"Broken altimeter, ignored warnings: Hearings reveal what went wrong in DC crash that killed 67",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/broken-altimeter-ignored-warnings-hearings-reveal-what-went-wrong-in-dc-crash-that-killed-67-2025-08-02/,"Over three days of sometimes contentious hearings this week, the National Transportation Safety Board interrogated Federal Aviation Administration and Army officials about a list of things that went wrong and contributed to a Black Hawk helicopter and a passenger jet colliding over Washington, D.C., killing 67 people. The biggest revelations: The helicopter's altimeter gauge was broken, and controllers warned the FAA years earlier about the dangers that helicopters presented. At one point NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy scolded the FAA for not addressing safety concerns. “Are you kidding me? Sixty-seven people are dead! How do you explain that? Our bureaucratic process?” she said. “Fix it. Do better.” Victims of the January crash included a group of elite young figure skaters, their parents and coaches and four union steamfitters from the Washington area. Here is a look at the major takeaways from the hearings about the collision, which alarmed travelers before a string of other crashes and close calls this year added to their worries about flying: The helicopter was flying at 278 feet (85 meters) — well above the 200-foot (61-meter) ceiling on that route — when it collided with the airliner. But investigators said the pilots might not have realized that because the barometric altimeter they were relying on was reading 80 to 100 feet (24 to 30 meters) lower than the altitude registered by the flight data recorder. The NTSB subsequently found similar discrepancies in the altimeters of three other helicopters from the same unit. An expert with Sikorsky, which makes the Black Hawks, said the one that crashed was an older model that lacked the air data computers that make for more accurate altitude readings in newer versions. Army Chief Warrant Officer Kylene Lewis told the board that an 80- to 100-foot (24- to 30-meter) discrepancy between the different altimeters on a helicopter would not be alarming, because at lower altitudes she would be relying more on the radar altimeter than the barometric altimeter. Plus Army pilots strive to stay within 100 feet (30 meters) of target altitude on flights, so they could still do that even with their altimeters that far off. But Rick Dressler of medevac operator Metro Aviation told the NTSB that imprecision would not fly with his helicopters. When a helicopter route like the one the Black Hawk was flying that night includes an altitude limit, Dressler said, his pilots consider that a hard ceiling. Both tried to deflect responsibility for the crash, but the testimony highlighted plenty of things that might have been done differently. The NTSB’s final report will be done next year, but there likely will not be one single cause identified for the crash. “I think it was a week of reckoning for the FAA and the U.S. Army in this accident,” aviation safety consultant and former crash investigator Jeff Guzzetti said. Army officials said the greater concern is that the FAA approved routes around Ronald Reagan International Airport with separation distances as small as 75 feet (23 meters) between helicopters and planes when planes are landing on a certain runway at Reagan. “The fact that we have less than 500-foot separation is a concern for me,” said Scott Rosengren, chief engineer in the office that manages the Army’s utility helicopters. Army Chief Warrant Officer David Van Vechten said he was surprised the air traffic controller let the helicopter proceed while the airliner was circling to land at Reagan’s secondary runway, which is used when traffic for the main runway stacks up and accounts for about 5% of flights. Van Vechten said he was never allowed to fly under a landing plane as the Black Hawk did, but only a handful of the hundreds of times he flew that route involved planes landing on that runway. Other pilots in the unit told crash investigators it was routine to be directed to fly under landing planes, and they believed that was safe if they stuck to the approved route. Frank McIntosh, the head of the FAA’s air traffic control organization, said he thinks controllers at Reagan “were really dependent upon the use of visual separation” to keep traffic moving through the busy airspace. The NTSB said controllers repeatedly said they would just “make it work.” They sometimes used “squeeze plays” to land planes with minimal separation. On the night of the crash, a controller twice asked the helicopter pilots whether they had the jet in sight, and the pilots said they did and asked for visual separation approval so they could use their own eyes to maintain distance. Testimony at the hearing raised serious questions about how well the crew could spot the plane while wearing night vision goggles and whether the pilots were even looking in the right spot. The controller acknowledged in an interview that the plane’s pilots were never warned when the helicopter was on a collision path, but controllers did not think telling the plane would have made a difference at that point. The plane was descending to land and tried to pull up at the last second after getting a warning in the cockpit, but it was too late. An FAA working group tried to get a warning added to helicopter charts back in 2022 urging pilots to use caution whenever the secondary runway was in use, but the agency refused. The working group said “helicopter operations are occurring in a proximity that has triggered safety events. These events have been trending in the wrong direction and increasing year over year.” Separately, a different group at the airport discussed moving the helicopter route, but those discussions did not go anywhere. And a manager at a regional radar facility in the area urged the FAA in writing to reduce the number of planes taking off and landing at Reagan because of safety concerns. The NTSB has also said the FAA failed to recognize a troubling history of 85 near misses around Reagan in the three years before the collision, NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said “every sign was there that there was a safety risk and the tower was telling you that.” But after the accident, the FAA transferred managers out of the airport instead of acknowledging that they had been warned. “What you did is you transferred people out instead of taking ownership over the fact that everybody in FAA in the tower was saying there was a problem,” Homendy said. “But you guys are pointing out, ‘Welp, our bureaucratic process. Somebody should have brought it up at some other symposium.’” ___ Associated Press writer Leah Askarinam contributed. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

India indicates it will keep buying Russian oil despite Trump's threats,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/india-indicates-it-will-keep-buying-russian-oil-despite-trumps-threats-2025-08-02/,"NEW DELHI (AP) — India has indicated that it would continue buying oil from Russia despite threats by U.S. President Donald Trump. The Indian foreign ministry said its relationship with Russia was “steady and time-tested,” and should not be seen through the prism of a third country. Addressing a weekly presser on Friday, spokesman Randhir Jaiswal said India’s broader stance on securing its energy needs was guided by the availability of oil in the markets and prevailing global circumstances. The comments follow an announcement by President Donald Trump that he intends to impose a 25% tariff on goods from India plus an additional import tax because of New Delhi’s purchases of Russian oil. The threat came as the U.S. president has increasingly soured on Russia for failing to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine and has threatened new economic sanctions if progress is not made. India bought 68,000 barrels per day of crude oil from Russia in January 2022, but by June of same year oil imports rose to 1.12 million barrels per day. The daily imports peaked at 2.15 million in May 2023 and have varied since. Supplies rose as high as nearly 40% of India's imports at one point, making Moscow the largest supplier of crude to New Delhi, the Press Trust of India reported, citing data from Kpler, a data analytics company. India’s daily oil consumption is pegged around 5.5 million barrels, of which nearly 88% is met through imports. The country has historically bought most of its crude from the Middle East, but this has changed since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. India, the world’s third-largest crude importer after China and the U.S., began buying Russian oil available at discounted rates after the West shunned it to punish Moscow.

What to know if you're at risk of having your wages garnished over student loan debt,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/what-to-know-if-youre-at-risk-of-having-your-wages-garnished-over-student-loan-debt-2025-08-02/,"NEW YORK (AP) — Millions of student borrowers could begin having their wages garnished as soon as this summer, according to estimates from credit bureau TransUnion. The company predicts that by August roughly 3 million borrowers could move into default, meaning they're 270 days past due on payments. At that point, loan holders are at risk of having 15% of their pay docked by the government, with the money going toward the outstanding debt. There has been no clear indication of when wage garnishment will start. After the pandemic-era pause on student loan payments ended in May, borrowers have had to reassess the state of their loans and budgets. According to TransUnion, another 2 million borrowers are on course to default in September. A Biden-administration grace period, during which late or missed payments were not counted against credit scores, ended in the fall. Since then, millions of borrowers have seen hits to their credit ratings. Here's what to know: “The most important thing borrowers can do before administrative wage garnishment restarts is to log into studentaid.gov to check whether their federal student loans are in default and take steps now to remove them from default,” said Kyra Taylor, staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center. Taylor said it's not uncommon for borrowers to be unaware that their loans are in default. If borrowers attended college or graduate school during different periods of time, or if they have different federal loan types, they may also have multiple student loan servicers. If that's the case, you should act now to get your loans out of default and back into good standing by either entering a rehabilitation agreement, where you must make nine consecutive payments based on their income, or by consolidating your loans into a new federal Direct Loan. “Because this hasn’t happened for so long, there are many people who have no idea they’re at risk,"" said Aissa Canchola Bañez, policy director at the Student Borrower Protection Center. Wait times for student borrowers attempting to contact their loan servicers have been long, with many dropped calls, in part due to layoffs at the Education Department. Bañez recommends contacting your congressperson, using a casework tool that can guide you through submitting a constituent request. “These offices have entire teams dedicated to constituent casework for when you have an issue with a federal agency, such as the Department of Education,” she said. “So you can request assistance from your member of congress — your representative or senator.” Until past due payments are paid or the loan's default status is resolved, borrowers are at risk of having up to 15% of their wages deducted directly from their paychecks. The Department of Education has sent notices to borrowers warning that tax refunds and wages could be withheld starting this summer if borrowers don’t take steps to restart payments. The department hasn’t yet provided additional information on timing. Richelle Brooks, 37, an education administrator based in Los Angeles, said she's received warnings and notices about the resumption of collection of her loans. For several degrees, she still has $239,000 in outstanding debt, and she was informed her monthly payments on those loans will be roughly $3,000. “I can't afford it,” she said. “We just came out of the moratorium — not paying for five years. People getting these notices — they're terrified. I'm uneasy, too."" Brooks said she's an informed borrower who stays up to date on each development and who knows her options. She plans to enroll in coding classes, at least half-time, which could place her loans in deferment, so she wouldn't be required to make monthly payments, while she makes a financial plan. There's still time to take action. According to Taylor, the Department of Education must provide 30 days notice before it sends a garnishment order to your employer. During that time, you can request a hearing to object by telling the department that the garnishment would cause you financial hardship. You can also request that the department reduce the amount being garnished and submit documentation about your income and expenses. To do this, you must make your hearing request in writing, postmarked no later than 30 days after the garnishment order. Your loan holder will then arrange the hearing. If you're unsure who your loan holder is, you can contact the Education Department's Default Resolution Group. If you were laid off from your last job, you can also object to garnishment if you have not been in your current job for 12 consecutive months. You can further request a hearing and object if you submitted an application for certain kinds of statutory discharges and those have not yet been decided. Some common reasons for statutory discharge of student loans include: if the school you attended closed before you could complete your degree, if your school owes you a refund but fails to pay it, if you're experiencing total disability, or if you're experiencing bankruptcy. “If the borrower requests a hearing within 30 days after receiving the garnishment notice, the department cannot start garnishment until it issues a decision on the borrower’s objections and financial hardship request,” Taylor said. You can request a hearing after the 30 day period is up, but in those cases the department will generally not stop garnishing your wages while the hearing request is pending. ___ The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

"From Laos to Brazil, Trump's tariffs leave a lot of losers. But even the winners will pay a price",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/from-laos-to-brazil-trumps-tariffs-leave-a-lot-of-losers-but-even-the-winners-will-pay-a-price-2025-08-02/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s tariff onslaught this week left a lot of losers – from small, poor countries like Laos and Algeria to wealthy U.S. trading partners like Canada and Switzerland. They’re now facing especially hefty taxes – tariffs – on the products they export to the United States starting Aug. 7. The closest thing to winners may be the countries that caved to Trump's demands — and avoided even more pain. But it's unclear whether anyone will be able to claim victory in the long run — even the United States, the intended beneficiary of Trump’s protectionist policies. “In many respects, everybody’s a loser here,’’ said Barry Appleton, co-director of the Center for International Law at the New York Law School. Barely six months after he returned to the White House, Trump has demolished the old global economic order. Gone is one built on agreed-upon rules. In its place is a system in which Trump himself sets the rules, using America’s enormous economic power to punish countries that won’t agree to one-sided trade deals and extracting huge concessions from the ones that do. “The biggest winner is Trump,” said Alan Wolff, a former U.S. trade official and deputy director-general at the World Trade Organization. “He bet that he could get other countries to the table on the basis of threats, and he succeeded – dramatically.’’ Everything goes back to what Trump calls “Liberation Day’’ – April 2 – when the president announced “reciprocal’’ taxes of up to 50% on imports from countries with which the United States ran trade deficits and 10% “baseline’’ taxes on almost everyone else. He invoked a 1977 law to declare the trade deficit a national emergency that justified his sweeping import taxes. That allowed him to bypass Congress, which traditionally has had authority over taxes, including tariffs — all of which is now being challenged in court. Trump retreated temporarily after his Liberation Day announcement triggered a rout in financial markets and suspended the reciprocal tariffs for 90 days to give countries a chance to negotiate. Eventually, some of them did, caving to Trump’s demands to pay what four months ago would have seemed unthinkably high tariffs for the privilege of continuing to sell into the vast American market. The United Kingdom agreed to 10% tariffs on its exports to the United States — up from 1.3% before Trump amped up his trade war with the world. The U.S. demanded concessions even though it had run a trade surplus, not a deficit, with the UK for 19 straight years. The European Union and Japan accepted U.S. tariffs of 15%. Those are much higher than the low single-digit rates they paid last year — but lower than the tariffs he was threatening (30% on the EU and 25% on Japan). Also cutting deals with Trump and agreeing to hefty tariffs were Pakistan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines. Even countries that saw their tariffs lowered from April without reaching a deal are still paying much higher tariffs than before Trump took office. Angola's tariff, for instance, dropped to 15% from 32% in April, but in 2022 it was less than 1.5%. And while Trump administration cut Taiwan's tariff to 20% from 32% in April, the pain will still be felt. “20% from the beginning has not been our goal, we hope that in further negotiations we will get a more beneficial and more reasonable tax rate,” Taiwan’s president Lai Ching-te told reporters in Taipei Friday. Trump also agreed to reduce the tariff on the tiny southern African kingdom of Lesotho to 15% from the 50% he’d announced in April, but the damage may already have been done there. Countries that didn't knuckle under — and those that found other ways to incur Trump's wrath — got hit harder. Even some poorer countries were not spared. Laos' annual economic output comes to $2,100 per person and Algeria's $5,600 — versus America's $75,000. Nonetheless, Laos got rocked with a 40% tariff and Algeria with a 30% levy. Trump slammed Brazil with a 50% import tax largely because he didn't like the way it was treating former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who is facing trial for trying to lose his electoral defeat in 2022. Never mind that the U.S. has exported more to Brazil than it's imported every year since 2007. Trump's decision to plaster a 35% tariff on longstanding U.S. ally Canada was partly designed to threaten Ottawa for saying it would recognize a Palestinian state. Trump is a staunch supporter of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Switzerland was clobbered with a 39% import tax — even higher than the 31% Trump originally announced on April 2. ""The Swiss probably wish that they had camped in Washington'' to make a deal, said Wolff, now senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. ""They’re clearly not at all happy.’’ Fortunes may change if Trump's tariffs are upended in court. Five American businesses and 12 states are suing the president, arguing that his Liberation Day tariffs exceeded his authority under the 1977 law. In May, the U.S. Court of International Trade, a specialized court in New York, agreed and blocked the tariffs, although the government was allowed to continue collecting them while its appeal wend its way through the legal system, and may likely end up at the U.S. Supreme Court. In a hearing Thursday, the judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit sounded skeptical about Trump's justifications for the tariffs. “If (the tariffs) get struck down, then maybe Brazil’s a winner and not a loser,’’ Appleton said. Trump portrays his tariffs as a tax on foreign countries. But they are actually paid by import companies in the U.S. who try to pass along the cost to their customers via higher prices. True, tariffs can hurt other countries by forcing their exporters to cut prices and sacrifice profits — or risk losing market share in the United States. But economists at Goldman Sachs estimate that overseas exporters have absorbed just one-fifth of the rising costs from tariffs, while Americans and U.S. businesses have picked up the most of the tab. Walmart, Procter & Gamble, Ford, Best Buy, Adidas, Nike, Mattel and Stanley Black & Decker, have all hiked prices due to U.S. tariffs ""This is a consumption tax, so it disproportionately affects those who have lower incomes,'' Appleton said. “Sneakers, knapsacks ... your appliances are going to go up. Your TV and electronics are going to go up. Your video game devices, consoles are going to up because none of those are made in America.’’ Trump’s trade war has pushed the average U.S. tariff from 2.5% at the start of 2025 to 18.3% now, the highest since 1934, according to the Budget Lab at Yale University. And that will impose a $2,400 cost on the average household, the lab estimates. “The U.S. consumer’s a big loser,″ Wolff said. ____ AP Economics Writer Christopher Rugaber contributed to this story.

Bitcoin and Dividends: A Winning Combo in These 3 ETFs,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/bitcoin-and-dividends-a-winning-combo-in-these-3-etfs/,"With Bitcoin trading just below all-time highs, there is fresh attention on the world's first and largest cryptocurrency. Investors concerned about the future of the dollar may also be inclined to turn to crypto, though the space remains highly speculative. If the risk of investing directly in Bitcoin or another major token is too high, an alternative is a cryptocurrency-focused exchange-traded fund (ETF). The most straightforward crypto funds are spot ETFs like the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund NYSEARCA: FBTC. These funds invest directly in Bitcoin and are thus highly risky, although they do provide a layer of protection for investors in that investors don't have to store and transfer crypto holdings by themselves. An income-generating Bitcoin fund may be a better alternative for less risk-tolerant investors. These funds typically use crypto futures, covered calls, and other complex strategies to generate distributions that function similarly to dividend payments made by traditional stocks. Of course, tax implications in these cases may be different, so it's up to the investor to keep track of the implications. One way to generate income for investors is with call options on Bitcoin futures ETFs, and that's exactly the play that the NEOS Bitcoin High Income ETF NYSEARCA: BTCI aims for. This fund invests in exchange-traded products (ETPs) directly exposed to Bitcoin. BTCI is actively managed, meaning that the team from NEOS makes decisions about how and when to utilize call options to maximize distributions while also achieving upside potential. BTCI is one of the newer ETFs in the Bitcoin and crypto space, having only launched late in 2024. However, its track record so far is highly successful; it has returned more than 26% in 2025 alone. This is in addition to monthly distributions, which have provided the fund with a dividend yield of 22.2%. Investors should expect to pay for this fund's active management. BTCI, unsurprisingly, has a fairly high expense ratio of 0.98%. Far cheaper crypto funds are available, but many investors may find the fund's track record and history of distributions to more than make up for the comparably high cost. For a bit more diversification outside of the Bitcoin space, investors might look to the Global X Blockchain & Bitcoin Strategy ETF NASDAQ: BITS. BITS does include a focus on the Bitcoin futures market, but it also aims for exposure to stocks of companies in the blockchain technology and digital assets industries as well as other ETFs focused on blockchain. BITS has traditionally offered investors a distribution twice per year, translating to an annual dividend yield of 24.5%. Considering the fund's substantial payouts and active strategy combining cryptocurrency with traditional stocks and ETFs, the fund's expense ratio of 0.65% is relatively low. Its year-to-date (YTD) return of roughly 18% is likely quite compelling. Investors should be aware, though, that BITS has quite low assets under management (AUM) at just $35.4 million and low trading volume, which may make liquidity a concern for more active traders. The first Bitcoin-related ETF to launch in the United States was the ProShares Bitcoin ETF NYSEARCA: BITO. However, BITO does not invest directly in Bitcoin; instead, it invests in futures and swaps. As might be expected for the first-ever Bitcoin fund, BITO has substantially higher AUM and trading volume than BITS above, with about $2.8 billion in invested assets. Distributions are also a popular draw for BITO investors, as the fund makes monthly payments and has a dividend yield of 49.6%. With an expense ratio of 0.95%, BITO remains on the higher end of the expense ratio scale for Bitcoin funds, but the fund's strong history, its distributions, and recent performance likely make that a worthwhile fee for many investors. BITO has returned about 21% so far this year, far ahead of the broader market. Before you consider NEOS Bitcoin High Income ETF, you'll want to hear this.

Profits drop at Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway as it writes down its Kraft Heinz investment,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/profits-drop-at-warren-buffetts-berkshire-hathaway-as-it-writes-down-its-kraft-heinz-investment-2025-08-02/,"OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Warren Buffett's company reported less than half as much profit in the second quarter as it took a $3.76 billion writedown on the value of its stake in Kraft Heinz, as that iconic food producer considers largely undoing the merger that Berkshire Hathaway helped bankroll. Berkshire said it earned $12.37 billion, or $8,601 per Class A share, during the quarter. That's down from $30.248 billion, or $21,122 per Class A share, a year ago, because it recorded a much smaller paper investment gain this year. Berkshire's earnings can swing wildly from quarter to quarter because it has to record the current value of its massive investment portfolio even though it doesn't sell most of the stocks. That's why Buffett has long recommended that investors pay more attention to Berkshire's operating earnings, which exclude those investment gains. Although last year Berkshire did surprise shareholders by selling off a huge chunk of its Apple stake which inflated the investment gains then. By that measure, Berkshire's operating earnings were only down slightly at $11.16 billion, or $7,759.58 per Class A share. That compares with $11.598 billion, or $8,072.16 per Class A share, a year ago. Most of Berkshire's myriad assortment of companies — major insurers like Geico, BNSF railroad, a group of utilities and a collection of manufacturing and retail businesses — generally performed well despite the uncertainty about the economy and President Donald Trump's tariffs. The four analysts surveyed by FactSet Research expected Berkshire to report earnings per Class A share of $7,508.10, so the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate's results were ahead of that. Berkshire owns more than 27% of Kraft Heinz' stock and, for years, it had representatives on the company's board. Buffett has said previously that he believes the company's iconic brands will do well over time, but in hindsight, he overpaid for the investment and underestimated the challenges branded foods face from retailers and the growth of private label products. This spring, Berkshire's representatives resigned from the Kraft Heinz board shortly before the company announced it is exploring strategic options that may include spinning off a large part of its portfolio of brands. Over the years since Berkshire helped Kraft buy Heinz in 2015, the company has been hurt by changing consumer tastes and a shift toward healthier options than Kraft’s core collection of processed foods. Another writedown could be coming in the future because CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert pointed out that Berkshire's holding of 28% of Occidental Petroleum's stock, which is currently valued at about $5.3 billion less than the $16.5 billion that Buffett paid for it. Buffett's is still sitting on a massive pile of $344.1 billion in cash, although the company's reserves dipped slightly from the $347.7 billion cash it was holding at the end of the first quarter. Buffett told shareholders in May he just isn't finding any attractive deals for companies he understands. Buffett surprised shareholders at the annual meeting when he announced that he plans to give up the CEO title at the end of the year and hand over operations to Vice Chairman Greg Abel, but Buffett will remain Chairman. Berkshire shareholders might be disappointed that the company didn't repurchase any of its shares this quarter, even though the price has fallen more than 12% since just before Buffett announced his retirement. But investor Chris Ballard, who is managing director at Check Capital, said he wasn't surprised at the lack of buybacks because even after the recent drop, Berkshire's stock is still selling at a premium compared to the value of its businesses. Many investors are watching Berkshire's BNSF closely after rival Union Pacific announced a plan to buy Norfolk Southern earlier this week to create the nation's first transcontinental railroad. The speculation is that BNSF needs to pursue a merger with eastern rail CSX to be able to compete. But Seifert said it isn't Buffett's style to jump into a deal just because the market thinks he should. Over the decades, he has built Berkshire by finding strong companies selling for less than they are worth. CSX is trading near its 52-week high at $35.01 amid all the deal speculation. “He wants to do it because he found an undervalued franchise -- not because the market says you need to do a deal,” Seifert said. “I think one of the reasons why that cash hasn’t been deployed is that valuations run through the Berkshire M-and-A model tend to be too rich. But if there’s a logical case to be made they’ll accept it.” And BNSF appears to be doing fine right now on its own. The railroad recorded a 19% jump in its operating profit this quarter at $1.47 billion as it cut costs and delivered about 1% more shipments. Berkshire's insurance results disappointed a bit as it appeared the company might be pulling back from writing as much property insurance at a time when premiums aren't as attractive. Even in areas where it is growing, like Geico, Seifert said Berkshire lagged behind peers such as Progressive and Allstate. Berkshire normally pulls back on writing insurance when it doesn't like the premiums. “The insurance business has struggled a bit. I would say the takeaways for me is on that front, they’re doing less property and casualty insurance,” said Ballard, who's firm counts Berkshire as its largest holding. Berkshire said it's underwriting operating profit dipped to just below $2 billion in the quarter from last year's $2.26 billion. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

Why Options Traders Are Betting Big,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/is-pg-and-e-an-ai-power-play-why-options-traders-are-betting-big/,"Utility stocks are typically known for their predictability, not for explosive growth. It is especially noteworthy, then, when market indicators begin flashing for one of the utility sector’s most-watched companies. For Pacific Gas & Electric NYSE: PCG, a dramatic, recent spike in bullish activity suggests some professional investors believe the company is at a major inflection point. This unusual interest warrants a deeper look into the fundamental drivers that could be fueling a powerful turnaround, one that links the future of California's power grid to the global boom in artificial intelligence (AI). A clear signal of shifting sentiment appeared on July 25, when the trading volume of bullish call options for PG&E stock soared by over 380% compared to its daily average. A call option gives an investor the right to buy a stock at a specific price in the future, making it a direct bet on a price increase. A surge of this magnitude signals a wave of new confidence. A closer look at the trading data shows significant interest in options expiring in September 2025 with ""strike prices"" of $16, $19, and $20 per share. With PG&E’s stock price currently trading in the 13-14 range, this pattern reveals that investors are positioning for a sustained rally. They are betting on a potential upside of 20% to 50% over the coming months, which raises a critical question: What fundamentals justify such optimism? The justification for this bullish sentiment is found in the company's second-quarter 2025 earnings report. The results paint a picture of a business that is successfully stabilizing its operations and finances. The company confidently reaffirmed its full-year non-GAAP core earnings per share (EPS) guidance of $1.48 to $1.52. This signals that management's plan is on track, providing the predictability investors value. This stability is built on a foundation of tangible operational achievements that reduce risk. The company is also managing its regulatory environment more proactively. It recently submitted its smallest rate increase request in a decade. While legislative debates in Sacramento remain a key watch item, earnings call that the company's $63 billion, five-year financial plan can withstand various outcomes, CEO Patti Poppe stated on the call without diluting shareholder value by issuing new stock at current prices. While a stable foundation is essential, the catalyst igniting genuine investor excitement is a powerful, new growth engine. PG&E’s earnings report revealed that demand for its new data center pipeline has swelled to an immense 10 gigawatts. This surge is a direct result of the artificial intelligence revolution centered in PG&E’s Northern California service area. The massive server farms required for AI development consume vast amounts of electricity, giving PG&E a unique growth opportunity that most other utilities lack. For investors, this new demand is the engine of future profit. Meeting this demand will require billions in new infrastructure investment. For a regulated utility, these capital investments are added to its rate base, which is the core asset portfolio on which the company earns a guaranteed profit. This growth in the rate base directly supports the company's goal of delivering at least 9% annual EPS growth through 2028. This growth story also presents a winning narrative for customers and regulators. As management explained, every gigawatt of new data center load can reduce residential bills by 1-2%, as the grid's high fixed costs are spread over more sales. Confirmed projects with major tech players like Microsoft NASDAQ: MSFT make this growth feel tangible and imminent, positioning PG&E as a key partner in the AI economy. The recent surge in bullish options trading appears to be a rational market signal indicating PG&E's fundamental transformation. The company is successfully moving beyond its recovery phase by stabilizing its operations and proactively managing its risks. More importantly, it has secured a robust, long-term growth catalyst by positioning itself as the energy backbone for the AI industry. For a company long defined by its past challenges, the narrative is compellingly shifting to one of durable, technology-driven growth.

MarketBeat Week in Review – 07/28 - 08/01,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/marketbeat-week-in-review-07-28-08-01/,"Stocks drifted lower to end the week as economic uncertainty overshadowed strong Magnificent Seven earnings. On July 31, the latest Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index showed a slight uptick in the rate of inflation growth. Then on Friday, the August Jobs report came in lighter than expected. However, that number looked bullish compared with massive downward revisions to the May and June numbers. Investors are also weighing the impact of tariffs now that the August 1 deadline has come and gone. On a more bullish note, reports from several mega-cap technology companies reinforce the reality of the artificial intelligence (AI) trade. Many of these companies will spend billions of dollars over several years to build out an AI infrastructure, creating opportunities in several sectors. Next week will be quieter for economic data, but earnings season will continue to roll along. August itself is typically a quiet week for markets. But that low volume can also lead to high volatility. Count on the MarketBeat analysts to help you separate market signals from noise. Here are some of our most popular articles from this week. Articles by Sam Quirke One week after its earnings report, Tesla Inc. NASDAQ: TSLA stock has given up almost all of its post-earnings gains. However, Sam Quirke pointed out why the long-term upside continues to look bullish as Tesla’s robotics and autonomous vehicle solutions begin to emerge. Amazon.com Inc. NASDAQ: AMZN stock dropped despite a solid earnings report. It’s just one example of how investors had priced growth into the company’s results. Quirke explained the long-term bull case and how investors and traders may want to approach the stock. NVIDIA Corp. NASDAQ: NVDA would appear to be a winner as AI spending shows no signs of slowing down. Quirke pointed to two technical indicators that look bearish for NVDA stock despite continued optimism from analysts. Articles by Chris Markoch Palantir Technologies Inc. NASDAQ: PLTR reports earnings next week. Chris Markoch explained why investors will want to pay close attention to the company’s growing defense business as the company becomes the Pentagon’s go-to AI engine. Stocks that form a golden cross pattern can be opportunities for investors. Markoch highlighted three stocks that have recently made a golden cross that is supported by strong fundamentals. Apple Inc. NASDAQ: AAPL delivered a strong earnings report on July 31. However, AAPL stock is delivering muted gains. Markoch explained why investors are skeptical about the sustainability of the company’s results, and what that may mean for a stock that many believe is still priced for perfection. Articles by Ryan Hasson Bitcoin has made a resurgence in July, and this time it’s bringing other tokens with it. This week, Ryan Hasson looked at five stocks set to ride the wave of the crypto surge that investors can own without owning and storing the digital assets. Autonomous technology is the bullish cousin to artificial intelligence. This week, Hasson looked at this sector and provided investors with five autonomous technology stocks trading for less than $15. That means there’s some risk and the potential for outsized gains for patient investors. Hasson also looked at two cybersecurity stocks that are poised for a breakout. As interest in AI continues to grow, so will the threats from AI-driven cyberattacks. Hasson explained why upcoming earnings may be the catalyst that moves these stocks higher. Articles by Gabriel Osorio-Mazilli This week, Gabriel Osorio-Mazilli analyzed the surge in American Eagle Outfitters Inc. NYSE: AEO. More importantly, he looked beyond the noise and explained why the move in AEO stock may have more behind it than speculation. With so many stocks trading at or near all-time highs, it can be hard to find undervalued stocks. However, that’s exactly what Osorio-Mazilli did this week. Not only did he provide investors with the names of three undervalued stocks, but he also pointed out why each has catalysts that the market may be overlooking. Buy-and-hold investors understand the importance of compounding. This week, Osorio-Mazilli pointed these investors to three stocks with attractive outlooks for compounding for years to come. Articles by Leo Miller Investors expected a strong earnings report from Meta Platforms Inc. NASDAQ: META, and the company did not disappoint. Leo Miller summarized the tech giant's strong report and explained why investors should be willing to chase META stock higher. Earnings season is a time when investors seek out analyst upgrades. This week, Miller highlighted three AI stocks that have received bullish upgrades after reporting strong earnings. Earnings season can also be synonymous with stock buybacks. Although that hasn’t been a prominent factor so far in this cycle, Miller highlighted four stocks that have announced significant increases in Q2 buybacks. Articles by Nathan Reiff D-Wave Quantum Inc. NYSE: QBTS has been one of the best-performing stocks in the emerging quantum stock sector. This week, Nathan Reiff pointed out the catalysts that briefly allowed QBTS stock to make a new all-time high, but why investors may still want to proceed with caution. Investors have been waiting for basic materials stocks to take off. However, uncertainty in key economic indicators has weighed on these stocks. Reiff explained why three material stocks are likely to have further upside based on fundamentals and market trends. Defense stocks have been some of the most closely watched stocks for investors. Reiff pointed out why a beaten-down small-cap stock, Byrna Technologies Inc. NASDAQ: BYRN, is one to watch based on bullish analyst sentiment and a strong earnings report. Articles by Dan Schmidt History frequently rhymes, and Dan Schmidt pointed out why 2025 is starting to look a lot like 2021. In both cases, traders were looking for short squeeze candidates. This is a risky strategy, but it can be profitable. Schmidt highlighted three stocks with catalysts that could make them good short-squeeze candidates. It hasn’t been all bad news on the tariff front, Schmidt pointed out why the recent deal between the United States and Japan is bullish for automotive stocks. Schmidt highlighted three automaker stocks that investors may be overlooking. Articles by Jeffrey Neal Johnson “The quantum computing industry is reaching an inflection point.” Jeffrey Neal Johnson highlighted this issue for investors. Johnson explained the key factors driving quantum stocks higher and gave investors three stocks that are among the most promising for long-term investors. Drone stocks have been soaring, which is why Johnson made it a point to highlight Red Cat Holdings Inc. NASDAQ: RCAT. The stock has dropped recently, but a new contract is only one reason why analysts believe there’s significant upside to come. As the AI revolution progresses, investors will want to watch applications on the edge. This week, Johnson pointed out that its application of semiconductors in automotive and internet of Things (IoT) applications makes Qualcomm Inc. NASDAQ: QCOM a growth stock that may be flying under the radar. Articles by Jordan Chussler Healthcare is normally an evergreen sector for investors. However, that hasn’t been the case for several years. Jordan Chussler analyzed the headwinds impacting the healthcare sector and why that adds to the bullish case for HCA Healthcare Inc. NYSE: HCA, which recently issued bullish forward guidance. Before you consider HCA Healthcare, you'll want to hear this.

SpaceX delivers four astronauts to the International Space Station just 15 hours after launch,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/astronauts-take-express-flight-to-the-space-station-arriving-15-hours-after-their-launch-2025-08-02/,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — SpaceX delivered a fresh crew to the International Space Station on Saturday, making the trip in a quick 15 hours. The four U.S., Russian and Japanese astronauts pulled up in their SpaceX capsule after launching from NASA's Kennedy Space Center. They will spend at least six months at the orbiting lab, swapping places with colleagues up there since March. SpaceX will bring those four back as early as Wednesday. Moving in are NASA's Zena Cardman and Mike Fincke, Japan's Kimiya Yui and Russia's Oleg Platonov — each of whom had been originally assigned to other missions. “Hello, space station!” Fincke radioed as soon as the capsule docked high above the South Pacific. Cardman and another astronaut were pulled from a SpaceX flight last year to make room for NASA's two stuck astronauts, Boeing Starliner test pilots Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, whose space station stay went from one week to more than nine months. Fincke and Yui had been training for the next Starliner mission. But with Starliner grounded by thruster and other problems until 2026, the two switched to SpaceX. Platonov was bumped from the Soyuz launch lineup a couple of years ago because of an undisclosed illness. Their arrival temporarily puts the space station population at 11. “It was such an unbelievably beautiful sight to see the space station come into our view for the first time,” Cardman said once on board. While their taxi flight was speedy by U.S. standards, the Russians hold the record for the fastest trip to the space station — a lightning-fast three hours. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

It's Trump's economy now. The latest financial numbers offer some warning signs,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/its-trumps-economy-now-the-latest-financial-numbers-offer-some-warning-signs-2025-08-01/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — For all of President Donald Trump’s promises of an economic “golden age,” a spate of weak indicators this week told a potentially worrisome story as the impacts of his policies are coming into focus. Job gains are dwindling. Inflation is ticking upward. Growth has slowed compared with last year. More than six months into his term, Trump’s blitz of tariff hikes and his new tax and spending bill have remodeled America’s trading, manufacturing, energy and tax systems to his own liking. He’s eager to take credit for any wins that might occur and is hunting for someone else to blame if the financial situation starts to totter. But as of now, this is not the boom the Republican president promised, and his ability to blame his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden, for any economic challenges has faded as the world economy hangs on his every word and social media post. When Friday’s jobs report turned out to be decidedly bleak, Trump ignored the warnings in the data and fired the head of the agency that produces the monthly jobs figures. “Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can’t be manipulated for political purposes,” Trump said on Truth Social, without offering evidence for his claim. “The Economy is BOOMING.” It’s possible that the disappointing numbers are growing pains from the rapid transformation caused by Trump and that stronger growth will return — or they may be a preview of even more disruption to come. Trump's aggressive use of tariffs, executive actions, spending cuts and tax code changes carries significant political risk if he is unable to deliver middle-class prosperity. The effects of his new tariffs are still several months away from rippling through the economy, right as many Trump allies in Congress will be campaigning in the midterm elections. “Considering how early we are in his term, Trump’s had an unusually big impact on the economy already,” said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist at Firehouse Strategies. “The full inflationary impact of the tariffs won’t be felt until 2026. Unfortunately for Republicans, that’s also an election year.” The White House portrayed the blitz of trade frameworks leading up to Thursday's tariff announcement as proof of his negotiating prowess. The European Union, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Indonesia and other nations that the White House declined to name agreed that the U.S. could increase its tariffs on their goods without doing the same to American products. Trump simply set rates on other countries that lacked settlements. The costs of those tariffs — taxes paid on imports to the U.S. — will be most felt by many Americans in the form of higher prices, but to what extent remains uncertain. “For the White House and their allies, a key part of managing the expectations and politics of the Trump economy is maintaining vigilance when it comes to public perceptions,” said Kevin Madden, a Republican strategist. Just 38% of adults approve of Trump’s handling of the economy, according to a July poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs. That’s down from the end of Trump’s first term when half of adults approved of his economic leadership. The White House paints a rosier image, seeing the economy emerging from a period of uncertainty after Trump’s restructuring and repeating the economic gains seen in his first term before the pandemic struck. “President Trump is implementing the very same policy mix of deregulation, fairer trade, and pro-growth tax cuts at an even bigger scale – as these policies take effect, the best is yet to come,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said. The economic numbers over the past week show the difficulties that Trump might face if the numbers continue on their current path: — Friday's jobs report showed that U.S. employers have shed 37,000 manufacturing jobs since Trump's tariff launch in April, undermining prior White House claims of a factory revival. — Net hiring has plummeted over the past three months with job gains of just 73,000 in July, 14,000 in June and 19,000 in May — a combined 258,000 jobs lower than previously indicated. On average last year, the economy added 168,000 jobs a month. — A Thursday inflation report showed that prices have risen 2.6% over the year that ended in June, an increase in the personal consumption expenditures price index from 2.2% in April. Prices of heavily imported items, such as appliances, furniture, and toys and games, jumped from May to June. — On Wednesday, a report on gross domestic product — the broadest measure of the U.S. economy — showed that it grew at an annual rate of less than 1.3% during the first half of the year, down sharply from 2.8% growth last year. “The economy's just kind of slogging forward,” said Guy Berger, senior fellow at the Burning Glass Institute, which studies employment trends. “Yes, the unemployment rate’s not going up, but we’re adding very few jobs. The economy’s been growing very slowly. It just looks like a ‘meh’ economy is continuing.” Trump has sought to pin the blame for any economic troubles on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, saying the Fed should cut its benchmark interest rates even though doing so could generate more inflation. Trump has publicly backed two Fed governors, Christoper Waller and Michelle Bowman, for voting for rate cuts at Wednesday's meeting. But their logic is not what the president wants to hear: They were worried, in part, about a slowing job market. But this is a major economic gamble being undertaken by Trump and those pushing for lower rates under the belief that mortgages will also become more affordable as a result and boost homebuying activity. His tariff policy has changed repeatedly over the last six months, with the latest import tax numbers serving as a substitute for what the president announced in April, which provoked a stock market sell-off. It might not be a simple one-time adjustment as some Fed board members and Trump administration officials argue. Of course, Trump can't say no one warned him about the possible consequences of his economic policies. Biden, then the outgoing president, did just that in a speech last December at the Brookings Institution, saying the cost of the tariffs would eventually hit American workers and businesses. “He seems determined to impose steep, universal tariffs on all imported goods brought into this country on the mistaken belief that foreign countries will bear the cost of those tariffs rather than the American consumer,” Biden said. “I believe this approach is a major mistake.” Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

"Who is Erika McEntarfer, the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner fired by Trump?",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/who-is-erika-mcentarfer-the-bureau-of-labor-statistics-commissioner-fired-by-trump-2025-08-01/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The head of the agency that compiles the closely watched monthly jobs report usually toils in obscurity, but on Friday, the current holder of that job was loudly fired by the president of the United States. Erika McEntarfer, a longtime government employee, bore the brunt of President Donald Trump’s unhappiness with Friday’s jobs report, which showed that hiring had slowed in July and was much less in May and June that previously estimated. He accused her without evidence of manipulating the job numbers and noted she was an appointee of President Joe Biden. McEntarfer, a longtime government worker who had served as BLS head for a year and a half, did not immediately respond to a request for comment by The Associated Press. But her predecessor overseeing the jobs agency, former co-workers and associates have denounced the firing, warning about its repercussions and saying McEntarfer was nonpolitical in her role. Here’s what to know about Erika McEntarfer: McEntarfer, whose research focuses on job loss, retirement, worker mobility, and wage rigidity, had previously worked at the Census Bureau’s Center for Economic Studies, the Treasury Department’s Office of Tax Policy and the White House Council of Economic Advisers in a nonpolitical role. She has a bachelor's degree in Social Science from Bard College and a doctoral degree in economics from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. McEntarfer was nominated in 2023 to serve as BLS head, and the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions recommended that her nomination go to the full Senate for a vote. She was confirmed as BLS commissioner in January 2024 on a bipartisan 86-8 Senate vote. Among the Republican senators who voted to confirm her included then-Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, who is now Trump's vice president, and then-Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who is now Trump's secretary of state. Before her confirmation hearing, a group called the Friends of the BLS, made up of former commissioners who served in both Democratic and Republican administrations, members of statistical associations and credentialed economists, said McEntarfer's background made her a great choice for the job. “The many reasons to quickly confirm Dr. McEntarfer as the new BLS Commissioner all boil down to this: the agency, like the entire statistical system, is undergoing an intense, significant period of change and Dr. McEntarfer’s wealth of research and statistical experience have equipped her to be the strong leader that BLS needs to meet these challenges,” Friends of the BLS wrote. William Beach, who was appointed BLS commissioner in 2019 by Trump and served until 2023 during President Joe Biden's administration, called McEntarfer's firing “groundless” and said in an X post that it “sets a dangerous precedent and undermines the statistical mission of the Bureau.” Former Labor Department chief economist Sarah J. Glynn, who received regular briefings from McEntarfer about BLS findings, said McEntarfer was generous with her time explaining what conclusions could or couldn’t be reached from the data. If the data didn’t support something an administration official was saying, McEntarfer would say so, Glynn said. She also never weighed in on how the administration should present or interpret the data, Glynn said — she would simply answer questions about the data. “She had a sterling reputation as someone who is concerned about the accuracy of the data and not someone who puts a political spin on her work,” Glynn said. Heather Boushey, a senior research fellow at Harvard University, served with McEntarfer on the White House Council of Economic Advisers and said McEntarfer never talked politics at work. “She showed up every day to focus on the best analysis and the best approach to her field and not get political. That is what I saw from her time and again. She is brilliant and well-respected among labor economists generally,” Boushey said. “She wasn’t coming into my office to talk politics or the political implications of something. She definitely wasn’t engaging on that side of things.” ___ Olson reported from New York. Associated Press writer Christopher Rugaber in Washington contributed to this report.

"American Eagle responds to critics over ad with Sydney Sweeney, saying it was always about the jeans",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/american-eagle-responds-to-critics-over-ad-with-sydney-sweeney-saying-it-was-always-about-the-jeans-2025-08-01/,"NEW YORK (AP) — Teen retailer American Eagle Outfitters has a message to its critics, who took issue over its denim ad campaign with 27-year-old actor Sydney Sweeney that sparked a debate over race and Western beauty standards. The campaign, the retailer said, was always about the jeans. In a statement posted on American Eagle's Instagram account on Friday, the retailer said the ad campaign “is and always was about the jeans. Her jeans. Her story. We'll continue to celebrate how everyone wears their AE jeans with confidence, their way. Great jeans look good on everyone.” The message marked the first time the teen retailer responded to days of backlash since the ad with the tagline “Sydney Sweeney has great jeans” launched last week. In the run-up to the ad blitz, the company's chief marketing officer told trade media outlets that it included “clever, even provocative language” and was “definitely going to push buttons."" It's unclear if the company knew how much controversy the ad could raise. Most of the negative reception focused on videos that used the word “genes” instead of “jeans” when discussing the blonde-haired, blue-eyed actor known for the HBO series “Euphoria” and “White Lotus.” Critics found the most troubling was a teaser video in which Sweeney says, “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color. My jeans are blue.” The video appeared on American Eagle’s Facebook page and other social media channels but is not part of the ad campaign. Some critics saw the wordplay as a nod, either unintentional or deliberate, to eugenics, a discredited theory that held humanity could be improved through selective breeding for certain traits. Other commenters accused detractors of reading too much into the campaign’s message. Some marketing experts said the buzz is always good even if it’s not uniformly positive. “If you try to follow all the rules, you’ll make lots of people happy, but you’ll fail,” Allen Adamson, co-founder of marketing consultancy Metaforce said. “The rocket won’t take off.” Before you consider Meta Platforms, you'll want to hear this.

"Columbia Sportswear sues Columbia University, alleging merchandise too similar and causes confusion",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/columbia-sportswear-sues-columbia-university-alleging-merchandise-too-similar-and-causes-confusion-2025-08-01/,"NEW YORK (AP) — Outerwear retailer Columbia Sportswear has sued Columbia University over alleged trademark infringement and a breach of contract, saying that the university’s merchandise looks too similar to its own offerings and can confuse shoppers. In a lawsuit filed July 23 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon, Columbia Sportswear, whose roots date back to 1938, alleges that the Ivy League university intentionally violated an agreement the parties signed on June 13, 2023. That agreement dictated how the university could use the word “Columbia” on its own apparel and accessories. As part of the pact, the university could feature “Columbia” on its merchandise provided that the name included a recognizable school insignia or its mascot, the word “university,” the name of the academic department or the founding year of the university — 1754 — or a combination. Columbia Sportswear clothing is sold at more than 800 retail locations including more than 150 of its branded stores as well as its website and third-party marketplaces. But Columbia Sportswear alleges the university breached the agreement a little more than a year later, with the Portland, Oregon-based company noticing several garments without any of the school logos being sold at the Columbia University online store. Many of the garments feature a bright blue color that is “confusingly similar” to the blue color that has long been associated with Columbia Sportswear, the suit alleged. The lawsuit offered photos of some of the Columbia University items that say only Columbia. “The likelihood of deception, confusion, and mistake engendered by the university’s misappropriation and misuse of the Columbia name is causing irreparable harm to the brand and goodwill symbolized by Columbia Sportswear’s registered mark Columbia and the reputation for quality it embodies,” the lawsuit alleged. The lawsuit comes at a time when Columbia University has been threatened with the potential loss of billions of dollars in government support. Last week, Columbia University reached a deal with the Trump administration to pay more than $220 million to the federal government to restore federal research money that was canceled in the name of combating antisemitism on campus. Under the agreement, the Ivy League school will pay a $200 million settlement over three years, the university said. Columbia Sportswear aims to stop all sales of clothing that violate the agreement, recall any products already sold and donate any remaining merchandise to charity. Columbia Sportswear is also seeking three times the amount of actual damages determined by a jury. Neither Columbia Sportswear nor Columbia University could be immediately reached for comment.

Will Hims & Hers Fall Along With Novo Nordisk?,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/will-hims-and-hers-fall-along-with-novo-nordisk/,"One of the most widely watched names in the healthcare sector is Hims & Hers Health Inc. NYSE: HIMS, not only due to its rampant price action over the past six months, but also because of its underlying growth story, which almost makes it feel like a miracle in the making. The reason behind its popularity lies in the fact that it combines the safety of health services along with the sort of growth reserved for the technology space of the market. However, most investors have associated Hims & Hers stock with the world of weight loss lately, in a sort of Ozempic boom. Given the company's recent entry into this space, this association has some justification. However, these assumptions overlook the fact that the company was already on a path to success and compounding growth before making this decision. The stakes are particularly high, along with uncertainty, now that shares of Novo Nordisk NYSE: NVO have fallen by as much as 31% over the past month alone. The bearish reaction was triggered by regulatory intervention and investigations into weight loss products, which specifically targeted Novo Nordisk due to its overconcentration in the product and limited diversification. Due to correlation regimes, it is likely that shares of Hims & Hers stock will also experience a slight slump. However, the fundamentals dictate that the decline shouldn’t be as harsh as it was for Novo Nordisk. With a diversified product offering and a completely different business model, here is why Hims & Hers might make it out okay. Hims & Hers leverages the world of telehealth in a way that Novo Nordisk can’t, and that means operating as a remote platform that monetizes through the best way investors tend to look for in every business: Subscriptions. Because over 90% of the company’s revenue comes through subscriptions, Hims & Hers might hold stronger than expected. This is because subscriptions enable investors and Wall Street analysts to more accurately predict future financials in any business, as the churn rate tends to be significantly lower, particularly in healthcare services. With this in mind, the fact that Hims & Hers stock still trades at 95% of its 52-week high should be a strong sign that optimism is still alive. On the other hand, Novo Nordisk has fallen to a dismal 35% of its 52-week high, showing investors how aware the market is that Hims & Hers is not as exposed to weight loss products as Novo Nordisk is today. The probability that this momentum will continue into the future is high, and evidence can be found in the company's fundamentals. Investors examining Hims & Hers' latest quarterly results will see no reason for the stock to decline in the near future, despite some concerns about its weight loss product exposure. Revenue has surged 111% over the past year, clearly indicating strong demand for this innovative health platform. The main driver of this growth is the swift and aggressive adoption rate and ongoing expansion of market share that the company consistently reports. Subscribers grew to 2.4 million, up 38% compared to the same quarter last year. This isn’t just slight price increases per subscription but also attractive growth in the company’s user base, which is the main driver in any technology or subscription-based company. Another factor investors need to keep in mind is that Hims & Hers management reiterated its full-year financial guidance for 2025. This is a strong point, considering that other companies have chosen not to provide guidance due to the current trade tariffs and inflation uncertainty in the economy. One benefit of having a business model as predictable and stable as this one is that it provides certainty in a market where every investor needs it. All told, this financial growth boiled down to one of the most important metrics: free cash flow (operating cash flow minus capital expenditures). Free cash flow was reported at up to $50.1 million for this quarter, which is up nearly fivefold compared to the $11,9 million reported for the same quarter last year. This metric matters because it represents the most raw form of compounding potential, as free cash flow is typically used for reinvestments to drive further growth. All the evidence, both technical momentum and fundamental growth, seems to point to very low chances of Hims & Hers falling with Novo Nordisk, and that is one conviction investors can take for this name moving forward.

AMA and other medical associations are kicked out of CDC vaccine workgroups,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/ama-and-other-medical-associations-are-kicked-out-of-cdc-vaccine-workgroups-2025-08-01/,"NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. health officials have told more than a half-dozen of the nation's top medical organizations that they will no longer help establish vaccination recommendations. The government told the organizations on Thursday via email that their experts are being disinvited from the workgroups that have been the backbone of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. The organizations include the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Infectious Diseases Society of America. “I’m concerned and distressed,” said Dr. William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University vaccine expert who for decades has been involved with ACIP and its workgroups. He said the move will likely propel a confusing fragmentation of vaccine guidance, as patients may hear the government say one thing and hear their doctors say another. One email said the organizations are “special interest groups and therefore are expected to have a ‘bias’ based on their constituency and/or population that they represent.” A federal health official on Friday confirmed the action, which was first reported by Bloomberg. The decision was the latest development in what has become a saga involving the ACIP. The committee, created in 1964, makes recommendations to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on how vaccines that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration should be used. CDC directors have traditionally almost always approved those recommendations, which are widely heeded by doctors and greenlight insurance coverage for shots. U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was a leading voice in the anti-vaccine movement before becoming the U.S. government’s top health official, and in June abruptly fired the entire ACIP after accusing them of being too closely aligned with manufacturers. He handpicked replacements that include several vaccine skeptics. The workgroups typically include committee members and experts from medical and scientific organizations. At workgroup meetings, members evaluate data from vaccine manufacturers and the CDC, and formulate vaccination recommendation proposals to be presented to the full committee. The structure was created for several reasons, Schaffner said. The professional groups provide input about what might and might not be possible for doctors to implement. And it helped build respect and trust in ACIP recommendations, having the buy-in of respected medical organizations, he said. Workgroup members are vetted for conflicts of interest, to make sure than no one who had, say, made money from working on a hepatitis vaccine was placed on the hepatitis committee, Schaffner noted. Also disinvited from the groups were the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American College of Physicians, the American Geriatrics Society, the American Osteopathic Association, the National Medical Association and the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. In a joint statement Friday, the AMA and several of the other organizations said: “To remove our deep medical expertise from this vital and once transparent process is irresponsible, dangerous to our nation’s health, and will further undermine public and clinician trust in vaccines.” They urged the administration to reconsider the move ""so we can continue to feel confident in its vaccine recommendations for our patients.” Some of the professional organizations have criticized Kennedy’s changes to the ACIP, and three of the disinvited groups last month joined a lawsuit against the government over Kennedy’s decision to stop recommending COVID-19 vaccines for most children and pregnant women. In a social media post Friday, one of the Kennedy-appointed ACIP members — Retsef Levi — wrote that the working groups “will engage experts from even broader set of disciplines!” Levi, a business management professor, also wrote that working group membership “will be based on merit & expertise — not membership in organizations proven to have (conflicts of interest) and radical & narrow view of public health!” HHS officials have not said which people are going to be added to the ACIP workgroups. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

The S&P 500 fell 1.6% Friday, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.2%. The Nasdaq composite lost 2.2%.

"Federal Reserve Governor Kugler steps down, giving Trump slot to fill",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/federal-reserve-governor-kugler-steps-down-giving-trump-slot-to-fill-2025-08-01/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve announced Friday that governor Adriana Kugler will step down next week, opening up a spot on the central bank's powerful board that President Donald Trump will be able to fill. Kugler, who did not participate in the Fed's policy meeting earlier this week, would have completed her term in January. Instead, she will retire Aug. 8. She did not provide a reason for stepping down in her resignation letter. Federal Reserve governors vote on the central bank's interest rate decisions and also on changes to bank regulations and other financial rules. The Trump administration could take advantage of Kugler's resignation and appoint a potential replacement for Fed Chair Jerome Powell to replace her. Powell, who has been repeatedly attacked by Trump for not reducing the Fed's key short-term interest rate, completes his term as chair in May 2026. Trump said Friday afternoon he was “very happy” to have an opportunity to name someone to the Fed's board. Several names have been floated as potential replacements for Powell, including Kevin Hassett, currently a top economic adviser to Trump, and Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor from 2006 to 2011. Asked about potential candidates, Trump said he has “about three very good – I’ve got a lot of good candidates."" Trump has continued his attacks on the Fed since Powell said Wednesday that the central bank would keep its short-term interest rate unchanged. Powell also said the Fed could take months to evaluate the impact of tariffs on the economy before deciding to cut rates, as Trump has demanded. Powell is “a stubborn MORON, must substantially lower interest rates, NOW,"" Trump posted early Friday morning, before the monthly jobs report was released. That report showed hiring slowed in July and was much lower in May and June than had been initially reported. Kugler was appointed to the Fed's seven-member board of governors by former President Joe Biden in September 2023. She was the first Hispanic Fed governor, and prior to joining the Fed, was a professor at Georgetown University and was the U.S. representative to the World Bank. She will return to the Georgetown faculty in the fall. “I am proud to have tackled this role with integrity, a strong commitment to serving the public, and with a data-driven approach strongly based on my expertise in labor markets and inflation,” she said in her resignation letter. In her last speech as a Fed governor two weeks ago, Kugler expressed support for Powell's view that the central bank should keep rates unchanged while officials monitor the economy to see how Trump's tariffs affect inflation and the economy. Trump, meanwhile, has said he will appoint Fed officials who favor cutting rates. One complication is that Powell's term as chair ends in May 2026. But his position on the Fed's governing board lasts through January 2028. As a result, he could stay on the board even after stepping down as chair, and simply remain as one of seven governors. There is some precedent for such a step: Marriner Eccles, who served as Fed chair in the 1930s, remained on the board after completing his term as chair. If Powell took such a step, that would mean whomever the Trump administration chose to replace Kugler could then be elevated to chair after Powell finishes as chair in May 2026. In other words, to get their choice of Fed Chair in 2026, the Trump White House may choose to appoint that person to replace Kugler as governor, and then elevate them to Fed chair in May 2026. Powell has declined to answer at the last two press conferences whether he will leave the board when he is done as chair. ____ AP Writer Will Weissert contributed to this report.

"NFL on the verge of selling media assets to ESPN for an equity stake in the network, AP sources say",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/nfl-on-the-verge-of-selling-media-assets-to-espn-for-an-equity-stake-in-the-network-ap-source-says-2025-08-01/,"The NFL and ESPN are expected to announce an agreement next week under which most of the league's significant media holdings would go to the sports network. People familiar with the transaction said the multibillion-dollar deal would give the NFL an equity stake in ESPN. The people spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the deal has not been finalized. It was first reported by The Athletic. The NFL and ESPN had no comment. The NFL has been trying to sell its media properties for nearly five years. ESPN and the league have been involved in on-again, off-again talks for the past three years. The proposed move comes as ESPN is expected to soon launch its direct-to-consumer service, possibly before the end of August. The service would give cord cutters access to all of ESPN's programs and networks for $29.99 per month. Most cable, satellite and viewers who have streaming services will receive the service for free as part of their subscription. ESPN would get access to the popular RedZone channel, as well as NFL Network and an additional seven regular-season games (six international and a Saturday afternoon late-season contest). A couple of weeks ago, ESPN announced that NFL Network host Rich Eisen's three-hour program would air on ESPN Radio as well as stream on Disney+ and ESPN+. “The Rich Eisen Show” is not affiliated with NFL Network.

"Corporation for Public Broadcasting to shut down after being defunded by Congress, targeted by Trump",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/corporation-for-public-broadcasting-to-shut-down-after-being-defunded-by-congress-targeted-by-trump-2025-08-01/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a cornerstone of American culture for three generations, announced Friday it would take steps toward its own closure after being defunded by Congress — marking the end of a nearly six-decade era in which it fueled the production of renowned educational programming, cultural content and even emergency alerts. The demise of the corporation, known as CPB, is a direct result of President Donald Trump's targeting of public media, which he has repeatedly said is spreading political and cultural views antithetical to those the United States should be espousing. The closure is expected to have a profound impact on the journalistic and cultural landscape — in particular, public radio and TV stations in small communities across the United States. CPB helps fund both PBS and NPR, but most of its funding is distributed to more than 1,500 local public radio and television stations around the country. The corporation also has deep ties to much of the nation’s most familiar programming, from NPR’s “All Things Considered” to, historically, “Sesame Street,” “Mister Rogers' Neighborhood” and the documentaries of Ken Burns. The corporation said its end, 58 years after being signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson, would come in an “orderly wind-down.” In a statement, it said the decision came after the passage through Congress of a package that clawed back its funding for the next two budget years — about $1.1 billion. Then, the Senate Appropriations Committee reinforced that policy change Thursday by excluding funding for the corporation for the first time in more than 50 years as part of a broader spending bill. “Despite the extraordinary efforts of millions of Americans who called, wrote, and petitioned Congress to preserve federal funding for CPB, we now face the difficult reality of closing our operations,” said Patricia Harrison, the corporation’s president and CEO. Democratic members of the Senate Appropriations Committee made a last-ditch effort this week to save the CBP's funding. As part of Thursday's committee deliberations, Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., authored but then withdrew an amendment to restore CPB funding for the coming budget year. She said she still believed there was a path forward “to fix this before there are devastating consequences for public radio and television stations across the country.” “It's hard to believe we’ve ended up in the situation we’re in,” she said. “And I’m going to continue to work with my colleagues to fix it.” But Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., sounded a less optimistic tone. “I understand your concerns, but we all know we litigated this two weeks ago,” Capito said. “Adopting this amendment would have been contrary to what we have already voted on.” CPB said it informed employees Friday that most staff positions will end with the fiscal year on Sept. 30. It said a small transition team will stay in place until January to finish any remaining work — including, it said, “ensuring continuity for music rights and royalties that remain essential to the public media system.” “Public media has been one of the most trusted institutions in American life, providing educational opportunity, emergency alerts, civil discourse, and cultural connection to every corner of the country,” Harrison said. “We are deeply grateful to our partners across the system for their resilience, leadership, and unwavering dedication to serving the American people.” NPR stations use millions of dollars in federal money to pay music licensing fees. Now, many will have to renegotiate these deals. That could impact, in particular, outlets that build their programming around music discovery. NPR President and CEO Katherine Maher estimated recently, for example, that some 96% of all classical music broadcast in the United States is on public radio stations. Federal money for public radio and television has traditionally been appropriated to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which distributes it to NPR and PBS. Roughly 70% of the money goes directly to the 330 PBS and 246 NPR stations across the country, although that’s only a shorthand way to describe its potential impact. Trump, who has called the CPB a “monstrosity,” has long said that public broadcasting displays an extreme liberal bias, helped create the momentum in recent months for an anti-public broadcasting groundswell among his supporters in Congress and around the country. It is part of a larger initiative in which he has targeted institutions — particularly cultural ones — that produce content or espouse attitudes that he considers “un-American.” The CPB’s demise represents a political victory for those efforts. His impact on the media landscape has been profound. He has also gone after U.S. government media that had independence charters, including the venerable Voice of America, ending that media outlet’s operations after many decades. Trump also fired three members of the corporation’s board of directors in April. In legal action at the time, the fired directors said their dismissal was governmental overreach targeting an entity whose charter guarantees it independence. ___ Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

Play It Cool: Why Comfort Systems USA Is a Hidden AI Winner,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/play-it-cool-why-comfort-systems-usa-is-a-hidden-ai-winner/,"Suppose you heard mention of a stock that’s ridden the artificial intelligence wave to a 1,300% gain over the last five years. In that scenario, you’d probably envision industries like semiconductors, computer software, or maybe cybersecurity. You’d likely NOT think of an industrial conglomerate that installs air conditioning, but sometimes markets have a sense of humor. One of the AI revolution’s biggest winners has been Comfort Systems USA Inc. NYSE: FIX, a $25 billion HVAC company reaping the benefits of the data center gold rush. If its order backlog is any indication, FIX investors will be staying cool well into next year. Artificial intelligence agents may not need to eat, drink, or sleep like humans, but they do need the temperature to be just right. AI data centers consume tremendous amounts of energy, with a significant portion of that energy being used for sophisticated cooling systems. If you think your energy bills are high in the summer, imagine trying to keep hundreds of thousands of NVIDIA Corp. NASDAQ: NVDA GPUs from overheating under unprecedented usage. AI superscalers require specialized HVAC solutions to meet their rapidly expanding needs, with data center cooling expected to become a $42 billion industry by 2032. That’s a 12.4% compound annual growth rate! This quickly growing market is precisely what companies like Comfort Systems USA are capitalizing on with innovative and customized HVAC solutions. Comfort Systems USA is actually 45 different companies in one, operating across a vast swath of the U.S. in services like construction, property maintenance, automation controls, and mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) systems. Their expertise in the latter area gives the company an advantage when working with AI data centers. Using a strategy called Modular Construction, FIX can fabricate crucial components like air handling units or utility plants off-site and then install them on location. This technique was designed to reduce costs and lead times but also creates a safer construction site environment and enhances quality control. The company’s Immersion Cooling is another innovative solution AI hyperscalers crave, as it supplies data centers with precise temperature management systems so servers can be packed closer together, thereby saving on energy consumption. Most importantly, modular construction allows Comfort Systems USA to scale projects quickly. And if Meta Platforms Inc. NASDAQ: META and Microsoft Corp. NASDAQ: MSFT earnings this week provide any hints, the demand for data center equipment is only going up from here. What makes an industrial sector stock jump 22% in a day? An earnings report like the one Comfort Systems USA delivered on July 24. The company comfortably topped revenue projections, growing sales 20% year-over-year (YOY) with gross margins jumping from 20.1% to 23.5%. The $6.53 EPS figure was nearly double the Q2 number from last year, and the company’s $250 million net cash pile gives it plenty of room for more acquisitions. But the real golden nugget in this report was the company’s backlog, which is blowing away even the most optimistic projections. For the first time in the company’s history, its backlog exceeded $8 billion, jumping from $6.89 billion to $8.12 billion between Q1 and Q2. At this time last year, FIX’s backlog stood at $5.77 billion. Tacking on more than $2 billion in just 12 months (growth of more than 40%!) shows the immense demand for cooling solutions from AI data centers, and the company seems to have no problem shifting its growing tariff burdens onto customers. A backlog of this magnitude indicates that FIX is well-positioned to continue growing revenue at a rapid pace into 2026 and beyond. Following the report, FIX stock received its highest analyst price boost yet, a $810 price target from DA Davidson, which suggests further upside of at least 15%. Comfort Systems USA is giving investors plenty of reasons to be bullish, and the daily chart also shows an uptrend firmly intact following a Golden Cross signal last month and a parabolic jump following earnings. The 50-day moving average was established as a support level in the days before the report, and volume spiked to its highest level since April following the release.  If there’s a fly in the ointment, it's short-term trading signals like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) hinting at an overextended rally. The RSI screeched higher to 82, well above the 70 number typically considered Oversold territory. The RSI rolling average is also creeping near 70, and the stock traded down in the two days following earnings. Profit-taking following a 60% year-to-date (YTD) gain is never a bad idea, and new investors might find a better entry point later in the next few weeks, once the post-earnings volatility subsides.

Trump removes official overseeing jobs data after dismal employment report,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-seeks-to-fire-official-overseeing-jobs-data-after-weak-employment-report-2025-08-01/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Friday removed the head of the agency that produces the monthly jobs figures after a report showed hiring slowed in July and was much weaker in May and June than previously reported. Trump, in a post on his social media platform, alleged that the figures were manipulated for political reasons and said that Erika McEntarfer, the director of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden, should be fired. He provided no evidence for the charge. “I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY,” Trump said on Truth Social. “She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified.” Trump later posted: “In my opinion, today’s Jobs Numbers were RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad.” The charge that the data was faked is an explosive one that threatens to undercut the political legitimacy of the U.S. government's economic data, which has long been seen as the “gold standard” of economic measurement globally. Economists and Wall Street investors have for decades generally accepted the data as free from political bias. Trump’s move to fire McEntarfer represented another extraordinary assertion of presidential power. He has wielded the authority of the White House to try to control the world’s international trade system, media companies, America’s top universities and Congress’ constitutional power of the purse, among other institutions. McEntarfer's firing was roundly condemned by a group that included two former BLS commissioners, including William Beach, who was appointed by Trump to the position. They particularly objected to the charge that the data was altered for political reasons. “This rationale for firing Dr. McEntarfer is without merit and undermines the credibility of federal economic statistics that are a cornerstone of intelligent economic decision-making by businesses, families, and policymakers,” the statement from the group, the Friends of BLS, said. In addition to Beach, the statement was signed by Erica Groshen, BLS commissioner under former President Barack Obama. “Firing the Commissioner ... when the BLS revises jobs numbers down (as it routinely does) threatens to destroy trust in core American institutions, and all government statistics,” Arin Dube, an economist at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, said on X. “I can’t stress how damaging this is.” After Trump's initial post, Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer said on X that McEntarfer was no longer leading the bureau and that William Wiatrowski, the deputy commissioner, would serve as the acting director. “I support the President’s decision to replace Biden’s Commissioner and ensure the American People can trust the important and influential data coming from BLS,” Chavez-DeRemer said. Friday’s jobs report showed that just 73,000 jobs were added last month and that 258,000 fewer jobs were created in May and June than previously estimated. The report suggested that the economy has sharply weakened during Trump's tenure, a pattern consistent with a slowdown in economic growth during the first half of the year and an increase in inflation during June that appeared to reflect the price pressures created by the president's tariffs. “What does a bad leader do when they get bad news? Shoot the messenger,” Democratic Senate Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said in a Friday speech. McEntarfer was nominated by Biden in 2023 and became the Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics in January 2024. Commissioners typically serve four-year terms but since they are political appointees can be fired. The commissioner is the only political appointee of the agency, which has hundreds of career civil servants. The Senate confirmed McEntarfer to her post 86-8, with now Vice President JD Vance among the yea votes. Trump focused much of his ire on the revisions the agency made to previous hiring data. Job gains in May were revised down to just 19,000 from a previously revised 125,000, and for June they were cut to 14,000 from 147,000. In July, only 73,000 positions were added. The unemployment rate ticked up to a still-low 4.2% from 4.1%. “No one can be that wrong? We need accurate Jobs Numbers,” Trump wrote. “She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified. Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can’t be manipulated for political purposes.” Trump has not always been so suspicious of the monthly jobs report and responded enthusiastically after the initial May figures came out on June 6, when it was initially reported that the economy added 139,000 jobs. “GREAT JOB NUMBERS, STOCK MARKET UP BIG!” Trump posted at the time. That estimate was later revised down to 125,000 jobs, prior to the most recent revision down to just 19,000. During the 2016 campaign, Trump was more critical: He often attacked the jobs figures as they showed the unemployment rate steadily declining while Obama was still president, only to immediately switch to praising the data once he was in office, as steady job gains continued. The monthly employment report is one of the most closely-watched pieces of government economic data and can cause sharp swings in financial markets. The disappointing figure sent U.S. market indexes about 1.5% lower on Friday. The revisions to the May and June numbers were quite large and surprising to many economists. At the same time, every monthly jobs report includes revisions to the prior two months' figures. Those revisions occur as the government receives more responses from businesses to its survey, which helps provide a more complete picture of employment trends each month. In the past decade, companies have taken longer to respond, which may have contributed to larger monthly revisions. The proportion of companies responding to the surveys has also fallen steadily over the past 10 years, but the survey still gets responses from roughly 200,000 business locations, which can be independent companies or franchises of larger chains. The monthly jobs report has long been closely guarded within the BLS, with early copies held in safes under lock and key to prevent any leaks or early dissemination.

"Online creators, led by MrBeast and Mark Rober, want to raise $40 million for clean water access",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/online-creators-led-by-mrbeast-and-mark-rober-want-to-raise-40-million-for-clean-water-access-2025-08-01/,"NEW YORK (AP) — Online creators from dozens of countries, led by MrBeast and popular science YouTuber Mark Rober, are launching a $40 million fundraiser to build water quality projects around the world. The monthlong crowdfunding campaign, touted as the biggest YouTube collaboration and called #TeamWater, promises to rally their combined 2 billion subscribers around combating unsafe water sources. Funds will primarily benefit WaterAid, an international nonprofit that builds community-tailored infrastructure ranging from solar-powered wells to rainwater harvesting systems. More than 2 billion people lacked access to safely managed drinking water as of 2022, according to the United Nations. Organizers want to put a dent in that figure by providing sustainable access for 2 million people — and instilling new generations with a lifelong commitment to advocacy. Joining #TeamWater are smaller creators and some of the biggest names online such as streaming giant Kai Cenat, trendy YouTubers the Stokes Twins and sports entertainers Dude Perfect. Whether they are filming serious explainers or silly water-themed challenges, creators are encouraged to produce content that is authentic to their brand. Water access was identified as a solvable issue that could also unite their mass global following. But MrBeast CEO Jeff Housenbold acknowledged they are better awareness builders than infield executors So, they sought a partner with global reach, existing community partnerships and long-term change-making abilities. That led them to WaterAid. The organization first started talking with MrBeast's team two years ago, according to WaterAid America CEO Kelly Parsons. She said WaterAid typically engages communities for up to a year designing the proper solution. That work sometimes involves training local water technicians. “It all begins and ends in the communities we work with and through them to ensure design that lasts,” Parsons said. “It’s about people more than about plumbing.” While WaterAid would did not provide a list of all the places where funds would go, countries include Colombia, Bangladesh, Ecuador, Malawi and Kenya. Charity partners GivePower and the Alok Foundation are also helping implementation in rural Kenya and Brazil, respectively. U.S.-based projects include an atmospheric water generator for an assisted living facility in Jackson, Mississippi, where the fragile water system nearly collapsed three years ago. The nonprofit DigDeep is helping fix crumbling infrastructure in the small town of Rhodell, West Virginia. Alex and Alan Stokes, whose 129 million subscribers make them one of YouTube's biggest channels, filmed in a Nepalese village where the campaign is building a 15,000-liter tank. The trip recalled their own upbringing in a Chinese town where their grandfather walked miles to fill 5-gallon water jugs. “Being there in person was definitely one of those experiences that brought it all back for us,” Alex said. “(We) saw these kids there and it just reminded us a lot of our childhood as well.” The multi-platform drive follows the 2019 #TeamTrees and 2021 #TeamSeas campaigns, which reportedly drew more than $50 million altogether. That money helped plant millions of trees and remove millions of pounds of waste from bodies of water. Those humanitarian efforts, however, drew criticism that they promoted oversimplified solutions to complicated issues and applied Band-Aids instead of addressing the main drivers of forest loss or ocean pollution. “Ideally, you would not use philanthropy simply to take away the symptoms of whatever is the problem,"" said Patricia Illingworth, a Northeastern University philosophy professor who writes about ethics in philanthropy. ""But, rather, you would want to address the root cause.” Matt Fitzgerald, a digital campaign strategist who has organized the efforts, said the campaigns were never intended to be the “end all be all."" He hopes they serve as an entry point for deeper commitments. While the previous two campaigns were about “a fist-bump, Mother Earth-style of environmentalism,” he said, this one seeks to center people while still “keeping the planet top of mind.” “No matter how big a mass internet mobilization moment might be, real progress on these issues demands people continuing to pay attention and continuing to stay involved,” Fitzgerald said. ""To me, the way you do that, is you reach people’s hearts before you try to convince them with their minds.” ___ Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.
