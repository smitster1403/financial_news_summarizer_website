"As the going gets tough in South Sudan, some artisans offer cheap footwear made from rubber tires",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/as-the-going-gets-tough-in-south-sudan-some-artisans-offer-cheap-footwear-made-from-rubber-tires-2025-07-18/,"WAU, South Sudan (AP) — From Rwanda to Kenya, fashioning footwear from discarded tires has long been a mark of local ingenuity. In South Sudan, however, the creative work of such artisans is now fueled by an economic crisis that has left the government on the verge of bankruptcy and many people struggling to put food on the table. As South Sudan’s oil revenues have dwindled, the government for months has been unable to pay civil servants on time. The cash crisis affects everyone from soldiers to teachers, underscoring the range of economic hardship across the country, and many are looking for ways to keep going. Some want cheap shoes, finding them not in supermarkets but in open markets where flip-flops and sandals are fashioned from worn-out tires usually thrown away as rubbish. In Wau, some 650 kilometers (400 miles) from the South Sudanese capital of Juba, shoemaker Emmanuel Achuil works under the shade of a tarpaulin in the town's bustling main market. His hands blackened from grappling with rubber, Achuil uses a blade to carve pieces from discarded tires. Colorful straps are scattered around him like pieces of a puzzle. Achuil, who makes five to 10 pairs a week, told the AP that in recent months he’s seen a rise in demand that he and others say is directly related to the rising cost of living here. They say footwear made from scraps of rubber has found a firm place in local markets, confirmed in the ubiquitous displays of such shoes even in open markets in Juba. Two years ago, Achuil was getting five to seven customers a month. Now he expects up to 20 of them, he said. Achuil’s shoes can fetch up to 15,000 South Sudanese pounds a pair, or roughly $4, depending on size and quality of finishing. In addition to their affordability, the rough-hewn pairs are praised for their durability. “Even when things get bad — no food, no jobs — this work doesn’t fail me,” Achuil said. “People always need shoes, especially cheap ones.” Akol Majok Ring, a cattle-keeper from the state of Warrap, said he discovered these sandals in March and immediately bought a pair for himself because “they are good for cattle grazing.” “When you’re moving with the cattle all day, these sandals are perfect,"" he said. “They’re durable and well-suited for the job.” The South Sudanese pound has been under pressure since 2023, losing much of its value against the dollar as oil exports are sporadically disrupted by civil war in neighboring Sudan. The economy has been in decline for five consecutive years, hampered by violence stemming mostly from the political contest between President Salva Kiir and his deputy Riek Machar, who is currently under house arrest for alleged subversion. Hyperinflation and widespread food insecurity affect nearly 80% of South Sudan's 11 million people, the same number of people living below the poverty line, according to the World Bank. South Sudan depends on oil revenues to meet 90% of the government’s annual budget, but damage earlier this year to the oil pipeline through Sudan left South Sudanese authorities briefly unable to export any crude. The government announced earlier in June that exports were due to resume after repairs to the pipeline. Many government workers are effectively without pay, and unemployment is rampant even as the prices of basic goods skyrocket. Leather shoes in the shops can seem a luxury in these circumstances. “Tire soles last longer,” said Deng Akol Athuai, who has been buying from Achuil for years. “I buy one pair, and it lasts me a year or more. They’re strong, especially for walking on rough roads.” Gabriel Bataku, a 26-year-old who is unemployed in Wau, said of artisans that they “are solving real problems. They just need recognition and support.” Achuil has been making shoes since 1996. He is not formally trained. He got his skills as a grade schooler watching older men in their workshops as they went about their business. In those days discarded tires were much easier to find, scavenged from garages or sourced through people throwing them away. But now, he said, “more people are doing this work, so the competition for materials is high.” He lamented the lack of formal support, from the government and others, that has left artisans struggling to access the tools of their trade. He wants access to better equipment. Despite the difficulties, he dreams of opening a proper workshop where he would train others. He also hopes to be able to expand his business to other towns in South Sudan. “If I had better cutting tools, and a way to expand, I could train young people,” he said. “Many are idle here in Wau. This skill could help them survive.” ___ For more on Africa and development: https://apnews.com/hub/africa-pulse The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

"Did money or politics cause Colbert cancellation? Either way, the economics are tough for TV",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/did-money-or-politics-cause-colbert-cancellation-either-way-the-economics-are-tough-for-tv-2025-07-18/,"CBS says its decision to end Stephen Colbert’s late-night comedy show is financial, not political. Yet even with the ample skepticism about that explanation, there's no denying the economics were not working in Colbert's favor. The network’s bombshell announcement late Thursday that the “Late Show” will end next May takes away President Donald Trump’s most prominent TV critic and the most popular entertainment program in its genre. The television industry's declining economic health means similar hard calls are already being made with personalities and programming, with others to be faced in the future. For the late-night genre, there are unique factors to consider. As recently as 2018, broadcast networks took in an estimated $439 million in advertising revenue for its late-night programs, according to the advertising firm Guidelines. Last year, that number dwindled to $220 million. Late-night TV was a particular draw for young men, considered the hardest-to-get and most valuable demographic for advertisers. Increasingly, these viewers are turning to streaming services, either to watch something else entirely or catch highlights of the late-night shows, which are more difficult for the networks to monetize. More broadly, the much-predicted takeover of viewers by streaming services is coming to pass. The Nielsen company reported that during the last two months, for the first time ever, more people consumed programming on services like YouTube and Netflix than on ABC, CBS and NBC or any cable network. Networks and streamers spent roughly $70 billion on entertainment shows and $30 billion for sports rights last year, said Brian Wieser, CEO of Madison & Wall, an advertising consultant and data services firm. Live sports is the most dependable magnet for viewers and costs for its rights are expected to increase 8% a year over the next decade. With television viewership declining in general, it's clear where savings will have to come from. Wieser said he does not know whether Colbert's show is profitable or not for CBS and parent company Paramount Global, but he knows the direction in which it is headed. “The economics of television are weak,” he said. In a statement announcing the cancellation, George Cheeks, Paramount Global's president and chief executive officer, said that “This is purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night. It is not related in any way to the show’s performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.” Cheeks' problem is that not everyone believes him. Colbert is a relentless critic of Trump, and earlier this week pointedly criticized Paramount's decision to settle Trump's lawsuit against CBS over a “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris. He called Paramount's $16 million payment to Trump a “big fat bribe,” since the company is seeking the administration's approval of its merger with Skydance Media. On Friday, the Writers Guild of America called for an investigation by New York's attorney general into whether Colbert's cancellation is itself a bribe, “sacrificing free speech to curry favor with the Trump administration as the company looks for merger approval.” CBS' decision made this a pivotal week for the future of television and radio programming. Congress stripped federal funding for PBS and NPR, threatening the future of shows on those outlets. Journey Gunderson, executive director of the National Comedy Center, called the decision to end Colbert's show the end of an era. “Late-night television has historically been one of comedy's most audience-accessible platforms — a place where commentary meets community, night after night,” Gunderson said. “This isn't just the end of a show. It's the quiet removal of one of the few remaining platforms for daily comedic commentary. Trump, who has called in the past for CBS to terminate Colbert's contract, celebrated the show's upcoming demise. “I absolutely love that Colbert got fired,” the president wrote on Truth Social. “His talent was even less than his ratings.” Some experts questioned whether CBS could have explored other ways to save money on Colbert. NBC, for example, has cut costs by eliminating the band on Seth Meyers' late-night show and curtailing Jimmy Fallon's “Tonight” show to four nights a week. Could CBS have saved more money by cutting off the show immediately, instead of letting it run until next May, which sets up an awkward “lame duck” period? Then again, Colbert will keep working until his contract runs out; CBS would have had to keep paying him anyway. CBS recently cancelled the “After Midnight” show that ran after Colbert. But the network had signaled earlier this year that it was prepared to continue that show until host Taylor Tomlinson decided that she wanted to leave, noted Bill Carter, author of “The Late Shift.” “It is a very sad day for CBS that they are getting out of the late-night race,” Andy Cohen, host of Bravo's “Watch What Happens Live,"" told The Associated Press. “I mean, they are turning off the lights after the news.” Colbert, if he wanted to continue past next May, would likely be able to find a streaming service willing to pay him, Wieser said. But the future of late-night comedy on the entertainment networks is genuinely at risk. Trump, in fact, may outlast his fiercest comic critics. Jon Stewart, once a weeknight fixture, works one night a week at “The Daily Show” for Paramount's Comedy Central, a network that seldom produces much original programming any more. ABC's Jimmy Kimmel, who was chided on social media by Trump on Friday — “I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next” — has a contract that also runs out next year. Kimmel, 57, openly wondered in a Variety interview before signing his latest three-year contract extension how long he wanted to do it. He's hosted his show since 2003. “I have moments where I go, I cannot do this anymore,” Kimmel told Variety in 2022. “And I have moments where I go, what am I gonna do with my life if I'm not doing this anymore?' It's a very complicated thing ... I'm not going to do this forever.” Colbert, Kimmel and Stewart were all nominated for Emmy awards this week. ___ AP journalist Liam McEwan in Los Angeles contributed to this report.

"Lawyer argues Call of Duty maker can't be held responsible for actions of Uvalde, Texas, shooter",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/lawyer-argues-call-of-duty-maker-cant-be-held-responsible-for-actions-of-uvalde-texas-shooter-2025-07-18/,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — A lawyer for the maker of the video game Call of Duty argued Friday that a judge should dismiss a lawsuit brought by families of the victims of the Robb Elementary School attack in Uvalde, Texas, saying the contents of the war game are protected by the First Amendment. The families sued Call of Duty maker Activision and Meta Platforms, which owns Instagram, saying that the companies bear responsibility for promoting products used by the teen gunman. Three sets of parents who lost children in the shooting were in the audience at the Los Angeles hearing. Activision lawyer Bethany Kristovich told Superior Court Judge William Highberger that the “First Amendment bars their claims, period full stop.” “The issues of gun violence are incredibly difficult,” Kristovich said. “The evidence in this case is not.” She argued that the case has little chance of prevailing if it continues, because courts have repeatedly held that “creators of artistic works, whether they be books, music, movies, TV or video games, cannot be held legally liable for the acts of their audience.” The lawsuit, one of many involving Uvalde families, was filed last year on the second anniversary of one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history. The gunman killed 19 students and two teachers. Officers finally confronted and shot him after waiting more than an hour to enter the fourth-grade classroom. Kimberly Rubio, whose 10-year-old daughter Lexi was killed in the shooting, was among the parents who came from Texas to Southern California, where Activision is based, for the hearing. “We traveled all this way, so we need answers,” Rubio said outside the courthouse. ""It's our hope that the case will move forward so we can get those answers."" An attorney for the families argued during the hearing that Call of Duty exceeds its First Amendment protections by moving into marketing. “The basis of our complaint is not the existence of Call of Duty,"" Katie Mesner-Hage told the judge. ""It is using Call of Duty as a platform to market weapons to minors.” The plaintiffs' lawyers showed contracts and correspondence between executives at Activison and gunmakers whose products, they said, are clearly and exactly depicted in the game despite brand names not appearing. Mesner-Hage said the documents show that they actually prefer being unlabeled because “it helps shield them from the implication that they are marketing guns to minors,” while knowing that players will still identify and seek out the weapons. Kristovich said there is no evidence that the kind of product placement and marketing the plaintiffs are talking about happened in any of the editions of the game the shooter played. The families have also filed a lawsuit against Daniel Defense, which manufactured the AR-style rifle used in the May 24, 2022, shooting. Koskoff argued that a replica of the rifle clearly appears on a splash page for Call of Duty. Josh Koskoff, the families' Connecticut-based lead attorney, also represented families of nine Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims in a lawsuit against gunmaker Remington and got a $73 million lawsuit settlement. He invoked Sandy Hook several times in his arguments, saying the shooters there and in Uvalde shared the same gaming obsession. Koskoff said the Uvalde shooter experienced “the absorption and the loss of self in Call of Duty.” He said that immersion was so deep that the shooter searched online for how to obtain an armored suit that he didn't know only exists in the game. Koskoff played a clip from Call of Duty Modern Warfare, the game the shooter played, with a first-person shooter gunning down opponents. The shots echoed loudly in the courtroom, and several people in the audience slowly shook their heads. “Call of Duty is in a class of its own,"" Koskoff said. Kristovich argued for Activision that the game, despite its vast numbers of players, can be tied to only a few of the many U.S. mass shootings. “The game is incredibly common. It appears in a scene on ‘The Office,’"" she said. She added that it is ridiculous to assert that “this is such a horrible scourge that your honor has to essentially ban it through this lawsuit.” Highberger told the lawyers he was not leaning in either direction before the hearing. He gave no time frame for when he will rule, but a quick decision is not expected. The judge did tell the plaintiffs' lawyers that their description of Activision's actions seemed like deliberate malfeasance, where their lawsuit alleges negligence. He said that was the biggest hurdle they needed to clear. “Their conduct created a risk of exactly what happened,” Mesner-Hage told him. “And we represent the people who are exactly the foreseeable victims of that conduct.” Meta's attorneys will make arguments on a similar motion next month.

The owner of the Tennessee factory where workers drowned after Hurricane Helene won't face charges,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/the-owner-of-the-tennessee-factory-where-workers-drowned-after-hurricane-helene-wont-face-charges-2025-07-18/,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — The owner of a factory where six workers died last year in flooding from Hurricane Helene won't face charges after a Tennessee Bureau of Investigation found no criminal wrongdoing. First Judicial District Attorney General Steven Finney announced the decision to close the case on Friday, saying no further action will be taken. The investigation found no evidence that Impact Plastics employees were told they could not leave the factory or that they would be fired if they left, according to a news release from the district attorney. It also found employees had a little more than an hour during which they could have evacuated from the Erwin, Tennessee, industrial park. The conclusion mirrors that of a similar investigation by the Tennessee Occupational Safety and Health Administration that found in April that workers had time to evacuate the premises, albeit by makeshift routes. A statement from Impact Plastics attorney Stephen Ross Johnson on Friday said company president and founder Gerald O’Connor welcomes the results of the TBI investigation. “The true and accurate facts are now known,” the statement reads. Five employees and one contractor who cleaned the offices once a week were killed on Sept. 27 after they were washed away by floodwaters. They were among 12 people who stuck close to the Impact Plastics building, waiting for the water to recede, after realizing the exit road was already submerged. When the water kept rising, they climbed onto the bed of a semitrailer loaded with giant spools of plastic piping that was parked outside the factory. When floodwaters eventually overwhelmed the truck, six people were able to use the piping for flotation and were later rescued. The other six drowned. The TOSHA report notes that several Impact Plastics employees did escape the flood. Some were able to drive or walk over an embankment to a nearby highway after workers at a neighboring business dismantled a fence there. Others escaped by driving over a makeshift path onto nearby railroad tracks that an employee at a neighboring business created with a tractor. Still others were able to escape by walking to the railroad tracks, according to that report. Although the criminal case is being closed, the company still faces a wrongful death lawsuit from the family of Johnny Peterson, and other civil suits are planned. Attorney Luke Widener, who represents the families of several flood victims, said in a statement that they “categorically disagree that Impact Plastics employees were given any meaningful opportunity to escape. ...Indeed, if Impact Plastics’ account were true, Bertha Mendoza, Sibrina Barnett, and the others who perished would still be with us.""

Why Pure Storage Is a Core Investment for the AI Era,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/why-pure-storage-is-a-core-investment-for-the-ai-era/,"The global economy is undergoing a data-driven transformation. Artificial intelligence (AI) is the engine powering this shift, turning raw information into tangible business value. This AI engine has an insatiable appetite, requiring instant access to immense datasets to function effectively. While market attention often focuses on AI software and semiconductor chips, a critical and foundational industry makes this entire revolution possible. This critical industry is the world of high-performance data infrastructure. Pure Storage NYSE: PSTG operates at this essential layer, providing the high-speed data delivery systems that modern AI demands. For investors seeking to capitalize on the durable trend of data growth, Pure Storage’s pivotal role reveals a compelling opportunity. The central challenge in any large-scale AI initiative is the speed of data access. No matter how sophisticated, an AI model is useless if it is stuck waiting for data to arrive. Traditional storage systems, built on spinning disks, are simply too slow for this new reality. They create performance bottlenecks that can cripple multi-million-dollar AI investments. Pure Storage’s all-flash technology platform directly solves this problem. Its products are engineered for extremely low latency (fast response times) and high throughput (rapid data transfer), which are essential for AI. The company’s latest product launches from June 2025 demonstrate a clear and aggressive focus on this high-growth market. Pure Storage has solidified its credibility in this space through a deep partnership with NVIDIA NASDAQ: NVDA, the leader in AI computing. Pure Storage’s systems are certified and integrated into NVIDIA’s official AI data center blueprints. This serves as a powerful signal to enterprise customers and investors alike: Pure Storage is a validated, trusted partner at the heart of the AI ecosystem. This technological leadership is a primary driver for capturing market share and supporting future revenue growth. A critical component of the investment case for Pure Storage is its successful transformation from a hardware vendor into a modern platform company. This shift, centered on high-margin subscription services, fundamentally enhances its value proposition to investors. Instead of relying on cyclical, one-time hardware sales, Pure Storage has built its business around predictable, recurring revenue. Its Enterprise Data Cloud vision embodies this strategy, which unifies a customer's entire data storage infrastructure into a single, automated platform. This provides customers with a simplified, cloud-like experience while securing stable, long-term revenue for Pure Storage. Wall Street heavily favors this model due to the high degree of revenue visibility and strong customer loyalty it creates. The company’s first-quarter fiscal 2026 financial results prove this strategy is working: Reinforcing this strategic direction, Pure Storage recently appointed Tarek Robbiati as its new Chief Financial Officer. His experience includes leading a similar as-a-service business transformation at Hewlett-Packard Enterprise NYSE: HPE, a move that signals Pure Storage is adding proven leadership to accelerate its most lucrative strategy. An effective strategy must ultimately translate into strong financial performance, and Pure Storage is delivering on this promise. The company’s latest earnings report depicts a business executing with both growth and discipline. For the quarter, revenue grew 12% to $778.5 million. More importantly, the company is profitable and generates significant cash, reporting a free cash flow of $211.6 million. Its reaffirmed full-year guidance reflects management’s confidence, which projects 11% revenue growth and a healthy 17.0% non-GAAP operating margin. The professional analyst community has taken note of this consistent execution. The consensus rating from 20 Wall Street analysts covering the stock is a Moderate Buy. Their average 12-month price target is $69.95, representing a healthy potential upside from current trading levels. This combination of strong operational results and a positive outlook from market experts provides a solid foundation for continued stock appreciation. Pure Storage is not a speculative bet on a future technology; it is a profitable, established leader that provides the essential data infrastructure on which today's AI economy is built. Its superior technology, a proven and expanding subscription business model, and a strong track record of financial discipline create a compelling and strategic growth opportunity for investors.

Trump's attacks on Powell threaten the Fed's independence. Here's why it matters,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trumps-attacks-on-powell-threaten-the-feds-independence-heres-why-it-matters-2025-07-18/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has opened up a new front in his attack on the Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell: He says the alledged mismanagement of a building renovation project could be grounds for firing Powell. Such an unprecedented step could send the financial markets into a tailspin and over time push up interest rates and weaken the U.S. economy. If investors start to worry the Fed is no longer independent, fewer may buy U.S. bonds, which would push up the interest rate on those bonds and lift borrowing costs more broadly. Trump has criticized Powell for months because the chair has kept the short-term interest rate the Fed controls at 4.3% this year, after cutting it three times last year. Powell says the Fed wants to see how the economy responds to Trump's sweeping tariffs on imports, which Powell says could push up inflation. Powell's caution has infuriated Trump, who has demanded the Fed cut borrowing costs to spur the economy and reduce the interest rates the federal government pays on its debt. Firing the Fed chair would threaten the Fed’s venerated independence, which has long been supported by most economists and Wall Street investors. Here are some questions and answers about the Fed. The Fed has been renovating its Washington, D.C. headquarters and a neighboring building. With some of the construction occurring underground and as building materials have soared in price after inflation spiked in 2021 and 2022, the estimated cost has ballooned to about $2.5 billion, from $1.9 trillion. When asked if the costly rebuilding could be grounds to fire Powell, Trump said recently, “I think it is.” “When you spend $2.5 billion on, really, a renovation, I think it’s really disgraceful,” Trump said. Yet in 2020, The Associated Press has reported, several Trump appointees to a local review commission pushed the Fed to include more marble in the renovation. Yet now White House officials and other critics of the project are pointing to the marble as a sign of extravagance. The Fed wields extensive power over the U.S. economy. By cutting the short-term interest rate it controls — which it typically does when the economy falters — the Fed can make borrowing cheaper and encourage more spending, accelerating growth and hiring. When it raises the rate — which it does to cool the economy and combat inflation — it can weaken the economy and cause job losses. Economists have long preferred independent central banks because they can more easily take unpopular steps to fight inflation, such as raise interest rates, which makes borrowing to buy a home, car, or appliance more expensive. The importance of an independent Fed was cemented for most economists after the extended inflation spike of the 1970s and early 1980s. Former Fed Chair Arthur Burns has been widely blamed for allowing the painful inflation of that era to accelerate by succumbing to pressure from President Richard Nixon to keep rates low heading into the 1972 election. Nixon feared higher rates would cost him the election, which he won in a landslide. Paul Volcker was eventually appointed chair of the Fed in 1979 by President Jimmy Carter, and he pushed the Fed's short-term rate to the stunningly high level of nearly 20%. (It is currently 4.3%). The eye-popping rates triggered a sharp recession, pushed unemployment to nearly 11%, and spurred widespread protests. Yet Volcker didn't flinch. By the mid-1980s, inflation had fallen back into the low single digits. Volcker's willingness to inflict pain on the economy to throttle inflation is seen by most economists as a key example of the value of an independent Fed. An effort to fire Powell would almost certainly cause stock prices to fall and bond yields to spike higher, pushing up interest rates on government debt and raising borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, and credit card debt. The interest rate on the 10-year Treasury is a benchmark for mortgage rates. Most investors prefer an independent Fed, partly because it typically manages inflation better without being influenced by politics but also because its decisions are more predictable. Fed officials often publicly discuss how they would alter interest rate policies if economic conditions changed. If the Fed was more swayed by politics, it would be harder for financial markets to anticipate — or understand — its decisions. Well, no. Fed chairs like Powell are appointed by the president to serve four-year terms, and have to be confirmed by the Senate. The president also appoints the six other members of the Fed's governing board, who can serve staggered terms of up to 14 years. Those appointments can allow a president over time to significantly alter the Fed's policies. Former president Joe Biden appointed five of the current seven members: Powell, Lisa Cook, Philip Jefferson, Adriana Kugler, and Michael Barr. As a result, Trump will have fewer opportunities to make appointments. He will be able to replace Kugler, whose term ends Jan. 31, 2026. Congress, meanwhile, can set the Fed's goals through legislation. In 1977, for example, Congress gave the Fed a “dual mandate” to keep prices stable and seek maximum employment. The Fed defines stable prices as inflation at 2%. The 1977 law also requires the Fed chair to testify before the House and Senate twice every year about the economy and interest rate policy. The Supreme Court earlier this year suggested in a ruling on other independent agencies that a president can't fire the chair of the Fed just because he doesn't like the chair's policy choices. But he may be able to remove him “for cause,” typically interpreted to mean some kind of wrongdoing or negligence. It's a likely reason the Trump administration has zeroed in on the building renovation, in hopes it could provide a “for cause” pretext. Still, Powell would likely fight any attempt to remove him, and the case could wind up at the Supreme Court. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

2025: A Pivotal Year for Smart Glasses As Meta Invests in Ray-Ban,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/2025-a-pivotal-year-for-smart-glasses-as-meta-invests-in-ray-ban/,"Meta Platforms NASDAQ: META has built what is indisputably one of the world’s most successful businesses, but that doesn’t mean there haven’t been flops along the way. Meta’s most notable miscalculation was its full-blown “metaverse” push back in 2021. Founder Mark Zuckerberg envisioned a world where people would communicate in avatar-centric virtual environments, eventually replacing smartphones. This caused the company to change its name to Meta from Facebook in October 2021. From then until the end of 2022, Meta shares lost approximately 62% of their value. Fortunately for Zuck, shares have roared up by a whopping 500% since the end of 2022, as of July 14. Shifting from the metaverse toward AI-enabled advertising was exactly what Meta needed. Still, the metaverse lives on through Meta’s Reality Labs segment, which Zuckerberg still sees as key to the company’s future. Evidencing this is the nearly 3% stake Meta has reportedly bought in EssilorLuxottica OTCMKTS: ESLOY, the maker of Ray-Ban and Oakley glasses. Meta makes smart glasses in collaboration with these two brands. So, what does this say about the future of Reality Labs, and can it become a positive contributor to the overall company? It is important to realize that Meta has succeeded over the past several years in spite of Reality Labs, not because of it. Over the last nine quarters, Reality Labs generated less than $4.5 billion in revenue and had an operating loss of approximately $38 billion. Meta’s investment in EssilorLuxottica doesn’t change this. But, it does signal how deep both firms' commitment to smart glasses is. Meta may now be one of the larger shareholders in EssilorLuxottica, especially as its stake could grow to 5%. This could give it some ability to influence EssilorLuxottica’s operations going forward. Given the two firms' long-standing collaboration on smart glasses, it is likely that EssilorLuxottica was aware of, or at least not opposed to, Meta’s investment. This signals that EssilorLuxottica is confident in the long-term future of smart glasses. They likely wouldn’t want Meta as a big shareholder if the two did not truly share a long-term strategic vision. At the same time, Meta is doubling down on Reality Labs. It is betting that EssilorLuxottica’s shares will rise based on the adoption of the tech that the two build together. The investment also signals that Meta is shifting its focus more toward smart glasses, as opposed to VR headsets. This is a good sign for the future of Reality Labs. For Reality Labs to become profitable, sales need to rise massively. The Vision Council estimates that around 85% of Americans wear non-prescription sunglasses. Thus, targeting this market is much more likely to bring the scale that Reality Labs needs as opposed to VR headsets. Additionally, smart glasses are for everyday use, while VR headsets cater to gaming and entertainment. This provides greater opportunities for the company to build other revenue streams, such as advertising or subscriptions, into the smart glasses. In 2024, Meta reportedly sold one million of its Ray-Ban smart glasses. Zuckerberg aims to increase this number to between two million and five million by 2025. However, in Q1, Reality Labs sales fell around 6% from the prior year quarter, putting the company solidly behind the eight ball when it comes to reaching this goal. Meta released its Oakley smart glasses in July and is planning another release with Prada. It's possible that these releases could help the overall segment, as Meta specifically targets athletic and luxury-oriented consumers. Meta’s returns over the past several years show that it hasn’t needed Reality Labs to be successful for the stock to appreciate. Given this, some might assume that Meta is playing with house money; any improvement in this part of the business will be beneficial to shares. However, a huge new competitor is rising up. Google parent company Alphabet NASDAQ: GOOG is partnering with Samsung Electronics OTCMKTS: SSNLF and Warby Parker NYSE: WRBY to release its own smart glasses in 2026. If their offering really takes off, Meta shares could get whacked. Thus, seeing strong sales growth in Meta’s smart glasses becomes ever more important in 2025. Reality Labs will almost certainly not achieve profitability anytime soon. However, building on its lead in smart glasses could add upside to shares. At the same time, failing to do so could prove costly. Before you consider EssilorLuxottica, you'll want to hear this.

Unity’s New Ad Solutions Drive Stock to 52-Week High,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/unitys-new-ad-solutions-drive-stock-to-52-week-high/,"Unity Software NYSE: U gave investors a reason to take notice in mid-July 2025. The company’s stock jumped over 14% to a new 52-week high. Unity’s stock price jump was powered by a trading volume of nearly 40 million shares, more than three times its daily average. The immediate trigger was a positive report from an analyst at Jefferies, who raised the stock's price target to $35 and held a firm Buy rating. The market’s positive reaction suggests a significant shift in investors' perception of the company. For months, the story surrounding Unity focused on a complex turnaround. Now, that story is changing, with a new focus on clear evidence that the company's strategy is working under its new leadership. The key question for investors is precisely what drives this powerful new wave of analyst optimism. The main reason for the renewed confidence is the accelerating momentum within Unity’s Grow Solutions segment. This division helps game developers attract new players and make money from their creations. It is the heart of Unity's turnaround story, and two recent developments show why analysts are taking notice. The first is the impressive performance of Unity Vector, the company’s new AI-powered advertising platform. In its first-quarter report, Unity revealed that Vector is already delivering a significant 15-20% performance lift for its advertisers. For investors, this is a critical update. In digital advertising, results are everything. When a platform delivers a higher return on ad spend, advertisers are motivated to increase their spending on it. This creates a positive cycle that drives high-margin revenue, a key part of Unity’s plan for long-term profitability. Unity is also thinking beyond its current success. In June 2025, the company launched the Unity Audience Hub, a new platform for creating highly targeted ad campaigns. This initiative is backed by major partners, including data firm Experian OTCMKTS: EXPGY and streaming giant Roku NASDAQ: ROKU. The Roku partnership is especially important. It enables Unity to sell ads on Connected TV (CTV) platforms, a large and growing part of the entertainment sector that currently lies outside Unity's traditional mobile gaming space. This strategic move signals a sophisticated plan to improve Unity's existing ad business and capture new sources of revenue. The exciting developments in Unity’s ad business are made more compelling by the stability and discipline seen across the entire company. The market is buying into the growth story now because it is built on a much stronger financial and operational foundation. A key part of this foundation is the health of Unity’s core Create Solutions business. The successful launch of the Unity 6 engine has helped rebuild trust with software developers after a controversial pricing change in 2023. This restored confidence is showing up in the company's financials. Revenue from high-margin subscriptions in this segment grew at a double-digit rate in the first quarter, providing a predictable and profitable base for the company. At the same time, the company's strategic portfolio reset, Unity’s plan to focus only on its most promising products, is showing clear results. The company’s first-quarter financial report highlighted several key improvements: These numbers provide tangible evidence that the company's focus on disciplined execution is paying off, lending credibility to its optimistic outlook. Unity’s recent stock rally represents a decisive vote of confidence from the market. The combination of a revitalized advertising business, a stable core engine, and proven financial discipline is painting a compelling picture of a company on the right track. While Unity is still completing its strategic shift away from less profitable business lines, the improvements seen today are setting the stage for an expected return to top-line revenue growth in the second half of 2025. As the benefits from Unity Vector and new partnerships build, the company's focus will likely continue to shift from recovery to expansion. The next major checkpoint for investors will be the second-quarter earnings report, expected in mid-August. This report will first test whether the company’s strong operational momentum can translate into accelerating financial performance. For Unity, the story is clearly shifting from a challenging turnaround to one of focused execution and credible, long-term growth potential.

Coldplay's jumbotron captures — what exactly? The internet has its theories,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/coldplays-jumbotron-captures--what-exactly-the-internet-has-its-theories-2025-07-18/,"LONDON (AP) — It started out as a routine bit of fun at a Coldplay concert: Lead singer Chris Martin asked the cameras to scan the crowd for his “Jumbotron Song,” when he sings a few lines about the people the camera lands on. At a concert at Gillette Stadium in Massachusetts on Wednesday, a man wearing a birthday sash was up first. Two people in banana costumes were highlighted. But in between, something else ensued. For several seconds, a couple was shown on the big screen. They were cuddling and smiling, his arms wrapped around her, as she leaned back into him. When they saw themselves on the big screen, her jaw dropped, her hands flew to her face and she spun away from the camera. He ducked out of the frame, as did she. “Either they’re having an affair or they’re just very shy,” Martin joked. But it didn't end there. The video went viral, and the internet got to work. The Associated Press could not immediately confirm the couple's identity. But internet sleuths allege he is the chief executive officer of a U.S.-based company, while she is the chief people officer — in other words, the head of human resources. A spokesman for the company did not respond when asked to confirm the identities of the people shown on camera. But he said in an email that a statement circulating online that was attributed to the chief executive was a “fake from a clearly labeled parody account.” The company later released a statement saying it had opened an investigation into the incident, but did not directly identify the employees. The woman didn’t respond to a request for comment on LinkedIn. The man's LinkedIn page appeared to be deactivated, and no other way of contacting him could be immediately found. A phone call to a number listed in an online directory under his name went straight to voicemail. Attempts to reach him through other numbers associated with his name in the directory were not successful. A representative for Coldplay said the band had no comment. It’s easy to miss, but most concert venues have signs informing the audience that they could be filmed during the event. Look for them on the walls when you arrive and around the bar areas or toilets. It’s common practice especially when bands like to use performances for music videos or concert films. The venue in this case, Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, also has a privacy policy online which states: “When you visit our location or attend or participate in an event at our location, we may capture your image, voice and/or likeness, including through the use of CCTV cameras and/or when we film or photograph you in a public location.” In the internet age, such videos — or ones taken on someone's smartphone — can quickly zip around the world. This video rocketed around social media, as people speculated about why the couple dodged the camera. Empathy for the pair and their families was mixed with plenty of snarky commentary and countless memes, with the fake statement from the chief executive generating a lot of additional vitriol. And news reports said that the CEO's LinkedIn account was disabled after it was flooded by a wave of comments. “It’s a little bit unsettling how easily we can be identified with biometrics, how our faces are online, how social media can track us — and how the internet has gone from being a place of interaction, to a gigantic surveillance system,"" said Mary Angela Bock, an associate professor in the University of Texas at Austin’s School of Journalism and Media. ""We are being surveilled by our social media. They’re tracking us in exchange for entertaining us.” _____ AP Business Writer Wyatte Grantham-Philips contributed to this report from New York.

'Women deserve to be at the table': The WNBA's signature shoe boom,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/women-deserve-to-be-at-the-table-the-wnbas-signature-shoe-boom-2025-07-18/,"INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Signature shoes are ready for their share of the Indianapolis spotlight at All-Star weekend. Bright orange All-Star editions of Sabrina Ionescu’s and A’ja Wilson’s newest sneakers dropped into their eager fans’ hands Thursday morning, joining the now legions of WNBA signature shoes on courts across the league. It’s the latest installation in a busy boom for WNBA signature sneakers. In the past three years, Breanna Stewart, Ionescu, and Wilson have all released signature shoes, with Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese signatures in the works. “We knew there would be an adoption, but we didn’t know it would be that fast and that grand,” Ben Nethongkome, the lead designer for Ionescu’s shoe with Nike, said of the growth of her line. “It’s been highly rewarding to see Nike really addressing the ask and need from that side of the game,” he added. “It’s great to hear the (male signature athletes) giving flowers, like, ‘Wow, women’s basketball is really growing in a beautiful way.’” StockX, a prominent force in the sneaker resale ecosystem, has been feeling the surge within sneakerhead culture. Sales of WNBA signature sneakers on their site jumped 938% from 2023 to 2024, and they are on pace to see year-over-year sales of them increase by double digits again this year. Brendan Dunne, senior director of customer community and engagement at StockX, called it “an explosion of interest.” But don’t mistake it as a new phenomenon. Call it a comeback. From 1995 to 2010, nine WNBA signature sneakers hit the shelves, led by original stars Sheryl Swoopes and Lisa Leslie. In the next 12 years, there was only one, from Elena Delle Donne. New York Liberty stars All-Stars Stewart and Ionescu were the first two active WNBA players to sign their new deals, with Puma and Nike, respectively, to end the drought and usher in this new era. The most recent Sabrinas and A'Ones, both with Nike, retail at $135 and $115, respectively. The most recent Stewies with Puma retail at $120. “When I was able to get mine, I understood the gravity of knowing it’s going to be a successful business, and showing the world that women deserve to be at the table talking about the signature shoe business,” Ionescu said. “They really can change the landscape of the sport.” Wilson's first model was released in May. “It’s been a dream come true,” the WNBA MVP said. “To see everybody in the community wear it, it warms my heart and it never gets old. I’m like, you really took the time to support me.” The Angel Reese 1s are the next drop on the signature shoe calendar, and the shoe's image and “Diamond Dust” colorway were revealed to the public earlier this month. The shoe will be officially launching in 2026. “I’m happy for that,” said basketball Hall of Famer Shaquille O’Neal, who has been a mentor for Reese. “She’s having fun. She represents our family.” “(The WNBA) is big, but it needs to become bigger,” he said. Nethongkome said that in comparison to the design style in the 1990s, which was more “bold and kind of in your face,” many sneakers in their new lines feature more hidden nods, like the slight vertical tip of the Nike logo on Ionescu’s shoe to represent the breaking of a glass ceiling or the lowercase ‘i’ on the heel. Those small design choices are representative of a larger trend in today’s new signatures. Personal details and storylines are becoming more prevalent, making each shoe especially distinctive to its athlete. Ionescu’s sneakers feature gradient embroidery that pay homage to her Romanian roots, and Wilson’s original A’One colorway was pearlescent, as a nod to a pearl necklace her late grandmother gave her. A favorite saying from her grandmother is featured on the outsole: “As a matter of fact, the best is yet to come.” ___ The Associated Press’ women in the workforce and state government coverage receives financial support from Pivotal Ventures.

Fashion startup founder charged with $300M fraud freed on $1M bail,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/fashion-startup-founder-charged-with-300-million-fraud-2025-07-18/,"NEW YORK (AP) — A former chief executive of two clothing technology companies was released on $1 million bail Friday after pleading not guilty to charges alleging she cheated investors of over $300 million over the past six years. Christine Hunsicker, 48, of Lafayette, New Jersey, was charged with six counts, including fraud, aggravated identity theft and false statement charges in the indictment in Manhattan federal court. U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton said in a release that Hunsicker forged documents, fabricated audits and made material misrepresentations about her company's financial condition to defraud investors in CaaStle Inc. and P180. The indictment said Hunsicker, once portrayed as an on-the-rise fashion entrepreneur, portrayed CaaStle as a high-growth, private company with substantial cash on hand when she knew it faced significant financial distress. In a statement, defense lawyers Michael Levy and Anna Skotko said prosecutors “have chosen to present to the public an incomplete and very distorted picture in today's indictment,” despite Hunsicker's efforts to be “fully cooperative and transparent” with prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange Commission. “There is much more to this story, and we look forward to telling it,” they said. Hunsicker did not comment as she left the courthouse with Skotko after entering the not-guilty plea and agreeing to the rules of her $1 million bail, which included not having any contact with former or current investors or employees. According to the indictment, Hunsicker continued her fraudulent scheme even after the CaaStle board of directors removed her and prohibited her from soliciting investments or taking other actions on the company's behalf. She “persisted in her scheme” even after law enforcement agents confronted her over the fraud, the indictment said. Before the fraud allegations emerged, Hunsicker seemed to be a rising star in the fashion world after she was named to Crain's New York Business “40 under 40” lists, was selected as one of Inc.'s “Most Impressive Women Entrepreneurs” and was recognized by the National Retail Federation as someone shaping the future of retail, the indictment noted. At a time when the business was in financial distress with limited cash available and significant expenses, CaaStle was valued by Hunsicker at $1.4 billion, the indictment said. Hunsicker was lying to investors in February 2019 and continued to do so through this March, prosecutors alleged. They said she fed investors falsely inflated income statements, fake audited financial statements, fictitious bank account records and sham corporate records. She allegedly told one investor in August 2023 that CaaStle reported an operating profit of nearly $24 million in the second quarter of 2023 when its operating profit that quarter was actually less than $30,000. The indictment alleged that she carried out the majority of the fraud by bilking CaaStle investors of $275 million before forming P180 last year to infuse CaaStle with cash before its investors could discover her fraud. Through misrepresentations and omissions, she cheated P180 investors out of about $30 million, the indictment said. It said CaaStle filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy last month, leaving hundreds of investors holding now-worthless CaaStle shares. Hunsicker was forced to resign from CaaStle's board in December and formally resigned as chief executive in March. In a related civil filing, the SEC said Hunsicker's “fake financials” supported her narrative that CaaStle was nearing an initial public offering or sale in late 2022 as it enjoyed rapid and steady revenue growth after launching a new monetization model called “Clothing-as-a-Service.” “In reality, CaaStle's revenues were shrinking, its losses were increasing, and the company was never profitable,” the lawsuit said. “Not a single existing or prospective CaaStle investor received accurate monthly, quarterly, or annual CaaStle financial statements from Hunsicker.” Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

Education Department will release some frozen grants supporting after-school and summer programs,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/education-department-will-release-some-frozen-grants-supporting-after-school-and-summer-programs-2025-07-18/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Education Department will release $1.3 billion in previously withheld grant money for after-school programs, days after 10 Republican senators sent a letter imploring the Trump administration to allow frozen education money to be sent to states. President Donald Trump’s administration on July 1 withheld more than $6 billion in federal grants for after-school and summer programs, adult literacy and English language instruction, part of a review to ensure spending aligned with the White House’s priorities. In a letter sent Wednesday, Republican senators said the withheld money supported programs that had longstanding bipartisan support and were critical to local communities. The money had been appropriated by Congress in a bill that was signed by Trump. “We share your concern about taxpayer money going to fund radical left-wing programs,” the senators wrote to the Office of Management and Budget. “However, we do not believe that is happening with these funds.” The administration's review of the 21st Century Community Learning Centers, which support after-school and summer programming, has been completed, a senior official said Friday. The person declined to be identified so they could share progress from the review. That funding will be released to states, the official said. The rest of the withheld grants, close to $5 billion, continues to be reviewed for bias by the Office of Management and Budget. Without the money, school districts and nonprofits such as the YMCA and Boys and Girls Club of America had said they would have to close or scale back educational offerings this fall. The money being released Friday pays for free programming before and after school and during the summer. The programs provide child care so low-income parents can work, and they give options to families who live in rural areas with few other child care providers. Beyond just child care, kids receive reading and math help at the programs, along with enrichment in science and the arts. Despite the money's release Friday, schools and nonprofits have already been disrupted by two weeks of uncertainty. Some programs have made plans to close, and others have fallen behind on hiring and contracting for the fall. “While we are thrilled the funds will be made available,"" said Jodi Grant, executive director of the Afterschool Alliance, “the administration’s inexplicable delay in disbursing them caused massive chaos and harm."" Many after-school programs had canceled plans to open in the fall, she said. On Monday, more than 20 states had filed a lawsuit challenging the $6 billion funding freeze, including the money for English language instruction, teacher development and adult literacy that remains on hold. The lawsuit, led by California, argued withholding the money was unconstitutional and many low-income families would lose access to critical after-school care if the grants were not released. David Schuler, executive director of AASA, an association of school superintendents, praised the release of after-school money but said that the remaining education funding should not be withheld. “Districts should not be in this impossible position where the Administration is denying funds that had already been appropriated to our public schools, by Congress,” Schuler said in a statement. “The remaining funds must be released immediately — America’s children are counting on it.” Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-West Virginia, who chairs the Senate Appropriations subcommittee that oversees education spending, led the letter sent this week by Republican senators, protesting the funding freeze. The letter called for the rest of the money to be released, including funds for adult education and teaching English as a second language. “The decision to withhold this funding is contrary to President Trump’s goal of returning K-12 education to the states,” the senators wrote. “This funding goes directly to states and local school districts, where local leaders decide how this funding is spent.” Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, called on the White House to release the rest of the money. “At this very moment, schools nationwide are crunching the numbers to figure out how many teachers they will need to lay off as Trump continues to hold up billions in funding,” Murray said Friday in a statement. “Every penny of this funding must flow immediately.” ____ The Associated Press’ education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Why Abbott Laboratories Is a Q2 2025 Buy: Growth & Yield,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/why-abbott-laboratories-is-a-q2-2025-buy-growth-and-yield/,"If you wonder whether Abbott Laboratories NYSE: ABT is a good buy in Q2 2025, the answer is yes. The company’s management, portfolio, cash flow, capital return, and pipeline are why. The stock price came under pressure in July because the Q3 guidance update wasn’t better than what the market expected. Sound crazy, but it's true: the robust outlook wasn’t enough to keep speculators interested, but it isn’t the speculators that matter in the long term. What matters in the long term is that the company’s growth trajectory is positive, supporting a robust capital outlook that includes dividends and share repurchases. The combination of business growth, dividend distribution growth, and share repurchases serves as a lever for shareholder value that will propel the stock price to new highs.  And the capital return is significant. The dividend is worth approximately 1.8% as of mid-July, is less than 50% of the earnings outlook, and has grown at a robust 10% CAGR over the past few years. Those are robust metrics for a Dividend Aristocrat, especially for a Dividend King like Abbott, which has increased its payout for over 50 years. That is a testament to management's foresight and execution, qualities that will continue to benefit investors in the long term. Abbott’s share repurchases are also significant, as they reduce the share count quarterly. The company reduced its share count incrementally in the first half of the year and is expected to continue reducing it through the end of the year. Abbott Laboratories had a solid quarter, with revenue growth topping 7.4%, reported, about 70 basis points better than expected, driven by strength in all regions and reporting segments. Organically, growth was reported at 6.9% and 7.5% excluding COVID-19 testing supplies. Regionally, the U.S. was strongest at 8.7%, but the International Market was also solid at 6.6%. Segmentally, Diagnostics was the only weak point but was impacted by COVID, declining on a reported basis but rising incrementally organically. Other segments grew by at least 3%, led by a strong, industry-leading 12% gain in Medical Devices. The margin news is also good. Revenue leverage and operational quality offset macroeconomic pressures, resulting in a 100-basis-point improvement in adjusted gross and operating margins. The net result is $1.26 in adjusted earnings, only as expected, but up a leveraged 10.5% compared to the slower 7.4% top-line growth. The critical takeaway is that the cash flow is sufficient to sustain the capital return outlook, balance sheet health, and pipeline advancement, which support the stock price action over time. Regarding the pipeline, the company reported advancement of several key studies and one major approval for the quarter. Guidance is the sticking point for market action in July. The company narrowed its revenue growth range, indicating solid growth of 7.5% to 8%, with earnings in line with the consensus figure. However, a stronger catalyst was needed to lift the share prices. Investors should focus on growth, earnings, cash flow, and the pipeline, which promises to sustain them all. The analysts' trends are supportive of Abbott’s stock price. The group issued a steady string of upgrades and price target revisions up to the day of the release, resulting in increasing coverage, firming sentiment, and a rising consensus price target. The group has the stock pegged at Moderate Buy with a bullish bias, forecasting a 10% increase relative to the pre-release closing price.

"Trump signs new stablecoin regulations into law, a major milestone for crypto industry",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-signs-new-stablecoin-regulations-into-law-a-major-milestone-for-crypto-industry-2025-07-18/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Friday signed into law new regulations for a type of cryptocurrency, a major milestone for an industry that has spent heavily to strengthen its legitimacy and political might. The GENIUS Act sets initial guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins, which are tied to assets like the U.S. dollar to reduce price volatility compared with other forms of cryptocurrency. It passed both the House and Senate with wide bipartisan margins. The new law is meant to bolster consumer confidence in the crypto industry, which has quickly become a major power player in Washington thanks to massive campaign donations and spending on lobbying. Its passage comes as Trump had repeatedly pledged to make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the world.” “For years you were mocked and dismissed and counted out,"" Trump told crypto industry executives at a White House bill signing attended by about 200 people, including several top GOP lawmakers. “This signing is a massive validation of your hard work and your pioneering spirit.” The crypto industry has long complained it was unfairly targeted by former President Joe Biden's administration and spent heavily to help Trump win last year's election. The president lavished praise on crypto leaders during his speech Friday, saying “nobody has gained the respect in such a short period of time.” Trump said helping the cryptocurrency industry was “good for the dollar and it’s good for the country.” “That’s why I backed you at an early stage,” said Trump, who had previously been a skeptic of cryptocurrency before embracing it. His administration has taken several early steps to boost the crypto industry, including the Securities and Exchange Commission dropping several enforcement actions against large crypto companies. Trump then added a candid admission about the political calculus of his support for the crypto industry: “And I also did it for the votes,” he said, drawing laughter from the audience. The president also joked that lawmakers had named the GENIUS Act after him. The acronym stands for “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins.” The use of stablecoins has grown dramatically in recent years. Circle, the U.S.-based issuer of one of the most popular cryptocurrencies, made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange earlier this year and quickly saw its value soar amid heavy interest from crypto enthusiasts and investors. Stablecoin issuers make profits by collecting the interest on the assets they hold in reserve to back their stablecoins. A provision in the GENIUS Act bans members of Congress and their families from profiting off stablecoins. But that prohibition does not extend to the president and his family, even as Trump builds a crypto empire from the White House. His family holds a significant stake in World Liberty Financial, a crypto project that launched its own stablecoin earlier this year and received an early boost from an investment fund in the United Arab Emirates. The House also passed two other bills Thursday that are meant to help the crypto industry. One creates a new market structure for cryptocurrency, and the other bans the Federal Reserve from issuing a new digital currency. Both measures now go to the Senate.

"Judge restores Democrat to Federal Trade Commission, ruling her firing by Trump was illegal",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/judge-restores-democrat-to-federal-trade-commission-ruling-her-firing-by-trump-was-illegal-2025-07-18/,"A federal judge has restored a Democrat to the Federal Trade Commission, ruling that President Donald Trump illegally fired her earlier this year in his efforts to exert control over independent agencies across the government. U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan ruled late Thursday that federal law protects FTC commissioners from being removed by the president without cause, citing a key 1935 U.S. Supreme Court decision involving the FTC. The decision allows Rebecca Kelly Slaughter to resume her duties as commissioner. The FTC website had been updated by Friday morning to show that Slaughter is among four sitting commissioners. Attorneys for the Trump administration almost immediately declared their intent to appeal, and the case could make its way to the Supreme Court. The conservative-led court already has narrowed the reach of the 90-year-old decision, known as Humphrey’s Executor, and some justices have called for overturning it altogether. The high court also permitted Trump to fire the heads of other independent agencies. In May, the court allowed Trump to remove members of the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board, despite lower court rulings that Humphrey’s Executor should protect them from arbitrary dismissal. The justices are currently weighing an emergency appeal from the administration to oust three Democratic members of the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Trump fired them in May, but a federal judge restored them to their positions a month later. The legal fight over the firings also could extend to the Federal Reserve and the prospect of Trump firing Fed chairman Jerome Powell. The justices suggested in May that Trump may not have the same freedom to upend the leadership of the Fed, describing it as “a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity.” In her opinion, AliKhan said she was required to abide by the Humphrey’s Executor decision, in which the court rebuffed President Franklin Roosevelt and held that FTC commissioners could be removed only for cause, not at the president’s whim. She said her ruling would uphold “clearly established law that has been enacted by a coequal branch of government, reaffirmed by another coequal branch, and acquiesced to by thirteen executives over the course of ninety years.” But the judge acknowledged that hers probably would not be the last word. “Defendants are, of course, free to take their quarrels with Humphrey’s Executor to the Supreme Court. This court has no illusions about where this case’s journey leads,” she wrote. Trump fired Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya, the commission’s two Democratic members in March. The FTC is a regulator created by Congress that enforces consumer protection measures and antitrust legislation. Its seats typically include three members of the president’s party and two from the opposing party. The commissioners sued to reclaim their jobs, saying they’d been dismissed illegally. Slaughter has four years left in her term as commissioner. Bedoya submitted his resignation in June, and AliKhan dismissed his claim as a result. “As the Court recognized today, the law is clear, and I look forward to getting back to work,” Slaughter said in a statement Thursday. During a May court hearing in federal court in Washington, D.C., plaintiffs’ attorneys warned against granting the president “absolute removal power over any executive officer,” saying it would effectively eliminate an important check on his power. “That has never been the case in this country,” said attorney Aaron Crowell. “That’s not the law. That has never been the law.” A politicized FTC also could favor powerful corporations while driving up prices for consumers, the lawyers for the fired commissioners said. But attorneys for the Trump administration argued that the FTC’s role has expanded since the 1930s, and as such, its members should answer directly to the president. “The president should be able to remove someone who is actively blocking his policies, for example,” Justice Department lawyer Emily Hall said during the hearing. AliKhan, who was nominated to the federal bench by President Joe Biden in 2023, noted the long line of presidents before Trump who didn’t try to push the limits. Commissioners are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. They serve seven-year terms that are staggered to prevent multiple vacancies at once. They can be fired for displaying specific bad behaviors, including inefficiency, neglect of duty and malfeasance in office. Trump told Bedoya and Slaughter that he was dismissing them because their service on the commission was inconsistent with his administration’s priorities, according to the lawsuit.

Trump’s pivot from aid to trade leaves Africa wary as it faces tariffs and uncertainty,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trumps-pivot-from-aid-to-trade-leaves-africa-wary-as-it-faces-tariffs-and-uncertainty-2025-07-18/,"HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) — When U.S. President Donald Trump met five African leaders in Washington this month, his lack of familiarity with the continent was on display. He praised Liberian President Joseph Boakai’s English — Liberia’s official language — and gestured at another leader to wrap up remarks. But the bigger takeaway was Trump’s pledge to transform U.S.-Africa relations: a shift from aid to trade, even as the region reels from his steep tariffs and sweeping aid cuts. African leaders offered minerals from manganese to uranium and possibly lithium. Senegal’s president even sought to leverage Trump’s love of golf by inviting him to build a course. Yet many nations are anxious about Washington’s new path. Here's a look at Trump's new ‘trade not aid’ policy toward African nations: After slashing billions in foreign aid, including shutting down the U.S. Agency for International Development — which provided over $12 billion in humanitarian assistance in 2024 alone — the Trump administration says it is forging a new approach: “commercial diplomacy.” Trade, not aid, is the order of the day. “It is now truly our policy for Africa,” said Troy Fitrell, the top U.S. diplomat for Africa, when announcing the strategy in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, in May. Ambassadors will now be judged not by aid projects but on “how well they support” local businesses and “how effectively they advocate for U.S. business and the number of deals they facilitate,” he said. Africa accounts for less than 1% of U.S. goods trade, but Fitrell called it “the world’s largest untapped market,” projecting its purchasing power could surpass $16 trillion by 2050. Washington touts quick progress: 33 agreements worth $6 billion in Trump’s first 100 days, plus $2.5 billion in commitments at a U.S.-Africa business summit in June. Projects span grain storage and digital infrastructure in Angola, energy ventures in Rwanda, Sierra Leone and Congo, and tourism in Ethiopia. Still, many worry about the costs. Job losses and economic pain from tariffs are mounting even as Washington celebrates these wins. Trump did not invent the idea of trade over aid. African leaders have pushed for this since the 1970s. The problem, critics say, is the caveat of tariffs and uncertainty over the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), the U.S. flagship program for trade with the continent. “In reality, these tariffs are not about trade balances. It’s economic warfare,” said the Alternative Information and Development Centre, a South African NGO. Trump has imposed a 30% tariff on selected South African goods and threatens another 10% for nations aligned with the BRICS bloc of developing economies. South Africa’s Automotive Business Council says vehicle exports to the U.S. have plunged over 80%, warning that tariffs “strike at the heart of South Africa’s industrialization agenda.” More than 100,000 jobs, mostly in auto and agriculture, are at risk, the council says. Smaller nations are also reeling. Lesotho declared a state of disaster after being hit with 50% duties — the second-highest rate after China — before Trump announced a 90-day pause. About 12,000 textile jobs in Lesotho hang in the balance, according to its Minister of Trade, Industry, and Business Development, Mokhethi Shelile. From vanilla farmers in Madagascar to cocoa growers in Ivory Coast and oil exporters in Nigeria, tariffs have shaken economies and raised doubts about Washington’s intent. “The U.S. certainly can’t have it both ways,” said Brendon Verster, an economist at Oxford Economics Africa. “The ‘aid to trade’ stance risks leaving Africa behind once the U.S. has gotten what it wanted, which will probably be critical minerals."" AGOA, enacted in 2000 and renewed in 2015, allows duty-free U.S. access for nearly 2,000 goods from 32 African nations. It expires in September, with no clear sign that it will be renewed. South Africa’s trade minister warned it will be “very difficult” to keep AGOA under current conditions. Fitrell said he is a “big fan” of the deal but told African leaders they must do more to lobby Congress. Future arrangements may require “much greater attention toward some form of reciprocity” to reflect Trump’s push for U.S. economic interests, he said. Meanwhile, China is leveraging zero-tariff policies to expand its influence. In June, China — already Africa’s biggest trading partner — said it plans to grant duty-free market access to 53 African nations. Still, Verster said some African nations might be cautious about strengthening ties with China, for fear of triggering retaliation from the U.S. “Aligning with China … could possibly bring about more economic punishment from the U.S.,"" he said. ___ This story has been corrected to show that the U.S. Agency for International Development provided over $12 billion in humanitarian assistance in 2024, not 2025.

Trump appointees pushed more marble in Fed building renovation White House now attacks,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-appointees-pushed-more-marble-in-fed-building-renovation-white-house-now-attacks-2025-07-18/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has looked to the marble finishes and hefty price tag of the Federal Reserve headquarters to claim grounds to fire Chair Jerome Powell, with whom he has tussled for years over interest rates. But the extensive use of marble in the building is, at least in part, the result of policies backed by Trump himself. As the Fed moved forward with plans to renovate its Great Depression-era headquarters in Washington during Trump's first term, it faced concerns in 2020 during a vetting process involving Trump appointees, who called for more “white Georgia marble” for the facade of the building. The Fed's architects said the central bank wanted glass walls, to reflect the Fed as a transparent institution, but three Trump appointees to a local commission felt marble best fit the building's historic character. While most of the proposed glass exterior was kept, some marble was added as a result, according to the minutes of the Commission of Fine Arts, which advises the federal government on architecture. The marble does not explain the roughly $600 million in cost overruns for the project, now budgeted to cost $2.5 billion, which also includes the addition of an underground parking garage and new glass atria in the building's courtyards. But the roots of its extensive use further muddies the White House's attempts to use the renovation to paint the central banker as a profligate spender as a possible pretext to removing him. “I wouldn’t be surprised if the result costs more” because of the added marble, said Alex Krieger, a Harvard University emeritus professor who was a member of the commission and participated in hearings on the Fed’s proposal. Russ Vought, Trump's top budget adviser, cited “premium marble” in a letter to Powell last week as an example of the “ostentatious overhaul.” In a response late Thursday, Powell wrote that the project would “use new domestic marble"" for several reasons, including ""to address concerns raised by external review agencies."" The National Capital Planning Commission, which also reviewed and approved the Fed renovation project, has started an inquiry into how Powell oversaw the updates. “The Federal Reserve’s extravagant multi-billion dollar renovation happened on the watch of the Fed’s leadership, and the Fed’s leadership needs to own up for this mismanagement of taxpayer dollars – as well as its botched coverup job,” said White House spokesman Kush Desai. A Fed spokesperson declined to comment. There is an uncomfortable possibility that the fate of the U.S. central bank and its foundational role in the economy hinges on a dispute about renovation costs and architecture, one that could lead a broader legal battle as to whether Trump can dismiss a Fed chair he dislikes after the Supreme Court in May described the institution as having protections against an abrupt firing. Trump, who has redecorated the Oval Office in gold leaf, has argued that inflation is not a concern, so the Fed can dramatically slash its rate to encourage more borrowing. But Powell and other Fed committee members are waiting to see whether Trump’s tariffs lift inflation, which higher interest rates could help blunt. The Fed chair pushed back against criticism during a June congressional hearing that the renovation was lavish by saying some features were removed due to cost, leading the White House to speculate as to whether Powell deceived lawmakers or made changes to the renovation plans without getting additional approvals. At that hearing, Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., also cited “white marble” as an example of extravagance. James Blair, a White House deputy chief of staff who was recently added to the planning commission, said Wednesday that he would send a letter to the Fed requesting any revisions to the project. His goal is to see whether Powell was accurate in his congressional testimony. “He’s either telling the truth or he isn’t,” Blair told The Associated Press. “If he’s telling the truth, he can prove it by just submitting all the plans and revisions.” Blair told reporters Friday that the Fed offered to let them inspect the construction site at 7 p.m. that evening, but the timing didn't work and officials would like to tour the area next week. Trump said Wednesday that he’s “highly unlikely” to try to fire Powell unless there was what he deemed as “fraud.” The attempt to remove Powell before his May 2026 term as chair ends could unleash a devastating financial blowback, as financial markets expect the Fed, with its mission of stabilizing prices and maximizing employment, to be free of White House politicking. The perception that the central bank would use its powers to serve Trump’s political ends could lead to higher interest rates on the U.S. debt and mortgages, instead of the declines being promised by the president. The 115-year old Commission of Fine Arts reviewed the plans for the renovation three times in 2020. Duncan Stroik, who was appointed to the commission in 2019 during Trump’s first term, “proposed an amendment requesting that the next submission include an alternative design in white Georgia marble, the same material used for the five existing buildings along the north side of Constitution Avenue,” the minutes of a Jan. 16, 2020, meeting said. Stroik “does not think the proposed additions defer to the historic buildings as great marble edifices on an important street,” the minutes added. Stroik’s amendment was voted down, but the commission didn’t fully endorse the Fed’s plans. The architects presented new plans in May 2020, though those didn’t appear to satisfy Trump’s appointees. Some commissioners “continued to object to the addition as a glass box that is reminiscent of a commercial office building, glowing at night, that would present an unacceptable contrast to the solid masonry architecture of the historic building in its monumental context,” the commission wrote in a May 2020 letter to a Fed official. By July 2020, however, the Fed's architects came back with a new proposal, which included “panels of white Georgia marble"" which would be used for the “base, cornice, and other details, consistent with the historic building,"" the commission's minutes said. Stroik, now a professor of architecture at the University of Notre Dame, said in an interview that “stone buildings don’t necessarily have to cost a fortune.” But he acknowledged that the commission had not discussed expenses, which has not been part of its mission. “If they wanted to play the cost game, you do a marble facade and you do the glass facade and you compare the cost,” Stroik said. “And you know, they never did that."" Krieger, the former commission member, noted that the body’s discussions became much more contentious after the Trump administration removed several members and replaced them with Stroik and James McCrery, a professor at Catholic University, whom he said often echoed the sentiments in a then- draft executive order from Trump that extolled classical architecture. “At the time, it was a fierce battle over how literal to the original design should the renovations be,” Krieger said. “Normally, that attitude does add costs to the construction project.” McCrery declined to comment. Trump issued the executive order in December 2020, which criticized modernist architecture and expressed a preference for “beautiful"" classical buildings with more traditional designs. Biden revoked the order, and Trump reissued it the first day of his second term. The commission did not fully approve the Fed’s project until September 2021, after McCrery and another Trump appointee, Justin Shubow, had been removed by then President Joe Biden. __ Associated Press writer Seung Min Kim contributed to this report.

"CSX Stock Rally: Strong Options Flow, Analyst Price Targets",https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/csx-stock-rally-strong-options-flow-analyst-price-targets/,"When a wave of bullish activity from different corners of the market converges on a single, vital company, it can signal that a significant shift is underway. For CSX Corporation NASDAQ: CSX, a critical artery of the American economy, those signals are now flashing brightly. A powerful combination of unusual options market activity, positive analyst revisions, and strategic internal victories suggests the railroad giant is at a key inflection point, making a compelling case for investor attention. The most direct signals often come from the market itself, and recent activity surrounding CSX has been unambiguous. On July 11th, the options market saw a dramatic spike in interest, with traders purchasing over 24,000 call options on the stock. This represented a 165% increase compared to the typical daily volume of around 9,200 contracts. A call option gives a trader the right to buy a stock at a predetermined price, making it a direct bet that the share price will rise. When call volume surges like this, especially for contracts expiring in the near future, such as the heavily traded August and September 2025 options, it indicates a growing conviction that a positive catalyst is on the horizon. This sentiment is further confirmed by a low put-to-call ratio, a metric that shows a strong preference for bullish bets over bearish ones. This market action is supported by a growing chorus of optimism from CSX’s analyst community. In the weeks leading up to the company’s second-quarter earnings report, several influential firms have upgraded their outlook on CSX stock: When a surge in options buying aligns with positive analyst revisions, it creates a powerful leading indicator. It suggests that short-term market sentiment and long-term fundamental analysis are pointing toward the same conclusion: confidence in CSX’s future is building. The market’s growing optimism is anchored in tangible, fundamental improvements within the company. CSX management has been proactively addressing its most significant operational risks, creating a more stable and efficient business engine that is ready to perform. A landmark achievement was the June 2025 ratification of a new five-year collective bargaining agreement with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET). With this and other recent deals, CSX has now secured long-term labor stability with nearly 75% of its unionized workforce. In an industry where nationwide labor disputes can cause crippling service disruptions, supply chain chaos, and billions in economic damage, this predictability is a powerful competitive advantage. It allows CSX to provide reliable service guarantees to customers, which supports stronger pricing and helps win business from less stable competitors. Simultaneously, the company has demonstrated a sharp focus on its cost structure. The recent decision to reduce its management layers is a strategic move aimed at creating a leaner, more agile organization. By streamlining operations and controlling overhead expenses, CSX is directly improving its ability to convert every dollar of revenue into profit. This financial discipline is crucial for shareholders, as it means that when revenue growth returns, more of that money can flow directly to the bottom line, boosting earnings per share (EPS) and supporting a higher stock valuation. Investors examining CSX’s recent history will immediately notice the challenging first-quarter financial results, where both revenue and profit fell short of Wall Street estimates. However, understanding the context behind those numbers is the key to seeing the current investment opportunity. The first-quarter weakness did not result from a core business flaw. Instead, performance was significantly impacted by temporary and costly operational disruptions. These included major, large-scale infrastructure projects, such as service rerouting for the Howard Street Tunnel project in Baltimore and a massive $133 million rebuilding effort on its Blue Ridge subdivision following a hurricane. These non-recurring events, combined with severe winter weather, created a perfect storm of short-term drags on efficiency and profitability. Because these issues were situational, rather than structural, the market may have unfairly penalized the stock. This creates a potential valuation gap for investors who can look past the noise of a single difficult quarter. With those major projects largely complete and network operations returning to normal, the stage is set for a strong sequential improvement. The stock's price may not yet fully reflect this return to operational normalcy, presenting an opportunity before the company's comeback is confirmed in its next earnings report scheduled for after the market closes on July 23, 2025. Having successfully navigated its most significant internal challenges, CSX now emerges as a leaner, more stable, and more efficient operator. By securing labor peace and streamlining its costs, the company has fortified its foundation and sharpened its competitive edge. As a bellwether for the U.S. economy, the company’s performance is intrinsically linked to the activity of the industrial sector. Now, with its internal house in order, CSX can be viewed as a coiled spring, uniquely positioned to leverage any stabilization or modest improvement in manufacturing, consumer spending, or port volumes into significant earnings growth. The company has transformed itself into a more effective vehicle for capturing economic upside. The powerful combination of bullish market signals, validating Wall Street upgrades, and tangible internal improvements presents a compelling investment case. The upcoming second-quarter earnings announcement now stands as the next major catalyst, offering the first clear data points that could confirm this turnaround story is officially on track, unlocking the stock's next move higher.

Discover Capital One’s Strategy for Long-Term Stock Growth,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/discover-capital-ones-strategy-for-long-term-stock-growth/,"In mid-May of 2025, Capital One Financial Corporation NYSE: COF finalized its massive $35.3 billion acquisition of Discover Financial Services (DFS). This landmark move has already helped propel its stock more than 25% higher. This impressive performance has brought Capital One’s share price near all-time highs, leading investors to a critical question: after such a powerful run, is the best of the growth story already priced in? A detailed examination of the new company structure and strategy reveals that the transformation may be just beginning. The data presents a compelling case for continued long-term growth in the stock, built on a newly powerful and more profitable business model. The most important change from this merger is a concept known as vertical integration. Think of it this way: before the deal, Capital One was renting space on the payment highways owned by Visa and Mastercard. Every time a customer used a Capital One card, the company paid a toll. Now, by owning the Discover network, Capital One owns one of these major highways itself. This shift from network renter to network owner has a direct and significant financial impact. Management projects the deal will generate an estimated $2.7 billion in annual synergies by 2027. Synergies refer to the financial benefits that arise from the combination of two companies. In this case, they stem from cost savings (no longer paying tolls to Visa and Mastercard) and the new revenue opportunities that network ownership will bring them. For investors, this is critical. Those billions of dollars are expected to flow directly to the company's bottom line, increasing profits and making the business more valuable on a per-share basis. This establishes a new, recurring, and high-margin source of revenue, which is a powerful foundation for supporting a higher long-term stock valuation. Beyond the immediate benefits of owning a network, the merger creates several clear pathways to future growth. These catalysts are expected to fuel higher earnings and, consequently, a higher stock price over time. Even after its strong rally, a closer look at the company’s valuation and Capital One’s analyst data suggests the stock remains reasonably priced. A key metric for this is the forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), which compares a stock's current price to its expected earnings over the next 12 months. It’s a way of asking, ""What am I paying today for tomorrow's profits?"" With a forward P/E of approximately 14x, Capital One presents an attractive valuation. This is particularly notable given the company's clear trajectory for substantial earnings growth. In comparison, the financial sector's average forward P/E is around 15.5x, further indicating that Capital One's valuation still has potential for appreciation. Financial professionals and industry analysts echo this view. The consensus rating from 18 analysts is a Moderate Buy, with 14 recommending to Buy the stock. While four Hold ratings placed early in the year are still weighing down the overall rating, multiple firms have raised price targets or upgraded their ratings from Hold since the deal closed, suggesting that the remaining four holdouts may soon follow suit. These upgraded price targets, which represent analysts' 12-month forecasts for the stock's value, suggest plenty of room for growth. Since the company completed the merger, five firms have rerated the stock, with the average rerating placing it around $247.00.

Snap-On: Snap Up This Strong Signal While It’s Still Cheap,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/snap-on-snap-up-this-strong-signal-while-its-still-cheap/,"Snap-On’s NYSE: SNA stock price action threw a strong signal following the Q2 earnings release and outlook update, signalling that a rapid increase in share price will follow. The signal is a 6% increase in the share price, revealing a high degree of market commitment. The commitment is significant, as the move confirms support at the bottom of a critical range, aligning with the long-term uptrend and indicating that a minimum 12% upside remains ahead. The 12% upside will align this market with the all-time highs, a critical resistance target and pivot point, setting it up to set a new high and open the door to a more sustained rally for this industrial stock. Other indicators aligning with the bullish signal include trading volume, stochastic, and MACD indicators. The volume didn’t spike robustly but is up noticeably for the week and sufficient to be off interest, topping the 1.5 million mark and growing as of midweek of the report. Regarding the indicators, MACD and stochastic are firing strong bullish crossovers low in their respective ranges, indicating strengthening market support and a market with room to run. In this scenario, Snap-On stock can rally higher through the end of the quarter and year, easily setting new highs in the process.  Analysts' sentiment trends favor an upswing in Snap-On share prices and a rise to new all-time highs. Analysts' sentiment has cooled over the past few years but remains bullish, with the six current reports tracked by MarketBeat rating the stock as a Moderate Buy. The bias is bullish, with four of the six rating as an outright Buy, and the consensus target forecasts a 5% upside. The critical factor is that these analysts provide a bullish support base from which new coverage and price target increases can propel market sentiment. The high-end target of $400 is sufficient to put this stock well above its current all-time high. Likewise, the institutional trends align with a solid support base, uptrend, and potential for new all-time highs. The group, which owns approximately 85% of the stock, has been buying robustly this year, with Q1 and Q2 buying activity outpacing selling by more than 2-to-1 on a dollar basis. More importantly, their activity carried into Q3 and strengthened, with virtually no selling in the first two weeks of July, only buying to the tune of nearly $500 million. If these trends continue, Snap-On stock will have no choice but to more higher. Snap-On had a solid quarter in Q2, relieving market concerns over macroeconomic headwinds with the results and guidance update. The company reported $1.1 billion in revenue, flat compared to the prior year, and a full 100 basis points above MarketBeat’s reported consensus estimate. The strength was driven by Snap-On’s diversified model and operational quality, with Commercial & Industrial down slightly and offset by increases in the Tools and Repair segments. Margin news is also good. Holding steady year over year despite the impacts of tariffs and inflationary headwinds, GAAP EPS is at $4.72 or nearly 200 basis points above forecasts. Share buybacks aided the EPS, reducing the count nearly 1% for the quarter and YTD periods and are expected to continue through year’s end. Regarding the guidance, the company reaffirmed its outlook for the year, including for CAPE and effective tax rates, reassuring the market that it is on track for profitable growth. Snap-On’s balance sheet provides investors another reason to consider owning it. Not only is the company growing profitably and producing sufficient cash flow to sustain the capital return outlook, but it is also able to improve its fortress-quality balance sheet. Highlights at the end of Q2 include YTD increases in cash, receivables, inventories, and current and total assets, compounded by reduced liability. Equity is up significantly for this dividend-paying stock, and leverage is low, with the balance sheet showing net cash and debt of approximately 0.2 times the equity.
