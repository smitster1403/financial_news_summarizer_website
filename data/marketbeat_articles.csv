These tips from experts can help your teenager navigate AI companions,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/these-tips-from-experts-can-help-your-teenager-navigate-ai-companions-2025-07-22/,"As artificial intelligence technology becomes part of daily life, adolescents are turning to chatbots for advice, guidance and conversation. The appeal is clear: Chatbots are patient, never judgmental, supportive and always available. That worries experts who say the booming AI industry is largely unregulated and that many parents have no idea about how their kids are using AI tools or the extent of personal information they are sharing with chatbots. New research shows more than 70% of American teenagers have used AI companions and more than half converse with them regularly. The study by Common Sense Media focused on “AI companions,” like Character. AI, Nomi and Replika, which it defines as “digital friends or characters you can text or talk with whenever you want,” versus AI assistants or tools like ChatGPT, though it notes they can be used the same way. It’s important that parents understand the technology. Experts suggest some things parents can do to help protect their kids: — Start a conversation, without judgment, says Michael Robb, head researcher at Common Sense Media. Approach your teen with curiosity and basic questions: “Have you heard of AI companions?” “Do you use apps that talk to you like a friend?” Listen and understand what appeals to your teen before being dismissive or saying you’re worried about it. — Help teens recognize that AI companions are programmed to be agreeable and validating. Explain that’s not how real relationships work and that real friends with their own points of view can help navigate difficult situations in ways that AI companions cannot. “One of the things that's really concerning is not only what's happening on screen but how much time it’s taking kids away from relationships in real life,” says Mitch Prinstein, chief of psychology at the American Psychological Association. “We need to teach kids that this is a form of entertainment. It's not real, and it's really important they distinguish it from reality and should not have it replace relationships in your actual life.” The APA recently put out a health advisory on AI and adolescent well-being, and tips for parents. — Parents should watch for signs of unhealthy attachments. “If your teen is preferring AI interactions over real relationships or spending hours talking to AI companions, or showing that they are becoming emotionally distressed when separated from them — those are patterns that suggest AI companions might be replacing rather than complementing human connection,” Robb says. — Parents can set rules about AI use, just like they do for screen time and social media. Have discussions about when and how AI tools can and cannot be used. Many AI companions are designed for adult use and can mimic romantic, intimate and role-playing scenarios. While AI companions may feel supportive, children should understand the tools are not equipped to handle a real crisis or provide genuine mental health support. If kids are struggling with depression, anxiety, loneliness, an eating disorder or other mental health challenges, they need human support — whether it is family, friends or a mental health professional. — Get informed. The more parents know about AI, the better. “I don't think people quite get what AI can do, how many teens are using it and why it's starting to get a little scary,” says Prinstein, one of many experts calling for regulations to ensure safety guardrails for children. “A lot of us throw our hands up and say, ‘I don’t know what this is!' This sounds crazy!' Unfortunately, that tells kids if you have a problem with this, don't come to me because I am going to diminish it and belittle it.” Older teenagers have advice, too, for parents and kids. Banning AI tools is not a solution because the technology is becoming ubiquitous, says Ganesh Nair, 18. “Trying not to use AI is like trying to not use social media today. It is too ingrained in everything we do,” says Nair, who is trying to step back from using AI companions after seeing them affect real-life friendships in his high school. “The best way you can try to regulate it is to embrace being challenged.” “Anything that is difficult, AI can make easy. But that is a problem,” says Nair. “Actively seek out challenges, whether academic or personal. If you fall for the idea that easier is better, then you are the most vulnerable to being absorbed into this newly artificial world.” ___ The Associated Press’ education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

"Teens say they are turning to AI for advice, friendship and 'to get out of thinking'",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/teens-say-they-are-turning-to-ai-for-advice-friendship-and-to-get-out-of-thinking-2025-07-22/,"No question is too small when Kayla Chege, a high school student in Kansas, is using artificial intelligence. The 15-year-old asks ChatGPT for guidance on back-to-school shopping, makeup colors, low-calorie choices at Smoothie King, plus ideas for her Sweet 16 and her younger sister’s birthday party. The sophomore honors student makes a point not to have chatbots do her homework and tries to limit her interactions to mundane questions. But in interviews with The Associated Press and a new study, teenagers say they are increasingly interacting with AI as if it were a companion, capable of providing advice and friendship. “Everyone uses AI for everything now. It’s really taking over,” said Chege, who wonders how AI tools will affect her generation. “I think kids use AI to get out of thinking.” For the past couple of years, concerns about cheating at school have dominated the conversation around kids and AI. But artificial intelligence is playing a much larger role in many of their lives. AI, teens say, has become a go-to source for personal advice, emotional support, everyday decision-making and problem-solving. More than 70% of teens have used AI companions and half use them regularly, according to a new study from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using screens and digital media sensibly. The study defines AI companions as platforms designed to serve as “digital friends,” like Character.AI or Replika, which can be customized with specific traits or personalities and can offer emotional support, companionship and conversations that can feel human-like. But popular sites like ChatGPT and Claude, which mainly answer questions, are being used in the same way, the researchers say. As the technology rapidly gets more sophisticated, teenagers and experts worry about AI’s potential to redefine human relationships and exacerbate crises of loneliness and youth mental health. “AI is always available. It never gets bored with you. It’s never judgmental,” says Ganesh Nair, an 18-year-old in Arkansas. “When you’re talking to AI, you are always right. You’re always interesting. You are always emotionally justified.” All that used to be appealing, but as Nair heads to college this fall, he wants to step back from using AI. Nair got spooked after a high school friend who relied on an “AI companion” for heart-to-heart conversations with his girlfriend later had the chatbot write the breakup text ending his two-year relationship. “That felt a little bit dystopian, that a computer generated the end to a real relationship,” said Nair. “It’s almost like we are allowing computers to replace our relationships with people.” In the Common Sense Media survey, 31% of teens said their conversations with AI companions were “as satisfying or more satisfying” than talking with real friends. Even though half of teens said they distrust AI's advice, 33% had discussed serious or important issues with AI instead of real people. Those findings are worrisome, says Michael Robb, the study’s lead author and head researcher at Common Sense, and should send a warning to parents, teachers and policymakers. The now-booming and largely unregulated AI industry is becoming as integrated with adolescence as smartphones and social media are. “It’s eye-opening,” said Robb. “When we set out to do this survey, we had no understanding of how many kids are actually using AI companions.” The study polled more than 1,000 teens nationwide in April and May. Adolescence is a critical time for developing identity, social skills and independence, Robb said, and AI companions should complement — not replace — real-world interactions. “If teens are developing social skills on AI platforms where they are constantly being validated, not being challenged, not learning to read social cues or understand somebody else’s perspective, they are not going to be adequately prepared in the real world,” he said. The nonprofit analyzed several popular AI companions in a “ risk assessment,” finding ineffective age restrictions and that the platforms can produce sexual material, give dangerous advice and offer harmful content. The group recommends that minors not use AI companions. Researchers and educators worry about the cognitive costs for youth who rely heavily on AI, especially in their creativity, critical thinking and social skills. The potential dangers of children forming relationships with chatbots gained national attention last year when a 14-year-old Florida boy died by suicide after developing an emotional attachment to a Character.AI chatbot. “Parents really have no idea this is happening,” said Eva Telzer, a psychology and neuroscience professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. “All of us are struck by how quickly this blew up.” Telzer is leading multiple studies on youth and AI, a new research area with limited data. Telzer’s research has found that children as young as 8 are using generative AI and also found that teens are using AI to explore their sexuality and for companionship. In focus groups, Telzer found that one of the top apps teens frequent is SpicyChat AI, a free role-playing app intended for adults. Many teens also say they use chatbots to write emails or messages to strike the right tone in sensitive situations. “One of the concerns that comes up is that they no longer have trust in themselves to make a decision,” said Telzer. “They need feedback from AI before feeling like they can check off the box that an idea is OK or not.” Arkansas teen Bruce Perry, 17, says he relates to that and relies on AI tools to craft outlines and proofread essays for his English class. “If you tell me to plan out an essay, I would think of going to ChatGPT before getting out a pencil,” Perry said. He uses AI daily and has asked chatbots for advice in social situations, to help him decide what to wear and to write emails to teachers, saying AI articulates his thoughts faster. Perry says he feels fortunate that AI companions were not around when he was younger. “I’m worried that kids could get lost in this,” Perry said. “I could see a kid that grows up with AI not seeing a reason to go to the park or try to make a friend.” Other teens agree, saying the issues with AI and its effect on children’s mental health are different from those of social media. “Social media complemented the need people have to be seen, to be known, to meet new people,” Nair said. “I think AI complements another need that runs a lot deeper — our need for attachment and our need to feel emotions. It feeds off of that.” “It’s the new addiction,” Nair added. “That’s how I see it.” ___ The Associated Press’ education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

From tech podcasts to policy: Trump's new AI plan leans heavily on Silicon Valley industry ideas,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/from-tech-podcasts-to-policy-trumps-new-ai-plan-leans-heavily-on-silicon-valley-industry-ideas-2025-07-22/,"An artificial intelligence agenda that started coalescing on the podcasts of Silicon Valley billionaires is now being forged into U.S. policy as President Donald Trump leans on the ideas of the tech figures who backed his election campaign. Trump on Wednesday is planning to reveal an “AI Action Plan” he ordered after returning to the White House in January. He gave his tech advisers six months to come up with new AI policies after revoking President Joe Biden's signature AI guardrails on his first day in office. The unveiling is co-hosted by the bipartisan Hill and Valley Forum and the All-In Podcast, a business and technology show hosted by four tech investors and entrepreneurs who include Trump’s AI czar, David Sacks. The plan and related executive orders are expected to include some familiar tech lobby pitches. That includes accelerating the sale of AI technology abroad and making it easier to construct the energy-hungry data center buildings that are needed to form and run AI products, according to a person briefed on Wednesday’s event who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. It might also include some of the AI culture war preoccupations of the circle of venture capitalists who endorsed Trump last year. Countering the liberal bias they see in AI chatbots such as ChatGPT or Google's Gemini has long been a rallying point for the tech industry's loudest Trump backers. Sacks, a former PayPal executive and now Trump's top AI adviser, has been criticizing “woke AI” for more than a year, fueled by Google's February 2024 rollout of an AI image generator that, when asked to show an American Founding Father, created pictures of Black, Latino and Native American men. “The AI’s incapable of giving you accurate answers because it’s been so programmed with diversity and inclusion,” Sacks said at the time. Google quickly fixed its tool, but the “Black George Washington” moment remained a parable for the problem of AI's perceived political bias, taken up by X owner Elon Musk, venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, Vice President JD Vance and Republican lawmakers. The administration’s latest push against “woke AI” comes a week after the Pentagon announced new $200 million contracts with four leading AI companies, including Google, to address “critical national security challenges.” Also receiving one of the contracts was Musk’s xAI, which has been pitched as an alternative to “woke AI” companies. The company has faced its own challenges: Earlier this month, xAI had to scramble to remove posts made by its Grok chatbot that made antisemitic comments and praised Adolf Hitler. Trump has paired AI's need for huge amounts of electricity with his own push to tap into U.S. energy sources, including gas, coal and nuclear. “Everything we aspire to and hope for means the demand and supply of energy in America has to go up,” said Michael Kratsios, the director of the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy, in a video posted Tuesday. Many tech giants are already well on their way toward building new data centers in the U.S. and around the world. OpenAI announced this week that it has switched on the first phase of a massive data center complex in Abilene, Texas, part of an Oracle-backed project known as Stargate that Trump promoted earlier this year. Amazon, Microsoft, Meta and xAI also have major projects underway. The tech industry has pushed for easier permitting rules to get their computing facilities connected to power, but the AI building boom has also contributed to spiking demand for fossil fuel production that will contribute to global warming. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday called on the world’s major tech firms to power data centers completely with renewables by 2030. “A typical AI data center eats up as much electricity as 100,000 homes,” Guterres said. “By 2030, data centers could consume as much electricity as all of Japan does today.” It's long been White House policy under Republican and Democratic administrations to curtail certain technology exports to China and other adversaries on national security grounds. But much of the tech industry argued that Biden went too far at the end of his term in trying to restrict the exports of specialized AI computer chips to more than 100 other countries, including close allies. Part of the Biden administration's motivation was to stop China from acquiring coveted AI chips in third-party locations such as Southeast Asia or the Middle East, but critics said the measures would end up encouraging more countries to turn to China's fast-growing AI industry instead of the U.S. as their technology supplier. It remains to be seen how the Trump administration aims to accelerate the export of U.S.-made AI technologies while countering China's AI ambitions. California chipmakers Nvidia and AMD both announced last week that they won approval from the Trump administration to sell to China some of their advanced computer chips used to develop artificial intelligence. AMD CEO Lisa Su is among the guests planning to attend Trump's event Wednesday. There are sharp debates on how to regulate AI, even among the influential venture capitalists who have been debating it on their favorite medium: the podcast. While some Trump backers, particularly Andreessen, have advocated an “accelerationist” approach that aims to speed up AI advancement with minimal regulation, Sacks has described himself as taking a middle road of techno-realism. “Technology is going to happen. Trying to stop it is like ordering the tides to stop. If we don’t do it, somebody else will,” Sacks said on the All-In podcast. On Tuesday, 95 groups including labor unions, parent groups, environmental justice organizations and privacy advocates signed a resolution opposing Trump’s embrace of industry-driven AI policy and calling for a “People’s AI Action Plan” that would “deliver first and foremost for the American people.” Amba Kak, co-executive director of the AI Now Institute, which helped lead the effort, said the coalition expects Trump’s plan to come “straight from Big Tech’s mouth.” “Every time we say, ‘What about our jobs, our air, water, our children?’ they’re going to say, ‘But what about China?’” she said in a call with reporters Tuesday. She said Americans should reject the White House’s argument that the industry is overregulated and fight to preserve “baseline protections for the public” as AI technology advances. ___ Associated Press writer Seung Min Kim in Washington contributed to this report.

"Asian markets gain, with Japan's Nikkei up more than 3%, lifted by deal on Trump's tariffs",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/asian-markets-gain-with-japans-nikkei-up-more-than-3-lifted-by-deal-on-trumps-tariffs-2025-07-22/,"TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares rallied on Wednesday, with Tokyo’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index up more than 3% after Japan and the U.S. announced a deal on President Donald Trump’s tariffs. The agreement as announced calls for a 15% import duty on goods imported from Japan, apart from certain products such as steel and aluminum that are subject to much higher tariffs. That’s down from the 25% Trump had said would kick in on Aug. 1 if a deal was not reached. “This Deal will create Hundreds of Thousands of Jobs — There has never been anything like it,” Trump posted on Truth Social, noting that Japan was also investing “at my direction” $550 billion into the U.S. He said Japan would “open” its economy to American autos and rice. Hong Kong's Hang Seng jumped 1.1% to 25,397.81, while the Shanghai Composite index gained 0.8% to 3,608.58. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 edged up 0.6% to 8,731.90 and the Kospi in South Korea edged 0.1% higher to 3,172.10. “President Trump has signed two trade deals this week with the Philippines and Japan which is likely to keep market sentiment propped up despite deals with the likes of the EU and South Korea remaining elusive, for now at least,” Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at Kohle Capital Markets, said in a report. There was a chorus of no comments from the Japanese automakers, despite the latest announcement, including Toyota Motor Corp., Honda Motor Co and Nissan Motor Corp. Japanese companies tend to be cautious about their public reactions, and some business officials have privately remarked in off-record comments that they hesitate to say anything because Trump keeps changing his mind. The Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association also said it had no comment, noting there was no official statement yet. Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba welcomed the agreement as beneficial to both sides. Wall Street inched to another record on Tuesday following some mixed profit reports, as General Motors  and other big U.S. companies gave updates on how much Trump’s tariffs are hurting or helping them. The S&P 500 added 0.1% to the all-time high it had set the day before, closing at 6,309.62. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4% to 44,502.44. The Nasdaq composite slipped 0.4% from its own record, to 20,892.68. General Motors dropped 8.1% despite reporting a stronger profit for the spring than analysts expected. The automaker said it’s still expecting a $4 billion to $5 billion hit to its results in 2025 from higher tariffs and that it hopes to mitigate 30% of that. GM also said it will feel more pain because of tariffs in the current quarter than it did during the spring. That helped to offset big gains for some homebuilders after they reported stronger profits for the spring than Wall Street had forecast. D.R. Horton rallied 17%, and PulteGroup jumped 11.5%. That was even as both companies said homebuyers are continuing to deal with challenging conditions, including higher mortgage rates  and an uncertain economy. So far, the U.S. economy seems to be powering  through the uncertainty created by Trump’s on-and-off tariffs. Many of Trump’s proposed taxes on imports are currently on pause, and the next big deadline is Aug. 1. Talks are underway on possible trade deals with other countries that could lower the stiff proposals before they kick in. Trump said he reached a trade agreement with the Philippines following a meeting Tuesday at the White House, that will see the U.S. slightly drop its tariff rate for the Philippines without paying import taxes for what it sells there. In the bond market, Treasury yields sank as traders continue to expect the Federal Reserve to wait until September at the earliest to resume cutting interest rates. The yield on the 10-year Treasury eased to 4.34% from 4.38% late Monday. In other dealings early Wednesday, U.S. benchmark crude oil gained 14 cents to $65.45 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard added 18 cents to $68.77 a barrel. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar inched up to 146.80 Japanese yen from 146.64 yen. The euro cost $1.1745, down from $1.1754. ___ AP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed. Before you consider General Motors, you'll want to hear this.

Appeals court won't reinstate AP access to presidential events,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/appeals-court-wont-reinstate-ap-access-to-presidential-events-2025-07-22/,"The U.S. Court of Appeals on Tuesday denied an appeal by The Associated Press for a hearing on its efforts to restore full access to cover presidential events, not ending its case but allowing the White House to continue its control over access to President Donald Trump. The news outlet wanted the court to overturn a three-judge panel's June 6 ruling not to let AP back into the events until merits of the news organization's lawsuit against Trump was decided. But the court on Tuesday declined to hear that appeal. It all stems from Trump's decision in February to keep AP journalists out of the Oval Office, Air Force One and other events too small for a full press corps, in retaliation for the news outlet's decision not to follow his lead in changing the Gulf of Mexico's name. The AP sued in response. In April, a district court ruled that the administration could not exclude journalists based on their opinions. The Trump administration immediately turned to the U.S. Court of Appeals to successfully delay implementation of the ruling before the court could consider the full merits of the case. Next up: This fall, the appeals court considers those full merits. “We are disappointed by today's procedural decision but remain focused on the strong district court opinion in support of free speech as we have our case heard,” said Patrick Maks, an AP spokesman. “As we've said throughout, the press and the public have a fundamental right to speak freely without government retaliation.” The White House did not immediately return a request for comment. Since the start of the case, the White House has instituted new rules for access to the limited-space events. AP photographers have been regularly permitted back, but its reporters only occasionally. On Monday, the White House said it would not allow a reporter from The Wall Street Journal onto Air Force One to cover Trump's weekend trip to Scotland because of the outlet's “fake and defamatory conduct” in a story about the president and late financier Jeffrey Epstein. ___ David Bauder writes about media for the AP.

Trump announces trade deal with Japan that lowers threatened tariff to 15%,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-announces-trade-deal-with-japan-that-lowers-threatened-tariff-to-15-2025-07-22/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump announced a trade framework with Japan on Tuesday, placing a 15% tax on goods imported from that nation. “This Deal will create Hundreds of Thousands of Jobs — There has never been anything like it,” Trump posted on Truth Social, adding that the United States “will continue to always have a great relationship with the Country of Japan.” The president said Japan would invest “at my direction” $550 billion into the U.S. and would “open” its economy to American autos and rice. The 15% tax on imported Japanese goods is a meaningful drop from the 25% rate that Trump, in a recent letter to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, said would be levied starting Aug. 1. Early Wednesday, Ishiba acknowledged the new trade agreement, saying it would benefit both sides and help them work together. With the announcement, Trump is seeking to tout his ability as a dealmaker — even as his tariffs, when initially announced in early April led to a market panic and fears of slower growth that for the moment appear to have subsided. Key details remained unclear from his post, such as whether Japanese-built autos would face a higher 25% tariff that Trump imposed on the sector. But the framework fits a growing pattern for Trump, who is eager to portray the tariffs as win for the U.S. His administration says the revenues will help reduce the budget deficit and more factories will relocate to America to avoid the import taxes and cause trade imbalances to disappear. The wave of tariffs continues to be a source of uncertainty about whether it could lead to higher prices for consumers and businesses if companies simply pass along the costs. The problem was seen sharply Tuesday after General Motors reported a 35% drop in its net income during the second quarter as it warned that tariffs would hit its business in the months ahead, causing its stock to tumble. As the Aug. 1 deadline for the tariff rates in his letters to world leaders is approaching, Trump also announced a trade framework with the Philippines that would impose a tariff of 19% on its goods, while American-made products would face no import taxes. The president also reaffirmed his 19% tariffs on Indonesia. The U.S. ran a $69.4 billion trade imbalance on goods with Japan last year, according to the Census Bureau. America had a trade imbalance of $17.9 billion with Indonesia and an imbalance of $4.9 billion with the Philippines. Both nations are less affluent than the U.S. and an imbalance means America imports more from those countries than it exports to them. The president is set to impose the broad tariffs listed in his recent letters to other world leaders on Aug. 1, raising questions of whether there will be any breakthrough in talks with the European Union. At a Tuesday dinner, Trump said the EU would be in Washington on Wednesday for trade talks. “We have Europe coming in tomorrow, the next day,” Trump told guests. The president earlier this month sent a letter threatening the 27 member states in the EU with 30% taxes on their goods to be imposed starting on Aug. 1. The Trump administration has a separate negotiating period with China that is currently set to run through Aug. 12 as goods from that nation are taxed at an additional 30% baseline. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he would be in the Swedish capital of Stockholm next Monday and Tuesday to meet with his Chinese counterparts. Bessent said his goal is to shift the American economy away from consumption and to enable more consumer spending in the manufacturing-heavy Chinese economy. “President Trump is remaking the U.S. into a manufacturing economy,” Bessent said on the Fox Business Network show “Mornings with Maria.” “If we could do that together, we do more manufacturing, they do more consumption. That would be a home run for the global economy.” __ Associated Press writer Mari Yamaguchi contributed from Tokyo. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

In-N-Out Burger CEO to join the list of high-profile business figures to leave California,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/in-n-out-burger-ceo-to-join-the-list-of-high-profile-business-figures-to-leave-california-2025-07-22/,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — As California’s much-loved hamburger chain In-N-Out Burger expands across the country into Tennessee, billionaire owner and CEO Lynsi Snyder has announced she and her family are going with it and heading east, too. “There are a lot of great things about California, but raising a family is not easy here,” Snyder announced last week on the “Relatable” podcast, hosted by conservative commentator Allie Beth Stuckey. “Doing business is not easy here.” Snyder said the corporate headquarters will remain in California. The company announced in 2023 that it planned to open a corporate office in Tennessee, along with restaurants in and around Nashville. With her move to Tennessee, Snyder becomes the latest high-profile business figure to decamp a state known for its sunshine but also heavy taxes and regulation, progressive politics and a punishing cost of living. Other departures have included Charles Schwab and Chevron, which cited regulatory issues, taxes and high operating costs, and Elon Musk announced last year he was moving the headquarters of SpaceX and social media company X to Texas. He said at the time that a California law barring school districts from requiring staff to notify parents of their child’s gender identification change was the “final straw.” Snyder is the granddaughter of the chain’s founder, Harry Snyder, who opened his first drive-thru hamburger stand in Southern California in 1948. The California cachet has long been part of the brand's identity. According to its website, In-N-Out Burger has over 400 locations across eight states — California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, Texas, Oregon, Colorado and Idaho.

Trump says a China trip is 'not too distant' as trade tensions ease,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-says-a-china-trip-is-not-too-distant-as-trade-tensions-ease-2025-07-22/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Tuesday said a trip to China might be “not too distant,” raising prospects that the leaders of the world's two largest economies may meet soon to help reset relations after moving to climb down from a trade war. Trump made the remarks while hosting Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. at the White House, where he praised the “fantastic military relationship” with Manila as the U.S. looks to counter China's influence in the Indo-Pacific region. Yet, Trump still said the U.S. is “getting along with China very well. We have a very good relationship."" He added that Beijing has resumed shipping to the U.S. “record numbers” of much-needed rare earth magnets, which are used in iPhones and other high-tech products like electric vehicles. Widely speculated about since Trump returned to the White House, a summit between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping would be expected to stabilize — even for a short while — a difficult relationship defined by mistrust and competition. Beijing believes a leader-level summit is necessary to steady U.S.-China relations and that Trump must be wooed because he has the final say on America's policy toward China, despite more hawkish voices in his Cabinet, observers say. The question, however, is when. Danny Russel, a distinguished fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said Trump has consistently shown his hunger for a visit to China and that Beijing has used that to bolster leverage. “As soon as the leadership in Beijing is satisfied that Trump will be on his best behavior and will accept terms for a deal that they think are favorable, they will give a green light to the visit,” Russel said. Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Washington-based think tank Stimson Center, said a visit “is in the making” with two sides likely to strike a trade deal. What Trump said might mean the visit would not be in September but ""potentially November, but still depends on whether they play ball on trade and other things we want,"" Sun said. Trump's campaign to impose tariffs on other countries kicked off a high-stake trade war with Beijing. China raised tariffs on U.S. goods to 125% in response to Trump's hiking the tax on Chinese goods to 145%. Both sides also imposed on each other harsh trade restrictions on critical products: China on rare earths, and the U.S. on computing chips and jet engine technology. Trade tensions, however, eased following two rounds of high-level talks in Geneva and London, when the two sides agreed to lower tariffs — pending a more permanent deal by mid-August — and pull back on trade restrictions. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday on Fox Business' “Mornings with Maria” that he will be meeting with his Chinese counterparts in Stockholm next week to work on “what is likely an extension” of the Aug. 12 deadline. “I think trade is in a very good place with China,"" Bessent told host Maria Bartiromo. “Hopefully, we can see the Chinese pull back on some of this glut of manufacturing that they're doing and concentrate on building a consumer economy.” He said he also expects to bring up China's purchases of Russian and Iranian oil and Beijing's role in aiding Moscow in its war against Ukraine. Beijing has not announced any travel plans for Vice Premier He Lifeng, who led trade negotiations in both Geneva and London on behalf of the Chinese government, but it is not unusual for China to make such announcements closer to a travel date. In a possible friendly gesture, Beijing on Tuesday said it suspended an antitrust investigation into chemical maker DuPont’s operations in China. China's State Administration for Market Regulation made the announcement in a one-line statement but gave no explanation for the decision. DuPont said in a statement that it is “pleased"" with China's action. Chinese regulators launched the investigation in April against DuPont China Group, a subsidiary of the chemical giant, as part of Beijing’s broad, retaliatory response to Trump’s sky-high tariffs. Beijing also has agreed to approve export permits for rare earth elements and rare earth magnets that U.S. manufacturers need to build cars, robots, wind turbines and other high-tech products. The U.S. has eased restrictions on some advanced chips and other technologies. ___ Associated Press writers Josh Boak and Fu Ting in Washington contributed to this report.

Amazon Stock Rally Hits New Highs: Buy Into Earnings?,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/amazon-stock-rally-hits-new-highs-buy-into-earnings/,"Tech giant Amazon.com Inc NASDAQ: AMZN continues to make a strong case for being one of the market’s top momentum plays of the year to date. Shares closed just below $230 on Monday night after a 1.4% pop extended its multi-month rally to fresh highs. The stock has been up more than 40% since April and is within striking distance of reclaiming February’s all-time high. Much of this run was fueled by the broad return to risk-on sentiment seen in equities in recent months, but Amazon’s stellar Q1 report at the start of May also had an impact. With the company due to release its latest numbers next week, those of us on the sidelines are right to be asking if we should be getting involved ahead of the release, or if it makes more sense to wait until after. Let’s look at two reasons to buy Amazon before the report, and one to wait. This rally has barely blinked in recent months. Since April, Amazon has consistently printed higher highs and higher lows, with no significant pullbacks, indicating strong and consistent demand on the bid. In many ways, it’s been a textbook recovery, and while you might expect conditions to be overheating, that’s not yet the case. Even with the ongoing rally, the stock’s relative strength index (RSI) sits at a healthy 66, strong, but far from overbought, suggesting there’s still room to run before any cooling off or profit-taking kicks in. The uptrend remains intact, with the bulls firmly in control. It’s a strong signal that the market expects the rally to continue through earnings, making this an attractive setup for momentum-focused investors. Another key reason to consider Amazon ahead of earnings is the unwavering analyst support it continues to attract. This trend has remained strong in recent weeks and shows no signs of slowing, with bullish commentary and target hikes continuing to roll in. Just yesterday, July 21, the team at Robert Baird reiterated their Outperform rating and boosted their price target to $244. That follows last week’s update from Jefferies, which reiterated its own Buy rating while raising its target to $265. These moves echoed those of others like Morgan Stanley, which earlier this month came out with one of the most bullish calls yet: a $300 price target that implies around 30% upside from current levels. Given how binary earnings results can be, the fact that Amazon is still attracting big calls like these in the days and weeks before its upcoming report speaks volumes to Wall Street’s confidence in it being a good one. Of course, no stock rallies forever without pause, and next week’s numbers will be a big test for Amazon. The recent surge has pushed Amazon’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio up to 37, making it one of the more expensive names in big tech. Compare that to Alphabet Inc.’s NASDAQ: GOOGL 21 or Meta Platforms Inc.’s NASDAQ: META 27, and you get a sense of how the stakes are for Amazon to back up the rally. That’s precisely where the risk lies. With high expectations, any stumble, whether in AWS revenue, AI commentary, or broader forward guidance, could easily take some of the air out of the rally. Options pricing suggests investors are bracing for a post-earnings move, and history shows Amazon isn’t immune to profit-taking after big runs. So while the uptrend is intact and the sentiment is bullish, depending on your risk appetite, it may make more sense to hold off until the uncertainty has been removed. That said, Amazon is undeniably one of the top trending stocks in the market right now. The combination of price action, analyst support, and fundamental strength makes it a tempting buy into earnings. But with valuation now full and expectations high, those of us tempted to pick up some shares beforehand must be aware of the risk of anything less than a stellar report.

What's happening with forgiveness for student loans on income-based repayment plans?,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/whats-happening-with-forgiveness-for-student-loans-on-income-based-repayment-plans-2025-07-22/,"NEW YORK (AP) — Amid a federal overhaul of student loan plans, many borrowers have been left wondering what it means for their hopes of loan forgiveness. In particular, those who are enrolled in a repayment plan known as income-based repayment, or IBR, have wondered if forgiveness will still be available to them. A recent update from the Education Department said forgiveness through the IBR plan is paused while systems are updated. “IBR forgiveness will resume once those updates are completed,” the agency said. IBR is not affected by a federal court's injunction blocking former President Joe Biden's Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan. The IBR plan was created by Congress separately from other existing repayment plans, including those known as PAYE and ICR. It's also exempt from some changes coming from President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill. Here's what to know. Following a court injunction last summer, loan forgiveness for the SAVE, Income-Contingent Repayment, or ICR, and Pay As You Earn, or PAYE, plans is currently paused because those plans were not created by Congress. The legal action called into question whether student loan forgiveness was authorized under the federal statute that governs those plans. The IBR plan was created under a different authority. IBR, created by Congress, reduces monthly payments for borrowers with lower incomes. It also invokes a statute that authorizes student loan forgiveness of the balance at the end of a 20- or 25-year repayment term. The Education Department hasn't given a timeline for when its system update will be complete and forgiveness will resume. Borrowers enrolled in IBR who have reached the threshold for forgiveness but who are not seeing their loans discharged as a result of the pause may continue to make payments with the expectation that the Education Department will refund the excess payments. The plan offers forgiveness after 240 or 300 monthly payments, depending on when borrowers enrolled. Borrowers can also request forbearance from their loan servicer. In that case, interest would continue to accrue on any remaining balance. Trump's tax and spending law will eventually phase out the ICR, PAYE and SAVE plans, replacing them with the Repayment Assistance Plan. IBR plans will continue to exist and to provide forgiveness after 20 or 25 years. RAP, in contrast, will require 30 years of repayment before forgiveness is granted. ___ The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

Forget the Hype—TSMC Is the AI Stock That Actually Delivers,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/forget-the-hypetsmc-is-the-ai-stock-that-actually-delivers/,"One of the longer-term booms in the stock market right now is right at the center of the technology sector, as the space is responsible for most of the returns now in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 indexes. This feature is likely to continue into the future, considering how relatively early it is in the artificial intelligence race not only in the United States but worldwide. With this tailwind in mind, investors can start to build their portfolio ideas and criteria around the companies that are best positioned to grow from this technology race, in some of the names that not only hold a large portion of the market but that also have made themselves indispensable for others who rely on them to keep developing the right technology and grabbing more market share. This is exactly where shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing NYSE: TSM come into play for savvy investors who want to avoid other hyped-up names that operate near the bottom of the value chain. As a primary chipmaker and equipment provider, Taiwan Semiconductor’s positioning at the top of the value chain enables it to receive payment before these other companies, and this theme is reflected in the company’s earnings themselves. Starting with the top line, Taiwan Semiconductor’s latest quarterly earnings show investors a net revenue growth of up to 44% over the past year, which should erase most (if not all) of the fears currently present for the industry as President Trump keeps ramping up a tariff placement for China and other heavy semiconductor buyers. This significant revenue growth indicates that the industry itself isn’t slowing down, and that Taiwan Semiconductor is not affected by the macroeconomic backdrop. If anything, it suggests that its leadership position has been maintained. Here is what really matters for the future. However, Taiwan Semiconductor’s revenue was mostly focused on its 7nm and below wafers, which are currently being used to develop the latest artificial intelligence chips and data centers, considering they have the most computing power. Up to 74% of revenue came from these products, indicating little to no competition among other companies that depend on Taiwan Semiconductor as their primary supplier. This positioning, of course, translates to a high gross profit margin of up to 57.5% and net income growth of as much as 60.7% over the year. Knowing that earnings per share (EPS) drive most stock returns, investors shouldn’t be surprised to see the stock now trade at up to 96% of its 52-week high, an area where Taiwan Semiconductor could also be flirting with making a new all-time high. Even with all of this new demand from customers like NVIDIA Co. NASDAQ: NVDA and Apple Inc. NASDAQ: AAPL, Taiwan Semiconductor’s management felt confident enough that guidance should be raised for future quarters and the end of 2025 as a fiscal year, which is where the benefit of being a $1 trillion company comes in as an ability to pivot. Over the past month, up to 22.2% of Taiwan Semiconductor’s short interest was wiped out from the balance, showing every investor a clear sign of bearish capitulation. The fact is that, as these financial results continue to show resilient momentum and growth, this company will also continue to create a higher ceiling for itself. Investors can also see this happening as Charles Shi from Needham & Company reiterated his Buy rating on Taiwan Semiconductor stock, this time also boosting his valuation target to $270 per share. This call would not only imply the company can break into a new 52-week high, but also deliver an additional 14% upside from today’s prices. Another factor investors should keep in mind is what the so-called “smart money” is doing with Taiwan Semiconductor stock, and the answer boils down to one word: buying. Momentum and fundamental-driven money managers are having a blast seeing what this company is doing, which is why a new buyer came in the day after earnings were released. Those from Ninety One UK Ltd decided to boost their holdings in Taiwan Semiconductor stock by 1.2% as of July 2025. While this may not sound like much on a percentage basis, this new allocation brought their position to a new high of $454.3 million today, also acting as another vote of confidence for the stock's future. Chances are that, as the company continues to dominate the artificial intelligence boom and the entire industry, better earnings and financials will be reported, leading to new highs in the stock price and triggering increased institutional buying pressure to initiate a virtuous cycle for shareholders.

Why Lucid’s 36% Rally on Uber Deal Could Be a Game-Changer,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/why-lucids-36-rally-on-uber-deal-could-be-a-game-changer/,"Electric vehicle (EV) stock Lucid Group NASDAQ: LCID just had its best day in two and a half years. On July 17, Lucid shares rose more than 36%, putting the stock’s total return in 2025 at just under 1%. This comes after the company made a joint announcement with the world’s largest ride-sharing company, Uber Technologies NYSE: UBER. The two are forging a significant partnership in autonomous vehicles (AVs). Let's break down the deal below and what it means for both firms. Uber is aiming to deploy 20,000 or more Lucid cars for its next-gen robotaxi program. While Lucid will supply its Gravity SUV, Nuro will provide the program's autonomous capabilities. The company’s AI-first self-driving system, Nuro Driver, will give the vehicles Level 4 autonomy. This means that, in most circumstances, human intervention is not required. Lucid, Uber, and Nuro hope to deploy these 20,000 vehicles over the next six years, with the first launch in a major U.S. city in 2026. That would allow for a fairly substantial increase in Lucid’s delivery volume. Over the last 12 months, Lucid delivered approximately 11,400 cars. If Lucid adds one-sixth of the 20,000 vehicles to its deliveries over the next 12 months, this could create a 29% increase in its deliveries, all else being equal. While this would help increase the company’s revenues, that’s far from the only benefit to Lucid. This added volume also has the potential to aid Lucid’s margins significantly. Up-and-coming EV companies typically suffer from profoundly negative margins, and Lucid is no exception. In Q1, Lucid posted a gross margin of negative 97%. This means that the cost of just the materials and labor needed to make the vehicles they delivered was nearly twice the revenue they generated. Thus, the company lost thousands of dollars on each car it sold. Higher delivery volume should move Lucid’s gross margins closer to zero, the first key step in achieving profitability.With tens of thousands of riders set to experience Lucid vehicles via Uber, the brand will receive a marketing boost. If even a small percentage of those robotaxi users decide to purchase a Lucid car for personal use, the company's sales would increase. As part of the agreement, Uber is investing $300 million directly into Lucid, giving the ride-hailing giant a stake in the company’s success—and Lucid a much-needed capital infusion to support production scaling. But there are still some unknowns. For example, the financial specifics of the full contract haven’t been disclosed. Once this happens, markets could view the deal in a less favorable light. Still, the partnership is a solidly positive development for this small EV company’s future if it executes properly on production and deliveries. From Uber's perspective, the new partnership represents a significant new cost, likely in the multi-billion dollar range. This is the main reason shares were down slightly on the day of the announcement. Still, it is important for the company to stay competitive in the AV market. Given that Uber sees this as becoming a “multi-trillion dollar market,"" sitting on the sidelines isn’t an option if it wants to capitalize. Still, Alphabet’s NASDAQ: GOOG Waymo and Tesla NASDAQ: TSLA are currently the leaders in this space, while Uber is playing catch-up. Uber lacks proprietary self-driving technology and relies instead on a network of partnerships, including not just Lucid and Nuro, but also Waymo and Aurora. This puts the company’s eggs in many different baskets, allowing it to shift more demand to the best partnership over time. However, it also demonstrates how Uber generally lacks a true technological advantage. With Lucid, Uber is betting on a relatively small EV player that has faced production issues, introducing risk that the ambitious ramp timeline will face setbacks. Still, the vast scale Uber has reached with its traditional ride-hailing service remains a reason to be optimistic about its AV strategy. In the short term, Lucid is the bigger beneficiary of the partnership, as demonstrated by both stocks' price action. LCID’s surge shows investors believe this deal could finally jumpstart the company’s slow climb toward profitability and scale. For Uber, the upside is less certain. The investment seems more of a strategic necessity than a growth catalyst, keeping Uber in the game despite the high risk. Still, both names stand to benefit significantly if the partnership proves to be fruitful. Before you consider Lucid Group, you'll want to hear this.

Block Levels Up: What S&P 500 Inclusion Means for Investors,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/block-levels-up-what-s-and-p-500-inclusion-means-for-investors/,"Shares of Block NYSE: XYZ have surged after the announcement that the financial technology company will join the prestigious S&P 500 index. This milestone validates the company’s evolution from a niche payment innovator to a diversified powerhouse in the financial sector, positioning it among the largest and most influential public companies in the United States. The immediate stock rally (pushing the stock up around 11%) reflects the significance of this news. For investors, the central question now is whether the company’s underlying business fundamentals can support this new, higher valuation and drive further growth long after the initial excitement of being included subsides. Block’s addition to the S&P 500, effective at the market open on July 23, provides more than a symbolic victory; it creates a tangible lift for the stock. The S&P 500 is the primary benchmark for the U.S. stock market, with trillions of dollars in passive index funds and ETFs designed to replicate its holdings. This creates a market event that analysts refer to as forced buying. For these massive funds to do their job, their managers must purchase Block shares for their portfolios. This generates a significant, near-term wave of demand independent of the company’s day-to-day performance. Beyond this initial demand surge, the inclusion brings lasting benefits that can enhance shareholder value. It introduces the company to a broader base of institutional investors, which can lead to greater trading liquidity and potentially more stable price action over time. This event has already acted as a catalyst on Wall Street, prompting a series of positive analyst revisions and price target upgrades for Block, reinforcing the market’s renewed confidence in the company’s trajectory. While index inclusion provides a strong boost, a company's long-term value is always determined by the performance of its core businesses. A closer look at Block's two primary segments, Cash App and Square, reveals a clear and actionable strategy for accelerating growth. The story for Cash App has evolved. With a massive and stable base of 57 million monthly active users, the company’s focus has pivoted from pure user acquisition to deeper monetization. This strategy is already yielding results: in the first quarter of 2025, gross profit per active user increased 9% year-over-year to $81. Two key initiatives are expected to drive this monetization further. First, the nationwide expansion of Cash App Borrow, a short-term lending product, is now underway following recent approval from the FDIC. This move nearly doubles the product’s addressable market within the app’s user base, unlocking a significant high-margin revenue stream. Second, the formal integration of Afterpay’s Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) service directly into Cash App creates a powerful tool to drive commerce and credit adoption, making the platform more comprehensive for users to manage their finances. The Square ecosystem, which serves merchants, is demonstrating its competitive strength. In the first quarter, the segment’s 9% gross profit growth outpaced the broader payments industry, a clear signal that it is taking market share. This success is fueled by a deliberate push upmarket to serve larger, more complex businesses. Growth from sellers with over $500,000 in annualized sales is now accelerating faster than any other demographic. This strategy is proving effective, with Square recently signing partnerships with multi-location businesses, such as the 60-location chain Bambu Dessert Drinks, which chose Square for its advanced backend capabilities. This move upmarket increases payment volume and creates stickier customer relationships through integrated software, payroll, and banking services. Management has set clear expectations for the remainder of the year. The company is guiding for an acceleration of gross profit growth through the second half of 2025, with a target of exiting the year in the ""mid-teens"" growth range. The upcoming second-quarter earnings report, scheduled for August 7, 2025, has now become a critical event. It will offer investors the first significant data point to validate whether this growth story is on track. The S&P 500 inclusion has provided a strong catalyst and a vote of confidence from the market, establishing a new, higher valuation floor for the stock. Sustaining and building on this momentum will now depend on execution. Block's ability to deliver on its well-defined strategies for monetizing Cash App and expanding Square's upmarket presence will hold the key to the stock's long-term performance.

Investors breathe life into new batch of meme stocks as Kohl's and Opendoor Technologies surge,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/investors-breathe-life-into-new-batch-of-meme-stocks-as-kohls-opendoor-technologies-surge-2025-07-22/,"NEW YORK (AP) — As the stock market pushes into record territory and bargains become harder to find, investors are once again turning to some of Wall Street's beaten down companies in hopes of a quick score. The latest so-called meme stocks are the department store Kohl’s, which has surged this week, and the online-based real estate company Opendoor Technologies, which has skyrocketed this month. Both companies have been struggling in their respective sectors. Wall Street defines a meme stock as a stock that gains significant popularity and trading volume, primarily driven by social media hype and online communities, rather than the company’s fundamental financial performance. Think GameStop and AMC Entertainment in 2021, and a few subsequent instances. Often, meme stocks are initially the target of “short sellers,” or investors betting against the stock. If other investors start buying the shares and boost the price, that could prompt the people betting against the stock to buy more shares to cushion their own losses. Kohl’s, which operates 1,600 stores across the country, has risen almost 50% this week. It is wrestling with a number of challenges including a revolving door of CEOs and weak sales. In May, it announced it had terminated its new CEO Ashley Buchanan after an investigation determined that he directed the retailer to engage in vendor transactions that involved undisclosed conflicts of interest. Kohl’s named Chairman Michael Bender as interim CEO as it searches for a replacement. Buchanan’s appointment marked the third CEO for Kohl’s in three years as the department store struggles to reverse sluggish sales. Its middle income shoppers have pulled back on discretionary spending in the face of still-high prices for necessities. It’s also faced stiff competition from Walmart and Amazon, which have been improving their fashion offerings at affordable prices. Now, like many retailers, it’s facing higher costs from President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Opendoor shares are up 28% this week after nearly tripling last week. Overall, they are up more than fivefold in July, closing at $2.88 per share Tuesday. That's still far below their peak of $35.88 in early 2021. The stock's recent gains come as hedge fund manager Eric Jackson touts the stock on X, formerly known as Twitter. On July 14, he said his hedge fund, EMJ Capital, took a position in Opendoor and expects growth over the next few years. The real estate services company, which also buys and flips homes, has yet to notch an annual profit. Analysts polled by FactSet expect it to continue posting losses in 2025 and 2026. The company faces a tough housing market. Soaring interest rates and a low supply of homes on the market have made it difficult for homebuyers. Those same factors have also made it less likely for current homeowners to sell their homes, especially those with lower interest rates. The original meme stock is video game retailer GameStop. In 2021, the company was struggling to survive amid the switch from discs to digital downloads and major investors were betting against the company. Investor Keith Gill, better known as “Roaring Kitty,” rallied other investors to join him in buying up thousands of GameStop shares, changing the trajectory of the stock. GameStop had been trading under $5 heading into 2021. The stock closed at $24.26 on Tuesday. The initial meme stock craze eventually fizzled out. But the frenzy occasionally reignites, as seen the past few years with sudden gains for BlackBerry, Bed, Bath & Beyond, and Chewy. Investors who buy now are betting that the momentum will continue, but it can shift suddenly. It took just four weeks in 2021 for GameStop’s stock to go from less than $5 to more than $120. But it has yet to touch that price again. Blackberry quickly jumped from less than $7 to nearly $30 in early 2021, but the gains were shaky and trimmed back within a year. It is now trading at about $4. ___ AP Business Writer Anne D'Innocenzio contributed to this report. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

Steel Dynamics Stock Steady on Long-Term Prospects,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/steel-dynamics-stock-steady-on-long-term-prospects/,"Steel Dynamics Inc. NASDAQ: STLD is holding on to slim gains after it reported its second quarter 2025 earnings after the market closed on July 21. The pullback comes after a gain of nearly 3% after the earnings report. The post-earnings gain was consistent with other basic materials stocks that had a strong opening to the week. This was particularly true of domestic steel producers like Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. NYSE: CLF and United States Steel Co. NYSE: X, which are also moving higher. Steel Dynamics reported slight misses on the top and bottom lines. Revenue of $4.57 billion missed expectations for $4.82 billion. However, it was up from the $4.37 billion it reported in the prior quarter and only down by about 1% year-over-year (YOY). Earnings per share (EPS) of $2.01 were about 21% lighter than analysts’ forecasts for $2.56 per share and were down 26% YOY. However, investors seem to be looking beyond the current print and believe in the company’s optimism about what comes next. That means expanding economic activity that will benefit U.S. steel production. For now, that also means looking beyond increased operating costs as Steel Dynamics expands its operations in anticipation of renewed activity. The company recently completed a new steel plant in Texas and is ramping up plant activity at its $2.7 billion aluminum plant in Mississippi. The Trump administration's tariffs on foreign steel are expected to make U.S. steel manufacturers like Steel Dynamics and Cleveland-Cliffs more attractive. Steel Dynamics' core competency in flat-rolled steel is expected to be a winner, as flat and long steel products are essential to refurbishing bridges and highways. However, as Steel Dynamics reported, the tariffs could create economic activity barriers. That was the case in the current quarter with the company citing the administration’s tariff policy as a reason for the double miss. The key issue for investors will be whether they believe this is a transitory issue. Two areas in the company’s report support that positive outlook. The company’s steel fabrication business was down by approximately 50% year over year and 20% from the prior quarter. However, the report also pointed to a backlog that is up 15% extending into 2026. The same may be true of aluminum production. Steel Dynamics expects to achieve 40%-50% utilization by the end of 2025, with an acceleration to 75% in 2026. Supporting this ramp-up is the company’s focus on can sheet, a less cyclical product. The company also has significant exposure to the auto industry, but that will depend on auto tariffs remaining at 25%. In 2025, STLD stock has been in a consolidation pattern. The low was hit in April, which corresponded with maximum tariff fears. The stock has recovered since then, but after a mixed report, investors may have to wait another quarter or two before getting a definitive move higher. For the better part of the year, the stock price has been trading above its 50-day simple moving average. If it can hold above that level, investors will be more likely to believe in a move higher. The MACD also appears ready for a bullish reversal.  But investors should wait for confirmation of that move. Current analyst sentiment has a consensus price target of $149.33, a 12% increase from its current price. The year-to-date gain of 17% in STLD stock and a dividend with a 1.5% yield means the stock may be closer to hitting its three-year average total return of around 33%.

What to know about soda sweeteners as sugar returns to American Coke,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/sweetening-soft-drinks-what-to-know-about-sugar-high-fructose-corn-syrup-and-their-alternatives-2025-07-22/,"President Donald Trump teased the announcement last week, but the Coca-Cola Co. confirmed it Tuesday: a cane sugar-sweetened version of the beverage maker's trademark soda will be released in the U.S. this fall. For decades, Coke and the makers of other soft drinks have generally used high fructose corn syrup or artificial sweeteners in their products manufactured in the U.S. But American consumers are increasingly looking for food and drinks with fewer and more natural ingredients, and beverage companies are responding. PepsiCo and Dr Pepper have sold versions of their flagship sodas sweetened with cane sugar since 2009. Coca-Cola has sold Mexican Coke — which uses cane sugar — in the U.S. since 2005, but it's positioned a trendy alternative and sold in glass bottles. Coke with cane sugar will likely be more widely available. Here are some frequently asked questions about the sweeteners in U.S. sodas: Many consumers know that consuming too many sweets can negatively affect their health, but soda drinkers sometimes debate if either cane sugar or high fructose corn syrup is better (or worse) than the other. The short answer is that it doesn’t make a difference, said Marion Nestle, one of the nation’s top nutrition experts and professor emeritus at New York University. High fructose corn syrup is made of the simple sugars glucose and fructose in liquid form. Cane sugar, also known as sucrose, is made of glucose and fructose bonded, but quickly split, Nestle explained. Both are still sugars, with about the same amount of calories. Whether a can of Coca-Cola contains one or the other, it will still be a sugary drink with about the same amount of calories and the same potential to increase well-documented health problems from obesity and diabetes to tooth decay. High fructose corn syrup costs less. According to price data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the wholesale price of HFCS-55, the type of corn syrup most commonly used in beverages, averaged 49.4 cents per pound last year. The average wholesale price of refined cane sugar was 60.1 cents per pound, while the average wholesale price of refined beet sugar was 51.7 cents per pound. But high fructose corn syrup has advantages beyond price. According to a 2008 paper in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, high fructose corn syrup is more stable than sugar when added to acidic beverages, and it can be pumped directly from delivery trucks into storage and mixing tanks. Tariffs are one reason. The U.S. has had barriers on sugar imports almost back to its founding; the first went into place in 1789, according to the Cato Institute, a think tank that advocates free markets. Since the passage of the Farm Bill in 1981, the U.S. has had a system in place that raises duties on sugar once a certain amount has been imported. The U.S. also has domestic production controls that limit supplies, keeping prices higher. But high fructose corn syrup is also cheaper because of the federal government’s billions of dollars in subsidies for corn farmers. Loans, direct payments, insurance premium subsidies and surplus crop purchases all lower farmers’ costs – and the price of the corn they grow. While cutting back on added sugars has documented benefits, replacing them with artificial sweeteners is complicated, too. Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, introduced in 2017, uses the artificial sweetener aspartame and the natural sweetener stevia in its recipe. But research suggests that aspartame may be linked to cancer. In 2023, a committee for the World Health Organization determined that aspartame should be categorized “as possibly carcinogenic to humans.” While that doesn’t mean that diet soda causes cancer, the scientific committee concluded that there may be a possible link between aspartame and liver cancer, and that the issue should be studied further. The U.S. Food and Drug administration disagreed with the WHO panel, citing “significant shortcomings” in the research that backed the conclusion. FDA officials noted that aspartame is one of the most studied food additives and said “FDA scientists do not have safety concerns” when it is used under approved conditions. Stevia, a plant-based sweetener, appears to be “a safe choice,” according to the Center for Science in the Public Interest, an advocacy group. ___ Durbin reported from Detroit.

OpenAI's Sam Altman warns of AI voice fraud crisis in banking,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/openais-sam-altman-warns-of-ai-voice-fraud-crisis-in-banking-2025-07-22/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — OpenAI CEO Sam Altman warned the financial industry of a “significant impending fraud crisis” because of the ability of artificial intelligence tools to impersonate a person's voice to bypass security checks and move money. Altman spoke at a Federal Reserve conference Tuesday in Washington. “A thing that terrifies me is apparently there are still some financial institutions that will accept the voiceprint as authentication,” Altman said. “That is a crazy thing to still be doing. AI has fully defeated that.” Voiceprinting as an identification for wealthy bank clients grew popular more than a decade ago, with customers typically asked to utter a challenge phrase into the phone to access their accounts. But now AI voice clones, and eventually video clones, can impersonate people in a way that Altman said is increasingly “indistinguishable from reality” and will require new methods for verification. “That might be something we can think about partnering on,” said Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman, the central bank’s top financial regulator, who was hosting the discussion with Altman.

Billionaire owner of the Los Angeles Times says he will take the newspaper public in the coming year,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/billionaire-owner-of-the-los-angeles-times-says-he-will-take-the-newspaper-public-in-the-coming-year-2025-07-22/,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, the billionaire owner of the Los Angeles Times since 2018, said this week that he intends to take the newspaper public in the coming year. During an interview on Monday’s “The Daily Show With Jon Stewart,” Soon-Shiong said the move would allow the Times “to be democratized and allow the public to have ownership of this paper.” Soon-Shiong said he's working with “an organization that’s putting that together right now.” He didn't identify the organization or say whether the deal would involve an initial public offer to sell shares of the company or another investment arrangement. “Whether you’re right, left, Democrat, Republican, you’re an American. So the opportunity for us to provide a paper that is the voices of the people, truly the voices of the people, is important,” he said. Soon-Shiong, a biotech billionaire, acquired the Times as part of a $500 million deal, returning it to local ownership two decades after the Chandler family sold it to Tribune Co. Soon-Shiong's purchase raised hopes after years of cutbacks, circulation declines and leadership changes. But like much of the media industry, the Times has continued to face financial difficulties, losing money and subscribers. Last year the company said it would lay off at least 115 employees — more than 20% of the newsroom — in one of the largest staff cuts in the newspaper’s history. At the time, the news organization said it had fallen well short of its digital subscriber goals and needed a revenue boost to sustain the newsroom and its digital operations. In January 2024, executive editor Kevin Merida suddenly stepped down after a 2 1/2-year tenure at the newspaper that spanned the coronavirus pandemic and three Pulitzer Prizes, as well as a period of layoffs and contentious contract negotiations. Then in October, the editorials editor resigned after Soon-Shiong blocked the editorial board’s plans to endorse Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris for president. Mariel Garza told the Columbia Journalism Review in an interview that she quit because the Times was remaining silent on the contest in “dangerous times.” Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

Puerto Rico's government sues private power company as chronic outages damage appliances,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/puerto-ricos-government-sues-private-power-company-as-chronic-outages-damage-appliances-2025-07-22/,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Puerto Rico’s government filed a lawsuit Tuesday against a private power company, claiming it is responsible for damages to customers' appliances caused by chronic power outages in the U.S. territory. The civil lawsuit by the consumer affairs department says the Luma company, which oversees power transmission and distribution in Puerto Rico, was “negligent” and is responsible for damages caused to consumer appliances by outages and power fluctuations. It said the department has the authority to take cases to court to protect those affected by the company’s “inefficiency and lack of adequate service.” The action was filed against the company as a whole since the law exempts Luma’s employees and contractors from claims filed by customers under an immunity granted in 2021 by Puerto Rico’s Energy Bureau. The suit cited a recent Luma statement at a public hearing that the company has rejected 1,828 claims. “It’s time for Luma to be fully accountable to Puerto Rican consumers,” it said. Luma said in a brief statement that it would treat the lawsuit with the seriousness and responsibility it deserves. “Our commitment is to continue working for the benefit of our customers, despite the significant challenges we face in operating a fragile and deteriorating electrical system, which for years has lacked the necessary maintenance and investment,” it said. The outages have damaged thousands of appliances ranging from air conditioners to refrigerators on the island of 3.2 million people with a 40% poverty rate. The lawsuit comes months after Puerto Rico’s governor promised to cancel Luma’s contract, warning it would be a long and complex process. Anger against Luma has been growing ever since it signed a contract with Puerto Rico’s government in 2020. Outages remain common after Hurricane Maria razed Puerto Rico’s electric grid when it hit the island as a powerful Category 4 storm in September 2017. But the grid was already frail following a lack of investment and maintenance for decades by Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority, which is struggling to restructure $9 billion in debt. Two island-wide blackouts hit the island in recent months, including on New Year’s Eve and during Easter Week. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

A Bullish Storm Is Brewing for High-Yield Verizon’s Share Price,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/a-bullish-storm-is-brewing-for-high-yield-verizons-share-price/,"Numerous factors, including Verizon’s NYSE: VZ valuation, yield, business traction, and analysts' sentiment, are aligning, setting the stock price up for a significant advance. Verizon’s 5G networks are gaining traction with consumers and businesses, revenue is growing, cash flow is improving, and the capital return is increasing annually. The critical factors are cash flow, free cash flow, and capital return. Verizon is a deep-value, high-yield stock that yielded more than 6% as of late July. It is on track for inclusion in the Dividend Aristocrats Index within a handful of years. The highlight from Q2 is that margins improved throughout the report for this telecom company. The company’s EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), adjusted EBITDA, earnings, cash flow, and free cash flow all improved compared to last year and at an accelerated pace relative to revenue. The net result is that the company improved its balance sheet condition in the first half while paying the dividend, and improvements are expected to continue as the year progresses. The balance sheet reflects reduced cash and assets at the end of Q2, offset by a more significant reduction in liabilities, improved leverage, and a 4% increase in equity. Price action following the report is bullish. The market advanced nearly 5% at the close of the session, indicating support at a critical level and a high likelihood of advancing. Bullish signals include a spike in trading volume, an advance from the six-day EMA, a bullish crossover in the stochastic, and an almost-crossover in the MACD. The crossovers are particularly telling; assuming MACD completes its crossover, the pair will form a strong signal, with both lows in their respective ranges, indicating a move to the top of the long-term range is likely.  Verizon had a solid Q2 with revenue growing by 5% and outpacing the consensus estimate by 235 basis points. The strength was driven by all segments, with gains in the core wireless segment led by equipment. Equipment sales topped 25% year-over-year growth, offset by a smaller 2.2% in services. Net additions were good across the network. FIOS continues to gain traction and is on track to reach its goals. The only bad news is that the net additions are slowing. However, sustained growth, better-than-expected quarterly numbers, and increased market share offset the slowdown. The margin news is good. The company has been working on its operational quality for years, and the tailwind was amplified by favorable tax news. The takeaway is that earnings and free cash flow are growing faster than the pace of capital return growth, which has been approximately 2% over the past three to five years. The company is well-positioned to continue paying its distribution and sustaining the growth pace well into the next decade, likely for longer. Guidance is another factor expected to propel this market higher in the second half of 2025. The company raised its outlook for margin and earnings, positioning the midpoint above MarketBeat’s reported consensus. Based on the trends and expected surge in IoT growth predicted for this year, the company may outperform this target. The growth of the IoT will be underpinned by AI and the proliferation of AI-enabled applications, particularly among businesses. The analysts' trends were robustly bullish leading up to the Q2 release and are likely to remain so in Q3. They include increasing coverage, firming sentiment with the Moderate Buy rating edging toward an outright Buy, and an uptrend in the price target. The consensus price target is of interest because it was $47 in late July, sufficient to match recent highs, and the trend suggests a move into the high-end range. Recent revisions put this market in the mid-$50 range, a 30% increase and a three-year high when reached. Before you consider Verizon Communications, you'll want to hear this.

Palantir Bulls and Bears Set for an August Showdown,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/palantir-bulls-and-bears-set-for-an-august-showdown/,"Palantir Technologies Inc. NASDAQ: PLTR continues to exceed expectations. As of July 21, the stock was up 102% in 2025. Perhaps more impressively, PLTR stock is up more than 68% after a pullback of approximately 40% between mid-February and early April. The next significant catalyst for Palantir may come from its earnings report, which is scheduled for August 4. The company has a history of beating revenue expectations, and is now solidly profitable. The question is whether it can live up to investors’ elevated expectations. Even if Palantir delivers blowout earnings, many investors find it hard to see past its lofty valuation, even in a pricey tech sector. PLTR stock is trading at around 665x earnings and 126x sales. Even for a company with a healthy balance sheet, many investors aren’t buying into future growth that will depend on flawless execution and exponential growth. Palantir stock sits at the intersection of bullish momentum and valuation anxiety. The deciding factor likely comes down to who’s buying PLTR stock, and the answer may be a surprise. Palantir bulls will say don’t fight the chart, and they have a case. Since hitting its low in April, the PLTR stock chart shows a classic bullish pattern of higher highs. The stock also continues to find support above its 50-day simple moving average (SMA), confirming plenty of willing buyers. Adding to the bullish case is that even with overall volume being down due to seasonal factors, the stock’s green (i.e., positive) days are supported by solid volume. Skeptics could point to the relative strength indicator (RSI), which is between 60 and 70. However, since the stock’s recent run, the RSI has been moving in a range that suggests neither overbought nor oversold conditions, which adds further support to the idea that the stock isn’t breaking down from a technical perspective. The Palantir options chain for August 8 contradicts the current sentiment of retail and institutional investors. That’s approximately one week after the company reports earnings on August 4. Traders are showing increased interest in near-the-money puts, while call volume fades at higher strike prices. At the same time, implied volatility is beginning to cool, suggesting expectations for explosive upside are waning. This activity implies that options traders see Palantir’s recent rally as potentially losing steam and are positioning for a period of consolidation or downside in the near term.  Palantir shareholders will remember that PLTR stock has been added to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq-100 in the last nine months. This is more than just a symbolic designation. Inclusion in those indexes means that Palantir stock is rising because of an influx of capital into passively managed funds and AI-focused ETFs. This these automatic purchases are likely a key reason for Palantir stock's increase. They are driven by the company’s expanding market capitalization and AI sector position, rather than its fundamentals. Importantly, this contradicts the narrative that PLTR stock is a meme stock being mindlessly driven higher by retail investors. But fund investors understand that money can flow out of funds as quickly as it came in. That's why Palantir’s upcoming earnings report will continue to draw interest from investors. PLTR stock is priced for perfection, and then some. If the company doesn’t deliver a blowout report, it could give fund investors a reason to trim their positions. If that does happen, it’s not a reflection of the company's value but merely a healthy pullback that could set investors up for higher highs in the future. That’s the growing sentiment among analysts, such as Dan Ives of Wedbush, who has set a $160 price target for PLTR stock. Before you consider Palantir Technologies, you'll want to hear this.

Thousands gather to protest as Zelenskyy signs bill weakening anti-corruption agencies,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/ukraines-parliament-passes-bill-weakening-anti-corruption-agencies-the-public-is-furious-2025-07-22/,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Thousands of people gathered in Kyiv and other cities across Ukraine on Tuesday to urge the president to veto a controversial bill that threatens anti-corruption infrastructure. It marked the first major rally against the government in more than three years of war. Ukraine ’s parliament passed legislation that will tighten oversight of two key anti-corruption agencies, which critics say could significantly weaken their independence and give President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s circle greater sway over investigations. Zelenskyy signed the bill into law, according to the parliament's website late Tuesday. Fighting entrenched corruption is crucial for Ukraine's bid to join the European Union and maintain access to billions of dollars in Western aid. The legislation's passage has triggered public outrage in Ukraine, with some saying it appeared to be a greater moral blow than the routine Russian drone and missile attacks. The changes would grant the prosecutor general new authority over investigations and cases handled by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SAPO). “In effect, if this bill becomes law, the head of SAPO will become a nominal figure, while NABU will lose its independence and turn into a subdivision of the prosecutor general’s office,” the agencies said in a joint statement on Telegram. In a post on X, the EU's Enlargement Commissioner Marta Kos expressed concern over the vote in the parliament, called the Rada, calling it “a serious step back.” Kos added: “Independent bodies like NABU & SAPO are essential for Ukraine’s EU path. Rule of Law remains in the very center of EU accession negotiations."" While rallies have taken place during the war in Ukraine, they have largely focused on the return of prisoners of war or missing people. Protests, however, remain a traditional form of public pressure in Ukraine, where two previous revolutions were victorious for the public. “Corruption is a problem in any country, and it must always be fought,” said Ihor Lachenkov, a blogger and activist who urged people to join the protest through his social media platforms, which reach more than 1.5 million followers. “Ukraine has far fewer resources than Russia in this war,"" he said. ""If we misuse them, or worse, allow them to end up in the pockets of thieves, our chances of victory diminish. All our resources must go toward the fight.” The Ukrainian branch of Transparency International criticized parliament’s decision, saying it undermines one of the most significant reforms since what Ukraine calls its Revolution of Dignity in 2014 and damages trust with international partners. The group urged Zelenskyy to veto the law, warning that otherwise he would share responsibility with the Rada for ""dismantling Ukraine’s anti-corruption infrastructure.” Many protesters carried signs reading “Veto the law,” “Protect the anti-corruption system, protect Ukraine’s future,” or simply “We are against it.” The mood of anger and frustration among the war-weary Ukrainians prevailed in the crowd. Some protesters accused Ukraine’s leadership of prioritizing loyalty and personal connections over the fight against corruption. “Those who swore to protect the laws and the Constitution have instead chosen to shield their inner circle, even at the expense of Ukrainian democracy,” said veteran Oleh Symoroz, sitting in a wheelchair because both his legs were amputated after he was wounded in 2022. “Instead of setting an example of zero tolerance for corruption, the president is using his power to take control of criminal cases involving his allies,” he said. On Monday, Ukraine’s domestic security agency detained two NABU officials on suspicion of links to Russia and searched other agency employees on unrelated allegations. Zelenskyy's office didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Colbert jokes about 'cancel culture' and has a very pointed message for Trump,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/colbert-jokes-about-cancel-culture-and-has-a-very-pointed-message-for-president-donald-trump-2025-07-22/,"Stephen Colbert returned for his first full program after last week's announcement that CBS was canceling his “Late Show” with some supportive late-night guests, a joke about cancel culture and an extremely pointed remark directed at President Donald Trump. “I'm going to go ahead and say it: Cancel culture's gone way too far,” Colbert said to a rambunctious audience that loudly chanted his name. CBS and parent Paramount Global said the decision to end the “Late Show” next May was purely financial. It hasn't gone unnoticed — and was mentioned by Colbert Monday night — that the announcement came days after the comic had sharply criticized Paramount's $16 million settlement of Trump's lawsuit over a “60 Minutes” interview. Colbert, known for his sharp comic takedowns of the Republican president, said that “over the weekend, it sunk in that they killed off our show. But they made one mistake. They left me alive.” Now, he said, “I can say what I really think of Donald Trump, starting right now.” As his audience cheered him on, Colbert said, “I don't care for him. Doesn't seem to have the skill set to be president.” He read a passage from a Trump social media message saying that he loved that the “untalented” Colbert had been fired. “How dare you, sir,” Colbert said. “Would an untalented man be able to compose the following satirical witticism?” The show switched to a close-up camera where Colbert appeared to say, “f—- you,” the word bleeped out and his mouth blurred. Noting CBS' explanation for his firing, Colbert said, “how can it purely be a financial decision if the show is No. 1 in the ratings? It's confusing. A lot of folks are asking that question, mainly my staff's parents and spouses.” With some apparent irritation, he said some news stories over the weekend reported the apparently leaked information that “Late Show” was losing between $40 million and $50 million a year. Ad revenue for late-night entertainment broadcasts has shrunk sharply as the audience, particularly young men, turn to streaming or other priorities. “I could see us losing $24 million,” Colbert said. “But where would Paramount have ever spent the other $16 million? Oh, yeah.” Colbert introduced the odd duo of “Weird Al” Yankovic and Lin-Manuel Miranda to sing Coldplay's “Viva La Vida.” In a sly reference to the couple caught on camera last week at a Coldplay concert, “Late Show” cameras panned the audience to find some supportive friends — fellow late-night hosts Jimmy Fallon, Seth Meyers, Jon Stewart and John Oliver, as well as Adam Sandler, Anderson Cooper and Andy Cohen. On Comedy Central's “The Daily Show,"" also owned by Paramount, Stewart delivered an impassioned defense of his friend and former co-worker and suggested it was futile to try to satisfy Trump, certainly not by taking away programs that have helped build the company's value over the years. “This is not the moment to give in,” Stewart said. “I'm not giving in. I'm not going anywhere. I think.” On his own show, Colbert turned serious — briefly — to address people who had expressed support for him since the announcement was made. “Some people see this show going away as the sign of something truly dire. And while I'm a big fan of me, I don't necessarily agree with that statement,” he said, ""because we here at the ‘Late Show’ never saw our job as changing anything other than how you felt at the end of the day, which I think is a worthy goal. “Or,” he continued, “changing how you felt the next morning when you watched on your phone, which is why broadcast TV is dying.” ___ David Bauder writes about the intersection of media and entertainment for the AP.

Cutting edge: Jets unveil a renovated locker room that includes 92 new lockers and a barbershop,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/cutting-edge-jets-unveil-a-renovated-locker-room-that-includes-92-new-lockers-and-a-barbershop-2025-07-22/,"FLORHAM PARK, N.J. (AP) — The new-look New York Jets underwent an Extreme Makeover: Locker Room Edition during the offseason. Players such as star wide receiver Garrett Wilson, cornerback Sauce Gardner and new quarterback Justin Fields reported for the team's training camp Tuesday and arrived at the Jets' facility to a fully renovated locker room with some state-of-the-art upgrades. In a release on its website, which also included a drone-footage tour, the team announced that it added 92 customized lockers along with several other amenities, including a barbershop, a larger sauna and a brightly lit 2,000-pound 3D Jets ceiling logo in the middle of the locker room. “It's like you're in a whole new area,” defensive tackle Quinnen Williams said. “Like when you, I guess, renovate your house and you walk into your house for the first time. It's unbelievable. I've been here six years and then this year, I get a new locker room.” The upgrades, which the team said had been in the works for a few years, came after a players poll released by the NFL Players Association in February gave the Jets a D-plus for their locker room, ranking 26th in the league. The team moved into its current facility in 2008. Woody Johnson received an F and was the lowest-ranked owner. The team received an overall ranking of 29th. “We take pride in having a first-class environment for the players,"" Robert Mastroddi, the Jets’ senior vice president of security and facility operations, told the team’s website. ""These upgrades will certainly provide more comfort, but they also will help with wellness, efficiency and ultimately performance. There is a commitment to winning and that’s where this all derived from.” The Jets, who have the NFL's longest active playoff drought at 14 seasons, have a new general manager in Darren Mougey and head coach in Aaron Glenn. The two revamped the roster this offseason by infusing more youth — moves that included releasing veterans such as Aaron Rodgers, Davante Adams, C.J. Mosley, Greg Zuerlein and Thomas Morstead. The new lockers, designed by the Texas-based Longhorn Locker Company, have fully automated video screens — the Jets say they're the first pro or college team to have them — that include the players' headshots, names, hometowns and colleges. “It's super dope,” a smiling Williams said. “The new chairs are really comfortable and nice.” There also are three separate fans inside the lockers to dry their helmets, shoulder pads and cleats in an effort to reduce moisture and lower risks of staph infections. Mastroddi said the Jets are also the first team to have an on-site barbershop that includes two vintage barber chairs. “We want to make it comfortable, keep players in the building because they want to be there,"" Mastroddi said. ""We’re offering them all the amenities that they would have to go outside to get.” ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.
