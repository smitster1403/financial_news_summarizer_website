New tax break for auto loans could save some buyers thousands of dollars. But will it boost sales?,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/new-tax-break-for-auto-loans-could-save-some-buyers-thousands-of-dollars-but-will-it-boost-sales-2025-07-12/,"Millions of people receive a federal tax deduction for the interest they pay on home loans. Under President Donald Trump’s new tax-cut law, many people for the first time also could claim a tax deduction for interest on their vehicle loans. The new tax break will be available even to people who don't itemize deductions. But there are some caveats that could limit its reach. The vehicles must be new, not used. They must be assembled in the U.S. And the loans must be issued no sooner than this year, to list just a few qualifications. Here are some things to know about the new auto loan interest tax deduction: Trump pledged while campaigning last year to make interest on car loans tax-deductible. He said it would make car ownership more affordable and “stimulate massive domestic auto production.” The idea made it into the big tax-cut bill passed by Congress, which Trump signed into law July 4. The law allows taxpayers to deduct up to $10,000 of interest payments annually on loans for new American-made vehicles from 2025 through 2028. It applies to cars, motorcycles, sport utility vehicles, minivans, vans and pickup trucks weighing less than 14,000 pounds, a threshold referred to as light vehicles. But it only applies to vehicles purchased for personal use, not for fleets or commercial purposes. The tax break can be claimed starting on 2025 income tax returns. But the deduction phases out for individuals with incomes between $100,000 and $150,000 or joint taxpayers with incomes between $200,000 and $250,000. Those earning more cannot claim the tax break. U.S. automobile dealers sold 15.9 million new light vehicles last year, a little over half of which were assembled in the U.S, according to Cox Automotive. It says around 60% of retail sales are financed with loans. After excluding fleet and commercial vehicles and customers above the income cutoff, an estimated 3.5 million new vehicle loans could be eligible for the tax break this year, if purchasing patterns stay the same, said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive. The tax break applies to vehicles assembled in the U.S., no matter where the company making them is headquartered. All Tesla vehicles sold in the U.S. are assembled in this country. But so are all Acura brands, the luxury model of Japanese automaker Honda. Last year, 78% of Ford vehicles sold in the U.S. were assembled in this country, according to Cox Automotive. But customers wanting the tax break will need to pay attention to specific models. While the Ford Mustang is assembled in Michigan, the Mustang Mach-E is built in Mexico. General Motors assembles all of its Cadillacs in the U.S. But just 44% of its Chevrolets sold last year were assembled in the U.S., and just 14% of Buicks, according to Cox Automotive. That's a lower U.S-assembled rate than Honda (60%), Toyota (52%) and Nissan (48%), which all are headquartered in Japan. The average new vehicle loan is about $44,000 financed over six years. Interest rates vary by customer, so the savings will, too. In general, the tax deduction will decline after the initial year, because interest payments on loans are frontloaded while principal payments grow on the back end. At a 9.3% interest rate, an average new vehicle buyer could save about $2,200 on taxes over four years, Smoke said. The tax savings would be less on a loan at 6.5%, which is the rate figured into calculations by the American Financial Services Association, a consumer credit industry trade group. Whereas the tax deduction for home loan interest can be claimed only by people itemizing on their tax returns, Congress wrote the deduction for auto loan interest so that it can apply to all taxpayers, including those claiming the standard deduction. On a tax form, the auto loan deduction will come before the calculation of a taxpayer's adjusted gross income. That's an important distinction, because many states use a taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income as the starting point for figuring their state income taxes. If that income figure is lower, it could reduce the state taxes owed. At Bowen Scarff Ford in Kent, Washington, customers started asking about the auto loan tax deduction before Congress had even taken a final vote on the tax-cut bill, said General Manager Paul Ray. So he decided to promote it on the dealer's website. A website ribbon exclaims: “CAR LOAN TAX DEDUCTION NOW AVAILABLE"" while also promoting an electric vehicle tax credit that is ending soon as a result of Trump's tax-cut law. “I think it’s going to help incentivize vehicle purchases through this year,"" Ray said. Celia Winslow, president and CEO of the American Financial Services Association, concurred: “For some people deciding — should I buy it, should I not — this could be something that tips the scale.” Others remain skeptical. According to Smoke's math, the average annual tax savings is smaller than a single month's loan payment for a new vehicle. “I don’t think it moves the needle on somebody on the fence of buying a new vehicle or not,"" Smoke said. ""But I think it could influence their decision to finance that vehicle instead of paying cash or instead of leasing a vehicle.” Before you consider General Motors, you'll want to hear this.

Leaders of Azerbaijan and Syria discuss energy cooperation as they rebuild ties,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/azerbaijan-and-syria-discuss-energy-cooperation-as-they-rebuild-ties-2025-07-12/,"The leaders of Azerbaijan and Syria on Saturday pledged to deepen their cooperation particularly in the energy sector, as they moved to revitalize the ties that had been strained under former Syrian President Bashar Assad. Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev expressed hope that the visit to Baku by Syria's interim Ahmad Al-Sharaa, whose rebel forces toppled Assad in December, would “significantly contribute to the development of bilateral relations.” Al-Sharaa thanked Aliyev for Azerbaijan’s “brotherly support to Syria” and said that Assad's government had harmed relations with many countries, including Azerbaijan, according to the Azerbaijan president's press service. The leaders also highlighted plans to to export Azerbaijani gas to Syria via Turkey and Azerbaijan’s potential role in rebuilding Syria’s energy infrastructure, it said. The new authorities in Damascus have strong relations with Turkey, Azerbaijan’s close ally. Baku — which also has close relations with Israel — has in recent months served as an intermediary to diffuse growing tensions between Turkey and Israel in the Syrian arena. In April, Turkey and Israel held “technical talks” in Azerbaijan to establish a “de-escalation mechanism to prevent undesirable incidents in Syria.” Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

Power Solutions International Poised for 75% Upside,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/power-solutions-international-poised-for-75-upside/,"If you have wondered whether Power Solutions International’s NASDAQ: PSIX stock rally is played out or has room to run, the charts say this market is strengthening and has room to run. A lot of room to run. The company's weekly chart is a textbook example of a bull market gaining strength. It shows the potential to rise by another 75% before reaching a significant top. Bullish signals include the price action, which is trending strongly higher, the MACD, which is robust and converging with the highs, and volume, which is also strong, rising, and converging with the highs. Together, they amount to a strong technical signal; the only problem is that the price is pulling back in mid-July.  However, some interesting possibilities emerge, assuming the market is entering a consolidation, potentially forming a triangle or flag pattern. The market will create a continuation pattern in that scenario and bring the full magnitude of its move into view. A bullish flag pattern is typically the middle or within the mid-range of a larger movement, which, in this case, could extend by an amount equal to the rally that preceded it. That’s a solid $60 movement, potentially putting this market at $140 by the end of this year. Power Solutions International is an outside-the-box AI play whose business is essential to the industry: power and power management. Its custom engines and power solutions are used for critical backup power supply, seamlessly integrated into the data center infrastructure. That is a vital element in an industry reliant on steady, reliable power, and PSIX doesn’t stop there. Power Solutions International also provides power management equipment and services, essential for the power-consuming data center industry. Other business drivers include its impact on end-user compliance requirements, such as environmental. PSIX solutions can be used with multiple fuel types, including natural gas, propane, and biofuel. It is also a diversified business model with operations spanning industrial, transportation, and power system markets. The critical takeaway is that Power Solutions International’s revenue growth accelerated under the influence of AI. The Q1 results revealed a 42.3% year-over-year (YOY) increase, which outperformed MarketBeat’s consensus by 2500 basis points and led management to provide strong guidance. The consensus is for revenue growth to continue sequentially, sustaining a high-double-digit YOY pace through the end of the year, and is likely too cautious. The consensus is expected to be low due to the low number of analysts covering the stock and the amount of revision activity in 2025. The analysts and institutional activity is tepid in 2025 but offers potential for increased activity. MarketBeat tracks a single analyst and reports less than 25% institutional ownership. The single analyst rates the stock as a Buy, with more Buy ratings expected. Institutions have been buying on balance in 2025, a trend likely to strengthen over the coming quarters. Unlike many small-cap tech stocks, this one makes money today. The company’s margins are not only positive in 2025 but are also widening under the influence of revenue leverage, operational improvement, and spending controls. Gross margin widened by 270 basis points in Q1, while SG&A grew much slower than revenue, resulting in net income increasing by nearly 170% and adjusted EPS just over eight cents, 37 cents higher than expected. Cash flow is also positive, allowing PSIX to reduce debt in Q1. The company’s cash position is also solid, leaving equity up roughly 30% and the business in a flexible financial position. Management aims to leverage the balance sheet, using debt to fund growth and drive value gains for shareholders. Before you consider Power Solutions International, you'll want to hear this.

Why Wall Street Is Betting on These 3 Comeback Stocks,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/why-wall-street-is-betting-on-these-3-comeback-stocks/,"The first half of 2025 was a tumultuous time for U.S. securities, to put it mildly. The transition to the second Trump administration brought rapidly shifting domestic and international policies and ever-changing tariffs to an economy that some analysts feel is on the brink of recession. Still, after a precipitous drop in early April, the S&P 500 recovered nicely in the second quarter. With gains of more than 6% for the first half of the year, the benchmark index is starting the third quarter at fresh record highs. That's not to say, however, that every security in the U.S. market has been successful at staging a recovery. Some prominent firms have significantly underperformed the broader market in the first half of 2025. Despite their recent troubles, however, three of these companies may present investors an opportunity to buy before share prices recover, capturing attractive returns in the process. Health insurance and services giant UnitedHealth Group Inc. NYSE: UNH had a dismal start to the year, with shares plummeting after top- and bottom-line misses on its first earnings report of 2025 and then falling further through May. Though still the top U.S. insurer by market value, UnitedHealth has shed more than 40% of its share price this year. The company's issues are many and varied: surging medical costs threaten its earnings performance, the departure of its CEO has disrupted stability, and an ongoing fraud investigation has done sizable reputational damage. Analysts forecast a year-over-year (YOY) dip of more than 20% for EPS in the company's second-quarter earnings report, although revenue may increase over the same period. All that being said, investors may also have reasons to expect a turnaround from one of Congress' favorite stocks to buy in recent weeks. UNH did recently boost its dividend and sell off a portion of its Latin American unit, Banmedica, both of which should appeal to shareholders hoping the company will provide a stronger value proposition. Further, the company's fundamental business model—diversified between healthcare services and insurance—has long been a winner. If UNH can find a catalyst to reintegrate stability, it could stage a turnaround and see 38% upside potential. Meanwhile, with a P/S ratio of just 0.7 and a trailing P/E ratio of 12.9, shares are valued as competitively as they've been in a long time. Southern California utility firm Edison International NYSE: EIX experienced notable volatility in the first half of the year, with a number of rises and falls in the first six months amid wildfires across the region. Entering the third quarter, though, shares are down more than 22%. Like other California utilities, Edison is facing the possibility of massive regulatory overhaul statewide thanks to SB 254. The bill would limit Edison's ability to raise prices and also stipulate that it, alongside other utility firms, would pay for fire mitigation and other additional costs. The risk of regulatory uncertainty is significant, particularly for Edison's short-term performance. Still, nine out of 15 analysts believe EIX shares are a Buy, and analysts are widely optimistic about the company's ability to boost its earnings by nearly 17% in the next year. The firm also has a strong dividend yield of 6.60%. Investors willing to wait out shifting regulations—or who suspect SB 254 may not be passed in its current form—might consider taking a chance on EIX while the P/S ratio is just 1.1. Customer relationship management (CRM) software leader Salesforce Inc. NYSE: CRM saw shares dwindle in price in the first months of the year, and they have so far not made a recovery. The share price has declined by 14% in the first half. Salesforce has successfully transitioned toward a model that prioritizes profitability, and its margins are improving. The company is drawing new business with its agentic AI offerings like Agentforce, even as its core products continue to sustain users from year to year. Quarterly data cloud and AI revenue recently more than doubled YOY. The company's first-quarter earnings report called for improved guidance, and this growth could accelerate through the end of the year. Add to that a modest dividend and aggressive share repurchases, and Salesforce appears to have found a recipe for building value. Before you consider UnitedHealth Group, you'll want to hear this.

"Trump announces 30% tariffs against EU, Mexico to begin Aug. 1, rattling major US trading partners",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-announces-30-tariffs-against-eu-mexico-to-begin-august-1-2025-07-12/,"BRIDGEWATER, N.J. (AP) — President Donald Trump on Saturday announced he's levying tariffs of 30% against the European Union and Mexico starting Aug. 1, a move that could cause massive upheaval between the United States and two of its biggest trade partners. Trump detailed the planned tariffs in letters posted to his social media account. They are part of an announcement blitz by Trump of new tariffs aimed at allies and foes alike, a bedrock of his 2024 campaign that he said would set the foundation for reviving a U.S. economy that he claims has been ripped off by other nations for decades. In his letter to Mexico's leader, President Claudia Sheinbaum, Trump acknowledged that the country has been helpful in stemming the flow of undocumented migrants and fentanyl into the United States. But he said the country has not done enough to stop North America from turning into a “Narco-Trafficking Playground.” “Mexico has been helping me secure the border, BUT, what Mexico has done, is not enough,” Trump added. Trump in his letter to the European Union said the U.S. trade deficit was a national security threat. “We have had years to discuss our Trading Relationship with The European Union, and we have concluded we must move away from these long-term, large, and persistent, Trade Deficits, engendered by your Tariff, and Non-Tariff, Policies, and Trade Barriers,” Trump wrote in the letter to the EU. “Our relationship has been, unfortunately, far from Reciprocal.” The letters come in the midst of an on-and-off Trump threat to impose tariffs on countries and right an imbalance in trade. Trump in April imposed tariffs on dozens of countries, before pausing them for 90 days to negotiate individual deals. As the three-month grace period ended this week, Trump began sending his tariff letters to leaders but again has pushed back the implementation day for what he says will be just a few more weeks. If he moves forward with the tariffs, it could have ramifications for nearly every aspect of the global economy. European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen responded by noting the bloc's “commitment to dialogue, stability, and a constructive transatlantic partnership.” “At the same time, we will take all necessary steps to safeguard EU interests, including the adoption of proportionate countermeasures if required,” von der Leyen said in a statement. Von der Leyen added that the EU remains committed to continuing negotiations with the U.S. and coming to an agreement before Aug. 1. Trade ministers from EU countries are scheduled to meet Monday to discuss trade relations with the U.S., as well as with China. European leaders joined von der Leyen in urging Trump to give negotiations more time and warnings of possible new tariffs on Washington. “With European unity, it is more than ever up to the Commission to assert the Union’s determination to resolutely defend European interests,” French President Emmanuel Macron said in a statement posted on X. Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni’s office said ""it would make no sense to trigger a trade war between the two sides of the Atlantic."" Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen told broadcaster DR that Trump was taking a “pointless and a very shortsighted approach."" Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson warned in an interview with SVT that “everyone loses out from an escalated trade conflict, and it will be U.S. consumers who pay the highest price.” Trump, as he has in previous letters, warned that his administration would further raise tariffs if the EU attempts to hike its own tariffs on the United States. The Mexican government said it was informed during high-level talks with U.S. State Department officials Friday that the Trump letter was coming. The delegation told Trump officials at the meeting it disagreed with the decision and considered it “unfair treatment,” according to a Mexican government statement. Sheinbaum, who has sought to avoid directly criticizing Trump in the early going of her presidency, expressed a measure of confidence during a public appearance on Saturday that the U.S. and Mexico will reach “better terms.” “I’ve always said that in these cases, you need a cool head to face any problem,” Sheinbaum said. With the reciprocal tariffs, Trump is effectively blowing up the rules governing world trade. For decades, the United States and most other countries abided by tariff rates set through a series of complex negotiations known as the Uruguay round. Countries could set their own tariffs, but under the “most favored nation’’ approach, they couldn’t charge one country more than they charged another. The Mexico tariff, if it goes into effect, could replace the 25% tariffs on Mexican goods that do not comply with the existing U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement. Trump’s letter did not address if USMCA-compliant goods would still be exempt from the Mexico tariffs after Aug. 1, as the White House said would be the case with Canada. Trump sent a letter to Canada earlier this week threatening a 35% tariff hike. With Saturday's letters, Trump has now issued tariff conditions on 24 countries and the 27-member European Union. So far, the tally of trade deals struck by Trump stands at two — one with the United Kingdom and one with Vietnam. Trump has also announced the framework for a deal with China, the details of which remain fuzzy. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Saturday said the U.K. “smartly” acted early. “Let this be a lesson to other countries - earnest, good faith negotiations can produce powerful results that benefit both sides of the table, while correcting the imbalances that plague global trade,” Bessent said in a posting on X. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former Congressional Budget Office director and president of the center-right American Action Forum, said the letters were evidence that serious trade talks were not taking place over the past three months. He stressed that nations were instead talking amongst themselves about how to minimize their own exposure to the U.S. economy and Trump. “They’re spending time talking to each other about what the future is going to look like, and we’re left out,” Holtz-Eakin said. If the tariffs do indeed take effect, the potential impact on Europe could be vast. The value of EU-U.S. trade in goods and services amounted to 1.7 trillion euros ($2 trillion) in 2024, or an average of 4.6 billion euros a day, according to EU statistics agency Eurostat. Europe’s biggest exports to the U.S. were pharmaceuticals, cars, aircraft, chemicals, medical instruments and wine and spirits. Lamberto Frescobaldi, president of the Union of Italian Wines trade association, said Trump's move could lead to “a virtual embargo” of his country's wine. “A single letter was enough to write the darkest chapter in relations between two historic Western allies,” Frescobaldi said. Trump has complained about the EU’s 198 billion-euro trade surplus in goods, which shows Americans buy more goods from European businesses than the other way around. However, American companies fill some of the gap by outselling the EU when it comes to services such as cloud computing, travel bookings, and legal and financial services. The U.S. services surplus took the nation’s trade deficit with the EU down to 50 billion euros ($59 billion), which represents less than 3% of overall U.S.-EU trade. ___ Associated Press writers Josh Boak in Washington, Angela Charlton in Paris, Regina Garcia Cano in Caracas, Venezuela, Kirsten Grieshaber in Berlin, Dave McHugh in Frankfurt, Germany, and Giada Zampano in Rome contributed to this report.

Smart Investors Are Watching These 3 Undervalued Stocks,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/smart-investors-are-watching-these-3-undervalued-stocks/,"Value stocks have been the most overlooked area of the stock market in today’s cycle, replaced by the popular growth stories that have captured investor attention (and capital) over the past year or so. However, a few key factors in market fundamentals may trigger a rotation back into value, or specifically undervalued stocks, over the coming months and quarters. With this in mind, investors can run a screening process to land their portfolios on the right side of the market, a screener that looks for high returns on capital (for future compounding benefits) and strong business models that can sustain economic cycles better than others. Finding this criterion, all investors need is a reasonable discount, whether in terms of price action or valuation multiples, to deliver the sort of upside everyone is looking for. Fitting this filtering process, names like Ulta Beauty Inc. NASDAQ: ULTA, Adobe Inc. NASDAQ: ADBE, and even Sprouts Farmers Market Inc. NASDAQ: SFM return the best profile. Not only are these names positioned in a low-cyclical space within their industry, which is reflected in their high profit metrics, but they also trade at valuations that create an asymmetric upside opportunity for investors today. Even though Ulta stock now trades near its 52-week high, other traditional valuation methods indicate how cheap this stock is today. Looking at the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for Ulta, which is currently 19.7x, investors can notice a significant discrepancy compared to historical levels. Ulta, as a business, hasn’t been this undervalued since the onset of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, despite today’s world being significantly different and better than it was back then. There are no lockdowns keeping customers from buying skincare and makeup products, and the company’s fundamentals have done nothing but keep pushing on. As one of the largest players in the consumer discretionary space, Ulta commands favorable pricing power dynamics, enabling its gross profit margins to reach as high as 42.7%. High margins are the building blocks of profitable businesses, the ones that compound investor capital year after year. One metric that can solidify this theme is the return on invested capital (ROIC) rate for Ulta’s business, which came in at an impressive 26.8% over the past 12 months. ROIC matters because, eventually, annual stock price performance tends to align with the long-term ROIC rate, and for Ulta, this has consistently been between 24% and 27%. This setup might explain why Michael Baker, an analyst at DA Davidson, decided to reiterate his Buy rating on Ulta stock. This time, he also placed a $550 per share price target on the company to call for an additional 16% upside from today’s price. Given where the forward P/E is today, chances are Ulta might not only meet but exceed this valuation target. Following in the same theme as Ulta, Adobe’s forward P/E of 17.1x is now the lowest it has been on record, and that simply cannot sit well with logical investors who understand that today’s economic landscape is nowhere near where it could be to justify such a low price on a company like Adobe. What makes Adobe great is that most of its revenue comes from subscription services, which provide a steady and predictable stream of cash flows. This allows management and analysts to manage and forecast financials accurately into the future; it also inherently reduces the volatility that investors might see in the stock price. Now that Adobe's price has fallen to only 64% of its 52-week high, the asymmetric nature of the company’s potential upside stands out, as it should. This will allow investors to enjoy a relatively smooth ride higher in the coming months and quarters. With this setup in mind, it shouldn’t be a surprise to see sentiment change for Adobe soon enough. In fact, Gil Luria from DA Davidson has placed a Buy rating on Adobe as of late June 2025, alongside a price target of up to $500 per share, which would command an upside potential of 34% from today’s price. Adobe’s ability to generate an ROIC of up to 36% should be enough to keep the stock compounding higher into the future. Although this stock has already delivered a massive rally of up to 100% over the past 12 months, it still has considerable potential to continue pushing higher. The reason for the additional upside lies in the company’s business itself, as part of the defensive and non-cyclical space that might become more attractive during a broader rotation into value. Sprouts Farmers Market sports a 15% ROIC, which puts it at the top of the peer group in terms of profitability, so the discounted multiples don’t, and shouldn’t, apply in this case. While the other names on this list operate in a space that could be a breeding ground for competition or diminishing returns, Sprouts has one of the oldest business models in place. Supermarket chains differ from technology stocks or retail because those that can lead in profitability tend to remain leaders for a long period. This is why this stock commands a premium valuation of 30.8x forward P/E over the rest of the peer group and even the S&P 500 index. It's all for good reason, and its recent price action justifies that view. Before you consider Ulta Beauty, you'll want to hear this.

"Osprey came back from the brink once. Now chicks are dying in nests, and some blame overfishing",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/osprey-came-back-from-the-brink-once-now-chicks-are-dying-in-nests-and-some-blame-overfishing-2025-07-12/,"GLOUCESTER POINT, Va. (AP) — Stepping onto an old wooden duck blind in the middle of the York River, Bryan Watts looks down at a circle of sticks and pine cones on the weathered, guano-spattered platform. It’s a failed osprey nest, taken over by diving terns. “The birds never laid here this year,” said Watts, near the mouth of Virginia’s Chesapeake Bay. “And that's a pattern we've been seeing these last couple of years.” Watts has a more intimate relationship with ospreys than most people have with a bird — he has climbed to their nests to free them from plastic bags, fed them by hand and monitored their eggs with telescopic mirrors. The fish-eating raptor known for gymnastic dives and whistle-like chirps is an American conservation success story. After pesticides and other hazards nearly eliminated the species from much of the country, the hawk-like bird rebounded after the banning of DDT in 1972 and now numbers in the thousands in the U.S. But Watts has documented an alarming trend. The birds, which breed in many parts of the U.S., are failing to successfully fledge enough chicks around their key population center of the Chesapeake Bay. The longtime biologist blames the decline of menhaden, a small schooling fish critical to the osprey diet. Without menhaden to eat, chicks are starving and dying in nests, Watts said. Watts's claim has put him and environmental groups at odds with the fishing industry, trade unions and sometimes government regulators. Menhaden is valuable for fish oil, fish meal and agricultural food as well as bait. U.S. fishermen have caught at least 1.1 billion pounds of menhaden every year since 1951. Members of the industry tout its sustainability and said the decline in osprey may have nothing to do with fishing. But without help, the osprey population could tumble to levels not seen since the dark days of DDT, said Watts, director of the Center for Conservation Biology at The College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia. “The osprey are yelling pretty loudly that, hey, there's not enough menhaden for us to reproduce successfully,” Watts said. “And we should be listening to them to be more informed fully on the fisheries side, and we should take precaution on the fisheries management side. But that hasn't won the day at this point.” Watts, who has studied osprey on the Chesapeake for decades, has backed his claims of population decline by publishing studies in scientific journals. He said it boils down to a simple statistic — to maintain population, osprey pairs need to average 1.15 chicks per year. Osprey were reproducing at that level in the 1980s, but today in some areas around the main stem of the Chesapeake, it's less than half of that, Watts said. In particularly distressed areas, they aren't even reproducing at one-tenth that level, he said. And the decline in available menhaden matches the areas of nesting failure, Watts said. Also called pogies or bunkers, the oily menhaden are especially important for young birds because they are more nutritious than other fish in the sea. Osprey “reproductive performance is inextricably linked to the availability and abundance” of menhaden, Watts wrote in a 2023 study published in Frontiers in Marine Science. Conservationists have been concerned for years, saying too many menhaden have been removed to maintain their crucial role in the ocean food chain. Historian H. Bruce Franklin went so far as to title his 2007 book on menhaden “The Most Important Fish In The Sea.” Menhaden help sustain one of the world's largest fisheries, worth more than $200 million at the docks in 2023. Used as bait, the fish are critical for valuable commercial targets such as Maine lobster. They're also beloved by sportfishermen. The modern industry is dominated by Omega Protein, a Reedville, Virginia, company that is a subsidiary of Canadian aquaculture giant Cooke. The harvesting of the menhaden is performed by an American company, Ocean Harvesters, which is based in Reedville and contracts with Omega, which handles processing. The companies pushed back at the idea that fishing is the cause of osprey decline, although they did acknowledge that fewer menhaden are showing up in some parts of the bay. Federal data show osprey breeding is in decline in many parts of the country, including where menhaden is not harvested at all, said Ben Landry, an Omega spokesperson. Climate change, pollution and development could be playing a role, said Landry and others with the company. Blaming fishing “just reeks of environmental special interest groups having an influence over the process,” Landry said. The menhaden fishery is managed by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, an interstate body that crafts rules and sets fishing quotas. Prompted by questions about ospreys, it created a work group to address precautionary management of the species in the Chesapeake Bay. In April, this group proposed several potential management approaches, including seasonal closures, restrictions on quotas or days at sea, and limitations on kinds of fishing gear. The process of creating new rules could begin this summer, said James Boyle, fishery management plan coordinator with the commission. The osprey population has indeed shown declines in some areas since 2012, but it's important to remember the bird's population is much larger than it was before DDT was banned, Boyle said. “There are big increases in osprey population since the DDT era,” Boyle said, citing federal data showing a six-fold increase in osprey populations along the Atlantic Coast since the 1960s. To a number of environmental groups, any decline is too much. This irritates some labor leaders who worry about losing more jobs as the fishing industry declines. Kenny Pinkard, retired vice president of UFCW Local 400's executive board and a longtime Virginia fishermen, said he feels the industry is being scapegoated. “There are some people who just don't want to see us in business at all,” he said. But Chris Moore, Virginia executive director for Chesapeake Bay Foundation, said the country risks losing an iconic bird if no action is taken. He said Watts's studies show that the osprey will fail without access to menhaden. “Osprey have been a success story,” Moore said. “We're in a situation where they're not replacing their numbers. We'll actually be in a situation where we're in a steep decline.” ___ Whittle reported from Portland, Maine. ___ This story was supported by funding from the Walton Family Foundation.

MarketBeat Week in Review – 07/07 - 07/11,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/marketbeat-week-in-review-07-07-07-11/,"Investors endured another volatile week. Tariff concerns escalated on Friday, jeopardizing the Dow and S&P 500's weekly gains. The NASDAQ, however, continued to hold strong, with one of the week’s highlights being NVIDIA Corp. NASDAQ: NVDA becoming the first company to achieve a $4 trillion market cap. The strong move in NVDA stock highlights the idea that the AI trade is alive and well. For investors, this means that a super cycle in chip stocks is still in its early stages. Next week will bring a firehose of information with inflation data, retail sales data, and the official start of a new earnings season. At this time, expectations are for better-than-expected earnings, but analysts will be watching the guidance closely. The MarketBeat analysts will be doing the same. Here are some of our most popular articles from this week. Articles by Thomas Hughes The MarketBeat site has several free tools that can help investors generate ideas. This week, Thomas Hughes highlighted the Most Upgraded stocks tool, which is frequently a bullish sign, and highlighted three stocks receiving the most upgrades from analysts. Hughes also wrote about Micron Technology Inc. NASDAQ: MU's recent gains. Insiders are selling, but Hughes points out that institutional support after a strong earnings report makes MU stock a clear buying opportunity. SoundHound AI Inc. NASDAQ: SOUN dipped sharply as short interest put pressure on the stock. Hughes noted that pressure has turned into fuel for a rally as positive AI news is causing short covering that could carry through the summer. Articles by Chris Markoch Chris Markoch was one of many MarketBeat analysts who took the opportunity to highlight stocks that may benefit from the ""One Big Beautiful Bill."" The defense budget is growing, and Markoch analyzed three large-cap defense stocks that are likely to have bullish momentum for the rest of 2025 and beyond. The U.S. dollar had its worst first half of the year since 1972. A weak dollar should put pressure on international travel. Markoch cited data that showed that wasn’t the case and explained why that’s bullish for these three travel stocks. Palantir Technologies Inc. NASDAQ: PLTR continues to have valuation concerns. However, Markoch explained why the company is on target to generate $1 billion in revenue in a single quarter for the first time in 2025. That would spotlight the company’s operating leverage and may justify the premium valuation the stock enjoys. Articles by Ryan Hasson Knowing when to take profits is one key to successful investing. This week, Ryan Hasson highlighted three technology stocks showing clear signs of being overbought and ripe for a pullback. Hasson also examined some undervalued stocks this week. But not just any undervalued stocks—Hasson analyzed five dividend stocks with a low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio but a high-yield dividend that offers an attractive payout. Hasson also pointed out the technical signals that Alphabet Inc. NASDAQ: GOOGL is recovering. Although the tech giant has trailed its Mag 7 counterparts this year, Alphabet stock is recovering and may benefit from a strong earnings report. Articles by Gabriel Osorio-Mazilli Cryptocurrency assets made a strong move this week, but Gabriel Osorio-Mazilli points out that, for three companies, a strategic shift to Bitcoin investments is starting to look more like speculation as they give off a 1999 dot-com era feel. This week was Prime Week, which is usually bullish for Amazon.com Inc. NASDAQ: AMZN's e-commerce division. However, a 14% year-over-year decline in the early hours of the event didn't decrease interest in AMZN stock. Osorio-Mazilli highlighted the key technical indicator suggesting further gains in AMZN stock. Apple Inc. NASDAQ: AAPL is one of the laggards in the tech sector and the broader market. Osorio-Mazilli explained why patient investors may want to follow analysts' lead and buy AAPL stock to ride a strong recovery. Articles by Leo Miller A significant line item in the Trump administration’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” removes the tax credits for electric vehicles (EVs) after September 2025. This week, Leo Miller looked at two under-the-radar EV companies and explained why the absence of tax credits may give each stock a charge. Like many healthcare stocks, Centene Corp. NYSE: CNC had a rough week after withdrawing its 2025 full-year guidance. However, Miller pointed out that the 40% sell-off makes CNC stock more attractive strictly based on valuation. But even risk-tolerant investors may want to wait for more clarity around future Medicaid cuts. Data shows that alcohol consumption is dropping in the United States. That would seem to be bearish for Constellation Brands NYSE: STZ, but Constellation is a top-20 stock for Berkshire-Hathaway Inc. NYSE: BRK.B, and recent upgrades may remind investors why it’s tough to bet against Warren Buffett. Articles by Nathan Reiff Equity offerings dilute shareholder value and typically have a negative impact on a stock’s performance. But Nathan Reiff explained why D-Wave Quantum Inc. NYSE: QBTS is bucking that trend. For now, investors are willing to consider the company’s enhanced cash position, which stabilizes it in one of the market’s most attractive sectors. Savvy investors know they don’t have to like the “One Big Beautiful Bill” to profit from it. This week, Reiff put that statement to work and highlighted three stocks that lean into sectors that are likely to be clear winners from the bill. Reiff also analyzed the strong move in cryptocurrency stocks, noting that an increase in the debt ceiling amplifies concerns about U.S. government debt. Like the current bull run in gold, investors should consider these three crypto mining stocks as a way to gain exposure with less risk. Articles by Dan Schmidt A company's value is not the same as its stock price. For example, Costco Wholesale Corp. NASDAQ: COST stock may seem costly, even though the company’s business model performs well and offers good value for consumers. Nonetheless, Dan Schmidt pointed out that opportunistic investors might view BJ’s Wholesale Club Holdings Inc. NYSE: BJ as a short-term buy for better value compared to COST stock. The solar industry expects to face stricter regulations and the removal of the industry’s 30% tax credits at the end of the year. However, Schmidt highlighted several last-minute provisions in the ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" that may benefit these three solar stocks. Articles by Jeffrey Neal Johnson BigBear.ai Holdings Inc. NYSE: BBAI has been one of the best-performing stocks in the last month. BBAI stock is up 90% in the last 30 days as the AI trade has gained steam. This week, Jeffrey Neal Johnson explained the reasons for the recent rally and the analyst sentiment that suggests why BBAI stock can still move higher. Another of 2025’s top performers, AST Spacemobile Inc. NASDAQ: ASTS, has declined sharply over the past 30 days. However, Johnson reminded investors that while traders are taking profits, investors should see this as an opportunity to buy shares at a lower price. Although CAVA Group Inc. NYSE: CAVA is down 19% in 2025, Johnson says analysts still believe the stock’s business model looks tasty. That could be a buying opportunity for fans of a company that’s creating a new category in fast casual dining. Articles by Jordan Chussler Many investors are eyeing a Brian Niccol-led turnaround for Starbucks Corp. NASDAQ: SBUX. But Jordan Chussler pointed out that investors may be finding out what coffee enthusiasts already know. Dutch Bros NYSE: BROS is a name to keep an eye on. Chussler explained why the company’s current and future growth plans may make BROS stock a compelling growth name in this space. Articles by Brian O’Connell UnitedHealth Group NYSE: UNH has been weighing down the Dow index almost by itself. However, Brian O’Connell pointed out that several company insiders and members of Congress have been buying UNH stock in the last 90 days. O’Connell explained how this enthusiasm in UNH stock aligned with a change in the company’s C-Suite, and why it may not be too late for risk-tolerant investors to take a position.

"Russian drone, cruise missile and bomb attacks kill at least 6 in Ukraine",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/russian-drone-and-cruise-missile-attacks-kill-at-least-2-in-ukraine-2025-07-12/,"Russia pounded Ukraine with hundreds of drones and missiles overnight and Saturday as part of a stepped-up bombing campaign that killed at least six people and wounded dozens, officials said. Two people died and 26 were wounded when Russian forces overnight attacked the Bukovina area in the Chernivtsi region of southwestern Ukraine with four drones and a missile, regional Gov. Ruslan Zaparaniuk said Saturday. He said that the two died from falling drone debris. Another drone attack in Ukraine’s western Lviv region wounded 12 people, regional Gov. Maksym Kozytskyi said. Poland’s air force scrambled fighter jets in areas bordering Ukraine in response to the overnight attacks, which targeted again a region that is a crucial hub for receiving foreign military aid. Three people alsos were wounded in Kharkiv in northeastern Ukraine when the city was hit by eight drones and two missiles, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said. Russia fired 597 drones and decoys, along with 26 cruise missiles, into Ukraine overnight into Saturday, Ukraine’s air force said. Of these, 319 drones and 25 cruise missiles were shot down and 258 decoy drones were lost, likely having been electronically jammed. Two people were killed Saturday morning in a missile strike in the Dnipropetrovsk region, according to regional Gov. Serhii Lysak. Two other people were killed Saturday in the Sumy region by a Russian guided bomb, local officials said. Russia has been stepping up its long-range attacks on Ukrainian cities. Earlier this week, Russia fired more than 700 attack and decoy drones, topping previous nightly barrages and targeting Lutsk near the border with Poland in western Ukraine. Russia's intensifying long-range attacks have coincided with a concerted effort to break through parts of the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line, where Ukrainian troops are under severe pressure. Russia’s Defense Ministry said it shot down 33 Ukrainian drones overnight into Saturday. One person was wounded Saturday in a Ukrainian drone strike on Russia’s Belgorod region and another in the Kursk region, both of which border Ukraine, local officials said. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

What the ‘black box’ can tell us about plane crashes,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/what-the-black-box-can-tell-us-about-plane-crashes-2025-07-12/,"NEW DELHI (AP) — A preliminary finding into last month’s Air India plane crash has suggested the aircraft’s fuel control switches were turned off, starving the engines of fuel and causing a loss of engine thrust shortly after takeoff. The report, issued by India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau on Saturday, also found that one pilot was heard on the cockpit voice recorder asking the other why he cut off the fuel in the flight’s final moment. The other pilot replied he did not do so. The Air India flight — a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner — crashed on June 12 and killed at least 260 people, including 19 on the ground, in the northwestern city of Ahmedabad. Only one passenger survived the crash, which is one of India’s worst aviation disasters. The report based its finding on the data recovered from the plane’s black boxes — combined cockpit voice recorders and flight data recorders. Here is an explanation of what black boxes are and what they can do: The cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder are tools that help investigators reconstruct the events that lead up to a plane crash. They’re orange in color to make them easier to find in wreckage, sometimes at great ocean depths. They’re usually installed a plane’s tail section, which is considered the most survivable part of the aircraft, according to the National Transportation Safety Board's website. The cockpit voice recorder collects radio transmissions and sounds such as the pilot’s voices and engine noises, according to the NTSB’s website. Depending on what happened, investigators may pay close attention to the engine noise, stall warnings and other clicks and pops, the NTSB said. And from those sounds, investigators can often determine engine speed and the failure of some systems. Investigators can also listen to conversations between the pilots and crew and communications with air traffic control. Experts make a meticulous transcript of the voice recording, which can take up to a week. The flight data recorder monitors a plane’s altitude, airspeed and heading, according to the NTSB. Those factors are among at least 88 parameters that newly built planes must monitor. Some can collect the status of more than 1,000 other characteristics, from a wing’s flap position to the smoke alarms. The NTSB said it can generate a computer animated video reconstruction of the flight from the information collected. At least two people have been credited with creating devices that record what happens on an airplane. One is French aviation engineer François Hussenot. In the 1930s, he found a way to record a plane’s speed, altitude and other parameters onto photographic film, according to the website for European plane-maker Airbus. In the 1950s, Australian scientist David Warren came up with the idea for the cockpit voice recorder, according to his 2010 AP obituary. Warren had been investigating the crash of the world’s first commercial jet airliner, the Comet, in 1953, and thought it would be helpful for airline accident investigators to have a recording of voices in the cockpit, the Australian Department of Defence said in a statement after his death. Warren designed and constructed a prototype in 1956. But it took several years before officials understood just how valuable the device could be and began installing them in commercial airlines worldwide. Some have suggested that it stems from Hussenot’s device because it used film and “ran continuously in a light-tight box, hence the name ‘black box,’” according to Airbus, which noted that orange was the box’s chosen color from the beginning to make it easy to find. Other theories include the boxes turning black when they get charred in a crash, the Smithsonian Magazine wrote in 2019. The media continues to use the term, the magazine wrote, “because of the sense of mystery it conveys in the aftermath of an air disaster.” Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

"DOGE sprouts in red states, as governors embrace the cost-cutter brand and make it their own",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/doge-sprouts-in-red-states-as-governors-embrace-the-cost-cutter-brand-and-make-it-their-own-2025-07-12/,"HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — The brash and chaotic first days of President Donald Trump 's Department of Government Efficiency, once led by the world's richest man Elon Musk, spawned state-level DOGE mimicry as Republican governors and lawmakers aim to show they are in step with their party's leader. Governors have always made political hay out of slashing waste or taming bureaucracy, but DOGE has, in some ways, raised the stakes for them to show that they are zealously committed to cutting costs. Many drive home the point that they have always been focused on cutting government, even if they're not conducting mass layoffs. “I like to say we were doing DOGE before DOGE was a thing,” Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said in announcing her own task force in January. Critics agree that some of these initiatives are nothing new and suggest they are wasteful, essentially duplicating built-in processes that are normally the domain of legislative committees or independent state auditors. At the same time, some governors are using their DOGE vehicles to take aim at GOP targets of the moment, such as welfare programs or diversity, equity and inclusion programs. And some governors who might be eyeing a White House run in 2028 are rebranding their cost-cutting initiatives as DOGE, perhaps eager to claim the mantle of the most DOGE of them all. At least 26 states have initiated DOGE-style efforts of varying kinds, according to the Economic Policy Institute based in Washington, D.C. Most DOGE efforts were carried out through a governor’s order — including by governors in Florida, Iowa, Louisiana, Montana, New Hampshire and Oklahoma — or by lawmakers introducing legislation or creating a legislative committee. The state initiatives have a markedly different character than Trump’s slash-and-burn approach, symbolized by Musk’s chainsaw-brandishing appearance at a Conservative Political Action Committee appearance in February. Governors are tending to entrust their DOGE bureaus to loyalists, rather than independent auditors, and are often employing what could be yearslong processes to consolidate procurement, modernize information technology systems, introduce AI tools, repeal regulations or reduce car fleets, office leases or worker headcounts through attrition. Steve Slivinski, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute who researches state government regulatory structures, said that a lot of what he has seen from state-level DOGE initiatives are the “same stuff you do on a pretty regular basis anyway” in state governments. States typically have routine auditing procedures and the ways states have of saving money are “relatively unsexy,"" Slivinski said. And while the state-level DOGE vehicles might be useful over time in finding marginal improvements, ""branding it DOGE is more of a press op rather than anything new or substantially different than what they usually do,” Slivinski said. Analysts at the pro-labor Economic Policy Institute say that governors and lawmakers, primarily in the South and Midwest, are using DOGE to breathe new life into long-term agendas to consolidate power away from state agencies and civil servants, dismantle public services and benefit insiders and privatization advocates. “It's not actually about cutting costs because of some fiscal responsibility,” EPI analyst Nina Mast said. Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry rebranded his “Fiscal Responsibility Program” as Louisiana DOGE, and promoted it as the first to team up with the federal government to scrub illegitimate enrollees from welfare programs. It has already netted $70 million in savings in the Medicaid program in an “unprecedented” coordination, Landry said in June. In Oklahoma, Gov. Kevin Stitt — who says in a blurb on the Oklahoma DOGE website that “I’ve been DOGE-ing in Oklahoma since before it was cool"" — made a DOGE splash with the first report by his Division of Government Efficiency by declaring that the state would refuse some $157 million in federal public health grants. The biggest chunk of that was $132 million intended to support epidemiology and laboratory capacity to control infectious disease outbreaks. The Stitt administration said that funding — about one-third of the total over an eight-year period — exceeded the amount needed. The left-leaning Oklahoma Policy Institute questioned the wisdom of that, pointing to rising numbers of measles and whooping cough cases and the rocky transition under Stitt of the state's public health lab from Oklahoma City to Stillwater. Oklahoma Democrats issued rebukes, citing Oklahoma's lousy public health rankings. “This isn’t leadership,” state Sen. Carri Hicks said. ”It’s negligence."" Stitt's Oklahoma DOGE has otherwise recommended changes in federal law to save money, opened up the suggestion box to state employees and members of the general public and posted a spreadsheet online with cost savings initiatives in his administration. Those include things as mundane as agencies going paperless, refinancing bonds, buying automated lawn mowers for the Capitol grounds or eliminating a fax machine line in the State Board of Licensure for Professional Engineers and Surveyors. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed an executive order in February creating a task force of DOGE teams in each state agency. In the order, DeSantis recited 10 points on what he described as his and Florida’s “history of prudent fiscal management” even before DOGE. Among other things, DeSantis vowed to scrutinize spending by state universities and municipal and county governments — including on DEI initiatives — at a time when DeSantis is pushing to abolish the property taxes that predominantly fund local governments. His administration has since issued letters to universities and governments requesting reams of information and received a blessing from lawmakers, who passed legislation authorizing the inquiry and imposing fines for entities that don’t respond. After the June 30 signing ceremony, DeSantis declared on social media: “We now have full authority to DOGE local governments.” In Arkansas, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders launched her cost-cutting Arkansas Forward last year, before DOGE, and later said the state had done the “same thing” as DOGE. Her administration spent much of 2024 compiling a 97-page report that listed hundreds of ways to possibly save $300 million inside a $6.5 billion budget. Achieving that savings — largely by standardizing information technology and purchasing — would sometimes require up-front spending and take years to realize savings. ___ Follow Marc Levy on X at: https://x.com/timelywriter Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

Beat the heat with these cooling gadgets and wearables,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/beat-the-heat-with-these-cooling-gadgets-and-wearables-2025-07-11/,"You can only sit in front of the fridge with the door open for so long. As heat waves blast the world like a blow dryer on high, folks are reaching for anything that promises a little personal chill: portable mini fans, cooling neck wraps, high-tech vests and all kinds of heat-beating headwear. Of course, cooling gear helps most when paired with basic and safe strategies against the heat: most importantly hydration, shade and rest. Stay out of extreme heat when possible, and know the signs of heat exhaustion or heat stroke. Yet these wearable wonders and breezy gadgets can offer some relief. They might look quirky, but when the AC struggles and the sidewalk feels like a stovetop, they can start to seem like must-haves. Indoors, stay comfy with cool-feel sheets (like those with a silky finish or lightweight fibers), bed fans (where a nozzle inserted into the bed linens pumps a flow of air around you), or a cooling pillow or chill pad, which are filled with a gel that can stay cool for hours. Sleep-product brands include Serta, Sealy, Casper, Pluto and Threshold. The chill pads can work for your own bed and the pets' bed too. There are chillable full-size mattresses (Chilipad, 8Sleep and BedJet get good reviews from The Spruce) and smaller, simple pads (CoolCare and Sharper Image, among others). Clare Epstein, an employee safety expert with Vector Solutions in Tampa, Florida, works to reduce heat stress for at-risk employees in industries like construction, aviation and agriculture. She recommends wearables like cooling scarves and evaporative cooling vests. “By soaking the fabric in cold water at the beginning of the day, the vest slowly cools, and keeps the wearer cool,"" she says. Clothes made of “phase change materials,” or PCMs, contain gel capsules or pads that can help moderate body temperatures. Uline.com advertises a vest that stays under 60 degrees for a few hours, and AlphaCool offers a neck tube that performs similarly. Another feature of the tube, which is made of a polymer material, is that it doesn’t get overly chilled, so it’s safe for kids to use. Also for kids, there’s a line of plush toys from Warmies that includes little critters of the farmyard, ocean, forest and safari that can be popped in the freezer before a trip to the park or playground. Wearable items that incorporate small fans or thermoelectric coolers are also good, Epstein says. And there are vests with tubed reservoirs you can fill with water or electrolytes so you can sip as you go. “These encourage people to take more water breaks, and stay hydrated,” says Epstein. The wearables range is extensive. Along with cooling buffs, headbands, wristbands, socks and scarves, there are cooling brimmed hats and ball caps. Brands include Mission, Ergodyne, and Sunday Afternoon. If you’d prefer a refreshing breeze, USB-chargeable handheld or wearable fans might do the job. Lynn Campbell, co-founder of 10Adventures travel company in Calgary, Alberta, takes a lot of strenuous hiking and cycling trips with her husband, Richard. They've developed some easy hacks for hot days. “We’ll wake up early, so we’re done by 10 or 11 a.m., or if we’re out on the trails, split the day in two, so we rest by water or in the shade over the hottest part” of the day, she says. Wear light colors and thin, breathable fabrics. And bring an umbrella. “This is a game-changer,” Campbell says. “Now we always pack ultralight, compact ones; they’re incredible.” Also, pour cool water on your head and back. “We freeze a few bottles of water so we can pour ice water on us to cool down,” Campbell says. ""Putting the bottles under the armpits, in the groin, or on the back of the neck can effectively cool a person down.” And Annita Katee, a contributing writer for Apartment Therapy, has another way to prep your bed on hot nights: “Pop your sheets into the freezer at least two hours before bedtime, then pull them out right before you hit the sack,” she wrote in a recent post. She folds hers into a zipped plastic bag, flattens it, then sets it on a freezer shelf between ice packs. “The result? A delightfully cool bed that feels like a refreshing oasis against the heat.” ___ New York-based writer Kim Cook covers design and decor topics regularly for The AP.

"Judge orders Trump administration to halt indiscriminate immigration stops, arrests in California",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/judge-orders-trump-administration-to-halt-indiscriminate-immigration-stops-arrests-in-california-2025-07-11/,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — A federal judge on Friday ordered the Trump administration to halt indiscriminate immigration stops and arrests in seven California counties, including Los Angeles. Immigrant advocacy groups filed the lawsuit last week accusing President Donald Trump’s administration of systematically targeting brown-skinned people in Southern California during its ongoing immigration crackdown. The plaintiffs include three detained immigrants and two U.S. citizens, one of whom was held despite showing agents his identification. The filing in U.S. District Court asked a judge to block the administration from using what they call unconstitutional tactics in immigration raids. Immigrant advocates accuse immigration officials of detaining someone based on their race, carrying out warrantless arrests, and denying detainees access to legal counsel at a holding facility in downtown LA. Judge Maame E. Frimpong also issued a separate order barring the federal government from restricting attorney access at a Los Angeles immigration detention facility in response to a request from nonprofit law firm Public Counsel. Frimpong issued the emergency orders, which are a temporary measure while the lawsuit proceeds, the day after a hearing during which advocacy groups argued that the government was violating the Fourth and Fifth amendments of the Constitution. She wrote in the order there was a “mountain of evidence” presented in the case that the federal government was committing the violations they were being accused of. The White House responded quickly to the ruling late Friday. “No federal judge has the authority to dictate immigration policy — that authority rests with Congress and the President,” spokesperson Abigail Jackson said. “Enforcement operations require careful planning and execution; skills far beyond the purview (or) jurisdiction of any judge. We expect this gross overstep of judicial authority to be corrected on appeal.” Immigrants and Latino communities across Southern California have been on edge for weeks since the Trump administration stepped up arrests at car washes, Home Depot parking lots, immigration courts and a range of businesses. Tens of thousands of people have participated in rallies in the region over the raids and the subsequent deployment of the National Guard and Marines. The order also applies to Ventura County, where busloads of workers were detained Thursday while the court hearing was underway after federal agents descended on a cannabis farm, leading to clashes with protesters and multiple injuries. According to the American Civil Liberties Union, the recent wave of immigration enforcement has been driven by an “arbitrary arrest quota” and based on “broad stereotypes based on race or ethnicity.” When detaining the three day laborers who are plaintiffs in the lawsuit, all immigration agents knew about them is that they were Latino and were dressed in construction work clothes, the filing in the lawsuit said. It goes on to describe raids at swap meets and Home Depots where witnesses say federal agents grabbed anyone who “looked Hispanic.” Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, said in an email that “any claims that individuals have been ‘targeted’ by law enforcement because of their skin color are disgusting and categorically FALSE.” McLaughlin said “enforcement operations are highly targeted, and officers do their due diligence” before making arrests. After the ruling, she said “a district judge is undermining the will of the American people.” ACLU attorney Mohammad Tajsar said Brian Gavidia, one of the U.S. citizens who was detained, was “physically assaulted ... for no other reason than he was Latino and working at a tow yard in a predominantly Latin American neighborhood.” Tajsar asked why immigration agents detained everyone at a car wash except two white workers, according to a declaration by a car wash worker, if race wasn’t involved. Representing the government, attorney Sean Skedzielewski said there was no evidence that federal immigration agents considered race in their arrests, and that they only considered appearance as part of the “totality of the circumstances”, including prior surveillance and interactions with people in the field. In some cases, they also operated off “targeted, individualized packages,” he said. “The Department of Homeland Security has policy and training to ensure compliance with the Fourth Amendment,” Skedzielewski said. Lawyers from Immigrant Defenders Law Center and other groups say they also have been denied access to a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in downtown LA known as “B-18” on several occasions since June, according to court documents. Public Counsel lawyer Mark Rosenbaum said in one incident on June 7 attorneys “attempted to shout out basic rights” at a bus of people detained by immigration agents in downtown LA when the government drivers honked their horns to drown them out and chemical munitions akin to tear gas were deployed. Skedzielewski said access was only restricted to “protect the employees and the detainees” during violent protests and it has since been restored. Rosenbaum said lawyers were denied access even on days without any demonstrations nearby, and that the people detained are also not given sufficient access to phones or informed that lawyers were available to them. He said the facility lacks adequate food and beds, which he called “coercive” to getting people to sign papers to agree to leave the country before consulting an attorney. Friday’s order will temporarily prevent the government from solely using apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or English with an accent, presence at a location such as a tow yard or car wash, or someone's occupation as the basis for reasonable suspicion to stop someone. It will also require officials to open B-18 to visitation by attorneys seven days a week and provide detainees access to confidential phone calls with attorneys. Attorneys general for 18 Democratic states also filed briefs in support of the orders. U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents were already barred from making warrantless arrests in a large swath of eastern California after a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction in April.

Boeing settles with a man whose family died in a 737 Max crash in Ethiopia,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/boeing-settles-with-a-man-whose-family-died-in-a-737-max-crash-in-ethiopia-2025-07-11/,"CHICAGO (AP) — Boeing reached a settlement Friday with a Canadian man whose wife and three children were killed in a deadly 2019 crash in Ethiopia, averting the first trial connected to a devastating event that led to a worldwide grounding of Max jets. The jury trial at Chicago’s federal court had been set to start Monday to determine damages for Paul Njoroge of Canada. His family was heading to their native Kenya in March 2019 aboard Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 when it malfunctioned and plummeted to the ground. The wreck killed all 157 people on board. Njoroge, 41, had planned to testify about how the crash affected his life. He has been unable to return to his family home in Toronto because the memories are too painful. He hasn’t been able to find a job. And he has weathered criticism from relatives for not traveling alongside his wife and children. “He’s got complicated grief and sorrow and his own emotional stress,” said Njoroge’s attorney, Robert Clifford. “He’s haunted by nightmares and the loss of his wife and children.” Terms of the deal were not disclosed publicly. Clifford said his client intended to seek “millions” in damages on behalf of his wife and children, but declined to publicly specify an amount ahead of the trial. “The aviation team at Clifford Law Offices has been working round-the-clock in preparation for trial, but the mediator was able to help the parties come to an agreement,” Clifford said in a statement Friday. A Boeing spokesperson said via email Friday that the company had no comment. The proceedings were not expected to delve into technicalities involving the Max version of Boeing’s bestselling 737 airplane, which has been the source of persistent troubles for the company since the Ethiopia crash and one the year before in Indonesia. A combined 346 people, including passengers and crew members, died in those crashes. In 2021, Chicago-based Boeing accepted responsibility for the Ethiopia crash in a deal with the victims’ families that allowed them to pursue individual claims in U.S. courts instead of their home countries. Citizens of 35 countries were killed. Several families of victims have already settled. Terms of those agreements also were not made public. The jetliner heading to Nairobi lost control shortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa Bole International Airport and nose-dived into a barren patch of land. Investigators determined the Ethiopia and Indonesia crashes were caused by a system that relied on a sensor that provided faulty readings and pushed the plane noses down, leaving pilots unable to regain control. After the Ethiopia crash, Max jets were grounded worldwide until the company redesigned the system. This year, Boeing reached a deal with the U.S. Justice Department to avoid criminal prosecutions in both crashes. Among those killed were Njoroge’s wife, Carolyne, and three small children, Ryan, age 6, Kellie, 4, and Rubi, 9 months old, the youngest to die on the plane. Njoroge also lost his mother-in-law, whose family has a separate case. Njoroge, who met his wife in college in Nairobi, was living in Canada at the time of the crash. He had planned to join his family in Kenya later. He testified before Congress in 2019 about repeatedly imagining how his family suffered during the flight, which lasted only six minutes. He has pictured his wife struggling to hold their infant in her lap with two other children seated nearby. “I stay up nights thinking of the horror that they must have endured,” Njoroge said. “The six minutes will forever be embedded in my mind. I was not there to help them. I couldn’t save them.” Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

Trump's sudden shifts make his policies baffling to countries trying to negotiate lower tariffs,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trumps-sudden-shifts-make-his-policies-baffling-to-countries-trying-to-negotiate-lower-tariffs-2025-07-12/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — In the past week, President Donald Trump has managed to make his erratic trade policies even more baffling to countries desperate to negotiate an escape from his wrath. Doubling down on his trade wars, Trump is threatening to raise taxes on many goods from Canada, hike his universal tariff on imports from around the world and punish Brazil for prosecuting his friend, the country’s former president. On Saturday, Trump announced more tariffs still, this time on two of the United States’ biggest trade partners: the European Union and Mexico, at 30% each. Former U.S. trade negotiator Wendy Cutler said that Trump’s recent moves “underscore the growing unpredictability, incoherence and assertiveness’’ of his trade policies. “It’s hard for trading partners to know where they stand with Trump on any given day and what more may be coming their way when least expected,’’ said Cutler, now vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute. On Thursday, the president escalated a conflict he started with America’s second-biggest trading partner and longstanding ally, raising the tariff -- effectively a tax — on many Canadian imports to 35% effective Aug. 1. The sudden announcement, revealed in a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, came despite Carney’s push to reach a trade deal with the United States by July 21. And it followed a big concession by Canada: On June 29, it had agreed to drop a digital services tax that Trump considered unfair to U.S. tech giants. Canada is far from the only target. In an interview Thursday with NBC News Trump suggested that he plans to raise his “baseline’’ tariff on most imports from an already-high 10% to as much as 20%. Trump sees the baseline tariffs as a way to finance the budget-busting tax cuts in the ""One Big Beautiful Bill'' he signed into law July 4. Those tariff threats came after his extraordinary decision Wednesday to impose a 50% import tax on Brazil mainly because he didn’t like the way it was treating former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, who is facing trial for trying to overturn his electoral defeat in 2022. In his letter to current Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Trump also incorrectly claimed that Brazilian trade barriers had caused “unsustainable Trade Deficits against the United States.’’ In fact, U.S. exports to Brazil have exceeded imports for 18 straight years, including a $29 billion surplus last year. For some, Trump's action against Brazil indicates he's trying to exert influence over more than trade. “Trump seems to view tariffs as an instrument to influence not just other countries’ trade and economic policies but even their domestic legal and political matters,"" said Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University. Trump’s faith in the economic superpowers of tariffs is unshaken even though they so far have proven largely ineffective in bullying other countries to cut deals. On April 2, Trump announced the 10% baseline tariffs and larger “reciprocal’’ tariffs – up to 50% -- on dozens of countries with which the United States runs trade deficits. But responding to a rout in global financial markets, he quickly suspended the reciprocal tariffs for 90 days to give countries a chance to negotiate. The administration promised “90 deals in 90 days’’ but got only two – with the United Kingdom and Vietnam -- before the deadline ran out Wednesday. Rather than reinstituting the reciprocal tariffs, Trump sent letters to 23 countries saying he’ll impose levies ranging from 20% on the Philippines to the 50% on Brazil Aug. 1 if they couldn’t reach an agreement. Chad Bown, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, was not surprised that Trump needed more time to press U.S. trading partners to do more to open their markets to U.S. exports — though another three weeks is unlikely to be enough time to reach substantive agreements. “For each of these countries, they have their own domestic challenges about what they can and can’t offer,’’ he said. “There’s a reason why that market access hasn’t been granted before ... they have domestic political constituencies that argue to keep protection in place. And those just aren’t problems that can easily be solved in a matter of weeks.’’ Malaysia, for instance, has “specific red lines’’ it will not cross, Trade Minister Zafrul Aziz said Wednesday, including U.S. demands involving government contracts, halal certification, medical standards and a digital tax. But Malaysia has pledged to buy 30 Boeing planes and offered other concessions involving semiconductors and technology. “It has to be fair,” he said. “If the deal does not benefit Malaysia, we should not have a deal.’’ Still, the United States’ $30 trillion economy and free-spending consumers give Trump considerable leverage, especially over countries that depend on trade. “These countries need the United States,’’ said Matthew Goodman, director of the Council on Foreign Relations’ Center for Geoeconomic Studies. ""They need our market.’’ Thailand, facing the threat of a 36% Trump tariff Aug. 1, is continuing to push for a deal and has offered to open its market to more U.S. farm, energy and industrial products. Trump said Vietnam gave U.S. companies duty-free access to its market while agreeing to a 20% U.S. tariff on its exports — though details of the deal have not been released. “The Vietnam deal was fantastic,’’ Stephen Miran, chair of Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers, crowed last Sunday on ABC News’ “This Week with George Stephanopoulos.’’ “It’s extremely one-sided.’’ Other countries “can’t afford to walk away,'’ said Goodman, former director for international economics on the National Security Council. “But they’re going to be increasingly unhappy and resistant to the most over-the-top requests.’’ Sometimes there’s a backlash against U.S. bullying. Carney’s Liberal party, for example, won a come-from-behind election victory in April because he stood up to Trump’s pressure. And countries are beginning to look for alternatives to economic reliance on the United States. Canada is negotiating a trade pact with Southeast Asian countries, some of which are also moving closer to China. Foreign governments might also simply hope to outlast Trump, who has shown a willingness to declare victory after signing “framework’’ agreements such as one with China that leave the toughest issues for future negotiations. “For Trump, the squeeze is more important than the juice,” said William Reinsch, a former U.S. trade official now at the Center of Strategic and International Studies. “What’s important to him is winning – the public, visible appearance of winning. And what he wins is less important. “So the trick for these countries becomes: ‘How do we let him win in a way that allows us to make the least damaging concessions?’” ____ Eileen Ng in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, contributed to this story.

British man extradited to US to face federal charges in alleged $99 million wine scam,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/british-man-extradited-to-us-to-face-federal-charges-in-alleged-99-million-wine-scam-2025-07-11/,"NEW YORK (AP) — A British man has been brought to the U.S. to face charges in connection with an alleged $99 million Ponzi-like fraud involving expensive wines. James Wellesley, 58, pleaded not guilty during his arraignment Friday in Brooklyn federal court following his extradition from the United Kingdom, where he was arrested in 2022. He was ordered detained by a judge pending trial on wire fraud and money laundering charges. A lawyer for Wellesley didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment. His co-defendant, Stephen Burton, was extradited from Morocco in 2023 after using a bogus Zimbabwean passport to enter that country. Burton, a 60-year-old British national, has also been detained and pleaded not guilty to similar charges in the same Brooklyn court. Prosecutors say the two men ran a company called Bordeaux Cellars that brokered loans between investors and wealthy wine collectors that were secured by their wine collections. From 2017 to 2019, they solicited $99 million in investments from residents of New York and other areas, promising their clients that they would profit from interest on the loans. But the wealthy wine collectors did not exist, no loans were made, and Bordeaux Cellars did not have custody of the wine securing the loans, prosecutors say. Instead, Burton and Wellesley used loan money provided by investors for themselves and to make fraudulent interest payments to other investors, prosecutors alleged. If convicted, the two face up to 20 years in prison each. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

The Meteoric Rise of Rocket Lab: A Space Stock to Watch,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/the-meteoric-rise-of-rocket-lab-a-space-stock-to-watch/,"Rocket Lab USA NASDAQ: RKLB has quickly evolved from a niche launch provider into one of the most exciting space and defense industry players. With shares up nearly 700% over the past 12 months, the stock has garnered significant attention, and for good reason. Rocket Lab continues to outperform through execution, momentum, and meaningful contract wins. Rocket Lab's story is becoming hard to ignore for investors who are just discovering the company. Rocket Lab was founded in 2006 by CEO Peter Beck and went public via SPAC in 2021. Initially known for its small satellite launch capabilities via its Electron rocket, the company has since expanded into spacecraft manufacturing, satellite components, and now satellite payloads. Electron remains Rocket Lab’s workhorse. It’s one of the most frequently launched small rockets globally, with 68 successful missions to date. However, what truly sets RKLB apart is its vertical integration. The company designs and builds nearly every aspect of its missions in-house, from solar panels and reaction wheels to full satellite buses. This enables Rocket Lab to maintain cost control, ensure quality, and execute more quickly than many of its competitors. RKLB has delivered one of the most impressive runs in the market over the past year. Shares have surged nearly 700% over the last 12 months, fueled by improving fundamentals, strong contract wins, and a growing reputation as a reliable launch and space systems provider. Year-to-date, the stock has risen an impressive 53% and is fresh from making a new all-time high on Tuesday. Just last month, the company completed its 68th successful Electron launch, just 48 hours after the 67th, marking its fastest turnaround yet from its New Zealand launch complex. Rocket Lab completed four missions in June alone, bringing its year-to-date tally for 2025 to ten launches with a 100% success rate. This reliability is critical as the space economy becomes increasingly essential to both commercial and government interests. A string of recent achievements underpins Rocket Lab’s momentum. Most recently, the company announced it had completed the Critical Design Review (CDR) for the U.S. Space Development Agency’s T2TL-Beta constellation. As the program’s prime contractor, Rocket Lab will deliver 18 satellites for the Department of Defense’s Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture. An initiative that aims to build a secure, low-latency LEO communications network for U.S. and allied forces. This milestone clears the way for full-scale production and cements Rocket Lab’s transition from launch services into full-scale satellite manufacturing and national security work. Peter Beck recently confirmed on CNBC that the company remains on track to debut its Neutron rocket. It’s a reusable, medium-lift vehicle, expected to be operational by the end of this year. If successful, Neutron would enable Rocket Lab to compete directly with SpaceX in the medium-lift launch category and significantly expand its addressable market. In short, if successful, Neutron would catapult RKLB to the next level. Beck also highlighted the strategic acquisition of GEOST, which brings space-based sensing and payload capabilities into Rocket Lab’s portfolio. This is yet another step toward becoming an end-to-end space solutions provider. Analysts have begun to take note of Rocket Lab’s upward trajectory. Cantor Fitzgerald recently raised its price target to a Street-high $35, citing the company’s strategic execution and growing backlog. Overall, sentiment remains bullish, particularly as the company approaches its first Neutron launch. The stock has a Moderate Buy rating based on 12 ratings. However, the consensus price target, which implies a 22% downside potential, raises some concerns regarding the company's current valuation. Rocket Lab’s meteoric rise is no accident. With strong leadership, accelerating execution, and a growing list of high-profile contracts, the company is transforming from a niche launch firm into a full-fledged aerospace and defense powerhouse. For investors looking for long-term growth potential in a sector with tailwinds from both government and commercial demand, Rocket Lab remains one of the most compelling and dynamic names in the space.

Musk's latest Grok chatbot searches for billionaire mogul's views before answering questions,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/musks-latest-grok-chatbot-searches-for-billionaire-moguls-views-before-answering-questions-2025-07-11/,"The latest version of Elon Musk's artificial intelligence chatbot Grok is echoing the views of its billionaire creator, so much so that it will sometimes search online for Musk's stance on an issue before offering up an opinion. The unusual behavior of Grok 4, the AI model that Musk's company xAI released late Wednesday, has surprised some experts. Built using huge amounts of computing power at a Tennessee data center, Grok is Musk's attempt to outdo rivals such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini in building an AI assistant that shows its reasoning before answering a question. Musk's deliberate efforts to mold Grok into a challenger of what he considers the tech industry's “woke” orthodoxy on race, gender and politics has repeatedly got the chatbot into trouble, most recently when it spouted antisemitic tropes, praised Adolf Hitler and made other hateful commentary to users of Musk's X social media platform just days before Grok 4's launch. But its tendency to consult with Musk's opinions appears to be a different problem. “It’s extraordinary,” said Simon Willison, an independent AI researcher who's been testing the tool. ""You can ask it a sort of pointed question that is around controversial topics. And then you can watch it literally do a search on X for what Elon Musk said about this, as part of its research into how it should reply."" One example widely shared on social media — and which Willison duplicated — asked Grok to comment on the conflict in the Middle East. The prompted question made no mention of Musk, but the chatbot looked for his guidance anyway. As a so-called reasoning model, much like those made by rivals OpenAI or Anthropic, Grok 4 shows its “thinking” as it goes through the steps of processing a question and coming up with an answer. Part of that thinking this week involved searching X, the former Twitter that's now merged into xAI, for anything Musk said about Israel, Palestine, Gaza or Hamas. “Elon Musk’s stance could provide context, given his influence,” the chatbot told Willison, according to a video of the interaction. “Currently looking at his views to see if they guide the answer.” Musk and his xAI co-founders introduced the new chatbot in a livestreamed event Wednesday night but haven't published a technical explanation of its workings — known as a system card — that companies in the AI industry typically provide when introducing a new model. The company also didn't respond to an emailed request for comment Friday. “In the past, strange behavior like this was due to system prompt changes,"" which is when engineers program specific instructions to guide a chatbot's response, said Tim Kellogg, principal AI architect at software company Icertis. “But this one seems baked into the core of Grok and it’s not clear to me how that happens,” Kellogg said. ""It seems that Musk’s effort to create a maximally truthful AI has somehow led to it believing its own values must align with Musk’s own values.” The lack of transparency is troubling for computer scientist Talia Ringer, a professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign who earlier in the week criticized the company's handling of the technology's antisemitic outbursts. Ringer said the most plausible explanation for Grok's search for Musk's guidance is assuming the person is asking for the opinions of xAI or Musk. “I think people are expecting opinions out of a reasoning model that cannot respond with opinions,"" Ringer said. ""So, for example, it interprets ‘Who do you support, Israel or Palestine?’ as 'Who does xAI leadership support?” Willison also said he finds Grok 4's capabilities impressive but said people buying software ""don’t want surprises like it turning into ‘mechaHitler’ or deciding to search for what Musk thinks about issues.” “Grok 4 looks like it’s a very strong model. It’s doing great in all of the benchmarks,” Willison said. “But if I’m going to build software on top of it, I need transparency.” Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

U.S. sales of the colorfully packaged morning staple have been in a decades-long decline, a trend back in the spotlight with news that Italian confectioner Ferrero Group plans to purchase WK Kellogg, maker of Corn Flakes, Froot Loops, Rice Krispies and other familiar brands. Except for a brief period during the coronavirus pandemic, when many workers were home and had time to sit down with a bowl of cereal and milk, sales of cold cereal have steadily fallen for at least 25 years, experts say. In the 52 weeks ending July 3, 2021, Americans bought nearly 2.5 billion boxes of cereal, according to market research company Nielsen IQ. In the same period this year, the number was down more than 13% to 2.1 billion. Cereal has been struggling for multiple reasons. The rise of more portable options like Nutri-Grain bars and Clif Bars – which both went on sale in the early 1990s – made it easier for consumers to grab breakfast on the go. Concerns about food processing and sugar intake have also dimmed some consumers’ enthusiasm for cereals. One cup of Lucky Charms contains 24% of a consumer’s daily recommended intake of sugar, for example. “Cereal finds it really hard to get out from underneath that,” said Tom Rees, global insight manager for staple foods at the consulting company Euromonitor. “It can't escape the fact that it doesn't look like a natural food. You have to create it and form it.” Rees noted that for decades, cereal manufacturers focused on adding vitamins and minerals to build cereal's health credentials. But consumers now are looking for simplified ingredient lists. Artificial dyes — like the petroleum-based colors that brighten Froot Loops — have also come under fire. Last fall, dozens of people rallied outside WK Kellogg's Battle Creek, Michigan, headquarters demanding that it remove artificial dyes from its cereals. Kellogg and General Mills — another major U.S. cereal maker — have since pledged to phase out artificial dyes. Add to that, consumers are expanding their idea of what breakfast can be. Yogurt and shakes have replaced the traditional bacon and eggs. Kenton Barello, a vice president at the market research firm YouGov, said his polling shows that Generation Z consumers, who were born between 1997 and 2007, eat more vegetables for breakfast than other generations. Barello said YouGov’s polling also shows that members of Gen Z are less likely to eat breakfast but still buy ready-to-eat cereal, suggesting they’re eating it as a snack or for other meals. “With younger generations, there are differences in their relationship with food and these eating moments,” Barello said. “They are going about breakfast in a different way than Millennials, Gen X and Baby Boomers.” Cereal's struggles are part of what led to the breakup of the Kellogg Company. In 2023, the century-old company that put Battle Creek, Michigan, on the map split into two companies. Kellanova took popular snack brands like Cheez-Its, Pringles and Pop-Tarts as well as international cereals, and WK Kellogg made cereals for the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean. In 2024, M&M's maker Mars Inc. announced a plan to buy Kellanova for more than $30 billion. That plan has cleared U.S. regulators but is still awaiting regulatory approval in Europe. WK Kellogg was left to try to rejuvenate the cereal business. The sale of WK Kellogg to Ferrero doesn't mean supermarket cereal aisles are at risk of extinction. Packaged food companies have options for turning around their soggy cereal sales, Rees said. He thinks Kellogg's Mashups line, which mixed brands like Frosted Flakes and Froot Loops into one box, appeal to younger consumers, who tend to like interesting flavor combinations. The market may also have a fragmented future, according to Rees. Companies may have to accept that younger buyers want a sweet-and-spicy cereal while older buyers might want a Keto-friendly option. “The future might be realizing that the era of ‘This brand will serve everybody’ isn't going to happen,” Rees said. Julia Mills, a food analyst with the consulting company Mintel, thinks the shrinking population of children in the U.S. gives cereal makers the opportunity to shift to more sophisticated flavors and packaging. Cereal could be positioned as a fancy topping for yogurt, for example, or a fiber-rich food that can improve gut health. Some niche cereal brands, like high-fiber Poop Like a Champion cereal and high-protein, zero-sugar Magic Spoon, are already doing that. But legacy brands say they shouldn't be counted out. Jeffrey Harmening, the chairman and chief executive officer of Cheerios maker General Mills, said his company considered trying to acquire Magic Spoon. Instead, it made high-protein versions of Cheerios, which now outsells Magic Spoon. “The key to longer term is, honestly, is giving consumers more of what they want,” Harmening said during a conference call with investors in March.

3 Hot Tech Stocks Showing Bullish Price Action Right Now,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/3-hot-tech-stocks-showing-bullish-price-action-right-now/,"With attention focused on mega caps and AI, it's easy to overlook riskier trades like small and mid-cap technologies. However, bullish activity in the charts of Amprius Technologies NYSE: AMPX, Joby Aviation NYSE: JOBY, and Ambarella NASDAQ: AMBA highlights the potential they offer. The activity of note includes increased volume, bullish swings in momentum, and price action that is setting new highs, confirming a reversal or bottom. Amprius Technologies' stock price is moving higher, setting multi-year highs in Q3 2025, with rising volume and convergent momentum. The move is due to the company’s improving manufacturing capabilities, ramping up sales, and substantial Q1 outperformance. The Q1 revenue topped MarketBeat’s reported consensus by approximately 35% and was compounded by a favorable outlook. Manufacturing capabilities are improving, but the demand is there to match. The forecast for this company’s growth is phenomenal, and based on its results and industry trends, it seems far too cautious. The consensus forecasts revenue growth to sustain a high, triple-digit pace for the eighth consecutive quarter and to continue for at least the next few quarters. What does Amprius Technologies do? It makes advanced silicon-anode lithium-ion batteries suitable for a wide range of applications, including aerospace and defense. Its largest customers are in the defense and eVTOL industries, but the client base is diverse, growing by roughly 65% in Q1 to over 100. The seven analysts tracked by MarketBeat rate AMPX unanimously as a Buy and expect it to advance by 60% at the consensus. The revision trend in 2025 is positive, leading to a high-end value of $15, representing a 150% gain when reached.  The story with Joby Aviation in 2025 is that it is ramping its manufacturing capability and is on track for commercial operations in 2026. The exact timing is still uncertain, but the regulatory process is progressing smoothly and is expected to be completed this year. The deal pipeline is also growing. Not only is it working on air-taxi services for Dubai, the United Kingdom, and the United States, but it has also inked a distribution agreement in Saudi Arabia that could be worth $1 billion or more in total revenue within a few years. Bullish price action in this stock includes elevated volume, a volume spike, and a fresh multi-year high. The momentum is also bullish, converging with the fresh highs, and indicates a retest of critical resistance will come soon. Critical resistance is near the $12 level, serving as a pivot point for the market that could lead to a substantial inflow. Analysts rated Joby as a Hold and viewed it as overvalued in mid-July. However, increased coverage and price target increases have the consensus trending higher. It is expected to report for Q2 in early August and is likely to provide a catalyst for its share price.  Ambarella is well-positioned for substantial, sustained, long-term growth in a world where physical AI is the future. Its shift to computer vision semiconductor solutions, visual processing, and edge computing set it up well, and the expectations are high. The consensus is for a sustained, low 20% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through the middle of the next decade, and this is likely to be a conservative estimate. Bullish price action includes a sharp price advance in late June and early July, a month ahead of the Q2 earnings report. It confirms a recent bottom and the bottom of a long-term trading range, aligning with numerous buy signals over the past two years. Rising volume and bullish indicators compound the signal, suggesting a move to the $80 range is coming. The Q2 release may catalyze a move above that level. AMBA’s 2025 analysts' activity is light and slightly mixed. However, the takeaway is that 12 analysts rate the stock as a Moderate Buy, the range of targets is narrowing around the consensus, and they expect it to advance by 25% at the consensus.

Meta and Autonomous Advertising: The Stock's Next Big Tailwind?,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/meta-and-autonomous-advertising-the-stocks-next-big-tailwind/,"As one of the world’s largest and most influential companies, Meta Platforms NASDAQ: META is often the subject of interesting reports containing juicy rumors. One of the more impactful reports over the past several months comes from the Wall Street Journal. It highlights Meta’s growing reliance on artificial intelligence to reshape its core advertising business. If Meta succeeds in achieving its vision, as laid out in the report, the stock could experience huge positive implications. So, what exactly are Meta’s latest big ambitions, and why could they be so impactful? Meta owns one of the world’s largest advertising businesses, generating approximately $166 billion in advertising revenue over the last 12 months. In 2024, the tech company managed to accelerate its ad revenue growth rate. Despite the company's massive scale, the figure ticked up to 22% compared to 16% in 2023. Meta’s investments in AI have driven much of this, improving ad targeting among its approximately 3.4 billion users. This has led to marketers purchasing more ads on Meta’s apps and paying more per ad. Now, Meta is making efforts to extend these positive trends even further. According to reports, Meta is looking to allow users to fully automate ad creation and targeting using AI by the end of 2026. Marketing teams could simply provide a picture of their product and give an ad budget. Then AI will take over the process, creating text, images, and video for the campaign, while also deciding which potential customers are best to show the ads to. So, why could achieving this be such a big deal for Meta? The costs of a company creating and managing its ad campaigns can be very high. Data from SiegeMedia estimates that basic video ads cost $3,500 per minute. Additionally, the firm estimates that developing a full-fledged ad campaign for medium-sized businesses can cost between $10,000 and $20,000 a month. These costs can be a lot to stomach, especially for smaller businesses. Using Meta’s AI tools, it is possible that these costs could be dramatically reduced. That would be a big incentive for smaller firms to direct spending away from traditional campaign creation providers and towards Meta. That’s not to say that Meta will eliminate the need for businesses to use more bespoke ad-creation services. But, as the company’s AI tools become more advanced, Meta can bend the curve over time. This is particularly true given that AI capabilities are improving rapidly. It is hard to see traditional marketing services learning and advancing their skills faster than AI. These improving capabilities can lead to continuing trends discussed above: more ads going toward Meta and higher prices paid per ad. This can benefit the company’s revenue growth and margins, which are key factors that can help push Meta's shares higher. Improving its AI tools goes back to the crux of Meta’s value proposition: making ads more efficient, as discussed by eMarketer. Rather than simply trying to put out more ads, return on ad spending (ROAS) is what marketers seek. This allows them to generate the same amount of business for a lower cost, which is the key to growing profits. Based on this data, Meta ads generally do a better job at this than those of its Magnificent Seven peer, Google parent company Alphabet NASDAQ: GOOG. Meta ads achieved an average six-to-one ROAS, while Google Ads achieved a significantly lower four-to-one ROAS. Meta is also particularly good for generating brand awareness. This is key for small businesses, who need people to know about their products before they will consider buying them. Based on eMarketer’s data, Meta has done the best job monetizing its user base on social media platforms. In the United States, the average revenue per user (ARPU) for Instagram and Facebook is around $223 and $191, respectively. Third place goes to TikTok, at just $109. This indicates that advertisers believe they are getting strong value from Meta’s apps, as their spending on Instagram and Facebook far exceeds that of other platforms. Overall, improving its AI tools to allow for even more efficient ad campaigns can enable Meta to continue building on the lead it has already gained. This big tailwind could allow revenues, margins, and ultimately shares to go higher long-term. Before you consider Meta Platforms, you'll want to hear this.

Trump administration sues California over egg prices and blames animal welfare laws,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-administration-sues-california-over-egg-prices-and-blames-animal-welfare-laws-2025-07-11/,"The Trump administration is suing the state of California to block animal welfare laws that it says unconstitutionally helped send egg prices soaring. But a group that spearheaded the requirements pushed back, blaming bird flu for the hit to consumers' pocketbooks. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in California on Wednesday, challenges voter initiatives that passed in 2018 and 2008. They require that all eggs sold in California come from cage-free hens. The Trump administration says the law imposes burdensome red tape on the production of eggs and egg products across the country because of the state's outsize role in the national economy. “It is one thing if California passes laws that affects its own State, it is another when those laws affect other States in violation of the U.S. Constitution,” U.S. Agriculture Brooke Rollins said in a statement Thursday. ""Thankfully, President Trump is standing up against this overreach.” Egg prices soared last year and earlier this year due in large part to bird flu, which has forced producers to destroy nearly 175 million birds since early 2022. But prices have come down sharply recently. While the Trump administration claims credit for that, seasonal factors are also important. Avian influenza, which is spread by wild birds, tends to spike during the spring and fall migrations and drop in summer. “Pointing fingers won’t change the fact that it is the President’s economic policies that have been destructive,"" the California Department of Justice said in a statement Friday. ""We’ll see him in court.” The average national price for a dozen Grade A eggs declined to $5.12 in April and $4.55 in May after reaching a record $6.23 in March, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. But the May price was still 68.5% higher than a year earlier. “Trump’s back to his favorite hobby: blaming California for literally everything,” Gov. Gavin Newsom's office said in a social media post. The federal complaint alleges that California contributed to the rise in egg prices with regulations that forced farmers across the country to adopt more expensive production practices. The lawsuit also asserts that it is the federal government's legal prerogative to regulate egg production. So it seeks to permanently block enforcement of the California regulations that flowed from the two ballot measures. “Americans across the country have suffered the consequences of liberal policies causing massive inflation for everyday items like eggs,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement. “Under President Trump’s leadership, we will use the full extent of federal law to ensure that American families are free from oppressive regulatory burdens and restore American prosperity.” While 2018's Proposition 12 also banned the sale of pork and veal in California from animals raised in cages that don’t meet minimum size requirements, the lawsuit only focuses on the state's egg rules. Humane World for Animals, which was named the Humane Society of the United States when it spearheaded the passage of Proposition 12, says avian influenza and other factors drove up egg prices, not animal welfare laws. And it says much of the U.S. egg industry went cage-free anyway because of demand from consumers who don't want eggs from hens confined to tiny spaces. “California has prohibited the sale of cruelly produced eggs for more than a decade — law that has been upheld by courts at every level, including the Supreme Court. Blaming 2025 egg prices on these established animal welfare standards shows that this case is about pure politics, not constitutional law,” Sara Amundson, president of the Humane World Action Fund, said in a statement. The American Egg Board, which represents the industry, said Friday that it will monitor the progress of the lawsuit while continuing to comply with California’s laws, and that it appreciates Rollins’ efforts to support farmers in their fight against bird flu and to stabilize the egg supply. “Egg farmers have been both responsive and responsible in meeting changing demand for cage-free eggs, while supporting all types of egg production, and continuing to provide options in the egg case for consumers,” the board said in a statement.

McDonald's worker arraigned in fatal stabbing of manager at Detroit-area restaurant,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/mcdonalds-worker-arraigned-in-fatal-stabbing-of-manager-at-detroit-area-restaurant-2025-07-11/,"EASTPOINTE, Mich. (AP) — A 26-year-old woman has been arraigned in the fatal stabbing of her manager after being told to leave early from her shift following an argument at a Detroit-area McDonald's restaurant. Afeni Badu Muhammad was arraigned Friday on first-degree premeditated murder and carrying a dangerous weapon with unlawful intent, the Macomb County prosecutor's office said in a release. After being told to leave the Eastpointe restaurant Thursday morning, a masked Muhammad allegedly returned and entered through the employee entrance, according to the prosecutor's office. Eastpointe is just northeast of Detroit. Jennifer Harris, 39, was stabbed multiple times. A customer at the McDonald's drive-thru window fired a gun in an effort to stop the attack on Harris, followed Muhammad as she fled to a vehicle and held her at gunpoint until police arrived. The customer was legally allowed to carry a concealed weapon. “This is an absolutely senseless and heartbreaking tragedy,” Prosecutor Peter Lucido said. “A life was taken in an act of unimaginable violence. The victim leaves behind six children, six young lives that will now grow up without a parent.” Muhammad, of Eastpointe, was being held in the Macomb County Jail on a $25 million bond. A not guilty plea was entered by a judge at Friday's arraignment, according to court records. “There are a lot of things that need to come to light regarding this matter,” Muhammad's arraignment attorney Matthew Licata told The Associated Press. Muhammad has a probable cause conference on July 23 and a preliminary examination on July 30. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

3 Stocks to Buy Ahead of the Upcoming Earnings Season,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/3-stocks-to-buy-ahead-of-the-upcoming-earnings-season/,"Next week marks the beginning of another earnings season. This is a time when stocks can move sharply as investors process and act on a company’s results and guidance. However, experienced investors know that the time to act is frequently before a company reports. This is particularly true when you believe a company is likely to deliver strong results and/or guidance. Taking this active approach positions them for the strong gains that may occur in the days and weeks after the company releases earnings. This quarter, there are three stocks that investors may want to consider buying before the companies report earnings. Two of these companies are beaten down, but the sell-off is likely overdone. Another has been one of the best consumer discretionary stocks to own in the last three years and shows no signs of slowing down. The problems of UnitedHealth Group Inc. NYSE: UNH have been discussed in detail. They certainly warranted the steep 48% pullback in UNH stock over the past three months. It didn’t help that the company missed on the top and bottom lines and lowered guidance in its first quarter earnings report in April. However, the chart is showing that UNH stock formed a clear bottom in the middle of May. But the stock has been consolidating since then with a slightly bullish conviction. Investors should be eyeing an area of resistance around $325, which corresponds to the stock’s 50-day simple moving average (SMA). That catalyst could come from the company’s upcoming earnings report on July 15. A beat-and-raise quarter would support the analysts’ Moderate Buy rating and $415.57 consensus price target, which is a 38% increase from its close on July 8. Notably, while many analysts have downgraded UNH stock since its last earnings report, JPMorgan Chase & Co. NYSE: JPM raised its price target to $418 from $405. Tesla Inc. NASDAQ: TSLA stock has been on a roller coaster ride in 2025. That’s not new to long-time shareholders. However, it’s a reminder that the company’s greatest asset (i.e., the visionary leadership of Elon Musk) is also its greatest weakness. That’s because investors sold the stock (and, in some cases, their Tesla vehicles) in protest of Musk’s involvement with the Trump administration. They also felt that the chief executive officer (CEO) wasn’t spending enough time on the business. The reality is less clear. Tesla remains a leading player in the global electric vehicle market. However, demand is noticeably slowing, especially in China. That creates a challenge for TSLA stock. Despite the excitement around Tesla’s robotics and autonomous driving ventures, its EV business continues to be the main source of revenue and profit. Tesla stock is trading just below the consensus price of analysts that report to MarketBeat. It’s also trading right around its 50-day SMA, which has acted as both support and resistance for the stock at different times. Ratings and price targets are all over the map, but the company’s earnings on July 23 should bring some short-term clarity. After a strong run-up after last quarter’s strong earnings report, Netflix Inc. NASDAQ: NFLX stock is taking a breather. That’s not to say that the stock is giving off bearish vibes. It just looks like buyers are a little exhausted and looking for a reason to move the stock higher. That reason may come on July 17 when Netflix reports earnings. Some analysts believe there’s limited upside to NFLX stock at its current level. However, similar remarks were made when the stock was trading right around $1,000. If the company continues to deliver earnings growth around the 22% that analysts are forecasting, there’s no reason to believe the stock can’t push higher. Plus, although the company has not made it a priority, the stock is trading at a level where a stock split is a possibility. The company has split its stock twice, but not since a 7-for-1 split in 2015. For now, the company is focusing on content creation and international growth. However, at a price of over $1,200 per share, it will continue to be a source of speculation. Before you consider Netflix, you'll want to hear this.

"One Tech Tip: 'Click-to-cancel' is over, but there are other ways to unsubscribe",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/one-tech-tip-click-to-cancel-is-over-but-there-are-other-ways-to-unsubscribe-2025-07-11/,"NEW YORK (AP) — A “click-to-cancel” rule, which would have made it easier for consumers to end unwanted subscriptions, has been blocked by a federal appeals court days before it was set to go into effect. But there are ways to end those subscriptions and memberships, even if they take some work. The rule would also have required companies to disclose when free trials and promotional offers would end and let customers cancel recurring subscriptions as easily as they started them. But even without the new federal guidance, here are some ways to stay on top of subscription and membership fees. Experts at the Consumer Federation of America recommend setting calendar reminders for whenever a free trial period ends, to alert yourself to cancel promotional offers before the real recurring costs kick in. The auto-enrollment process, in which the company does not remind the consumer via email that a trial is about to end and higher monthly payments will begin, was also at the heart of the FTC's rule. “No subscription business model should be structured to profit from a gauntlet-style cancellation process,"" said Erin Witte, Director of Consumer Protection for the Consumer Federation of America, in a statement on the click-to-cancel rule. Regularly reviewing your credit card and debit card bills can also help you keep track of any recurring charges — including price increases you may have missed or that you didn't anticipate when trying out a new membership or subscription. “Companies make it easy for consumers to click to sign up and easy for the companies to automatically withdraw funds from consumers’ accounts,” said Shennan Kavanagh, Director of Litigation at the National Consumer Law Center (NCLC) in a statement on the FTC's click-to-cancel rule. “People should not (have to) spend months trying to cancel unwanted subscriptions.” Given the FTC's vacated rule, though, companies may still legally require that customers cancel memberships or subscriptions by phone, even as they permit signing up, enrolling, and paying bills online. Consumer advocates say this places an extra burden of time and energy on the consumer to stop an unwanted recurring fee, but sometimes knowing the terms of the subscription and getting on the phone is worth the trouble. Apps like Rocket Money and services like Trim, which is accessed through a browser, can keep track of your recurring monthly fees and subscriptions, for free — or for a fee — and can help you catch new ones or even unsubscribe from some services. For parents, especially, a service like Trim could help inform them that a child has started a new subscription, game or membership before the fees recur. And Rocket Money will actively work to end unwanted subscriptions for you, for a monthly price. If the company can't successfully end or cancel the subscription or membership, it will give the customer the information needed to do so. Trim also provides this service, in its premium form, for an additional fee. The FTC is currently moving forward with preparations for a trial involving Amazon’s Prime program, which accuses the retailer of enrolling consumers in its Prime program without their consent and making it difficult to cancel subscriptions. Often, when a consumer tries to cancel a subscription for something like Prime, which offers free delivery and streaming video, the company will offer a month or more of the subscription at a promotional rate — half off, or at other, better-seeming values, to entice a customer to stay. Staying strong in the face of what may appear to be a good deal can help you stop recurring monthly fees before you forget to cancel them again. Agreeing to yet another trial or promotional rate, which is another on-ramp to auto-enrollment, just continues the cycle, according to consumer advocates. The FTC's rule would have required businesses to obtain a customer’s consent before charging for memberships, auto-renewals and programs linked to free trials. The businesses would have also had to disclose when free trials and promotional offers would end. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit said this week that the FTC made a procedural error by failing to come up with a preliminary regulatory analysis, which is required for rules whose annual impact on the U.S. economy is more than $100 million. The FTC said that it did not have to come up with a preliminary regulatory analysis because it initially determined that the rule’s impact on the national economy would be less than $100 million. An administrative law judge decided that the economic impact would be more than the $100 million threshold, and the court decided to vacate the rule. Former President Joe Biden's administration had included the FTC’s proposal as part of its “Time is Money” initiative, which aimed to crack down on consumer-related hassles. —— “The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.
