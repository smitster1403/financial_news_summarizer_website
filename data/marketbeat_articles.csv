"Asian shares are mostly lower, while Tokyo's Nikkei jumps 2%",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/asian-shares-are-mostly-lower-while-tokyos-nikkei-jumps-2-2025-08-08/,"MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Asian shares were mostly lower Friday while Tokyo’s benchmark jumped more than 2% after Japanese officials said they had resolved questions over the tariff that will apply to exports to the U.S. The new U.S. tariffs on Japanese goods that took effect Thursday did not match an agreement between Washington and Tokyo on a 15% level, and Japan’s main trade envoy said the U.S. side had agreed to correct the problem. The Nikkei 225 in Tokyo gained 2.2% to 41,977.65 and is close to a record level. Toyota Motor Corp. jumped 3.9% and Honda Motor Co. was up 4%. Automakers are among the manufacturers with the most at stake regarding exports to the U.S. Elsewhere in Asia, most markets slipped following declines on Wall Street. Hong Kong's Hang Seng declined 0.7% to 24,916.15, while the Shanghai Composite index inched up less than 0.1% to 3,642.10. South Korea's Kospi slipped 0.7% to 3,206.86. In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 slipped 0.2% to 8,813.70. Taiwan's Taiex gained 0.2% and the Sensex in India was down 0.5%. “We’re heading into a stretch where markets will punish certainty. The momentum winds are shapeshifters—what looks like a slam dunk on Monday can turn into a face plant by Friday,” Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. On Thursday, the S&P 500 edged 0.1% lower and the Dow industrials dipped 0.5%. The Nasdaq composite rose 0.3% to a record as shares in Apple and some computer chip makers soared. Intel sank 3.1% after Trump called for its CEO to resign, while accusing him of being “highly CONFLICTED,” though he gave no evidence. But Apple rose 3.2% after its CEO Tim Cook joined Trump at the White House on Wednesday to say it’s increasing its investment in U.S. manufacturing by an additional $100 billion over the next four years. Computer chip makers with big investments or manufacturing capacity in the U.S. surged higher after Trump ordered 100% tariffs on imported semiconductors but said companies with big U.S. investments would be exempt. Shares in Advanced Micro Devices jumped 5.7% and Nvidia gained 0.8%. A worse-than-expected report on the U.S. jobs market last week added to worries that President Donald Trump's tariffs are damaging the economy. But hopes for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve and a torrent of stronger-than-expected profit reports from big U.S. companies are helping to offset those concerns. Lower interest rates can give the economy and investment prices a boost, though the downside is that they can also push inflation higher at a time when tariffs are also pushing prices up. The Bank of England  cut its main interest rate on Thursday in hopes of bolstering the sluggish U.K. economy. In other dealings early Friday, U.S. benchmark crude oil shed 10 cents to $63.78 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 6 cents to $66.37 per barrel The U.S. dollar rose to 147.16 Japanese yen from 147.13 yen. The euro slipped to $1.1660 from $1.1667. __ AP Business Writers Stan Choe and Matt Ott contributed. Before you consider Toyota Motor, you'll want to hear this.

Why Monolithic Power's Earnings and Guidance Ignited a Rally,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/why-monolithic-powers-earnings-and-guidance-ignited-a-rally/,"Following its July 31st earnings announcement, shares of Monolithic Power Systems NASDAQ: MPWR jumped more than 10% in a single session on unusually high trading volume. In the first few trading sessions of early August 2025, Monolitic Power’s stock price seemingly stabilized, holding on to an approximate 13% overall gain. Such a decisive move up in a company’s stock price is rarely arbitrary. In this case, it directly responded to a rock-solid quarterly report. More importantly, it was also a response to powerful forward-looking guidance that confirmed the company’s essential role in one of the technology sector’s most demanding and fastest-growing departments: The hardware infrastructure for artificial intelligence (AI). The results demonstrated accelerating business momentum, providing investors with a data-driven look into how the company is capitalizing on the insatiable energy needs of modern data centers. For investors, a company's ability not only to surpass past expectations but also to raise future forecasts is a strong bullish signal known as a beat and raise. It shows solid execution and management's confidence in the company's ongoing momentum. Monolithic Power delivered on both aspects in its second-quarter 2025 report. This impressive financial performance is tied directly to a fundamental technological shift. The immense computational power required for AI models has created a critical challenge in data centers: energy consumption. Modern AI accelerators, such as GPUs and custom ASICs, are highly power-hungry, generating significant heat and straining the power delivery infrastructure of even the most advanced facilities. This is where Monolithic Power Systems (MPS) has established a key advantage. During its earnings call, management provided the missing link for investors, confirming it had begun ""initial shipments of our power solutions to support our customers' new ASIC-based AI products."" This statement solidifies the company’s position as a direct beneficiary of the AI hardware buildout and provides context for the remarkable growth in its Storage & Computing business segment, which surged 70.0% year-over-year. MPS does not just sell components; it provides highly integrated and efficient power modules that solve this energy bottleneck. Its proprietary technology allows for higher power density, meaning more power can be delivered cleanly and efficiently in a smaller physical space. These solutions are mission-critical for data center operators trying to maximize computing power without overhauling their entire infrastructure, making MPS a key enabler of the entire AI ecosystem. Following the earnings release, Wall Street analysts were quick to validate the market's enthusiastic reaction. The strong results and optimistic guidance prompted a wave of positive revisions, reinforcing the company's bullish thesis. Firms including Citigroup, Stifel Nicolaus, and KeyCorp all raised their price targets on Monolithic Power Systems’ (MPS) shares, with many reiterating Buy or Outperform ratings. This chorus of approval from financial experts signals a growing belief that the company’s strategic execution is not only on point but accelerating, driven by the durable demand from the AI sector. This confidence is further reflected in the company's ownership structure. Over 93% of Monolithic Power's stock is currently being held by institutional investors. This high level of ownership by large financial entities, such as mutual funds and pension funds, indicates a deep and widespread conviction in the company’s long-term strategy and execution. It suggests that major investors who perform extensive due diligence see a sustainable growth path, providing a stable foundation for the company's strategic initiatives. Monolithic Power Systems' second-quarter performance was more than a strong earnings report; it confirmed a strategic success. The powerful combination of a definitive financial beat, firm forward guidance, and a direct link to the explosive growth in AI infrastructure provides a clear picture of a company firing on all cylinders. The market's decisive rally acknowledged this fundamental reality. While high growth expectations are often priced into technology stocks, the company delivered the data to back them up. The results signal a strategic inflection point where Monolithic Power is cementing its role as an essential supplier for the AI revolution, effectively turning the immense energy needs of the buildout into robust and accelerating financial growth.

Trump defends the US economy with charts after job reports showed warning signs,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-defends-the-us-economy-with-charts-after-job-reports-showed-warning-signs-2025-08-07/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump unexpectedly summoned reporters to the Oval Office on Thursday to present them with charts that he says show the U.S. economy is solid following a jobs report last week that raised red flags and led to the Republican firing the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Joining Trump to talk about the economy was Stephen Moore, a senior visiting fellow in economics at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, and the co-author of the 2018 book “ Trumponomics.” Flipping through a series of charts on an easel, Moore sought to elevate Trump's performance as president and diminish the economic track record of former President Joe Biden. Trump stood next to Moore and interjected with approvals. The moment in the Oval Office spoke to the president's hopes to reset the narrative of the U.S. economy. While the stock market has been solid, job growth has turned sluggish and inflationary pressures have risen in the wake of Trump imposing a vast set of new tariffs, which are taxes on imports. Moore said he phoned Trump because he put together some data that shows he was correct to dismiss Erika McEntarfer as the head of the BLS. He noted that’s because reports from the BLS had overestimated the number of jobs created during the last two years of Biden’s term by 1.5 million. “I think they did it purposely,” said Trump, who has yet to offer statistical evidence backing his theory. Revisions are a standard component of jobs reports and tend to be larger during periods of economic disruption. The economy has seldom conformed to the whims of any president, often presenting pictures that are far more mixed and nuanced than what can easily be sold to voters. Through the first seven months of this year, employers have added 597,000 jobs, down roughly 44% from the gains during the same period in 2024. The July jobs report showed that just 73,000 jobs were added last month, while the May and June totals were revised downward by 258,000. While Biden did face downward revisions on his job numbers, the economy added 2 million jobs in 2024 and 2.6 million in 2023. The fundamental challenge in Biden's economy was the jolt of inflation as the annual rate of the consumer price index hit a four-decade high in June 2022. That level of inflation left many households feeling as though groceries, gasoline, housing and other essentials were unaffordable, a sentiment that helped to return Trump to the White House in the 2024 election. There are signs of inflation heating back up under Trump because of his tariffs. On Thursday, Goldman Sachs estimated that the upcoming inflation report for July will show that consumer prices rose 3% over the past 12 months, which would be up from a 2.3% reading in April. Trump promised that he could galvanize a boom. And when nonpartisan data has indicated something closer to a muddle, he found an advocate in Moore, whom he nominated to serve as a Federal Reserve governor during his first term. Moore withdrew his name after facing pushback in the Senate. Moore said that through the first five months of Trump's second term in office that “the average median household income adjusted for inflation and for the average family in America, is already up $1,174.” Moore said his numbers are based on unpublished Census Bureau data, which can make them difficult to independently verify. “That’s an incredible number,” Trump said.

Closure of Midwest-based newspaper chain leaves dozens of communities without a news source,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/closure-of-midwest-based-newspaper-chain-leaves-dozens-of-communities-without-a-news-source-2025-08-07/,"SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) — Dozens of communities in the Midwest and West learned Thursday they had lost their newspapers after an Illinois-based publisher announced it would abruptly close because of financial problems. News Media Corp., which owns local newspapers across five states, said it will close 14 operations in Wyoming, seven in Illinois, five in Arizona, four in South Dakota and one in Nebraska. Touting itself as “the voice of small town America,” NMC's closure affects longtime newspapers that were often the primary source of news in numerous small towns, worsening the problem of news deserts in rural areas. The closure follows a decades-long pattern of financial challenges for local newspapers — the U.S. has lost over one-third of its print newspapers and two-thirds of its newspaper journalists since 2004 as the news media has struggled to adopt to a changing readership and revenue landscape, according to the Medill Local News Initiative at Northwestern University. “Unfortunately, due to financial challenges, a significant economic downturn impacting our industry, revenue losses and increasing expenses, and the recent failure of an attempt to sell the company as a going concern, we have reached a point where continuing business is no longer feasible,” company CEO J.J. Tompkins wrote in a letter to staff Wednesday. News Media Corp. is based in Rochelle, Illinois. Hundreds of employees were terminated immediately, and Tompkins wrote that the company will make “reasonable efforts to pay you all remaining compensation you have earned.” Staff took to social media to express their shock and disappointment at the news. “No one in Huron, nor any of the other papers, knew this was coming today,” Benjamin Chase, managing editor of the Huron Plainsman in South Dakota, said in a social media post. “We’re all in shock and attempting to figure out how to move forward.” Josh Linehan, managing editor of the Brookings Register in South Dakota, wrote in a letter to readers, “It’s no secret that it’s tough times out there for all print media, and we’re no exception."" He added, “But make no mistake — we’re closed for now as a result of poor corporate management.” News Media Corp. did not return a request for comment. Brookings Mayor Ope Niemeyer said the closure of his town’s newspaper “absolutely” leaves a big hole in the community. He said it’s devastating for the newspaper’s employees and disadvantages the city, County Commission and other local boards that used the newspaper for legal notices. Less than a year ago, Brookings lost the news on its local radio station, which left just the newspaper, now gone, he said. “Obviously we all have websites and Facebook and LinkedIn and Instagram and all that, but there’s a generation that doesn’t use that,” said Niemeyer, who at 65 prefers a printed newspaper. He liked the newspaper’s commentary for fostering conversations. The reporters did a great job telling readers what was going on in Brookings, a city of about 25,000 people, he said. “It brings the community together,” the mayor said. “It’s an entity that’s going to be irreplaceable.” The reasons behind newspaper closures are complex, with multiple factors at play, said Teri Finneman, a professor at the University of Kansas' journalism school and publisher of The Eudora Times. The newspaper industry is using a business model that is two centuries old and unsustainable in 2025, she said. The public also has greater reluctance to pay for local news, too few subscribers are paying too low rates and a lack of social cohesion in the U.S. has led to fracturing and mistrust in news, Finneman said. This has been coupled with declining populations in many rural areas and corporate ownership that often is unfamiliar with running such papers, she said. “This really needs to be a wake-up call to every town in this nation that your newspaper could be at risk as well and it is incumbent upon people to start supporting their newspapers through subscriptions and through advertising if we are going to keep critical news in these communities,” Finneman said. On Thursday, the Sioux Falls-based Dakota Scout newspaper said it plans to expand coverage in Brookings in response to the closures. ___ Dura reported from Bismarck, North Dakota.

"AppLovin’s Q2 Miss Spooks Market, But Wall Street Doubles Down",https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/applovins-q2-miss-spooks-market-but-wall-street-doubles-down/,"Over the past 52 weeks, AppLovin NASDAQ: APP has been one of the biggest stock market standouts. As of the Aug. 6 close, shares have surged by a whopping 446%. The company has an incredibly strong record of delivering impressive earnings. Shares have gained by 12% or more the day following its last six earnings releases. But, investors seemed to hit the panic button after seeing AppLovin’s Q2 2025 results, released on Aug. 6. Within minutes of the release, shares plunged around 13% in after-hours trading. However, as investors further digested the results and management commentary, worries subsided considerably. By 10 PM EST, shares were down 5.5% in extended trading. Then, in a massive shift, shares gained by more than 10% midday on Aug. 7 as the rest of the market provided its take on the results. So, what are the key details from AppLovin’s earnings, and what is the outlook for this gangbusters stock going forward? Let’s dive in to get to the bottom of these questions. Note that the company’s Q2 results only consider its advertising segment. On June 30, AppLovin sold its Apps business and excludes its results from the Q2 report. In Q2, AppLovin reported revenues of approximately $1.26 billion, an increase of 77% versus Q2 2024. According to MarketBeat estimates, this figure fell short of the $1.37 billion Wall Street was looking for. Notably, that 77% rate was the highest growth figure the company’s advertising business posted over the past five quarters. The company’s bottom-line results were a different story. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) came in at $2.26, substantially higher than the $2.05 estimate. The figure marked a massive 163% spike versus the prior year's quarter. The company’s guidance for Q3 also came in moderately better than expected. AppLovin’s sale of its Apps segment drove one of its key intended results: massively lifting the margins of the overall business. AppLovin achieved an EBITDA margin of 81%, compared to 67.7% in Q1 2025 when the company included the Apps business in the results. AppLovin also posted an incredible free cash flow margin of just under 61%. Excluding the Apps business, this gives the firm a last-12-months free cash flow margin of 66%. That’s the highest figure of any large-cap U.S. stock in the software industry over that period. It’s also higher than any stock in the Magnificent Seven. AppLovin dominates advertising in mobile gaming, but it sees huge potential in the much larger e-commerce market. Last quarter, the firm provided the first key data around its e-commerce push, stating that it had achieved an annual run rate of $1 billion with around 600 customers. In Q2, AppLovin didn’t provide any new numbers around the e-commerce push, which likely disappointed investors initially. However, it did provide key details on why that was the case and clarified the timeline going forward. AppLovin said it intentionally constrained the advertiser onboarding process in e-commerce to make its product better. The stock’s price action on Aug. 7 shows that although this wasn’t the best news, it certainly wasn’t a reason for investors to panic. AppLovin is entering a massive new market. To achieve sustained success, making sure its product is high-quality is much more important than moving quickly. The company said it plans to begin onboarding again on Oct. 1. However, new customers will require a referral from an existing customer to join, meaning the rollout will still be somewhat measured. A full rollout will begin in the first half of 2026. Based on this information, investors might not get a huge amount of new data on AppLovin’s e-commerce push until its Q1 2026 earnings release. The company says it is less than 1% penetrated in e-commerce in terms of the number of advertisers it works with. This highlights the huge opportunity it has going forward. Overall, AppLovin didn’t announce anything groundbreaking in Q2. Thus, for a stock that has risen so much, it wasn’t surprising to see shares fall after-hours. However, its enormous e-commerce opportunity still remains, and analysts are bullish on the stock. Morgan Stanley and Piper Sandler raised their price targets to $480 and $500, respectively, on Aug. 7. These numbers imply significant upside potential in shares going forward. They highlight how AppLovin could experience strong gains in 2026 if its e-commerce business really takes off. Before you consider AppLovin, you'll want to hear this.

"How major US stock indexes fared Thursday, 8/7/2025",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/how-major-us-stock-indexes-fared-thursday-872025-2025-08-07/,"U.S. stocks drifted to a mixed finish as President Donald Trump’s tariffs on dozens of countries had only a muted effect on markets worldwide. The S&P 500 slipped 0.1% Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.5%, and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.3%. Worries are high that Trump’s tariffs are damaging the economy, particularly after last week’s worse-than-expected report on the job market. But hopes for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve and a torrent of stronger-than-expected profit reports from big U.S. companies are helping to offset the concerns, at least for now. Treasury yields ticked higher. On Thursday: The S&P 500 fell 5.06 points, or 0.1%, to 6,340. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 224.48 points, or 0.5%, to 43,968.64. The Nasdaq composite rose 73.27 points, or 0.3%, to 21,242.70. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 6.57 points, or 0.3%, to 2,214.72. For the week: The S&P 500 is up 101.99 points, or 1.6%. The Dow is up 380.06 points, or 0.9%. The Nasdaq is up 592.56 points, or 2.9%. The Russell 2000 is up 47.94 points, or 2.2%. For the year: The S&P 500 is up 458.37 points, or 7.8%. The Dow is up 1,424.42 points, or 3.3%. The Nasdaq is up 1,931.90 points, or 10%. The Russell 2000 is down 15.44 points, or 0.7%.

Microsoft Stock Gains as Analysts Boost Price Targets,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/microsoft-stock-gains-as-analysts-boost-price-targets/,"Microsoft Corporation NASDAQ: MSFT delivered an earnings report that can be considered a blowout, even for a mega-cap company with high expectations. Microsoft beat on revenue and earnings and reiterated its guidance for data center spending for the remainder of the 2025 calendar year. Analysts have taken notice. The Microsoft analyst forecasts on MarketBeat show that nearly two dozen analysts have either reiterated or raised their price target for MSFT stock. Many of the new targets are above the consensus price of $609.86, which is a 15% gain from the stock’s price on August 6. August is a tricky month for investors. Apart from a few names like NVIDIA, the major technology stocks have already reported. The economy continues to give off conflicting signals, and Congress is out on recess, which generally leads to a less active market. This is a good reminder of why buying the best matters. In the tech sector, that means Microsoft. The company’s stock has been up about 2.8% since the earnings report, but that’s down from the 5% gain it had before a slight pullback this week. Earnings reports provide a snapshot of a company’s performance. However, the headline numbers are lagging indicators. In other words, they tell what’s happened in the past. What a company has to say about the current and future quarters can drive up a stock price. For a mega-cap company like Microsoft, that usually comes down to its earnings outlook. Analysts project Microsoft to post 12.3% earnings growth in the next 12 months. That compares favorably to another mega-cap hyperscaler, Meta Platforms Inc. NASDAQ: META, which analysts project to post 13.15% earnings growth. That aligns with the company’s guidance for “double-digit earnings growth on a constant currency basis.” However, it also means that analysts are slightly more bullish about earnings expectations for Microsoft, which largely explains the outlook for 15% stock price growth. Microsoft emphasized that its projected future growth will be driven by continued investment in AI and cloud infrastructure, improving operating leverage, and disciplined expense management. That aligns with Dan Ives' sentiment. The Wedbush analyst continues to be bullish on the tech sector, specifically the Magnificent Seven stocks that will lead the AI revolution. Ives and his team believe that the market is not fully appreciating the amount of spending that will be needed over the next three years. Wedbush lists Microsoft, Meta Platforms, NVIDIA, Tesla, and Palantir as its top five tech stocks for the second half of 2025. That bullish outlook comes with a price target of $625, up from $600. However, Wedbush isn’t the most bullish on MSFT stock. That would be Brent Thill from Jefferies Financial Group. The analyst raised his price target for Microsoft to $675 from $600. MSFT stock continues to be in a sustained uptrend. The 20-day simple moving average (SMA), currently around $513.61, is serving as a reliable short-term support level. Price action remains above the 20-day SMA and within the upper range of the Bollinger Bands, signaling strength and proximity to potential overbought conditions. The MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) shows a slight bullish crossover, with the MACD line (10.45) above the signal line (9.94), suggesting upward momentum could continue. However, there may be limited strength behind the move.  One reason is the relative strength indicator (RSI), which, at 64, suggests that MSFT is approaching overbought territory. However, there may still be room for modest upside before a possible pullback or consolidation. Another potential short-term concern is lighter volume after the post-earnings surge. That’s not a bearish signal but could signal that momentum is slowing. Before you consider Microsoft, you'll want to hear this.

Trump to nominate top economic aide Stephen Miran to Federal Reserve board,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-to-nominate-top-economic-aide-stephen-miran-to-federal-reserve-board-2025-08-07/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Thursday he will nominate a top economic adviser to the Federal Reserve’s board of governors for four months, temporarily filling a vacancy while continuing his search for a longer-term appointment. Trump said he has named Stephen Miran, the chair of the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers, to fill a seat vacated by governor Adriana Kugler, a Biden appointee who is stepping down Friday. Miran, if approved by the Senate, will serve until January 31, 2026. The appointment is Trump’s first opportunity to exert more control over the Fed, one of the few remaining independent federal agencies. Trump has relentlessly criticized the current chair, Jerome Powell, for keeping short-term interest rates unchanged, calling him “a stubborn MORON” last week on social media. Miran has been a major defender of Trump’s income tax cuts and tariff hikes, arguing that the combination will generate enough economic growth to reduce budget deficits. He also has played down the risk of Trump’s tariffs generating higher inflation, a major source of concern for Powell. The choice of Miran may heighten concerns about political influence over the Fed, which has traditionally been insulated from day-to-day politics. Fed independence is generally seen as key to ensuring that it can take difficult steps to combat inflation, such as raising interest rates, that politicians might be unwilling to take. Federal Reserve governors vote on all the central bank’s interest-rate decisions, as well as its financial regulatory policies. Miran’s nomination, if approved, would add a near-certain vote in support of lower interest rates. Kugler had echoed Powell’s view that the Fed should keep rates unchanged and further evaluate the impact of tariffs on the economy before making any moves. Trump has said he will appoint Fed officials who will cut interest rates, which he says will reduce the borrowing costs of the federal government’s huge $36 trillion debt pile. Trump also wants lower rates to boost moribund home sales, which have been held back partly by higher mortgage costs. Yet the Fed doesn’t directly set longer-term interest rates for things like home and car purchases. At its most recent meeting last week, Fed officials kept their key rate unchanged at 4.3%, where it has stood after three rate cuts late last year. But two Fed governors — Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman — dissented from that decision. Both were appointed by Trump in his first term. Still, even with Miran on the board, 12 Fed officials vote on interest rate policy and many remain concerned that Trump's sweeping tariffs could push inflation higher in the coming months. Miran could be renominated to a longer term on the Fed once his initial appointment is concluded, or replaced by another nominee. Powell’s term as chair ends in May 2026. Yet, Powell could remain on the board of governors until January 2028, even after he steps down as chair. That would deny, or at least delay, an opportunity for Trump to appoint an additional policymaker to the Fed’s board. As a result, one option for Trump is to appoint Powell’s eventual replacement as chair to replace Kugler once the remaining four months of her term are completed. Leading candidates for that position include Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor from 2006 to 2011 and frequent critic of Powell’s chairmanship, and Kevin Hassett, another top Trump economic adviser. Another option for the White House next May would be to select Waller, who is already on the board, to replace Powell, and who has been widely mentioned as a candidate. Marco Casiraghi, senior economist at investment bank Evercore ISI, noted that the choice of Miran could be a positive sign for Waller, because Trump did not take the opportunity to nominate someone likely to become chair once Powell steps down. After the July jobs report was released last Friday, Miran criticized the Fed chair for not cutting benchmark interest rates, saying that Trump had been proven correct on inflation during his first term and would be again. The president has pressured Powell to cut short-term interest rates under the belief that his tariffs will not fuel higher inflationary pressures. “What we’re seeing now in real time is a repetition once again of this pattern where the president will end up having been proven right,” Miran said on MSNBC. “And the Fed will, with a lag and probably quite too late, eventually catch up to the president’s view.” Last year, Miran expressed support for some unconventional economic views in commentaries on the Fed and international economics. Last November, he proposed measures that would reduce the value of the dollar in order to boost exports, reduce imports and cut the U.S. trade deficit, a top priority for Trump. He also suggested tariffs could push U.S. trading partners, such as the European Union and Japan, to accept a cheaper dollar as part of a “Mar-a-Lago Accord,” an echo of the Plaza Accord reached in the 1980s that lowered the dollar's value. As a fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute, Miran in March 2024 also proposed overhauling the Fed's governance, including by making it easier for a president to fire members of its board of governors. “The Fed’s current governance has facilitated groupthink that has led to significant monetary-policy errors,” Miran wrote in a paper with Dan Katz, now a top official at the Treasury Department. ___ Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

Trump orders federal regulators to probe alleged bank discrimination against conservatives,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-orders-federal-regulators-to-probe-alleged-bank-discrimination-against-conservatives-2025-08-07/,"NEW YORK (AP) — President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order mandating a probe into whether banks have discriminated against conservatives and certain industries like gun manufacturers and cryptocurrency companies, invoking the vast powers to go after entities that the Republican president alleges have discriminated against him and his allies. The executive order deals with an issue known as “debanking,” which is when banks close accounts of individuals or declines to go into business with certain industries. Trump has accused JPMorgan and Bank of America of debanking him and his companies in the past, something both banks have denied. Trump ordered federal bank regulators to make sure banks do not discriminate against individuals or companies for their political or religious beliefs. He also ordered bank regulators to probe when banks may have allegedly discriminated and refer the cases to the Department of Justice within 120 days. The move could open banks to potential civil or criminal investigations, fines or other punishments. When Trump and his party discuss debanking, they typically refer to banks closing the accounts of a person or company when they no longer want to do business with them. Banks usually say they close accounts or deny loans because the person or business is deemed too risky. The banking industry has long argued that it has a constitutional right to choose whom they go into business with, if it does not violate laws like the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. Th act, which was part of several pieces of legislation signed during the Civil Rights Movement, bans banks from discrimination based on race, ethnicity, religion, sex and other protected statuses. Another type of debanking is when government regulators tell banks to avoid doing business with industries or individuals. Democratic President Barack Obama’s Department of Justice told banks to avoid doing business with “high risk” industries, which included payday lenders and firearms manufacturers. This type of government-directed debanking is also known as reputational risk, where the historic reputation of an industry prompts banks to be more careful about banking and lending. Historic examples include entities who did business in high-risk countries, did business largely in cash or were repeatedly flagged by bank regulators. Under the executive order, bank regulators will need to remove reputational risk from their metrics on how they measure a bank's safety and soundness. Banks, who have benefited from Trumps deregulation agenda and prefer simpler rules and regulations, have tried to strike a cordial tone with the administration, showing themselves as willing brokers who got caught up in a difficult political environment. “It’s in banks’ best interest to take deposits, lend to and support as many customers as possible. Unfortunately, regulatory overreach, supervisory discretion and a maze of obscure rules have stood in the way as the (executive order) makes clear,” the major bank lobby groups said Thursday in a joint statement. Conservatives have argued that reputational risk has become an umbrella term that allows banks to discriminate. The banking industry insists it does not actively debank and does not target specific industries or individuals. The banking industry itself, knowing that reputational risk has become liability, has already been removing any mention of reputational risk from their policies and procedures, particularly since Trump returned to the White House. “Today’s Executive Order helps ensure all consumers and businesses are treated fairly, a goal the nation’s banks share with the Administration,” the banks said. For Trump, the issue of debanking is deeply personal. Trump, in a wide-ranging interview on CNBC, earlier this week alleged that two major banks — JPMorgan and Bank of America — cut him off after he left office in 2021. “They totally discriminate against ... me maybe even more, but they discriminated against many conservatives,” he said to CNBC. Both banks have denied they debanked Trump. “We don’t close accounts for political reasons, and we agree with President Trump that regulatory change is desperately needed,” said a spokeswoman for JPMorgan Chase in a statement. Former bank regulators have argued that reputational risk, when used along with other metrics, can be a good measure of how well a bank is operating. Banks who end up doing business with companies with a history of violating laws, or violating anti-money laundering rules, can be at risk for failure. Signature Bank failed in 2023 partly because of its exposure to cryptocurrency companies during a major downturn in crypto assets. Credit Suisse in 2009 paid half a billion dollars to regulators for laundering money on behalf of Iran. “Financial risk, and reputational risk, can be intertwined,” said Graham Steele, a former Treasury Department official who also served as a Democratic Congressional staffer on banking issues. The Obama administration's government-directed debanking has been a rallying cry for conservatives. It’s one reason why the cryptocurrency industry backed Trump in 2024. While the Biden administration did not explicitly force banks to debank the crypto industry, Democratic President Joe Biden’s bank regulators did express some public concern about it, a move that was read by banks as a reason to steer away from crypto. That phrasing by the Biden administration was often referred to as “Operation Choke Point 2.0” by Trump and his allies. Republicans have introduced legislation to cut down on alleged acts of debanking as well. Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, chair of the Senate Banking Committee, has introduced legislation that would require bank regulators to no longer consider reputational risk as a factor in how they measure a bank’s health and risk profile. “Debanking federally legal businesses and law-abiding citizens is un-American, and President Trump’s Executive Order is a critical step towards protecting Americans’ access to financial services,” Scott said in a statement.

Trump opens the door for private equity and crypto as 401(k) retirement plan options,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-opens-the-door-for-private-equity-and-crypto-as-401k-retirement-plan-options-2025-08-07/,"NEW YORK (AP) — Millions of Americans saving for retirement through 401(k) accounts could have the option of putting their money in higher-risk private equity and cryptocurrency investments, according to an executive order signed Thursday by President Donald Trump that could give those financial players long-sought access to a pool of funds worth trillions. There is no immediate change in how people invest part of their work earnings. Federal agencies would need to rewrite rules and regulations to allow the expanded choices, and that would take months or more to complete. But once done, employers could offer a broader array of mutual funds and investments to workers, according to the White House. New plans could invest in alternative assets, particularly private equity, cryptocurrencies and real estate. The Republican president's order directs the Labor Department and other agencies to redefine what would be considered a qualified asset under 401(k) retirement rules. Americans' retirement plans are governed by a law known as the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, better known as ERISA. Employers are required by law to offer retirement options that are in the best interest of their employees, not Wall Street. Most retirement plans for Americans are made up of stock and bond investments, and to a much lesser extent, cash and heavily traded commodities such as gold. Trump's move rewards both the $5 trillion private equity industry, which for decades has wanted to compete for a role in retirement plans, and the cryptocurrency industry, whose executives strongly supported Trump’s 2024 campaign as they aimed for more mainstream acceptance among Americans. The price of bitcoin was up 2% on Thursday to $116,542 and has nearly doubled since Trump was elected. Under Democratic President Joe Biden, federal regulators were to treat cryptocurrency investments with “extreme care” because of the extreme volatility of crypto. It is not uncommon for bitcoin, ethereum and other big cryptocurrencies to move up or down 10% in a single day, whereas a 2% or 3% single-day move in the stock market would be considered historic. For cryptocurrency companies, which donated millions to Trump’s campaign as well as his inauguration, one goal was to get their industry qualified under ERISA. Coinbase, one of the largest crypto companies in the United States, was also a major donor toward Trump’s military parade in Washington this summer. Under Trump, the Securities and Exchange Commission dropped its lawsuit against Coinbase, where the Biden administration said crypto should be treated as a security. Crypto is particularly popular among young Americans. While volatile, bitcoin has generally moved upward since it was created by an anonymous programmer nearly 20 years ago. “It was inevitable that bitcoin would make its way into American 401(k)'s,” said Cory Klippsten, the CEO of Swan Bitcoin. “As fiduciaries realize bitcoin’s risk-adjusted upside over the long term, we’ll see growing allocations, especially from younger, tech-savvy workers who want hard money, not melting ice cubes.” Private equity firms rely heavily on high-net-worth individuals and state and private pension plans, which have extremely long investment timelines. But having access to Americans' retirement assets would open up a deep pool of cash. Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman has told investors going back to at least 2017 that it was a “dream” of his and the industry to be able to draw upon these retirement assets. Previous administrations, Republican and Democrat, have agreed that private equity investments, which can be riskier, more expensive and less liquid than traditional stock and bond market mutual funds, should not be included in 401(k) plans. The average historic annual return on private equity assets going back to 1990 is roughly 13%, net of fees, according to Cambridge Associates. The S&P 500 index has had an approximate annual return, including dividends, of roughly 10.6% in the same period of time. However, private equity assets tend to be locked up for years, because the companies underlying the assets have to be sold on the private market, making them highly illiquid compared to stocks, which can be sold in a day. “We look forward to working with the Trump Administration on a thoughtful framework that expands access to alternatives for retirement savers, offering Americans more diversification and investment options with appropriate investor guardrails,” said Bryan Corbett, the president and CEO of the Managed Funds Association, which is the trade group for the private equity industry. Even after the regulations are written, it will take time for major retirement plan companies, such as Fidelity, Vanguard, T. Rowe Price, and others, to develop appropriate funds for employers to use. Employers are unlikely to revise their retirement plan options quickly, so it may take several years before crypto and private equity investments become mainstream in an individual’s retirement plan. “While Vanguard has not committed to launching a product for defined contribution plans, Vanguard is dedicated to educating retirement investors to ensure a clear understanding of the opportunities and risks of investing in private assets,” the company said in a statement. ___ Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

Constellation Energy’s Earnings Beat Signals a New Era,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/constellation-energys-earnings-beat-signals-a-new-era/,"Constellation Energy NASDAQ: CEG delivered a solid second-quarter earnings report on Aug. 7, beating analyst estimates and reinforcing its crucial role in the digital economy. This strong performance is the latest chapter in a compelling story that has sent its stock soaring over 87% in the past year. The company's strategy is clear and potent: leverage its vast, carbon-free nuclear fleet to satisfy the immense energy appetite of the artificial intelligence (AI) and data center industries. While Constellation’s forward outlook has rarely been brighter, the stock's remarkable rally has pushed its valuation to new heights, leading investors to ask a critical question: Is the immense potential of AI already built into Constellation Energy’s share price? The AI revolution runs on electricity, and it requires massive amounts of reliable, 24/7 baseline power. As technology companies also face mounting pressure to meet sustainability goals, the demand for clean, firm energy has skyrocketed. This market dynamic has created a perfect storm for Constellation, whose nuclear fleet, the largest in the U.S., is uniquely positioned to deliver this exact product. Recent achievements provide compelling evidence of this strategy in action: While Constellation's growth prospects are exciting, its investment profile is anchored by powerful financial and policy guardrails that mitigate risk. The most significant of these is the federal nuclear Production Tax Credit (PTC). Solidified with strong bipartisan support, the PTC program provides a government-backed revenue floor for the company's nuclear fleet through 2032. This policy offers exceptional earnings stability and insulates the company’s foundational business from the volatility of commodity markets, giving investors a rare degree of confidence and visibility. This policy backstop is paired with strong financial discipline. Constellation maintains an investment-grade balance sheet with a healthy debt-to-equity ratio (D/E) of 0.79. Furthermore, management is actively signaling its confidence in future cash flows through shareholder-friendly actions. In the second quarter, the company initiated a $400 million accelerated share repurchase program and has publicly committed to a 10% dividend increase for 2025. This combination of a federal safety net and prudent capital management creates a reinforced foundation that supports the company’s ambitious growth strategy. After its meteoric rise, Constellation no longer carries the valuation of a typical utility sector company. Trading at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of approximately 35x, the stock commands a significant premium over its sector peers. This high valuation is the central debate for investors today. The argument for the premium is that Constellation has transcended its traditional utility classification. The market is increasingly viewing it as a critical AI infrastructure provider, an indispensable part of the digital supply chain. Much like a data center REIT that owns the physical buildings or a semiconductor firm that makes the chips, Constellation provides the essential resource that powers the entire ecosystem. From this perspective, its valuation is being benchmarked against high-growth technology enablers, not slow-and-steady power companies. This view is gaining traction on Wall Street. While the average analyst price target of $309.29 has been eclipsed by the stock’s rapid appreciation, high-end targets now reach $390. This indicates that some analysts believe the re-rating is justified and that there is still significant upside as the company continues to execute on its AI-driven strategy. Constellation Energy has masterfully positioned itself at the intersection of the clean energy transition and the AI revolution. Its second-quarter results are powerful evidence that the company’s strategy is working. The company has a clear growth runway, powered by durable demand from the world’s largest technology firms and fortified by supportive government policy. The primary challenge for investors now is the stock's valuation, which has already baked in a tremendous amount of future success. Therefore, the focus shifts to continued, flawless execution. The upcoming closing of the Calpine acquisition and the announcement of new data center contracts will be critical milestones for validating and ultimately growing into the premium valuation the market has awarded Constellation Energy.

EPA cancels $7 billion Biden-era grant program to boost solar energy,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/epa-cancels-7-billion-biden-era-grant-program-to-boost-solar-energy-2025-08-07/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday terminated a $7 billion grant program intended to help pay for residential solar projects for more than 900,000 lower-income U.S. households, in the latest Trump administration move hindering the nation’s shift to cleaner energy. The funding, part of the Biden-era's Solar for All program, was awarded to 60 recipients including states, tribes and regions for investments such as rooftop solar and community solar gardens. Solar, a renewable energy, is widely regarded as a way to introduce cleaner power onto the electrical grid and lower energy bills for American consumers. Under Republican President Donald Trump, officials have pursued dozens of deregulatory measures related to federal rules intended to protect clean air and water. Last week, the EPA proposed rescinding the agency’s “endangerment finding” which serves as the scientific and legal basis for regulating planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions. The administration has taken steps to bolster fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas as it pursues American ""energy dominance in the global market. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement on social media that authority for the solar program was eliminated under the tax-and-spending law signed by Trump last month. It eliminated the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, approved under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, that set aside $20 billion for community development projects to boost renewable energy and an additional $7 billion for the solar program. “The bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,″ Zeldin said. “Today, the Trump EPA is announcing that we are ending Solar for All for good, saving US taxpayers ANOTHER $7 BILLION!” Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt, who introduced the Solar for All program to cut electric bills for working families, said Zeldin’s action was illegal. “Solar for All means lower utility bills, many thousands of good-paying jobs and real action to address the existential threat of climate change,″ Sanders said in a statement. ”At a time when working families are getting crushed by skyrocketing energy costs and the planet is literally burning, sabotaging this program isn’t just wrong — it’s absolutely insane. We will fight back to preserve this enormously important program.” Only $53 million of the $7 billion awarded has been spent, according to a tally by the research firm Atlas Public Policy. Several grant recipients this week said their programs were in planning phases. Stephanie Bosh, senior vice president of the Solar Energy Industries Association, said the EPA has no legal authority to terminate grants already appropriated by Congress. “These grants are delivering billions of dollars of investment to red and blue states alike,″ she said. Bosh said solar was one of the cheapest energy sources at a time of growing demand for electricity. “This administration is continuing to dig itself into a hole,” she said. The EPA has argued that the tax and policy law allows the agency to rescind the money it has already obligated. The recipients of that money disagree, saying the bulk of the money had already been disbursed and is not affected by the law. Southern Environmental Law Center litigation director Kym Meyer said if the administration wants to move forward with canceling Solar for All funds, “we will see them in court.” Grant recipients have already challenged the administration’s actions, and a judge ruled in April the EPA cannot freeze the contracts. Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, the top Democrat on the Senate Environment Committee, called Zeldin’s elimination of the solar program a betrayal “that will further hike electricity costs and make our power grid less reliable.” “Trump is — yet again — putting his fossil fuel megadonors first,” he added. ___ St. John reported from Detroit. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

France’s top court strikes down pesticide clause in farming law,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/frances-top-court-strikes-down-pesticide-clause-in-farming-law-2025-08-07/,"PARIS (AP) — France’s highest court on Thursday blocked a key part of a contentious farming law that would have brought back a banned pesticide. The court said that the measure failed to protect the environment and future generations. The rest of the law — known as the “Duplomb law,” after the senator who proposed it — was allowed to stand. The bill, passed in early July, aimed to loosen rules for farmers and fast-track projects like water storage. It was backed by the government and major farming unions, but met fierce opposition from scientists, health experts and green groups. At the heart of the outrage was acetamiprid, a pesticide banned in France since 2018 for its role in harming bees and other pollinators. Farmers, especially sugar beet growers, had pushed for its return. But the court ruled that the proposal wasn't strict enough, and ignored France’s constitutional commitment to environmental protection. The backlash was swift and widespread. A student-led petition against the law drew more than 2 million signatures — one of the biggest in French history. Opponents said that the bill was rushed through parliament with barely any debate, and warned that it put public health and biodiversity at risk. The ruling is a blow to President Emmanuel Macron’s government, which had defended the bill until the end. Critics called the decision a win for democracy and the planet. Some lawmakers have already vowed to push for a full repeal in the coming months. Acetamiprid is currently approved by the European Union until 2033, and authorized in other member countries.

What US consumers can expect from new tariffs on imported goods,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/what-us-consumers-can-expect-from-new-tariffs-on-imported-goods-2025-08-07/,"American businesses and consumers soon will have a better idea of how President Donald Trump's foreign trade agenda might affect them now that the United States has imposed higher tariffs on products from dozens of countries. It’s been nearly 100 years since the nation had an overall import tax rate as high as the one set Thursday. But the individual impact on business costs and consumer prices could vary as much as the tariffs applied to goods of nearly 70 U.S. trading partners, from complicated economies like the European Union to the small African nation of Lesotho. Exports from a majority of them are getting taxed at 15%. For a handful of countries in Asia, the rate is 19%. Products from the rest are subject to taxes of 20% to 50%. Meanwhile, a 55% tariff on Chinese-made goods is scheduled to take effect next week if a U.S.-China trade deal is not agreed on before then. Businesses in the U.S. and abroad have been dealing in various ways since February with Trump's fluctuating tariffs on specific products and countries. Many automakers appeared to have absorbed the costs for now. But recent government data indicated that retail prices for groceries, furniture and appliances started creeping up in June. Because tariffs are a tax on imports, economists have expected U.S. consumers to foot at least part of the bill eventually. The country-specific round enforced Thursday, together with the president's earlier tariffs on specific sectors such as automobiles and steel, will increase prices 1.8% in the short term, the Budget Lab at Yale estimated. That’s the equivalent of a $2,400 loss of income per U.S. household, according to the non-partisan policy research center The projections were based on an analysis of duties implemented this year through Wednesday, as well as a doubling of the levy on items made in India that Trump said would be implemented near the end of August. ""Retailers have been able to hold the line on pricing so far, but the new increased tariffs will significantly raise costs for U.S. retailers, manufacturers and consumers,” Jon Gold, vice president of supply chain and customs policy at the National Retail Federation trade group, said in an emailed statement to The Associated Press. Here’s what to know about the tariffs and where U.S. consumers are most likely to notice effects: Trump unveiled sweeping import taxes on goods coming into the U.S. from 66 countries, the European Union, Taiwan and the Falkland Islands in April. He said the “reciprocal” tariffs were meant to boost domestic manufacturing and restore fairness to global trade. The president paused the country-specific tariffs a week later but applied a 10% tax to most imports. In early July, he began notifying countries that their exports would be subject to higher tariffs on Aug. 1 unless they reached trade deals. A week ago, he pushed the start date to Thursday. In the meantime, Trump announced a 35% tariff on imports from Canada, but delayed action on Mexico while negotiations continued. However, a free trade agreement reached with Mexico and Canada during Trump's first term shields most of those countries' products from punishing duties. The president also ordered a 50% tariff on goods from Brazil. This week, he signed an executive order to take India's tariff rate from 25% to 50% for its purchases of Russian oil. The timing gives India and Russia a chance to negotiate with the Trump administration. Other duties not specific to countries remain in place, such as a 50% tariff on imported aluminum and steel announced in June. Trump also threatened 100% tariffs on computer chips that aren’t made in the U.S. The administration has said tariffs are still coming on imported pharmaceutical drugs. The U.S. Commerce Department reported on July 31 that prices rose 2.6% in June, up from an annual pace of 2.4% in May. Earlier in July, the government reported that its primary inflation measure, the Consumer Price Index, also ticked higher in June as the cost of furniture, toys and other frequently imported items increased. Shoppers should be prepared to pay more for clothes and shoes because the combined tariffs “disproportionately affect clothing and textiles,” according to the Budget Lab at Yale. It estimates that shoe prices will go up 39% temporarily and stay 19% above where they are now. For apparel, the Budget Lab put the comparable figures at 37% and 18%. Overall, Americans face an average tax of 18.6% for imported products, the highest rate since 1933, the research center said. The tariffs will almost certainly result in higher food prices, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Foundation. The U.S. simply doesn't make enough of some products, like bananas or coffee, to satisfy demand. Fish, beer and liquor are also likely to get more expensive, the foundation said. The U.S. Wine Trade Alliance and other alcohol industry trade groups sent a letter to Trump that warned a 15% tariff on European wines and spirits could result in more than 25,000 American job losses and cost the industry nearly $2 billion in lost sales. “Mr. President, we need toasts, not tariffs, as we head into the most important season for our industry,” read the letter dated Wednesday. Wine distributors and retailers avoided price increases before now by accelerating shipments from France and other EU countries earlier in the year. But with the EU's tariff rate raised to 15% on Thursday, customers may see European wines costing 30% more in September, U.S. Wine Trade Alliance President Ben Aneff said. Some automakers already raised prices to counteract tariffs. Luxury sports car maker Ferrari said last week it was waiting for more details of Trump's trade deal with the EU before scaling back a 10% surcharge it put on most vehicles in the U.S. For the most part, automakers waited for details instead of passing on tariff costs to consumers. But that could change. General Motors said on July 22 that the impact of the tariffs could get more pronounced in the third quarter of the year. GM has estimated the tariffs will cost it $4 billion to $5 billion this year. Toyota reported Thursday a 37% drop in profits in the April-June quarter, cutting its full-year earnings forecasts largely because of Trump’s tariffs. Even with so many new tariffs kicking in, the tariff situation remains fluid. Trump’s use of an emergency powers law to implement tariffs is being challenged in the courts. The case is expected to wind up before the U.S. Supreme Court. Moreover, the tariffs on goods from China haven't been finalized. Consumers may start seeing more effects when the administration ends a tax exemption for small parcels sent from other countries. Trump last week signed an order to suspend the “de minimis"" exemption that has allowed shipments valued at $800 or less to enter the U.S. duty-free. International e-commerce companies have widely used the rule to avoid paying customs charges. Trump withdrew the exemption in early April for goods shipped from China and Hong Kong tariff-free. It is now set to be eliminated for low-value packages from every country on Aug. 29. ___ AP reporter Colleen Barry in Milan contributed to this report.

"Paramount and Skydance close their $8 billion merger, kicking off reign of new entertainment giant",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/paramount-and-skydance-close-their-8-billion-merger-kicking-off-reign-of-new-entertainment-giant-2025-08-07/,"NEW YORK (AP) — Skydance and Paramount officially closed their $8 billion merger on Thursday — kicking off the reign of a new entertainment giant after a contentious, over year-long endeavor to get the transaction over the finish line. The new company — which will trade under the “PSKY” ticker on Wall Street — brings Paramount's legacy Hollywood footprint, major TV networks like CBS and MTV, streaming services and more under the roof of a new power player: billionaire Skydance founder David Ellison. “Today marks an exciting and pivotal moment as we prepare to bring Paramount’s legacy as a Hollywood institution into the future of entertainment,"" Ellison, who is now Chairman and CEO of Paramount, a Skydance Corporation, said in a statement. He added that he aims to “honor exceptional storytelling while modernizing how we make and deliver content."" The merger's close came just two weeks after it received regulatory approval from the Trump administration. While now a done deal, the path towards that approval was far from smooth sailing. Months of scrutiny and turmoil surrounded the transaction — particularly amid President Donald Trump’s legal battle with “60 Minutes,” the crown jewel of Paramount-owned broadcast network CBS. With the specter of the Trump administration potentially blocking the hard-fought deal with Skydance, Paramount agreed to pay a $16 million settlement to the president in early July. Critics of the settlement lambasted it as a veiled bribe to appease Trump, amid rising alarm over editorial independence overall. Further outrage also emerged after CBS said it was canceling Stephen Colbert’s “Late Show” just days after the comedian sharply criticized the parent company’s settlement on air. Paramount cited financial reasons, but big names both within and outside the company have questioned those motives. When still seeking approval to buy Paramount from the Federal Communication Commission, Skydance management assured regulators that it would carefully watch for any perceived bias at CBS News and hire an ombudsman to review any complaints about fairness. In filings just last month, the company’s general counsel maintained that New Paramount will embody “a diversity of viewpoints across the political and ideological spectrum” — and also noted that it plans to take a “comprehensive review” of CBS to make “any necessary changes.” By the time the deal was approved, FCC Chairman Brendan Carr hailed the merger as an opportunity to bring more balance to “once-storied” CBS. “Americans no longer trust the legacy national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly. It is time for a change,"" Carr said. Carr also pointed to other commitments from Skydance — including company assurances about ending diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives at Paramount. In a letter addressed to Carr days before the FCC's greenlight, Skydance wrote to “confirm the elimination” of DEI initiatives previously in place at Paramount — and maintained that Skydance “does not have DEI programs in place today and will not establish such initiatives.” Skydance pointed to the Supreme Court’s 2023 decision on affirmative action in college admissions, but such moves also arrive amid the Trump administration’s wider crackdown on DEI in the workplace — and the company cited recent federal mandates impacting employers, too, noting that Paramount announced “significant changes” to its recruiting and hiring practices in February 2025. The FCC approved the merger by a 2-1 vote on July 24. The regulator who opposed it, FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez, expressed disdain for how it all came together — pointing to “months of cowardly capitulation to this administration.” “In an unprecedented move, this once-independent FCC used its vast power to pressure Paramount to broker a private legal settlement and further erode press freedom,” Gomez, who was appointed by President Joe Biden, said in a statement. She also said the agency overstepped its authority by “undermining legitimate efforts to combat discrimination and expand opportunity.” Paramount's new leaders will be watched particularly closely for how they deal with CBS News, given the $16 million settlement with Trump following his complaint about last fall's “60 Minutes” interview with his Democratic opponent, then-Vice President Kamala Harris. And the merger could also have ripple effects across other Paramount properties, including its late night and comedy programming. When first announcing the deal in July 2024, Ellison also stressed the need to transition into a “tech hybrid” to stay competitive in today’s entertainment landscape. That included plans to “rebuild” the Paramount+ streaming service, among wider efforts to expand direct-to-consumer offerings in a world with more entertainment options and shorter attention spans.

"OpenAI launches GPT-5, a potential barometer for whether AI hype is justified",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/openai-releases-gpt-5-a-potential-barometer-for-whether-artificial-intelligence-hype-is-justified-2025-08-07/,"OpenAI on Thursday released the fifth generation of the artificial intelligence technology that powers ChatGPT, a product update that's being closely watched as a measure of whether generative AI is advancing rapidly or hitting a plateau. GPT-5 arrives more than two years after the March 2023 release of GPT-4, bookending a period of intense commercial investment, hype and worry over AI's capabilities. In anticipation, rival Anthropic released the latest version of its own chatbot, Claude, earlier in the week, part of a race with Google and other competitors in the U.S. and China to leapfrog each other on AI benchmarks. Meanwhile, longtime OpenAI partner Microsoft said it will incorporate GPT-5 into its own AI assistant, Copilot. Expectations are high for the newest version of OpenAI's flagship model because the San Francisco company has long positioned its technical advancements as a path toward artificial general intelligence, or AGI, a technology that is supposed to surpass humans at economically valuable work. It is also trying to raise huge amounts of money to get there, in part to pay for the costly computer chips and data centers needed to build and run the technology. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman described the new model as a “significant step along our path to AGI” but mostly focused on its usability to the 700 million people he says use ChatGPT each week. “It’s like talking to an expert — a legitimate PhD-level expert in anything, any area you need, on demand,” Altman said at a launch event livestreamed Thursday. It may take some time to see how people use the new model — now available, with usage limits, to anyone with a free ChatGPT account. The Thursday event focused heavily on ChatGPT's use in coding, an area where Anthropic is seen as a leader, and featured a guest appearance by the CEO of coding software maker Cursor, an important Anthropic customer. OpenAI's presenters also spent time talking about safety improvements to make the chatbot “less deceptive” and stop it from producing harmful responses to “cleverly worded” prompts that could bypass its guardrails. The Associated Press reported Wednesday on a study that showed ChatGPT was providing dangerous information about drugs and self-harm to researchers posing as teenagers. At a technical level, GPT-5 shows “modest but significant improvements” on the latest benchmarks, but when compared to GPT-4, it also looks very different and resets OpenAI's flagship technology in a way that could set the stage for future innovations, said John Thickstun, an assistant professor of computer science at Cornell University. “I’m not a believer that it's the end of work and that AI is just going to solve all humanity’s problems for it, but I do think there’s still a lot of headroom for them, and other people in this space, to continue to improve the technology,” he said. “Not just capitalizing on the gains that have already been made.” OpenAI started in 2015 as a nonprofit research laboratory to safely build AGI and has since incorporated a for-profit company with a valuation that has grown to $300 billion. The company has tried to change its structure since the nonprofit board ousted Altman in November 2023. He was reinstated days later. It has not yet reported making a profit but has run into hurdles escaping its nonprofit roots, including scrutiny from the attorneys general in California and Delaware, who have oversight of nonprofits, and a lawsuit by Elon Musk, an early donor to and founder of OpenAI who now runs his own AI company. Most recently, OpenAI has said it will turn its for-profit company into a public benefit corporation, which must balance the interests of shareholders and its mission. OpenAI is the world's third most valuable private company and a bellwether for the AI industry, with an “increasingly fragile moat” at the frontier of AI, according to banking giant JPMorgan Chase, which recently made a rare decision to cover the company despite it not being publicly traded. The inability of a single AI developer to have a “sustained competitive edge” could increasingly force companies to compete on lowering the prices of their AI products, the bank said in a report last month. —— The Associated Press and OpenAI have a licensing and technology agreement that allows OpenAI access to part of AP’s text archives.

4 Semiconductor Stocks Earning Fresh Wall Street Upgrades,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/4-semiconductor-stocks-earning-fresh-wall-street-upgrades/,"Over the past weeks, important players in the semiconductor industry have reported earnings, with several names putting Wall Street estimates to shame. This caused analysts to lift their price targets significantly. These updates hint that the semiconductor rally may still have legs, especially as end-market demand improves and long-term themes like AI and automation remain intact. Below, we highlight four companies whose recent earnings and revised analyst outlooks stand out. First up is semiconductor manufacturing equipment giant Lam Research NASDAQ: LRCX, which released earnings on July 30. The company posted big beats on both sales and adjusted earnings per share (EPS). However, shares still fell more than 4% afterward as worries remain around the company’s business in China. This didn’t deter Wall Street from issuing significant upgrades. MarketBeat tracked nearly ten analysts who lifted their targets on July 31 and Aug. 1. On average, these analysts increased their price targets by more than $10. Overall, the MarketBeat consensus price target on Lam is around $107, implying around 9% upside. However, the average target among those analysts who updated their forecasts is nearly $113. This figure indicates substantially more upside, suggesting shares could rise nearly 15%. TD Cowen is notably one of the stock’s biggest bulls. Their $125 target implies 27% upside potential in this chip equipment stalwart. Next is Impinj NASDAQ: PI. This company makes small chips and related devices that help track the movement of goods. This helps customers with things like inventory management and theft prevention. Impinj blew past expectations in Q2, causing shares to gain by a whopping 26% on July 31. MarketBeat also tracked several analysts who lifted their targets on the stock on July 31, doing so by an average of 30%. However, analysts seem to believe that the market has now priced in the stock’s gain. The MarketBeat consensus price target in Impinj is around $163, indicating shares are fairly valued. Still, Impinj has a key tailwind that could allow it to deliver significant upside longer-term: the European Union’s Digital Product Passport (DPP) law. The DPP legislation requires that every product sold or made in the region is trackable throughout its lifecycle. Impinj’s technology could help companies comply, especially in its number one market: textiles. The law starts applying to textiles in 2027, which could drive big-time sales for Impinj. Monolithic Power Systems NASDAQ: MPWR shined in Q2. The company delivered better-than-expected results on the top line, bottom line, and guidance. This led shares to surge more than 10% on Aug. 1. All but one analyst tracked by MarketBeat boosted their price target on the stock in August. Overall, these analysts increased their price targets by an average of $42. The average price target among those who issued updates comes in at $850, moderately higher than the stock’s $838 consensus target. The updated $850 target implies around 2.3% upside. However, opinions range widely. Wells Fargo’s $750 target suggests around 10% downside, while KeyCorp’s $950 target implies over 14% upside potential. Still, Monolithic has delivered far above the upside that Wall Street previously forecasted. On May 7, Wall Street only saw 14% upside in shares. However, since that point, the stock has provided a total return of nearly 31%. Additionally, MPWR has seen its shares rise after nine out of its last 12 earnings releases. It’s not crazy to think the company could continue to outperform Wall Street expectations. Electronic automation design software company Cadence Design Systems NASDAQ: CDNS has also seen a notable boost in sentiment. In Q2, the company beat expectations on sales, adjusted EPS, and raised its full-year guidance. This helped shares post a nearly 10% gain on July 29, and MarketBeat tracked several analysts who raised their price targets. The MarketBeat consensus target on Cadence is just $364, almost exactly equal to the stock’s closing price on Aug. 4. However, focusing on price targets updated after earnings changes the picture. The average target among those analysts is $389, implying nearly 7% upside. Although not groundbreaking, it is certainly a big improvement over the consensus forecast. Overall, these four names are clearly moving in the right direction. Their latest results showed that Wall Street underestimated them, and analysts are now scrambling to raise their price targets. While Monolithic’s track record of topping expectations stands out, the rest of the group is also showing signs of strength. Impinj has a long-term tailwind that could prove its recent rally is just the beginning. Lam’s weakness on earnings day may have been overdone. And Cadence is back on the radar after another solid beat. If these trends continue, analysts may still be playing catch-up. Before you consider Lam Research, you'll want to hear this.

Trump's planned 100% computer chip tariff sparks confusion among businesses and trading partners,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trumps-planned-100-computer-chip-tariff-sparks-confusion-among-businesses-and-trading-partners-2025-08-07/,"President Donald Trump's ambiguous plans for 100% tariffs on computer chips that aren't made in the U.S. are stoking confusion among businesses and trading partners — boosting stocks for leading semiconductor companies while leaving smaller producers scrambling to understand the implications. “We are still waiting for official guidance,"" said Limor Fried, founder and engineer at Adafruit Industries, a small electronics maker in New York. The chips that go into Adafruit's products come through U.S. sales and distribution companies as well as direct from companies in the Philippines and Taiwan. If those chips aren't exempt from tariffs, “it would increase the costs that go into our designs as the semiconductors are the most expensive component in our assemblies,” Fried said. ""For many of these tariffs, we often have to wait until we get a bill to know our exposure, and then we adjust our pricing to account for the increases.” The U.S. imports a relatively small number of chips because most of the foreign-made chips in a device — from an iPhone to a car — were already assembled into a product, or part of a product, before it landed in the country. ""The real question everybody in the industry is asking is whether there will be a component tariff, where the chips in a device would require some sort of separate tariff calculation,” said Martin Chorzempa, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Trump said Wednesday that companies that ""made a commitment to build"" in the U.S. would be spared the import tax, even if they are not yet producing those chips in American factories. “We’ll be putting a tariff of approximately 100% on chips and semiconductors,” Trump said in the Oval Office while meeting with Apple CEO Tim Cook. “But if you’re building in the United States of America, there’s no charge.” Wall Street investors interpreted that as good news not just for U.S. companies like Intel and Nvidia, but also for the biggest Asian chipmakers like Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company that have been working to build U.S. factories. But it left greater uncertainty for smaller chipmakers in Europe and Asia that have little exposure to the artificial intelligence boom but still make semiconductors inserted into essential products like cars or washing machines. German chipmaker Infineon Technologies, which supplies chips to the auto industry, said in an emailed statement Thursday that it “can’t speculate about potential semiconductor tariffs” and Trump's announcement, “as no official documents have been published at this point.” These producers ""probably aren’t large enough to get on the map for an exemption and quite probably wouldn’t have the kind of excess capital and margins to be able to add investment at a large scale into the United States,” Chorzempa said. It's also not clear how the chip-specific tariffs would apply to trading partners that already made broader deals with Trump — such as agreements with the European Union, Japan and South Korea that tax most goods at 15%. A trade group, the Semiconductor Industry Association, said Thursday it was “eager to learn more” about the planned chip tariffs, “including the scope and structure of exemptions.” The announcement came more than three months after Trump temporarily exempted most electronics from his administration’s most onerous tariffs. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a shortage of computer chips increased the price of autos and contributed to higher inflation. Chorzempa said chip tariffs could again raise prices by hundreds of dollars per vehicle if the semiconductors inside a car are not exempt. “There’s a chip that allows you to open and close the window,"" Chorzempa said. ""There’s a chip that is running the entertainment system. There is a chip that’s kind of running all the electronics. There are chips, especially in EVs, that are doing power management, all that kind of stuff.” Much of the investment into building U.S. chip factories began with the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act that President Joe Biden signed into law in 2022, providing more than $50 billion to support new computer chip plants, fund research and train workers for the industry. Trump has vocally opposed those financial incentives and taken a different approach, betting that the threat of dramatically higher chip costs would force most companies to open factories domestically, despite the risk that tariffs could squeeze corporate profits and push up prices for electronics. Trump’s announcement could be a signal for other chipmakers to imitate the investments that companies like South Korea's Samsung are making, said Long Le, a business professor at Santa Clara University. But with China’s SMIC and Huawei unlikely to be exempted, it could also give the Trump administration ""more leverage at the trading table"" ahead of an upcoming deal with China, he said.

Average rate on a 30-year mortgage drops to lowest level since April,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/average-rate-on-a-30-year-mortgage-drops-to-lowest-level-since-april-2025-08-07/,"The average rate on a 30-year U.S. mortgage has fallen to its lowest level in four months, welcome news for prospective homebuyers who have been held back by stubbornly high home financing costs. The long-term rate fell to 6.63% from 6.72% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday. A year ago, the rate averaged 6.47%. Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, also fell. The average rate dropped to 5.75% from 5.85% last week. A year ago, it was 5.63%, Freddie Mac said. Elevated mortgage rates have helped keep the U.S. housing market in a sales slump since early 2022, when rates started to climb from the rock-bottom lows they reached during the pandemic. Home sales sank last year to their lowest level in nearly 30 years. This is the third week in a row that rates have come down. The latest average rate on a 30-year mortgage is now just above 6.62%, the low point for this year set April 10. Even so, mortgage rates are not far from their high this year of 7.04%, which was set in mid-January. That's helped keep home sales sluggish so far this year. Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, from the Federal Reserve’s interest rate policy decisions to bond market investors’ expectations for the economy and inflation. The main barometer is the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans. The yield was at 4.23% at midday Thursday, up slightly from 4.22% late Wednesday. The yield is well below where it was last week, before Friday’s weaker-than-expected report on the U.S. job market ignited worries that the Trump administration’s tariffs are stalling hiring plans by employers. Last Wednesday, the central bank’s policymaking committee voted to hold its main interest rate steady. And Fed Chair Jerome Powell pushed back on expectations that the Fed could cut rates at its next meeting in September, noting that inflation remained above the Fed’s 2% target and the job market was “in balance.” But the latest jobs report may shift that stance. Traders on Wall Street are now betting heavily that the Fed will need to cut interest rates next month, something President Donald Trump has been demanding the Fed, and Powell specifically, to do. A cut in rates could give the job market and overall economy a boost, but it could also fuel inflation just as Trump’s tariff policies risk raising prices for U.S. consumers. “While both buyers and sellers welcome lower mortgage rates, it’s not clear whether rates will continue to fall,” said Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS. “A weaker economy could lead to lower mortgage rates, but the risks of higher inflation could keep rates elevated.” Home shoppers who can afford to buy at current mortgage rates are benefiting from more homes on the market. That's led to sellers lowering asking prices compared to a year ago in many metropolitan areas, including Miami, Chicago and Los Angeles, according to Realtor.com. Lower mortgage rates tend to spur more would-be homebuyers to jump into the market, potentially driving home prices higher. Economists generally expect the average rate on a 30-year mortgage to remain above 6% this year. Recent forecasts by Realtor.com and Fannie Mae project the average rate will ease to around 6.4% by the end of this year. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

Uber Technologies Is Driving Cash Flow: Ride It Higher for Life,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/uber-technologies-is-driving-cash-flow-ride-it-higher-for-life/,"Uber Technologies NYSE: UBER started as a risky new technology and has developed into a blue-chip quality stock whose business is entrenched in society. The single factor that most summarizes that quality is its capital return, which has been robust and is getting richer by the year. The company’s business, operational quality, and growth trajectory led the board to authorize another, larger-than-before share repurchase authorization worth $20 billion or roughly 10% of the early August market cap. The takeaway is that Uber Technologies is no longer a risky tech start-up but now a buy-and-hold quality tech stock whose stock price has significant room to run. Uber’s share buybacks are not trivial. While not aggressively reducing the count, the Q2 activity resulted in a 1.1% reduction compared to the prior year and is expected to continue offsetting share-based compensation moving forward. The question is whether the company will accelerate its buying or maintain a steady pace, and when a dividend payment may be forthcoming. Comparable stocks that turn cash flow into buybacks and dividends tend to see their share prices trend higher over time. The valuation metrics suggest this stock could rise by 400% to 600% over the next 10 years. The stock trades at 32x its current year's earnings outlook, aligning with blue-chip peers, but its growth forecasts are much more robust. The forecast is for a sustained high-20% to high-30% earnings CAGR for at least the next decade, which puts the business near 5x earnings by 2035. Assuming that Uber continues to build on its technological advantages, outperforming consensus estimates for quarterly results, the long-term forecasts are too low, and the value is deeper than it appears.  Although some caution has crept into the analyst's outlook, the sentiment trends remain positive and align with an uptrending share price. The activity leading into the Q2 release includes several downgrades to Hold-equivalent ratings offset by price target increases that lead to the high-end range. The consensus of 38 analysts is a high conviction Moderate Buy rating, with more than 70% rating it as a Buy. The price target forecasts a 10% upside. The high-end range puts this market near $120, another 20% upside, and both the consensus and high-end are sufficient to set fresh all-time highs. Uber’s share price slipped following the Q2 release due to the mixed results. The company outperformed on the top line, growing revenue by nearly 19% to outpace MarketBeat’s reported consensus by 185 basis points, but missed targets on the bottom line. The bottom-line miss is due to increased investment in business acquisition and growth, so it is not a major sticking point for the market. The more critical details include the 18% increase in trips and gross bookings, the 35% increase in adjusted EBITDA, the 35% increase in adjusted earnings, and $2.5 billion in free cash flow. Regarding the free cash flow and share buybacks, the Q2 results put the payout ratio at a very sustainable near-50%. Uber’s stock price uptrend is intact despite the post-release price dip. The market retreated but did not fall below a critical support target until early August. The market may consolidate at this level and move sideways in the near term, but it is unlikely to set a new low; if it does set a new low, investors should expect to see it rebound quickly.
