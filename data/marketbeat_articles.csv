"Alabama utility commission allowed to hike prices behind closed doors, judge rules",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/alabama-utility-commission-allowed-to-hike-prices-behind-closed-doors-judge-rules-2025-07-09/,"MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — Alabama's utility regulators can continue to hold closed-door meetings to determine price hikes, in an apparent departure from common practices in neighboring states, a circuit court judge ruled. The decision on Monday rejected a lawsuit filed by Southern Environmental Law Center on behalf of Energy Alabama, a nonprofit that advocates for renewable energy sources. The watchdog group was denied access to two meetings in 2024 where the public service commission decided how Alabama Power — the state's largest electricity provider — should adjust prices based on volatility in global fuel costs. The lawsuit argued the denial flouts both local regulations and regional norms. Montgomery circuit Judge Brooke Reid ruled against the environmental advocates in a one-page order after a hearing in June. She said the group's rights had not been substantially violated. At the June hearing, Reid said the commission’s “interpretation of its own rules should be given deference.” Christina Tidwell, a senior attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center, blasted Reid’s decision in a statement on Monday. “While other Southern states have meaningful public engagement in fuel cost proceedings, Alabama Power customers will continue to be shut out of the process,” Tidwell wrote. The Alabama Public Service Commission has rules that govern how Alabama Power can change electricity prices to offset increases in fuel costs, which tend to be volatile. Those rules say that the public is entitled to hear evidence and participate in proceedings that adjust fuel costs to ensure these changes are “just and reasonable.” The lawsuit said there have been only two public fuel cost hearings since the commission’s current rules were adopted in 1981. By contrast, the Georgia Public Service Commission, which regulates a sister company of Alabama Power, has held at least 26 public formal fuel cost proceedings, according to the complaint. The last public meeting in Alabama was called because the 2008 financial crisis caused fuel prices to skyrocket rapidly, according to attorneys for the state commission. They argued that the commission hasn't technically initiated a new proceeding since that change 16 years ago, even though rates have been adjusted over 15 times since then, so they are not compelled to invite public input. Attorneys for the state also argued that the public has “plenty of opportunities for input” even without public meetings, because the commission publishes monthly reports on fuel prices online, and rate changes are subject to public appeal. Alabama Power is a subsidiary of Atlanta-based Southern Company, which reported $4.4 billion in profit in 2024, according to annual shareholder reports. Alabama Power serves about 1.5 million of the state’s roughly 5 million residents. Most Alabama residents get electricity through municipal or cooperatively owned utilities. In 2023, the average Alabama Power consumer was paying about $159 per month, compared to the statewide average of approximately $132 per month, according to the most recent data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Alabama Power did not respond to an emailed request for comment on Wednesday afternoon inquiring about recent rates. After the ruling, Energy Alabama's executive director Daniel Tait said in a statement that the decision was “disappointing” for “Alabamians who have no choice but to pay the high cost of fossil fuels on their Alabama Power bill.” ___ Riddle is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

"Alan G. Hassenfeld, former CEO of Hasbro and whose family founded the iconic toy maker, dies at 76",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/allen-g-hassenfeld-former-ceo-of-hasbro-and-whose-family-founded-the-iconic-toy-maker-dies-at-76-2025-07-09/,"NEW YORK (AP) — Alan G. Hassenfeld, a renowned philanthropist and former CEO of iconic toy company Hasbro Inc., the maker of G.I. Joe and Play-Doh, has died. He was 76, according to the toy company. Hasbro, the nation's second largest toy company behind Mattel based on annual sales, declined to offer more details. Hassenfeld's family foundation, Hassenfeld Family Initiatives, wasn't immediately available to comment. Hassenfeld was born in Providence, Rhode Island and graduated from Deerfield Academy in Massachusetts. He received an undergraduate arts degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1970. Upon graduation, he joined the Pawtucket, Rhode Island-based family business in 1970. Hasbro was founded in 1923, by Hassenfeld’s grandfather, Henry. Known initially as Hassenfeld Brothers, it sold textile remnants but expanded into school supplies and later toy manufacturing under the Hasbro name in the 1940s, according to Hasbro's website. It went public in 1968. Hassenfeld rose quickly in the family business serving as special assistant to the president and worked his way up the rank s. He became one of the key architects of Hasbro’s international operations and spent extensive time traveling overseas. He was named executive vice president in 1980 and became president in September 1984. Hassenfeld labored for years in the shadow of his older brother Stephen. His brother’s death of pneumonia in June 1989 at age 47, however, moved Hassenfeld into the position of chairman and chief executive officer. Hassenfeld stepped down as CEO in 2003 and in August 2005, he retired from his chairman position and became emeritus chairman. He stepped away from that role last year. Hassenfeld was the last family member to sit on the board, according to Hasbro. “All of us who have ever had any connection to Hasbro today are mourning the profound loss of Alan Hassenfeld, our beloved former Chairman & CEO, mentor, and dear friend, ” Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks in an e-mailed statement to The Associated Press. “Alan’s enormous heart was, and will remain, the guiding force behind Hasbro — compassionate, imaginative, and dedicated to bringing a smile to the face of every child around the world. His tireless advocacy for philanthropy, children’s welfare, and the toy industry created a legacy that will inspire us always.” Hassenfeld was involved in many charitable and social causes both nationally and locally in Rhode Island. His concerns ranged from childhood hunger to issues involving refugee settlement in the state. As chairman of the Hassenfeld Family Initiatives, he oversaw the foundation's mission of globalizing safety and human rights within the area of children’s products; empowering women in developing countries; and enhancing the economy, education and business opportunities in Rhode Island. Hassenfeld was also founding benefactor of Hasbro Children’s Hospital in Providence, and his family’s contributions helped to establish the Hassenfeld Child Health Innovation Institute at Brown University.

Tesla Stock Could Accelerate on New EV Tax Legislation,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/tesla-stock-could-accelerate-on-new-ev-tax-legislation/,"Some controversy has resurfaced in the stock market as President Trump rolled out the One Big Beautiful Bill, which will likely create a new wave of debt to be added to the United States economy. However, the main difference with this bill is that most of this newly injected capital is aimed at positive return projects rather than pursuits that won’t stimulate many areas of the economy. One of these areas is taxes; nothing stimulates production and spending like a more favorable tax positioning in any economy, which is where investors need to place their attention when it comes to understanding this new bill. Overall, there are numerous benefits in the details of the tax implications, but one targeted aspect will make some names in the automotive sector winners in the coming months and quarters. The most obvious one, of course, is Tesla Inc. NASDAQ: TSLA. Tesla has significantly increased its market share in the electric vehicle (EV) sector through cutting-edge technology and strong consumer appeal, positioning that will benefit it from the new bill's tax advantages for Tesla buyers. These themes are already influencing, and will continue to influence, the stock’s performance. Under the new legislative action, a tax break will be implemented for all vehicles assembled in the United States, regardless of where their parts are sourced, as long as the final assembly occurs domestically. With this in mind, Tesla is perfectly positioned to qualify its customers for this benefit. Considering how popular and accessible Tesla vehicles have become in the United States, any additional tax incentives—such as federal EV credits for U.S.-assembled models—could further boost demand. The potential savings on ownership costs may become more apparent to consumers, especially if Tesla highlights these benefits during the financing stage of the sales process. Following the new implementation, Tesla shares have increased by just under 1.5% so far this week, surpassing the broader S&P 500 index by 1.7%. Achieving this during a period of heightened uncertainty caused by ongoing tariff negotiations and other economic factors is no easy task. However, when it comes to potential upside, investors have seen only a fraction of what Tesla could truly accomplish in this new favorable environment, as this tax break catalyst has not yet been fully priced into the company’s valuation. Compared to other large-cap names in the technology space, Tesla offers a wide margin for investors to benefit from a “catch-up” rotation. As the stock still trades at only 62% of its 52-week high, it offers both upside and an attractive margin of safety, given the limited downside it could experience in the future. These are the sort of asymmetric returns that investors love to act on in the rare occasions that the markets offer them, which is why acclaimed Wedbush analyst Dan Ives decided to reiterate his Outperform rating on Tesla stock as of early July 2025. Not only does the rating convey an optimistic note regarding the new bill, but it also includes his price target of $500 per share, which would call for a new 52-week high, along with a net implied upside of 70% from the current stock price. What happens when the momentum for Tesla stock gets going could be confirmation that investors may already be too late. Meeting these expectations and surpassing fundamentals driven by these tax breaks, the stock's performance could trigger new buying activity from institutional investors who typically seek such breakouts and bullish momentum stocks. However, when these positions are reported, it will be too late for retail investors to take action. Currently, Tesla's 163.4x price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio places it at a significant premium over the average 23.8x valuation multiple in the automotive industry, and there’s a strong reason for this premium: a differentiated product, superior market share, and the right size to capitalize on these new tax incentives. The markets are usually willing to overpay for stocks they believe can outperform the rest of the market and peer group in the near future. It looks like Tesla has all of the right components for this to be the case moving forward, showing investors why this new fundamental change could fulfill the $500 valuation if not more.

Why Marvell Could Be the Smartest AI Bet Under $80,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/why-marvell-could-be-the-smartest-ai-bet-under-80/,"The artificial intelligence (AI) boom is reshaping the global economy, but for many investors, the most visible players come with sky-high price tags. The search is on for companies that offer strategic exposure to this explosive growth without demanding a prohibitive premium. This has drawn attention to the essential, yet often less hyped, companies that build the foundational hardware of the AI revolution. Marvell Technology NASDAQ: MRVL is a prime candidate in this search. As a leading designer of the advanced semiconductors that power data centers and AI networking, Marvell is integral to the industry's expansion. Following a significant pullback in its stock price through 2025, the company now offers what has become rare in the tech sector: a compelling growth story paired with a more down-to-earth valuation. The company's investment case begins when you look at Marvell’s price chart. Through the first half of 2025, shares have declined by approximately 35%, bringing the price below $75. This underperformance was not caused by a failure in the company’s strategy but rather by broader market headwinds. Widespread investor concerns about the global economy and speculative fears over potential new tariffs on Asian trade partners have created pressure on the entire fabless semiconductor industry, which relies on manufacturing foundries in the region. This market-driven price reset is what creates the current opportunity. It has pushed Marvell’s valuation to a level that stands out in the crowded tech sector. The company now trades at approximately 25x its projected forward earnings per share (EPS). To put that in perspective, the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 index carries an average forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) that tends to range between 34 around 40 depending on the timescale. Finding a key AI player trading at a notable discount to the sector average is uncommon. This dynamic, where a company’s long-term growth trajectory appears disconnected from its current stock price, is precisely the kind of setup that value-conscious growth investors seek. A compelling valuation is only half the story; a credible path to future growth must back it. Here, Marvell has laid out an ambitious and transparent multi-year blueprint for investors centered on dominating the most lucrative segments of the data infrastructure market. The primary engine of this plan is Marvell's strategic push into the custom silicon, or ASIC, market. As cloud giants seek to optimize performance and control the immense power costs of their AI models, they are increasingly moving away from off-the-shelf chips. Instead, they partner with firms like Marvell to co-design unique processors tailored to their specific needs. This creates a deep and very sticky relationship that is difficult for competitors to disrupt. Marvell's goal is to increase its market share from 5% in 2023 to 20% by 2028. Based on industry projections, achieving this target would generate $11 billion in annual revenue from this high-margin business alone. Beyond the development of custom chips, Marvell is targeting the entire data center ecosystem. The company plans to expand its total data center market share from 13% last year to 20% of a projected $94 billion market by 2028. This represents a clear path toward nearly $19 billion in annual data center revenue, which would be a potential fivefold increase from its fiscal 2025 results. This ambitious vision is grounded in a tangible technological advantage. Marvell is a leader in developing next-generation 2-nanometer (2nm) chips. This new platform is designed to deliver 15% higher performance while, crucially, consuming up to 35% less power than the current 3nm technology. In an industry where data center electricity usage is a primary operational cost and environmental concern, this efficiency is a powerful selling point. This tech edge is how Marvell plans to win over new clients, with a stated goal of expanding its custom AI customer base from four to ten by 2028, systematically de-risking its revenue stream along the way. For investors navigating the complexities of the AI market, Marvell Technology presents a clear and compelling case. The recent market-wide pressures have pushed its valuation to an attractive level, creating a potential discount relative to its peers. At the same time, the company has offered a transparent, multi-year roadmap for substantial growth, underpinned by a distinct technological advantage in a market that prioritizes performance and efficiency. It is this rare combination of value and vision that makes Marvell a standout opportunity for those looking to invest in the future of artificial intelligence.

Navigating Solar Headwinds: 3 Stocks Built to Last,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/navigating-solar-headwinds-3-stocks-built-to-last/,"The One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) Act is now law, and with it come several new rules and rollbacks that could weaken the clean energy industry in the U.S. While the bill's primary focus has been tax cut extensions, the legislation also eliminates many incentives for solar power, especially those in residential areas. However, while the bill remains a net negative for solar power companies, the Senate version has removed some of the more onerous provisions, and the industry may not be facing the death knell some executives feared. Today, we’ll look at which regulations did and didn’t make the OBBB Act’s final cut, and examine three stocks that can still thrive despite the new solar headwinds. Under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the investment tax credit (ITC) and production tax credit (PTC) for solar systems were extended by a decade, fueling the growth of solar energy adoption in both residential and commercial areas. However, the OBBB Act marks a swift reversal of many of these policies, including the abrupt cancellation of a crucial residential credit. Here are some of the noteworthy provisions for the solar industry: The Senate version of the OBBB Act, eventually signed into law, removed some of the stricter regulations against the solar sector, including an excise tax on imported modules, the most stringent timelines for commercial projects, and the cancellation of tax credit transferability. It still doesn’t bode well for solar as a whole, but these three companies should still be able to thrive in this environment. In stocks, there’s often safety in size, and NextEra Energy Inc. NYSE: NEE is one of the largest diversified clean energy companies in the U.S. No one produces more solar or wind capacity than NextEra (33,000 megawatts of operating energy in 2023), and its substantial output and focus on large-scale projects should help it navigate a less friendly regulatory environment. NEE shares look affordable based on historical data, and even more so when using forward projections. The stock trades at 27.5 times earnings, a tick below the 10-year average P/E of 29.1. However, the 12-month forward P/E ratio stands at 20.3, and this is expected to decrease to 18.8 by the end of 2026 and 17.2 by 2027. After a negative 2023, EPS growth rebounded 26% in 2024, with smaller but still significant projections of 7.2% for 2025 and 8% for 2026. The company missed revenue expectations in its Q1 2025 earnings report, but sales still grew 9% year-over-year (YOY), and EPS numbers matched analyst expectations. The average analyst price target of $84.55 still indicates upside potential of nearly 14% as well. First Solar Inc. NASDAQ: FSLR specializes in manufacturing solar modules and operates some of the world’s largest photovoltaic power plants. Despite the sudden solar phaseouts, First Solar’s focus on producing its modules and plants in the U.S. could give it a competitive edge in this new energy environment. First Solar’s thin-film cadmium telluride modules can be manufactured with 100% domestic components, freeing the company from tariff pressure and FEOC restrictions. Despite the bill’s harsh implications, this domestic dominance is partly why Royal Bank of Canada increased its price target from $188 to $200 this week. Of the 31 analysts covering the stock, 26 now have Buy ratings with an average price target of $228.69, implying an upside from current levels. Nextracker Inc. NASDAQ: NXT sold nearly $3 billion worth of solar trackers in the last 12 months. Trackers are devices that pair with solar panels to track the sun across the sky, much like a sunflower. They optimize solar efficiency by keeping panels perfectly aligned for maximum sunlight exposure. Solar trackers are primarily used in large utility-scale projects, which offer Nextracker some protection from the phase-outs of the solar tax credit. The stock also appears attractive compared to other solar companies, thanks to its affordable valuation and strong margins. NXT trades at just 19 times earnings, and it boosted net profit margins to 17.21% in the most recent quarter. The $679 million quarterly revenue also represented a 15% YOY increase, showing the company can grow while protecting its margins. Before you consider NextEra Energy, you'll want to hear this.

A Georgia election with few voters: Turnout is 'miserably low' in the race for utility regulator,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/a-georgia-election-with-few-voters-turnout-is-miserably-low-in-the-race-for-utility-regulator-2025-07-09/,"ATLANTA (AP) — Every time the door swings open this week at the county courthouse in the tiny south Georgia town of Statenville, six election workers have a moment to hope that someone is coming to vote. “Anybody that comes in pretty much has to walk by our office,"" said Renee Church, the elections supervisor in Echols County. But through noon on Wednesday, none of those passersby had voted in the runoff to choose either Peter Hubbard or Keisha Waites as the Democratic nominee for a seat on Georgia’s Public Service Commission. Welcome to a statewide election where almost nobody came. Through the first two of five days of early in-person voting, only 9,822 ballots were accepted. That's 0.13% of active voters, what Gabriel Sterling, the chief operating officer for Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, called “miserably low turnout.” Early in-person voting runs through Friday, with the election day set for Tuesday. Anyone can vote, except for the more than 63,000 people who voted in Republican primaries on June 17 including one in which incumbent Tim Echols beat GOP challenger Lee Muns. Waites was the top vote-getter in a June 17 Democratic primary, but didn't get a majority. That meant she had to face the second-place finisher, Hubbard, in a runoff to determine the party nominee. Barring an upswell in voter numbers, fewer than 1% of Georgia's 7.4 million active voters could cast ballots. The winner will go on to face Republican incumbent Fitz Johnson in November. Despite the low turnout, Hubbard and Waites continue to push, telling voters that breaking the Republican hold on the five-member body will mean a difference in their electric bills. The commission sets rates and oversees generation plans for Georgia Power, which serves 2.3 million customers statewide. Customers have seen bills rise six times in recent years, and a typical Georgia Power residential customer now pays more than $175 a month, including taxes. “If you don’t like the direction your power bills are going, then you have a choice. You could do something about it,” Hubbard said Wednesday. A green energy advocate, Hubbard touts his experience testifying before the commission and developing alternative plans that emphasize a shift toward solar power stored in batteries, rather than building more natural gas plants. “A vote for Peter Hubbard is a vote to put a commissioner on the Public Service Commission who brings deep experience, who can hit the ground running with novel ideas to drive down power prices while inviting economic growth to our state,” he said. Waites, a former state House member and former Atlanta City Council member, emphasizes that she would give representation to Black people and Democrats on the commission. In a statement Wednesday, Waites said her previous experience in office would help her “work with utility companies, legislators, and stakeholders to secure fair rates.” “I plan to lower energy bills by advocating for increased transparency in utility rate-setting, promoting competition within the energy sector, and prioritizing clean, renewable energy sources to reduce dependence on fossil fuels,” Waites said in the statement. It’s not like the low turnout is a surprise. Only about 140,000 people cast ballots in the June 17 Democratic primary, about 2% of voters statewide. Many Republican-leaning counties had less than 1% turnout in the Democratic primary, allowing them to activate a rarely used state law to consolidate early-voting and election day polling places to one location. A total of 76 counties triggered that clause to save money, according to the secretary of state’s office. Officials in Walton County, east of Atlanta, predict they would have spent $42,000 to operate three early voting locations and 16 election day precincts. Cutting back to only one of each, Assistant Elections Director Lisa Clark said the runoff will now cost $5,600 in a county where only 21 of nearly 79,000 active voters had cast ballots through Tuesday. “When it comes to public service commissioner, people don’t even know what a public service commissioner is or what they do,"" Clark said. ""So we were not surprised. We were hopeful it would have been bigger, but we were not surprised.” Echols isn't the only one of Georgia's 159 counties without voters in the early going. Also recording no ballots in the first two days were Chattahoochee, Clay, Glascock, Miller and Telfair counties, while seven other counties recorded one vote. But Brittany Reynolds, the election supervisor in southwest Georgia's Clay County, said Wednesday that turnout will rise there. “I do know we will have at least one vote at the end of the day because I plan on voting myself,"" Reynolds said.

What flood insurance does and does not cover,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/what-flood-insurance-does-and-does-not-cover-2025-07-09/,"SEATTLE (AP) — Though natural disasters cycle across seasons and regions in the U.S., it’s often a shocking discovery for property owners how expansive and expensive flood and water damage can be when a major storm devastates their homes, businesses and communities. That’s because oftentimes insurance doesn’t cover what the policyholder thinks it does — or thinks it should. The disappointing surprise is that while the standard home insurance policy does cover fire and wind damage, even good property insurance typically doesn’t cover things like flooding and earthquakes, which usually require a special and separate policy for each. Here are the things to know about flood insurance. Most people who have flood insurance are required to have it. Although many property owners have the option of purchasing flood insurance, it is mandated for government-backed mortgages that sit in areas that the Federal Emergency Management Agency deems highest risk. Many banks require it in high-risk zones, too. But most private insurance companies don’t carry flood insurance, leaving the National Flood Insurance Program run by FEMA as the primary provider. Congress created the federal flood insurance program more than 50 years ago when many private insurers stopped offering policies in high-risk areas. FEMA’s Flood Map Service Center has an online tool to check your area. FEMA notes even a 1% chance of flooding is considered high risk because it amounts to a 1-in-4 chance of flooding over the life of a 30-year mortgage. Homeowners in high-risk areas who should have it sometimes decide not to get it. Someone who pays off their mortgage can drop their flood insurance once it’s not required. Or if they purchase a house or mobile home with cash, they may not opt for it at all. The rest of us are just rolling the dice, even though experts have long warned that flooding can happen just about anywhere because flood damage isn’t just water surging and seeping into the land — it’s also water from banks, as well as mudflow and torrential rains. Mark Friedlander, spokesman for the Insurance Information Institute, an industry group, said only about 6% of U.S. households have a flood policy — primarily in the coastal areas prone to hurricanes. That rate has remained steady in recent years despite the increasing frequency of severe flooding events, including in areas that are not formally considered by the government to be high risk. “Lack of flood coverage is the largest insurance gap across the country,” Friedlander said in an email. “Ninety percent of U.S. natural disasters involve flooding and flooding can occur just about anywhere it rains.” Even if a homeowner does have flood insurance, the coverage may not be enough to make a policyholder whole again. FEMA’s National Flood Insurance Program only covers up to $250,000 for single-family homes and $100,000 for contents. Renters can get up to $100,000 for contents, and commercial flood insurance will cover up to $500,000. There are concerns that such flooding coverage limits are not robust enough, especially at a time when climate change is making strong hurricanes even stronger and making storms in general wetter, slower and more prone to intensifying rapidly. And what typically happens to the people without flood insurance in a major storm is that they can try to recover some money from their standard home insurance but may end up in a fight to determine what damage is or isn’t wind versus rain, or even “wind-driven rain.” Don Hornstein, an insurance law expert at the University of North Carolina, said the line between wind and water is a thin but very clear line that technical experts can determine. Should there be a proverbial tie, the law favors the insurance company. “If the house was simultaneously destroyed by flood and, concurrently (by) wind, it’s not covered by private insurance,” Hornstein said.

Senate confirms new FAA administrator at a time of rising concern about air safety,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/senate-confirms-new-faa-administrator-at-a-time-of-rising-concern-about-air-safety-2025-07-09/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Senate on Wednesday confirmed Bryan Bedford to lead the Federal Aviation Administration, putting him in charge of the federal agency at a precarious time for the airline industry after recent accidents, including the January collision near Washington, D.C. that killed 67 people. Bedford was confirmed on a near party-line vote, 53-43. Republicans and industry leaders lauded President Donald Trump's choice of Bedford, citing his experience as CEO of regional airline Republic Airways since 1999. Sen. Ted Cruz, the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, called Bedford a “steady leader with executive experience.” But Democrats and flight safety advocates opposed his nomination, citing Bedford's lack of commitment to the 1,500-hour training requirement for pilots that was put in place by Congress after a 2009 plane crash in New York. Bedford declined during his confirmation hearing to commit to upholding a rule requiring 1,500 hours of training for pilots, saying only that he would not “have anything that will reduce safety.” Sen. Maria Cantwell, the top Democrat on the Commerce panel, accused Bedford of wanting “to roll back safety reforms and unravel the regulatory framework that made the United States the gold standard” in aviation safety. Congress implemented the 1,500-hour rule for pilot training and other safety precautions after the 2009 Colgan Air crash near Buffalo, New York. In that flight, the pilot had not been trained on how to recover from a stall in the aircraft. His actions caused the plane carrying 49 people to fall from the sky and crash into a house, where another man was killed. Families of the victims of the Colgan crash pushed for the stricter training requirements and remain vocal advocates for airline safety. They joined Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer at a press conference at the U.S. Capitol to express concern about Bedford’s nomination. Marilyn Kausner, the mother of a passenger on the 3407 flight, said she and other families requested a meeting with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy after Bedford's confirmation hearing. Her husband, she said, was “discouraged” after hearing what Bedford had to say at his hearing. Pilot Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger, made famous for safely landing a plane in the Hudson River, also opposed Trump's pick, posting on social media that “with the nomination of Bryan Bedford to be FAA Administrator, my life’s work could be undone.” Republican Sen. Todd Young, who is also on the committee, called the 1,500-hour rule an “emotional topic” but maintained that Bedford’s approach to safety is clearly “analytical,” prioritizing what “we ascertain leads to the best safety for passengers.” “All you have to do is look at his credentials and his testimony to be persuaded that he’s the right person for the job,” Young said. Bedford has support from much of the industry. The air traffic controllers union noted his commitment to modernize the outdated system. Airlines for America, a trade association for major airlines, called Bedford a “superb choice.” And United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby said, having worked with Bedford, he had “total confidence in his ability to lead the FAA.” Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

Autodesk Stock Ready to Rip? Q3 May Be the Turning Point,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/autodesk-stock-ready-to-rip-q3-may-be-the-turning-point/,"Autodesk NASDAQ: ADSK can hit new highs in Q3 due to its cloud shift, AI adoption, and strong financial performance. The company persistently outperforms its consensus figures and provides favorable guidance, a recipe for positive sentiment trends that drive market action. In this case, the trends include steady analyst coverage with a relatively high number, 23, covering he stock, firming sentiment and a rising price target. The sentiment is pegged at Moderate Buy in early Q3, with revisions leading to the Strong Buy range and a significant price increase for the stock. The consensus in early July is for an 8% gain, sufficient for a new all-time high, with the most recent revisions leading to the high-end range, another 10% upside when reached. The long-term outlook for Autodesk is robust and aligns with the outlook for higher share prices. The company is forecasted to grow revenue at a slowing pace but to sustain a modest double-digit CAGR through the middle of the next decade. The top-line growth pace will be exceeded by earnings growth, and both the top- and bottom-line forecasts are likely to be light. Autodesk has outperformed its consensus more than 90% of the time and showed signs of accelerating in the latest report. Revenue grew by 15% compared to only 11% in the prior quarter and year, underpinned by client wins and penetration gains. Autodesk’s price action is at a critical resistance and potential pivot point in early Q2 2025. The market for this tech stock has moved up to retest resistance, aligning with the highs set in 2021, just below the all-time high, and may soon move above them. A move to fresh highs would signal a crucial market shift and open the door to a more sustainable rally. The market may experience turbulence at its all-time high in this scenario, but it is unlikely to correct significantly.  Autodesk had a strong Q1, setting it up for a strong year. The critical detail is that strength in all segments, product lines, and geographies reflects little to no impact from macroeconomic headwinds. The takeaway is that the consensus outlook for F2026, robust as it is, likely underestimates the company’s performance by a wide margin. As it stands, the consensus is for Q2 revenue to grow by only 14%, compared to the 15% gain in Q1; however, revisions are leading to a high-end range and may continue to boost the consensus until the results are released in late August. The balance sheet highlights at the end of Q1 didn’t reflect improvement so much as stability and strength. The cash position was up, but reduced receivables offset that. Current and total assets and liabilities were flat, leaving equity flat compared to last year. Leverage is low, with long-term net debt less than 1x equity, and cash flow allows for modest share repurchases. Repurchases reduced the count by roughly 0.5% year over year in F2025 and matched the pace in FQ1 2026, providing some leverage for shareholders. The most significant risk for investors is insider selling. Executives have been selling all year, but the headwind they present is minimal; they own only 0.15% of the stock, while institutions pose a bigger threat. Institutions, which own about 90% of the stock, bought on balance in the first half of the year but began selling in Q2. The mitigating factor is that the initial reports for Q3 show significant buying activity in the quarter’s first week, suggesting a tailwind for price action that can help lift the stock price in the back half of 2025.

Customers seeking deals gave Amazon's Prime Day and competing sales a solid start,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/customers-seeking-deals-gave-amazons-prime-day-and-competing-sales-a-solid-start-2025-07-09/,"NEW YORK (AP) — The first day of Amazon's Prime Day event and competing retail sales that kicked off on Tuesday drove solid online spending compared to a year earlier, according to two data sources. Adobe Digital Insights, which tracks visits to e-commerce sites, reported that U.S. consumers spent $7.9 billion at online stores on Tuesday, a 9.9% increase from the comparable day last year. Retailers offered discounts in the range of 9% to 23%, on par with July 2024 sales events, Adobe said. Shoppers appeared especially eager to take advantage of deals on appliances, electronics and home improvement products, the data company said. Online sales of appliances were 135% higher than last month's daily average, according to Adobe's data. Back-to-school items also were popular. Spending increased threefold on school supplies like backpacks, lunchboxes and stationery, and was two times higher for college dorm fixtures like mattresses, mini refrigerators and microwave over, Adobe said. Amazon doubled the length of Prime Day to four days this year. Walmart also added two more days to its summer deals event, which started Tuesday as well. Retail analysts are evaluating this week's sales for clues on whether President Donald Trump's trade policy and unpredictable tariffs affect prices and consumer behavior. Adobe noted that strong deals drove many shoppers to “trade up” to higher-ticket items. Across all categories the company tracks, the share of the most expensive goods increased by 20%, compared to average levels year to date. According to consumer data company Numerator, the average Prime Day order on Tuesday cost $58.37. However, the average household cost amounted to more than $106 as of 4 p.m. Eastern time because 42% of households participating in Prime Day placed more than two orders, the company said. Numerator tracks U.S. retail prices through sales receipts, online account activity and other information from a panel of 200,000 shoppers. Physical stores in the U.S. may see spillover traffic from online sales events this week as budget-minded customers comparison shop in search of the lowest prices, according to R.J. Hottovy, head of analytical research at Placer.ai. The location data company tracks people’s movements based on cellphone usage. “We do still have a price-sensitive consumer that is actively monitoring price hikes and anything related to tariffs,” Hottovy said. Despite ongoing economic concerns, Adobe said it expected online sales to spur a record $23.8 billion in spending from July 8 to July 11, which would represent 28.4% growth year over year. Adobe’s numbers are not adjusted for inflation. However, the company said new demand, not rising prices, largely accounts for growing sales figures so far this year. Seattle-based Amazon does not disclose how much it earns during Prime Day but said it would share some results from the four-day event on Saturday Before you consider Amazon.com, you'll want to hear this.

Do They Know Something? Insiders & Congress Buy UnitedHealth,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/do-they-know-something-insiders-and-congress-buy-unitedhealth/,"UnitedHealth Group NYSE: UNH has spent a significant amount of time in the sick bay for the first half of 2025, but it’s showing signs of recovery. Let’s get the bad news out of the way first. The Eden Prairie, Minn.-based company has fallen 40% year-to-date and has plummeted 42.2% in the past three months alone, with most of that decline occurring in April and May. Over the past month, UNH shares have remained relatively flat, with a 0.1% gain. Despite a turbulent start to the year, the healthcare services giant’s recent leadership changes and insider investments signal a potential path to recovery. And investors would be wise to pay attention: when executives are buying big, it often signals the bottom is in. So what’s ailing UNH? Primarily, UnitedHealth's stock has suffered over multiple downbeat issues, including a headline-grabbing cybersecurity attack, soft earnings, federal regulatory headaches, and the resignation of CEO Andrew Witty, who helmed the firm since 2021 (and who served as CEO at GlaxoSmithKline from 2008 to 2017). It’s the last issue that resonates right now, especially given the UNH share bounce back of late. Witty was replaced by former UNH CEO Stephen J. Hemsley on May 13, who immediately offered an interesting outlook on the healthcare company’s financial fortunes. “UnitedHealth Group has tremendous opportunities to grow as we continue to help improve health care and to perform to our potential, and, in so doing, return to our long-term growth objective of 13 to 16 percent,” Helmsley stated. Almost simultaneously, company insiders and Congressional leading lights began snapping up shares of UNH stock. Georgia Congressional Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene bought between $15,000 and $50,000 shares of UNH on May 14 and purchased between $1,001 and $15,000 on May 16. And she’s not alone. Texas Republican Congressman Michael McCaul purchased up to $50,000 in UNH shares on May 16, while Democratic Representatives Mo Khanna and Gilbert Cisneros also bought UnitedHealth shares, but did so in early 2025. UNH executives are stacking company shares. On May 16, Hemsley bought $25 million worth of UNH stock, locking in 86,700 shares at an average price of $288.57 each. Additionally, company CFO John Rex and Director Kristen Gill were substantial UNH share buyers on May 16, 2025. So what do Congressional portfolio builders and UnitedHealth’s C-suite know that the investing public doesn’t know? The answer is ‘nothing out of the ordinary,’ especially from UNH executives. UnitedHealth’s leadership has stated that the company is on track for robust growth by 2026, while Hemsley is expected to reinstate UNH’s forward financial guidance, which was previously abandoned by the previous regime due to a series of adverse news reports and sluggish earnings. In an early June meeting with shareholders, Hemsley said his team was committed to winning back their trust and confidence. He also promised to review underperforming company areas, such as pharmacy services and risk management. “With our second quarter report on July 29, we will establish a prudent 2025 earnings outlook and offer initial perspectives for 2026,” Hemsley told shareholders. “Across the enterprise, our pricing decisions and benefit designs for the next year are being fully shaped—with an abundance of respect—for the trend factors we noted in May and the environment we find ourselves in today and see going forward.” Another immediate focus area will be on pricing disciplines. Hemsley acknowledged past missteps in forecasting care activity and costs, noting that these errors led to unsustainable growth. The company is now overhauling its forecasting methods to improve accuracy and financial oversight. Moreover, Hemsley said UNH needs to move past problems with financial guidance, data security issues, and a U.S. Justice Department probe into alleged fraud, and focus on an operational and financial turnaround. Analysts believe Hemsley can do the job, giving UNH stock a consensus Moderate Buy rating. Of the 25 analysts tracked by MarketBeat, 16 have issued a Buy rating for UNH, with only one giving it a Sell. The average price target is $415.57, signaling a potential upside of 35.61% from where it is currently trading. UBS analyst AJ Rice is among the recent backers of UnitedHealth, even as he cut his one-year price target of UNH shares from $400 to $385 with a Buy call on the stock. He thinks the new management team's measured approach, especially on its upcoming guidance call, will pacify shareholders and promote stability to interested investors. “We believe the company wants to offer a new 2025 outlook that it can be assured of delivering and, therefore, we expect the number to be even more conservative than normal when all is said and done,” Rice stated in a recent research note.

The Czech Republic bans DeepSeek in state administration over cybersecurity concerns,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/the-czech-republic-bans-deepseek-in-state-administration-over-cybersecurity-concerns-2025-07-09/,"PRAGUE (AP) — The Czech Republic has banned the use of any products by the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek in state administration over cybersecurity concerns, authorities said Wednesday. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said the government acted after receiving a warning from the national cybersecurity watchdog, which noted a threat of unauthorized access to users data because the firm is obliged to cooperate with Chinese state authorities. The move follows similar steps made by some other countries that aimed to protect users’ data, including Italy, which in January blocked access to the chatbot, and also Australia. The Czech government in 2018 stopped using the hardware and software made by Chinese telecoms company Huawei and another Chinese telecommunications company, ZTE, after a warning they posed a security threat.

"Trump tariffs goods from Brazil at 50%, citing 'witch hunt' trial against country's former president",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-sends-out-tariff-letters-to-6-more-countries-but-he-avoids-major-us-trade-partners-2025-07-09/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump singled out Brazil for import taxes of 50% on Wednesday for its treatment of its former president, Jair Bolsonaro, showing that personal grudges rather than simple economics are a driving force in the U.S. leader's use of tariffs. Trump avoided his standard form letter with Brazil, specifically tying his tariffs to the trial of Bolsonaro, who is charged with trying to overturn his 2022 election loss. Trump has described Bolsonaro as a friend and hosted the former Brazilian president at his Mar-a-Lago resort when both were in power in 2020. “This Trial should not be taking place,” Trump wrote in the letter posted on Truth Social. “It is a Witch Hunt that should end IMMEDIATELY!” There is a sense of kinship as Trump was indicted in 2023 for his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 U.S. presidential election. The U.S. president addressed his tariff letter to Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who bested Bolsonaro in 2022. Lula responded in a forceful statement that said Trump's tariffs would trigger the country's economic reciprocity law, which allows trade, investment and intellectual property agreements to be suspended against countries that harm Brazil's competitiveness. He noted that the U.S. has had a trade surplus of more than $410 billion with Brazil over the past 15 years. “Brazil is a sovereign country with independent institutions that will not accept being taken for granted by anyone,” Lula said. Bolsonaro testified before the country’s Supreme Court in June over the alleged plot to remain in power after his 2022 election loss. Judges will hear from 26 other defendants in the coming months, and legal analysts say a decision could come as early as September. The country’s electoral authorities have already barred Bolsonaro from running for office until 2030. The former president did not comment about Trump’s tariff decision on his social media channels, but wrote that he is being politically persecuted. In his statement, Lula defended the country's legal system, saying the “proceedings against those who planned the coup d’etat is a competence of the Brazilian judiciary and is not subject to interference or threats that harm the independence of national institutions.” Trump also objected to Brazil's Supreme Court fining of social media companies, saying the temporary blocking last year amounted to “SECRET and UNLAWFUL Censorship Orders.” Trump said he is launching an investigation as a result under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which applies to countries with trade practices that are deemed unfair to U.S. companies. Among the companies the Supreme Court fined was X, which was not mentioned specifically in Trump's letter. X is owned by Elon Musk, Trump's multibillionaire backer in the 2024 election whose time leading Trump's Department of Government Efficiency recently ended and led to a public feud over the U.S. president's deficit-increasing budget plan. Trump also owns a social media company, Truth Social. “In Brazil, freedom of speech is not mistaken by aggression or violent behavior,"" Lula said in his statement. ""To operate in our country, every company, local or foreign, must be subjected to Brazilian legislation.” Brazilian lawmakers allied with Lula blamed Bolsonaro and two of his sons, congressman Eduardo Bolsonaro and Sen. Flávio Bolsonaro, for Trump’s tariff action. Sen. Lindbergh Farias, the whip of Lula’s Workers’ Party in the Senate, said on social media that the Bolsonaros “must be very happy to harm Brazil, our economy and our jobs.” The Brazil letter was a reminder that politics and personal relations with Trump matter just as much as any economic fundamentals. And while Trump has said the high tariff rates he’s setting are based on trade imbalances, it was unclear by his Wednesday actions how the countries being targeted would help to reindustrialize America. The tariffs starting Aug. 1 would be a dramatic increase from the 10% rate that Trump levied on Brazil as part of his April 2 “Liberation Day” announcement. In addition to oil, Brazil sells orange juice, coffee, iron and steel to the U.S., among other products. The U.S. ran a $6.8 billion trade surplus with Brazil last year, according to the Census Bureau. Trump initially announced his broad tariffs by declaring an economic emergency, arguing under a 1977 law that the U.S. was at risk because of persistent trade imbalances. But that rationale becomes problematic in this particular case, as Trump is linking his tariffs to the Bolsonaro trial and the U.S. exports more to Brazil than it imports. Trump also sent letters Wednesday to the leaders of seven other nations. None of them — the Philippines, Brunei, Moldova, Algeria, Libya, Iraq and Sri Lanka — is a major industrial rival to the United States. Most economic analyses say the tariffs will worsen inflationary pressures and subtract from economic growth, but Trump has used the taxes as a way to assert the diplomatic and financial power of the U.S. on both rivals and allies. His administration is promising that the taxes on imports will lower trade imbalances, offset some of the cost of the tax cuts he signed into law on Friday and cause factory jobs to return to the United States. Trump, during a White House meeting with African leaders, talked up trade as a diplomatic tool. Trade, he said, “seems to be a foundation” for him to settle disputes between India and Pakistan, as well as Kosovo and Serbia. “You guys are going to fight, we’re not going to trade,” Trump said. “And we seem to be quite successful in doing that.” Trump said the tariff rates in his letters were based on “common sense” and trade imbalances, even though the Brazil letter indicated otherwise. Trump suggested he had not thought of penalizing the countries whose leaders were meeting with him in the Oval Office — Liberia, Senegal, Gabon, Mauritania and Guinea-Bissau — as “these are friends of mine now.” Countries are not complaining about the rates outlined in his letters, he said, even though those tariffs have been generally close to the ones announced April 2 that rattled financial markets. The S&P 500 stock index rose Wednesday. “We really haven’t had too many complaints because I’m keeping them at a very low number, very conservative as you would say,” Trump said. Officials for the European Union, a major trade partner and source of Trump's ire on trade, said Tuesday that they are not expecting to receive a letter from Trump listing tariff rates. The Republican president started the process of announcing tariff rates on Monday by hitting two major U.S. trading partners, Japan and South Korea, with import taxes of 25%. According to Trump's Wednesday letters, imports from Libya, Iraq, Algeria and Sri Lanka would be taxed at 30%, those from Moldova and Brunei at 25% and those from the Philippines at 20%. The tariffs would start Aug. 1. The Census Bureau reported that last year the U.S. ran a trade imbalance on goods of $1.4 billion with Algeria, $5.9 billion with Iraq, $900 million with Libya, $4.9 billion with the Philippines, $2.6 billion with Sri Lanka, $111 million with Brunei and $85 million with Moldova. The imbalance represents the difference between what the U.S. exported to those countries and what it imported. Taken together, the trade imbalances with those seven countries are essentially a rounding error in a U.S. economy with a gross domestic product of $30 trillion. The letters were posted on Truth Social after the expiration of a 90-day negotiating period with a baseline levy of 10%. Trump is giving countries more time to negotiate with his Aug. 1 deadline, but he has insisted there will be no extensions for the countries that receive letters. The president threatened additional tariffs on any country that attempts to retaliate. ___ Savarese reported from Rio de Janeiro.

Mattel introduces its first Barbie with Type 1 diabetes,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/mattel-introduces-its-first-barbie-with-type-1-diabetes-2025-07-09/,"NEW YORK (AP) — Mattel has introduced its first Barbie representing a person with Type 1 diabetes, as part of wider efforts from the toy maker to increase inclusivity among its dolls. In an announcement Tuesday, Mattel said it had partnered with Breakthrough T1D — a Type 1 diabetes research and advocacy organization formerly known as Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, or JDRF — to ensure that the design of the doll “truly captures the community."" That includes accessories that “accurately reflect the medical equipment"" people with Type 1 diabetes may need, the California-based company noted. “Visibility matters for everyone facing Type 1 diabetes,” Emily Mazreku, director of marketing strategy at Breakthrough T1D, said in an accompanying announcement. And as a mother who lives with Type 1 diabetes, she added, “it means everything to have Barbie helping the world see T1D and the incredible people who live with it.” The new Barbie wears continuous glucose monitor (CGM), a device that tracks blood sugar levels, on her arm — while holding a phone displaying an accompanying app. She also has an insulin pump attached to her waist. And the doll carries a blue purse that can be used to carry other essential supplies or snacks on the go. The Barbie's outfit is blue, too — with polka dots on a matching top and skirt set. Mattel says that this color and design are nods to symbols for diabetes awareness. This new doll “enables more children to see themselves reflected in Barbie,” Mattel wrote Tuesday, and is part of the company's wider Fashionistas line committed to inclusivity. The line features Barbies with various skin tones, hair colors and textures, disabilities, body types and more. Previously-introduced Fashionistas include a Ken doll with a prosthetic leg and a Barbie with hearing aids. Mattel also introduced its first doll with Down syndrome in 2023. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 38.4 million Americans of all ages — amounting to about 11.6% of the U.S. population — were estimated to have diabetes as of 2021, the latest year with data available. About 2 million had Type 1 diabetes, including about 304,000 children and teens younger than 20. Barbie's new doll with Type 1 diabetes was also introduced at Breakthrough T1D's 2025 Children’s Congress held in Washington, D.C. this week, where the organization is advocating for continued federal research funding.

"Nvidia is again Wall Street's most valuable company. How it got there, by the numbers",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/nvidia-is-again-wall-streets-most-valuable-company-how-it-got-there-by-the-numbers-2025-07-09/,"Nvidia reached another milestone in its rise to becoming one of the world's most important companies: the first publicly traded company to reach a market value of $4 trillion. Nvidia and other companies benefiting from the boom in artificial intelligence have been a major reason the S&P 500 has recently climbed to a record. Their explosion of profits has helped to propel the market despite worries about possible pain coming for the U.S. economy from tariffs and other policies of President Donald Trump. The company’s journey to be one of the world's most prominent companies has produced some eye-popping numbers. Here’s a look. Nvidia’s total market value as of early Wednesday, tops in the S&P 500. It closed with a market value of $3.972 trillion. Nvidia took over the No. 1 spot from Microsoft ($3.742 trillion) two weeks ago. Apple is the only other company with a market value above $3 trillion ($3.154 trillion). Nvidia’s market value in July 2023 was around $1.050 trillion. The approximate gain in Nvidia’s stock price since the start of 2023. A $100,000 investment in Nvidia two and a half years ago would now be worth more than $1,100,000. The shares are up about 21% so far this year. Nvidia’s estimate for overall revenue in the May-July quarter, roughly in line with Wall Street estimates. The estimated loss in sales for the quarter due to the U.S. government’s restrictions on Nvidia's chip sales to China. Analysts’ estimate for Nvidia’s revenue for the fiscal year that ends in January 2026, according to FactSet. That would be more than 50% above its revenue for fiscal 2025 and more than three times its receipts from the year before that. By comparison, Microsoft's revenue for its fiscal year ended in June is estimated by analysts at $279 billion. The number of the latest iPhones one could buy with $4 trillion.

"Robinhood Stock Gets 5 Price Target Upgrades, Signaling Upside",https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/robinhood-stock-gets-5-price-target-upgrades-signaling-upside/,"Robinhood Markets NASDAQ: HOOD missed out on inclusion in the S&P 500, but the last thing the company is doing is focusing on the past. The firm just announced innovations that have Wall Street analysts swooning. Robinhood has been one of the hottest stocks in the market recently. As of the July 7 close, shares of the finance company were up 312% over the past 52 weeks. The company’s expanded product offerings and crypto trading demand have been key to its success. However, the company is far from done adding new features and growing its presence in different markets. That’s a big reason why Robinhood received five Wall Street price target upgrades in July. These aren’t just any upgrades, either. Several analysts increased their price targets massively, with one boosting its target by 100%. So, what is causing these analysts to become so much more bullish on Robinhood? Just how much upside do they see? Let’s dive in below. The increases in Robinhood’s price targets come after the company’s “To Catch a Token” event on June 30. During the event, the company unveiled new features, the most notable of which was the introduction of tokenized U.S. stocks and ETFs for Robinhood’s users in the European Union. This is big for expanding the company’s international footprint. Before this release, EU users could only trade crypto on Robinhood. The tokenization route allows Robinhood to bypass the regulatory requirements for users to buy U.S. stocks. The release greatly accelerates Robinhood’s timeline for gaining traction in the EU equity trading market and creates a new revenue stream. It starts with 200 of the most well-known U.S. stocks and ETFs, but the company plans to expand this into thousands by the end of the year. The company’s new blockchain, Robinhood Chain, makes this possible. Robinhood Chain will expand to allow investors to trade many other types of assets. This includes real estate, art, and even the stock of private companies. Robinhood announced that EU customers could access private stock tokens of OpenAI and SpaceX. Expansion into these assets is another way Robinhood can grow its customer base, attracting more assets and revenues. Notably, these tokenized offerings are not available to U.S. users. The company also announced that crypto trading is now available in 31 European countries, greatly expanding access and further broadening its market opportunities. The MarketBeat consensus price target on Robinhood is just under $73. This implies a downside of over 22% from the stock’s July 7 closing price. However, the five price targets updated by the To Catch a Token event flip the script. Their average comes in at nearly $103, which signals that shares could rise by 10%, greatly altering the outlook on the stock. Overall, the average price target among these five analysts' upgrades increased by 28%, signaling the event greatly impacted their perceptions of Robinhood. Notably, Citigroup boosted its target from $50 to $100. One risk for Robinhood is the potential that the company is moving too fast. The firm has rolled out update after update, strengthening its ability to keep and attract assets. This is an exciting strategy, but it could backfire if the company does not execute its rollouts to a tee. One of the key reasons the Robinhood platform attracts customers is the top-notch user experience it offers. Maintaining this is paramount to keeping and growing its customer base. The company seems to have also stepped into a legal gray area with its private stock tokens. Investors do not actually own shares in these companies, and OpenAI has said the company does not endorse the Robinhood product. The Bank of Lithuania is seeking clarification from Robinhood to assess the legality of the instruments. Robinhood will need to avoid legal trouble as it expands its offerings to avoid damaging the trust it has built with users. Still, Robinhood continues to demonstrate a level of innovation and product expansion within the investment industry that no other firm is matching. This positions the firm to outcompete others going forward and grow faster than its industry if it can avoid the potential pitfalls of its aggressive strategy. This can allow the stock to continue winning. Before you consider Robinhood Markets, you'll want to hear this.

Samsung unveils its new line of foldable devices at Unpacked,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/samsung-unveils-its-new-line-of-foldable-devices-at-unpacked-2025-07-09/,"NEW YORK (AP) — Samsung introduced several updates to its foldable devices lineup on Wednesday, with the new Galaxy Z Fold 7, Z Flip 7, and the new Z Flip 7 FE taking stage at the latest Unpacked event. The Korean electronics company unveiled the upgrades — including new versions of their watch — in New York but also announced an expanded partnership with Google to inject more artificial intelligence into its foldable lineup. Here are the biggest announcements from this summer's Unpacked event: The Galaxy Z Fold 7 is much thinner and lighter than its predecessors, coming in at 0.17 inch thick when unfolded and less than half an inch folded. It also weighs slightly less than half a pound, an impressive feat considering the company also increased the total size of the screens from the Fold 6 — now 6.5 inches for the exterior screen and 8 inches for the interior screen. The battery capacity remains the same as the previous generation. But unlike previous generations of fold devices, this one doesn't support the company's digital stylus. A 200 megapixel camera will act as the main capture and a 10 megapixel camera that extends along the frame of the phone gives users the ability to quickly capture wide shots. The Fold 7 will retail starting at $1,999. Pre-orders start today, and the device will hit shelves on July 25. The flippable cousin of the Fold has an enlarged 4.1-inch top screen and the clamshell folds down to just over half an inch. The inner display grows to 6.9 inches from the Flip 6's 6.7 inches. It gets a slightly bigger 4,300mAh battery and maintains a 50 megapixel main camera and 10 megapixel front camera. A new, cheaper version of the phone, called the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE was also announced today. It's a slightly smaller version — keeping the Fold 6's 6.7 inch screen size — of its premium counterpart. The Galaxy Z Flip 7 will retail for $1,099.99 and the Flip 7 FE starts at $899.99. Pre-orders for both devices began Wednesday and both will be available generally on July 25. The Galaxy Watch Ultra, Watch 8 and Watch 8 Classic have all been refreshed with various updates — memory, thickness, design — but the main takeaway from today's event is that Google's Gemini AI was being preloaded onto the devices. Users can access the AI by speaking to their watch. Rick Osterloh, Google’s senior vice president of devices and services, appeared in a pre-recorded video at Unpacked to announce that the AI Mode of its search engine will be used in Samsung's circle to search function, allowing users to make quick queries by tapping or circling things on their screen. And Gemini will receive further integration with base Samsung device apps, like Calendar and Reminders. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

X CEO Linda Yaccarino resigns after two years at the helm of Elon Musk's social media platform,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/x-ceo-linda-yaccarino-resigns-after-two-years-at-the-helm-of-elon-musks-social-media-platform-2025-07-09/,"X CEO Linda Yaccarino said she’s stepping down after two bumpy years running Elon Musk’s social media platform. Yaccarino posted a positive message Wednesday about her tenure at the company formerly known as Twitter and said “the best is yet to come as X enters a new chapter with” Musk’s artificial intelligence company xAI, maker of the chatbot Grok. She did not say why she is leaving. Musk responded to Yaccarino's announcement with his own 5-word statement on X: “Thank you for your contributions.” “The only thing that’s surprising about Linda Yaccarino’s resignation is that it didn’t come sooner,” said Forrester research director Mike Proulx. “It was clear from the start that she was being set up to fail by a limited scope as the company’s chief executive.” In reality, Proulx added, Musk “is and always has been at the helm of X. And that made Linda X’s CEO in title only, which is a very tough position to be in, especially for someone of Linda’s talents.” Musk hired Yaccarino, a veteran ad executive, in May 2023 after buying Twitter for $44 billion in late 2022 and cutting most of its staff. He said at the time that Yaccarino’s role would be focused mainly on running the company’s business operations, leaving him to focus on product design and new technology. Before announcing her hiring, Musk said whoever took over as the company’s CEO “ must like pain a lot.” In accepting the job, Yaccarino was taking on the challenge of getting big brands back to advertising on the social media platform after months of upheaval following Musk's takeover. She also had to work in a supporting role to Musk's outsized persona on and off of X as he loosened content moderation rules in the name of free speech and restored accounts previously banned by the social media platform. “Being the CEO of X was always going to be a tough job, and Yaccarino lasted in the role longer than many expected. Faced with a mercurial owner who never fully stepped away from the helm and continued to use the platform as his personal megaphone, Yaccarino had to try to run the business while also regularly putting out fires,"" said Emarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg. Yaccarino's future at X became unclear earlier this year after Musk merged the social media platform with his artificial intelligence company, xAI. And the advertising issues have not subsided. Since Musk's takeover, a number of companies had pulled back on ad spending — the platform’s chief source of revenue — over concerns that Musk’s thinning of content restrictions was enabling hateful and toxic speech to flourish. Most recently, an update to Grok led to a flood of antisemitic commentary from the chatbot this week that included praise of Adolf Hitler. “We are aware of recent posts made by Grok and are actively working to remove the inappropriate posts,” the Grok account posted on X early Wednesday, without being more specific. Some experts have tied Grok's behavior to Musk's deliberate efforts to mold Grok as an alternative to chatbots he considers too “woke,” such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini. In late June, he invited X users to help train the chatbot on their commentary in a way that invited a flood of racist responses and conspiracy theories. “Please reply to this post with divisive facts for @Grok training,” Musk said in the June 21 post. “By this I mean things that are politically incorrect, but nonetheless factually true.” A similar instruction was later baked into Grok's “prompts” that instruct it on how to respond, which told the chatbot to “not shy away from making claims which are politically incorrect, as long as they are well substantiated.” That part of the instructions was later deleted. “To me, this has all the fingerprints of Elon’s involvement,” said Talia Ringer, a professor of computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Yaccarino has not publicly commented on the latest hate speech controversy. She has, at times, ardently defended Musk's approach, including in a lawsuit against liberal advocacy group Media Matters for America over a report that claimed leading advertisers’ posts on X were appearing alongside neo-Nazi and white nationalist content. The report led some advertisers to pause their activity on X. A federal judge last year dismissed X's lawsuit against another nonprofit, the Center for Countering Digital Hate, which has documented the increase in hate speech on the site since it was acquired by Musk. X is also in an ongoing legal dispute with major advertisers — including CVS, Mars, Lego, Nestle, Shell and Tyson Foods — over what it has alleged was a “massive advertiser boycott” that deprived the company of billions of dollars in revenue and violated antitrust laws. Enberg said that, ""to a degree, Yaccarino accomplished what she was hired to do."" Emarketer expects X’s ad business to return to growth in 2025 after more than halving between 2022 and 2023 following Musk’s takeover. But, she added, ""the reasons for X’s ad recovery are complicated, and Yaccarino was unable to restore the platform’s reputation among advertisers.” Analysts have said that some advertisers may have returned to X to avoid alienating Trump supporters during the height of Musk's affiliation with the president and his base. Legal threats may have also played a part — whether from X or from the Federal Trade Commission, which is investigating Media Matters over its reporting that hateful content has increased on X since Musk took over, resulting in an advertiser exodus. Media Matters has in turn sued the FTC, claiming it seeks to punish protected speech. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

Zscaler or CrowdStrike: Which Is the Better Buy in 2025?,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/zscaler-or-crowdstrike-which-is-the-better-buy-in-2025/,"Zscaler NASDAQ: ZS and CrowdStrike NASDAQ: CRWD are both buyable stocks supported by robust trends promising to drive a solid double-digit revenue CAGR for years. They both grow at an above-industry pace and are well-positioned in an industry projected to grow slower than the pace of threats it intends to prevent. Cybersecurity growth is forecasted to have a 9% CAGR, compared to the 15% CAGR driven by cyber threats. The problem is that one of these markets is already pricing much of the growth. The takeaway is that both are well-supported and have a long runway for success, but one is a better buy in 2025 due to market dynamics. Where one stock is moving up from its low, on track to retest its long-term highs, and driven by analyst trends, the other is already well above the comparable highs and extended, with analysts trimming their sentiment. The better buy is Zscaler, with potential for a double-digit increase this year and next, while the poorer is CrowdStrike, set up to pull back and offer a more attractive entry later this year. To be fair, CrowdStrike’s headwind is minimal, but it is a factor that investors and traders should take note of. As of early July, the analysts' trends are bullish but reflect a more cautious tone than last year. There are an increasing number of Sell and Hold ratings, a declining number of Buys, and a 10% downside at the consensus. The June activity includes two downgrades from Outperform/Overweight levels to Hold/Neutral equivalents, and more are expected. CrowdStrike is a solid growth company, but it is highly valued at over 55x the 2030 EPS outlook.  Zscaler’s analyst trends are far more robust and capable of driving its share price even higher. The June and early July activity includes numerous price target increases, upgrades, and no reductions. The net result is increased coverage, a firmer Moderate Buy rating, and 5% increase in the consensus price target. The consensus lags behind the price action in early July, but by a narrower 5% margin, and is rising, providing support for the market. The range of June/July targets positions Zscaler stock well above the broad consensus and near the high end of $385, a new all-time high when reached. CrowdStrike’s chart action isn’t overtly bearish but offers risk to new investors. The market is trading at an all-time high with diminishing analyst support and indications that it is overbought. The caveat is that institutional support remains solid, with them buying on balance in Q1 and Q2. The likely outcome is that a price pullback will catalyze a buying opportunity, and the price action will not correct significantly. The risk for investors is that CRWD shares will enter a protracted consolidation and trading range that could last until earnings catch up with the valuation or the outlook is improved. Zscaler's price action, on the other hand, is overtly bullish. The market for this stock rallied strongly in Q2 and is waving a bull flag in early Q3. The Bull Flag is a continuation pattern signaling that the rally is, at best, half over. In this scenario, the market for Zscaler stock can advance by another $150 and easily surpass the analyst's highest target. The catalyst for Zscaler’s new highs will likely be its Q4 earnings report. The company issued favorable guidance at the end of Q3 and showed signs of growing momentum, suggesting that outperformance is possible. Those include the calculated billings and deferred revenue, which grew faster than reported revenue, the increased client count, and strength in AI-focused security.

Franck Sorbier fuses Andean splendor with Parisian pageantry on couture runway,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/franck-sorbier-fuses-andean-splendor-with-parisian-pageantry-on-couture-runway-2025-07-09/,"PARIS (AP) — Franck Sorbier, the Paris couturier officially inducted into the haute couture fold in 2005, delivered a regal, Inca-inspired spectacle on Wednesday that fused theater and artistry with the cosmopolitan codes of couture. The show’s standout image was a model crowned in gold, wielding a giant sun-topped staff—a visual exclamation point for a collection steeped in pageantry and myth. Sorbier’s silhouettes had a historic weight, with loose, voluminous skirts swirling beneath strict, structured bodices, conjuring a sense of ceremony. Gilded chainmail and coin-like embellishments suggested a protective armor, but rendered in delicate, sleeveless forms. A poncho, fringed in sumptuous gold, mixed Andean spirit with Parisian panache—while elsewhere, lush, unfurling coats were embroidered with organic, figurative motifs that seemed to grow across the fabric. Detail shone throughout: dense ruffles poking from the bottom of old-world shirts, rich shawls cascading with embellishment, and surfaces that rewarded a second, closer look. Sorbier’s backdrop was equally arresting — a landscape of bubbling, volcanic fabric, amorphous and vividly alive, underscoring his ability to transform couture into a living tableau. Known for merging cultural narratives with technical virtuosity, Sorbier proved once more that Paris couture can look backward and outward, drawing inspiration from global myth while staying rigorously hand-crafted. Through this cross-cultural lens, Sorbier’s latest collection stood as a bold reminder that couture, at its best, is both spectacle and narrative.

Trump appointees have ties to companies that stand to benefit from privatizing weather forecasts,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-appointees-have-ties-to-companies-that-stand-to-benefit-from-privatizing-weather-forecasts-2025-07-09/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — As commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick oversees the U.S. government’s vast efforts to monitor and predict the weather. The billionaire also ran a financial firm, which he recently left in the control of his adult sons, that stands to benefit if President Donald Trump’s administration follows through on a decade-long Republican effort to privatize government weather forecasting. Deadly flooding in Texas has drawn a spotlight to budget cuts and staff reductions at the National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, agencies housed within the Commerce Department that provide the public with free climate and weather data that can be crucial during natural disasters. What’s drawn less attention is how the downsizing appears to be part of an effort to privatize the work of such agencies. In several instances, the companies poised to step into the void have deep ties to people tapped by Trump to run weather-related agencies. Privatization would diminish a central role the federal government has played in weather forecasting since the 1800s, which experts say poses a particular harm for those who may not be able to afford commercial weather data. The effort also reveals the difficulty wealthy members of Trump’s Cabinet have in freeing themselves from conflicts, even if they have met the letter of federal ethics law. “It’s the most insidious aspect of this: Are we really talking about making weather products available only to those who can afford it?” said Rick Spinrad, who served as NOAA administrator under President Joe Biden, a Democrat. The Commerce Department said in a statement that Lutnick has “fully complied with the terms of his ethics agreement with respect to divesture and recusals and will continue to do so.” Privatizing weather agencies has been an aim of Republicans. During Trump’s first presidency, he signed a bill to utilize more private weather data. Project 2025, a proposed blueprint for Trump’s second presidency that was co-authored by his budget director, calls for the NOAA to be broken up and for the weather service to “fully commercialize its forecasting operations.” Lutnick is not the only one Trump nominated for a key post with close relationships to companies involved in the gathering of weather data. Trump’s pick to lead the NOAA, Neil Jacobs, was chief atmospheric scientist for Panasonic Weather Solutions and is a proponent of privatization. The president’s nominee for another top NOAA post, Taylor Jordan, is a lobbyist for weather-related clients. Jordan and Jacobs ""will follow the law and rely on the advice of the Department’s ethics counsel in addressing matters involving former clients” if confirmed, the Commerce Department said in its statement. Elon Musk, who spent more than $250 million to help elect Trump, owns a controlling interest in SpaceX and its satellite subsidiary Starlink. Both are regulated by the NOAA’s Office of Space Commerce, which lost about one-third of its staff in layoffs by the Department of Government Efficiency, which Musk created. SpaceX stands to gain through a new generation of private and federally funded weather satellites that would be carried into orbit on its rockets. Though Musk departed Washington after a very public falling out with Trump, the DOGE staffers he hired and the cuts he pushed have largely remained in place. Requests for comment sent to representatives for Musk received no response. Lutnick resigned as CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald upon taking office and began the task of divesting his interests. His two 20-something sons took the reins of his financial empire. But Lutnick's most recent ethics filing stated he was still selling his holdings in the firm. An ethics plan from February states Lutnick would request a waiver allowing him to participate in matters with a “direct and predictable effect” on his family’s business. Securities and Exchange Commission filings, meanwhile, show Lutnick is keeping his stake in Cantor close, transferring them to a son. Cantor spokesperson Erica Chase said Lutnick has had no involvement in running the company since his resignation. “Cantor and its subsidiaries operate in heavily regulated industries, and maintain robust compliance programs to ensure compliance with all applicable laws,” Chase said. Federal officials are barred from making decisions that benefit the business holdings of themselves or their spouses, but that prohibition doesn't extend to their adult children, said Richard Painter, an ethics lawyer in Republican President George W. Bush's administration. Cantor has interests in weather and climate. It owns a controlling interest in BGC Group, which operates a weather derivatives marketplace that essentially allows investors to bet on climate risk and where hurricanes will make landfall. Lutnick also played a pivotal role in cultivating the satellite company Satellogic, which he helped take public and where he held a board seat. Cantor holds a roughly 13% stake in Satellogic, an emerging federal contractor that offers crisp images of natural disasters and weather events in real time. The White House’s 2026 spending plan proposes $8 billion in cuts for future NOAA satellites, which capture imagery of the planet provided to the public. Satellogic stands to benefit if the government retreats from operating climate-monitoring satellites. Jacobs, Trump’s pick to lead the NOAA, was scheduled to appear Wednesday before a Senate committee weighing his nomination. Jacobs has long advocated for a greater role for the private sector in government weather forecasting. During a 2023 congressional hearing focused on the future of the NOAA, he expressed concerns about what happens to commercial data purchased by the government.
