"Australian court rejects X Corp.'s appeal in child safety case, orders legal costs",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/australian-court-rejects-x-corps-appeal-in-child-safety-case-orders-legal-costs-2025-07-31/,"MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — An Australian appeals court on Thursday ruled against X Corp., rejecting a challenge to a safety watchdog's demands for details on how the Elon Musk -owned company was combating widespread child exploitation material on its platform. Three federal court judges unanimously rejected X’s appeal against a federal court decision in October last year that the company was obliged to respond to a notice from eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant on child abuse material being shared on X, which is incorporated in Texas. The judges also ordered X to pay the commissioner’s legal costs. Inman Grant’s office describes itself as the world’s first government agency dedicated to keeping people safe online. Inman Grant has driven world-first legislation that will ban Australian children younger than 16 from social media platforms including X from December. The federal court case goes back to early 2023, when Inman Grant asked some of the world’s largest technology companies to report on what they were doing about child abuse material appearing on their platforms. A reporting notice, issued under Australia’s Online Safety Act, was sent to Twitter Inc., incorporated in Delaware, in February that year. Twitter merged with X the following month. X arguments against complying with Inman Grant’s order included that Twitter no longer existed as a legal entity and that X did not carry its predecessor's regulatory obligations in Australia. Inman Grant, a former Twitter employee, welcomed Thursday’s ruling. “This judgment confirms the obligations to comply with Australian regulations still apply, regardless of a foreign company’s merger with another foreign company,” she said in a statement. She said her agency would continue enforcing the Online Safety Act and “holding all tech companies to account without fear or favor, ensuring they comply with the laws of Australia.” “Without meaningful transparency, we cannot hold technology companies accountable,” she said. X lawyer Justin Quill said he had not yet read the appeals court judges’ reasons and could not comment on the possibility of a High Court appeal. The High Court only hears around 10% of appeal applications, so the federal court full-bench decision could be final in X's case. X’s media office did not immediately respond to an email request for comment on Thursday. In 2023, Inman Grant’s office fined X 610, 500 Australian dollars ($385,000) for failing to fully explain how it tackled child exploitation content. X’s response was considered incomplete or misleading. X refused to pay and the penalty is the subject of a separate and ongoing federal court case.

Asian shares are mixed after South Korea makes tariff deal and US stocks fall,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/asian-shares-are-mixed-after-us-stocks-fall-on-weakened-hopes-for-a-september-interest-rate-cut-2025-07-30/,"MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Asian shares were mixed Thursday after most U.S. stocks slipped, as doubts rose on Wall Street about whether the Federal Reserve will deliver economy-juicing cuts to interest rates by September. Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.9% to 41,020.91 after the Bank of Japan kept interest rates steady at 0.5% and raised inflation projections. The move follows Tokyo’s trade deal with Washington. In Seoul, the Kospi edged down 0.3% to 3,244.40 after South Korea reached a 15% tariff deal with the U.S., with no levies on American goods like cars, trucks and farm products. The deal also includes South Korea's purchase of $100 billion U.S. energy imports and $350 billion worth of investments in the U.S. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index fell 1% to 24,920.67, while the Shanghai Composite Index slid 0.7% to 3,588.73. Australia’s S&P ASX 200 shed 0.1% to 8,743.80. India's BSE Sensex added 0.2% to 81,481.86. Taiwan's TAIEX rose 0.4% to 23,551.92. Rabo Bank, citing the U.S. trade deals with other countries, including Bangladesh, said in a commentary that “it appears to be only a matter of time before India agrees to terms to ensure that it retains favorable access to the US market and all of those other markets that (U.S. President Donald) Trump has demonstrated he has the power to direct through economic coercion.” Rabo added that the terms of a U.S.-India trade deal would almost certainly include Indian purchases of U.S. arms and energy products and preferential access to U.S. agricultural goods. “A potential loser in all of this is Australia. With the US sending more wheat to Indonesia and Bangladesh and more LNG to Japan and South Korea, Australian exports stand to be displaced from their traditional markets,” it added. Trump on Wednesday announced a 25% tariff on imports coming from India, along with an additional tax because of India’s purchases of Russian oil, beginning Friday. That’s when stiff tariffs Trump has proposed for many other countries are also scheduled to kick in, unless they reach trade deals that lower the rates. But the U.S. president said the two countries were still in negotiations. On Wall Street on Wednesday the S&P 500 edged down by 0.1%, coming off its first loss after setting all-time highs for six successive days. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 171 points, or 0.4%, and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.1%. Stocks felt pressure from rising Treasury yields in the bond market after the Federal Reserve voted to hold its main interest rate steady. The move may upset Trump, who has been lobbying for lower interest rates, but it was widely expected on Wall Street. Fed Chair Jerome Powell may have surprised investors by pushing back on expectations that the Fed could cut rates at its next meeting in September. Besides Trump, two members of the Fed’s committee have also been calling for lower rates to ease the pressure on the economy, and they dissented in Wednesday’s vote. But Powell would not commit to a September cut in rates, pointing to how inflation remains above the Fed’s 2% target, while the job market still looks to be “in balance.” A cut in rates would give the job market and overall economy a boost, but it could also risk fueling inflation when Trump’s tariffs may be set to raise prices for U.S. consumers. The Fed’s job is to keep both the job market and inflation in a good place. In other dealings on Thursday, U.S. benchmark crude oil lost 4 cents to $69.96 per barrel while Brent crude, the international standard, shed 13 cents to $72.34 per barrel. The U.S. dollar fell to 148.87 Japanese yen from 149.44. The euro rose to $1.1422 from $1.1412. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

"Day 2 of federal investigation into fatal midair crash of Army chopper, commercial plane opens",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/day-2-of-federal-investigation-into-fatal-midair-crash-of-army-chopper-commercial-plane-opens-2025-07-30/,"The National Transportation Safety Board enters a second day of public hearings Thursday on the January midair collision between an Army Black Hawk helicopter and a passenger plane that killed all 67 people aboard the aircrafts. On the first day, investigators highlighted a number of factors that may have contributed to the crash and the warnings about helicopter traffic that FAA received years before the tragedy over the Potomac River. It’s too early for the board to identify what exactly caused the crash. The board’s final report won’t be released until sometime next year. But it became clear Wednesday how small a margin of error there was for helicopters flying the route the Black Hawk took the night of the nation’s deadliest plane crash since November 2001. The January incident was the first in a string of crashes and near misses this year that have alarmed officials and the traveling public, despite statistics that still show flying remains the safest form of transportation. NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said an FAA working group raised concerns about all the helicopter traffic around Reagan airport and the risk of a collision in 2022, but the FAA refused to add a warning to helicopter charts urging pilots to use caution when this runway was in use. “This is the very event that this would have been the cautionary note for,” she said. Video and animation presented during the proceeding's first day showed the helicopter flying above the 200 feet (61 meters) altitude limit before colliding with the plane. Investigators said Wednesday the flight data recorder showed the helicopter was actually 80 feet to 100 feet (24 to 30 meters) higher than the barometric altimeter the pilots relied upon showed they were flying. So the NTSB conducted tests on three other helicopters from the same unit in a flight over the same area and found similar discrepancies in their altimeters. Dan Cooper with Sikorsky helicopters said that when the Black Hawk helicopter involved in the crash was designed in the 1970s, it used a style of altimeter that was common at the time. Newer helicopters have air data computers that didn’t exist back then that help provide more accurate altitude readings. Chief Warrant Officer Kylene Lewis told the board that she wouldn’t find an 80 to 100 foot discrepancy between the different altimeters on a helicopter alarming because at lower altitudes she would be relying more on the radar altimeter than the barometric altimeter. Below 500 feet (152 meters), Lewis said she would be checking both instruments and cross referencing them. Army officials said a discrepancy of 70 to 100 feet (21 to 30 meters) between the Black Hawk’s altimeters is within the acceptable range because pilots are expected to maintain their altitude plus or minus 100 feet. The greater concern is that the FAA approved routes around Reagan airport that included such small separation distances between helicopters and planes when planes are landing. “The fact that we have less than 500 foot separation is a concern for me,” said Scott Rosengren, who is chief engineer in the office that manages the Army's utility helicopters. During the two minutes before the crash, one air traffic controller was directing airport traffic and helicopters in the area, a task that involved speaking to or receiving communications from several different aircraft, according to the NTSB’s History of Flight Performance Study. The air traffic controller had spoken to or received communications from the Black Hawk helicopter, an airplane that was taking off, an Air Force helicopter, an airplane on the ground, a medical helicopter and an inbound flight that was not the American Airlines plane that would crash. “All aircraft could hear the controller, but helicopters could only hear other helicopters on their frequency and airplanes only other airplanes,” the report stated. “This resulted in a number of stepped on transmissions as helicopters and airplanes were not aware when the other was communicating.” Stepped on transmissions are those that are unheard or blocked because of other transmissions. The NTSB report provides a list of 29 separate communications between the airport tower and other aircraft during approximately the 1 minute and 57 seconds before the collision. Previously disclosed air traffic control audio had the helicopter pilot telling the controller twice that they saw the airplane and would avoid it. The animation ended with surveillance video showing the helicopter colliding with the plane in a fiery crash. Investigations have already shown the FAA failed to recognize a troubling history of 85 near misses around Ronald Reagan National Airport in the years before the collision, and that the Army’s helicopters routinely flew around the nation’s capital with a key piece of locating equipment, known as ADS-B Out, turned off. ___ Associated Press writers Leah Askarinam, Ben Finley and Rio Yamat contributed to this story.

Chinese researchers suggest lasers and sabotage to counter Musk’s Starlink satellites,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/chinese-researchers-suggest-lasers-and-sabotage-to-counter-musks-starlink-satellites-2025-07-30/,"ROME (AP) — Stealth submarines fitted with space-shooting lasers, supply-chain sabotage and custom-built attack satellites armed with ion thrusters. Those are just some of the strategies Chinese scientists have been developing to counter what Beijing sees as a potent threat: Elon Musk’ s armada of Starlink communications satellites. Chinese government and military scientists, concerned about Starlink’s potential use by adversaries in a military confrontation and for spying, have published dozens of papers in public journals that explore ways to hunt and destroy Musk’s satellites, an Associated Press review found. Chinese researchers believe that Starlink — a vast constellation of low-orbit satellites that deliver cheap, fast and ubiquitous connectivity even in remote areas — poses a high risk to the Chinese government and its strategic interests. That fear has mostly been driven by the company’s close ties to the U.S. intelligence and defense establishment, as well as its growing global footprint. “As the United States integrates Starlink technology into military space assets to gain a strategic advantage over its adversaries, other countries increasingly perceive Starlink as a security threat in nuclear, space, and cyber domains,” wrote professors from China’s National University of Defense Technology in a 2023 paper. Chinese researchers are not the only ones concerned about Starlink, which has a stranglehold on certain space-based communications. Some traditional U.S. allies are also questioning the wisdom of handing over core communications infrastructure — and a potential trove of data — to a company run by an unpredictable foreign businessman whose allegiances are not always clear. Apprehensions deepened after Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine made clear the battlefield advantages Starlink satellites could convey and have been exacerbated by Musk’s proliferating political interests. Musk pumped tens of millions of dollars into President Donald Trump’s reelection effort and emerged, temporarily, as a key adviser and government official. As Musk toys with the idea of starting his own political party, he has also taken an increasing interest in European politics, using his influence to promote an array of hard-right and insurgent figures often at odds with establishment politicians. Musk left the Trump administration in May and within days his relationship with Trump publicly imploded in a feud on social media. SpaceX, the rocket launch and space-based communications company that Musk founded and that operates Starlink, remains inextricably linked with core U.S. government functions. It has won billions in contracts to provide launch services for NASA missions and military satellites, recuperate astronauts stranded at the International Space Station and build a network of spy satellites for the National Reconnaissance Office. Starlink's space dominance has sparked a global scramble to come up with viable alternatives. But its crushing first-mover advantage has given SpaceX near monopoly power, further complicating the currents of business, politics and national security that converge on Musk and his companies. Since its first launches in 2019, Starlink has come to account for about two-thirds of all active satellites, according to Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who writes a newsletter tracking satellite launches. SpaceX operates more than 8,000 active satellites and eventually aims to deploy tens of thousands more. Beijing’s tendency to view Starlink as tool of U.S. military power has sharpened its efforts to develop countermeasures — which, if deployed, could increase the risk of collateral damage to other customers as SpaceX expands its global footprint. The same satellites that pass over China also potentially serve Europe, Ukraine, the United States and other geographies as they continue their path around the earth. Starlink says it operates in more than 140 countries, and recently made inroads in Vietnam, Niger, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Pakistan. In June, Starlink also obtained a license to operate in India, overcoming national security concerns and powerful domestic telecom interests to crack open a tech-savvy market of nearly 1.5 billion people. On the company’s own map of coverage, it has very few dead zones beyond those in North Korea, Iran and China. No other country or company is close to catching up with Starlink. Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos has taken aim at rival Musk with Project Kuiper, which launched its first batch of internet satellites into orbit in April. So far Amazon has just 78 satellites in orbit, with 3,232 planned, according to McDowell, and London-based Eutelstat OneWeb has around 650 satellites in orbit, a fraction of the fleet it had initially planned. The European Union is spending billions to develop its own satellite array — called the IRIS2 initiative — but remains woefully behind. EU officials have had to lobby their own member states not to sign contracts with Starlink while it gets up and running. “We are allies with the United States of America, but we need to have our strategic autonomy,” said Christophe Grudler, a French member of the European Parliament who led legislative work on IRIS2. “The risk is not having our destiny in our own hands.” China has been public about its ambition to build its own version of Starlink to meet both domestic national security needs and compete with Starlink in foreign markets. In 2021, Beijing established the state-owned China SatNet company and tasked it with launching a megaconstellation with military capabilities, known as Guowang. In December, the company launched its first operational satellites, and now has 60 of a planned 13,000 in orbit, according to McDowell. Qianfan, a company backed by the Shanghai government, has launched 90 satellites out of some 15,000 planned. The Brazilian government in November announced a deal with Qianfan, after Musk had a scorching public fight with a Brazilian judge investigating X, who also froze Space X’s bank accounts in the country. Qianfan is also targeting customers in Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Oman, Pakistan and Uzbekistan and has ambitions to expand across the African continent, according to a slide presented at a space industry conference last year and published by the China Space Monitor. Concerns about Starlink’s supremacy were supercharged by Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The war was a turning point in strategic thinking about Starlink and similar systems. Ukraine used the Starlink network to facilitate battlefield communications and power fighter and reconnaissance drones, providing a decisive ground-game advantage. At the same time, access to the satellites was initially controlled by a single man, Musk, who can — and did — interrupt critical services, refusing, for example, to extend coverage to support a Ukrainian counterattack in Russia-occupied Crimea. U.S.-led sanctions against Moscow after the full-scale invasion also curtailed the availability of Western technology in Russia, underscoring the geopolitical risks inherent in relying on foreign actors for access to critical infrastructure. “Ukraine was a warning shot for the rest of us,” said Nitin Pai, co-founder and director of the Takshashila Institution, a public policy research center based in Bangalore, India. “For the last 20 years, we were quite aware of the fact that giving important government contracts to Chinese companies is risky because Chinese companies operate as appendages of the Chinese Communist Party. Therefore, it’s a risk because the Chinese Communist Party can use technology as a lever against you. Now it’s no different with the Americans.” Nearly all of the 64 papers about Starlink reviewed by AP in Chinese journals were published after the conflict started. Starlink’s omnipresence and potential military applications have unnerved Beijing and spurred the nation’s scientists to action. In paper after paper, researchers painstakingly assessed the capabilities and vulnerabilities of a network that they clearly perceive as menacing and strove to understand what China might learn — and emulate — from Musk’s company as Beijing works to develop a similar satellite system. Though Starlink does not operate in China, Musk’s satellites nonetheless can sweep over Chinese territory. Researchers from China’s National Defense University in 2023 simulated Starlink’s coverage of key geographies, including Beijing, Taiwan, and the polar regions, and determined that Starlink can achieve round-the-clock coverage of Beijing. “The Starlink constellation coverage capacity of all regions in the world is improving steadily and in high speed,” they concluded. In another paper — this one published by the government-backed China Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team — researchers mapped out vulnerabilities in Starlink’s supply chain. “The company has more than 140 first-tier suppliers and a large number of second-tier and third-tier suppliers downstream,” they wrote in a 2023 paper. “The supervision for cybersecurity is limited.” Engineers from the People’s Liberation Army, in another 2023 paper, suggested creating a fleet of satellites to tail Starlink satellites, collecting signals and potentially using corrosive materials to damage their batteries or ion thrusters to interfere with their solar panels. Other Chinese academics have encouraged Beijing to use global regulations and diplomacy to contain Musk, even as the nation’s engineers have continued to elaborate active countermeasures: Deploy small optical telescopes already in commercial production to monitor Starlink arrays. Concoct deep fakes to create fictitious targets. Shoot powerful lasers to burn Musk’s equipment. Some U.S. analysts say Beijing’s fears may be overblown, but such assessments appear to have done little to cool domestic debate.

Ranchers say expanding herds to take advantage of record retail beef prices isn't so simple,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/ranchers-say-expanding-herds-to-take-advantage-of-record-retail-beef-prices-isnt-so-simple-2025-07-30/,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — In a period when retail beef prices are at an all-time high and consumers are still willing to pay, South Dakota rancher Calli Williams would love to cash in. But it's not so simple. Williams and her husband, Tate, raise about 70 cow-calf pairs near Letcher in southeastern South Dakota, roughly 18 miles (29 kilometers) north of Mitchell. They own about 80 acres (32 hectares) and rent additional pasture. Between the drought that hit cattle country hard over the last few years, still being maxed out on the grass available to feed their animals, and with land prices rising, she said, they simply can’t yet make the financial investments that they’d need to raise production. “It is a goal of ours to expand,” she said. “I’m just not sure if that will be in the 10-year plan or even longer.” Farmers and ranchers across the U.S. would love to take greater advantage of the high prices, but with the U.S. herd at record lows, they can’t meet the demand quickly. It's basic biology. “It takes three years to get more cows — between making a decision, having that gestation period, having the calf born, raising the calf until it, too, can have a calf,"" said Michael Swanson, chief agricultural economist for the Wells Fargo Agri-Food Institute in Minneapolis. The Williamses' county was hard hit by drought over the previous few seasons. Because of the lack of their grass and uneconomically high hay prices, they had to sell all their young females last year that could have produced more calves for them this year, she said. Their area has caught some rain lately, though. It has improved to just “abnormally dry” in recent U.S. Drought Monitor reports. But Williams said they’re simply playing catch-up. Swanson said some of the main cattle areas in North America — from Saskatchewan and Manitoba in Canada down to Texas in the U.S. — are just naturally prone to drought. It's often boom or bust. Colin Woodall, CEO of the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, said a lot of cattle country has had good rain this summer, but it's a cyclical business. “Sometimes we have good times, and sometimes we don’t,” Woodall said. “And we are just coming off what was a pretty significant negative hit to the cattle industry in ’19, ’20 and ’21, with the height of the pandemic. So we have a lot of producers who are still trying to pay off bills from those times."" And Woodall said his members are still leery. They're asking how long the better weather will last. “We’re getting some good moisture now. But will it be that way in the fall? Will it be that way next year?” he said. “Because the last thing you want to do is pay to rebuild your herd and then just have to liquidate them again in six months to a year.” Although it’s difficult to attribute any single weather event, such as a drought, directly to climate change, scientists say that rising temperatures stoked by climate change are increasing the odds of both severe droughts and heavier precipitation, which wreak havoc on people and the environment. When extreme weather collides with tight margins, farmers and ranchers feel the squeeze. Retail beef prices have hit record highs with no relief for consumers in sight. Ground beef rose to an average of $6.12 per pound in June, up nearly 12% from 2024. The average price of all steaks rose 8% to $11.49 per pound. And the average prices that producers receive for cattle and calves have increased from $1.51 per pound in May 2020 to $4.05 in May of this year. The total U.S. cattle herd is the smallest it has been at midyear since the government began keeping those figures in 1973, and probably since the 1950s. There were few signs in the U.S. Department of Agriculture data released last Friday that producers have begun rebuilding herds. As of July 1, the U.S. had 94.2 million cattle and calves, down from the last midyear peak in 2019 of nearly 103 million. Critical for the future supply, 2025 calf production is projected at 33.1 million head, down 1% from last year. Derrell Peel, a livestock marketing specialist at Oklahoma State University, said if producers were planning to grow their herds, the USDA reports would have shown them keeping heifers — female cows that haven’t given birth yet. While retail prices are high, consumers so far have been willing to pay them. Glynn Tonsor, who leads the Meat Demand Monitor at Kansas State University, said taste is the most important consideration when shoppers choose proteins — and beef remains the favorite. The late June report found that consumers were willing to fork out $17.62 a pound for rib-eye steaks and $8.82 for a pound of ground beef. That’s more than the $7.13 they’d pay for pork chops, $6.19 for bacon, or $8.55 for chicken breasts. A major reason, Woodall offered, is that the beef industry has focused on the eating experience. “The kind of beef that we are producing today is some of the highest quality, best tasting beef that we’ve ever produced in history here in the United States,"" he said. “So, things such as USDA prime graded steaks that at one point in time you could only get in a restaurant, you can now get that in a grocery store.” For consumers who balk at costs, the marketing specialist Peel said, pork and poultry are “abundant and quite favorably priced."" The Williamses, who are both 34, built their TW Angus business from scratch. Tate Williams started buying cattle when he was in high school, and they bought their land in 2015. They sell bulls in the spring and keep heifers when they can. They also raise steers in their own feedlot and sell the meat directly to consumers. “We would really like to expand our operation,"" Calli Williams said. ""We have a goal of being able to pass this on to the next generation,” Williams said, meaning their sons Jack, 7, and Tommy, nearly 4. But recalling a friend’s words, she said ranchers are a resilient bunch. “We’re optimistic that if Mother Nature — she wreaked havoc on us, whether that was a drought or a flood — that next year she’ll be kinder to us, “ she said. ”Or, if the markets weren’t on our side, we’re optimistic that the markets will be on our side next time.” Before you consider Wells Fargo & Company, you'll want to hear this.

"Visa Beats Q3 Earnings Expectations, So Why Did the Market Panic?",https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/visa-beats-q3-earnings-expectations-so-why-did-the-market-panic/,"Visa NYSE: V is a dominant player in the worldwide payments industry, and even amid macroeconomic difficulties, the stock has delivered impressive performance in 2025 so far. As of the July 29 market close, Visa shares have provided a year-to-date (YTD) total return of more than 11%, moderately surpassing the approximately 9% total return of the S&P 500 Index. However, the company’s July 29 earnings release weighed on the stock. Although the firm beat expectations on both sales and earnings in the quarter, V stock fell by 2%-3% in after-hours trading. So, what caused markets to sell the stock after the results? And how does this impact Visa stock going forward? In its fiscal Q3 2025 results, Visa reported revenues of just under $10.20 billion, equating to 14% revenue growth. This solidly beat estimates of around 11% growth. The company also noted impressive adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.98, a 23% increase, beating the analyst estimate of 17%. However, Q4 guidance may have been responsible for the after-hours sell-off. The company forecasts “high-single-digit to low-double-digit” revenue growth in Q4, and sees EPS growing in the “high single-digit range."" These figures appear to be less than what analysts were hoping for. Payment volume growth, a key business driver, remained solid at 8% in constant currency. It remained stable compared to the prior year quarter and to fiscal Q2 2025, indicating that trade wars are not having much of a negative impact on consumers so far in 2025. The company called consumer spending ""resilient."" As Visa’s payment-driven business thrives on consumer health, this is good news for Visa investors. It is also good news for the overall market since consumer spending accounts for around two-thirds of the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP). The company’s value-added services (VAS) saw robust growth of 26% in constant currency, a solid acceleration from 22% growth last quarter. This is another positive sign, as VAS is also a key growth driver and increases the stickiness of Visa’s platform, helping solidify its market position. Management said VAS is “firing on all cylinders."" In general, Visa’s business remains healthy, with strong growth across key verticals, supporting the continued bullish thesis around the stock, as the company is well-positioned to benefit from long-term economic growth. Visa added notable color to two key initiatives, Visa Direct and stablecoins. Visa Direct is the company’s remittance platform. It enables foreign workers to send money back to their families in their home country. Banks and other financial institutions integrate Visa Direct into their platforms. Overall, Visa Direct saw a 25% increase in transactions and added several new banks to the platform during the quarter. The company's substantial progress on this front is key. Visa sees cross-border transactions as a relatively under-penetrated, enormous total addressable market (TAM). Thus, Visa Direct is a way for the company to drive strong growth for an extended period. The company thinks stablecoins will also be beneficial for capitalizing on this opportunity. The firm sees stablecoins as benefiting two key areas. The first is in emerging market economies, where local currencies can be volatile and people have limited access to U.S. dollars. Consumers and businesses may prefer to hold stablecoins tied to the U.S. dollar or euros, helping their money maintain its value. To capitalize on this opportunity, Visa is expanding its offerings of stablecoin-linked cards. The company is working to integrate stablecoins into Visa Direct. While Visa Direct often works well on its own, stablecoins can occasionally facilitate faster cross-border money movement. Early testing results have been good. Despite the drop in shares after hours, Visa remains a hard stock to bet against. Its long-term strength lies in its global scale, technological readiness, and forward-looking strategy. By combining resilient core payment demand with innovation in tokenization and stablecoin-enabled services, the company is expanding its addressable market while reinforcing platform loyalty. The conservative guidance may reflect prudence amid macro uncertainties, but it doesn’t undercut Visa’s strategic momentum. As more ways to pay emerge, Visa will likely be there and make money from them, adding significant weight to the finance stock’s bullish thesis. Before you consider Visa, you'll want to hear this.

Trump calls GOP's Hawley 'second tier' senator after bill to ban stock trades in government advances,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-calls-gops-hawley-second-tier-senator-after-stock-trading-ban-bill-advances-2025-07-30/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump lashed out at Sen. Josh Hawley on Wednesday after the Republican's proposal to ban stock trading by members of Congress — and the president and vice president — won bipartisan approval to advance in a committee vote. It’s the second time in as many days that Trump laid into senators in his own party as the president tries, sometimes without success, to publicly pressure them to fall in line. A day earlier, Trump tore into veteran GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa over an obscure Senate procedure regarding nominations. Trump called Hawley a “second-tier Senator” who was playing into the hands of Democrats. “I don’t think real Republicans want to see their President, who has had unprecedented success, TARGETED, because of the 'whims' of a second-tier Senator named Josh Hawley!” GOP senators had been working with the White House on the stock trade bill, and some supported a broad carve-out to exclude the president from the ban, but it failed, with Hawley joining Democrats to block it. Trump complained that Hawley joined with Democrats to block another amendment that would have investigated the stock trades of Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the speaker emerita, and her spouse. Paul Pelosi has been a much-watched trader, but Pelosi’s office said she personally does not own stock. Hawley did not immediately respond to Trump’s post. But Hawley’s legislation with the panel’s top Democrat, Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan, sailed out of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, after his support delivered a bipartisan vote over the objections of the other Republicans, who have majority control. In a joint statement, Hawley and Peters said the legislation, called the Honest Act, builds on an earlier bill and would ban members of Congress, the president, vice president and their spouses from holding, buying or selling stock. An earlier proposal from Hawley had focused more narrowly on lawmakers. “We have an opportunity here today to do something that the public has wanted to do for decades,” Hawley told the panel. “And that is to ban members of Congress from profiting on information that frankly only members of Congress have on the buying and selling of stock.” Stock trading by members of Congress has long been an issue that the parties have tried to tackle, especially as some elected officials have become wealthy while in elected office. During the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular, it was disclosed that lawmakers were trading as information about the health crisis became known. Insider trading laws don’t always apply to the types of information lawmakers receive. If the bill were to become law, it would immediately prohibit elected officials, including the president, from buying stocks and would ban them from selling stocks for 90 days after enactment. It also requires the elected officials to divest from all covered investments, but not until starting at the beginning of their next term in office — shielding Trump from that requirement. During the committee hearing, tensions flared as Republicans sought other approaches. GOP Sen. Rick Scott of Florida proposed one amendment that would exempt the president, the vice president, their spouses and dependent children from the legislation, and the other one that would have required a report on the Pelosi family's trades. Both were defeated, with Hawley joining the Democrats. “We are one step closer to getting this bill passed into law and finally barring bad actors from taking advantage of their positions for their own financial gain,” Peters said in a statement. Pelosi said she strongly supports the bill and looks forward to voting for it. “The American people deserve confidence that their elected leaders are serving the public interest — not their personal portfolios,” she said. She also gave nod to the dig in the initial Republican proposal — the Preventing Elected Leaders from Owning Securities and Investments, or Pelosi Act — which had focused more narrowly on the lawmakers. One Republican, Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, said the overall bill is “legislative demagoguery.” “We do have insider trading laws. We have financial disclosure. Trust me, we have financial disclosure,” Johnson said. “So I don’t see the necessity of this.” Trump’s post criticizing Hawley comes after a similar blowback directed Tuesday night at Grassley. In that post, Trump pressured Grassley to do away with the Senate's longtime “blue slip” custom that often forces bipartisan support on presidential nominations of federal judges. The practice requires both senators in a state to agree to push a nominee forward for a vote. Trump told Grassley to do away with the practice. “Senator Grassley must step up,” Trump said, while claiming that he helped the senator, who was first elected in 1980, to win reelection. Grassley earlier Wednesday said he was “offended” by what the president said. ___ Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

How Marvell Went From Short Target to Breakout Star,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/how-marvell-went-from-short-target-to-breakout-star/,"Marvell Technology NASDAQ: MRVL, a company that experienced underperformance and became a favorite among short-selling skeptics through the first half of 2025, has recently demonstrated a significant shift in momentum. Over the past five days, the stock has begun to recover, and in the final days of July, it has shown breakout momentum, signaling an apparent change in narrative. What was once a target for short-sellers has now captured market attention with what looks like the start of a powerful rally. This raises a crucial question for investors: What is driving the shift in market sentiment? For Marvell, the answer lies in a foundation of strong business results, suddenly ignited by a specific, confidence-boosting catalyst. Before the market-moving headlines of July 30, Marvell had already laid a foundation of strong fundamental performance. On July 24, the company released a preliminary report on its second-quarter fiscal 2026 results, signaling to the market that its business was running ahead of schedule. The full Q2 earnings report is expected after market close on Aug. 27. Management announced it expected revenue and earnings to finish at the high end of its previously guided range, implying revenue approaching or exceeding $2.1 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) at or above 72 cents. The company attributed this strength to two key factors. First, demand for its data center products, particularly those related to artificial intelligence (AI), accelerated faster than anticipated. This confirmed that its primary growth engine was performing at a high level. Second, management noted that the long-standing inventory correction in its enterprise networking business was finally showing signs of concluding. The stabilization de-risks the company's financial profile and provides a firmer foundation, allowing Marvell's high-growth AI story to drive overall results. That spark arrived on July 30. The primary trigger for the stock price jump on that day was a bullish sell-side report that, according to market commentary, specifically addressed and increased investor confidence in Marvell's custom-chip relationship with Microsoft NASDAQ: MSFT. The news directly countered the narrative of doubt that had weighed on the stock. Before the rally, Marvell was known as a favorite short play in some hedge fund circles, with uncertainty around its major customer programs being a primary reason for the skepticism. The positive analyst note directly targeted this concern, effectively neutralizing a key part of the bearish argument. This sentiment shift was accompanied by a tangible market signal from Morgan Stanley, which raised its price target on the stock from $73.00 to $80.00. The market’s reaction was immediate and powerful. After closing the previous day at $76.34, Marvell's stock gapped up at the open, beginning the trading day at $83.11. This type of significant price gap is a classic sign of overwhelming pre-market demand, typically driven by large institutions acting decisively on new information. The high trading volume throughout the day confirmed this was a broad-based move, suggesting a significant re-evaluation of the stock was underway. The rally did not happen in a vacuum. The company's strong underlying performance fully supports the newfound confidence sparked by the analyst report. The market's strong reaction on July 30 was a direct and logical consequence of investors finally digesting the solid fundamental news revealed just days earlier. This near-term execution fits perfectly within the company's long-term strategic vision. Marvell's goal is to capture 20% of the custom AI chip market by 2028, an objective that would dramatically reshape its revenue profile. The stronger-than-expected preliminary Q2 results and the renewed confidence in its key customer relationships serve as powerful, real-time proof points that this long-term plan is an achievable reality. Further bolstering its strategic position, Marvell recently appointed Rajiv Ramaswami, the current CEO of cloud software leader Nutanix, to its Board of Directors. This move adds a wealth of relevant cloud ecosystem and software expertise to Marvell's leadership, further aligning the company with the needs of its most important customers and strengthening its strategic vision for the future. The recent jump in Marvell's stock price represents what appears to be a significant sentiment reversal. A foundation of strong business results, ignited by a specific, confidence-shifting catalyst, has allowed the stock to break free from the skepticism that previously held it back. This positions the company as a potentially undervalued architect of the future of the AI Revolution. Before you consider Marvell Technology, you'll want to hear this.

Judge orders Trump administration to explain why order to restore Voice of America wasn't followed,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/judge-orders-trump-administration-to-explain-why-order-to-restore-voice-of-america-wasnt-followed-2025-07-30/,"A federal judge on Wednesday essentially accused the Trump administration of ignoring his orders to restore Voice of America's operations and explain clearly what it is doing with the government-run operation that provides news to other countries. U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth of the District of Columbia gave the administration until Aug. 13 to explain how it will get VOA working again. The outlet that dates back to World War II has been largely dark since March. Lamberth said the administration needs to show what it is doing with the $260 million Congress appropriated for VOA's operations this year. Kari Lake, the adviser appointed by Trump to run the government news agencies, said in June that 85% of employees at VOA and its overseers at the U.S. Agency for Global Media had lost their jobs. She called it a “long overdue effort to dismantle a bloated, unaccountable bureaucracy.” Lamberth said there's a process for eliminating funding that had previously been appropriated — Congress must vote on it, as it recently did for NPR and PBS funding. But that hasn't happened here, he said. He scolded the administration for providing “cagey answers” and omitting key information when asked for it in previous court orders. “Without more explanation, the court is left to conclude that the defendants are simply trying to run out the clock on the fiscal year, without putting the money Congress appropriated toward the purposes Congress intended,” Lamberth wrote. “The legal term for that is ‘waste.’” There was no immediate comment from the White House. ___ David Bauder writes about the intersection of media and entertainment for the AP.

"Triumphant in trade talks, Trump and his tariffs still face a challenge in federal court",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/triumphant-in-trade-talks-trump-and-his-tariffs-still-face-a-challenge-in-federal-court-2025-07-30/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has been getting his way on trade, strong-arming the European Union, Japan and other partners to accept once unthinkably high taxes on their exports to the United States. But his radical overhaul of American trade policy, in which he's bypassed Congress to slam big tariffs on most of the world's economies, has not gone unchallenged. He's facing at least seven lawsuits charging that he's overstepped his authority. The plaintiffs want his biggest, boldest tariffs thrown out. And they won Round One. In May, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of International Trade, a specialized federal court in New York, ruled that Trump exceeded his powers when he declared a national emergency to plaster taxes — tariffs — on imports from almost every country in the world. In reaching its decision, the court combined two challenges — one by five businesses and one by 12 U.S. states — into a single case. Now it goes on to Round Two. On Thursday, the 11 judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, which typically specializes in patent law, are scheduled to hear oral arguments from the Trump administration and from the states and businesses that want his sweeping import taxes struck down. That court earlier allowed the federal government to continue collecting Trump’s tariffs as the case works its way through the judicial system. The issues are so weighty — involving the president’s power to bypass Congress and impose taxes with huge economic consequences in the United States and abroad — that the case is widely expected to reach the U.S. Supreme Court, regardless of what the appeals court decides. Trump is an unabashed fan of tariffs. He sees the import taxes as an all-purpose economic tool that can bring manufacturing back to the United States, protect American industries, raise revenue to pay for the massive tax cuts in his “One Big Beautiful Bill,’’ pressure countries into bending to his will, even end wars. The U.S. Constitution gives the power to impose taxes — including tariffs — to Congress. But lawmakers have gradually relinquished power over trade policy to the White House. And Trump has made the most of the power vacuum, raising the average U.S. tariff to more than 18%, highest since 1934, according to the Budget Lab at Yale University. At issue in the pending court case is Trump’s use of the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose sweeping tariffs without seeking congressional approval or conducting investigations first. Instead, he asserted the authority to declare a national emergency that justified his import taxes. In February, he cited the illegal flow of drugs and immigrants across the U.S. border to slap tariffs on Canada, China and Mexico. Then on April 2 — “Liberation Day,’’ Trump called it — he invoked IEEPA to announce “reciprocal’’ tariffs of up to 50% on countries with which the United States ran trade deficits and a 10% “baseline’’ tariff on almost everybody else. The emergency he cited was America's long-running trade deficit. Trump later suspended the reciprocal tariffs, but they remain a threat: They could be imposed again Friday on countries that do not pre-empt them by reaching trade agreements with the United States or that receive letters from Trump setting their tariff rates himself. The plaintiffs argue that the emergency power laws does not authorize the use of tariffs. They also note that the trade deficit hardly meets the definition of an “unusual and extraordinary’’ threat that would justify declaring an emergency under the law. The United States, after all, has run trade deficits — in which it buys more from foreign countries than it sells them — for 49 straight years and in good times and bad. The Trump administration argues that courts approved President Richard Nixon’s emergency use of tariffs in a 1971 economic crisis. The Nixon administration successfully cited its authority under the 1917 Trading With Enemy Act, which preceded and supplied some of the legal language used in IEEPA. In May, the trade court rejected the argument, ruling that Trump’s Liberation Day tariffs “exceed any authority granted to the President’’ under the emergency powers law. “The president doesn’t get to use open-ended grants of authority to do what he wants,’’ said Reilly Stephens, senior counsel at the Liberty Justice Center, a libertarian legal group that is representing businesses suing the Trump administration over the tariffs. In the case of the drug trafficking and immigration tariffs on Canada, China and Mexico, the trade court ruled that the levies did not meet IEEPA’s requirement that they “deal with’’ the problem they were supposed to address. The court challenge does not cover other Trump tariffs, including levies on foreign steel, aluminum and autos that the president imposed after Commerce Department investigations concluded that those imports were threats to U.S. national security. Nor does it include tariffs that Trump imposed on China in his first term — and President Joe Biden kept — after a government investigation concluded that the Chinese used unfair practices to give their own technology firms an edge over rivals from the United States and other Western countries.

"Unsettled by NYC shooting, companies wonder if their offices are safe",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/unsettled-by-nyc-shooting-companies-wonder-if-their-offices-are-safe-2025-07-30/,"NEW YORK (AP) — Businesses around the country are reevaluating security after a brazen shooting at a New York City office building raised questions about what it takes to keep workplaces safe. The attack on a seemingly secure building — in a gilded part of Manhattan where the rich live in sprawling apartments and tourists window-shop designer stores — has rattled workers and prompted managers to examine whether they are adequately protected. “What should we be doing different?” clients are asking, said Brian Higgins, founder of Group 77, a Mahwah, New Jersey, security company that is among those getting peppered with an influx of calls. “How can we prevent something like this?” The gut reaction of some companies, Higgins said, is to buy the latest technology and blanket their workplace in cameras. But, he cautioned, that's only only effective if paired with consistency and long-term monitoring. “If you’re going to add a security measure … you have to make sure you maintain it,” said Higgins, a former police chief who teaches security at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. Four people were killed in the shooting Monday before the gunman died by suicide. Images of the shooter, toting a long rifle on a street in the biggest U.S. city, then terrorizing an office building, have companies desperate to do something to keep the scene from repeating. “People are frightened, people are asking questions,” said Dave Komendat, the Seattle-based chief security officer at Corporate Security Advisors, where calls are also spiking. With the U.S. locked in a pattern of gun violence virtually unparalleled in the world, security firms are used to the rhythms of the business. While attacks at a corporate office are less commonplace, a major shooting or an attack on an executive focuses attention back on security for a time, before receding. “Give it a couple weeks, a month or so, it’ll go back,” Higgins said of the increased call volume. “When security issues don’t happen for a while and companies start reexamining their budget, security is one of those things that companies cut.” Gene Petrino, CEO of Survival Response in Coral Springs, Florida, has also seen an uptick in calls from potential new customers, but expects it to be fleeting. “When things are calm it’s seen as an expense they don’t need right away,” he said, “and then when a tragedy happens it’s a priority again.” Petrino said companies can make changes that aren’t intrusive like using cameras with artificial intelligence capabilities to identify weapons. Sometimes, it may just be a matter of improving lighting in a hallway or putting up convex mirrors to see around a corner. “Everything doesn’t have to be bulletproof and locked with security cameras everywhere,” he said. “You don’t have to be Fort Knox. You can have very basic things.” Michael Evanoff, chief security officer of Verkada, a building security company based in San Mateo, California, said technology like AI-enabled cameras to help identify threats have become even more important amid a shortage of guards. “It’s harder than many realize to find and retain trained personnel,” Evanoff said. “That makes it even more essential that guards are equipped with technology that can extend their reach.” Security at 345 Park Avenue, the site of the shooting, included a New York Police Department officer working a uniformed security assignment. He was among those killed. Rudin, the leasing company that manages the building, did not respond to a query about when the building will reopen or whether new security measures will be implemented. No matter what, though, every workplace has vulnerabilities. “The security team has to be perfect to 100% of the time,” said Komendat, a former chief security officer for Boeing. “Someone like this just needs to be lucky once.” Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

Recall issued over energy drinks mistakenly containing vodka,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/recall-issued-over-energy-drinks-mistakenly-containing-vodka-2025-07-30/,"MODESTO, Calif. (AP) — Energy drinks that mistakenly contain vodka are being recalled in half a dozen states. High Noon is recalling two production lots of High Noon Beach Variety packs because some packs include cans containing vodka that were mislabeled as Celsius Astro Vibe Energy Drink, according to a U.S. Food and Drug Administration recall notice Wednesday. The cans contain vodka seltzer and were mislabeled as “sparkling blue razz”-flavored Celsius Astro Vibe energy drinks, the notice said. Consumption of the liquid in the cans will result in “unintentional alcohol ingestion,” the company said. The packs were distributed to retailers in Florida, New York, Ohio, South Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin. The recall was initiated after the company discovered that a shared packaging supplier mistakenly shipped empty Celsius energy drink cans to High Noon. No illnesses or adverse events have been reported related to the labeling error, according to the company. Consumers who purchased the beverages with the impacted codes found in the recall notice should dispose of it, the notice said. Consumers are also encouraged to make sure any Sparkling Blue Razz Celsius Astro Vibe energy drinks do not contain the specific lot codes in the notice before drinking them.

Palo Alto Networks: The All‑in‑One Cybersecurity Powerhouse,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/palo-alto-networks-the-allinone-cybersecurity-powerhouse/,"The technology sector is in a constant state of transformation. The rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and the shift to multi-cloud environments have created immense opportunities, but they have also opened the door to a more complex and dangerous generation of cyber threats. For years, enterprises fought back by deploying a patchwork of individual security tools, leading to a complicated and often ineffective defense. Today, that approach is changing. Businesses are now demanding simplification, seeking to consolidate their security with a single, integrated platform. This market shift has created a significant opportunity for a definitive leader to emerge, and Palo Alto Networks NASDAQ: PANW is making a compelling case that it will be that leader. Palo Alto Networks' core strategy hinges on a concept it calls platformization. The goal is to provide a single, unified platform that can replace dozens of separate security products, giving businesses a clearer and more effective way to manage their defenses. This strategy is built on three main pillars that cover the entire IT environment: This platform approach is being actively executed through strategic partnerships and acquisitions. To dominate the crucial new market of AI security, the company recently completed its acquisition of Protect AI on July 22, 2025. This move directly integrates AI model scanning and runtime protection into its Prisma platform, giving customers a secure way to adopt new AI technologies. Further, a recent expansion of its partnership with identity leader Okta NASDAQ: OKTA on July 15, 2025, allows for the unification of security and user identity, enabling automated threat responses that competitors with siloed products cannot easily match. This strategy is gaining traction, with the company securing 19 new platformization deals in its most recent quarter, proving that customers are buying into its unified vision. A successful strategy must translate into strong financial results, and Palo Alto Networks' financials are delivering. The company is proving that its platform-centric model is fueling a successful transition to a more predictable, high-growth business profile. Its Next-Generation Security (NGS) Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) is the most compelling evidence of this success. This metric, which tracks performance in high-growth areas like cloud security and AI-driven operations, surged 34% year-over-year to reach $5.1 billion as of April 30, 2025. This healthy growth confirms a successful shift from reliance on traditional hardware sales to a more durable software and subscription-based model. This is supported by impressive top-line performance. The company's total revenue grew 15.3% to $2.3 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2025, beating analyst expectations. Perhaps most impressively, Palo Alto Networks has delivered 12 consecutive quarters of positive GAAP net income, showcasing a rare and valuable combination of high growth and sustained profitability at scale. A company with ambitions to lead a market must sometimes make bold moves, and Palo Alto Networks appears ready to make its biggest one yet. Recent reports indicate the company is in advanced talks to acquire identity security leader CyberArk for a price that could exceed $20 billion. While the company has not confirmed the deal, such a move would be a decisive step toward creating a truly end-to-end cybersecurity platform. Integrating CyberArk’s best-in-class identity security would significantly widen Palo Alto's competitive moat. While the market reacted with some short-term caution to the rumored price tag, the long-term strategic benefit is clear. The move underscores the company's commitment to its platform vision. This ambition is reflected in the stock's premium valuation, with a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) that stands above 110. Such a valuation indicates that investors have high expectations for future growth, a belief that appears to be shared by Wall Street. The stock currently holds a Moderate Buy consensus rating from 41 analysts, with an average price target of $209.42. This confidence is rooted in the company's proven ability to execute its strategy and consistently deliver strong financial results. Palo Alto Networks has established a clear and aggressive strategy to dominate the consolidating cybersecurity market. The company backs its platform vision with decisive acquisitions and partnerships while delivering the impressive financial results needed to prove its success. Palo Alto Networks presents a compelling case as a market-shaping leader with a clear path for continued growth for investors looking for a core holding in the essential and growing technology sector.

"Microsoft's annual cloud revenue hits $75B, profit beats expectations",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/microsofts-annual-cloud-revenue-hits-75b-profit-beats-expectations-2025-07-30/,"Microsoft said Wednesday that annual revenue for its flagship Azure cloud computing platform has surpassed $75 billion, up 34% from a year earlier. The Azure cloud business is a centerpiece of Microsoft's efforts to shift its focus to artificial intelligence, but until Wednesday the company hadn't disclosed how much money it makes. The revelation came in the software giant's end-of-year earnings report, one that also showed a 24% spike in the company's quarterly profit that beat Wall Street expectations and pleased investors wary about Microsoft's ongoing construction of costly new data centers needed to meet cloud computing and AI demand. “We continue to scale our own data center capacity faster than any other competitor,” CEO Satya Nadella said on an investor call, boasting that the company now has more than 400 of the sprawling facilities across six continents. Microsoft's fiscal fourth-quarter profit was $34.3 billion, or $3.65 per share, beating analyst expectations for $3.37 per share. It posted revenue of $76.4 billion in the April-June period, up 18% from last year. Analysts polled by FactSet Research had been looking for revenue of $73.86 billion. Microsoft launched Azure more than a decade ago, but the service has increasingly become intertwined with its AI ambitions, as the company looks to sell its AI chatbot and other tools to big business customers that are also reliant on its core online services. It still trails behind its lead competitor, Amazon Web Services, which reported $107.6 billion in revenue for its fiscal year that ended in December. Building the infrastructure to power cloud and AI technology is expensive, and Microsoft has looked for savings elsewhere. It announced layoffs of about 15,000 workers this year even as its profits have soared. Nadella told employees last week the layoffs were “weighing heavily” on him but also positioned them as an opportunity to reimagine the company’s mission for an AI era. Still, the overall workforce numbers haven't changed. The company said it employed 228,000 full-time employees as of June 30, the exact same amount it reported a year ago, though slightly more of them are now U.S.-based and fewer of them are in product support roles or consulting services. Promises of a leaner approach have been welcomed on Wall Street, especially as Microsoft and other tech giants are trying to justify huge amounts of capital spending to pay for the data centers, chips and other components required to power AI technology. Google said after releasing its earnings last week it would raise its budget for capital expenditures by an additional $10 billion to $85 billion. Microsoft's chief financial officer, Amy Hood, said she expects capital spending for the July-September quarter to be $30 billion. Microsoft didn't disclose Wednesday to what extent sweeping U.S. tariffs are affecting its revenue, but its annual report lists tariffs among a number of risks the company faces. “Increased geopolitical instabilities and changing U.S. administration priorities create an unpredictable trade landscape,” the company said. It also said the ""volatility of U.S. tariffs has triggered economic uncertainty and could impact cloud and devices supply chain cost competitiveness.""

Meta stock surges after Q2 results blow past expectations despite heavy AI spending,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/meta-stock-surges-after-q2-results-blow-past-expectations-despite-heavy-ai-spending-2025-07-30/,"Meta’s artificial intelligence spending spree appears to be paying off with investors, who sent the company’s stock soaring after hours on Wednesday following a blowout quarterly earnings report. The Menlo Park, California-based company easily beat Wall Street’s expectations for the second quarter, helped by higher advertising revenue and a growing user base on its flagship social media platforms. The money is helping to fund the company's massive investments in AI development and hiring top talent at eye-popping compensation levels. “Not only has Meta made demonstrable strides with AI, but it’s helping to future proof itself as a growth company, should its family of apps get affected by the current anti-trust case or changing social media sentiment,” said Forrester research director Mike Proulx. Meta is facing an antitrust case that's now awaiting a judge's decision and could force the company to break off WhatsApp and Instagram, startups Meta bought more than a decade ago that have since grown into social media powerhouses. The company earned $18.34 billion, or $7.14 per share, in the April-June period. That's up 36% from $13.47 billion, or $5.16 per share, in the same period a year earlier. Revenue jumped 22% to $47.52 billion from $39.07 billion. Analysts expected Meta to earn $5.88 per share on revenue of $44.81 billion, according to a poll by FactSet. Meta's daily active user base on its apps — Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, Instagram and Threads — was 3.48 billion, up 6% year-over-year. Meta said it expects costs to increase as it spends billions on infrastructure and luring highly compensated employees as it works on its AI ambitions. It's forecasting 2025 expenses to be in the range of $114 billion to $118 billion, up 20% to 24% year-over-year. In the latest demonstration of his AI enthusiasm, CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday posted a note detailing his views on “personal superintelligence” that he believes will “help humanity accelerate our pace of progress.” While he said that developing superintelligence is now “in sight,” he did not detail how this will be achieved or exactly what “superintelligence” means. The abstract idea of “superintelligence” is what rival companies call artificial general intelligence, or AGI. It's the latest pivot for a tech leader who in 2021 went all-in on the idea of the metaverse, changing the company’s name and investing billions into advancing virtual reality and related technology. “Meta’s vision is to bring personal superintelligence to everyone. We believe in putting this power in people’s hands to direct it towards what they value in their own lives,” Zuckerberg wrote. “This is distinct from others in the industry who believe superintelligence should be directed centrally towards automating all valuable work, and then humanity will live on a dole of its output.” Zuckerberg said in a conference call he believes AI glasses are going to be “the main way we integrate superintelligence.” Last month, Meta invested $14.3 billion in AI company Scale and recruited its CEO Alexandr Wang to join a team developing “superintelligence.” The tech giant also cut a 20-year deal in early June to secure nuclear power to help meet surging demand for AI and other computing needs. Meta ended the quarter with 75,945 employees, up 7% from a year earlier. Meta's shares rose $81.87, or 11.8% to $777.08 in after-hours trading — on track to reach a record high Thursday after the stock market opens.

Rocketing Volume: 3 Stocks With Big Potential Moves,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/rocketing-volume-3-stocks-with-big-potential-moves/,"It seems that trading the S&P 500 index lately has become an afterthought for most investors on Wall Street, especially considering how little volatility there has been recently to compress the number of opportunities for a profitable run. However, that doesn’t mean money is just going to sit idly by; there are signs of activity elsewhere in the stock market. Some names have been picked up by traders in an unusual reading of trading volume, meaning a potential sign of accumulation or speculation for a short-term move in these chosen names. What this means for investors is that there is still a chance to capture some volatility outside of the indexes in the hopes of turning a profit, as these unusual traders have picked for themselves. A few of the stocks flagged in this unusual volume filter are Rocket Companies Inc. NYSE: RKT, Wendy’s Co. NASDAQ: WEN, and even PulteGroup Inc. NYSE: PHM. When investors consider the reasoning behind these picks, the current cycle in the real estate sector and a budget-friendly restaurant like Wendy’s becomes more understandable, given the current trading levels and the future fundamentals that could appeal to potential buyers. One of the best ways for investors to spot new opportunities is by identifying market outliers, which is mostly achieved by comparing a company's valuation multiples against those of its peer group. When it comes to Rocket Companies stock, the answer is clear as to why the market is valuing it the way it is. Because this stock trades at a price-to-cash (P/C) ratio of up to 71x today, it commands a massive premium to the rest of the finance sector’s 21.6x valuation multiple. Now, the reason why the market is willing to pay this much for the company’s cash needs some fundamental reasoning in order to be truly understood. Now that mortgage data is at the bottom of the cycle, with low volumes and high rates, it isn’t too far-fetched to see that Rocket’s cash in its balance sheet could be deployed aggressively in mortgage generation when mortgage rates inevitably swing lower and spark new demand and activity. This view might have driven traders to ramp up Rocket’s daily volume up to 64.3 million shares on July 22, a significant increase over the average, which is closer to 20 million shares per day. With this in mind, investors now have a fundamental view to bet on for Rocket, and some interested backers behind the stock to drive it higher as well. With consumers growing increasingly worried about inflation and controlling their budgets more rigidly, it makes no sense to bet against a company that caters to these needs and worries, and that is where Wendy’s stock comes into play. Over the past month, investors have seen this sentiment shift through the company’s short interest decline of up to 45.3%. In a clear sign of bearish capitulation, the obvious has been stated for the stock as it now trades at only 49% of its 52-week high, creating a very attractive risk-to-reward ratio in favor of the buyers, as most (if not all) of the downside scenarios in this stock have likely been priced in. Recording up to 19.3 million shares traded on July 22 as well, Wendy’s volume stood head and shoulders above its average of only six million shares, and it is no coincidence that Wall Street analysts have also come to push for higher prices. With a consensus price target of up to $15.3 per share, the Wall Street collective calls for a rally of up to 50.5% in Wendy’s stock for the coming months and quarters. Investors can now connect the dots between sentiment and a broad jump above the average trading volume for this stock. Most investors know that earnings per share (EPS) growth is what drives most of a stock’s performance, and that is where making the connection between Rocket’s upside and PulteGroup’s future growth can make this play easier to understand. If mortgage demand swings, so will homebuilding activity, which might be why Wall Street analysts see PulteGroup reporting up to $3.17 in EPS for the fourth quarter of 2025. Investors must note that PulteGroup reported $3.03 in EPS for the most recent quarter, beating expectations by up to 4% in an unexpected financial recovery. Given this sudden turn, it shouldn’t be a surprise if PulteGroup beats these expectations for the fourth quarter as well. The five million shares traded on July 21 justify a fivefold increase above the daily traded average. With these expectations in place, a new $150 price target by UBS analyst John Lovallo makes a lot more sense now, justifying the implied rally of up to 28% from where the stock trades today.

American Eagle's 'good jeans' ads with Sydney Sweeney spark a debate on race and beauty standards,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/american-eagles-good-jeans-ads-with-sydney-sweeney-spark-a-debate-on-race-and-beauty-standards-2025-07-30/,"NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. fashion retailer American Eagle Outfitters wanted to make a splash with its new advertising campaign starring 27-year-old actor Sydney Sweeney. The ad blitz included “clever, even provocative language” and was “definitely going to push buttons,” the company’s chief marketing officer told trade media outlets. It has. The question now is whether some of the public reactions the fall denim campaign produced is what American Eagle intended. Titled “Sydney Sweeney has great jeans,” the campaign sparked a debate about race, Western beauty standards, and the backlash to “woke” American politics and culture. Most of the negative reception focused on videos that used the word “genes” instead of “jeans” when discussing the blonde-haired, blue-eyed actor known for the HBO series “Euphoria” and “White Lotus.” Some critics saw the wordplay as a nod, either unintentional or deliberate, to eugenics, a discredited theory that held humanity could be improved through selective breeding for certain traits. Marcus Collins, an assistant professor of marketing at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business, said the criticism could have been avoided if the ads showed models of various races making the “genes” pun. “You can either say this was ignorance, or this was laziness, or say that this is intentional,” Collins said. “Either one of the three aren’t good.” Other commenters accused detractors of reading too much into the campaign's message. “I love how the leftist meltdown over the Sydney Sweeney ad has only resulted in a beautiful white blonde girl with blue eyes getting 1000x the exposure for her ‘good genes,’"" former Fox News host Megyn Kelly wrote Tuesday on X. American Eagle didn't respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press. The ad blitz comes as the teen retailer, like many merchants, wrestles with sluggish consumer spending and higher costs from tariffs. American Eagle reported that total sales were down 5% for its February-April quarter compared to a year earlier. A day after Sweeney was announced as the company's latest celebrity collaborator, American Eagle's stock closed more than 4% up. Shares were volatile this week and trading nearly 2% down Wednesday. Like many trendy clothing brands, American Eagle has to differentiate itself from other mid-priced chains with a famous face or by saying something edgy, according to Alan Adamson, co-founder of marketing consultancy Metaforce. Adamson said the Sweeney campaign shares a lineage with Calvin Klein jeans ads from 1980 that featured a 15-year-old Brooke Shields saying, “You want to know what comes in between me and my Calvins? Nothing.” Some TV networks declined to air the spots because of its suggestive double entendre and Shields' age. “It’s the same playbook: a very hot model saying provocative things shot in an interesting way,” Adamson said. Chief Marketing Officer Craig Brommers told industry news website Retail Brew last week that “Sydney is the biggest get in the history of American Eagle,” and the company would promote the partnership in a way that matched. The campaign features videos of Sweeney wearing slouchy jeans in various settings. She will appear on 3-D billboards in Times Square and elsewhere, speaking to users on Snapchat and Instagram, and in an AI-enabled try-on feature. American Eagle also plans to launch a limited edition Sydney jean to raise awareness of domestic violence, with sales proceeds going to a nonprofit crisis counseling service. In a news release, the company noted “Sweeney’s girl next door charm and main character energy – paired with her ability to not take herself too seriously – is the hallmark of this bold, playful campaign.” In one video, Sweeney walks toward an American Eagle billboard of her and the tagline “Sydney Sweeney has great genes.” She crosses out “genes” and replaces it with “jeans.” But what critics found the most troubling was a teaser video in which Sweeney says, “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color. My jeans are blue.” The video appeared on American Eagle’s Facebook page and other social media channels but is not part of the campaign. While remarking that someone has good genes is sometimes used as a compliment, the phrase also has sinister connotations. Eugenics gained popularity in early 20th century America, and Nazi Germany embraced it to carry out Adolf Hitler’s plan for an Aryan master race. Civil rights activists have noted signs of eugenics regaining a foothold through the far right's promotion of the “great replacement theory,” a racist ideology that alleges a conspiracy to diminish the influence of white people. Shalini Shankar, a cultural and linguistic anthropologist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, said she had problems with American Eagle's “genes” versus “jeans” because it exacerbates a limited concept of beauty. “American Eagle, I guess, wants to rebrand itself for a particular kind of white privileged American,” Shankar said. “And that is the kind of aspirational image they want to circulate for people who want to wear their denim.” Many critics compared the American Eagle ad to a misstep by Pepsi in 2017, when it released a TV ad that showed model Kendall Jenner offer a can of soda to a police officer while ostensibly stepping away from a photo shoot to join a crowd of protesters. Viewers mocked the spot for appearing to trivialize protests of police killings of Black people. Pepsi apologized and pulled the ad. The demonstrations that followed the 2020 killing of George Floyd by a white police officer in Minneapolis pushed many U.S. companies to make their advertising better reflect consumers of all races. Some marketers say they've observed another shift since President Donald Trump returned to office and moved to abolish all federal DEI programs and policies. Jazmin Burrell, founder of brand consulting agency Lizzie Della Creative Strategies, said she's noticed while shopping with her cousin more ads and signs that prominently feature white models. “I can see us going back to a world where diversity is not really the standard expectation in advertising,” Burrell said. American Eagle has been praised for diverse marketing in the past, including creating a denim hijab in 2017 and offering its Aerie lingerie brand in a wide range of sizes. A year ago, the company released a limited edition denim collection with tennis star Coco Gauff. The retailer has an ongoing diversity, equity and inclusion program that is primarily geared toward employees. Two days before announcing the Sweeney campaign, American Eagle named the latest recipients of its scholarship award for employees who are driving anti-racism, equality and social justice initiatives. Marketing experts offer mixed opinions on whether the attention surrounding “good jeans” will be good for business. “They were probably thinking that this is going to be their moment,"" Myles Worthington, the founder and CEO of marketing and creative agency WORTHI. ""But this is doing the opposite and deeply distorting their brand."" Melissa Murphy, a marketing professor at Carnegie Mellon University’s Tepper School of Business, said she liked certain parts of the campaign but hoped it would be expanded to showcase people besides Sweeney for the “sake of the brand.” Other experts say the buzz is good even if it's not uniformly positive. “If you try to follow all the rules, you’ll make lots of people happy, but you’ll fail,” Adamson said. “The rocket won’t take off. ” Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

What we know about a new health data tracking system being announced by White House,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/what-we-know-about-a-new-health-data-tracking-system-being-announced-by-white-house-2025-07-30/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has announced a plan for a new private health tracking system that will make it easier for patients to access their health records and monitor their wellness across health care systems and technologies. The system, however, is raising a host of privacy questions. The collaboration between the federal government and Big Tech would allow patients to more seamlessly track and share their medical records or data among doctors, hospital systems and health apps, the administration and participating companies say. Details of the system were announced Wednesday during a White House event dubbed “Making Health Technology Great Again.” The system would be maintained by the federal government through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, pulling health data kept by Big Tech companies like Amazon, Google and Apple as well as major health companies like hospital system Cleveland Clinic and insurer UnitedHealth Group. Patients will need to opt in to have their medical records and data shared, which CMS says will be kept secure. Once a patient is in the system, their information could be shared across apps or health systems that have joined the initiative. So, for example, the Apple Health app on your iPhone that tracks your daily step count or your sleep could access lab results from your doctor's office. Putting that information together, the Trump administration says, will offer a fuller picture of your health. Apps and AI technology could also help people make better choices at the grocery store or identify patterns in their day-to-day life that might be affecting their health, said U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. during Wednesday's White House event. “Now if you have your medical records, you can get personalized advice,"" Kennedy said. Currently, there's no unified database where a person's health data and medical records are kept. Each health system stores, shares and releases patients' records in different ways. That's a big reason a lot of systems still rely on fax machines, because it's a guaranteed way to share records between offices and hospitals. Faxing is also a secure way to send information that complies with federal privacy laws. Some health networks also have their own apps, electronic systems or websites that allow patients to look up their records online or share information with other providers. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services says that 60 companies have signed on to work with the system and that they have pledged to “deliver results to the American people in the first quarter of 2026.” The Trump administration, however, made a similar proposal back in 2018 that never fully came to fruition. Patient advocates and ethicists say many may worry about how their health information — something Americans have long carefully guarded — could be used in ways that they don’t want or expect. “There are enormous ethical and legal concerns,” said Lawrence Gostin, a Georgetown University law professor who specializes in public health. “Patients across America should be very worried that their medical records are going to be used in ways that harm them and their families.” Also, digital privacy advocates say they are skeptical that patients will be able to count on their data being stored securely. “This scheme is an open door for the further use and monetization of sensitive and personal health information,” said Jeffrey Chester at the Center for Digital Democracy.

Bessent says new Trump child savings accounts are 'back door for privatizing Social Security',https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/bessent-says-child-savings-accounts-in-trump-law-are-a-back-door-for-privatizing-social-security-2025-07-30/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Wednesday that the Trump administration was committed to protecting Social Security hours after he said in an interview that a new children's savings program President Donald Trump signed into law “is a back door for privatizing Social Security.” Bessent said Wednesday evening that the accounts created under Trump’s tax break-and-spending cut law “will supplement the sanctity of Social Security’s guaranteed payments.” “This is not an either-or question: our Administration is committed to protecting Social Security and to making sure seniors have more money,” Bessent said in a post on X. Bessent's remarks about privatizing Social Security, which he made at a forum hosted by Breitbart News, were striking after Trump’s repeated promises on the campaign trail and in office that he would not touch Social Security. It also reignited an issue that has dogged Republicans for years. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Democrats quickly seized on the comment as a sign the GOP wants to revive a dormant but unpopular push to privatize the long-running retirement program. “A stunning admission,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said in a Senate speech. “Bessent actually slipped, told the truth: Donald Trump and government want to privatize Social Security.” The idea of privatizing Social Security has been raised by Republicans before, but quickly abandoned. Millions of Americans have come to rely on the certainty of the federal program in which they pay into the system during their working years and then receive guaranteed monthly checks in their older age. Privatization proposals would shift the responsibility for the retirement savings system away from the government and onto Americans themselves. Through personal savings accounts, people would need to manage their own funds, which may or may not be enough to live on as they age. Under the GOP’s “big, beautiful bill,” as the law is called, Republicans launched a new children’s savings program, Trump Accounts, which can be created for babies born in the U.S. and come with a potential $1,000 deposit from the Treasury. Much like an individual retirement account, the Trump Accounts can grow over time, with a post-tax contribution limit of $5,000 a year, and are expected to be treated similarly to the rules for an IRA, and can eventually be tapped for distribution in adulthood. But Bessent on Wednesday allowed for another rationale for the accounts, suggesting they could eventually be the way Americans save for retirement. “In a way, it is a back door for privatizing Social Security,” Bessent said while speaking about the program. The Treasury Department later issued a statement that said, “Trump Accounts are an additive government program that work in conjunction with Social Security to broaden and increase the savings and wealth of Americans. Social Security is a critical safety net for Americans and always will be.” Ever since the George W. Bush administration considered proposals to privatize Social Security more than 20 years ago, Republicans have publicly moved away from talking about the issue that proved politically unpopular and was swiftly abandoned. In the run-up to the 2006 midterms, Democrats capitalized on GOP plans to privatize Social Security, warning it would decimate the program that millions of Americans have come to rely on in older age. They won back control of both the House and the Senate in Congress. The Democrats warned Wednesday that Bessent's comments showed that Republicans want to shift the government-run program to a private one and are again trying to dismantle the retirement program that millions of Americans depend on. “Donald Trump’s Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent just said the quiet part out loud: The administration is scheming to privatize Social Security,” Tim Hogan, a spokesperson for the Democratic National Committee, said in a statement. “It wasn’t enough to kick millions of people off their health care and take food away from hungry kids. Trump is now coming after American seniors with a ‘backdoor’ scam to take away the benefits they earned,” Hogan said. The Social Security program has faced dire financial projections for decades, but changes have long been politically unpopular. Social Security’s trust funds, which cover old age and disability recipients, will be unable to pay full benefits beginning in 2034, according to the most recent report from the program’s trustees. Those officials have said those findings underline the urgency of making changes to programs. Trump, attuned to Social Security's popularity, has repeatedly said he would protect it. Throughout his 2024 presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly said he would “always protect Social Security” and said his Democratic opponents, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, would destroy the program. During the 2024 primary, he accused other Republicans who have expressed support for raising the age for Social Security of being threats to the program. Trump said in an interview with NBC’s “Meet the Press” in December after he won the presidential election that “we’re not touching Social Security, other than we might make it more efficient.” His White House this year said Trump “will always protect Social Security.” Social Security Administration Commissioner Frank Bisignano, a Wall Street veteran, was asked at his confirmation hearing in March about whether Social Security should be privatized. He said he’d “never heard a word of it” and “never thought about it.” ___ Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

Trump signs order to justify 50% tariffs on Brazil,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-signs-order-to-justify-50-tariffs-on-brazil-2025-07-30/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump signed an executive order Wednesday to impose his threatened 50% tariffs on Brazil, setting a legal rationale that Brazil’s policies and criminal prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro constitute an economic emergency under a 1977 law. Trump had threatened the tariffs July 9 in a letter to President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. But the legal basis of that threat was an earlier executive order premised on trade imbalances being a threat to the U.S. economy. But America ran a $6.8 billion trade surplus last year with Brazil, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. A statement by the White House said Brazil’s judiciary had tried to coerce social media companies and block their users, though it did not name the companies involved, X and Rumble. Trump appears to identify with Bolsonaro, who attempted to overturn the results of his 2022 loss to Lula. Similarly, Trump was indicted in 2023 for his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Lula left an event about animal rights early on Wednesday after Trump's move, saying he needed to defend “the sovereignty of the Brazilian people in light of the measures announced by the President of the United States.” The order would apply an additional 40% tariff on the baseline 10% tariff already being levied by Trump. But not all goods imported from Brazil would face the 40% tariff: Civil aircraft and parts, aluminum, tin, wood pulp, energy products and fertilizers are among the products being excluded. The order said the tariffs would go into effect seven days after its signing on Wednesday. Also Wednesday, Trump's Treasury Department announced sanctions on Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes over alleged suppression of freedom of expression and Bolsonaro's ongoing trial. De Moraes oversees the criminal case against Bolsonaro, who is accused of masterminding a plot to stay in power despite his 2022 defeat. On July 18, the State Department announced visa restrictions on Brazilian judicial officials, including de Moraes. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

Why Lyft’s Stock Volume Just Spiked—Is an EV Partnership Near?,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/why-lyfts-stock-volume-just-spiked-is-an-ev-partnership-near/,"Whenever sentiment changes for a stock, investors can typically spot the shift before the big move happens and a window of opportunity quickly closes. A subtle sign can be found in a stock’s trading volume, as any significant increase above the typical or average volume is usually one of the first signs of positioning before a big move comes about. Lyft Inc. NASDAQ: LYFT popped up as one of the stocks recently experiencing unusually high trading volume. Historically, Lyft’s average daily volume has sat near 12 million shares. But in late July 2025, Lyft traded as many as 107.5 million shares in one day, meaning that significant returns may be on the horizon. This could be why some investors have chosen to accumulate stock ahead of these bullish expectations being realized. Those who wait for confirmation will likely be too late. Of course, Lyft doesn’t lead its sector in performance. Uber Technologies Inc. NYSE: UBER, Lyft’s closest rival, currently trades around 88% of its 52-week high, placing it officially in “bull market” territory, with a high probability of reaching a higher ceiling. That advance is fueled in part by Uber’s recent strategic deal with electric vehicle (EV) maker Lucid Group Inc. NASDAQ: LCID, designed to integrate electric and autonomous vehicle capabilities into Uber’s platform. This positions Uber strongly in the emerging self-driving rideshare space. Speculation is growing that Lyft could land a deal with another up-and-coming EV maker or autonomous vehicle developer. If that happens, it would create a multi-year tailwind and expand not only market share but also the company's overall financial profile. While this potential outcome is still speculative, some market analysts have already considered it one of the most likely scenarios for Lyft stock. Institutional interest lends credibility to this thesis. In late July 2025, Allianz Asset Management initiated a $19.4 million position in Lyft, indicating that deep-pocketed institutions with rigorous research capabilities see upside on the stock. And retail investors are paying attention. In addition, the 33 analysts tracked by MarketBeat have assigned LYFT stock a consensus price target of $16.98, a potential upside of 22%. Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Nikhil Devnani is one of the latest to boost his price targets to $18 per share, up from $16 per share, a potential upside of 30% from where it currently trades. These forecasts support the idea that the markets are betting on a potential EV partnership in the future. Given that Lyft stock is trading at only 73% of its 52-week high, it has room to run. Flirting with old highs seems no longer just an idea but a potential outcome. If the high volume is indeed investor positioning ahead of a major partnership or breakthrough, it suggests the opportunity for gains may be front-loaded. Waiting for official announcements or confirmation could mean entering at elevated price levels or missing the move entirely. It is important to remember that while volume can precede news, it doesn’t guarantee it. With Lyft’s next earnings call just around the corner, investors may soon get the clarity they need on strategic developments, including any hints about partnerships or growth initiatives. But for those ready to act, Lyft’s dramatic volume spike may signal a watershed moment if they take action before the window of opportunity closes. Before you consider Lyft, you'll want to hear this.

"Is AI causing tech worker layoffs? That's what CEOs suggest, but the reality is complicated",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/is-ai-causing-tech-worker-layoffs-thats-what-ceos-suggest-but-the-reality-is-complicated-2025-07-30/,"If you read the typical 2025 mass layoff notice from a tech industry CEO, you might think that artificial intelligence cost workers their jobs. The reality is more complicated, with companies trying to signal to Wall Street that they're making themselves more efficient as they prepare for broader changes wrought by AI. A new report Wednesday from career website Indeed says tech job postings in July were down 36% from their early 2020 levels, with AI one but not the most obvious factor in stalling a rebound. ChatGPT’s debut in late 2022 also corresponded with the end of a pandemic-era hiring binge, making it hard to isolate AI's role in the hiring doldrums that followed. “We’re kind of in this period where the tech job market is weak, but other areas of the job market have also cooled at a similar pace,” said Brendon Bernard, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab. “Tech job postings have actually evolved pretty similarly to the rest of the economy, including relative to job postings where there really isn’t that much exposure to AI.” That nuance is not always clear from the last six months of tech layoff emails, which often include a nod to AI in addition to expressions of sympathy. When he announced mass layoffs earlier this year, Workday CEO Carl Eschenbach invited employees to consider the bigger picture: “Companies everywhere are reimagining how work gets done, and the increasing demand for AI has the potential to drive a new era of growth for Workday."" Autodesk CEO Andrew Anagnost explained that a need to shift resources to “accelerate investments” in AI was one of the reasons the company had to cut 1,350, or about 9%, of workers. The “Why We're Doing This” section of CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz's announcement of 5% job cuts said the cybersecurity company needed to double down on AI investments to “accelerate execution and efficiency.” “AI flattens our hiring curve, and helps us innovate from idea to product faster,” Kurtz wrote. It's not just U.S. companies. In India, tech giant Tata Consultancy Services recently characterized its 12,000 layoffs, or 2% of its workforce, as part of a shift to a “Future-Ready organization” that would be realigning its workforce and “deploying AI at scale for our clients and ourselves.” Even the Japanese parent company of Indeed and Glassdoor has cited an AI shift in its notice of 1,300 layoffs at the job search and workplace review sites. Microsoft, which is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter earnings Wednesday, has announced layoffs of about 15,000 workers this year even as its profits have soared. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told employees last week the layoffs were “weighing heavily” on him but also positioned them as an opportunity to reimagine the company's mission for an AI era. Promises of a leaner approach have been welcomed on Wall Street, especially from tech giants that are trying to justify huge amounts of capital spending to pay for the data centers, chips and other components required to power AI technology. “It’s this sort of double-edged sword restructuring that I think a lot of tech giants are encountering in this age of AI, where they have to find the right balance between maintaining an appropriate headcount, but also allowing artificial intelligence to come to the forefront,” said Bryan Hayes, a strategist at Zacks Investment Research. Google said last week it would raise its budget for capital expenditures by an additional $10 billion to $85 billion. Microsoft is expected to outline similar guidance soon. One thing is clear to Hayes: Microsoft's job cuts improve its profit margin outlook for the 2026 fiscal year that started in July. But what these broader tech industry layoffs mean for the employment prospects of tech workers can be harder to gauge. “Will AI replace some of these jobs? Absolutely,” said Hayes. “But it’s also going to create a lot of jobs. Employees that are able to leverage artificial intelligence and help the companies innovate, and create new products and services, are going to be the ones that are in high demand.” He pointed to Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, which is on a spree of offering lucrative packages to recruit elite AI scientists from competitors such as OpenAI. The reports published by Indeed on Wednesday show that AI specialists are faring better than standard software engineers, but even those jobs are not where they have been. “Machine-learning engineers — which is kind of the canonical AI job — those job postings are still noticeably above where they were pre-pandemic, though they’ve actually come down compared to their 2022 peak,” said Bernard, the Indeed economist. “They’ve also been impacted by the cyclical ups and downs of the sector.” Tech hiring has particularly plunged in AI hubs such as the San Francisco Bay Area, as well as Boston and Seattle, according to Indeed. But in looking more closely at which tech workers were least likely to get hired, Indeed found the deepest impact on entry-level jobs in the tech industry, with those with at least five years of experience faring better. The hiring declines were sharpest in entry-level tech industry jobs that involve marketing, administrative assistance and human resources, which all involve tasks that overlap with the strength of the latest generative AI tools that can help create documents and images. “The plunge in tech hiring started before the new AI age, but the shifting experience requirements is something that happened a bit more recently,” Bernard said. Microsoft, which is staking its future on AI in the workplace, has also had its own researchers look into the jobs most vulnerable to the current strengths of AI technology. At the top of the list are knowledge work jobs such as language interpreters or translators, as well as historians, passenger attendants, sales representatives, writers and customer service representatives, according to Microsoft's working paper. On the other end, leading in work more immune to AI changes were phlebotomists, or healthcare workers who draw blood, followed by nursing assistants, workers who remove hazardous materials, painters and embalmers.

Hoffa legend endures 50 years after ex-Detroit union leader's disappearance,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/hoffa-legend-endures-50-years-after-ex-detroit-union-leaders-disappearance-2025-07-30/,"DETROIT (AP) — It was September 2012 and dozens of residents looked on as police cordoned off the area around a shed just northeast of Detroit. Low whispers about what — or who — officers were searching for grew to more excited chatter when the name Jimmy Hoffa started floating around the normally quiet street. By that time, the name had become sort of mythical in and around Detroit. Wednesday marks 50 years since the iron-fisted former Teamsters union boss disappeared from a restaurant about 10 miles (16 kilometers) north of the city. Presumed dead long before being legally declared deceased in 1982, Hoffa's remains were not found beneath the concrete shed floor in Roseville in 2012. Nor were they uncovered eight years earlier, below floorboards in a Detroit house. Neither were they found in 2013 at a horse farm miles northwest of the city. In 2013, digging equipment found mostly dirt as authorities excavated a field in Oakland Township, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) north of Detroit. And no signs of Hoffa were found in 2022 during a search of land beneath the Pulaski Skyway in New Jersey. Hoffa, the son of a coal miner who died when he was 7, was born in Brazil, Indiana, but moved with his mother to Detroit while still a boy. He quit school at 14 and went to work, landing a job on a grocery warehouse loading dock. In 1932, Hoffa led a workers’ strike over poor labor conditions and unfair treatment of workers by the store, according to a post about him on the International Brotherhood of Teamsters website. He joined the union a year later and became a business agent for Local 299 in Detroit, the website said. Hoffa was elected the local's president in 1937 and would become a union organizer. He often found himself on the other end of the law. In 1937, he was convicted of assault and battery. In 1940, he pleaded no contest to charges of conspiring with unionized waste-paper companies to prevent non-union competitors from selling their products. Seven years later, he was arrested for attempted extortion. Each time, Hoffa only received fines. He continued to rise in the union's ranks. From 1957 to 1971, he served as the Teamsters general president. Hoffa had a history of associating with organized crime. In the late 1960s, he was convicted of fraud, conspiracy and jury tampering. He was sent to federal prison in 1967. President Richard Nixon commuted Hoffa's 13-year sentence in 1971. On July 30, 1975, Hoffa, now 62, was to meet reputed Detroit mob enforcer Anthony “Tony Jack” Giacalone and alleged New Jersey mob figure Anthony “Tony Pro” Provenzano at the Machus Red Fox restaurant in Oakland County’s Bloomfield Township. Hoffa called his wife, Josephine, about 2:15 p.m. from a pay phone to tell her no one showed up for the meeting. He has not been seen or heard from since despite scores of tips and multiple searches spanning several states. A grand jury later was convened in Detroit, but no one ever has been directly charged in Hoffa's disappearance or death. The FBI's Detroit office on Wednesday said the Hoffa case “remains one of the most well-known missing person investigations in FBI history.” “Regardless of the age of the case, the FBI Detroit Field Office remains committed to following all credible leads and is seeking information to assist in moving this case forward,” the agency said in a release. “The Hoffa investigation remains active, and our office continues to urge anyone with information to come forward.” Whomever is responsible went to great lengths to keep such information hidden, even after five decades. “I think it confirms in my mind ... somebody did a pretty good hit job on him,” Wayne State University educator Marick Masters said of Hoffa. Masters, professor emeritus at the university's Mike Ilitch School of Business in Detroit, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that Hoffa was considering getting back into Teamsters' leadership at the time of his disappearance. “He still, obviously, was very much passionately involved in the union and he wanted to find a way of moving forward in it,” Masters said. “Whatever the circumstances were, he was tragically prevented from doing that.” Hoffa was inducted into Labor’s International Hall of Fame in 1999, according to the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which refers to Hoffa on its website as “a worker's hero.” “He was viewed as a very passionate champion of the Teamsters,” Masters said. “On the other hand, he had problematic associations which besmirched the image of organized labor. He was a very controversial figure. He was capable of accomplishing things and also capable of having associations that raised questions about his integrity.” Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.
