Asian shares are mixed after Wall Street closes higher and edges to more records,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/asian-shares-are-mixed-after-wall-street-closes-higher-and-edges-to-more-records-2025-07-10/,"MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Asian shares were mixed in cautious trading Friday after Wall Street closed at an all-time high with Delta Air Lines kicking off earnings season with a solid outlook for the rest of 2025, spurring an airline stock rally. Chinese markets were sharply higher. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong added 1.6 % to 24,402.41, while the Shanghai Composite index climbed 1.1% to 3,546.50. Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 edged down 0.1% to 39,662.19, while South Korea's Kospi was up 0.1% to 3,185.15. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 slipped 0.1% to 8,583.40. India's BSE Sensex was flat at 83,190.28. “Just as the market was catching its breath at new highs—drunk on Nvidia fumes and blissfully ignoring the dollar’s quiet groan—President Trump tugged the rug again. A new act in the tariff opera: 35% duties on Canadian imports, with a sweeping upgrade in blanket tariffs now floating between 15% and 20%,"" Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. “Asian equities, initially hopeful, wilted into flat lines as if someone had pulled the plug on the optimism generator. There’s a growing sense now that risk has become radioactive—tradable, but only in hazmat gloves,"" he added. On Thursday, Wall Street added to its recent milestones as the market closed at an all-time high after Delta Air Lines kicked off earnings season with a solid outlook for the second half of the year. The S&P 500 rose 0.3%, inching past the record it set last week after a better-than-expected June jobs report. The Nasdaq composite edged up 0.1%, enough of a gain to notch a new high for the second day in a row. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 0.4% higher. Delta surged 12%, bringing other airlines along with it, after beating Wall Street’s revenue and profit targets. The Atlanta airline also gave a more optimistic view for the remaining summer travel season than it had just a couple months ago. The airline and other major U.S. carriers had pulled or slashed their forecasts in the spring, citing macroeconomic uncertainty amid U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff rollouts, which have consumers feeling uneasy about spending on travel. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) climbed to a new all-time high Thursday, breaking above $113,000. The token’s price jump came amid bullish momentum across risk assets and coincides with Nvidia’s surge to a $4 trillion valuation. It also comes days before the U.S. Congress’ Crypto Week on July 14, where lawmakers will debate a series of bills that could define the regulatory framework for the industry. In other dealings on Friday, benchmark U.S. crude added 44 cents to $67.01 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, advanced 41 cents to $69.05 per barrel. The dollar was trading at 146.95 Japanese yen, up from 146.20 yen. The euro slid to $1,1682 from $1.1704. —- AP Business Writer Alex Veiga contributed to this report.

"To get their own cash, people in Gaza must pay middlemen a 40% cut",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/cash-is-scarce-in-gaza-palestinians-are-paying-a-high-price-to-get-it-2025-07-10/,"DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Cash is the lifeblood of the Gaza Strip’s shattered economy, and like all other necessities in this war-torn territory — food, fuel, medicine — it is in extremely short supply. With nearly every bank branch and ATM inoperable, people have become reliant on an unrestrained network of powerful cash brokers to get money for daily expenses — and commissions on those transactions have soared to about 40%. “The people are crying blood because of this,” said Ayman al-Dahdouh, a school director living in Gaza City. “It’s suffocating us, starving us.” At a time of surging inflation, high unemployment and dwindling savings, the scarcity of cash has magnified the financial squeeze on families — some of whom have begun to sell their possessions to buy essential goods. The cash that is available has even lost some of its luster. Palestinians use the Israeli currency, the shekel, for most transactions. Yet with Israel no longer resupplying the territory with newly printed bank notes, merchants are increasingly reluctant to accept frayed bills. Gaza’s punishing cash crunch has several root causes, experts say. To curtail Hamas’ ability to purchase weapons and pay its fighters, Israel stopped allowing cash to enter Gaza at the start of the war. Around the same time, many wealthy families in Gaza withdrew their money from banks and then fled the territory. And rising fears about Gaza’s financial system prompted foreign businesses selling goods into the territory to demand cash payments. As Gaza’s money supply dwindled and civilians’ desperation mounted, cash brokers' commissions — around 5% at the start of the war — skyrocketed. Someone needing cash transfers money electronically to a broker and moments later is handed a fraction of that amount in bills. Many brokers openly advertise their services, while others are more secretive. Some grocers and retailers have also begun exchanging cash for their customers. “If I need $60, I need to transfer $100,” said Mohammed Basheer al-Farra, who lives in southern Gaza after being displaced from Khan Younis. “This is the only way we can buy essentials, like flour and sugar. We lose nearly half of our money just to be able to spend it.” In 2024, inflation in Gaza surged by 230%, according to the World Bank. It dropped slightly during the ceasefire that began in January, only to shoot up again after Israel backed out of the truce in March. About 80% of people in Gaza were unemployed at the end of 2024, according to the World Bank, and the figure is likely higher now. Those with jobs are mostly paid by direct deposits into their bank accounts. But “when you want to buy vegetables, food, water, medication -- if you want to take transportation, or you need a blanket, or anything — you must use cash,” al-Dahdouh said. Shahid Ajjour’s family has been living off of savings for two years after the pharmacy and another business they owned were ruined by the war. “We had to sell everything just to get cash,” said Ajjour, who sold her gold to buy flour and canned beans. The family of eight spends the equivalent of $12 every two days on flour; before the war, that cost less than $4. Sugar is very expensive, costing the equivalent of $80-$100 per kilogram (2.2 pounds), multiple people said; before the war, that cost less than $2. Gasoline is about $25 a liter, or roughly $95 a gallon, when paying the lower, cash price. The bills in Gaza are tattered after 21 months of war. Money is so fragile, it feels as if it is going to melt in your hands, said Mohammed al-Awini, who lives in a tent camp in southern Gaza. Small business owners said they were under pressure to ask customers for undamaged cash because their suppliers demand pristine bills from them. Thaeir Suhwayl, a flour merchant in Deir al-Balah, said his suppliers recently demanded he pay them only with brand new 200-shekel ($60) bank notes, which he said are rare. Most civilians pay him with 20-shekel ($6) notes that are often in poor condition. On a recent visit to the market, Ajjour transferred the shekel equivalent of around $100 to a cash broker and received around $50 in return. But when she tried to buy some household supplies from a merchant, she was turned away because the bills weren’t in good condition. “So the worth of your $50 is zero in the end,” she said. This problem has given rise to a new business in Gaza: money repair. It costs between 3 and 10 shekels ($1-$3) to mend old bank notes. But even cash repaired with tape or other means is sometimes rejected. After most of the banks closed in the early days of the war, those with large reserves of cash suddenly had immense power. “People are at their mercy,” said Mahmoud Aqel, who has been displaced from his home in southern Gaza. “No one can stop them.” The war makes it impossible to regulate market prices and exchange rates, said Dalia Alazzeh, an expert in finance and accounting at the University of the West of Scotland. “Nobody can physically monitor what’s happening,” Alazzeh said. A year ago, the Palestine Monetary Authority, the equivalent of a central bank for Gaza and the West Bank, sought to ease the crisis by introducing a digital payment system known as Iburaq. It attracted half a million users, or a quarter of the population, according to the World Bank, but was ultimately undermined by merchants insisting on cash. Israel sought to ramp up financial pressure on Hamas earlier this year by tightening the distribution of humanitarian aid, which it said was routinely siphoned off by militants and then resold. Experts said it is unclear if the cash brokers’ activities benefit Hamas, as some Israeli analysts claim. The war has made it more difficult to determine who is behind all sorts of economic activity in the territory, said Omar Shabaan, director of Palthink for Strategic Studies, a Gaza-based think tank. “It's a dark place now. You don't know who is bringing cigarettes into Gaza,"" he said, giving just one example. ""It's like a mafia.” These same deep-pocketed traders are likely the ones running cash brokerages, and selling basic foodstuffs, he said. “They benefit by imposing these commissions,” he said. Once families run out of cash, they are forced to turn to humanitarian aid. Al-Farra said that is what prompted him to begin seeking food at an aid distribution center, where it is common for Palestinians to jostle over one other for sacks of flour and boxes of pasta. “This is the only way I can feed my family,” he said. ___ Kullab reported from Jerusalem.

He closed his store after years of threats. Why Mexico's extortion problem is getting worse,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/he-closed-his-store-after-years-of-threats-why-mexicos-extortion-problem-is-getting-worse-2025-07-10/,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — It started with a phone call to a men’s clothing store in the heart of Mexico City’s historic center. “I need you to put together 10,000 pesos ($500) for me weekly, or else we’ll have to do something,” the voice said. The owner hung up and didn’t answer the phone again for days. But when another call came the following week, in a surge of courage and indignation the owner told the caller he wouldn’t pay, that the money demanded would have been half the store's daily income. “Well, prepare to face the consequences,” the voice said. Several years of escalating threats, visits from goons and armed robberies followed until the shop owner, who requested anonymity because he still fears retaliation, decided to close the store his grandfather had opened in 1936. Extortion is strangling businesses in Mexico. Much, but not all, of it is linked to Mexico powerful organized crime groups. While some larger companies eat it as the cost of doing business, many smaller ones are forced to close. The Mexican Employers’ Association, Coparmex, says extortion cost businesses some $1.3 billion in 2023. And this year, while other major crimes are descending, extortion continues to rise, up 10% nationally in the first quarter compared to the same period last year. In Mexico City, the number of reported extortion cases nearly doubled in the first five months of 2025 to 498, up from 249 for the same period last year. It’s the highest total at this point in the year in the past six years, according to federal crime data. After the first call in 2019, the store owner had his employees stop answering the phone for eight months. Things quieted, but in early 2020, two men came to the shop and demanded payment. The owner pretended to be a shopper and slipped out. In 2021, the weekly calls demanding money in exchange for “security” resumed. Under advice of his attorneys, eventually stopped going into the shop, instead managing everything remotely. In one of several robberies, his employees were held at gunpoint, tied up and locked in a bathroom, while the thieves took money from the cash register. Finally, after two years of threats and robberies, he reported it to authorities. Investigators demanded proof from him that he couldn’t provide because the threats were always verbal, he said. The investigation went nowhere. Reported extortion cases are only a small fraction of the reality. Mexico’s National Institute for Statistics and Geography estimated that some 97% of extortion cases were not reported in 2023. Reporting is low because of a combination of fear and skepticism that authorities will do something. Mexico City police chief Pablo Vásquez Camacho said in an interview with AP that police were receiving more reports of extortion, but recognized that they still weren’t hearing about many more. “We can’t solve something that we’re not even seeing or that isn’t being reported,” Vásquez said. The problem, said Vicente Gutiérrez Camposeco, president of the Mexico City Chamber of Commerce, “has become entrenched” in Mexico and especially the capital in recent years. Daniel Bernardi, whose family has run a popsicle shop in the historic center for 85 years, was resigned to the situation. “There isn't much to do,” he said. ""You pay when you have to pay."" Last month, the Mexico City prosecutor’s office announced that it was creating a special prosecutor’s office to investigate and prosecute extortion. In July, President Claudia Sheinbaum said she would propose legislation giving the government greater powers to pursue extortionists. This week, her administration also announced a national strategy to address extortion. There will be a phone number to anonymously report extortion; the power to immediately cancel phone numbers associated with extortion calls; local anti-extortion units to investigate cases and the involvement of Mexico's Financial Intelligence Unit to freeze bank accounts associated with extortion. Nationally, extortion cases are up more than 6% on the year. Extortion’s rapid expansion has to do with the significant sums it generates for organized crime, drawing in the country’s most powerful drug cartels among others. The Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation cartels have made extortion “one of the divisions of their criminal portfolios,” said security analyst David Saucedo. And with the cartels involved, small-time crooks take advantage of the fear and run their own little extortion rackets, pretending to be associated with larger organized crime groups. The Mexico City men's clothing store owner didn't know who was extorting him. But without help from authorities, he felt alone and exposed. The threats had grown stronger and they now said they’d kill him if he didn’t pay. The owner recalled that a nearby restaurant that had opened around the same time as his own store, had closed after its owner was killed, supposedly after not paying extortion demands. So in December 2023, he saw no other option but to close. Little by little he watched old pieces of furniture carried out of the store that his father had passed on to him as his grandfather had passed it on to his father. “When I closed I felt very sad. And then it made me so mad to think that I could still go on, but because of fear I couldn’t,” he said. “You work your whole life for them to destroy it.” Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

Rubio to meet China's foreign minister in Malaysia as US-Chinese tensions mount,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/rubio-to-meet-chinas-foreign-minister-in-malaysia-as-us-chinese-tensions-mount-2025-07-10/,"KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is wrapping his up his second and final day at a Southeast Asian security conference with a high-stakes meeting with his Chinese counterpart as tensions grow between Washington and Beijing over issues from trade to security and China's support for Russia's war in Ukraine. After discussions with regional countries at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations forum in Malaysia, Rubio on Friday was close out his first official trip to Asia in his first face-to-face talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, the State Department said. The meeting comes less than 24 hours after Rubio met in Kuala Lumpur with another rival, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, during which they discussed potential new avenues to jumpstart Ukraine peace talks. The meetings come against a backdrop of global and regional unease over U.S. policies, notably on trade and large tariffs that U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to impose on friend and foe alike. While Rubio heard complaints about the tariffs from his Southeast Asian counterparts, he told reporters Thursday that many of them focused their discussion on security issues, their concerns about Chinese domination and desire for cooperation with the U.S. “Of course, it’s raised. It’s an issue,” he said. “But I wouldn’t say it solely defines our relationship with many of these countries. There are a lot of other issues that we work together on, and I think there was great enthusiasm that we were here and that we’re a part of this.” However, Trump sees China as the biggest threat to the United States in multiple fields, not least technology and trade, and like previous U.S. presidents has watched the country greatly expand its influence globally while turning increasingly assertive in the Indo-Pacific, notably toward its small neighbors over the South China Sea and Taiwan. Trump has warned of massive tariffs that he could impose on Chinese exports to the United States and preliminary discussions between the two sides have yet to produce significant progress. Since former President Joe Biden was in office, the U.S. has also accused China of assisting Russia in rebuilding its military industrial sector to help it execute its war against Ukraine. Rubio said the Trump administration shares that view. “I think the Chinese clearly have been supportive of the Russian effort, and I think that generally they’ve been willing to help them as much as they can without getting caught,” Rubio said Thursday, suggesting the topic would be discussed if he and Wang met. Rubio and Wang have been shadow boxing during the two-day ASEAN meeting with each touting the benefits of their countries' partnerships with Southeast Asian nations. While Rubio has played up cooperation with the U.S., signing a civil-nuclear cooperation agreement with Malaysia for instance, Wang has railed against Trump's threatened tariffs, notably against almost all of ASEAN's 10 member states, calling them an abuse and an attempt to subvert free and open trade and a danger to global financial stability. While noting an overall “positive” situation in East Asia, in his discussions with Southeast Asian foreign ministers, Wang warned of growing challenges brought by “unilateral protectionism and the arbitrary imposition of tariffs by certain major powers.” On Thursday, Wang and Lavrov met and delivered a subtle but unmistakable warning to the United States over Southeast Asia. “Russia and China both support ASEAN’s central role in regional cooperation, are committed to maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, and are wary of certain major powers creating divisions and instigating confrontation in the region,” they said, according to Russia's foreign ministry.

Albanese will meet with Xi next week on a trip focused on Australia-China business ties,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/albanese-will-meet-with-xi-next-week-on-a-trip-focused-on-australia-china-business-ties-2025-07-10/,"MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese will meet with China’s leader Xi Jinping on an upcoming trip he said Friday would focus on closer business ties. Albanese departs Saturday for the trip that includes stops in Beijing, Shanghai and Chengdu, and meetings with Xi, Premier Li Qiang and Chairman Zhao Leji of the National People’s Congress. Details on those meetings weren't disclosed. Albanese plans to meet business, tourism and sport representatives in Shanghai and Chengdu, his office said. He will lead a business delegation and will attend a CEO roundtable scheduled for Tuesday in Beijing. “Certainly in areas such as green energy for example, there is a real prospect of further engagement,” Albanese told reporters in Sydney. “We cooperate where we can and we disagree where we must and we’re able to have those honest conversations about some of the disagreements that are there,” he added. It will be Albanese’s second visit to China since his center-left Labor Party government was first elected in 2022. It was reelected with an increased majority in May. Albanese has managed to persuade Beijing to remove a series of official and unofficial trade barriers introduced under the previous conservative government that cost Australian exporters more than 20 billion Australian dollars ($13 billion) a year. Beijing severed communications with the previous administration over issues including Australian calls for an independent inquiry into the origins of and responses to COVID-19. But Albanese wants to reduce Australia’s economic dependence on China, a free trade partner. “My government has worked very hard to diversify trade … and to increase our relationships with other countries in the region, including India and Indonesia and the ASEAN countries,” Albanese said, referring to the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations. “But the relationship with China is an important one, as is our relationships when it comes to exports with the north Asian economies of South Korea and Japan,” he added.

Trump plans to hike tariffs on Canadian goods to 35%,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-plans-to-hike-tariffs-on-canadian-goods-to-35-2025-07-10/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said in a Thursday letter that he will raise taxes on many imported goods from Canada to 35%, deepening a rift between two North American countries that have suffered a debilitating blow to their decades-old alliance. The letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is an aggressive increase to the top 25% tariff rates that Trump first imposed in March after months of threats. Trump's tariffs were allegedly in an effort to get Canada to crack down on fentanyl smuggling despite the relatively modest trafficking in the drug from that country. Trump has also expressed frustration with a trade deficit with Canada that largely reflects oil purchases by America. “I must mention that the flow of Fentanyl is hardly the only challenge we have with Canada, which has many Tariff, and Non-Tariff, Policies and Trade Barriers,” Trump wrote in the letter. The higher rates would go into effect Aug. 1, creating a tense series of weeks ahead for the global economy as recent gains in the S&P 500 stock index suggest many investors think Trump will ultimately back down on the increases. While multiple countries have received tariff letters this week, Canada — America's second largest trading partner after Mexico — has become something of a foil to Trump. It has imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods and pushed back on the president's taunts of making Canada the 51st state. Mexico has also faced 25% tariffs because of fentanyl, yet it has not faced the same public pressure from Trump. Carney was elected prime minister in April on the argument that Canadians should keep their “elbows up.” He has responded by distancing Canada from its intertwined relationship with the U.S., seeking to strengthen its links with the European Union and the United Kingdom. Hours before Trump's letter, Carney posted on X a picture of himself with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, saying, “In the face of global trade challenges, the world is turning to reliable economic partners like Canada.” Implied in his statement was that the U.S. has become unreliable because of Trump's haphazard tariff regime, which has gone through aggressive threats and reversals. When Carney went to the White House in May, the public portion of their meeting was cordial. But Trump said there was nothing the Canadian leader could tell him to remove the tariffs. “Just the way it is,” Trump said at the time. Carney indicated he would be willing to be patient in pursuing talks on trade. “There are much bigger forces involved,” the Canadian leader said. “And this will take some time and some discussions.” Trump has sent a series of tariff letters to 23 countries so far. Those form letters became increasingly personal with Canada as well as a Wednesday note that put a 50% tariff on Brazil for the ongoing trial of its former president, Jair Bolsonaro, for trying to stay in office after his 2022 election loss. Trump was similarly indicted for his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss. The letters reflect the inability of Trump to finalize the dozens of trade frameworks that he claimed would be easy to negotiate. Shortly after unveiling his April 2 “Liberation Day” tariffs, a financial market selloff caused Trump to announce a 90-day negotiating period during which a 10% baseline tariff would be charged on most imported goods. But Trump has indicated that the 10% tariff rates are largely disappearing as he resets the rates with his letters. “We’re just going to say all of the remaining countries are going to pay, whether it’s 20% or 15%,” Trump said in a phone interview with NBC News. So far, Trump has announced trade frameworks with the U.K. and Vietnam, as well as a separate deal with China in order to enable continued trade talks. Trump jacked up import taxes on Chinese goods to as much as 145%, but after talks Trump has said China faces total tariffs of 55%. In June, Trump said he was suspending trade talks with Canada over its plans to continue its digital services tax, which would hit U.S. technology companies. A few days later, talks resumed when Carney rescinded the tax. Under the current tariff structure, the 2020 United States Mexico Canada Agreement has protected eligible goods from Trump's tariffs. But a review of the pact is scheduled for 2026. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

Protesters and federal agents clash during raid at Southern California farm,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/protesters-and-federal-agents-clash-during-raid-at-southern-california-farm-2025-07-10/,"A confrontation erupted Thursday between protesters and federal officials carrying out a raid on a Southern California farm, with authorities throwing canisters that sprayed what looked like smoke into the air to disperse the crowd. Vehicles from Border Patrol and U.S. Customs and Border Protection blocked the road in a largely agricultural area of Camarillo lined with fields and greenhouses. There were military-style vehicles and a helicopter flying overhead. Television images showed dozens of demonstrators gathered on a road between fields where uniformed officers stood in a line across from them. In other images, white and green smoke can be seen as protesters retreat. Other images showed protesters shouting at agents wearing camouflage gear, helmets and gas masks. It wasn’t clear why the authorities threw the canisters or if they released chemicals like tear gas. Another image from KTLA showed people sat against a wall with their hands bound in front of them; it wasn't clear if they were workers or protesters. A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said they were executing a warrant at a marijuana facility. Glass House Farms said on social media that it was visited Thursday by officials for Immigration and Customs Enforcement and “fully complied with agent search warrants.” It's legal to grow and sell cannabis in California with proper licensing. State records show the company has multiple active licenses to cultivate cannabis. The company also has a permit to grow in Ventura County, and as of last year used half of the space for cannabis while half was dedicated to tomatoes and cucumbers, the Ventura County Star reported. Judith Ramos said she received a call Thursday morning from her father, who worked in the tomato fields. “He said immigration was outside his job, and if anything happened to take care of everything,” Ramos said, her voice cracking. The 22-year-old certified nurse assistant said she has two young siblings. Ramos went to the farm and saw a busload of people being taken out. She was protesting alongside others when agents sprayed the deterrent. “They didn't want us to get any closer, and they started firing,” Ramos said. “I got some in my eyes. I had to put milk on my face.” Ramos said she does not know where her father is and had not had contact with him for more than an hour. His truck is still at the worksite, she said. It was not immediately known which agencies participated in the raid. The incident comes as federal immigration enforcement agents have ramped up arrests in Southern California, heading to car washes, farms and Home Depot parking lots to take people into custody while stoking widespread fear among immigrant communities. The Trump administration has had the National Guard providing protection to federal immigration agents carrying out the raids, and this week it sent a large caravan with guns and horses to a park in Los Angeles. Andrew Dowd, spokesperson for the Ventura County Fire Department, said they were dispatched around 12:15 p.m. Thursday to the area to provide emergency medical aid. Crews took three people to nearby hospitals, he said, and the incident is ongoing. Dowd said he had no information on the types of injuries or medical emergencies sustained, and he did not have any details of the people sent to hospitals. He said he had no information on what law enforcement was doing there. ___ Associated Press writer Janie Har in San Francisco and freelancer Michael Owen Baker in Camarillo, California, contributed.

Global Citizen takes its fight against poverty to the world's growing cities,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/global-citizen-takes-its-fight-against-poverty-to-the-worlds-growing-cities-2025-07-10/,"DETROIT (AP) — Global Citizen is turning to cities as it looks to break through what it sees as widespread political gridlock hindering large-scale action on its goal of ending extreme poverty worldwide. The nonprofit advocacy group has rallied the private sector and foreign dignitaries to solve humanitarian challenges together, driving millions of dollars toward replenishing international aid and eradicating polio since 2008. But Global Citizen co-founder Simon Moss said Thursday it is local officials who are increasingly joining traditional international players in shaping whether communities are equipped to tackle urgent crises. “We can get beyond partisan politics a lot of the time when you’re dealing with a group of people in a city who all literally live there,"" Moss said. “That’s easier a lot of the time to get real progress compared to waiting on elected officials in capitals, who will often talk a good game and who’ll be responsive, but where, in America and many other countries, they’re finding it really hard to actually make big-picture policy decisions,"" he added. The emphasis arose when leaders heard shared concerns from partners across major African and North American cities. In Detroit, which Thursday hosted Global Citizen’s first American conference outside New York City, organizers saw an opportunity to highlight a place experiencing population growth after decades-long losses alongside the auto industry’s decline. The urban focus also reflects U.N. projections that more than two-thirds of the world's population will live in cities by 2050 — a trend that Global Citizen fears will worsen concentrated poverty if local governments don't start creating inclusive economic opportunities. To prevent under-resourced communities from missing the latest technological changes, Global Citizen unveiled a new partnership making artificial intelligence more accessible. Goodera, a company that helps implement corporate volunteer programs, aims to mobilize engineers with the goal of making 10 million people “AI literate” by 2030. Half of those people will be underserved women and youth, according to Moss. Their first focus will be bridging the digital divide in cities, according to Moss, and Goodera is helping identify those most at risk of getting left behind. They also plan to work with entrepreneurs in low-income countries. Billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban noted the transformative potential for small business owners during a panel Thursday at Global Citizen NOW: Detroit. ChatGPT can “write a business plan that's better” than anything he could write, Cuban admitted, and offers access to every piece of business advice out there. George Opare Addo, Ghana's minister of youth development and empowerment, pointed out that farmers are already using the technology's limited availability to better predict weather and improve their yields. But he said that youth must be engaged in its rollout. “For young people to be able to appreciate AI, then they must be not just users of it, but makers of it,” he said. Other panelists emphasized the need for cities to build shared cultures by fostering creative scenes and sports fandoms. Global Citizen has recently relied on high-powered sports leagues such as FIFA to raise money for education initiatives. And Cuban — who previously owned the Dallas Mavericks — said no industry unites people around a common cause like sports. “As things change in a city, the first place you look is the sports team for support, always. Every tragedy, you look to the sports team first, always,” Cuban said. “And that is so unique. You just don’t get that with any other business.” For celebrity chef Marcus Samuelsson, the food industry provides “spaces that you can have dialogues” and “opportunities to break bread.” Samuelsson's cuisine, for example, blends his Ethiopian heritage with his Swedish upbringing. Jessica Nabongo, a Ugandan-American travel blogger, recalled growing up eating Lebanese, Polish and Japanese foods in Detroit’s diverse culinary scene. That experience, she said, instilled “a respect for other people’s culture out the gate.” “There has to be a reverence — truly a reverence — for the people who are here and have been here and made the city what it is, no matter what the ebbs and flows are,” she said. As cities change, though, it is local artists who Detroit Poet Laureate jessica Care moore finds are tasked with making sure their histories remain told and their longtime residents remain seen. Good artists, she said, “paint the pictures that people can’t see” and “ask the questions that nobody’s asking.” “Artists are the pulse of the people,” she said. “If you turn cities into just places for corporations, then you lose the soul of the city. And Detroit, the soul of our city, are the people that live here.” ___ Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Trump administration opens investigation into Minnesota agency's affirmative action policy,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-administration-opens-investigation-into-minnesota-agencys-affirmative-action-policy-2025-07-10/,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The Trump administration said Thursday that it has opened an investigation into whether a Minnesota state agency's newly updated affirmative action policy violates civil rights laws. The Minnesota Department of Human Services' policy requires supervisors to provide a “hiring justification when seeking to hire a non-underrepresented candidate.” Supervisors who don't comply can be disciplined, even fired. The Department of Justice said in a statement that the policy “seems to be part of a broader effort by the state to engage in race- and sex-based employment practices in its ‘affirmative action’ objectives.” The Trump administration has been using federal civil rights law to fight diversity, equity and inclusion programs on several fronts, saying diversity preferences amount to illegal discrimination against white and Asian American people. On Thursday, the administration opened a civil rights investigation into hiring practices at George Mason University, Virginia’s largest public university. ""Minnesotans deserve to have their state government employees hired based on merit, not based on illegal DEI,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement. The policy, as first reported this week by Alpha News, a local conservative website, requires supervisors to justify their decision when hiring a candidate who doesn't come from an “underrepresented” group — women and racial minorities — for job categories where those groups are considered underrepresented. The state Department of Human Services said in a statement that it “follows all state and federal hiring laws.” It said justification for “non-affirmative action hires for some vacancies has been required by state law since 1987."" And it cited a state statute that says, “An agency that does not meet its hiring goals must justify its nonaffirmative action hires in competitive appointments and noncompetitive appointments.” In a letter Thursday to Shireen Gandhi, the state agency’s temporary commissioner, and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, the head of Justice Department's Civil Rights Division said it has reason to believe the policy is unlawful. “This hiring justification policy appears to be just one component of a broader effort by Minnesota to engage in race- and sex-based employment practices pursuant to ‘affirmative action’ objectives,” Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon wrote. Minnesota Republicans were quick to call for elimination of the policy. “This hiring policy is DEI on steroids,” Senate Minority Leader Mark Johnson, of East Grand Forks, said in a statement. In another Trump administration move against DEI programs on Thursday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture published a final rule lifting requirements for racial and gender preferences in its programs. The Justice Department has targeted other racial justice initiatives in Minnesota. In May, it backed out of a settlement with Minneapolis that called for an overhaul of its police department following the murder of George Floyd in 2020. Also in May, it opened an investigation of the prosecutor’s office in Minnesota’s most populous county after its leader directed her staff to consider racial disparities as one factor when negotiating plea deals.

(AP) — A McDonald's employee returned to her Detroit-area restaurant after an argument Thursday and fatally stabbed a co-worker multiple times, police said. A breakfast customer licensed to carry a gun fired a warning shot and stopped the 26-year-old woman as she tried to flee, Eastpointe police Lt. Alex Holish said. “For a verbal dispute to turn into this is ridiculous,” Holish told the Macomb Daily. “People have to learn how to resolve their disputes.""

Missouri governor repeals paid sick leave law approved last year by voters,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/missouri-governor-repeals-paid-sick-leave-law-approved-last-year-by-voters-2025-07-10/,"JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) — Eight months after voters approved it, Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe signed the repeal of a law Thursday that had guaranteed paid sick leave to workers and inflationary adjustments to the minimum wage. The move marked a major victory for the state's largest business group and a frustrating defeat for workers' rights advocates, who had spent years — and millions of dollars — building support for the successful ballot measure. The repeal will take effect Aug. 28. Kehoe, who also signed a package of tax breaks Thursday, described the paid sick leave law as an onerous mandate that imposed burdensome record-keeping. ""Today, we are protecting the people who make Missouri work — families, job creators, and small business owners — by cutting taxes, rolling back overreach, and eliminating costly mandates,” Kehoe, a Republican, said in a statement released after a private bill-signing ceremony. The new tax law excludes capital gains from individual state income taxes, expands tax breaks for seniors and disabled residents and exempts diapers and feminine hygiene products from sales taxes. Richard von Glahn, who sponsored the worker benefit ballot initiative, said many parents felt forced to go to work, instead of staying home to care for a sick child, in order to pay for their rent or utilities. ""The governor signing this bill is an absolute betrayal to those families, and it hurts my heart,” said von Glahn, policy director for Missouri Jobs With Justice. About one-third of states mandate paid sick leave, but many businesses voluntarily provide it. Nationwide, 79% of private-sector employees received paid sick leave last year, though part-time workers were significantly less likely to receive the benefit than full-time employees, according to Department of Labor data. Voters in Alaska, Missouri and Nebraska all approved paid sick leave measures last November. Only Alaska’s, which kicked in on July 1, has remained unchanged by state lawmakers. Before Nebraska's measure could take effect Oct. 1, Republican Gov. Jim Pillen signed a measure last month exempting businesses with 10 or fewer employees from the paid sick leave requirements. The revision also lets businesses withhold paid sick leave from seasonal agricultural workers and 14- and 15-year-olds. Missouri's law allowed employees to earn one hour of paid sick time for every 30 hours worked, starting May 1. By the time it's repealed, 17 weeks will have elapsed. That means someone working 40 hours a week could have earned 22 hours of paid sick leave. If workers don't use their paid sick leave before Aug. 28, there's no legal guarantee they can do so afterward. The Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry had made repealing the law its top legislative priority. The ""paid leave and minimum wage policies were a job killer,” chamber President and CEO Kara Corches said. But Missouri voters could get a second chance at mandating paid sick leave. Von Glahn has submitted a proposed ballot initiative to the secretary of state that would reinstate the repealed provisions. Because the new measure is a constitutional amendment, the Legislature would be unable to revise or repeal it without another vote of the people. Supporters haven't decided whether to launch a petition drive to try to qualify the measure for the 2026 ballot. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

Brazil vows retaliatory tariffs against US if Trump follows through on 50% import taxes,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/brazil-vows-retaliatory-tariffs-against-us-if-trump-follows-through-on-50-import-taxes-2025-07-10/,"RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said Thursday that he will impose retaliatory tariffs on the United States if President Donald Trump follows through on a pledge to boost import taxes by 50% over the South American country's criminal trial against his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro. Lula said he will trigger Brazil's reciprocity law approved by Congress earlier this year if negotiations with the U.S. fail. “If there’s no negotiation, the reciprocity law will be put to work. If he charges 50 (% tariffs) from us, we will charge 50 from them,” Lula told TV Record in excerpts of an interview that will be fully aired later in the day. “Respect is good. I like to offer mine and I like to receive it.” Lula's comments raise the risk of a tariffs war erupting between the two countries, similar to what has happened between the U.S. and China. Trump has vowed to respond forcefully if countries seek to punish the U.S. by adding tariffs of their own. The president of Brazil's Senate, Sen. Davi Alcolumbre, and Chamber of Deputies Speaker Hugo Motta, a pair of moderates who have recently been at odds with Lula, agreed that the recipricity law gives Brazil “the means ... to protect our sovereignty.” “We will be ready to act with balance and firmness in defense of our economy, our productive sector, and the protection of Brazilian jobs,” they said in a joint statement. The tariffs letter that Trump sent to Brazil — and posted on social media Wednesday — railing against the “witch hunt” trial against Bolsonaro opened up a new front in his trade wars, with the U.S. leader directly using import taxes to interfere with another nation’s domestic politics. Trump has already tried to use tariffs to ostensibly combat fentanyl trafficking and as a negotiating tool to change how other nations tax digital services and regulate their economies. In Brazil’s case, Trump is trying to dictate the outcome of the criminal trial of Bolsonaro, an ally who like Trump has been charged with attempting to overturn a presidential election. Bolsonaro maintains that he is being politically persecuted by Brazil’s Supreme Court over his charges on the alleged plot to remain in power after his 2022 election loss to Lula. “There’s nothing Lula or Brazil can do about Bolsonaro’s trial,” said Carlos Melo, a political science professor at Insper University in Sao Paulo. “Any change in that would be Brazil's capitulation. Bolsonaro’s situation here won’t change. How do you negotiate over that?"" Lula ordered his diplomats on Thursday to return Trump's letter if it physically arrives at the presidential palace in Brasilia. The document attacks the country's judiciary and mentions recent rulings on social media companies among the reasons why goods from the South American nation will have higher tariffs from Aug. 1. Trump has initiated his tariffs under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, saying in April that the persistent deficit between what the U.S. exports and what it imports is a national crisis. But the U.S. runs a trade surplus with Brazil, undermining some of the rationale. A staffer of Brazil's foreign ministry told The Associated Press that trade negotiations that were ongoing since Trump imposed a first set of tariffs in April are now “up in the air.” Some members of the Lula administration say Trump’s move is actually aimed at Brazil’s connection with other Southern economies, as displayed on Sunday at the summit of BRICS nations hosted in Rio de Janeiro. Brazil's president once again mentioned the hope for an alternative currency to the dollar for transactions, a topic that frequently draws Trump's ire. “Trump was never worried about democracy anywhere, much less with Bolsonaro’s destiny,” said Gleisi Hoffmann, Brazil’s institutional relations minister. Trump's interference in Brazilian affairs has brought a sense of unity that was largely absent in the politically divided nation. Some of Bolsonaro's allies claimed Lula had drawn the U.S. president's anger with other decisions, including criticism of Israel's war in Gaza. But other supporters of the former president chose to ask for prudence in negotiations. Daily O Estado de S. Paulo, a frequent critic of Lula and his administration, said in an editorial on Thursday that Trump’s move against the Brazilian government is “a mafia thing.” It also said Lula's reaction was correct, a rare feature for the newspaper. Analysts also see Trump’s attempt to interfere in the country's domestic affairs as a potential backfire for Bolsonaro during his trial and a push for Lula, whose reelection bid was facing unpopularity headwinds this year. Canadians recently elected Mark Carney as prime minister, with his Liberal Party reenergized by Trump’s tariffs and threats to make Canada the 51st U.S. state. “The reaction of a lot of people is that this is a political gift to Lula,” said Andre Pagliarini, a professor of history and international studies at Louisiana State University who is also affiliated with the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft. Thomas Traumann, an independent political consultant and former Brazilian minister, called Trump's move “a game changer"" for next year's election. “Trump put Lula back in the game,” Traumann said. “This gives Lula a narrative, puts Bolsonaro as the guilty part for any economic problems.” The U.S. Court of International Trade ruled in May that Trump had exceeded his authority by declaring an emergency to impose tariffs without congressional approval. The Trump administration is appealing that decision, but opponents plan to use his Brazil letter to bolster their case. “This is a brazenly illegal effort by Donald Trump to sacrifice the economy to settle his own personal scores, and it is far outside his legal authority,” said Democratic Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden. The Republican administration has argued that their tariffs are now relatively harmless for the U.S. economy, since inflation has trended down in recent months. But many companies stockpiled imports to get ahead of the import taxes, and it’s unclear what happens when their inventories dwindle and consumers consider the risk of higher prices. Most outside economic analyses expect growth to decline. In Brazil, Trump’s interest in Bolsonaro’s trial is expected to weigh over the trial. Media outlets have reported that lawmakers and judges are worried the former president will try to leave Brazil for the U.S. if he is convicted. Lawmaker Eduardo Bolsonaro, a son of the former president, moved to the U.S. in March. On Wednesday night, he asked his supporters on X to post “their thank you to President Donald Trump."" In Thursday's interview, Lula said the elder Bolsonaro “should take the responsibility for agreeing with Trump’s taxation to Brazil.” “His son went there to make up Trump’s mind, then he (Trump) writes a letter to speak about a case that is in the hands of the Supreme Court. A case that is not a political trial. What is under investigation is the evidence of the case,” Lula said. ___ Boak reported from Washington.

BigBear.ai: Why a 90% Rally Could Be Just the Start,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/bigbearai-why-a-90-rally-could-be-just-the-start/,"While Wall Street and the news media often focus on the titans of artificial intelligence (AI), a powerful, yet underreported, story is unfolding in the small-cap market space. BigBear.ai Holdings, Inc. NYSE: BBAI, a provider of AI solutions, has been on a remarkable run. Its stock has climbed nearly 90% in the last 30 days, a move that demands attention from investors looking for the next wave of AI winners. BigBear.ai’s (BBAI) explosive growth signals a potential market awakening to a company that is consistently delivering on strategic goals. The sharp upward move in BBAI's stock suggests a shift in focus, where investors are now prioritizing a compelling series of operational wins over the company's past challenges. BigBear.ai’s recent stock price climb is driven by tangible business successes that showcase its strategic expansion and technological strength. A key catalyst is the company's strategic push into international markets. BigBear.ai recently announced an exclusive partnership with Easy Lease PJSC and Vigilix Technology to bring its AI solutions to the United Arab Emirates. This deal addresses high-growth needs, such as logistics and predictive fleet maintenance, establishing a vital foothold in the Middle East. At the same time, the company is demonstrating its ability to apply its powerful technology to the commercial world. A new collaboration with Analogic will integrate BigBear.ai's ""Pro-Detect"" vision AI into airport CT scanners. This technology helps improve threat detection, creating a significant new business opportunity in aviation security. While expanding its commercial reach, BigBear.ai has also strengthened its core defense business. The company successfully demonstrated its advanced forecasting technology at the U.S. Army's prestigious Project Convergence experiment. This success reaffirms its strong relationships with government clients and validates its high-tech credentials. These wins are happening as governments worldwide increase their spending on AI capabilities. This favorable market trend provides a strong tailwind for BigBear.ai's continued growth. A closer look at the market data reveals signals that support a continued positive outlook for BigBear.ai. The recent analyst action from H.C. Wainwright is a telling indicator. On July 1, the firm maintained its Buy rating and raised its price target from $6.00 to $9.00. This suggests that Wall Street is beginning to recognize the company’s strong execution and is revising its valuation models upward. BigBear.ai also has a very high short interest, with nearly 28% of its public shares being bet against by short-selling investors. Usually, a sign of negative sentiment, this can become a powerful positive catalyst for a stock backed by good news. If the stock continues to rise, these short-sellers may be forced to buy back shares to limit their losses. This rush of buying, known as a short squeeze, can act like rocket fuel for the stock price. No investment story is without its challenges. In March 2025, BigBear.ai disclosed the need for a financial restatement and identified a material weakness in its internal controls. These past events created the initial buying opportunity for investors who could see the company's long-term potential. Today, the market appears to be forward-looking. The powerful rally since those announcements suggests investor focus has shifted squarely to the company's future. The ongoing efforts to strengthen financial governance are now seen as a necessary and positive step for a maturing public company. With procedural deadlines in related lawsuits having passed in June, the market seems confident in the company's ability to navigate these historical hurdles. The narrative is no longer defined by past issues but by the strong operational engine driving the company forward. BigBear.ai's powerful rally is built on a solid foundation of tangible achievements. The company is successfully executing its growth strategy through international expansion, commercial innovation, and continued excellence in the defense sector. By consistently delivering on its promises, BigBear.ai is demonstrating its ability to move beyond the shadow of past challenges. For investors looking to identify the next wave of high-growth AI stocks, the company presents a compelling story of an agile player hitting its stride. Backed by real-world contracts and a clear vision, BigBear.ai's growth journey appears to be just getting started. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

5 Hot Stocks With Summer Buybacks You Can Cash In On,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/5-hot-stocks-with-summer-buybacks-you-can-cash-in-on/,"Stock buybacks remain one of the most effective tools for boosting share prices, especially when backed by solid fundamentals. When a company is healthy, repurchasing shares reduces the float, enhances earnings per share, and signals confidence to the market. Several companies announced major repurchase plans in June and early July, combining strong balance sheets with strategic capital return. Each has the financial muscle and operational momentum to follow through, driving shareholder value in the process. Collegium Pharmaceuticals NASDAQ: COLL is a small pharmaceutical firm focused on pain management. Critical highlights in 2025 include the company’s growing revenue, positive pipeline developments, improving profitability, and profits. The profits are critical as they allow this company to return capital to shareholders, and the return has been robust. The share count fell by 20% on average year-over-year (YOY) in Q1 and can be expected to continue falling at an aggressive pace. The latest news is a new $150 million share repurchase authorization to replace the existing. Collegium’s balance sheet offers no red flags for investors. Details at the end of Q1 reflect an increased cash position, reduced intangibles, and flat assets, all of which are compounded by a reduction in total liabilities. The net result is increased equity despite the massive share count reduction and improved leverage. The long-term debt-to-equity ratio is roughly 3x, leaving the company in a healthy financial position.  Enovix NASDAQ: ENVX affirmed its robust outlook by initiating a buyback plan in early July. The plan, worth $60 million over the next two years, is significant because it exceeds the company’s 2025 revenue outlook. The critical takeaway is that its rapidly improving manufacturing capability, new products, and end-market demand point to sustainable hypergrowth and the ability to follow through with the buying. The consensus forecast for 2026 predicts revenue growth of more than 300%, which may be conservative due to the mounting traction. Enovix's Balance sheet affirms its ability to buy back shares as indicated. The highlights from Q1 include reduced cash but a solid $248 million, roughly equal to its total liability. Leverage is low, and cash flow is improving, leaving it in a healthy position capable of returning $60 million comfortably over the next 18 months. That’s worth approximately 2.3% of the market cap as of early July.  After a long period during which it was not allowed to buy shares, Thor Industries NYSE: THO is hammering down on buybacks again. The news from June is that the board re-authorized its $400 million allowance, and buybacks have been reducing the count since the start of the fiscal third quarter. At $400 million, the authorization is worth more than 8% of the early July market cap and will significantly boost shareholder value once completed. Critical details for Thor Industries investors are that this RV leader emerged from post-pandemic industry normalization in Q3, resuming growth and widening margins. The margin is a significant factor, providing sufficient cash flow and income to sustain balance sheet health, buyback shares, pay dividends, and increase the distribution annually. The yield is attractive at roughly 2.2%.  Darden Restaurants' NYSE: DRI FQ4 2025 report provided investors with just what they wanted: growth, solid margins, improved guidance, and a healthy increase in capital return. The increase included a dividend increase and a new, $1 billion share repurchase authorization. The repurchase is worth 3.8% of the shares as of the time of the release and is expected to be completed over the coming quarters. Darden’s ability to buy back the shares is supported by its healthy balance sheet, growth outlook, and decision to sell Bahama Breeze. Bahama Breeze is an underperforming business that management sees benefiting from new owners. A sale would allow them to focus on their core business and provide a substantial cash injection.  The board of Fifth Third Bancorp NASDAQ: FITB reauthorized the company’s buyback plan. The existing authorization had only 11.8 shares remaining; the new one is worth 100 million and comes with no expiration. The company’s buybacks reduce the count quarterly and are compounded by a robust dividend. The yield is worth an annualized 3.45% and can be expected to grow at a mid-single-digit pace annually. Analyst trends are supporting this financial stock in July. The group of 19 tracked by MarketBeat reveals firming sentiment, a solid Moderate Buy rating, and upward pressure in the price target. The consensus forecasts a 10% upside, aligning this market with 2024’s highs, and the revision trend is leading to higher levels. Before you consider Fifth Third Bancorp, you'll want to hear this.

Why Now Could Be the Smartest Time to Buy Crypto Stocks,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/why-now-could-be-the-smartest-time-to-buy-crypto-stocks/,"With the U.S. dollar down a whopping 10.7% against peer currencies for the first half of 2023—the worst performance in more than 50 years—investors are seeking out alternative investments for either security or growth potential. Cryptocurrencies are not known for their stability, but many investors do see potential in their volatility. What's more, some (including BlackRock CEO Larry Fink) actually see the possibility of Bitcoin overtaking the U.S. dollar as the world's reserve currency. Finally, investors may watch out for secondary benefits to cryptocurrencies as the One Big Beautiful Bill raises the debt ceiling by several trillion dollars. While a direct investment in crypto is likely the most common way of gaining exposure to the space, investors seeking diversification or looking to avoid the risks of transacting with and storing tokens might also consider any number of cryptocurrency-adjacent stocks. These include companies that mine crypto, that provide infrastructure or hardware used in the industry, and so on. Interestingly, while there are reasons to buy crypto stocks related to the potential of the cryptocurrency space, one of the most successful of these firms has pivoted toward energy sales in a compelling way as well. Marathon Digital NASDAQ: MARA is one of the largest crypto mining firms in the United States, with a market value of more than $6 billion. This has allowed it to build up a massive mining fleet, with impressive results: in June, the firm won 211 Bitcoin blocks through the complex mining process, or more than 5% of all available Bitcoin rewards that month. Shares of the stock spiked on the news and are up about 6% in the last month. The firm appears poised to achieve its ambitious production upscaling goals. MARA executives have set a production target by year-end of 75 exahashes per second (a measure of computational power key to successfully mining Bitcoin). This is a full 40% higher than the hash rate achieved at the end of 2024. MARA's substantial mining power has translated into significant BTC holdings as well, as the company had nearly 48,000 BTC as of the end of June. At a value of roughly $5.2 billion, this makes up the lion's share of MARA's market value—investors should keep in mind that a crash in crypto prices could very well decimate the firm. Nonetheless, five out of 10 analysts rate MARA stock a Buy, with another four suggesting Hold. Analysts predict upside potential of more than 21% for shares, a potential boon for investors keen to access the mining industry. Like MARA, Cipher Mining Inc. NASDAQ: CIFR is primarily a Bitcoin mining operation. Its share price spike of about 47% in the last month is also likely due to its recent good news on that front. In the second quarter, Cipher outperformed its self-mining capacity guidance for its new Black Pearl site in Texas. The reported hash rate of 3.4 EH/s was well above the company's previous prediction of 2.5 EH/s. Now might be a good time for investors to join in the rally because Cipher anticipates further boosts to its hash rate in the coming months as other new mining rigs come online and the site installation is completed. This optimism is visible in the 11 Buy ratings analysts have provided CIFR shares, alongside forecasts for upside of 26%. Hut 8 NASDAQ: HUT focuses primarily on mining Bitcoin. It, too, has experienced a rally, with shares roughly doubling in price since late April. The company recently announced an expansion into regulation-friendly Dubai, a move that the company has said is about the efficiency of its capital strategy. Hut 8 is also tied with Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump via a venture called American Bitcoin Corp., which recently garnered $220 million in accredited investor support. But the primary driver of Hut's recent share price explosion may more likely be its successful deployment of its energy infrastructure outside of the cryptocurrency space. Mining firms like Hut require massive supplies of electricity for mining purposes, and the infrastructure necessary to support these activities can also be put to use for more traditional applications. Case in point, the company recently announced five-year capacity contracts for four of its natural gas-fired plants with the Ontario Independent Electricity System Operator. The contracts represent some 310 MW of power generation capacity in total. With rising energy demand and prices, pivoting in this way could prove to be highly lucrative for companies like Hut 8, and analysts think so too—HUT shares have a unanimous Buy rating from all 19 analysts, as well as 21% in upside potential.

US has reclosed its southern border after a flesh-eating parasite is seen further north in Mexico,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/us-has-reclosed-its-southern-border-after-a-flesh-eating-parasite-is-seen-further-north-in-mexico-2025-07-10/,"The U.S. has closed its southern border again to livestock imports, saying a flesh-eating parasite has moved further north in Mexico than previously reported. Mexico's president was critical Thursday, suggesting that the U.S. is exaggerating the threat to its beef industry from the parasite, the New World screwworm fly. The female flies lay eggs in wounds on warm-blooded animals, hatching larvae that are unusual among flies for feeding on live flesh and fluids instead of dead material. American officials worry that if the fly reaches Texas, its flesh-eating maggots could cause large economic losses, something that happened decades ago. The U.S. largely eradicated the pest in the 1970s by breeding and releasing sterile male flies to breed with wild females, and the fly had been contained in Panama for years until it was discovered in southern Mexico late last year. The U.S. closed its southern border in May to imports of live cattle, horses and bison but announced June 30 that it would allow three ports of entry to reopen this month and another two by Sept. 15. However, since then, an infestation from the fly has been reported 185 miles (298 kilometers) northeast of Mexico City, about 160 miles (258 kilometers) further north than previously reported cases. That was about 370 miles (595 kilometers) from the Texas border. “The United States has promised to be vigilant,” U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said in a statement Wednesday announcing the border closing. “Thanks to the aggressive monitoring by USDA staff in the U.S. and in Mexico, we have been able to take quick and decisive action to respond to the spread of this deadly pest.” In Mexico, President Claudia Sheinbaum said authorities there were following all established protocols to deal with the northernmost case. Mexican authorities said the country has 392 infected animals, down nearly 19% since June 24. “From our point of view, they took a totally exaggerated decision to closing the border again,” Sheinbaum said. “Everything that scientifically should be done is being done.” Three weeks ago, Rollins announced plans for combating the parasite that include spending nearly $30 million on new sites for breeding and dispersing sterile male flies. Once released in the wild, those males would mate with females, causing them to lay eggs that won’t hatch so that the fly population would die out. The USDA hopes a new fly factory will be operating in southern Mexico by July 2026 to supplement fly breeding at an existing complex in Panama. The agency also plans to open a site in southern Texas for holding sterile flies imported from Panama, so they can be released along the border if necessary. Also Thursday, U.S. Reps. Tony Gonzalez, of Texas, and Kat McCammack, of Florida, urged the Trump administration to quickly approve the use of existing anti-parasite treatments for New World screwworm fly infestations in livestock. They said labeling requirements currently prevent it. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

Alphabet: Technical Momentum Is Starting to Turn,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/alphabet-technical-momentum-is-starting-to-turn/,"Alphabet Inc. NASDAQ: GOOGL has trailed behind its mega-cap tech peers in 2025, with shares still down 7.8% year-to-date. While the broader market, led by the technology sector and many of the Magnificent Seven members, continues to hit new highs, GOOGL has remained one of the few laggards. However, recent price action and improving technical structure suggest that the tide may be turning in favor of the bulls. Technically speaking, Alphabet stock is showing early signs of a trend reversal. Shares have now bounced more than 24% off their 52-week low, which technically puts the stock back in bull market territory. More importantly, GOOGL has reclaimed its 200-day simple moving average (SMA), a widely followed level that many consider the line between long-term uptrends and downtrends. The reclaim of the 200-day SMA, particularly following several weeks of consolidation and underperformance, could signal a significant shift in sentiment and momentum. The next key level to watch is the $180 area, which has acted as strong resistance in recent months. A decisive breakout above that level is likely to confirm a shift in the trend, opening the door for a potential upside move toward $190 and beyond. The technical picture will remain constructive as long as the stock remains above its 200-day moving average and continues to build higher lows. Despite the recent rally, GOOGL remains an underperformer in 2025 compared to notable names such as NVIDIA, Meta, and Microsoft. Much of the recent lag is attributed to concerns surrounding AI monetization, increasing regulatory pressure in both the U.S. and Europe, and growing competition in the digital advertising and cloud infrastructure sectors. Still, the company’s fundamentals remain strong. Alphabet remains the global leader in search, holds dominant positions in YouTube and Android, and is aggressively expanding its AI capabilities through Gemini and AI Overviews. Meanwhile, its Google Cloud business continues to grow steadily, providing diversification beyond ad revenue. Notably, the company has a history of operational discipline and capital efficiency. Alphabet reported solid Q1 results, beating top-line earnings expectations, and remains on track for substantial margin expansion through 2025. With nearly $100 billion in cash and cash equivalents on hand, Alphabet also has the flexibility to invest in growth, repurchase shares, or even increase its dividend yield. The point is, despite the challenges it faces, it remains in a position to deal with them head-on and from a position of strength. Looking ahead, Alphabet is set to report Q2 earnings on July 22. And while the stock hasn’t participated in the broader rally just yet, its recent technical strength heading into earnings could be a positive signal. Should the company deliver another strong report and provide upbeat forward guidance, particularly around AI initiatives, its cloud business, or advertising, it could be the catalyst GOOGL needs to break through resistance decisively. The improving chart structure, combined with strong fundamentals and low expectations relative to its peers, sets the stage for a potential catch-up trade. In a market where many tech stocks are priced for perfection, Alphabet’s historically low P/E of 19.44 and forward P/E approaching the mid-teens gives it a more reasonable entry point for investors seeking both quality and value. While Alphabet has lagged in 2025, it now finds itself in a position of growing technical strength. A 24% rebound from the lows and a reclaim of the 200-day moving average mark a notable change in trend. If GOOGL can continue to consolidate and push above the $180 resistance level, it could confirm a longer-term shift that rewards patient bulls. For investors looking for a high-quality name with improving momentum, a dominant market position, and upside potential into the second half of the year, Alphabet is one to watch closely.

White House escalates pressure campaign on Fed chair by targeting its headquarters renovation,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/white-house-budget-director-accuses-fed-chair-of-violating-building-rules-in-renovation-2025-07-10/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is escalating his pressure campaign to get the Federal Reserve chairman to either lower interest rates or quit his post by targeting the expensive renovation at the central bank’s headquarters. The latest step came Thursday when Russ Vought, Trump’s top budget adviser, sent a letter to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell saying the president is “extremely troubled” that plans may have violated government building rules with an “ostentatious overhaul.” Trump also named two close aides to an obscure commission who plan to review the Federal Reserve building plans — another avenue to increase scrutiny on Powell, whose eight-year term formally ends next May. This follows a near-daily drumbeat of criticism that Trump has leveled at Powell, whom he has disparaged as “a very stupid person” who should “resign immediately.” It’s an unprecedented attempt to reshape the Federal Reserve’s traditional role as an autonomous arbiter of U.S. monetary policy. If successful in getting Powell to leave or getting interest rates lowered, Trump will have expanded his influence to yet another corner of American government that was once seen as beyond the reach of political pressure. But he also risks jeopardizing the independence that has made the central bank a foundational player in the U.S. economy. Powell has sought to avoid politics and refrains from responding directly to the president. Fed officials did not respond to an email seeking a response to the letter, though Powell has previously said that some parts of the renovation plans have changed. Powell has so far resisted Trump’s pressure to cut rates, largely out of concern that Trump’s tariff plans could increase costs for American consumers. If rates are lowered too aggressively, it could lead to a resurgence of inflation. But Trump insists that inflation is no longer a problem, and a rate cut would help make mortgages, auto loans and other forms of consumer debt cheaper. Trump has also said it would allow the U.S. government to finance its debt more cheaply, a pressing concern as legislation signed by the president is poised to increase the federal deficit by extending tax cuts. “LOWER THE RATE!!!” Trump wrote on social media on Thursday. However, there’s no guarantee that financial markets will reduce rates on government debt even if the Fed bows to Trump’s wishes. Such a situation could lead to higher interest costs for consumers — a reminder of how monetary missteps may backfire. Powell was nominated to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors by President Barack Obama, then made chairman by Trump during his first term. But in his second term, Trump turned Powell into one of his primary antagonists. Trump has said that he wouldn’t directly oust Powell. “I don’t know why it would be so bad, but I’m not going to fire him,” he said last month. The Supreme Court said in May that it could block such a step. However, Trump's allies have found other ways to make Powell uncomfortable. Bill Pulte, the Trump-appointed director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, also accused Powell of lying to Congress about the renovations. “I am asking Congress to investigate Chairman Jerome Powell, his political bias, and his deceptive Senate testimony, which is enough to be removed ‘for cause,’” he said last week. Pulte said the situation “stinks to high heaven.” Trump's naming of James Blair, a deputy chief of staff, and Will Scharf, the staff secretary who furnishes the president with executive orders for his signature, to the National Capital Planning Commission also potentially ratchets up the pressure on Powell. Blair said he would be “requesting a review of all previous and current building plans” and suggested that Powell wasn’t honest while testifying to Congress about the renovations last month. If Powell isn’t truthful, Blair wrote on social media, “how else is the American Public to maintain confidence that its monetary policy manager is acting in their interests?” Vought, in his own letter, called the initial renovation plans featuring rooftop terrace gardens, VIP dining rooms and premium marble an “ostentatious overhaul.” Vought also suggested that Powell misled Congress by saying the headquarters had never had a serious renovation, saying that an update to its roof and building systems that was completed in 2003 counts as a “comprehensive” renovation. Powell said in Senate testimony last month that some of the elements in the 2021 plan, such as the dining rooms and rooftop terraces, are no longer part of the project for the 90-year-old Marriner S. Eccles Building. The debate over the renovation could set up a legal battle between the White House and the Fed, which under the law is allowed to use its own judgment to establish “suitable” and “adequate” quarters for its operations. Sung Won Sohn, a finance and economics professor at Loyola-Marymount University, said, “It’s good that the central bank budget is coming under review and scrutiny.” However, he warned against using such issues to challenge the Fed’s independence. If that’s compromised, he said, it’s “bad for the economy, that’s bad for inflation expectations and therefore long term inflation.” ___ Associated Press writer Fatima Hussein contributed to this report.

AI device startup that sued OpenAI and Jony Ive is now suing its own ex-employee over trade secrets,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/ai-device-startup-that-sued-openai-and-jony-ive-is-now-suing-its-own-ex-employee-over-trade-secrets-2025-07-10/,"A secretive competition to pioneer a new way of communicating with artificial intelligence chatbots is getting a messy public airing as OpenAI fights a trademark dispute over its stealth hardware collaboration with legendary iPhone designer Jony Ive. In the latest twist, tech startup iyO Inc., which already sued Ive and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman for trademark infringement, is now suing one of its own former employees for allegedly leaking a confidential drawing of iyO's unreleased product. At the heart of this bitter legal wrangling is a big idea: we shouldn't need to stare at computer or phone screens or talk to a box like Amazon's Alexa to interact with our future AI assistants in a natural way. And whoever comes up with this new AI interface could profit immensely from it. OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT, started to outline its own vision in May by buying io Products, a product and engineering company co-founded by Ive, in a deal valued at nearly $6.5 billion. Soon after, iyO sued for trademark infringement for the similar sounding name and because of the firms' past interactions. U.S. District Judge Trina Thompson ruled last month that iyO has a strong enough case to proceed to a hearing this fall. Until then, she ordered Altman, Ive and OpenAI to refrain from using the io brand, leading them to take down the web page and all mentions of the venture. A second lawsuit from iyO filed this week in San Francisco Superior Court accuses a former iyO executive, Dan Sargent, of breach of contract and misappropriation of trade secrets over his meetings with another io co-founder, Tang Yew Tan, a close Ive ally who led design of the Apple Watch. Sargent left iyO in December and now works for Apple. He and Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. “This is not an action we take lightly,” said iyO CEO Jason Rugolo in a statement Thursday. “Our primary goal here is not to target a former employee, whom we considered a friend, but to hold accountable those whom we believe preyed on him from a position of power.” Rugolo told The Associated Press last month that he thought he was on the right path in 2022 when he pitched his ideas and showed off his prototypes to firms tied to Altman and Ive. Rugolo later publicly expanded on his earbud-like “audio computer"" product in a TED Talk last year. What he didn't know was that, by 2023, Ive and Altman had begun quietly collaborating on their own AI hardware initiative. “I’m happy to compete on product, but calling it the same name, that part is just amazing to me. And it was shocking,” Rugolo said in an interview. The new venture was revealed publicly in a May video announcement, and to Rugolo about two months earlier after he had emailed Altman with an investment pitch. “thanks but im working on something competitive so will (respectfully) pass!” Altman wrote to Rugolo in March, adding in parentheses that it was called io. Altman has dismissed iyO's lawsuit on social media as a “silly, disappointing and wrong” move from a “quite persistent” Rugolo. Other executives in court documents characterized the product Rugolo was pitching as a failed one that didn't work properly in a demo. Altman said in a written declaration that he and Ive chose the name two years ago in reference to the concept of “input/output” that describes how a computer receives and transmits information. Neither io nor iyO was first to play with the phrasing — Google’s flagship annual technology showcase is called I/O — but Altman said he and Ive acquired the io.com domain name in August 2023. The idea was “to create products that go beyond traditional products and interfaces,” Altman said. “We want to create new ways for people to input their requests and new ways for them to receive helpful outputs, powered by AI.” A number of startups have already tried, and mostly failed, to build gadgetry for AI interactions. The startup Humane developed a wearable pin that you could talk to, but the product was poorly reviewed and the startup discontinued sales after HP acquired its assets earlier this year. Altman has suggested that io's version could be different. He said in a now-removed video that he's already trying a prototype at home that Ive gave him, calling it “the coolest piece of technology that the world will have ever seen.” Altman and Ive still haven't said is what exactly it is. The court case, however, has forced their team to disclose what it's not. “Its design is not yet finalized, but it is not an in-ear device, nor a wearable device,” said Tan in a court declaration that sought to distance the venture from iyO's product. It was that same declaration that led iyO to sue Sargent this week. Tan revealed in the filing that he had talked to a “now former” iyO engineer who was looking for a job because of his frustration with “iyO’s slow pace, unscalable product plans, and continued acceptance of preorders without a sellable product.” Those conversations with the unnamed employee led Tan to conclude “that iyO was basically offering ‘vaporware’ — advertising for a product that does not actually exist or function as advertised, and my instinct was to avoid meeting with iyO myself and to discourage others from doing so.” IyO said its investigators recently reached out to Sargent and confirmed he was the one who met with Tan. Rugolo told the AP he feels duped after he first pitched his idea to Altman in 2022 through the Apollo Projects, a venture capital firm started by Altman and his brothers. Rugolo said he demonstrated his products and the firm politely declined, with the explanation that they don’t do consumer hardware investments. That same year, Rugolo also pitched the same idea to Ive through LoveFrom, the San Francisco design firm started by Ive after his 27-year career at Apple. Ive's firm also declined. “I feel kind of stupid now,” Rugolo added. “Because we talked for so long. I met with them so many times and demo'd all their people — at least seven people there. Met with them in person a bunch of times, talking about all our ideas.” ———————- The Associated Press and OpenAI have a licensing and technology agreement that allows OpenAI access to part of AP’s text archives.

Senate Republicans block attempt to roll back massive tax hike on professional gamblers,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/senate-republicans-block-attempt-to-roll-back-massive-tax-hike-on-professional-gamblers-2025-07-10/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate Republicans on Thursday blocked an attempt to reverse a little-noticed provision from their tax and spending cuts law that professional gamblers warn could be the end of their industry. Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada sought unanimous passage of a bill that would roll back the change on gambling tax deductions, but Republican Sen. Todd Young of Indiana objected, stalling the proposal for now. The emerging fight over the gambling provision is likely only the beginning of the fallout from the new tax law and its impact on the country. Spanning more than 900 pages, the bill signed into law by President Donald Trump last week contained a slew of provisions changing federal programs and the tax code, many of which lawmakers admit they are only now beginning to fully digest. “My understanding is many Republicans, many Democrats did not even know it was part of that process,” Cortez Masto said of the gambling provision. Under the new tax law, starting in 2026, individuals can only deduct 90% of their gambling losses up to the amount of their winnings. That’s a change from the previous rule, which allowed gamblers to deduct 100% of their losses, up to the amount they won. The change will only significantly impact those who gamble larger amounts and who take the extra steps to itemize and deduct their losses. But for those individuals, the impact could be steep. In practice, for example, under the old rule, someone who wins $100,000 and loses $100,000 could deduct the full $100,000 in losses and owe nothing. Under the new rule, they would only be able to deduct $90,000 and would still owe taxes on the remaining $10,000, despite having lost all their winnings. “This new amendment to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act would end professional gambling in the U.S. and hurt casual gamblers, too,” Phil Galfond, a professional poker player, said on social media just days ahead of the bill's final passage. The provision was included in the bill's text released on June 16 by Senate Finance Committee Chair Mike Crapo. Some senators have said they weren't aware of the provision, and it only publicly came to light days ahead of the bill's passage, with professional gamblers and media figures drawing attention to it. “Now I see Republican senators walking all over the Capitol saying they didn’t even know anything about this policy,"" said Sen. Ron Wyden, the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. “The fact is, when you rush a process like this, this way, and cram in all of these policies that you haven’t really thought about, you risk consequences for people back home. That is what is going on here,” Wyden. said The provision is estimated to generate over $1.1 billion in tax revenue over eight years. The entirety of the tax break and spending cuts bill will increase the deficit by nearly $3.3 trillion from 2025 to 2034, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Republicans say it was a necessary procedural change tied to the reconciliation process, which allowed them to pass the sweeping bill without Democratic support. Young, the Indiana Republican who objected to Cortez Masto’s bill, said he supports the policy but would only agree to undo it if Democrats accepted other provisions in return. “I strongly support the underlying bill, but will have to object unless you can agree to my request,” Young said on the Senate floor. Thursday's attempt by Cortez Masto won't be the last. On Wednesday, she introduced a bill that will first have to go through committee, but has bipartisan support, to restore the full gambling deduction. In the House, Nevada Democratic Rep. Dina Titus has also introduced a bill attempting to return to the previous standard. ___ Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

"Ford recalls over 850,000 cars in the US due to potential fuel pump failure",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/ford-recalls-over-850000-cars-in-the-us-due-to-potential-fuel-pump-failure-2025-07-10/,"NEW YORK (AP) — Ford is recalling more than 850,000 of its cars across the U.S. because the low-pressure fuel pump inside the vehicles may fail — and potentially cause an engine stall while driving, increasing crash risks. The recall covers a wide range of Ford and Lincoln-branded vehicles made in recent model years. That includes certain Ford Broncos, Explorers and F-150s, as well as Lincoln Aviators and Navigators, documents published this week by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration note. Ford plans to send out notification letters to affected owners starting this Monday (July 14), to warn of safety risks related to potential fuel pump failure. But a remedy is still “under development,” the NHTSA's recall report notes. It wasn't immediately clear if there was an estimate for when a fix would become available. But this week's recall report noted that owners will receive an additional letter with instructions to take their car to an authorized dealer for that service when the time comes — and that there will be no charge. The Associated Press reached out to Ford for further comments Thursday. The Michigan-based automaker isn't aware of any accidents or injuries related to this recall, this week's report notes. But owners should look out for potential warnings. Prior to fuel pump failure, customers may encounter poor engine performance, for example, a check engine light or a decrease in engine power. Fuel pump failure is “more likely to occur” during warm weather or if there’s low fuel in the tank, the recall report notes. And loss of fuel pressure and flow can be caused by internal contamination of a car’s jet pump, amid other factors. Ford also identified supplier changes during a review of the manufacturing process, the report adds. Ford estimates that 10% of the 850,318 vehicles it's recalling in the U.S. have this fuel pump risk. The recall covers certain Ford Broncos, Explorers and Lincoln Aviators between the 2021 and 2023 model years, in addition to 2021-2023 model year F-250 SD, F-350 SD, F-450 SD and F-550 SD vehicles. Select 2021-2022 Lincoln Navigators, Ford Mustangs and F-150s are also impacted, as well as some 2022 Expeditions. Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

"Nebius Group: Up 385%, Analysts Say It’s Still a Bargain",https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/nebius-group-up-385-analysts-say-its-still-a-bargain/,"The search for the next impactful name in artificial intelligence (AI) often leads investors to crowded fields. Yet, quietly capturing a significant market share is Nebius Group N.V. NASDAQ: NBIS. This international AI cloud provider delivered a staggering 385% year-over-year revenue growth in its latest quarter. This narrative of rapid expansion becomes even more compelling when you consider that the company is backed by a Buy consensus rating from Wall Street analysts, who see a clear path to significant upside, suggesting the market has yet to fully price in the company's potential. Nebius Group’s financial performance paints a clear picture of potent market demand. For the first quarter of 2025, the company reported revenues of $55.3 million (up 385% from last year). This growth was driven by its core business of providing the specialized infrastructure that companies desperately need to build and run sophisticated AI models. For investors, top-line growth is compelling, but predictable revenue is even better. This is where Nebius’s Annualized Recurring Revenue (ARR) becomes a critical indicator. ARR, which measures predictable income from subscriptions, soared to $310 million by April 2025. This metric is highly valued because it signifies a stable and growing base of loyal customers, giving strong credibility to management’s full-year revenue guidance of $500 million to $700 million. Of course, rapid growth often comes at the cost of profitability. However, Nebius has provided a clear catalyst for investors to watch. Management has confidently guided that it expects to reach adjusted EBITDA break-even in the second half of 2025. Achieving this milestone would be a significant de-risking event for the stock, demonstrating that the underlying business model is fundamentally sound and can generate profits even as it continues to invest in scaling its operations. In a market dominated by cloud titans, Nebius thrives not by competing head-on, but by specializing. The company has engineered a competitive advantage through its full-stack platform. This means it controls the entire technology pipeline, from designing its server hardware to writing the proprietary software that manages it. This integration enables a level of optimization that general-purpose clouds using off-the-shelf components cannot easily achieve. The problem Nebius solves is specific. AI models require massive amounts of data to be processed simultaneously across thousands of computer chips. A general-purpose cloud can create bottlenecks, slowing down training and increasing costs. The Nebius platform is purpose-built to handle these intensive, parallel workloads with maximum efficiency. This technical expertise is validated by its key industry partnerships. As a launch partner for NVIDIA’s NASDAQ: NVDA latest chips, Nebius ensures its clients get early access to the most powerful AI hardware available, creating a significant advantage in a fast-moving industry. This focus is further sharpened by strategic decisions, such as the recent deconsolidation of its Toloka data unit, which enables the company to concentrate all its resources on its core, high-margin AI infrastructure business. An ambitious vision requires the capital to make it a reality. Nebius recently secured its financial future with a $1 billion convertible note offering. Convertible notes are a hybrid security that starts as debt but can convert into stock later, a method often used by growth companies to raise capital with less immediate dilution to existing shareholders. This billion-dollar war chest ensures Nebius has the funding to aggressively expand its data center footprint and acquire the compute power needed to meet customer demand, directly fueling its future revenue. Beyond capital, Nebius has attracted validation from the highest levels of the tech world. A recent strategic investment in its Toloka business was led by Bezos Expeditions, the personal investment firm of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. This kind of smart money validation provides far more than just cash; it confers immense credibility. The association with a name like Bezos signals a strong belief in the company's technology and long-term vision, which can attract other top-tier investors, partners, and talent. The ultimate question for investors is what a stock is worth. While Nebius is not yet profitable by standard accounting, Wall Street is looking ahead. All six analysts covering the company rate the stock a Buy, reflecting a strong consensus among professionals that its future is bright. This optimism is reflected in their price targets. The average twelve-month forecast for Nebius is $66.50 per share, which represents a potential upside of over 40% from its current price. The highest target is set at $84.00, suggesting that some analysts believe the growth potential is even greater. For a hyper-growth company, valuation is often less about past performance and more about future potential. Analysts are signaling that as Nebius continues to execute on its growth plan and reaches its profitability goals, its stock price will be rerated higher to match its standing as a critical player in the AI ecosystem. Nebius Group is charting a compelling course in the competitive AI landscape. With verifiable hyper-growth, a differentiated technology stack, and the strong backing of both Wall Street and elite investors, the company presents a clear, data-driven case for investors seeking a focused, high-potential play on the future of artificial intelligence.

Boeing's Rebound Is Well Underway—But Is It Too Late?,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/boeings-rebound-is-well-underwaybut-is-it-too-late/,"Boeing NYSE: BA has been one of the most maligned titans of industry in the United States over the past several years. As of the July 8 close, the stock’s five-year total return was only 22%. The aerospace stock has massively underperformed the market, as the S&P 500 Index’s return was approximately 112% over this period. Boeing stock started 2025 off in a bad way, with shares falling to depths of -23% through early April. However, the company managed to completely flip the script as the year progressed. As of the June 8 close, Boeing stock is now up 23% in 2025, far outpacing the approximately 6% return of the S&P 500. This strong stock market performance accompanies the big improvement in the firm’s operational success, which it just made clear to the public. Now, the question is whether Boeing’s recent success is sustainable, or is it too late for the company to regain its former glory? Let’s break down the latest news around the company to form an outlook on the stock. On July 8, Boeing announced massive improvements in its plane deliveries compared to a year ago. The company said it delivered 60 commercial planes in June, marking a 27% increase in deliveries compared to the same period a year ago. Through the first half of 2025, the company’s commercial plane deliveries came in at 280. That is a 60% increase versus the first half of 2024. The company’s Defense, Space, and Security deliveries have improved significantly as well, coming in at 62. That is a nearly 48% increase from 42 in the first half of 2024. Crystalizing the improvement in the firm’s operations is the fact that its deliveries in June were the highest since December 2023. Deliveries are a very important metric in assessing the competitiveness of Boeing versus its rival Airbus Group OTCMKTS: EADSY. Planes are costly and take a long time to build. Thus, customers must have confidence that Boeing will deliver in a timely fashion to win orders over Airbus. Airbus is still winning the battle in 2025, delivering 306 planes through the first half of the year and 63 in June. However, Boeing is gaining ground. While its deliveries have skyrocketed compared to 2024, Airbus’s deliveries fell by around 5.6%. However, more important than timely delivery is the perception that Boeing’s planes are safe. This has been the bane of Boeing’s existence over the past several years and is the main thing it needs to change. The June 12 Air India crash of the company’s 787 Dreamliner is just the latest setback to the company’s efforts to promote its perception of safety. So far, no clear blame has fallen on Boeing. Authorities will likely release the details of the preliminary investigation soon. Regulators finding Boeing at fault would be a clear catalyst for shares to move down. The crash came at a particularly bad time for Boeing. The firm retreated into the shadows during the Paris Air Show, while Airbus raked in $21 billion in orders. The company has made efforts to improve the safety of its planes. It hired a new Chief Executive Officer back in August 2024 to help shift the company’s culture. It is also working to complete the purchase of key supplier Spirit AeroSystems NYSE: SPR to improve its quality control. Notably, airline executives have expressed confidence in the safety and quality improvements Boeing is making. Still, it will take years to assess whether Boeing’s safety issues are truly behind them. One saving grace for Boeing is its massive backlog, which stood at 5,953 planes at the end of June. At its current delivery pace, it would take the firm more than a decade to fulfill all these orders. Despite its issues, the demand for the company’s products remains strong, giving Boeing a big opportunity to succeed going forward if it can show that its house is in order. This means that the recovery Boeing is currently seeing is not too little, too late. However, the company still has a huge amount to prove. If Boeing’s execution continues to improve, the stock has the ability to appreciate strongly over the coming years. For perspective, the stock would need to gain approximately 51% to reclaim the all-time high it achieved in March 2019. Before you consider Boeing, you'll want to hear this.

Woman convicted of stowing away on flight to Paris faces extradition to Connecticut,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/woman-convicted-of-stowing-away-on-flight-to-paris-faces-extradition-to-connecticut-2025-07-10/,"NEW YORK (AP) — A woman convicted of stowing away on a flight from New York to Paris without a boarding pass or a passport won’t be released from custody as she faces new charges of breaching security at a Connecticut airport. Svetlana Dali was sentenced Thursday to time already served for her illegal ride to Paris last year. But a federal judge in Brooklyn said she would not be released as Connecticut authorities are seeking to extradite her to face felony charges that could have her serving up to five years behind bars if convicted. The 57-year-old, who is originally from Russia but has a green card, has been held in a federal lockup in Brooklyn for roughly seven months. Connecticut State Police confirmed after the hearing that they have an active arrest warrant against Dali, but, in an emailed statement, said release of any further information would be “dependent on an arrest being made"" in Connecticut. During her sentencing Thursday, Dali spoke for more than half an hour, repeating in detail her claim that she believes she is being poisoned by unknown persons. She pleaded with the judge to order medical tests to prove her fears, which she said had prompted her to attempt to flee the country by boarding the Paris flight illegally. “All of these actions were taken in order to save my life,” Dali said in Russian through a translator. Prosecutors say that on Nov. 24, 2024, Dali was able to get through security checkpoints at Bradley International Airport near Hartford, Connecticut, by hiding among other passengers. She wasn’t able to board a plane, but two days later, she successfully evaded security at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York and boarded a plane bound for Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris. Prosecutors said Dali was initially rebuffed by a Transportation Security Administration official when she was unable to produce a boarding pass. But she was able to get through a special security lane for airline employees by joining a large flight crew for Air Europa as they were screened and patted down. At the gate for the Paris flight, surveillance video showed Dali sneaking past Delta Air Lines staff checking tickets by again blending into a large group of passengers. On the plane, prosecutors say Dali hid in a bathroom for hours and wasn’t discovered by Delta crew members until the plane was nearing Paris. During her trial, Dali took the stand in her defense, maintaining she was never asked to show her boarding pass at the gate in JFK and had gone into the airplane bathroom because she was feeling sick. She was initially released after her arrest, but was apprehended in Buffalo, New York, after authorities said she cut off her electronic monitor and attempted to enter Canada. Prosecutors have said Dali also appears to have flown into Miami International Airport illegally. In February 2024, U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents discovered her hiding in a bathroom in a secured area in the international arrivals zone.
