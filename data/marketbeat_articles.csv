"Trump’s tariff pressure pushes Asia toward American LNG, but at the cost of climate goals",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trumps-tariff-pressure-pushes-asia-toward-american-lng-but-at-the-cost-of-climate-goals-2025-07-18/,"HANOI, Vietnam (AP) — Asian countries are offering to buy more U.S. liquefied natural gas in negotiations with the Trump administration as a way to alleviate tensions over U.S. trade deficits and forestall higher tariffs. Analysts warn that strategy could undermine those countries' long-term climate ambitions and energy security. Buying more U.S. LNG has topped the list of concessions Asian countries have offered in talks with Washington over President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs on foreign goods. Vietnam's Prime Minister underlined the need to buy more of the super-chilled fuel in a government meeting, and the government signed a deal in May with an American company to develop a gas import hub. JERA, Japan’s largest power generator, signed new 20-year contracts last month to purchase up to 5.5 million metric tons of U.S. gas annually starting around 2030. U.S. efforts to sell more LNG to Asia predate the Trump administration, but they've gained momentum with his intense push to win trade deals. Liquefied natural gas, or LNG, is natural gas cooled to a liquid form for easy storage and transport that is used as a fuel for transport, residential cooking and heating and industrial processes. Trump discussed cooperation on a $44 billion Alaska LNG project with South Korea, prompting a visit by officials to the site in June. The U.S. president has promoted the project as a way to supply gas from Alaska’s vast North Slope to a liquefication plant at Nikiski in south-central Alaska, with an eye largely on exports to Asian countries while bypassing the Panama Canal Thailand has offered to commit to a long-term deal for American fuel and shown interest in the same Alaska project to build a nearly 810-mile (1,300-kilometer) pipeline that would funnel gas from The Philippines is also considering importing gas from Alaska while India is mulling a plan to scrap import taxes on U.S. energy shipments to help narrow its trade surplus with Washington. “Trump has put pressure on a seeming plethora of Asian trading partners to buy more U.S. LNG,” said Tim Daiss, at the APAC Energy Consultancy, pointing out that Japan had agreed to buy more despite being so “awash in the fuel” that it was being forced to cancel projects and contracts to offload the excess to Asia's growing economies. “Not good for Southeast Asia's sustainability goals,” he said. Experts say LNG purchasing agreements can slow adoption of renewable energy in Asia. Locking into long-term deals could leave countries with outdated infrastructure as the world shifts rapidly toward cleaner energy sources like solar or wind that offer faster, more affordable ways to meet growing power demand, said Indra Overland, head of the Center for Energy Research at the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs. Building pipelines, terminals, and even household gas stoves creates systems that are expensive and difficult to replace—making it harder to switch to renewables later. “And you’re more likely then to get stuck for longer,” he said. Energy companies that profit from gas or coal are powerful vested interests, swaying policy to favor their business models, he said. LNG burns cleaner than coal, but it’s still a fossil fuel that emits greenhouse gases and contributes to climate change. Many LNG contracts include “take-or-pay” clauses, obliging governments to pay even if they don’t use the fuel. Christopher Doleman of the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis warns that if renewable energy grows fast, reducing the need for LNG, countries may still have to pay for gas they no longer need. Pakistan is an example. Soaring LNG costs drove up electricity prices, pushing consumers to install rooftop solar panels. As demand for power drops and gas supply surges, the country is deferring LNG shipments and trying to resell excess fuel. Experts said that although countries are signaling a willingness to import more U.S. LNG, they're unlikely to import enough to have a meaningful impact on U.S. trade deficits. South Korea would need to import 121 million metric tons of LNG in a year — 50% more than the total amount of LNG the U.S. exported globally last year and triple what South Korea imported, said Doleman. Vietnam — with a trade surplus with the U.S. twice the size of Korea’s — would need to import 181 million metric tons annually, more than double what the U.S. exported last year. Other obstacles stand in the way. The Alaska LNG project is widely considered uneconomic. Both coal and renewable energy in Asia are so much cheaper that U.S. gas would need to cost less than half its current price to compete. Tariffs on Chinese steel could make building building gas pipelines and LNG terminals more expensive, while longstanding delays to build new gas turbines mean new gas power projects may not come online until 2032. Meanwhile, a global glut in LNG will likely drive prices lower, making it even harder for countries to justify locking into long-term deals with the United States at current higher prices. Committing to long-term U.S. LNG contracts could impact regional energy security at a time of growing geopolitical and market uncertainties, analysts said. A core concern is over the longterm stability of the U.S. as a trading partner, said Overland. “The U.S. is not a very predictable entity. And to rely on energy from there is a very risky proposition,” he said. LNG only contributes to energy security when it’s available and affordable, says Dario Kenner of Zero Carbon Analytics. “That’s the bit that they leave out ... But it’s pretty important,” he said. This was the concern during the recent potential disruptions to fuel shipments through the Strait of Hormuz and earlier during the war in Ukraine, when LNG cargoes originally destined for Asia were rerouted to Europe. Despite having contracts, Asian countries like Bangladesh and Sri Lanka were outbid by European buyers. “Events in Europe, which can seem very far away, can have an impact on availability and prices in Asia,” Kenner said. Asian countries can improve their energy security and make progress toward cutting carbon emissions by building more renewable energy, he said, noting there is vast room for that given that only about 1% of Southeast Asia’s solar and wind potential is being used. “There are genuine choices to meet rising electricity demand. It is not just having to build LNG,” he said. ___ Jintamas Saksornchai in Bangkok contributed to this report. ___ Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receive support from several private foundations.

Asian shares mostly advance after Wall Street cruises to more records,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/asian-shares-mostly-advance-after-wall-street-cruises-to-more-records-2025-07-18/,"MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Asian shares were mostly higher on Friday after Wall Street rose to records following better-than-expected updates on the economy and a mixed set of profit reports from big U.S. companies. Japan’s Nikkei 225 edged 0.1% lower to 39,854.28 as traders stayed on the sidelines ahead of an election for the upper house of parliament on Sunday that could wipe out the ruling coalition’s upper house majority. The government reported that core inflation excluding volatile food and energy prices rose to 3.3% in June from a year earlier, slowing from 3.7% in May but still above the central bank’s 2% target. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index added 0.7% to 24,676.64, while the Shanghai Composite index advanced 0.3% to 3,528.90. Taiwan’s Taiex climbed 0.9%, helped by a 2.2% gain for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. On Thursday, TSMC reported its net income soared nearly 61% in the last quarter from a year earlier. The world's largest contract chip maker said it’s seeing strong demand from artificial-intelligence and other customers. On Thursday, TSMC’s stock that trades in the United States rose 3.4%. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 1.5% to 8,765.00, and the Kospi in South Korea shed 0.6% to 3,173.69. India's Sensex shed 0.3%. “Asia’s riding the global rally wave, AI fever refuses to break, and even the Fed is making soothing noises,” Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management wrote in a commentary. “But underneath all the sunshine is a market running hot, with volatility on sale and positioning still cautious.” On Thursday, the S&P 500 climbed 0.5% to top its all-time high set a week ago, closing at 6,297.36. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5% to 44,484.49, and the Nasdaq composite added 0.7% to its own record set the day before, climbing to 20,885.65. Trading was calmer than on Wednesday, when President Donald Trump rocked financial markets by saying he had discussed the “concept” of firing the chair of the Federal Reserve, though he said he was unlikely to do so. Such a move could help Wall Street get the lower interest rates investors love, but would also risk a weakened Fed unable to make the unpopular moves needed to keep inflation under control. Apart from TSMC, other stocks involved in AI also climbed. A 1% gain for Nvidia was one of the strongest forces pushing upward on the S&P 500. PepsiCo jumped 7.5% after delivering revenue and profit that topped Wall Street’s expectations. Treasury yields were mixed following several better-than-expected reports on the economy. One said that shoppers upped their spending  at U.S. retailers by more last month than economists expected. Such spending, along with a relatively solid jobs market, has helped keep the U.S. economy out of a recession. A separate report said that fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits  last week, which could be a signal of limited layoffs. A third suggested unexpectedly strong growth in manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic region. Such solid data could keep the Federal Reserve on pause when it comes to interest rates. The Fed has been keeping rates steady this year, after cutting them at the end of last year. The Fed’s chair, Jerome Powell, has been insisting that he wants to wait for more data about how Trump’s tariffs will affect the economy and inflation before the Fed makes its next move. That’s because while lower interest rates could boost the economy and prices for investments, they would also give inflation more fuel. Prices may already be starting to feel the upward effects of tariffs, based on the latest data. In other dealings on Friday, U.S. benchmark crude oil rose 33 cents to $66.56 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, also was up 33 cents, at $69.85 per barrel. The U.S. dollar edged slightly higher to 148.67 against the Japanese yen from 148.61. The euro rose to $1.1623 from $1.1596. ___ AP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed. Before you consider Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, you'll want to hear this.

"Shutdowns of cellphone internet links sweep Russia, further limiting already-stifled net freedom",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/shutdowns-of-cellphone-internet-links-sweep-russia-further-limiting-already-stifled-net-freedom-2025-07-17/,"TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — A snappy tune by a blogger that mockingly laments his poor internet connection in the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don has gotten over a half-million views on Instagram in two weeks. “How to say you’re from Rostov without saying a word? Show one bar of cellphone service,"" Pavel Osipyan raps while walking around the city, smartphone in hand. ""We have internet until 12 o'clock, and recently there’s been no connection at all. No need to be angry, just get used to it already.” The complaints by Osipyan — unable to pay electronically for groceries, or having to use paper maps while driving — aren't isolated to Rostov-on-Don, which borders Ukraine and, as home to Russia's Southern Military District, is targeted frequently by drones. In the last two months, cellphone internet shutdowns, which officials say are needed to foil Ukrainian drones, have hit dozens of Russian regions — from those near the fighting to parts of Siberia and even the Far East. Some Wi-Fi outages also have been reported. Russians contacted by The Associated Press talked about card payments not going through, taxi and ride-sharing apps not working properly, ATMs that sometimes fail. Experts point to the unprecedented nature of the measures and warn of far-reaching consequences in a country where the Kremlin already has significantly curtailed online freedom. Such shutdowns in the name of security legitimize them to the public and open the door for authorities abusing the restrictions, said Anastasiya Zhyrmont, policy manager for Eastern Europe and Central Asia at the Access Now digital rights group. Experts say the trend began in May, when Russia celebrated the 80th anniversary of the defeat of the Nazi Germany in World War II and foreign dignitaries flocked to Moscow for a big military parade. The capital suffered severe disruptions of cellphone connectivity to the internet for days, and Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed those were deliberate restrictions due to regular Ukrainian drone attacks. Asked how long they'd last, he replied, ""This will be done as needed.” Russia has restricted smartphone connectivity before, with isolated instances during protests, as well as in regions bordering Ukraine. Shutdowns in the capital, however, sent a signal to authorities across the vast country that it’s a useful tool, said lawyer Sarkis Darbinyan, founder of Russian internet freedom group Roskomsvoboda. Ukraine’s ""Operation Spiderweb” in early June, in which drones launched from containers on trucks attacked airfields deep inside Russia, made officials all the more eager to take action, Darbinyan said. “They got really scared that drones now may appear, like a jack-in-the-box, in any Russian regions,” he told AP. By mid-July, deliberate shutdowns spread to most of the country, according to Na Svyazi — Russian for “staying connected” — an activist group tracking internet availability. On Tuesday, the group reported cellphone internet shutdowns in 73 of over 80 regions. In 41 of them, there were reports of broadband network outages as well, while restrictions on broadband internet occurred in six regions, while cellphone connections were fine. Some regional officials confirmed that cellphone internet was restricted for security reasons. Nizhny Novgorod Gov. Gleb Nikitin said this month the measure will stay in place in the region east of Moscow for “as long as the threat remains.” Asked Thursday whether such mass shutdowns were justified, Peskov said “everything that has to do with ensuring the safety of citizens, everything is justified and everything is a priority.” Russians from affected regions say the outages can last for hours or days; patterns also are hard to discern, with service working in one part of a city but vanishing elsewhere. In Voronezh, near Ukraine and frequently targeted by drones, one resident said she felt like she was in “a cave” in early July with no cellphone internet or Wi-Fi in her home. The woman, who spoke to AP on condition of anonymity because of security concerns, said she was only able to get online at work the next day. Cellphone internet in the southwestern city of Samara ""goes out at the most unpredictable moments,” said Natalia, who also spoke on condition that her last name be withheld for safety reasons. Her home Wi-Fi recently also has slowed to a near halt around 11 p.m., staying that way for a few hours, she said. Connectivity has improved recently in the Siberian city of Omsk, said Viktor Shkurenko, who owns retail stores and other businesses there. But cellphone internet service was out in his office for an entire week. A few of his smaller stores that rely on cellphone networks suffered disruptions, but nothing critical, he said. “I don’t feel any super strong discomfort,"" said Grigori Khromov of Nizhny Novgorod, Russia’s fifth-largest city where regular and widespread shutdowns were reported. ""I have an office job and I work either at home or in the office and have either wire internet or Wi-Fi.” In rural areas, small towns and villages, where cellphone internet often is the only way to get online, the situation was harder to gauge. Pharmacies in such areas have struggled, Russian media reported and the Independent Pharmacies Association confirmed to AP. Viktoria Presnyakova, head of the association, said in a statement that prescriptions must be logged in special software, but that becomes impossible without an internet connection for weeks. A social media user in the Belgorod region bordering Ukraine complained on Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov’s social media page that without cellphone internet and a working alarm system, village residents have to bang on a rail to warn neighbors of an attack. The authorities promised to look into improving connectivity in the area. Authorities elsewhere also announced steps to minimize disruptions by opening Wi-Fi spots. They also are reportedly planning to establish an agency to coordinate the shutdowns, according to Izvestia, a Kremlin-backed newspaper that cited unidentified government sources. Peskov said he was unaware of the plan. Russian and Ukrainian drones use cellphone internet networks to operate, so shutdowns are one way authorities try to counter the attacks, said Kateryna Stepanenko, a Russia analyst at the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War. But it's also part of the Kremlin's long-term effort to rein in the internet. Authorities have actively censored online content in the last decade, blocking thousands of websites of independent media, opposition groups and human rights organizations. After Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the government blocked major social media like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, as well as encrypted messenger platform Signal and a few other messaging apps. Access to YouTube — wildly popular in Russia — was disrupted last year in what experts called deliberate throttling by the authorities. The Kremlin blamed YouTube owner Google for not properly maintaining its hardware in Russia. State internet watchdogs routinely block virtual private network services that help circumvent the restrictions, and there are plans to introduce a national messenger app, expected to replace foreign ones. Along with the shutdowns, these are part of a larger campaign “to establish control over the internet, which is something the Kremlin had failed to do 20 years prior on the same level that China did,” said the ISW's Stepanenko. Access Now's Zhyrmont says it's “very disturbing” that Russians have gotten used to living with growing internet restrictions, including shutdowns. “This shouldn't be modern reality,” she said.

"Former Giants managing general partner, longtime lead Microsoft attorney Bill Neukom dies at 83",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/former-giants-managing-general-partner-longtime-lead-microsoft-attorney-bill-neukom-dies-at-83-2025-07-17/,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Former San Francisco Giants managing general partner Bill Neukom, a bow-tie loving, longtime Microsoft attorney who was at the helm when the team won its first World Series title in 2010, has died. He was 83. The team announced Neukom's death Thursday. No additional information was provided. Neukom retired from his role following the 2011 season and after the Giants captured the 2010 World Series for their first of three every-other-year titles that included championships in 2012 and 2014. The 2010 victory marked the first for the team since moving West in 1958. “Bill will always hold a special place in our hearts and in the history of this franchise,” Giants CEO Larry Baer said in a statement. “He was instrumental in helping this organization and its players bring the first World Series Championship to San Francisco in 2010. Bill will always be remembered for not only his leadership of this storied organization but also his colorful bow ties and the fact he’d bring a glove to the ballpark to try and catch foul balls. He was a true gentleman, a dedicated fan and a friend to so many.” An avid runner who completed more than a half-dozen marathons, Neukom first joined the ownership group in 1995 and became a general partner in 2003. When Peter Magowan retired after the 2008 season, Neukom became managing general partner. He developed a catchphrase called “The Giants Way” of playing baseball. “My idea is that we adhere to it at the minor-league level and all the way up,"" Neukom said when introduced in October 2008. ""It’s how you play the game, conditioning, fundamentals, a rigorous spring training regimen, everything. We want the best talent, the best teachers, the best leaders, the best trainers, and we want to have better communication on what we want and how we want it done.” After retiring, Neukom remained involved with the Giants as chairman emeritus. He grew up in nearby San Mateo rooting for the Giants and with then-San Francisco Seals owner Charlie Graham as a neighbor. Neukom also loved riding horses and stayed active despite undergoing hip replacement surgery during his Giants tenure. Serving as top counsel for Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates, Neukom was the company's lead lawyer for nearly 25 years. His Microsoft stake was worth an estimated $107 million when he left in 2001. He was a partner in the Seattle office of the law firm Kirkpatrick & Lockhart Preston Gates Ellis. He also was a past president of the American Bar Association, serving in 2007-08. Neukom also founded the World Justice Project in 2006, a multinational, multidisciplinary initiative to strengthen the rule of law worldwide. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

"Union Pacific, Norfolk Southern discuss merger to create transcontinental railroad, AP source says",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/union-pacific-norfolk-southern-discuss-merger-to-create-transcontinental-railroad-ap-source-says-2025-07-17/,"OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern are in merger talks to create the largest railroad in North America that would connect the East and West Coasts. The merger discussions began during the first quarter of this year, according to a person familiar with the talks who isn't authorized to discuss them publicly. It would combine the largest and smallest of the country's six major freight railroads. Both railroads declined to comment. Within the industry there is widespread debate over whether such a merger would be approved by the Surface Transportation Board even though those regulators approved the deal that created CPKC railroad two years ago with the Canadian Pacific's $31 billion acquisition of Kansas City Southern railroad. That merger combined the two smallest major railroads in North America and left only six major freight railroads. But it was the first major rail merger approved in more than two decades. The bar for railroad mergers in the U.S. was raised substantially at the start of the century after a disastrous combination of Union Pacific and Southern Pacific in 1996 that snarled rail traffic for an extended period, followed by the 1999 split of Conrail between Norfolk Southern and CSX, which created backups in the East. To be approved, any major rail merger must show it will enhance competition and serve the public interest under the 2001 rules. The CPKC merger was not judged under those rules because Kansas City Southern had an exemption from them as the smallest major freight railroad at the time. Union Pacific CEO Jim Vena talked earlier this year about the potential benefits of such a merger because it would streamline deliveries all across the country by eliminating the delays that come along with one railroad handing shipments over to another. Plus it would simplify shipping for the companies that rely on railroads to deliver their raw materials and finished products. But in the past, some shippers have raised concerns about the consequences of being left with even fewer options to ship their goods because the major railroads are already so powerful. Some investors have long argued that the industry should eventually consolidate down to two East-West railroads crossing the United States alongside the two railroads that already cross Canada. But regulators have been skeptical and taken a cautious approach. Any proposed deal would face a lengthy STB review. That board is currently evenly split between two Republicans and two Democrats with one seat open. Citi Research analyst Ariel Rosa said in a research note that a major transcontinental railroad merger “would likely prove costly and time consuming, risking a years-long distraction to management, while facing significant pushback from regulators, politicians, employee unions, competitors, customers, and other stakeholders.” Union Pacific, which is based in Omaha, Nebraska, generated $24.3 billion revenue last year as its more than 30.000 employees delivered freight all across the western United States. Norfolk Southern reported $12.1 billion revenue and has roughly 20,000 employees and its headquarters is in Atlanta. Norfolk Southern stock gained 3.7% during the day Thursday and rose another 4.7% to hit $282.50 in after-market trading following the Journal’s story.

"Trump offers regulatory relief for coal, iron ore and chemical industries",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-offers-regulatory-relief-for-coal-iron-ore-and-chemical-industries-2025-07-17/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is granting two years of regulatory relief to coal-fired power plants, chemical manufacturers and other polluting industries as he seeks to reverse Biden-era regulations he considers overly burdensome. Trump issued a series of proclamations late Thursday exempting a range of industries that he calls vital to national security. The proclamations cover coal-fired power plants, taconite iron ore processing facilities used to make steel, and chemical manufacturers that help produce semiconductors and medical device sterilizers. The proclamations allow the facilities to comply with Environmental Protection Agency standards that were in place before rules imposed in recent years by President Joe Biden's administration, the White House said. Trump called the Biden-era rules expensive and, in some cases, unattainable. His actions will ensure that “critical industries can continue to operate uninterrupted to support national security without incurring substantial costs,'' the White House said in a fact sheet. Trump’s EPA had earlier exempted dozens of coal-fired plants from air-pollution rules for the same reasons. The EPA also offered other industrial polluters a chance for exemptions from requirements to reduce emissions of toxic chemicals such as mercury, arsenic and benzene. An electronic mailbox set up by the EPA allowed regulated companies to request a presidential exemption under the Clean Air Act to a host of Biden-era rules. Environmental groups have denounced the offer to grant exemptions, calling the new email address a “polluters’ portal” that could allow hundreds of companies to evade laws meant to protect the environment and public health. Mercury exposure can cause brain damage, especially in children. Fetuses are vulnerable to birth defects via exposure in a mother’s womb. Within weeks of the EPA's offer, industry groups representing hundreds of chemical and petrochemical manufacturers began seeking the blanket exemptions from federal pollution requirements. The Clean Air Act enables the president to temporarily exempt industrial sites from new rules if the technology required to meet them is not widely available and if the continued activity is in the interest of national security. John Walke, clean air director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, said Trump’s claims about technology problems and national security concerns were “pretexts” so he could help big corporations get richer. “President Trump just signed a literal free pass for polluters,″ Walke said. “If your family lives downwind of these plants, this is going to mean more toxic chemicals in the air you breathe.” In April, the EPA granted nearly 70 coal-fired power plants a two-year exemption from federal requirements to reduce emissions of toxic chemicals. A list posted on the agency’s website lists 47 power providers — which operate at least 66 coal-fired plants — that are receiving exemptions from the Biden-era rules. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced plans in March to roll back dozens of key environmental rules on everything from clean air to clean water and climate change. Zeldin called the planned rollbacks the “most consequential day of deregulation in American history."" An Associated Press examination of the proposed rollbacks concluded that rules targeted by the EPA could prevent an estimated 30,000 deaths and save $275 billion each year they are in effect. The AP review included the agency’s own prior assessments as well as a wide range of other research. In a related development, the EPA said Thursday it will give utility companies an additional year to inspect and report on contamination from toxic coal ash landfills across the country. “Today’s actions provide much needed regulatory relief for the power sector and help ... unleash American energy,"" Zeldin said.

Federal Reserve's Waller says central bank should cut rates at next meeting,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/federal-reserves-waller-says-central-bank-should-cut-rates-at-next-meeting-2025-07-17/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A top Federal Reserve official said late Thursday that the central bank should cut its key interest rate later this month, carving out a different view than that of Chair Jerome Powell, who has been harshly criticized by the White House for delaying rate cuts. Christopher Waller, a member of the Fed's governing board, said in a speech in New York City that the economy is showing signs of weakening, with consumer spending slowing and job gains cooling. The Fed should reduce borrowing costs to shore up spending and growth before the job market weakens further, Waller said. “The economy is still growing, but its momentum has slowed significantly,” he said, adding that the slowdown threatens the Fed’s goal of maximum employment. At the same time, President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs are likely to only lift inflation temporarily and aren't a reason to postpone rate cuts, Waller said. “Tariffs have boosted, and will continue to boost, inflation a bit above the (Fed's) 2% objective this year,” Waller said, but policymakers should “look through tariff effects and focus on underlying inflation,” which he said is nearing the 2% goal. Waller has been mentioned as a potential replacement for Powell when the current chair’s term expires in May 2026, or perhaps earlier if Trump takes the unprecedented step of firing Powell. Trump has threatened to fire Powell this year but on Wednesday said it was “highly unlikely” he would take such a step. For his part, Powell has said the Fed wants to see the impact of the duties on prices and the economy before making any moves. Waller, a Trump appointee, has previously said that he would support a rate cut in July. Michelle Bowman, also a Trump appointee, has also spoken in favor of a cut. Minutes to the Fed's June 17-18 meeting said that only “a couple” of the 19 members of the central bank's interest-rate setting committee supported a cut in July. Other participants — the minutes didn't say how many — said that the Fed should keep rates unchanged this year, since inflation remains above 2%. Consumer prices rose 2.7% in June from a year ago, the fastest pace in four months. Other potential replacements for Powell have also publicly expressed support for cutting rates soon, including Kevin Warsh, a former member of the Fed's board who stepped down in 2011. Warsh, currently a fellow at the Hoover Institution, said on Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures” earlier this week that he supported rate cuts. “The president’s right to be frustrated with Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve,” Warsh said.

"After years of tough rules on liquids and footwear, US air travel may be on the cusp of a new era",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/after-years-of-tough-rules-on-liquids-and-footwear-us-air-travel-may-be-on-the-cusp-of-a-new-era-2025-07-17/,"NEW YORK (AP) — When limits on liquids were introduced at TSA checkpoints across the country in 2006, bins overflowed with bottled water, toothpaste, shaving cream and so much more. Nearly two decades later, travelers are much more accustomed to the “3-1-1” regulations"" governing the size of the liquids they're flying with, but scenes of passengers guzzling a beverage before putting their bags through the screening machines are still common. That's why Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem sent ripples through the traveling public when she said earlier this week that changes might be afoot when it comes to the TSA's current liquid limits. “The liquids, I’m questioning. So that may be the next big announcement, is what size your liquids need to be,” Noem told a conference in Washington. Will travelers be able to carry bigger bottles? Multiple 1-quart bags of liquids? Those details haven't been rolled out. But coming on top of her announcement earlier this month that travelers could keep their shoes on at TSA checkpoints, it seems a much different security experience for American air travelers might be emerging. Airline travel changed dramatically after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. Before that, airlines were responsible for security and would often contract it out to private firms, said Henry Harteveldt, an airline industry analyst with Atmosphere Research Group. Travelers often didn't need to show their ID at security checkpoints — and people without boarding passes, such as family members or friends, could go to the gate in some locations. “It was much more casual. And clearly it was ineffective, because 9/11 occurred,” Hartevelt said. That's when the Department of Homeland Security and the Transportation Security Administration were born, with the mandate of preventing more terrorist attacks. The liquid limits, however, didn’t kick in until 2006, after authorities foiled a plot that used liquid explosives smuggled aboard carry-on luggage. The TSA then very briefly banned all liquids in carry-on luggage. That ban lasted about six weeks, but strained airlines’ baggage systems as more and more travelers turned to checked bags to pack toiletries. At the time the 3.4-ounce limit was implemented, the FBI and other laboratories had found that tiny amounts of substances small enough to fit into a quart-size bag couldn’t blow up an airliner. When the ban was eventually lifted in September 2006, consumers and businesses alike had to learn how to adapt to the 3-1-1 rule — leading to more demand for smaller, travel size bottles of anything from shampoo to toothpaste, as well as clear, “TSA approved” toiletry bags that are still seen on store shelves today. The rule was also adopted in many countries around the world starting later that year. Keith Jeffries, a former TSA director at Los Angeles International Airport and now vice president of K2 Security Screening Group, says whatever comes next needs to be clear for passengers. And he knows whereof he speaks. Jeffries was working for TSA in Albuquerque, New Mexico, when the liquids rules came down overnight. Signage had to be changed to let passengers know of the new regulations. Barrels overflowing with toothpaste, shaving cream and shampoo had to be emptied every half hour. Jeffries remembers seeing a pair of shoes sitting in one of the barrels. When he asked why, a TSA staffer said there was gel in the soles. “I said, 'Please tell me I don’t have a passenger back there walking in the sterile area barefoot. And he says, 'No, sir, they still have their socks on,'” he said. “That’s how chaotic it was.” Any move to simplify the screening process and cut down on the time it takes for passengers to navigate checkpoints would be a welcome change for everyone, Harteveldt says. Because it isn’t just about convenience; those lines before the security checkpoints are the most at risk to a potential threat. The fact that the TSA felt confident enough to change its shoe policy earlier this month may not save too much time from an individual traveler’s perspective, Harteveldt notes — but marks a “big step forward” toward cutting down the average length of the security process when you think about the number of people going through U.S. airports each day. Relaxing current liquid restrictions could aid that effort. Still, questions remain. “What we don’t know is what the secretary is going to announce about liquids,” Harteveldt said. “Will they remove the liquid ban altogether — and can we go back to bringing full-sized of toiletries and other items with us? Will they allow people to bring more than one bag of toiletries and liquids? And importantly, will they relax the limit on (the) quart-size bag itself?’” It’s also possible that the changes the TSA makes, whatever they are, only start at a handful of airports that have the technology to do so. Over the years, airports worldwide have adopted some aspects of security screenings faster or differently than others. But travelers could be confused if they’re able to bring a full-size bottle of shampoo or lotion when flying out of one airport, for example, but not on their return trip home. “The devil is going to be in the details,” Harteveldt said. “That’s why the rollout plan will be absolutely critical.” Harveldt says a more streamlined process could make travelers less stressed, but others — including flight attendants and pilots who are in the skies more frequently — may object and question whether airport security is being compromised. Still, Harveldt says he doesn’t believe the TSA would make this change if the agency “didn’t feel it was authentically, truly safe."" If shoe regulations disappear and liquid restrictions are eased, the effects could ripple into the TSA PreCheck program, in which passengers submit information like their fingerprints and the agency prescreens them for any red flags. By giving the agency this information, the traveler then gets some benefits not available to other travelers — a special line to go through and the ability to keep their computers in their bags and their shoes on, for example. But if those benefits become more widely available to all passengers, will fewer people sign up for PreCheck? “What is the impact on now both shoes and liquids going to have on TSA PreCheck enrollment? That is the million-dollar question,"" Jeffries said. “And if I was still with TSA, I would be watching that closely over the next 12 to 18 months.” While the prospect of increasing the current liquid limit could be a welcome change for many U.S. travelers, some experts say that the tech isn’t available in enough airports yet. Current X-ray machines used at most airports today have a difficult time distinguishing between different types of liquids, says Jeffrey Price, a professor of aviation at Metropolitan State University of Denver. That’s key, he explains, in determining whether something is harmless or potentially explosive. While newer computed tomography scanners are better and have begun making their way to airports, Price said in commentary published last week that it could take “another decade or more” before the newer machines are deployed at all U.S. airports. “This is an issue that needs to be studied much more carefully than the policy to leave your shoes on,” he said in an email Thursday. ___ Associated Press editor Elaine Kurtenbach in Bangkok contributed to this report.

"Federal Reserve says building renovation complies with law, defends costs",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/federal-reserve-says-building-renovation-complies-with-law-defends-costs-2025-07-17/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday said the agency's renovation of two of its buildings is in compliance with plans approved by a local commission, disputing a White House suggestion that they may have violated the law by deviating from those plans. The letter is the lastest salvo in an escalating battle between the Federal Reserve, an independent agency charged with fighting inflation and seeking maximum employment, and the Trump administration. President Donald Trump has for months criticized Powell and the Fed for not lowering its key interest rate, which the president says would boost borrowing and accelerate the economy. Powell has said he wants to see how the economy responds to Trump’s sweeping tariffs, which could raise inflation and slow growth, before making any moves. Trump has even threatened to fire Powell, though he has since backed away and said Wednesday it was “highly unlikely” that he would take the unprecedented step of doing so. Firing the Fed chair could cause chaos in the financial markets. Several executives of Wall Street banks have said this week that the Fed's independence from day-to-day politics is crucial. Still, the Trump administration has seized on ballooning costs for the Fed's renovation of two century-old buildings to argue that Powell has mismanaged the project. The president can't fire the Fed chair because of a policy disagreement, but he could do so “for cause,” which is widely seen as some kind of malfeasance or neglect. Last week, the president's top budget adviser, Russell Vought, wrote Powell a letter that said Trump is “extremely troubled” by Powell's management of the project, which has risen in cost to about $2.5 billion, up from the Fed's initial estimate of $1.9 billion. Vought's letter also noted that Powell, in testimony before the Senate last month, said that the Fed removed some amenities that critics called ostentatious from its plans. Those plans had been approved by the National Capital Planning Commission in 2021. Vought said in his letter that if the renovation plans had changed, they were no longer “in compliance with the approved plan"" and may violate the National Capital Planning Act. Powell responded Thursday that since the Fed’s plans were approved by the NCPC in September 2021, it has made only “a small number of design changes to scale back or eliminate certain elements” and added that the changes weren’t significant enough to “warrant... further review.” “The project is proceeding in accordance with the plan that the NCPC approved,” Powell wrote. The changes were intended “to simplify construction and reduce the likelihood of further delays and cost increases,” Powell said in his letter. Powell also defended the cost of the renovation: “Both buildings were in need of significant structural repairs,” including “the removal of asbestos and lead contamination,” as well as the “complete replacement of antiquated systems such as electrical, plumbing, heating, ventilation and air conditioning, as well as fire detection and suppression systems,” he wrote.

OpenAI's advisory board calls for continued and strengthened nonprofit oversight,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/openais-advisory-board-calls-for-continued-and-strengthened-nonprofit-oversight-2025-07-17/,"OpenAI should continue to be controlled by a nonprofit because the artificial intelligence technology it is developing is “too consequential” to be governed by a corporation alone. That is the message from an advisory board convened by OpenAI to give it recommendations about its nonprofit structure — delivered in a report released Thursday, along with a sweeping vision for democratizing AI and reforming philanthropy. “We think it’s too important to entrust to any one sector, the private sector or even the government sector,” said Daniel Zingale, the convener of OpenAI’s nonprofit commission and a former adviser to three California governors. “The nonprofit model allows for what we call a common sector,” that facilitates democratic participation. The recommendations are not binding on OpenAI, but the advisory commission, which includes the labor organizer Dolores Huerta, offers a framework that may be used to judge OpenAI in the future, whether or not they adopt it. In the commission's view, communities that are already feeling the impacts of AI technologies should have input on how they are developed, including how data about them is used. But there are currently few avenues for people to influence tech companies who control much of the development of AI. OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, started in 2015 as a nonprofit research laboratory and has since incorporated a for-profit company with a valuation that has grown to $300 billion. The company has tried to change its structure since the nonprofit board ousted its CEO Sam Altman in Nov. 2023. He was reinstated days later and continues to lead OpenAI. It has run into hurdles escaping its nonprofit roots, including scrutiny from the attorney generals in California and Delaware, who have oversight of nonprofits, and a lawsuit by Elon Musk, an early donor to and founder of OpenAI. Most recently, OpenAI has said it will turn its for-profit company into a public benefit corporation, which must balance the interests of shareholders and its mission. Its nonprofit will hold shares in that new corporation, but OpenAI has not said how much. Zingale said Huerta told the commission their challenge was to help make sure AI is a blessing and not a curse. To grapple with those stakes, they envision a nonprofit with an expansive mandate to help everyone participate in the development and trajectory of AI. “The measure of this nonprofit will be in what it builds, who it includes, and how faithfully it endures to mission and impact,"" they wrote. The commission toured California communities and solicited feedback online. They heard that many were inspired by OpenAI’s mission to create artificial intelligence to benefit humanity and ensure those benefits are felt widely and evenly. But, Zingale said many people feel they are in the dark about how it’s happening. “They know this is profoundly important what’s happening in this ‘Age of Intelligence,’ but they want to understand better what it is, how it’s developed, where are the important choices being made and who’s making them?” he said. Zingale said the commission chose early on not to interact with Altman in any way in order to maintain their independence, though they quote him in their report. However, they did speak with the company’s senior engineers, who they said, “entered our space with humility, seriousness, and a genuine desire to understand how their work might translate into democratic legitimacy.” The commission proposed OpenAI immediately provide significant resources to the nonprofit for use in the public interest. For context, the nonprofit reported $23 million in assets in 2023, the most recent year that its tax filing is available. The commission recommend focusing on closing gaps in economic opportunity, investing in AI literacy and creating an organization that is accessible to and governed by everyday people. “For OpenAI’s nonprofit to fulfill its mandate, it should commit to more than just doing good - it should commit to being known, seen, and shaped by the people it claims to serve,” they wrote. The commission suggested opening a rapid response fund to help reduce economic strains now. Zingale said they specifically recommended funding theater, art and health. “We're trying to make the point that they need to dedicate some of their resources to human to human activities,” he said. The commission also recommended setting up a requirement that a human lead the nonprofit, which Zingale said is a serious recommendation and “a sign of the times."" ___ Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

8 bands divided by lawsuits: It's not just Jane's Addiction,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/8-bands-divided-by-lawsuits-its-not-just-janes-addiction-2025-07-17/,"Bands behaving badly? It's only rock ’n’ roll. Members of alternative rock band Jane’s Addiction filed dueling lawsuits Wednesday over singer Perry Farrell’s onstage scuffle with guitarist Dave Navarro at a Boston concert last year, a fracas that prompted the cancellation of the rest of their reunion tour and a planned album. They join a long and storied tradition of bandmates suing one another, taking interpersonal and legal troubles from the recording studio to the courtroom. Here’s a look at a few very famous cases. WHAT HAPPENED: Navarro, drummer Stephen Perkins and bassist Eric Avery sued Farrell in Los Angeles Superior Court seeking at least $10 million, alleging that Farrell’s behavior on their recent tour had ranged from erratic to out of control, culminating in an assault where Farrell punched Navarro both onstage and backstage. HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: It hasn't been; it's just getting started. Farrell and his wife, Etty Lau Farrell, sued the three bandmates in the same court Wednesday, blaming them for the conflict and the violence. WHAT HAPPENED: How much time do you have? The late, great Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys’ leader, feuded with his cousin and bandmate Mike Love over songwriting credits dating back decades. Love had sued Wilson several times, beginning in the 1990s. HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: Wilson often wasn't the victor — except in 2007, when U.S. District Judge Audrey Collins threw out one of Love's lawsuits against Wilson. In it, Love alleged that a free, 2004 promotional CD of re-recorded Beach Boys songs cost him millions of dollars and violated Love and Wilson’s partnership. WHAT HAPPENED: The sibling rivalry between Oasis brothers Liam and Noel Gallagher is well established. Their brawls not only led to the band’s dissolution in 2009, before their 2025 reunion, but also a legal upset. In 2011, Liam sued Noel for saying Liam’s hangover caused the cancellation of a 2009 festival performance. He said in a statement that the lawsuit was not about money, but that he wanted an apology and for Oasis fans “to know the truth” — that laryngitis prevented him from performing. HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: The lawsuit was dropped. WHAT HAPPENED: The post-breakup decades of Creedence Clearwater Revival were marked by so much legal and personal infighting that you might think CCR stands for Conflict, Clash, Repeat. In 1996, singer-songwriter-guitarist John Fogerty sued ex-bandmates Doug Clifford and Stu Cook for performing under the name Creedence Clearwater Revisited. That case settled in 2001, but the bandmates sued Fogerty in 2014, alleging he was violating the settlement by continuing to publicly slag off the Revisited name. And they said Fogerty himself was now illegally using Creedence Clearwater Revival in concert advertising. Fogerty sued back in 2015, saying Cook and Clifford weren’t paying him proper songwriting royalties for their performances. HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: A federal court merged the two cases, and the resulting hybrid was settled under confidential terms in 2017. WHAT HAPPENED: Fleetwood Mac and feuds are practically synonymous. Breakups and divorces between members are essential to some of their best songs. The conflict resumed in the 2010s when the band kicked lead guitarist Lindsey Buckingham off their 2018 tour, and he sued. Buckingham claimed he was told five days after the group appeared at Radio City Music Hall that January that the band would tour without him. He says he would have been paid at least $12 million for his share of the proceeds. HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: Later that year, Buckingham said they had settled the lawsuit. WHAT HAPPENED: At some point, two key members of Journey stopped believin' in each other. And all over an Amex. Longtime guitarist Neal Schon sued longtime keyboardist Jonathan Cain in 2022, saying Cain was refusing to let him use the band's American Express card. A counterclaim came from Cain, who said that Schon was running up enormous personal charges on the band's account. HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: A judge in 2024 appointed a custodian over the band's financial decisions, specifically empowered to settle disagreements between Schon and Cain. WHAT HAPPENED: In 2023, Daryl Hall sued his longtime music partner John Oates, arguing that Oates' plan to sell off his share of a joint venture would violate the terms of a business agreement the Hall & Oates duo had forged long before. The move quickly prompted a judge to temporarily block the sale. HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: The lawsuit and arbitration are ongoing. WHAT HAPPENED: Their artistic partnership had been over for months, but the Beatles had to break out the barristers to break up their business. Paul McCartney went to London’s High Court of Justice in 1970 to dissolve the Fab Four's 1967 contractual partnership, which included the Apple record label. McCartney above all wanted to get rid of manager Allen Klein, whom John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr wanted to keep as overseer of their business. “The only way for me to save The Beatles and Apple,” McCartney told British GQ in 2020, “was to sue the band.” HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: The court ruled in McCartney's favor and appointed a receiver to oversee their ventures in 1971. But negotiations and wrangling continued until a long-term solution that would become known as “The Beatles Agreement” was signed by all four members in 1974.

The Market Rally Is Gaining Momentum—Don’t Get Left Behind,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/the-market-rally-is-gaining-momentumdont-get-left-behind/,"It’s taken a year since the signal for a broadening stock market rally was given for it to arrive, but it's finally here. The signal, falling inflation and the first FOMC rate reductions in years, was followed by several quarters of uncertainty compounded by tariffs and macroeconomic headwinds. The story in early July is that tariffs are impacting economic conditions less than feared, conditions remain resilient, and tailwinds may soon begin to blow. Tailwinds in the form of trade deals and macroeconomic stability will be compounded by Trump’s tax and deregulation policy, potentially leading to years of economic expansion for all sectors. Tech and Communications Services remain in the lead among S&P 500 NYSEARCA: SPY sectors, with NVIDIA NASDAQ: NVDA as the leading player. However, even its bullish outlook and rapidly improving share price indicate the rally is broadening. That lies in the trading volume, which remains healthy at around one billion shares traded weekly, but is noticeably reduced from the peak of the AI craze, even accounting for the stock split. Where the volume is flowing to is telling, as it includes sectors such as the Industrials and Financials.  The industrial sector is the standout, as represented by the Industrial Sector SPDR NYSEARCA: XLI, which broke new highs earlier this year. It is up nearly 5% from the previous high, indicating a solid movement and a high level of market conviction. Leading stocks include defense names and machinery and equipment makers such as Caterpillar and Deere, which are at or near fresh highs as of mid-July. Defense stocks, notably, are supported by global military activity, rearmament, and modernization, with U.S. spending expected to increase by double digits next year.  The Financial Sector has already reported for Q2, with only a few regional and smaller banks left to report. The takeaway is that business is better than expected, with strengths in all segments amplified by higher interest rates and net interest income. Segmentally, the financials indicate that the consumer is stable, commercial activity remains solid, and trading is performing better than forecast. The Financial Sector SPDR NYSEARCA: XLF broke new highs in early July and is poised to move higher in the second half of 2025.  JPMorgan’s guidance is the critical detail as it includes better-than-expected results, ample cash flow, and increasing capital returns. JPMorgan, the largest financial institution outside of China, has increased its dividend distribution twice in the last four quarters and is on track for another increase in two quarters. That is a substantial enticement for investors and a driving force for its stock price, which pulled back in early July but confirmed support at the 30-day moving average following the release. Volume is not aggressively high in this stock, but it is at the high end of the three-month range, with the converging MACD reflecting improving strength. Other S&P 500 sectors have yet to set new highs, but one sector is on track to retest its new highs soon. That is the Consumer Staples sector, represented by the Consumer Discretionary SPDR NYSEARCA: XLY, which is up 25% from its April lows and appears poised to move higher as of mid-July. Earnings, which tend to be released near the end of the reporting cycle, could catalyze the move higher, but an earlier catalyst is also a possibility. The latest Retail Sales report reveals stronger-than-expected consumer activity, aligning with healthy labor market conditions. The healthy labor market conditions are evident in the July initial claims figures, which are trending in line with seasonal patterns at healthy levels.

High-Flying GE Aerospace Drops After Blowout Q2 — What Now?,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/high-flying-ge-aerospace-drops-after-blowout-q2-what-now/,"Earnings results are in for GE Aerospace NYSE: GE, and the General Electric spin-off had a great quarter. GE Aerospace has been one of the best-performing large-cap U.S. stocks in the market in 2025. Its total return north of 56% as of the July 17 close ranks in the top 10 among S&P 500 stocks. Its strong quarterly performance continues to validate the bullish momentum behind the stock. Let’s dive into the aerospace and defense company’s latest results and analyze the outlook for the stock going forward. In Q2, GE Aerospace posted adjusted revenue of $10.2 billion, which marked a 23% increase from a year ago. This massively beat out consensus expectations. The company’s adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.66 showed an increase of over 38% compared to Q2 2024. This result exceeded expectations of 19% earnings growth. Adding to the strong performance was the fact that GE Aerospace raised its guidance for 2025 and the long term. The company anticipates adjusted revenue growth in the mid-teens in 2025, up from its previous low-double digits estimate. It now expects midpoint adjusted EPS of $5.70, compared to around $5.28 previously. Analysts expected the company to raise its guidance, but the new EPS midpoint was still higher than anticipated. Through 2028, the company now expects adjusted revenue to rise at a double-digit compound annual growth rate (CAGR). It previously forecasted a high-single-digit adjusted revenue CAGR through 2028. Still, with all this good news, shares dropped moderately on the day of the July 17 release. So, what gives? As noted before, analysts had already significantly raised their guidance expectations on the stock. This made the firm’s huge beat less consequential than it would have been otherwise. The huge 48% rise in shares since GE Aerospace last reported earnings demonstrates the company's increasing expectations. Markets generally expected GE to report very strong results, as the company announced a plethora of new order agreements in May and June. This helped push shares up before GE reported. Analysts at both Citigroup and the Royal Bank of Canada substantially increased their price targets on GE Aerospace prior to the results, another sign of this anticipation. GE Aerospace received further good news in the days prior to releasing earnings. The preliminary report into the Air India crash issued no recommendations to GE Aerospace, which made the plane’s engines, or Boeing NYSE: BA. While the analysis is still ongoing, investigators have not assigned blame to either firm at this point. GE Aerospace shares gained for several days after the report, making it that much harder for the stock to rise on earnings. GE Aerospace is clearly a very well-positioned company, seeing robust sales and earnings growth. It has a fantastic moat, with three out of every four commercial flights using GE engines. This gives the firm a massive installed base, allowing it to generate servicing revenues on those engines for years after they are initially delivered. This is why 70% of the company’s revenue last quarter came from servicing. However, this does not necessarily mean the stock represents a great investment at current prices. As of the July 17 close, GE Aerospace trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of just under 46x. That’s just moderately lower than the 50x high it reached in April 2023 since GE’s restructuring in January 2023. The 46x figure is also 21% above the stock’s average forward P/E of 38x since the restructuring. Still, the 46x figure could come down as analysts push their EPS estimates higher after the results. One part of GE Aerospace's business that could drive upside going forward is its Defense and Propulsion Technologies (DPT) segment. The company is teaming up with Kratos Defense and Security Solutions NASDAQ: KTOS to make propulsion systems for affordable unmanned aerial systems. That's short for drone fighter jets. This type of technology has the potential to see big-time adoption in the defense industry over the long term. GE Aerospace’s dominant market position allows it to get in on emerging technologies like this. Its ability to participate in these types of innovations sets the stock up to continue performing well in the long term. However, its high valuation and lackluster reaction to strong earnings indicate that there may be limits to the stock’s near-term upside potential.

Beef prices have soared in the US — and not just during grilling season,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/beef-prices-have-soared-in-the-us--and-not-just-during-grilling-season-2025-07-17/,"OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Anyone firing up the grill this summer already knows hamburger patties and steaks are expensive, but the latest numbers show prices have climbed to record highs. And experts say consumers shouldn't expect much relief soon either. The average price of a pound of ground beef rose to $6.12 in June, up nearly 12% from a year ago, according to U.S. government data. The average price of all uncooked beef steaks rose 8% to $11.49 per pound. But this is not a recent phenomenon. Beef prices have been steadily rising over the past 20 years because the supply of cattle remains tight while beef remains popular. In fact, the U.S. cattle herd has been steadily shrinking for decades. As of Jan. 1, the U.S. had 86.7 million cattle and calves, down 8% from the most recent peak in 2019. That is the lowest number of cattle since 1951, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Many factors including drought and cattle prices have contributed to that decline. And now the emergence of a pesky parasite in Mexico and the prospect of widespread tariffs may further reduce supply and raise prices. Here's a look at what's causing the price of beef to rise. The American beef industry has gotten better at breeding larger animals, so ranchers can provide the same amount of beef with fewer cattle, said David Anderson, a livestock economist at Texas A&M. Then in 2020, a three-year drought began that dried out pastures and raised the cost of feed for cattle, according to the American Farm Bureau. Drought has continued to be a problem across the West since then, and the price of feed has put more pressure on ranchers who already operate on slim profit margins. In response, many farmers slaughtered more female cattle than usual, which helped beef supplies in the short term but lowered the size of future herds. Lower cattle supplies has raised prices. In recent years cattle prices have soared, so that now animals are selling for thousands of dollars apiece. Recent prices show cattle selling for more than $230 per hundredweight, or hundred pounds. Those higher prices give ranchers more incentive to sell cows now to capture profits instead of hanging onto them for breeding given that prices in the years ahead may decrease, Anderson said. “For them, the balance is, ‘Do I sell that animal now and take this record high check?’ Or ‘do I keep her to realize her returns over her productive life when she’s having calves?’” Anderson said. “And so it’s this balancing act and so far the side that’s been winning is to sell her and get the check.” The emergence of a flesh-eating pest in cattle herds in Mexico has put extra pressure on supply because officials cut off all imports of cattle from south of the border last year. Some 4% of the cattle the U.S. feeds to slaughter for beef comes from Mexico. The pest is the New World screwworm fly, and female flies lay eggs in wounds on warm-blooded animals. The larvae that hatch are unusual among flies for feeding on live flesh and fluids instead of dead material. American officials worry that if the fly reaches Texas, its flesh-eating maggots could cause large economic losses as they did decades ago before the U.S. eradicated the pest. Agricultural economist Bernt Nelson with the Farm Bureau said the loss of that many cattle is putting additional pressure on supply that is helping drive prices higher. President Donald Trump's tariffs have yet to have a major impact on beef prices but they could be another factor that drives prices higher because the U.S. imports more than 4 million pounds of beef every year. Much of what is imported is lean beef trimmings that meatpackers mix with fattier beef produced in the U.S. to produce the varieties of ground beef that domestic consumers want. Much of that lean beef comes from Australia and New Zealand that have only seen a 10% tariff, but some of it comes from Brazil where Trump has threatened tariffs as high as 50%. If the tariffs remain in place long-term, meat processors will have to pay higher prices on imported lean beef. It wouldn't be easy for U.S. producers to replace because the country's system is geared toward producing fattier beef known for marbled steaks. It's the height of grilling season and demand in the U.S. for beef remains strong, which Kansas State agricultural economist Glynn Tonsor said will help keep prices higher. If prices remain this high, shoppers will likely start to buy more hamburger meat and fewer steaks, but that doesn't appear to be happening broadly yet — and people also don't seem to be buying chicken or pork instead of beef. Nelson said that recently the drought has eased — allowing pasture conditions to improve — and grain prices are down thanks to the drop in export demand for corn because of the tariffs. Those factors, combined with the high cattle prices might persuade more ranchers to keep their cows and breed them to expand the size of their herds. Even if ranchers decided to raise more cattle to help replace those imports, it would take at least two years to breed and raise them. And it wouldn't be clear if that is happening until later this fall when ranchers typically make those decisions. “We’ve still got a lot of barriers in the way to grow this herd,” Nelson said. Just consider that a young farmer who wants to add 25 bred heifers to his herd has to be prepared to spend more than $100,000 at auction at a time when borrowing costs remain high. There is typically a seasonal decline in beef prices as grilling season slows down into the fall, but those price declines are likely to be modest. ___ Associated Press writer Dee-Ann Durbin contributed to this report from Detroit.

Netflix delivers another strong performance in second quarter while following a familiar script,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/netflix-delivers-another-strong-performance-in-second-quarter-while-following-a-familiar-script-2025-07-17/,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Netflix on Thursday announced another quarter of steady growth as the video streaming service's more than 300 million subscribers have become increasingly attractive to advertisers. It’s a familiar script that Netflix has followed for the past three years to widen its lead in video streaming while delivering financial results that have usually easily exceeded the analyst projections that steer investors. While Netflix's profit eclipsed Wall Street’s expectations by a wide margin in the April-June quarter, its revenue came in right around the bar set by analysts. The Los Gatos, California, company earned $3.1 billion, or $7.19 per share, a 46% increase from the same time last year. Revenue rose 16% to $11.08 billion. Management also slightly raised its revenue forecast for the entire year, citing a belief that its programming lineup will reel in more subscribers in the second half than the first. “We’re really incredibly excited about the back half of this year and confident that it keeps rolling in '26,” Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos told analysts during a Thursday video conference. Although he believes Netflix remains “perfectly positioned to keep thriving,” Investing.com analyst Thomas Monteiro said investors were disappointed that the company didn't boost its full-year guidance for revenue and its profit margins by even more against the backdrop of its accelerating momentum. Netflix’s shares slipped 1% in extended trading, indicating investors expected an even more robust performance. But that is a minor stumble, given Netflix's stock price has soared 43% this year. The stock's strong run began during the second half of 2022 when the company introduced a low-priced version of its service with commercial interruptions as an antidote to an abrupt downturn in subscribers. The video streaming service is also faring well in Hollywood, as evidenced by the 120 Emmy nominations showered upon its programs earlier this week – second only to Warner Bros. Discovery’s HBO Max. In the past quarter, Netflix hailed “Sirens,” “Ginny & Georgia” and “The Four Seasons” as being among its most watched programming. The popularity of Netflix’s scripted programming combined with weekly World Wrestling Entertainment spectacles, high-profile boxing matches and periodic National Football League games have enabled its service to retain subscribers while its prices rise, including on the cheapest tier. Netflix stopped providing quarterly updates on its total subscribers at the beginning of this year, but the company’s revenue growth leaves no doubt that the number has grown from the 302 million reported at the end of 2024. It’s gradually turning into an advertising magnet, too. Although Netflix still isn’t selling enough commercials to require a disclosure of its advertising revenue, management continues to highlight the growth in its results. Netflix said its ad revenue for this year is on pace to double from last year. Unlike most major tech companies, Netflix has had the benefit of peddling a service that so far has avoided being whipsawed by President Donald Trump’s fluctuating trade war. But Trump has threatened to introduce tariffs on entertainment made outside the U.S., a move that could hit Netflix especially hard because of its global reach. In an apparent olive branch for the president, Netflix made the unusual move of citing its commitment to the U.S. in its quarterly shareholder letter. The company disclosed that it had invested an estimated $125 billion in the U.S. from 2020-2024 and cited sound stages and production facilities in New Mexico and New Jersey as examples of its ongoing expansion in its home country.

Why Prologis May Be the Smartest Backdoor Bet on AI Real Estate,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/why-prologis-may-be-the-smartest-backdoor-bet-on-ai-real-estate/,"Prologis Inc. NYSE: PLD has taken investors on an unwelcome round trip since it reported earnings on July 16. PLD stock initially jumped 4% after the real estate investment trust (REIT) reported. However, in less than 24 hours, the stock has given up those gains and more. As of midday trading on July 17, PLD stock is down 1.3% from its closing price on July 15. This could be an example of investors shifting back to technology stocks as the AI trade recovers. However, that rotation into the AI trade is exactly why investors may want to look closely at Prologis. The industrial REIT is leaning into the data center arena. Its broad portfolio exposes investors to this long-term trend without paying the premium for dedicated data center REITs like the category leader Equinix Inc. NASDAQ: EQIX, which trades at 80x earnings. Prologis's value comes from its positioning within the data center category. Many hyperscalers, such as Amazon.com Inc. NASDAQ: AMZN and Meta Platforms Inc. NASDAQ: META, want to build custom data centers. However, they need zoned and permitted land near scarce power infrastructure. This type of land is becoming increasingly rare and is worth a premium price to the right company. That’s precisely where Prologis steps in. The company offers nearly 1.2 billion square feet of industrial space, often near major metropolitan areas with constrained power grids. These “powered shells” provide real estate and grid access without the need to manage the server-side operations. Offering the shells without being a full-service operator is an area where Prologis is beginning to capture market share. The benefit for Prologis and investors is that the company doesn’t have to absorb the full capital expense or complex operational details that come with data centers. Prologis’ earnings report was solid but not spectacular. The company's topline revenue of $2.03 billion was in line with expectations and a shade above the $2.01 billion it reported in the prior year. The bottom line was stronger with the company delivering earnings per share (EPS) of $1.46, which was 5 cents above the $1.41 forecast. It was also 52% higher year-over-year (YOY). The strong earnings point to the company’s growing funds from operations (FFO) that came in at $1.32, beating forecasts and higher YOY. Importantly, Prologis reaffirmed its full-year FFO guidance for $5.27 to $5.31 FFO per share on expectations of demand resilience, signaling continued confidence in industrial and digital demand trends. The company’s net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 4.1x puts it in a stronger position than many REIT peers to invest in strategic growth, such as AI infrastructure and data center-adjacent real estate, without overleveraging or sacrificing its dividend. On July 13, Wells Fargo & Co. NYSE: WFC gave PLD stock an Overweight rating with a price target of $137. That’s above the stock’s consensus price target of $120.47, a 12.2% gain. When combined with a dividend that currently yields 3.76% investors can get a total return that’s higher than the stock’s 5-year average. Plus, at 27x earnings, the stock trades at a discount to its historical averages. However, what analysts say after earnings could impact the short-term direction of the stock. After hitting a 52-week low in April, PLD stock has entered a healthy consolidation pattern, trading between $105 and $110 since early June. The MACD remains in bullish territory, and price action is coiling above its 50-period SMA, suggesting accumulation, not distribution. Should the stock break above the $110 resistance, it could confirm a trend reversal.  Before you consider Prologis, you'll want to hear this.

A New $70 Billion AI Investment Could Push Taiwan Semiconductor,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/a-new-70-billion-ai-investment-could-push-taiwan-semiconductor/,"There have been a few times in the stock market when investors received a clear signal, as they do right now, with a focus on the technology sector amid a race for artificial intelligence dominance and a broader market share for the United States. As trade tariffs begin to create more uncertainty and rivalry with countries like China, onshoring the manufacturing and supply capacity of chips and semiconductors has become a top priority. This is why President Trump has decided to add a new $70 billion bill to help boost artificial intelligence production and overall onshoring. This new bill, however, will likely benefit those names in the space that already have a significant presence in the United States, as well as those who have demonstrated an aligned interest in what the administration is trying to accomplish with these strategic investments. That is exactly where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing NYSE: TSM comes into play, as one of the names that fits this description and is likely to benefit from this bill overall. As an investor favorite, this stock still has significant upside potential compared to its peers in the same space, as valuation metrics currently diverge from the bullish factors that are expanding beneath the surface for this company. There must be a good reason why markets are willing to bid the price of Taiwan Semiconductor higher and higher, as the company delivered a rally of up to 62.6% over the past quarter alone. Considering that markets are forward-looking, the current price action and the stock's new 52-week high are signs of things to come. This pricing behavior may consider the potential effects of the new $70 billion bill on the industry and Taiwan Semiconductor stock specifically. Beyond this price action, other fundamental developments are underway within the company and its stock. One of these factors is the recent boost in valuations coming from Wall Street analysts, such as Charles Shi from Needham & Company. This analyst’s take for July 2025 is a Buy rating for Taiwan Semiconductor stock, accompanied by a valuation target of up to $270 per share. That view now calls for the stock to make a new 52-week high. This breakout will likely boost sentiment in the stock further and potentially attract new institutional buyers who employ momentum strategies on such breakouts. This call also implies that the stock can deliver an additional upside potential of as much as 10% from its current trading price, although it will likely meet or exceed these expectations. Analysts aren’t the only ones willing to admit that the setup in Taiwan Semiconductor stock significantly favors buyers over sellers. Short sellers themselves decided to close their positions over the past month. Up to 22.2% of Taiwan Semiconductor’s short interest was wiped out as higher prices were made, forcing bears to close their positions. As the stock continues to break out and broader industry themes align, creating further upside potential for the company, investors shouldn’t be surprised to see some new institutional buyers knocking on the door, willing to buy more of the stock. As of early July 2025, allocators from PineStone Asset Management decided to boost their holdings in Taiwan Semiconductor stock by 3.5%. While this doesn’t sound like much on a percentage basis, in dollar terms, this new addition has brought the group’s net position to a high of $1.6 billion today. The reason these institutions decided to buy could be mainly attributed to the broader effects of this $70 billion bill. However, there is another fundamental factor that also stands to benefit Taiwan Semiconductor stock. Compared to peers like NVIDIA Co. NASDAQ: NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. NASDAQ: AMD, valuation multiples speak volumes. Even though Taiwan Semiconductor stock is now trading at a new all-time high, its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio still stands below that of its peers. This means that a valuation “catch-up” play could be had in the coming months, perhaps another driving factor behind the institutional buying. One last, unorthodox check an investor can do on Taiwan Semiconductor stock is to examine what those with their finger on the pulse of what Washington is doing have decided to buy for themselves. As it turns out, Cleo Fields, a congress member, decided to buy as much as $250,000 worth of Taiwan Semiconductor stock as of late June 2025. This decision was made suspiciously close to President Trump's $70 billion investment announcement, leading investors to the conclusion that this company's future is indeed brighter and filled with more upside.

The Trade Desk's S&P 500 Entry: Ad-Tech Stock as a Core Holding?,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/the-trade-desks-s-and-p-500-entry-ad-tech-stock-as-a-core-holding/,"Digital advertising leader, The Trade Desk NASDAQ: TTD, recently saw its stock price and trading activity surge. The driver behind this market excitement is a major corporate milestone: The company is set to join the prestigious S&P 500 index, effective before the market opens on July 18, 2025. This promotion to the big leagues clearly signals the company's scale and importance. For investors, it raises a key question: Is this recent rally just a temporary spike on news, or does it signal a new, sustainable phase of growth? Joining the S&P 500 provides a powerful and immediate tailwind for a stock. The reason is simple and mechanical. Trillions of dollars are invested in passive index funds and ETFs designed to track the companies in the S&P 500 closely. When The Trade Desk is officially added, the managers of these massive funds are required to buy its shares to keep their funds in balance. This creates a wave of automatic buying that is not based on opinion or market sentiment. The impact has been clear. The stock's daily trading volume has jumped from an average of about 6.6 million shares to over 43 million. At the same time, short interest has collapsed as bearish traders close their positions. This event provides a strong foundation of support for the stock by securing a new, broad base of institutional investors. The S&P 500 inclusion directly results from The Trade Desk's success. The company's underlying business is strong, built on several key advantages that support a long-term bullish outlook. Investors often point to The Trade Desk's high valuation as a cautionary tale. While the stock's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) is high, reflecting lofty market expectations, Trade Desk’s financial results provide strong support for this premium. In the first quarter of 2025, it reported revenue of $616 million, a 25% increase from the prior year, with a substantial adjusted EBITDA margin of 34%. Its business is also incredibly durable, boasting a customer retention rate of over 95% for more than a decade. The company's forecast for the second quarter anticipates revenue of at least $682 million, demonstrating confidence that this momentum will continue. It is also essential to consider recent insider selling in the proper context. Recent stock sales by executives have been made primarily under pre-arranged Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. This is a standard and routine method for insiders to manage their personal finances and tax obligations, not necessarily a signal about their confidence in the company's future. The Trade Desk presents a unique investment opportunity. The powerful combination of a near-term technical event and robust long-term growth continues to drive the stock upward. The required buying from index funds provides a new, solid floor of institutional support for the stock. Meanwhile, the company's leadership in the unstoppable shift to digital and Connected TV advertising provides the engine for continued growth. While investors should always consider a stock's valuation, The Trade Desk’s proven performance and strategic position strongly support its place as a core technology holding.

"Interior Secretary Burgum must personally approve all wind and solar projects, a new order says",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-administration-order-requires-interior-secretary-to-sign-off-on-all-wind-and-solar-projects-2025-07-17/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — All solar and wind energy projects on federal lands and waters must be personally approved by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum under a new order that authorizes him to conduct “elevated review” of activities ranging from leases to rights of way, construction and operational plans, grants and biological opinions. The enhanced oversight on clean-energy projects is aimed at “ending preferential treatment for unreliable, subsidy-dependent wind and solar energy,"" the Interior Department said in a statement Thursday. The order ""will ensure all evaluations are thorough and deliberative"" on potential projects on millions of acres of federal lands and offshore areas, the department said. Clean-energy advocates said the action could hamstring projects that need to be underway quickly to qualify for federal tax credits that are set to expire under the tax-cut and spending bill that President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4. The law phases out credits for wind, solar and other renewable energy while enhancing federal support for fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas. “At a time when energy demand is skyrocketing, adding more layers of bureaucracy and red tape for energy projects at the Interior Department is exactly the wrong approach,'' said Stephanie Bosh, senior vice president of the Solar Energy Industries Association. “There’s no question this directive is going to make it harder to maintain our global (artificial intelligence) leadership and achieve energy independence here at home.'' In the legislation, Trump and GOP lawmakers moved to dismantle the 2022 climate law passed by Democrats under President Joe Biden. And on July 7, Trump signed an executive order that further restricts subsidies for what he called “expensive and unreliable energy policies from the Green New Scam.” That order was part of a deal the Republican president made with conservative House Republicans who were unhappy that the tax-cut bill did not immediately end all subsidies for clean energy. A group of Republican senators, including Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Utah Sen. John Curtis, had pushed to delay phaseout of some of the credits to allow currently planned projects to continue. Trump has long expressed disdain for wind power, describing it at a Cabinet meeting last week as an expensive form of energy that “smart” countries do not use. Even with the changes approved by the Senate, the new law will likely crush growth in the wind and solar industry and lead to a spike in Americans’ utility bills, Democrats and environmental groups say. The law jeopardizes hundreds of renewable energy projects intended to boost the nation’s electric grid as demand is set to rise amid sharp growth from data centers, artificial intelligence and other uses, they said. ""This isn’t oversight. It’s obstruction that will needlessly harm the fastest growing sources of electric power,'' said Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, an industry group. He called the move “particularly confounding” as lawmakers in both parties seek to streamline permitting for all sources of American energy. The Interior Department said Thursday that Burgum’s order will “level the playing field for dispatchable, cost-effective and secure energy sources,” such as coal and natural gas “after years of assault under the previous administration.″ “American energy dominance is driven by U.S.-based production of reliable baseload energy, not regulatory favoritism towards unreliable energy projects that are solely dependent on taxpayer subsidies and foreign-sourced equipment,” said Adam Suess, the acting assistant secretary for lands and minerals management. While Democrats complain the tax law will make it harder to get renewable energy to the electric grid, Republicans say it supports production of traditional energy sources such as oil, gas and coal, as well as nuclear power, increasing reliability. In the Senate compromise, wind and solar projects that begin construction within a year of the law’s enactment are allowed to get a full tax credit without a deadline for when the projects are “placed in service,″ or plugged into the grid. Wind and solar projects that begin later must be placed in service by the end of 2027 to get a credit. The law retains incentives for technologies such as advanced nuclear, geothermal and hydropower through 2032. About 10% of new solar power capacity under development is on federal lands, said Sylvia Leyva Martínez, a principal analyst at the Wood Mackenzie research firm. Those projects could be delayed or canceled if Burgum does not issue permits for them, she said. Related projects such as transmission lines could be affected, too, she said. While only about 1% of the combined capacity of pending wind projects are on federal lands, delays could affect nearby infrastructure that supports renewable projects, said Wood Mackenzie analyst Diego Espinosa. ____ Associated Press writer Matthew Brown in Billings, Montana, contributed to this report.

"Trump says Coke will shift to cane sugar. But increasingly, shoppers want no sugar in their sodas",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-says-coke-will-shift-to-cane-sugar-but-increasingly-shoppers-want-no-sugar-in-their-sodas-2025-07-17/,"The debate over whether Coca-Cola should use high-fructose corn syrup or cane sugar in its signature soda obscures an important fact: Consumers are increasingly looking for Coke with no sugar at all. Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, which was introduced in 2017, uses both the artificial sweetener aspartame and the natural sweetener stevia in its recipe. It’s one of Coke’s fastest-growing products, with global case volumes up 14% in the first quarter of the year. By comparison, the company’s total case volumes were up 2%. PepsiCo also noted Thursday that 60% of its sales volumes in major markets in the second quarter came from low- or no-sugar drinks. “When you look at colas, the percentage of growth coming from zero sugar is significant,” said Duane Stanford, the editor and publisher of Beverage Digest. The scrutiny over Coke’s sweeteners began Wednesday, when President Donald Trump announced that Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Co. had agreed to switch to using cane sugar in the regular version of its beverage manufactured in the U.S. “I have been speaking to Coca-Cola about using REAL Cane Sugar in Coke in the United States, and they have agreed to do so,” Trump wrote on his social media site. “I’d like to thank all of those in authority at Coca-Cola. This will be a very good move by them — You’ll see. It’s just better!” Coca-Cola didn’t confirm the change. In a statement, the company said it appreciated Trump’s enthusiasm and would share details on new offerings soon. Stanford said he doubts Coca-Cola will fully shift away from high fructose corn syrup, which has sweetened Coke in the U.S. since the 1980s. There would be tremendous supply chain and logistics headaches, he said, and the U.S. doesn't make enough sugar for Coke's needs. He expects the Atlanta-based company will offer a cane sugar-sweetened version in the U.S. just like its rival Pepsi has been doing since 2009. He noted that Coke has indulged U.S. fans by importing Mexican Coke, which is made with cane sugar, since 2005. Coke positions Mexican Coke as an upscale alternative and sells it in glass bottles. The corn industry wasn’t happy with the speculation. In a statement Wednesday, Corn Refiners Association President and CEO John Bode said replacing high fructose corn syrup with cane sugar makes no sense and would cost thousands of American manufacturing jobs. Shares in ADM, a maker of high fructose corn syrup, dipped nearly 2% Thursday after Trump’s announcement. In a message on X, Coca-Cola defended high fructose corn syrup, saying it’s no more likely to contribute to obesity than table sugar or other full-calorie sweeteners. “It’s safe; it has about the same number of calories per serving as table sugar and is metabolized in a similar way by your body,” the company said. “Please be assured that Coca-Cola brand soft drinks do not contain any harmful substances.” The Food and Drug Administration also says there is no evidence of any difference in safety among foods sweetened with high fructose corn syrup and those that sugar, honey or other traditional sweeteners. Soft drink preferences are highly subjective, as anyone who has been in a Pepsi vs. Coke or 7-Up vs. Sprite debate knows. But recent trends indicate that Coke and other drink makers need to focus on the kinds of low- and no-sugar drinks that a growing number of consumers are seeking, according to Stanford. He said his data shows original Coke was the top seller by volume in the U.S. last year, with 19% market share, while Coke Zero Sugar was seventh and had a 4% market share. But Coke Zero Sugar's share grew 10%, while original Coke's share was flat. Paige Leyden, the associate director of food service, flavors and ingredients reports at the market research company Mintel, said drinks with a health halo like Olipop — which has 1 gram of sugars compared to original Coke's 65 grams — are also pressuring legacy soda makers. Mintel expects full-sugar sodas will see a 3.4% rise in U.S. sales this year, while diet sodas will see 11.8% growth. Still, nutritionists suggest avoiding added sugars, no matter the form, since they provide empty calories with no nutrients. The 2020 U.S. dietary guidelines advise people to limit foods and beverages higher in added sugars, and say children under 2 should not be fed them at all. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, whose nutrition views often diverge from mainstream nutrition science, has spoken out against sugar. His agency is expected to release updated nutrition guidelines later this year. “There’s things we’ll never be able to eliminate, like sugar,” Kennedy said at an April news conference. “And sugar is poison, and Americans need to know that.” Aspartame and other artificial sweeteners are also named as a concern in a government report Kennedy issued in May. ___ AP Health and Science Editor Jonathan Poet contributed from Philadelphia.

Connie Francis' 'Pretty Little Baby' became an unexpected TikTok hit — 63 years after its release,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/connie-francis-pretty-little-baby-became-an-unexpected-tiktok-hit--63-years-after-its-release-2025-07-17/,"Connie Francis was a giant of 1950s and '60s sugary-sweet pop, notching more than a dozen hits. In the months leading up to her death, announced Thursday, she experienced one more in “Pretty Little Baby,” which has become a viral hit on TikTok six decades after its release. As of Thursday, more than 22.5 million TikTok videos have been created using the sound, often partnering videos of baby animals, toddlers, makeup tutorials and retro fashions. According to TikTok, those videos have amassed more than 45.5 billion views, globally. Celebrities like Kylie Jenner, Kim Kardashian and North West have used it, too, with West lip-syncing along to the track. Hooky, feel-good pop songs tend to do well on TikTok, and 1962's “Pretty Little Baby” is an exemplar of that phenomenon. Users gravitated toward the song's wholesome simplicity, sweet vocals, delicate organ and upstroke riffs. “You can ask the flowers / I sit for hours / Telling all the bluebirds / The bill and coo birds / Pretty little baby, I’m so in love with you,” Francis swoons on the verse that has picked up steam on the platform. And all of this has transpired in mere months: According to Luminate, an industry data and analytics company, “Pretty Little Baby” was earning just over 17,000 on-demand audio streams in the U.S. during the week ending April 10. A month later, that number had climbed to 2.4 million. That’s a growth of over 7,000%. The song has earned over 29 million streams this year so far. In one popular video, which garnered over 56 million views, a user posted about baby teething hacks for first-time moms. Another user, Amari Goins, posted a video, with over 112 million views, of her 2-year-old daughter singing along to the lyrics, noting that her toddler picked up the song because of how often they heard it on TikTok. Most recently, TikTok users have begun posting covers of “Pretty Little Baby” as part of a singing challenge, where they exaggerate Francis' performance with their own stylized vocal runs. Francis, who died at 87, herself joined TikTok as a result of her song's popularity, and her first two videos — which earned 16.3 million and 31.2 million views, respectively — furthered engagement. In her first video, posted in early June, she said she was “flabbergasted and amazed” at the song's resurgence. “To think that a song I recorded 63 years ago is captivating new generations of audiences is truly overwhelming for me,” Francis said in that first post, which she followed with a clip of herself lip-syncing to the song. For decades, the song lived in relative obscurity — written by Don Stirling and Bill Nauman for Francis, it was never a single and was originally released in the U.K. as the B-side of her 1962 single “I’m Gonna Be Warm This Winter.” It appears on her album “Connie Francis Sings ‘Second Hand Love,’” released the same year. More than 60 years later, the song reached No. 20 on Billboard's Digital Song Sales chart in June 2025 and hit both the Hot 100’s Bubbling Under chart and the Billboard Global 200. In Francis' last TikTok video, posted late last month, she thanked the “many wonderful artists” who paid tribute to her, and all the users who sang along with her. Peter Lemongello Jr., a singer and performer who called Francis a friend, posted a TikTok in May where he sang the song to Francis, what he wrote on Facebook was “one of the greatest and most exciting moments of my career so far.” The video garnered over 15 million views. “There are no words to express this monumental loss,” he wrote in a Facebook post on Thursday. “I will be forever grateful to her for the help she gave me with my career.” Ian Paget, a TikTok creator, posted a tearful video Thursday and said he hopes Francis and her family “have felt that love from the younger crowd learning who she is.” The TikTok popularity of “Pretty Little Baby” prompted her label Republic/UMe Records to reissue versions Francis had sung in French, German, Italian, Spanish and Swedish in 1962. Bruce Resnikoff, president and CEO of UMe, wrote in a statement that the global catalog division was saddened but took “comfort in knowing how joyful and fulfilled she felt in these last few months, as a new generation discovered her music and celebrated her legacy.” In May, as the song took off, Francis thanked TikTok and its users for “the wonderful, and oh so unexpected, reception” in a Facebook post. As for her reaction to having a “viral hit”? She continued: “Clearly out of touch with present day music statistics terminology, my initial response was to ask: 'What’s that?'

"House sends bill regulating stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency, to Trump",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/house-votes-on-trio-of-cryptocurrency-bills-aimed-at-legitimizing-the-industry-2025-07-17/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The House has passed three bills intended to boost the legitimacy of the cryptocurrency industry with new regulations as President Donald Trump has pushed to make the U.S. the “ crypto capital of the world.” One of the three bills, legislation to regulate a type of cryptocurrency called stablecoins, had already passed the Senate with broad bipartisan support and will now head to Trump’s desk. The other two bills — a broader measure to create a new market structure for cryptocurrency and a bill to prohibit the Federal Reserve from issuing a new digital currency — will go to the Senate. The stablecoin bill, passed on a 308-122 vote, sets initial guardrails and consumer protections for the cryptocurrency, which is tied to a stable asset, often the U.S. dollar, to reduce price volatility. It passed the Senate with bipartisan support in June. “Around the world, payment systems are undergoing a revolution,” said House Financial Services Chair French Hill of Arkansas as lawmakers debated the stablecoin legislation Thursday morning. Hill said the bill will “ensure American competitiveness and strong guardrails for our consumers.” After Trump declared it “crypto week,” the bills were stalled for more than a day amid disagreements among House Republicans about how to combine the legislation. In the end, GOP leaders put the three bills for a separate votes, leaving the fate of the other two bills unclear in the Senate. The internal dissent could foreshadow challenges ahead for the more sweeping crypto legislation that Trump has demanded and the industry has poured millions into advancing. The stablecoin measure is seen by lawmakers and the industry as a step toward adding legitimacy and consumer trust to a rapidly growing sector. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in June that the legislation could help that currency “grow into a $3.7 trillion market by the end of the decade.” The bill outlines requirements for stablecoin issuers, including compliance with U.S. anti-money laundering and sanctions laws, and mandates that issuers hold reserves backing the cryptocurrency. Without such a framework, Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee in a statement warned, “consumers face risks like unstable reserves or unclear operations from stablecoin issuers."" After the votes, House Republicans strongly urged the Senate to take up the second bill, which would create a new market structure for cryptocurrency. Rep. Bryan Steil, R-Wis., said the 294-134 vote on that legislation shows broad bipartisan support and a “massive energy” on the issue. But it is so far unclear whether the Senate would consider the House bill or try to write its own. That legislation aims to provide clarity for how digital assets are regulated. The bill defines what forms of cryptocurrency should be treated as commodities regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and which are securities policed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. In general, tokens associated with “mature” blockchains, like bitcoin, will be considered commodities. The third bill, passed on a narrower 219-210 margin, prohibits the U.S. from offering what’s known as a “central bank digital currency,” which is like a government-issued form of digital cash. The crypto industry has long complained that unclear laws have made it difficult to operate in the U.S. and that the Biden administration tried to regulate it through enforcement actions rather than transparent rulemaking. Getting this bill passed has been a top priority for the industry, which has quickly become a major power player in Washington thanks to heavy campaign donations and lobbying. Advocates said the passage of the bills marks a key moment in cryptocurrency’s winding path toward mainstream adoption. Patrick McHenry, the former chair of the House Financial Services Committee and now vice chair of the crypto firm Ondo Finance, said the legislation will have a “massive generational impact,” similar to the securities laws Congress passed in the 1930s that helped make Wall Street the center of the financial world. “These bills will make the United States the center of the world for digital assets,” he said. While the bill has significant bipartisan support, it has also faced pushback from Democrats who say the legislation should address Trump’s personal financial interests in the crypto space. “No one should be surprised that these same Republicans’ next order of business is to validate, legitimize, and endorse the Trump family’s corruption and efforts to sell the White House to the highest bidder,” said California Rep. Maxine Waters, the top Democrat on the Financial Services panel. A provision in the stablecoin bill bans members of Congress and their families from profiting off stablecoins. But that prohibition does not extend to the president and his family, even as Trump builds a crypto empire from the White House. In May, the Republican president hosted a private dinner at his golf club in Virginia with top investors in a Trump-branded meme coin. His family holds a significant stake in World Liberty Financial, a crypto project that launched its own stablecoin, USD1. Trump reported earning $57.35 million from token sales at World Liberty Financial in 2024, according to a public financial disclosure released in June. A meme coin linked to him has generated an estimated $320 million in fees, though the earnings are split among multiple investors. Some Democrats also criticized the bill for creating what they see as an overly weak regulatory framework that could pose long-term financial risks. They’ve also raised concerns that the legislation opens the door for major corporations to issue their own private cryptocurrencies. “If this bill passes, it will allow Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg to issue their own money. The bill still permits Big Tech companies and other conglomerates to issue their own private currencies,” said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee.

What's in the Republican bill cutting $9 billion from public broadcasting and foreign aid,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/whats-in-the-republican-bill-cutting-9-billion-from-public-broadcasting-and-foreign-aid-2025-07-17/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Republican-led Congress has passed President Donald Trump’s request to claw back about $9 billion in public broadcasting and foreign aid spending. Trump's Republican administration is employing a rarely used tool that allows the president to transmit a request to cancel previously approved funding authority. Democrats tried to kill the measure but needed more Republicans uncomfortable with the president’s effort to join them. The Senate approved the vast majority of Trump's request in the early morning hours Thursday, 51-48. The House followed suit early Friday, 216-213. The measure now goes to the president to be signed into law. Here's a closer look at what's in the bill: Trump asked lawmakers to rescind nearly $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which represents the full amount it’s due to receive during the next two budget years. The White House says the public media system is politically biased and an unnecessary expense. The corporation distributes more than 70% of the money to more than 1,500 locally operated public television and radio stations, with much of the remainder assigned to National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service to support national programming. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said public broadcasting has been taken over by “partisan activists.” Still, the potential fallout from the cuts for local public media stations generated concerns on both sides of the political aisle. Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., said he secured a deal from the White House that some funding administered by the Interior Department would be repurposed to subsidize Native American public radio stations in about a dozen states. But many lawmakers say that won't help a large number of local broadcasting stations. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., unsuccessfully sought to take out the public broadcasting cuts. “If we don’t adopt this amendment, local television and radio stations will shut down and it will be rural stations that will be the first to close,” Baldwin said. To justify the spending cuts, the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers cited certain activities they disagree with to portray a wide range of a program’s funding as wasteful. In recent testimony, Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought criticized programming aimed at fostering diversity, equity, and inclusion. He said NPR aired a 2022 program entitled “What ‘Queer Ducks’ can teach teenagers about sexuality in the animal kingdom."" He also cited a special town hall that CNN held in 2020 with “Sesame Street” about combating racism. As part of the package, Trump asked lawmakers to rescind almost $8.3 billion in foreign aid programs that aim to fight famine and disease and promote global stability. A Senate amendment knocked the foreign aid cuts down to about $7.9 billion when Republicans agreed to remove what would have been a $400 million cut to PEPFAR, the politically popular program that began under President George W. Bush to combat HIV/AIDS. The program is credited with saving millions of lives. Among the rescissions in the bill: — $500 million of the $4 billion appropriated for global health programs funding activities to combat infectious diseases and promote maternal health. — $800 million for a program that provides emergency shelter, water and sanitation and family reunification for those forced to flee their own country. — $4.15 billion for two programs designed to boost the economies and democratic institutions in developing and strategically important countries. — $496 million to provide humanitarian assistance such as food, water and health care for countries hit by natural disasters and conflicts. —$361 million for international peacekeeping efforts, which are designed to stabilize conflict zones and protect civilians. The Trump administration also said some cuts, such as eliminating funding for UNICEF, would encourage international organizations to be more efficient and seek contributions from other nations, ""putting American taxpayers first.” Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.

Want Steady Income? 3 Top Dividend Stocks for July 2025,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/want-steady-income-3-top-dividend-stocks-for-july-2025/,"Earnings season is synonymous with market volatility. Growth-oriented investors may love trading the ups and downs, but more risk-averse investors may look for ways to generate solid returns balanced by steady cash flow. Dividend stocks are a solid option, particularly when you find companies with a history of paying and growing dividends over several years. This is a hallmark of companies that can grow revenue and earnings in any market. In July, three dividend-paying companies stand out as particularly compelling options. Together, these stocks can deliver reliable income for investors seeking shelter from the market’s ups and downs. Reliability is the primary goal of any dividend stock. A high yield or an attractive payout doesn’t matter much if the company can’t sustain it over the long term. That reliability has been on display with Johnson & Johnson NYSE: JNJ. The company has been embroiled in a lawsuit over its talc products for several years. At the same time, it’s navigating inflation and tariff concerns. JNJ has rewarded shareholders with a safe, growing dividend throughout. In fact, in the last two years, the dividend king has increased its dividend by over 4%. Its current dividend yield of 3.35% is better than the sector median average of 2%. However, that reliability doesn’t just relate to a company’s dividend. It can also relate to fear of missing out (FOMO). In the case of Johnson & Johnson, the stock is trading at an attractive valuation. However, with the company just getting ready to report its quarterly earnings, investors do not have any urgency to jump on JNJ stock, which has been in a consolidation pattern since early April. For many investors, dividend yield is their number one consideration for dividend stocks. However, sometimes a high yield can be a sign of other problems in the company. That’s not the case with Verizon Communications Inc. NYSE: VZ. Verizon’s business model isn’t exciting, but it proves that a boring business can still provide beautiful growth. That business model is the reason Verizon can pay a reliable dividend that yields 6.5%, putting it in the top 10% of its sector. VZ stock has delivered a total return of 47.14% in the last 10 years. That’s significant because the stock has delivered an above-average total return of over 8% in the last 12 months. Investors are responding positively to the company’s efforts to reduce capital expenditures as the 5G rollout winds up. The stock may not be done. It’s trading at around 9x forward earnings, a substantial discount to its historic average. The Verizon analyst forecasts on MarketBeat have a consensus price target that’s 14% above the stock’s closing price on July 15. Utilities stocks won’t make investors forget about the tech sector, but they’ve been having a better year than many sectors. That’s been particularly true of companies like Duke Energy NYSE: DUK. DUK stock is up 11% in 2025, and its dividend yield is 3.57%. At more than $65 billion, Duke Energy’s capital expenditure (capex) plan is among the largest among regulated utility companies. The company is investing in modernizing the existing electrical grid and continuing its solar and energy storage investments. Analysts are forecasting mid- to high-single-digit earnings per share (EPS) growth. Investors can bank on that forecast because Duke Energy is headquartered in North Carolina, which recently passed legislation that allows multi-year rate plans, performance-based ratemaking, and carbon reduction targets. The downside of the company’s capex plans is a significant debt load. As of July 15, the company’s debt-to-equity ratio was 1.57%, which is elevated by historical standards. However, if interest rates come down as expected, the company may be able to refinance that debt at better rates. Before you consider Duke Energy, you'll want to hear this.
