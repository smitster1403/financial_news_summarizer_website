The orders add to the existing orderbook and are expected to be executed over next 3-5 years, providing a 'steady revenue stream' with prototyping and full-scale production phases, said Axiscades. The latest orders are significant and add up to a third of the company's current orderbook which is reaching around Rs 1,800 crore. Spread across airborne, naval and radar-based platforms from defence laboratories, the orders involve development and supply of sub-systems for indigenous platforms being developed by DRDOs and other PSUs. This also deepens the company's involvement in key defence initiatives including fighter aircraft upgrades, naval modernization, and long-range surveillance radar systems, the company said. Axiscades listed out the key defence electronics programs and contributions that it has received in the latest order: 1. AESA Radar Program (Su-30 MKI Upgrade)The order involves development and supply of critical radar subsystems including the Exciter Unit, Receiver Unit, and Antenna Beam Control Motherboard. These components are vital and will replace the existing Russian radar on the Su-30 MKI, enhancing indigenous capabilities. 2. TR Modules for S-Band Surveillance RadarsDesign and delivery of advanced Transmit-Receive (TR) modules that significantly improve target detection, tracking accuracy, and signal fidelity in long-range surveillance operations. 3. LRBMR – KUSHAAxiscades will be supporting the development of indigenous Digital Beam Forming (DBF) units for the Long-Range Battle Management Radar (LRBMR). Operating in the S-band, this radar system offers a detection range of over 500 km, enabling simultaneous multi-target tracking and enhanced situational awareness. 4. Electric Heavy Weight Torpedo (EHWT)Design and delivery of the Homing Receiver, a critical component enabling autonomous target acquisition for next-generation submarine-launched anti-submarine warfare (ASW) torpedoes. 5. Submarine Sonar SystemsThis is a production order, and demonstrates the company's delivery of multiple sonar sub-systems, reinforcing growing presence in undersea warfare electronics. Axiscades' CTO C Manikandan said the orders reflect the core strength in radar, sonar, and electronics. ""These wins also highlight our deep integration into the ecosystem of India’s premier Defence research and production agencies."" Shares of Axiscades Technologies are up 95 percent so far this year."

The shares were trading at Rs 3,651, emerging as the top Nifty 50 gainer. The company on July 29 reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 3,617 crore for the April-June quarter of the financial year 2026. This marks a 30 percent on-year rise from the Rs 2,786 crore net profit reported in the same quarter last year. According to a Moneycontrol poll of six brokerages, the net profit of the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) major was expected to grow 25 percent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs 3,469 crore. L&T's revenue from operations rose 15.5 percent on-year to Rs 63,679 crore in Q1 FY26, as against Rs 55,120 crore in the year-ago period. Moneycontrol's poll had projected the firm's consolidated revenue to rise 15 percent YoY to Rs 63,451 crore. The company said the order inflow for the quarter ended June 30, 2025 stood at Rs 94,453 crore, registering a growth of 33 percent over the corresponding quarter of the previous year, due to the strong ordering momentum from countries in the Middle East Should you buy, sell or hold Jefferies maintained its 'Buy' call on the stock, and raised its target price to Rs 4,230 apiece from the earlier Rs 3,965 apiece. The international brokerage said that the firm's Q1 EBITDA was 7 percent ahead of its expectations as execution was higher. L&T’s 33 percent on-year rise in order inflows puts the company in a comfortable position to meet guidance, it added. Jefferies however noted that the firm's 15 percent YoY revenue growth guidance looks low, given the order book growth. JM Financial kept a 'Buy' call on the stock, but hiked its target price by 12 percent to Rs 4,313 per share. This implies an upside potential of more than 23 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. “L&T delivered strong positive surprise with order inflows at INR 945bn materially higher than our estimate of INR 566bn. We are reasonably confident of L&T exceeding its order inflow target of 10% growth based on multi-year uptick in Middle East tendering,” the domestic brokerage said, while adding that L&T was its top pick in the infrastructure space.

"GNG Electronics shares make strong market debut, list at 50% premium to IPO price",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ipo/gng-electronics-shares-make-strong-market-debut-list-at-50-premium-to-ipo-price-13348511.html,"The shares of GNG Electronics made a strong market debut on July 30, listing at Rs 355 apiece on NSE. This marks a premium of nearly 50 percent over the IPO price of Rs 237 per share. The listing premium is higher than grey market estimates. Ahead of listing, the unlisted shares of the company were trading with a grey market premium of nearly 38 percent over the IPO price at Rs 327 apiece, according to Investorgain. The maiden public issue of GNG Electronics saw bumper investor interest during its three days of public bidding. The Rs 460-crore IPO was subscribed nearly 147 times its offer size between July 23 and July 25, with Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs) booking their reserved portion a whopping 266 times. The refurbisher of laptops, desktops and other information and communication technology (ICT) devices had launched its public issue to raise Rs 460 crore through a fresh issue of shares worth up to Rs 400 crore, and an offer for sale of 255 crore shares. The company had set a price band of Rs 225-237 for the IPO which remained open for public bidding from July 23 to July 25. Prashanth Tapse, Research Analyst at Mehta Equities, recommended investors to book profits. ""GNG Electronics made a solid market debut, largely in line with our expectations, reflecting robust investor enthusiasm. However, post-listing valuations appear stretched, limiting immediate upside potential from current levels,"" he said. ""In light of this, we believe conservative investors should consider booking profits and capitalizing on the initial momentum. While Investors with a higher risk appetite or a long-term horizon may choose to HOLD, given the company’s scalable business model, strong positioning within the SME tech segment, and alignment with favourable sectoral trends. These fundamentals, in our view, support sustained long-term growth despite potential short-term volatility,"" he added. Shivani Nyati, Head of Wealth at Swastika Investmart, meanwhile recommended investors to secure partial profits and retain the remainder with a stop-loss set at 280. Mahesh M Ojha, AVP - Research and Business Development, Hensex Securities, said, ""Short-term investors may partially book profits, while long-term investors should evaluate the company’s performance over the next two to three quarters before making further investment decisions,"" he said. Narendra Solanki, Head - Fundamental Research (Investment Services), Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers, said GNG Electronics may benefit from a first-mover advantage in the electronics refurbishment space, especially in B2B segments. However, he cautioned that the business model is working capital intensive, with a lag between procurement and sales cycles. ""We had recommended a ‘Subscribe – Long Term’ rating. Investors allotted shares could consider booking partial profits on listing and hold the remaining for long-term gains,"" Solanki added. Follow all IPO news here.

Tata Motors slides over 4% as talks emerge on potential $4.5 billion Iveco deal,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/tata-motors-slides-over-4-as-talks-emerge-on-potential-4-5-billion-iveco-deal-13348621.html,"Shares of Tata Motors came under pressure on July 30, falling more than 4 percent after reports emerged that the Indian auto major is in advanced talks to acquire the truck division of Italy’s Iveco Group in a deal valued at $4.5 billion. According to CNBC TV-18, discussions between Tata Motors and the Agnelli family-owned Iveco are centred around the commercial and defence truck business. Iveco has publicly acknowledged that it is exploring a potential sale of its industrial vehicle unit, although a final decision is yet to be announced. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates If sealed, the transaction would mark the Tata Group’s second-largest buyout after the landmark Corus acquisition in 2007. It would also become Tata Motors’ biggest purchase since the $2.3 billion takeover of Jaguar Land Rover in 2008. The CNBC TV-18 report indicated that the boards of both companies could greenlight the deal as early as today. As per reports, trucks accounted for 70 percent of Iveco’s industrial revenue, while buses and powertrain divisions contributed 15 percent each. The Italian group held a 13.3 percent share in the light commercial vehicle (LCV) market in 2024 and had an 8 to 9 percent presence in the medium and heavy commercial vehicle space. Also read: India’s m-cap sees sharpest drop in 5 months, ranks fifth-worst globally in July The development gains significance as Tata Motors is in the process of spinning off its commercial vehicle segment into a separate entity by December 2025. That business, which generated revenue of Rs 75,000 crore in the previous financial year, holds a dominant 49 percent market share in India’s heavy commercial vehicle space and 30 percent in the LCV category. It also delivered an EBITDA of Rs 8,800 crore and free cash flow of Rs 7,400 crore, and is expected to be net cash positive at the time of the demerger. At about 9:45 pm, shares of the company were trading at Rs 670, lower by 3.3 percent from the last close on the NSE. Tata Motors' stock price is down 10 percent since the beginning of the year.

The firm's revenue fell marginally to Rs 8,939 crore in Q1FY26 as against Rs 8,970 crore in Q1FY25. The results are in line with estimates of a Moneycontrol poll of 7 brokerages. The poll pegged Asian Paints' Q1 revenue at Rs 8,905 crore and net profit at Rs 1,099 crore. Catch all the LIVE market updates on our blog Should you buy, sell or hold the Asian Paints stock? Jefferies has maintained a ‘Buy’ rating on Asian Paints and raised the target price to Rs 2,900 from Rs 2,830 per share. The new price implies an upside of 21 percent from the last close. The brokerage noted an improvement in decorative volume growth, which it sees as a key positive. Demand commentary from the company was encouraging, though the market remains competitive. Jefferies expects the recent correction in raw material costs to help absorb the impact of higher anti-dumping duties on titanium dioxide (TiO2). It views Asian Paints as a strong contrarian play, anticipating a recovery in volume growth ahead. HSBC also retained its ‘Buy’ call on Asian Paints but cut the target price to Rs 2,800 from Rs 2,900. The brokerage pointed to emerging green shoots in demand, although early monsoons have created a push-pull dynamic. It expects the company to benefit in the second quarter from an early festive season. While higher TiO2 prices remain a concern, these could be balanced out by softer prices for other raw materials. HSBC has lowered its FY27 and FY28 revenue and EBITDA estimates by 1–3 percent but continues to maintain a positive view, expecting a broadly stable competitive environment over the medium term. It forecasts a 12 percent EBITDA CAGR over FY25–28. Also read: Fed likely to hold rates steady despite political pressure, markets eye possible cut in September The paints industry saw a modest recovery this quarter, supported by improved urban demand, though June monsoons tempered momentum. Asian Paints reported a 0.2 percent dip in India coatings revenue. The domestic decorative paints segment posted a 3.9 percent volume growth, while revenue declined 1.2 percent. Industrial coatings grew 8.8 percent, led by strong performance in the auto and protective segments. Operating margins were slightly lower year-on-year due to higher sales and marketing spends. The home décor business remained muted amid weak retail consumption, though the Beautiful Homes Stores performed well. International markets delivered robust growth, with revenue up 11.1 percent on a like-to-like basis and 20.4 percent in constant currency, driven by strong performance in the Middle East and South Asia. ""We remain confident in the long-term potential of the home décor and paints industry, and continue to invest in innovation and brand strength,"" said Amit Syngle, MD & CEO, Asian Paints. Asian Paints shares have gained 5 percent since the beginning of the year.

""Sustained FII selling in the cash market for the seventh consecutive trading day is another headwind for the market, he added. At market open on July 30, sectoral indices were trading mixed. The India VIX was up 1.3 percent at 11.68, indicating a slight rise in market volatility. Among the laggards, Nifty Auto slipped 0.61 percent, while Nifty Bank and Nifty Midcap 100 were down 0.09 percent and 0.08 percent, respectively. Private banks and oil & gas stocks were also marginally in the red. On the other hand, buying was seen in select sectors. Nifty Infra gained 0.51 percent, Nifty Media rose 0.69 percent, and Nifty Smallcap 100 was up 0.47 percent. Nifty Metal, Pharma, Energy, and PSU Bank indices also posted modest gains. The Nifty FMCG and Nifty Realty indices were flat, while Nifty IT was little changed. Consumer durables inched up 0.22 percent. As for individual stocks, Ather Energy gained over 2 percentS after the electric vehicle maker signed an MoU with the Commerce Ministry to speed up growth in clean mobility and advanced manufacturing, as part of the Build in Bharat initiative led by Startup Policy Forum (SPF), a government statement said on July 29. Following the development, Nomura and HSBC initiated coverage with a buy on the counter. Shares of Asian Paints fell over a percent after the company reported a 6 percent decline in net profit at Rs 1,100 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, as against Rs 1,170 crore a year ago. The firm's revenue fell marginally to Rs 8,939 crore in Q1FY26 as against Rs 8,970 crore in Q1FY25. Jefferies and HSBC have maintained their buy rating on the counter. Technical View Nifty’s strong short-covering rally and close above 24,800 signal a tentative short-term bottom, but a decisive move above 24,850 is crucial for sustained upside momentum. However, as the index trades below the key moving-average cluster near 25,000 — which also acts as a psychological barrier — sellers may continue to dominate on higher levels. Until Nifty reclaims and holds above the 25,000 mark, the broader bias will remain cautious, and rallies could be used to initiate fresh shorts rather than interpreted as a structural reversal. With key events like the FOMC meeting and monthly expiry ahead, the index may witness volatile swings in both directions. L&T, JSW Steel, NTPC, Bharti Airtel, and Bharat Electronics were the top gainers on the Nifty. Laggards on the index included Tata Motors, HUL, Dr Reddy's, Coal India, and ICICI Bank.

"Ather Energy shares rise over 3% as HSBC, Nomura initiate coverage with buy rating",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/ather-energy-shares-in-focus-after-hsbc-nomura-initiate-coverage-with-buy-rating-13347968.html,"Shares of Ather Energy rallied over 3 percent after the electric vehicle maker signed an MoU with the Commerce Ministry to speed up growth in clean mobility and advanced manufacturing, as part of the Build in Bharat initiative led by Startup Policy Forum (SPF), a government statement said on July 29. Following the development, Nomura and HSBC initiated coverage with a buy on the counter. As part of the tie up, Ather Energy will focus on 'strategic mentorship' for deep-tech startups, along with infrastructure-related support for upcoming players in the EV value chain. Catch all the LIVE market updates on our blog Nomura and HSBC have set target prices of Rs 458 and Rs 450 per share, respectively. Both brokerages are upbeat on Ather’s growth prospects, driven by the accelerating shift towards electric vehicles in the two-wheeler (2W) segment. Nomura expects EV penetration in the 2W market to rise from 6 percent in FY25 to 19 percent by FY30. It believes ICE (internal combustion engine) volumes are likely to peak by FY30, aligning with the expected rollout of BS-VII emission norms. While legacy players had a clear edge in the ICE era, the EV transition has reset the playing field. As a result, market shares a decade from now could look very different, and long-term value creation will hinge on a company's success in EVs and exports. In this context, Nomura sees Ather as a significant beneficiary of the EV shift. Also read: India began diversifying away from China before 2025 halt in fertiliser shipments HSBC highlights Ather's position as the fourth-largest EV 2W maker, with a 14 percent market share. It believes Ather’s strong product quality and tech leadership are difficult to replicate, even for larger rivals with deep pockets. HSBC expects technology and distribution expansion to drive further market share gains. The brokerage forecasts a revenue CAGR of 47 percent between FY25 and FY28 and expects the company to achieve EBITDA breakeven by Q4FY27. It also notes that Ather’s stock performance will depend more on its execution than overall industry growth, with faster EV penetration offering meaningful upside to earnings and valuation. Bengaluru-based EV maker Ather Energy narrowed its net loss to Rs 234.4 crore in the January–March quarter of FY25, down from Rs 283.3 crore a year ago, driven by strong demand for its flagship family scooter, the Rizta. The company’s revenue for the quarter rose 29 percent year-on-year to Rs 676 crore, up from Rs 523.4 crore, driven by higher sales of 40,700 vehicles compared to 35,908 units in Q4 FY24. Despite a 12.6 percent rise in expenses to Rs 922.2 crore from Rs 818.7 crore, Ather’s EBITDA loss narrowed to Rs 172.5 crore from Rs 238.5 crore. Ather Energy shares closed at Rs 345, higher by 1.75 percent from the last close.

"Sensex, Nifty set for muted open as trade deal worries linger; key levels to track on July 30",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sensex-nifty-set-for-muted-open-as-trade-deal-worries-linger-key-levels-to-track-on-july-30-13347090.html,"Benchmark indices Nifty and Sensex are likely to open on a subdued note as sentiment takes a hit following US President Donald Trump’s threat of steeper tariffs on Indian goods, with uncertainty over a trade deal continuing to linger. Meanwhile, investors will keep a close watch on the US Fed’s policy meeting, where rates are expected to remain unchanged. At about 7:55 am, the GIFT Nifty was trading at 24,794, lower by 0.2 percent or 31 points. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Dalal Street bounced back on Tuesday, July 29, as broad-based buying lifted all sectors into the green. Benchmark indices rose around half a percent, snapping a three-day losing streak amid bargain hunting.Further, volatility and fear in the markets continued to moderate, with the India VIX index slipping over four percent to 11.54. Here are the key levels to watch out for in today's session Nifty’s strong short-covering rally and close above 24,800 signal a tentative short-term bottom, but a decisive move above 24,850 is crucial for sustained upside momentum. However, as the index trades below the key moving-average cluster near 25,000 — which also acts as a psychological barrier — sellers may continue to dominate on higher levels. Until Nifty reclaims and holds above the 25,000 mark, the broader bias will remain cautious, and rallies could be used to initiate fresh shorts rather than interpreted as a structural reversal. With key events like the FOMC meeting and monthly expiry ahead, the index may witness volatile swings in both directions. ""The index has successfully held its critical demand zone between 55,500 and 55,800, suggesting that a short-term floor may have been established at these levels. However, it continues to hover below the crucial resistance zone of 56,500–56,800, which needs to be cleared for the rally to gain traction,"" Dhupesh Dhameja of SAMCO Securities said. ""Structurally, the index remains below its short-term moving averages — the 10-DEMA and 20-DEMA — both currently positioned between 56,600 and 56,800, forming a confluence of resistance that is capping the upside. The index remains caught in a broad consolidation band, and only a breakout on either side will dictate a stronger directional bias,"" he added. The India VIX cooled off by 4.46 percent, settling at 11.52 — staying well below the psychological level of 13. This low-volatility environment implies that while there is intraday profit booking, there's no panic-driven liquidation, reinforcing the view of a range-bound market rather than a full-fledged breakdown. The Put-Call Ratio (PCR) has moved marginally higher from 0.59 to 0.60, indicating some buildup in calls that may continue to act as overhead resistance rather than signalling bullish strength.

"Sun Pharma Q1 Preview: Earnings likely to rise on India, specialty strength; margin impact from new launches",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/sun-pharma-q1-preview-earnings-likely-to-rise-on-india-specialty-strength-margin-impact-from-new-launches-13347065.html,"Sun Pharmaceutical Industries is set to announce its Q1FY26 results on August 1, with analysts expecting a steady topline and bottom-line performance supported by strong India growth and sequential improvement in the US specialty business. However, higher investments towards product launches and R&D are likely to exert some pressure on margins. According to a Moneycontrol poll, Sun Pharma’s consolidated revenue is estimated to grow 8 to 9 percent year-on-year (YoY) to around Rs 13,500 to 13,800 crore, while net profit is seen rising 2 to 7 percent YoY to about Rs 2,900 to 3,050 crore. EBITDA is expected to come in the range of Rs 3,700 to 3,910 crore, with margin likely to decline slightly by 10 to 90 basis points YoY. BNP Paribas' revenue estimates, as mentioned in its note, are in line with consensus, while EBITDA is marginally higher, considering launch-related costs will ramp up from Q2 onwards. It went on to add that the full impact of two specialty product launches — Leqselvi and Unloxcyt — is likely to be felt in subsequent quarters.  There is a narrow divergence in earnings estimates across brokerages, so any deviation from consensus could trigger sharp stock movement. What factors are likely to drive its earnings? Sun Pharma’s growth in Q1 is seen as broad-based but measured, with domestic formulations, US specialty sales, and some support from gRevlimid driving topline expansion. However, these gains could be partly offset by foreign exchange losses and higher launch-related costs. Sun Pharma is expected to deliver healthy double-digit domestic growth for an eighth consecutive quarter, according to Emkay Global's latest note. Thus, projecting a 10.5 percent YoY rise in India revenue, aided by strong performance in chronic and specialty segments. HSIE concurs, highlighting traction in chronic, CNS and specialty products, and adds that Sun is likely to outperform IPM’s \~7.2 percent growth, partly due to its branded chronic exposure. India business: Expected to grow 10 to 12 percent YoY, driven by volume gains, in-licensing deals, and new launches. Price hikes and medical rep expansion have also aided productivity, noted B\&K Securities. US business: Sales may rise 5 to 6 percent QoQ to about USD 460 to 488 million, supported by stable gRevlimid contribution and higher specialty sales, including Ilumya and Winlevi. Emkay estimates specialty revenue at USD 310 million, up from USD 295 million last quarter. However, the overall US market remains volatile amid channel stocking and pricing pressure. While Sun Pharma guided for USD 100 million of launch costs for new specialty products, we believe Q1 margins will remain stable with pressure emerging in later quarters, BNP Paribas noted. gRevlimid: Contribution expected to improve QoQ but remain lower YoY due to intensified competition. According to BOB Capital, Revlimid-linked growth is tapering, and gRevlimid sales are unlikely to be offset by new approvals in the near term. Margins: EBITDA margin may see a 10 to 90 bps YoY contraction, largely due to elevated R&D and forex losses. Sun incurred an estimated Rs 505 crore forex loss during the quarter, as per B&K Securities. What to watch out for in the quarterly show? Analysts will be keenly watching Sun’s commentary on its specialty portfolio, the ramp-up of newly launched drugs, and any guidance on margin trajectory, especially with USD 100 million in launch costs expected to reflect more meaningfully in Q2 onwards. Further, updates on US pricing dynamics, progress in pipeline drugs, and commentary around the tariff environment for pharma exports will be closely tracked. Sun Pharma remains one of our top picks in the sector, driven by its robust India franchise and differentiated US portfolio, mentions Nirmal Bang's latest note. It also cautioned that cost normalisation and price erosion in generics could act as a headwind.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Lupin, State Bank of India, Tata Chemicals, Syngene International, PI Industries, Escorts Kubota and others on July 30?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-lupin-state-bank-of-india-tata-chemicals-syngene-international-pi-industries-escorts-kubota-and-others-on-july-30-13346727.html,"The benchmark indices rallied for the first time in the last four sessions, with the Nifty 50 rising 0.57 percent on July 29. The market breadth was also supported by the bulls. A total of 1,744 shares advanced compared to 916 declining shares on the NSE. The market is expected to remain rangebound and consolidative in the upcoming sessions. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Amol Athawale, VP Technical Research at Kotak Securities Lupin | CMP: Rs 1,984.6  After a decline from higher levels, Lupin rebounded from its support zone and witnessed a steady recovery. Additionally, on the daily charts, the counter has given a breakout from its sloping channel formation. The recent upmove suggests a new leg of the bullish trend from current levels. For the next few trading sessions, Rs 1,910 could act as the trend-deciding level for the bulls. If it sustains above this level, we can expect a further uptrend toward Rs 2,120. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,120 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,910 LIC Housing Finance | CMP: Rs 598.25  After a short-term price correction, LIC Housing Finance is now available near its multiple support zones. The bullish momentum near the support area indicates that the downside is likely restricted. Therefore, the current rebound in the stock is expected to continue with a favourable risk–reward profile. As long as the stock is trading above Rs 575, the bullish texture is likely to continue. A move above this level could take the stock to Rs 640. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 640 Stop-Loss: Rs 575 State Bank of India | CMP: Rs 799.20  After a remarkable upmove on a weekly basis, SBI witnessed profit booking at higher levels. Following the recent selloff, the downward momentum appears to have paused. Moreover, the counter has found support near its multiple demand zones. The formation suggests a potential revival of the uptrend in the near future. For positional traders, Rs 770 would be the decisive level. Trading above this level would suggest continuation of the uptrend towards Rs 850. However, a close below Rs 770 may prompt traders to exit long positions. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 850 Stop-Loss: Rs 770 Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities Tata Chemicals | CMP: Rs 1,000  After a rangebound action over the past few weeks, Tata Chemicals witnessed a sharp upside breakout this week amidst volatility in the benchmark indices. The stock price moved above the crucial resistance of the consolidation range at Rs 960 on Tuesday and closed higher. Hence, there is a strong possibility of further upside momentum in the near term. Volumes have started to expand during the breakout, and the daily 14-period RSI shows a positive signal. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,105 Stop-Loss: Rs 940 Syngene International | CMP: Rs 711.4  Syngene has been forming a rounding bottom pattern on the weekly chart over the past few months. The current weekly candle pattern indicates a decisive upside breakout following the formation of a higher bottom at Rs 621 earlier this month. Volume has expanded during the breakout, and the weekly 14-period RSI shows a bullish indication. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 785 Stop-Loss: Rs 670 PI Industries | CMP: Rs 4,249.5  PI Industries has been in a decisive upside rally for the last 3–4 months. A bullish structure of higher tops and bottoms is visible on the weekly timeframe chart. After a minor downward correction recently, the stock is now poised to surpass the crucial hurdle around Rs 4,250 this week. Volume expanded on Tuesday during the upside breakout, and the weekly 14-period RSI pattern suggests more upside ahead. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 4,675 Stop-Loss: Rs 4,050 Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors Man Industries | CMP: Rs 454.8  Man Industries has been moving in a higher-high, higher-low structure within its upward-sloping channel since March 2025. In the previous session, the price managed to break out of its Rs 405–448 range with a gain of over 5%, which is a strong bullish sign. Last week, the price found support at the baseline (red) of the Ichimoku Cloud and rebounded nearly 9%. The medium-term support as per this indicator is near Rs 425. Additionally, the ADX is at 35, well above 25, indicating positive momentum is likely to continue. A break above Rs 461 can lift the price toward Rs 480 followed by Rs 500. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 480, Rs 500 Stop-Loss: Rs 442 Escorts Kubota | CMP: Rs 3,489.8  In the prior session, Escorts Kubota gained more than 2%. Last week, prices retested the downward-sloping trendline and are now near the previous swing high of Rs 3,500, suggesting growing bullish activity. A decisive break above this level could further boost positive momentum. Furthermore, the 15-period and 30-period EMAs have recently formed a bullish crossover. As long as this crossover remains intact, the daily bias remains on the bullish side. Escorts Kubota is currently on the verge of a breakout. A move above Rs 3,500 could lead to a trending rally toward Rs 3,620 followed by Rs 3,730. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,620, Rs 3,730 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,380 Coromandel International | CMP: Rs 2,495.4  In the previous session, Coromandel International gained more than 3%. The stock has managed to hold above the prior day’s low for the last seven trading sessions, which is a positive sign. On the daily chart, the stock is trading in a rectangular range between Rs 2,200 and Rs 2,520 since May 2025, indicating accumulation. A close above Rs 2,520 could result in a bullish breakout from this pattern. Additionally, the KST (Know Sure Thing) indicator is trading above the zero line after crossing above the signal line, implying a potential buildup in momentum in the coming sessions. A decisive break above Rs 2,520 is required for further buying, with targets of Rs 2,620 followed by Rs 2,700. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,620, Rs 2,700 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,420 Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

In its adjudication order, Sebi imposed a penalty of Rs 10 lakh on the Rupesh Satish Dalal HUF. Sebi investigated trades conducted between November 2021 and April 2022, following a suspicious trading report submitted by the NSE regarding shares of HDFC Limited and HDFC Bank. The merger between HDFC Bank and HDFC Limited was announced on April 4, 2022, on the exchanges, leading to a 9-10 percent rise in the share prices of both entities. Sebi’s investigation revealed that the trades were strategically timed and concentrated in stocks directly affected by the merger news. Sebi emphasized that the valuation and structural details of the merger were material, price-sensitive information and had been misused. SEBI’s investigation found that a former Deloitte India employee was a friend of the son of Rupesh Satish Dalal and suspected that unpublished price-sensitive information (UPSI) was sourced through this connection. The Deloitte employee was part of the valuation team for the merger deal. Based on the UPSI, Sebi suspected that the Rupesh Satish Dalal HUF took derivative positions in the scrips of HDFC Bank Limited and HDFC Limited. Sebi also observed that, aside from HDFC and HDFC Bank, the HUF had only traded in Infosys contracts during the investigation period. The Sebi investigation report stated, “The Noticee had bought multiple call option contracts of HDFC Ltd. and HDFC Bank Ltd. prior to the announcement of the merger/amalgamation and sold the said call options post-announcement. From the aforementioned tables, it was observed that the Noticee earned a profit of Rs 5.67 lakh in HDFC and Rs 2.52 lakh in HDFC Bank.” In its order, Sebi noted: “As it has been established that the Noticee violated Regulations 3(2) and 4(1) of the PIT Regulations and Sections 12A(d) and (e) of the SEBI Act, the Noticee is liable for payment of a monetary penalty under Section 15G of the SEBI Act.” According to the Sebi adjudication order dated December 20, 2024, two individuals in the same case had settled the matter by paying Rs 39 lakh and Rs 35 lakh, respectively. The HDFC–HDFC Bank merger, completed in July 2023, was the largest in India’s financial sector, creating a financial behemoth with combined assets exceeding Rs 18 lakh crore. The incident reinforces Sebi’s stance on zero tolerance for insider trading."

The Nifty index nearly tested the crucial support zone of its medium-term moving average, the 100-day EMA, in early trade, followed by a gradual recovery that lasted until the close. As a result, it ended near the day’s high at the 24,821.10 level. Notably, all key sectors contributed to the recovery, with realty, pharma, and energy emerging as the top gainers. The broader indices also found some relief, posting gains in the range of 0.81% to 1.05%. The recovery in the Nifty was driven by oversold positions in heavyweight stocks, coupled with the presence of strong support at the 100-day EMA. However, participants should avoid reading too much into a single-day bounce and remain focused on selective stock picking and disciplined trade management, given the next resistance around the 25,000–25,100 zone. Moreover, the upcoming derivatives expiry and global developments could add to market volatility in the near term. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities Nifty formed a bullish engulfing pattern on the daily chart, suggesting the possibility of a meaningful bullish reversal. On the 2-hourly chart, the index has started a recovery supported by a positive divergence. In addition, a hidden positive divergence is visible on the daily chart, further indicating the potential for a smart recovery in the short term. On the higher side, Nifty may move towards 24,950–25,000. A decisive move above 25,000 could trigger a rally towards 25,200. On the downside, support is placed at 24,750.

We maintain that only directionally better credit cost may not suffice given the business environment’s tough history; any exuberance should be tempered with the experience of lingering challenges faced in the last four years, viz.: 1) higher credit cost during Covid-19 and its escalation in FY24; 2) higher cost to income during the BNPL surge; 3) structural decline in revolver mix; 4) higher CoF post-Covid-19; 5) increase in risk weights; and 6) now, a resurgence of the credit cost cycle in FY26. Outlook Maintain HOLD; INR 884 TP unchanged We expect PAT of INR 24bn/INR 30bn for FY26E/FY27E. This results in RoAA of ~3.5%/3.8% for FY26E/FY27E and RoAE of ~16.1%/17.4% in FY26E/FY27E.

Eicher Motors Q1 Preview: Revenue to rise 17% on strong volumes; margins to dip on high ad spends,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/eicher-motors-q1-preview-revenue-to-rise-17-on-strong-volumes-margins-to-dip-on-high-ad-spends-13343733.html,"New Delhi-headquartered Eicher Motors Limited is set to release its earnings report for the first quarter of FY26 on July 31. Analysts expect a solid pickup in revenue on strong volumes and price hikes undertaken by the company. However, margins are expected to witness a sharp decline during the quarter. According to a Moneycontrol poll of seven brokerage firms, the Royal Enfield-maker is anticipated to record a 17.2 percent year-on-year increase in revenue, reaching Rs 4,959 crore. Net profit is projected to rise 3 percent to Rs 1,120 crore from Rs 1,088 crore in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year.  Earnings estimates from analysts polled by Moneycontrol are in a narrow range, indicating that any positive or negative surprises could trigger a sharp reaction in the stock price. What factors could affect Eicher Motors' earnings? Strong volumes: The company registered a 17 percent increase in volumes to 2.65 lakh vehicles, compared with 2.26 lakh units sold in the same quarter of the previous year. EBITDA contraction: The EBITDA margin is expected to decline by nearly 400 basis points year-on-year during the quarter. Margins are expected to be weighed down by elevated marketing expenses and costs associated with new product launches, partly offset by operating leverage benefits. Commodity Pressures Persist: The company is likely to gain from price hikes taken over the past year and an increasing share of exports. However, persistent commodity inflation continues to drive up input costs, potentially limiting the full benefit to margins. What to look out for in the quarterly show? Investors will be keen to understand retail demand trends and the actual impact of marketing spends on sales performance. Commentary on the outlook for international markets will also be closely tracked. Guidance on FY26 production plans, along with management’s view on commodity cost headwinds or tailwinds during the quarter, will be important. Additionally, the market will look for updates on upcoming model launches. Eicher Motors' stock price was trading at Rs 5,459, higher by 1.4 percent from the last close on the NSE. Eicher Motors shares have risen 13 percent since the beginning of the year.

Orient’s emphasis on premiumisation and portfolio optimization persists, as it expands its footprint in high-growth categories. Takeaways: (1) Orient reported modest revenue growth (1.9% YoY) led by its lighting segment (+6.7% YoY). (2) ECD segment’s growth was flat YoY amid competitive pricing pressure. In ECD, fans saw muted growth, coolers’ sales tumbled 40% YoY while water heaters reported double-digit growth. (3) The company’s cost-saving strategy enabled it to save INR 90mn in Q1FY26, which bodes well in the long run. (4) In-house PCB production and backward integration of BLDC motors have enhanced quality and design of the products. (5) Orient has added ~1,800 retailers under its DTM network.

We believe this is a sound growth target, especially when compared to mixed trends of credit, motor and health premium growth among other parameters and when juxtaposed with ~14% overall private APE CAGR between FY19–25. VNB margin guidance remains at 26–28% while the company continues to have a very strong record of positive operating variance/assumption changes. Product mix improvement (launch of non-par product), better productivity (branch and agent) and demand recovery in high-margin segments provide scope for positive margin surprise and could offset the impact of lower volumes on VNB. These arguments vs. its sound track record (APE/VNB/EV CAGR of 15.3%/21.8%/20.5% between FY20-25) and attractive valuation (1.9x FY27E P/EV) keep us constructive on SBI Life. Outlook We factor in VNB margin of 27.5% and model 15% APE growth in FY26E/27E (8.6%/9.2% YoY APE growth and 27.8%/27.5% VNB margin in FY25/Q1FY26).

However, the underlying operating revenue remained flat YoY, at INR 46bn, owing to: 1) additional revenue from new transmission assets, largely offset by lower depreciation in cost-plus assets; 2) Dahanu plant divestment in base quarter, impacting distribution revenue despite higher energy sales YoY (+1%).

Analysts expect an uptick in revenue, driven by a strong product mix, better auto/farm volume growth and realisation. On the flipside, margins are likely to witness a slight decline during the quarter. According to a Moneycontrol poll of six brokerage firms, the automaker’s revenue is likely to rise 24 percent year-on-year to Rs 33,471 crore. Net profit is projected to jump 19 percent to Rs 3,112 crore, up from Rs 2,613 crore in the year-ago period.  Earnings estimates from analysts polled by Moneycontrol are in a diverse range, indicating that any positive or negative surprises could trigger a sharp reaction in the stock price. Most optimistic brokerage -- Nirmal Bang -- has forecasted a 36 percent increase in net profit. On the flipside, HDFC Securities -- the most pessimistic brokerage -- projects a 9.2 percent rise in net profit. What factors could aid Mahindra and Mahindra's earnings? Strong Volumes: Automotive revenues are projected to grow 27 percent, supported by a 17 percent rise in volumes, led by robust demand in the SUV and export segments. Tractor segment revenues are likely to increase 13 percent, aided by a 10 percent volume growth. Rich Mix: The Thar maker is expected to witness a rise in average selling prices (ASPs) in the tractor segment by 2 percent, while ASPs in the automotive segment may rise 8.5 percent, reflecting a higher share of EVs and a lower contribution from LCVs. Margin Pressure: Analysts across brokerages expect EBITDA margins to trim. The Moneycontrol poll forecasts a 60 basis points drop driven by an increasing share of electric vehicles in the mix and rising steel prices. ""In the passenger vehicle segment, M&M will likely be the only player to report strong double-digit growth in UVs at 22 percent year-on-year on the back of new launches,"" Motilal Oswal said in its preview note. What to look out for in the quarterly show? Key areas to watch include the volume ramp-up plans for the BE.06 and XUV.e9, guidance on tractor volumes, and insights into rural demand trends.

EBITDA Contraction: The country's largest four-wheeler OEM is expected to witness a 210 basis points decline in margins due to negative operating leverage, higher personnel cost due to wage increases revision, higher marketing and advertisement spends/ forex costs being partly offset by increased sales of CNG vehicles, exports and realignment of one-time costs in the previous quarter. Tepid Volumes: The company will witness a 1 percent rise in volumes during the first quarter. This comes after heavy rains, price hikes, and liquidity stress hurt showroom footfalls, while a high base and lack of fresh launches weighed on conversions. Maruti sold 5.27 lakh vehicles in Q1, up from 5.21 sold in the same period last year. UV Sales Drop: While the company's exports rose in Q1, this benefit was partially offset by a slight dip in the share of utility vehicles (UVs), which accounted for 30.7 percent of volumes in Q1FY26 compared to 31.3 percent in Q1FY25. ""Additionally, increased discounting in the entry-level vehicle segment is putting some pressure on overall margins and profitability,"" Axis Securities said in its automobile preview note.

Hold Steel Authority of India; target of Rs 133: Prabhudas Lilladher,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/hold-steel-authority-of-india-target-of-rs-133-prabhudas-lilladher-2-13343102.html,"Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Steel Authority of India SAIL delivered weak operating performance in Q1FY26 due to inventory revaluation loss in RM and higher other expenses. Volumes grew 4% YoY (incl NSL’s low contribution volumes, total volume growth was 13% YoY). Higher royalties and other expenses negated the benefit of higher steel prices. The average NSR grew 5% QoQ, aided by better flat and long product prices, driven by the implementation of safeguard duty and higher GoI capex. Blended EBITDA/t was weak at Rs5,695/t adjusting for the prior period rail price revision impact of Rs 1.73bn. We expect even weaker Q2 as domestic prices have declined since early June on monsoon led weakness in demand. SAIL is undertaking largely sustenance and debottlenecking capex in the near term and actual growth capex cash outflow would start from FY27. Tendering process at ISP is in progress and mgmt. expects ordering by Q3. ISP’s 0.5mtpa debottlenecking expansion is expected by FY28E. We expect SAIL to remain a play on steel prices as long-term volume growth would depend upon successful execution of planned capex. We tweak our FY26/27E EBITDA estimates by ~4/- 1% assuming higher NSL contribution. Outlook At CMP, the stock is trading at an EV of 6.4x/5.3x FY26/FY27E EBITDA. Maintain ‘Hold’ with revised TP of Rs133 (Rs136 earlier) giving 5.5x Mar’27E EV/EBITDA.

Our FY26/ FY27E EBITDA broadly remain unchanged. TRP reported Rs 90bn (80% of total sales) worth of highly profitable branded formulation sales spread across India, Brazil and RoW markets. The acquisition of JB Chemicals & Pharma (JBCP) appears strategically compelling, making it the 5th largest player in the domestic pharma market. This will further be strengthening its position in high-margin chronic therapies and opens up many newer therapeutic areas. The deal also adds JBCP’s CDMO vertical, offering diversification and growth optionality. The deal is considered financially attractive and strategically sound with long -term earnings accretion. TRP trades at 23x EV/EBITDA on FY27E for the combined business. Outlook We maintain our Accumulate with revised TP of Rs4,000/share, valuing at 26x EV/EBITDA on FY27E for combined entity.

"Gensol Engineering seeks bids to lease its 4,000-car EV fleet for a monthly rental",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/gensol-engineering-seeks-bids-to-lease-4000-ev-on-monthly-rental-13342793.html,"Troubled EPC player Gensol Engineering, undergoing Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP), has released an advertisement seeking bids from interested parties to lease pre-owned electric vehicles for a fixed monthly lease rental. “The cars are available at a fixed monthly lease rental and a nominal down payment,” the Interim Resolution Professional said. Gensol Engineering, in the advertisement, said that around 4,000 pre-owned electric vehicles are available for lease in Delhi-NCR and Bengaluru. These electric vehicles were leased by Gensol Engineering to a related entity - BluSmart Mobility – which was founded in 2019 to provide sustainable urban transport. Following BluSmart’s troubles after the Gensol saga, many other players are likely willing to fill this space. Some of the companies running EV cabs in major cities - Evera Cabs, Uber Electric and Everest Fleet – are expected to bid for the lease of Gensol Engineering’s cabs. One veteran of the mobility business said, “There is enough space for EV cabs in urban mobility, as conscious customers prefer such cabs and are ready to pay higher charges for a good service.” He added, “…there is definitely a robust market for such cabs, but it will also depend on the condition of the vehicles, as the operations of BluSmart have been suspended since April, so the EV fleets of Gensol may require maintenance, especially the battery.” An email sent to Interim Resolution Professional Keshav Khaneja seeking further details of the leasing terms did not elicit any response. Operations of BluSmart were suspended following a Sebi crackdown against Gensol Engineering’s promoters. Market regulator Sebi had passed an interim order against Gensol Engineering on April 15, restraining the company and promoters from accessing the securities market. It also directed the promoters - Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi - to step down from the board of the company. Sebi had found in its preliminary investigation that loans of Rs 977.75 crore were taken from PSU NBFCs - IREDA and PFC - out of which only Rs 663.89 crore was for purchasing 6,400 electric vehicles. Moneycontrol was the first to report that Gensol Engineering was under Sebi scanner. Sebi had found that Gensol procured only 4,704 electric vehicles (EVs) against the 6,400 EVs for which it had secured funding, and spent only Rs 567.73 crore on electric vehicles. Sebi has alleged that the rest of the funds were not used for EV purchase but diverted for personal usage by the promoters. Rating agency ICRA had first flagged the issue of falsified documents of debt servicing for the first time, and Care Rating too also flagged concerns around Gensol Engineering in March this year. Sebi received a complaint in June 2024 relating to manipulation of share price and diversion of funds from GEL, and thereafter started examining the matter. After Sebi’s interim order, agencies such as Enforcement Directorate and Ministry of Corporate Affairs too have initiated investigations into the company."

This comes after a report said that Panasonic is in talks to acquire a controlling stake in the NSE-listed light fittings-maker for nearly Rs 526 crore. Japan-headquartered Panasonic is planning to acquire the entire 55 percent shareholding of the firm's promoters, The Economic Times reported citing people familiar with the matter. The remaining 45 percent stake is owned by the public. A potential deal will trigger a compulsory open offer to the company's public shareholders for at least 26 percent stake, according to market regulator SEBI's guidelines, the report added citing sources. The acquisition would cost Panasonic nearly Rs 526 crore, including the potential 26 percent open offer, the report added. Negotiations are at an advanced stage, but the due diligence of Focus has brought certain issues to the surface which need to be addressed before signing the contract, the report said. Moneycontrol couldn't independently verify the report. The publication cited a spokesperson for Panasonic's electric works business divisions (formerly Anchor) as saying that the speculation appears to be unfounded, and no such information has been shared yet. Focus Lighting and Fixtures is engaged in the manufacturing and trading of LED lights and fixtures. The company had listed on NSE's SME platform in 2017. It was shifted to the mainboard segment in 2021. According to the latest data on the firm's shareholding pattern, Managing Director and Founder Amit Vinod Seth owns nearly 51 percent stake in the company. Its notable clients include Mercedes Benz, BMW, Tata Motors, Shoppers Stop and more, according to its website. The shares of the company have gained more than 2 percent in the past five days, but lost nearly 4 percent in the past one month. The stock is down more than 23 percent in 2025 so far. It currently has a P/E ratio of 42.97.

Sequentially NII stood flat, led by higher finance costs on account of increased external borrowings. Total operating income grew by 24.6% YoY (1.9% QoQ) to INR 5,207 Mn, majorly led by increase in net interest income. Pre-Provision Operating Profit (PPoP) grew by 8.0% YoY (-2.1% QoQ) to INR 3,659 Mn., led by stronger momentum in NII growth driven by sharp ramp-up in AUM.

However, the company took an impairment of Rs1.4bn during the quarter on account of take-or-pay. As a result, despite higher-than-estimated volume, the company reported an in-line EBITDA of Rs11.6bn (Ple Rs11.9bn, BBGe Rs12.6bn, -26% YoY, -23.3% QoQ). PAT came in at Rs8.5bn (Ple Rs8.1bn, BBGe Rs9bn, -25% YoY, - 20.5% QoQ). Concerns remain on utilization of its assets amidst rising competition, especially from the recently commissioned Chhara LNG terminal and completion of breakwater facility at Dabhol LNG terminal. Ongoing capex on petrochemical project is also expected to be ROCE dilutive. Outlook We value the stock at Rs311 (previous Target Price Rs315), based on 10x (unchanged) FY27 EPS.

While credit cost was controlled (at 2.1%), Stage 2 increased by 40 bps QoQ. We remain conservative and build a higher credit cost of 2.1% for FY26E (vs. guidance of <2%). We marginally tweak our FY26/ FY27 estimates and expect SHFL to deliver RoA/ RoE of 3.3%/ 17.0% in FY27E, led by steady growth in AUM, favourable margin profile and controlled asset quality ratios.

While NII was cushioned as cash was utilized to pay-off borrowings, Q2FY26 would see impact of normal liquidity and 50bps repo cut suggesting NIM decline QoQ. However, H2FY26 NIM could improve due to CRR cut and deposit repricing. While loan growth was healthy at 4.2% QoQ, it was led by SME and mid-market. Barring housing, retail growth was sluggish due to weak demand while unsecured recovery is slower. Hence, we trim loan growth by 100bps for FY26/27E to 16% YoY. Asset quality worsened QoQ due to higher net slippages/provisions led by MFI stress and slower corporate recovery. Outlook We cut NIM & fees, increase provisions but reduce opex; net cut in core PAT for FY26/27E is avg. 4.2% We tweak multiple to 2.3x from 2.4x on Mar’27 core ABV and slightly reduce TP to Rs2,350 from Rs2,400.

TTAN will be paying an EV of AED 1038mn, which will be funded through a debt of Rs12bn and small funding from reserves. Damas has debt of ~700mn AED and working capital is funded by gold metal loan. TTAN plans to close stores catering to Se Asian population with gold jewellery and convert many of these into Tanishq stores. 3 Graff stores (20% of sales) are not a part of this transaction while 110 signature stores will be scaled up. 2025 will be the year of re-structuring and the transaction will be EPS dilutive in CY26. It will be EPS neutral in CY27 and will be EPS accretive only in CY28. This acquisition provides Titan plans to leverage its expertise in sourcing, inventory management, and customer acquisition to drive backend and technological efficiencies which along with superior gross margin, and improved product mix will drive margins higher. Outlook At current sales of Rs26.3bn (ex of Graff), DAMAS EV/Sales multiple stands at 0.95x, which is in-line with most global retailers. We believe, Damas acquisition will add value over next 3-4 years and does not add any upside in the near to medium term.

More importantly, the Direct business stood on a strong footing, grew 1.6% QoQ CC, led by BFS (+8.1% QoQ) and Insurance (+21.0% QoQ). The record high deal TCV of USD760m (80%+ New Gen) aided by four large deal wins in Q1 of three 100m+ TCV and one 50m+ TCV. Despite having recorded notable large wins in Q1, the deal funnel still looks encouraging (84% YoY). BFS and non-BFS pipelines are up 47% YoY and 108% YoY, respectively. We believe the company’s strong participation in AI-led transformation (68% AI-led deal pipeline) and taking ownership of client budgets through inevitable AI investments, partly de-risk the discretionary churn. The consistent increase in large deal wins and steady conversion rate (TCV to Revenue), which is missing in many of its peers, gives us confidence to stay positive on Mphasis. Outlook We are baking revenue growth of 6.2%/8.0% YoY CC with EBIT margin of 15.5%/15.7% for FY26E/FY27E. We are assigning 26x to FY27 EPS, translating a TP of 2,920.

Mgmt guided strong US revenues of $1bn for FY27 despite gRevlimid erosion. We expect Cipla to maintain its existing US sales run-rate. This will be aided by several high value niche launches in the US like gAbraxane, Nilotininb, gAdvair. Further, Cipla’s strong net cash position of +$1.5bn provides flexibility to pursue strategic M&A opportunities. Our FY26E/27E EPS broadly remain unchanged. At CMP, stock is trading 23x FY26E EPS.

Fall in reported NIM at 6-7bps QoQ was lower to peers (11-18bps decline). NIM may remain under pressure in Q2FY26 due to lead-lag impact of repo rate cut on loans/deposits. However, bank expects 70% of deposits to reprice within 1-2 quarters suggesting that NIM would start improving since Q3FY26. Loans de-grew by 2.0% QoQ due to 10% fall in corporate; however, BOB expects corporate growth of 8-10% YoY for FY26; we are factoring overall loan growth of 11% YoY in FY26.

Ather Energy ties up with government to strengthen EV manufacturing ecosystem,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/ather-energy-ties-up-with-government-to-strengthen-ev-manufacturing-ecosystem-13341768.html,"Electric vehicle maker Ather Energy has signed an MoU with the Commerce Ministry to speed up growth in clean mobility and advanced manufacturing, as part of the Build in Bharat initiative led by Startup Policy Forum (SPF), a government statement said on July 29. Shares of Ather Energy were off lows in a quiet session of trade, higher by close to a percent. Since its listing in May 2025, shares of Ather are higher by close to 14 percent. As part of the tie up, Ather Energy will focus on 'strategic mentorship' for deep-tech startups, along with infrastructure-related support for upcoming players in the EV value chain. The partnership will aim to accelerate the growth of clean mobility and advanced manufacturing sectors. Ather will conduct innovation programs along with DPIIT, co-hosted skill development, and participation in Startup Mahakumbh to encourage the development of the clean mobility ecosystem. Tarun Mehta, the co-founder and CEO of Ather Energy said, “We are happy to collaborate with DPIIT to strengthen support systems for hardware and deep-tech startups. With policy support and stronger industry participation, this initiative can help founders tackle core technology challenges and scale high-quality products from India.” The initiative is aimed at supporting India's transition towards sustainable transport and help create an enabling environment for manufacturing-focused startups. After the MoU, Sanjiv Singh DPIIT Joint Secretary said India's electric mobility space is entering a transformative phase. “Through this partnership with Ather Energy, we aim to catalyse the development of an enabling environment where startups can contribute meaningfully to EV manufacturing, battery innovation, and clean energy solutions,” Sanjiv Singh added. This collaboration opens up opportunities for EV startups by supporting a future-ready, self-reliant ecosystem aligned with climate goals and manufacturing-driven aspirations. Shweta Rajpal Kohli, President and CEO, Startup Policy Forum said the partnership is vital for SPFs 'Build in Bharat' initiative, and unlocks the potential of manufacturing through collaboration. Ather Energy narrowed its losses in the March quarter of FY25 to Rs 234.4 crore on strong demand for top-selling 'Rizta' family scooters. Indian EV makers are gradually preparing for a future without subsidies, as the Centre plans to phase out or reduce incentives for electric vehicles, transitioning from manufacturing sops to pricing and technology. Earlier this year, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal had said that India's EVs do not need fresh incentives. “India’s electric mobility segment is ready and set to fly. There is no need for new incentives as the existing ones are sufficient to kick-start the ecosystem,” Goyal said in January 2025."

Technical View The index has decisively broken down from its prolonged consolidation phase, violating multiple support levels and confirming a bearish shift in the near-term structure. If the Nifty breaches 24,650 on a closing basis, we may witness accelerated unwinding, pushing the index further down toward the 24,500–24,450 band. On the upside, the resistance zone has now migrated downward to 24,960–25,000, and any attempted relief rally toward this band may face renewed supply pressure. Until the index reclaims and sustains above 25,000, the broader bias will firmly remain negative, and rallies may be used to initiate fresh shorts rather than as signs of reversal The ongoing breakdown clearly signals a shift in sentiment, and it’s crucial for traders to remain aligned with the prevailing trend. JSW Steel, IndusInd Bank, Jio Financial Services, ONGC, and Tata Consumer Products were the top gainers on the Nifty. Laggards on the index included Bharat Electronics, Eternal, Infosys, Wipro, and SBI Life Insurance.

The lender reported a 68 percent decline in standalone net profit at Rs 684 crore, hurt by a decline in loans and a rise in provisions for potential bad loans. On a consolidated basis, net profit fell 72 percent year-over-year to Rs 604 crore. The lender's net interest income fell 14 percent year-on-year to Rs 4,640 crore in Q1FY26. According to Moneycontrol's poll, IndusInd Bank's net interest income (NII) was seen at Rs 4,279 crore in Q1FY26 and profit was pegged at Rs 559 crore in Q1FY26. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Should you buy, sell or hold the IndusInd Bank stock? Macquarie has an underperform call with a target of Rs 650, implying a downside potential of 19 percent from the last close on the NSE. Its Q1 profit was in line with expectations, supported by higher NIMs and treasury gains, but these were offset by weak fee income. Elevated slippages led to higher credit costs, and the brokerage expects return on assets (RoAs) to stay below 1 percent in the near term. CITI has a sell rating and a target price of Rs 765. The brokerage said Q1 results pointed to a gradual reset in key levers such as NIM, fee income, and credit costs. While legacy issues didn’t reappear, fee-to-assets dropped to 1.2 percent, and credit costs stayed high at 2 percent. Slippages in the MFI portfolio nearly halved, but stress in vehicle finance and broader retail led to overall slippages of 3 percent. GNPAs rose across segments, though core NIM at 3.35 percent was a positive surprise. CITI believes improvement depends on stabilising NIMs, growing fees, cutting costs, and lowering credit costs. CLSA has a hold call with a target of Rs 725. The international brokerage noted that management is focused on stabilising the business, and the board has submitted MD & CEO nominations to the RBI. Loans and deposits both fell 3 percent quarter-on-quarter, mainly due to weakness in the wholesale segment. Core NIM declined by 12 basis points QoQ, in line with trends seen in other large private lenders. Bernstein is outperforming on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,000. It noted that Q1 results showed no impact from previous clean-up efforts, but persistent issues remain, including asset quality deterioration, weak fee income, and subdued NIMs. Bernstein flagged the lack of clear levers to improve RoA in the near term, which may prompt a reassessment of the bank’s profitability outlook. During the quarter, the Bank’s Total Capital Adequacy Ratio as per Basel III guidelines (excluding Q1 profits) stands at 16.63 percent as on June 30, 2025, as compared to 17.04 percent as on June 30, 2024.

"Sensex, Nifty set for weak open amid mixed global cues; key levels to track on July 29",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sensex-nifty-set-for-weak-open-amid-mixed-global-cues-key-levels-to-track-on-july-29-13340662.html,"Sensex and Nifty are set to extend their losing streak on July 29, as global jitters and disappointing earnings weigh on sentiment. US markets ended mixed after a strong start, while Asian peers slipped. The GIFT Nifty was down 40 points at 24,665 around 7:45 pm, signalling a weak open. Bears dragged Dalal Street deep into the red, while selling pressure in key financial stocks also contributed to heavy losses in the Nifty 50 and Sensex indices, on Friday, July 25. All sectoral indices, barring pharma and healthcare, sank deep into the red. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates On July 28, Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) were net sellers to the tune of Rs 6,082 crore worth of shares in Indian equities, while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) net bought Rs 6765 crore worth of shares, according to provisional NSE data. This is the highest net selling by FIIs since May 30 and the highest net buying by DIIs since June 17. Here are the key levels to watch out for in today's session The index has decisively broken down from its prolonged consolidation phase, violating multiple support levels and confirming a bearish shift in the near-term structure. If the Nifty breaches 24,650 on a closing basis, we may witness accelerated unwinding, pushing the index further down toward the 24,500–24,450 band. On the upside, the resistance zone has now migrated downward to 24,960–25,000, and any attempted relief rally toward this band may face renewed supply pressure. Until the index reclaims and sustains above 25,000, the broader bias will firmly remain negative, and rallies may be used to initiate fresh shorts rather than as signs of reversal The ongoing breakdown clearly signals a shift in sentiment, and it’s crucial for traders to remain aligned with the prevailing trend. ""The current week brings elevated event-risk with the FOMC meeting and updates on US trade tariff policies looming large. Against this backdrop, the index decisively slipped below its 50-Day exponential moving average, currently anchored near 56,110, which had repeatedly served as a key cushion in recent declines—its violation has further aggravated market jitters. A decisive break and close beneath the 56,000 handle would likely escalate selling intensity, potentially dragging the benchmark toward the 55,500–55,450 zone in the short run,"" Dhupesh Dhameja of SAMCO Securities said. The India VIX spiked by 6.98 percent, closing at 12.06, continuing its upward journey for the second straight session—marking a cumulative 11 percent rise in just two days. This suggests that participants are bracing for heightened volatility in light of key global cues. That said, VIX remains below the 13 mark, indicating that long-term investors are not exiting en masse. The Put-Call Ratio (PCR) slipped further from 0.65 to 0.59, reflecting increased call exposure and a tilt in favor of bears. However, the falling PCR is approaching oversold territory, warranting close observation as it may signal short-term exhaustion. This reallocation of positioning by both option writers suggests that traders are bracing for additional downside but are also staying agile amid an event-driven week.
