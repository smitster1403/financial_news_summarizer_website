Dow notches record high as Wall Street cheers Powell's speech,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/dow-notches-record-high-as-wall-street-cheers-powell-s-speech-13481463.html,"Wall Street's main indexes ended higher on Friday, with the blue-chip Dow hitting a record closing high, as investors piled into stocks after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted at a near-term interest-rate cut during his Jackson Hole Symposium speech. His comments paved the way for a potential rate cut at the Fed's September meeting, although Powell stressed the importance of jobs and inflation data due before then. ""Powell did what central bankers do best at Jackson Hole — he kept the door open,"" said Nigel Green, chief executive of deVere Group. “A cut in September would reassure households and businesses that the central bank is not asleep at the wheel. Delaying only raises the odds of a harder landing."" Traders boosted bets on a September rate cut after Powell's comments, now placing a nearly 90% chance of a reduction, versus about 75% before Powell's remarks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 846.24 points, or 1.89%, to 45,631.74, surpassing its most recent record close on December 4, 2024. The S&P 500 gained 96.74 points, or 1.52%, to 6,466.91 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 396.22 points, or 1.88%, to 21,496.54. Ten of the 11 S&P 500 sub-sectors traded higher, with consumer discretionary (.SPLRCD), opens new tab the biggest gainer, up 3.18%. The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index soared 2.7%, while most megacap growth stocks also jumped. Tesla led gains with 6.2%. The rate-sensitive Russell 2000 Index surged 4.1%, hitting its highest level so far this year. With gains on Friday, the S&P 500 snapped a five-day losing streak after a broad selloff in heavyweight technology stocks pressured U.S. equities this week. For the week, both the S&P and Dow ended with gains, while the Nasdaq fell 0.6% as investors sold this week megacap tech stocks and rotated into less-pricey stocks. U.S. stocks have rebounded sharply from April lows - when markets were rattled by President Donald Trump's tariff announcements. Recently, indexes have been getting back up to record highs. A spate of resilient earnings, optimism around trade deals and growing chances of interest-rate cuts have been some of the main gain drivers, although some concerns persist.""Investors are cheering Powell's comments like it's the start of a rate-cut parade. But one cut won't move the needle on consumer spending. The bigger question is whether this marks a true pivot in Fed policy — or if rising tariffs will force it to slam the brakes before that shift even begins,"" said Zak Stambor, senior analyst for retail and ecommerce at Emarketer. Earlier in the day, UBS Global Wealth Management lifted its year-end target for the S&P 500 for the second time in two months, betting on corporate earnings strength, easing trade tensions and expectations of interest-rate cuts. Among other top movers, Intel gained 5.5% as the White House was expected to announce on Friday the acquisition of a 10% stake in the company. Coinbase (COIN.O), opens new tab also soared 6.5% as investors scooped up crypto-related shares after Powell's speech. Intuit dropped roughly 5% after the TurboTax-maker forecast first-quarter revenue growth below analysts' estimates due to weak performance at its Mailchimp marketing platform. Workday shed 3% after the human resources software provider provided an in-line outlook for the current quarter. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 9.43-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. There were 590 new highs and 42 new lows on the NYSE. The S&P 500 posted 37 new 52-week highs and no new lows while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 166 new highs and 47 new lows. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 17.93 billion shares, compared with the 17.08 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days."
"US takes nearly 10% Intel stake, clinching unorthodox deal",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/us-takes-nearly-10-intel-stake-clinching-unorthodox-deal-13481324.html,"President Donald Trump sealed a deal that gives the US government a nearly 10% stake in Intel Corp., part of an unconventional bid to reinvigorate the beleaguered company and boost domestic chip manufacturing. Under the agreement, the US will receive 433.3 million shares of common stock — representing 9.9% of the fully diluted common shares in Intel — according to a statement from the company. The $8.9 billion investment will be funded by grants from the US Chips and Science Act and Secure Enclave program that had previously been extended but not yet paid, Intel said, confirming a report by Bloomberg News. Together with the $2.2 billion in Chips Act money that Intel already received, the investment totaled $11.1 billion. The government will be a passive owner, with no board seat or other governance or information rights, Intel said. “We are grateful for the confidence the president and the administration have placed in Intel, and we look forward to working to advance US technology and manufacturing leadership,” Intel Chief Executive Officer Lip-Bu Tan said in the statement. Intel shares rose 5.5% to $24.80 at the close in New York on Friday. They slipped about 1% in choppy postmarket trading after the deal was finalized. In a social media post, Trump described the transaction as a “great Deal for America and, also, a great Deal for INTEL.” “Building leading edge Semiconductors and Chips, which is what INTEL does, is fundamental to the future of our Nation,” he said. The US taking partial ownership marks a stunning level of intervention in an American company, cutting against the principles of free-market capitalism that investors and policymakers have long considered sacrosanct except in the most extraordinary situations, such as war or a systemic economic crisis. The administration considers it an extraordinary and unique situation — and sees semiconductor production as a matter of national security, a White House official said. Intel is one of a small number of American companies capable of making chips at scale on domestic soil, the official said, and the administration looks to avoid shortages like those in recent years that rattled US supply chains. Though the administration telegraphed its intentions with Intel in recent weeks, the move creates untold risks that could distort markets and the flow of capital as well as lead to massive taxpayer losses. But the government’s bet could also pay off in a major way for a onetime industry pioneer. Intel has faced a turbulent stretch with investors worried it is losing its technological edge and falling too far behind competitors. The approach represents a new way for Trump to wield Chips Act funding, after long assailing the law signed by his predecessor, former President Joe Biden. Trump has said the law’s subsidies for semiconductor manufacturers didn’t provide any return for US taxpayers. Intel was already poised to be the biggest beneficiary of money from the Chips Act. As part of the pact, the government will receive a five-year warrant — at $20 per share for an additional 5% of common stock — that’s only exercisable if Intel ceases to own at least 51% of its chip-manufacturing business. PJT Partners served as Intel’s financial adviser on the transaction. Santa Clara, California-based Intel touted its more than $100 billion effort to expand manufacturing in the US and its new factory in Arizona, which is set to begin high-volume production this year. But it didn’t discuss a facility planned for Ohio that has been repeatedly delayed. The deal represents a dramatic reversal from earlier this month, when Trump called for Tan’s ouster and accused him of being “highly conflicted” because of concerns over his earlier ties to China. Those remarks prompted the sit-down between the president and the Intel CEO, laying the groundwork for Friday’s deal. “I said, ‘You know what? I think the United States should be given 10% of Intel,’ and he said, ‘I would consider that,’ and I said, ‘Well, I’d like you to do that,’” Trump said of his discussion with Tan. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has signaled that Trump wants to see more direct benefits to the US from funding key companies instead of just giving away grants. Lutnick worked to finalize the details of the agreement since Tan and Trump’s meeting. While the White House has cast the Intel deal as a possible template for other companies, they haven’t said which ones it may be having similar discussions with. A US official, however, said that companies that are boosting US investment pledges, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Micron Technology Inc., will not be pressured to offer equity in exchange for funding. The fresh infusion of nearly $9 billion instantly boosts growth prospects for the company. It also opens the door to partnerships that could be critical in developing new intellectual property and technology, areas where Intel has lagged in recent years. Still, in order for government ownership to boost Intel, Trump will have to do more than just take a stake. Wall Street analysts don’t expect money alone to turn around the company, which has suffered from years of declining sales and market share. But there is a possibility that pressure from Trump will help line up more clients for Intel’s production arm, potentially justifying the cost of expanding domestic manufacturing. “Trump kind of becomes your salesman,” said Dan Morgan, a senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust who has covered the company since the 1990s. Lining up more Intel clients might be a tough sell for Trump. The company’s chip-manufacturing arm is widely considered inferior to rivals and it still must build new cutting-edge facilities. “Beside money, Intel needs customers,” Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said in a note to clients. “Funding a buildout with no customers probably won’t end well for shareholders, of whom the US government would be the largest under this situation,” he said. In its statement, Intel said it was “deeply engaged” with current and potential clients and partners that could help build up the US chip supply chain. Microsoft Corp., Dell Technologies Inc., HP Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.’s AWS all pledged support as part of the announcement. “The industry needs a strong and resilient US semiconductor industry, and no company is more important to this mission than Intel,” Michael Dell, CEO of the namesake computer maker, said in the statement. The Intel deal exemplifies how Trump has embraced a new brand of economic statecraft in his second term, as he looks to bolster domestic manufacturing, rebalance trade ties and ensure American dominance in critical sectors. Trump in early August announced a legally questionable arrangement with Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., in which they agreed to give the US government 15% of revenue generated from sales of artificial intelligence chips to China. That followed Trump securing a “golden share” from Nippon Steel Corp. that gives the president power to make decisions over United States Steel Corp., which the Japanese steelmaker acquired. The Defense Department last month also announced that it will take a $400 million equity stake in little-known US rare-earths firm MP Materials Corp."

"SEBI chief calls for more caution, transparency from MFs when investing in microcaps, debt papers",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sebi-chief-calls-for-more-caution-transparency-from-mfs-when-investing-in-microcaps-debt-papers-13481048.html,"Market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) Chairman, Tuhin Kanta Pandey, appreciated the efforts of the mutual fund industry in channelising savings at an event marking 30 years of the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI). However, he also cautioned the industry about investing in microcaps and certain debt instruments. Pandey said, “While there is a need to diversify beyond blue chips, mutual funds—as a retail product—should exercise caution while investing in microcaps or debt papers through bespoke deals. Maintaining proper documentation for such investment decisions ensures transparency and sound due diligence.” The SEBI chief also advised the industry to ensure that no preferential treatment is given to any class of investors during subscriptions or redemptions. He said, “By strictly adhering to the cut-off time for all classes of unit holders, the industry can instill a greater degree of confidence among investors.” Pandey further highlighted that beyond investment risks, the industry must also be mindful of operational risks that could undermine investor confidence. He noted, “One such concern is the menace of fraudulent redemptions by impersonators. As fraudsters grow more creative, we must remain vigilant.” He added that whenever such cases are detected, asset management companies (AMCs) must act promptly and monitor emerging patterns in these practices. Sharing such modus operandi across AMCs and registrar and transfer agents (RTAs) is essential to immediately prevent recurrence. “In this battle, speed of information is our greatest weapon,” he emphasised. The SEBI chief also pointed to the vulnerabilities that come with growing reliance on technology. “As more investors interact digitally, even a single breach can cause lasting damage to investor confidence,” he warned. Pandey also stressed the importance of data privacy, saying, “Protecting that data is as important as protecting their money. It must be a top priority for mutual funds.” On outsourcing, he remarked that while outsourcing has enabled efficiency, it does not reduce accountability. “Mutual funds remain fully responsible for the actions of vendors or partners. AMCs’ agreements with vendors or third parties must ensure there is no scope for data leakage,” he said.

On this Foundation Day, I urge you to innovate responsibly, balance creativity with caution, grow inclusively, reach investors in every village, town, and city, and uphold trust relentlessly.” He concluded by saying, “Mutual funds are not just financial products; they are enablers of aspiration, bridges to opportunity. Today, as a reaffirmation of our collective mission, let us make mutual funds not just ‘sahi hai,’ but ‘zaruri hai’—not just the right choice, but the default choice, depending on varying risk appetites and financial goals.”"

Foseco India announced that it has entered into a share purchase agreement to buy 42 lakh shares of Morganite Crucible (MCIL), representing 75 percent of its total share capital, for a total cash consideration of Rs 653.94 crore. The company will buy the stake from MCIL promoters at Rs 1,557 per share. The stake acquisition will be done by issuing and allotting 11.51 lakh fully paid-up equity shares of the Foseco India (constituting 15.27 percent of its total issued and paid-up share capital), to the MCIL promoters at a price of Rs 5,674 per consideration share. MCIL promoters will get 274 consideration shares of Foseco India for every 1,000 shares of MCIL they own, as part of the preferential allotment of shares. The stake acquisition will trigger a mandatory open offer by Foseco India. ""The execution of the Share Purchase Agreement for the Underlying Transaction will trigger a mandatory open offer by the Company together with the Company Promoters (in their capacity as 'persons acting in concert’ with the Company)...for the acquisition of up to 14 lakh fully paid-up equity shares of MCIL, representing 25 percent of the total equity voting share capital of MCIL on a fully diluted basis, from the public shareholders of MCIL, at a price of Rs 1,557.15 per Offer Share aggregating to a total consideration of up to Rs 218 crore,"" it said. MCIL is associated with the business of designing, manufacturing, marketing and selling crucibles and other foundry consumable products for various metal melting and handling applications. ""This proposed acquisition aligns with the larger acquisition of the worldwide Molten Metal Systems business by the Vesuvius Group from the Morgan Group. The rationale for the proposed acquisition is to expand the Vesuvius Group’s Foundry business into the faster-growing non-ferrous market segment and to India, in line with the Group’s strategic ambitions. The global MMS business is complementary to the Vesuvius Group’s Foundry business and will also increase the Vesuvius Group’s global Foundry business’s exposure to the Indian market. Substantial cost synergies are expected to create value for the Vesuvius Group,” Foseco India said. Foseco India shares later pared some gains to close nearly 14 percent higher at Rs 6,380 apiece.

JLL delivered a modest Q1FY26 performance amid a challenging demand environment, with revenue up by 1.4% YoY on 3.6% volume growth, while value growth was constrained by higher grammage and promotional pricing. Gross margin contracted 280bps YoY to 48.5%, due to input cost pressures and heightened competition in the Dish wash segment. EBITDA margin stood at 16.5%, in line with guidance, while PAT declined 4.9% YoY to Rs. 96.8cr. A&P Spend moderated to Rs. 58.9 crore (7.8% of revenue), balancing brand investment with margin protection. H2FY26 to see improvement in margins and the company guides for 16-17% EBITDA margin for FY26. Segment wise, Fabric Care led the growth (3% YoY) while Dishwash and Personal Care remained stable. Household Insecticides (HI) remained under pressure (-9.7% YoY), though management reiterated its turnaround focus with new launches and pricing actions. New launches across categories (Ujala Young & Fresh, Jovia, Maxo aerosols) are gaining traction, with more planned in H2FY26 to drive growth. Outlook We value JLL at a P/E of 34x (2yr avg=36x), with a target price of Rs. 412, and recommend BUY rating supported by rural tailwinds, innovation-led growth, improving urban sentiment and recent stock price correction.

The dip in the 13.8% EBITDA margins (16.2%, Q1 FY25) is attributed to one-time provisions. YTD orders were diverse (EPC, BESS, T&D). Execution is the key monitorable as ~50% of orders (~Rs73bn of ~Rs147bn) awaits AD or LOA. The ~Rs10.5bn leverage is high but expected to normalize on disbursement from solar SPVs. Proceeds from approved monetisation of five HAM assets in FY26 would fortify the BS. We retain FY26/27e revenues but reduce EBITDA margins ~64/24bps. We introduce FY28e revenue/EBITDA of ~Rs85.4bn/12.3bn. Outlook We are retaining our Buy rating with a lower sum-of-parts TP of ~Rs1,339 (earlier Rs1,749), the core EPC business at 9x Sep’27e EPS considering delayed receipt of AD and the foray into uncharted solar, BESS and T&D.

SEBI’s expiry-day clampdown: Can it curb alleged Jane Street-style manipulation?,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sebi-s-expiry-day-clampdown-can-it-curb-alleged-jane-street-style-manipulation-13480420.html,"The Securities and Exchange Board of India’s (Sebi) plan to impose penalties for intraday position breaches on expiry days could put large algo funds and prop desk on the guard, but will not be adequate to meaningfully curb the “Jane Street–style” alleged manipulation that triggered regulatory scrutiny, traders say. As Moneycontrol reported on August 19, Sebi is weighing a new framework under which intraday position limits will be raised to Rs 5,000 crore net delta (from Rs 1,500 crore), while the gross cap remains at Rs 10,000 crore. Breaches on expiry days could invite financial penalties, whereas on non-expiry days they would only trigger surveillance. Currently, Sebi has not formally defined intraday limits, though exchanges are advised to monitor the same thresholds through the session. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Market participants say penalties will certainly make prop desks cautious about their trades on expiry days because of heightened surveillance, yet they may not be effective in preventing manipulation. They cite two main reasons. First, limits apply to a single PAN. Large proprietary desks already split trades across multiple accounts to remain below thresholds. Second, surveillance lacks tools to track exposures of entities acting in concert — the very issue raised in Sebi’s allegations against Jane Street. Unless there is a mechanism for the exchanges to track group exposures in real time, they will be ineffective in calling out rogue trades. While no single prop desk in India currently has the kind of capital that could move markets like Jane Street did, a similar effect could be achieved with large prop desks acting in concert. Currently, Gross Future Equivalent (FutEq) OI for a single PAN is capped at Rs 10,000 crore. It would cost about Rs 80–240 crore in premium to buy ATM options or about Rs 3,000–4,000 crore to sell options to hit the gross position limit of Rs 10,000 crore. If, while selling options, insurance legs are added, margin requirements reduce by around one-third. The popular strategy of selling a plain straddle with insurance (short iron butterfly) would require capital (margin requirement) of roughly Rs 1,200 crore, according to rough calculations by veteran trader Santosh Pasi. This is fairly sizable for a single entity – not because the capital is big but the risk it entails is not since options are being sold.

Even then, it may be a challenge to figure out manipulation if traders/large prop desks are acting in concert to steer trades to their benefit."

"ITC, Nestle, other FMCG stocks drop up to 2%, extend losses to second day after 3-day rally",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/itc-nestle-other-fmcg-stocks-drop-up-to-2-extend-losses-to-second-day-after-3-day-rally-13480265.html,"The shares of major FMCG companies dropped on August 22, pushing the Nifty FMCG index down for the second consecutive session. This comes after the stocks recorded strong gains for three consecutive sessions on optimism over prospective GST reforms. Nifty FMCG index was down 1 percent to stand at 55,742.05, as seen at 1:05 pm. The index had gained nearly 4 percent between August 18 and August 20, after Prime Minister Narendra Modi hinted at the next generation of Goods and Services Tax (GST) reforms to be announced as a Diwali gift for consumers. Investors may have then resorted to profit booking after the strong spike in the sector. The Nifty FMCG index has dropped over 1.6 percent in two sessions. ITC and Colgate Palmolive shares dropped nearly 2 percent each, while Nestle India and Marico shares were down over 1 percent. Emami, United Breweries (UBL), Hindustan Unilever (HUL) and Britannia Industries shares were trading in the red with marginal losses. Bucking the trend, Varun Beverages, Tata Consumer Products, Radico Khaitan and Dabur shares were trading in the green with marginal gains, while Godrej Consumer Products were up more than 1 percent. In its latest report, Axis Securities noted that the FMCG sector r delivered modest single-digit topline growth in Q1FY26, largely driven by price hikes and improving sentiment in select urban pockets. “Unseasonal rains weighed on summer-led categories like beverages and glucose. Nonetheless, management commentary across companies reflects optimism, with most anticipating volume recovery over the next 2–3 quarters, supported by easing inflation and improving macro indicators,” the brokerage said. Axis Securities noted that urban markets, which contribute to nearly 50-60 percent of total FMCG sales, continue to face headwinds due to muted wage growth, higher EMIs, and stiff competition from emerging distribution formats like D2C and Q-commerce. However, rural demand remains robust despite macro headwinds. “Looking ahead, we maintain a constructive outlook for the FMCG sector. With rural inflation easing, higher MSPs, healthy monsoon projections, and increased government spending, we expect rural consumption to remain a key growth lever. Moreover, the upcoming quarters—particularly H2FY26 are expected to bring about a more broad-based volume recovery, fueled by seasonal tailwinds, improved consumer sentiment, and monetary policy support,” it added, while naming Varun Beverages and DOMS Industries as its top picks in the sector.

Accumulate Tata Motors; target of Rs 722: Deven Choksey,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/accumulate-tata-motors-target-of-rs-722-deven-choksey-13479525.html,"Deven Choksey's research report on Tata Motors Tata Motors’ consolidated revenue declined by 2.5% YoY (-12.6% QoQ) to INR 1,044.1bn, largely in-line with our estimates (-2.1%). The growth was majorly driven by improved product mix, partially offset weaker JLR and domestic volumes. Domestic dispatches fell sharply by 9.1% YoY (-18.2% QoQ) to 297,701 units due to muted demand, while JLR wholesale volume witnessed a decline of 10.7% YoY to 87,286 units, as it was severely impacted by US tariffs and model transitions. Outlook We have revised our FY26E/FY27E EBITDA estimates by -10.4%/-6.5% respectively, factoring weaker JLR margins and subdued domestic demand. We have roll-forwarded our valuation basis to Jun’27 estimates. We value Tata Motors on a SOTP basis, implying a target price of INR 722 per share. We maintain our “ACCUMULATE” rating on the stock.

Divis Laboratories stock jumps 3% as Citi says recent correction is a buying opportunity; 28% upside seen,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/divis-laboratories-stock-jumps-3-as-citi-says-recent-correction-is-a-buying-opportunity-28-upside-seen-13479383.html,"Shares of Divis Laboratories rose 3 percent to Rs 6,188 on Friday, August 22, after global brokerage Citi turned upbeat on the stock, flagging attractive valuations and sector tailwinds. Citi reiterated its buy call with a price target of Rs 7,750, implying nearly 28.5 percent upside from the last close of Rs 6,028 per share on the NSE. The brokerage said the recent weakness in the stock offers a good entry point, dismissing concerns around Orforglipron, Eli Lilly’s oral GLP-1 candidate. It noted that even with consensus sales estimates of over $15 billion by 2030, Divi’s is still positioned to clock $200–300 million in intermediate supplies. Follow our LIVE  blog for all the latest market updates Divi’s is expected to remain a critical API supplier for Entresto, which is the single-largest product in its Custom Synthesis portfolio. Brokerages estimate Entresto APIs contribute as much as 40 percent of Custom Synthesis revenue and nearly 20 percent of Divi’s consolidated topline. Last month, after MSN Laboratories won a US patent case that could allow a generic launch post-July 2025, IIFL had warned of potential earnings risks for Divi’s. For now, however, Citi sees the backdrop as favourable, with reasonable valuations and a healthy order pipeline supporting the stock. Citi also highlighted stronger uptake of Tirzepatide (a GLP-1 injection) as further evidence of rising demand in the peptide segment, a key market for Divi’s. On Entresto, Novartis’ blockbuster heart failure drug with annual sales of about $6 billion, Citi argued that investor concerns over a US generic entry may be overstated. It pointed out that Divi’s continues to supply APIs without disruption, suggesting little or no exposure to the US market. The Hyderabad-based pharmaceutical major reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 545 crore for the June 2025 quarter, a 26.7 percent increase over Rs 430 crore in the corresponding period last year. Revenue from operations came in at Rs 2,410 crore, higher by 13.8 percent compared with Rs 2,118 crore in Q1 FY25. Total income for the quarter stood at Rs 2,529 crore, against Rs 2,197 crore in the year-ago period. At about 11:45 am, shares of the company were trading at Rs 6,143, higher by 2 percent from the last close on the NSE. Divis Laboratories' stock price is down 8 percent over the last month.

The transaction, executed at Rs 7,850 a share, is about 1 percent below the previous day’s closing price, and was facilitated by Morgan Stanley India.

The promoter group said it remains fully focused on the growth of Apollo Hospitals, Apollo Health Co, and Apollo Health and Lifestyle, and has no plans to further reduce stake in the foreseeable future. The move comes amid growing investor scrutiny of promoter pledges and signals a strategic effort to strengthen the group’s financial position while maintaining long-term commitment to the business.

The sharp rise in the share prices pushed the Nifty India Defence index up nearly 1 percent to hover around 7,760.25. Russia launched one of its largest attacks on Ukraine, sending 574 drones and 40 missiles to the neighboring country, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. One person was killed and 22 were wounded in the overnight strikes, authorities said. According to Zelenskyy, a missile strike on a US-owned electronics firm was a ""telling"" indicator of Russian intentions in US-led peace initiatives. ""Now the signals from Russia are simply, to be honest, indecent. They are trying to back away from the need to hold meetings. They don't want to end the war. They carry on with massive strikes,"" he said in a video address. This comes after US President Donald Trump said earlier this week that there was an agreement for a bilateral meeting between Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Vladimir Putin now demands that Ukraine gives up all of the eastern Donbas region, renounce ambitions to join NATO, remain neutral and keep Western troops out of the country, Reuters reported citing sources. The Russian President met Donald Trump in Alaska last week for the first Russia-US summit in more than four years and spent almost all of their three-hour closed meeting discussing what a compromise on Ukraine might look like, the report further said. The defence stocks had earlier tumbled amid rising ceasefire talks and lack of fresh triggers. The fresh escalations in the Russia-Ukraine war may have re-boosted the stocks. DCX Systems shares rallied around 10.5 percent to trade at Rs 275.50 apiece. Solar Industries and Zen Technologies shares gained around 2 percent each. Astra Microwave Products, Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL), Bharat Electronics (BEL) and Paras Defence shares gained around 1 percent each, while Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers (GRSE), BEML and Bharat Dynamics (BDL) shares were trading in the green with marginal gains.

Urban infra lender Hudco likely to cross annual loan book guidance of Rs 1.5 lakh crore during Q3FY25,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/urban-infra-lender-hudco-likely-to-cross-annual-loan-book-guidance-of-rs-1-5-lakh-crore-during-q3fy25-13479184.html,"Hudco, a lender for government-backed housing and urban development projects, said the company is likely to cross its annual loan book guidance of Rs 1.5 lakh crore during Q3FY25, and could end up lending around Rs 1.55-1.60 lakh crore this fiscal, though the lender will review the guidance after the second quarter for any changes. ""...after Q2, we will be revisiting and we'll see that if the guidance needs to be changed. ...we will be crossing Rs 1.50 lakh crore may be in Q3 or sometime before that,"" said Hudco's CMD Sanjay Kulshrestha during the June quarter earnings call earlier this month. The lender has sanctioned over Rs 32,000 crore during the first quarter, with disbursement of around Rs 12,812 crore, which makes the sanction to disbursement ratio at around 35 percent. This disbursement amount is all-time high for the company, and Hudco said it is now targetting around 30 percent growth on full-year disbursement for FY25, which was Rs 40,000 crore. On YoY basis, Hudco's loan sanction has risen 143 percent during the June quarter to Rs 34,224 crore, with loan disbursement rising by 1.48 percent on year. For FY25, the disbursement has grown by 122 percent on year, while sanctions rose by 55 percent. Hudco said for the past 10 quarters, the lender has not recorded new NPAs and is moving towards being a 'zero NPA company', with net NPA down to slightly less than 0.1 percent. As of now, around one-third of Hudco's borrowing is based on floating rate and rest is fixed rate borrowing. ""Hudco is a company which is not agnostic to any sector, and we are funding to each and every sector. We are serving the requirement of state government. In some states, the roads may be the priority, but in other states, the river linking is a priority,"" chairman Sanjay Kulshrestha said. ""...we have started exploring new areas, new segments, new infrastructure segment. We had also explored new states and other entities...,"" the chairman added."

Its ability to leverage group cargo while steadily growing third-party volumes (52% in 1Q FY26) underlines its position in India’s port and logistics ecosystem. The company has reiterated that expanding port capacity remains a core priority, with plans to scale from 177MTPA today to 400MTPA by FY30. Alongside ports, JSWINFRA is pursuing an aggressive logistics infrastructure build-out under JSW Ports Logistics, supported by an investment plan of INR90b through FY30. This expansion is expected to deliver revenue of INR80b and EBITDA of INR20b at scale. Outlook We expect JSWINFRA to strengthen its market dominance, leading to a 13% volume CAGR over FY25-27E. This should drive a 22% CAGR in revenue and a 23% CAGR in EBITDA over the same period. We reiterate our BUY rating with a TP of INR380 (premised on 23x FY27 EV/EBITDA).

"Metal, real estate stocks drop up to 2% ahead of Fed chief Powell's Jackson Hole speech",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/metal-real-estate-stocks-drop-up-to-2-ahead-of-fed-chief-powell-s-jackson-hole-speech-13479158.html,"The shares of metal and real estate companies tumbled on August 22, pushing the two sectoral indices into the red sharply. This comes ahead of US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's speech at the annual Jackson Hole symposium. The Nifty Metal index declined over 0.7 percent to stand at 9,424, while the Nifty Realty index fell more than 0.5 percent to hover around 912, as seen at 10.20 am. The American central bank is holding its annual symposium from August 21 to August 23 in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak on the economic outlook and central bank's policy framework on Friday. US President Donald Trump has criticised Powell multiple times for not cutting rates. In a Truth Social post, Trump referred to Powell as ""Jerome ‘Too Late’ Powell"" and accused him of not acting promptly to reduce interest rates. He also stated that Powell is ""hurting"" the housing industry ""very badly"" and reiterated his call for a cut in key interest rates. Most investors now expect a 25-basis-point Fed rate cut next month. A rate cut in the US could reduce borrowing costs for foreign investors, encouraging them to invest in higher growth markets in India. This boosts real estate and metal stocks. Additionally, investors expect the RBI to follow Fed in the pursuit of a rate cut, if any. This too can further impact the stocks. JSW Steel and Jindal Steel & Power shares dropped over 1.3 percent each, while Steel Authority of India (SAIL) and Hindustan Zinc shares fell more than 1 percent each. Adani Enterprises, Hindustan Copper, Tata Steel and National Aluminium Company (NALCO) shares fell nearly 1 percent each, while Hindalco, Vedanta and Welspun Corp shares were down with marginal losses. Raymond shares were the top loser on the realty index, dropping nearly 2 percent to trade at Rs 622 apiece. Oberoi Realty, Macrotech Developers (Lodha), DLF and Anant Raj shares fell nearly 1 percent each, while Phoenix Mills, Brigade Enterprises and Godrej Properties shares were down marginally in the red."

"Vodafone Idea shares jump 7% after report says PMO to take a call on relief measures; should you buy, sell or hold?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/vodafone-idea-shares-jump-4-after-report-says-pmo-to-take-a-call-on-relief-measures-should-you-buy-sell-or-hold-13478975.html,"The shares of Vodafone Idea (Vi) closed over 7 percent higher at Rs 7.02 apiece on August 22 after a report by Mint said that the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) is set to take a call on a relief proposal for the telecom major. The shares of the company were trading at Rs 7.13 apiece in the afternoon. Earlier during the day, the stock had rallied nearly 12 percent to hit an intraday high of Rs 7.31 apiece. PMO had received an informal note from the Department of Telecommunication (DoT), proposing multiple relief options for the debt-ridden telecom company, Mint reported citing people familiar with the matter. These options include another two-year pause on paying the statutory dues under moratorium currently. The PMO will take the decision on whether these relief measures are to be extended, said the Mint report cited a source as saying. DoT has also proposed to give Vodafone Idea more time to repay dues, smaller annual payouts, and a waiver on penalties and interest penalties on AGR payment, the report added. Moneycontrol couldn't independently verify the report. Vodafone Idea has been struggling with dues, owing about Rs 83,400 crore in adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues, with annual payments of nearly Rs 18,000 crore scheduled from March 2025. Its overall dues to the government stand at around Rs 2 trillion including penalty and interest, Mint said. The debt-laden operator has repeatedly warned it cannot survive without funding support, as banks remain wary of lending given its financial stress. Vi employs over 18,000 people and has nearly 198 million subscribers. Telecom service provider Vodafone Idea (Vi) is exploring non-bank avenues to fund its capital expenditure plans, as negotiations with lenders remain stalled due to uncertainty over adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues, outgoing CEO Akshaya Moondra said on August 18 during the June quarter earnings call. Vi has also formally urged the government to settle the AGR matter ahead of the March 2026 deadline, which Moondra said would help reassure banks and unlock financing support. ""Given the fact that we are keen on maintaining a continuity of our capex, which has been going on since last year, we are looking at non-banking sources of funding, also not the full amount of Rs 25,000 crore that we have talked about, but a lesser amount so that we can continue with the capex cycle,"" Moondra said. Should you buy, sell or hold? Motilal Oswal recommended a 'Sell' rating for the stock, with a target price of Rs 6 per share. This implies a downside potential of more than 8 percent from the previous closing price of Rs 6.55 per share. “We cut our FY27-28E revenue and EBITDA estimates by ~4-5% each, driven by higher subscriber declines. We reiterate our SELL rating on Vi with a revised TP of INR6, based on DCF implied ~12.5x Sep’27E EV/EBITDA,” the domestic brokerage said. ICICI Securities kept a 'Hold' rating for the stock, with a target price of Rs 7 per share. This implies an upside potential of nearly 7 percent from the previous closing price. “VIL has funding to incur elevated capex only till Q2FY26; its future capex is dependent on closing the funding arrangement which has been in the process for a while. VIL is also hopeful of a resolution on AGR matter before its first EMI due in Mar’26, remains critical for establishing its going concern status,” the brokerage noted.

"Markets snap 6-day rally: Sensex down 400 pts, Nifty below 25,000 as bank, metal, IT stocks drag",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/markets-snap-6-day-rally-sensex-down-400-pts-nifty-below-25-000-as-bank-metal-it-stocks-drag-13478724.html,"Benchmark indices Nifty and Sensex were off to a weak start, snapping their 6-day gaining streak on Friday, August 22, as investors booked profit at elevated levels. Auto, bank, metal and IT stocks were the big drags while the broader market mirrored weak trends to edge lower. At about 9:40 am, the Sensex was down 396.99 points or 0.48 percent at 81,603.72, and the Nifty was down 127.65 points or 0.51 percent at 24,956.10. About 1246 shares advanced, 1661 shares declined, and 135 shares were unchanged. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates ""The six-day rally in equities could run into resistance as Trump’s proposed tariffs loom large. If the 25 percent levy takes effect in August—as now seems likely—the drag on India’s growth could exceed the earlier 20–30 basis point estimates based on reciprocal tariffs. Markets will have to price in that risk,"" V K Vijayakumar of Geojit Investments Ltd said. ""However, a key development has been the relative strength of largecaps, a trend that appears both justified and sustainable, he added. At the open, sectoral trends were mixed. Pharma, media, energy and consumer durables posted modest gains, while FMCG and realty were flat. On the other hand, metals, banks, IT, oil & gas and autos were under pressure, dragging broader indices lower. The India VIX inched up 2.1 percent, signalling some uptick in market volatility. Midcap and smallcap indices also opened in the red. Among individual stocks, Apollo Hospitals Enterprises fell 1 percent to Rs 7,852 in morning deals on August 22 after Suneeta Reddy, promoter and managing director of the company, offloaded 1.32 percent of her holding in the healthcare major through a block transaction, Bloomberg data showed. The deal, involving approximately 18.97 lakh shares, is valued at Rs 1,489 crore and has a floor price of Rs 7,850 per share. FMCG bellwether, Hindustan Unilever, traded in the red after it announced a leadership transition, appointing Niranjan Gupta as its next Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and member of the Management Committee. Gupta will take charge as CFO and Executive Director, Finance from November 1, 2025, succeeding Ritesh Tiwari, who has been elevated as Global Head of M&A and Treasury at Unilever Plc. Technical View Nifty’s broader structure remains constructive, with higher lows indicating persistent buying interest. The near-equal positioning of both call and put writers highlights the possibility of a consolidation phase, but a sustained move above 25,150 could unlock the next leg higher towards 25,250, likely forcing call writers into short covering. Support zones have shifted higher, with 24,850–25,000 now emerging as the key demand area. Firm positioning by put writers at lower strikes further strengthens the positive outlook. Unless the index decisively breaches 24,850, bulls are expected to hold the upper hand. For now, a “buy-on-dips” strategy remains the most prudent approach, with traders watching closely for a breakout above 25,150 to confirm the next leg of upside momentum. L&T, Bajaj Finance, M&M, Jio Financial Services, and Cipla were the top gainers on the Nifty. SBI Life Insurance, Grasim, Hero MotoCorp, Asian Paints, and HCL Tech were the major laggards.

Q1FY26 operating revenue surged 55% YoY to ₹3,131.7 cr, driven by strong performance in the Wind Turbine Generator (WTG) segment, which delivered 444 MW, marking a 62% YoY increase. OMS division posted a modest 10% YoY revenue growth for the quarter, while the Forging division surged 60% YoY to ₹146.49 cr. Suzlon’s share in Forging rose from 40% to 62%, driven by strong order execution. Gross profit rose 58% YoY, even as raw material costs jumped 85%, driven by effective price pass-through strategies that helped maintain profitability. Higher capacity utilization in the WTG and forging business, led to stronger operating leverage. As a result, EBITDA reached ₹599.07 cr, with a margin expansion of 82.3 bps. Profit before tax (PBT) grew 52% YoY to ₹459.23 cr. However, a ₹134 cr deferred tax charge led to higher tax expenses, moderating the growth in profit after tax (PAT), which stood at ₹324.32 cr, up 7% YoY over a high base. Outlook Suzlon’s ALMM compliance and backward integration offer a strong competitive moat, but sustaining margin discipline remains key to preserving pricing power. Factoring in execution risks, we revise our valuation multiple to 35x (from 38x earlier) FY27E EPS of ₹2.2 to arrive at a target price of ₹75, upgrading our rating to a BUY recommendation.

At 8:10 am, the Gift Nifty slipped 80 points, or 0.32 percent, to 25,041, hinting at a softer start for Dalal Street on Friday, August 22. Indices gained on Thursday, lifted by pharma, oil & gas and banking stocks. The midcap and smallcap index, however, broke their three-day rally to end lower, while weakness in autos, FMCG and PSU banks also capped the upside. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Foreign investors (FIIs/FPIs) pumped Rs 1,247 crore into Indian equities on Thursday, August 21. At the same time, domestic institutional investors (DIIs) sustained their support with net purchases of Rs 2,546 crore, according to provisional exchange data. Here are the important levels to watch out for in today’s session. Nifty’s broader structure remains constructive, with higher lows indicating persistent buying interest. The near-equal positioning of both call and put writers highlights the possibility of a consolidation phase, but a sustained move above 25,150 could unlock the next leg higher towards 25,250, likely forcing call writers into short covering. Support zones have shifted higher, with 24,850–25,000 now emerging as the key demand area. Firm positioning by put writers at lower strikes further strengthens the positive outlook.

For now, a “buy-on-dips” strategy remains the most prudent approach, with traders watching closely for a breakout above 25,150 to confirm the next leg of upside momentum. “Nifty Bank index continues to struggle for strong directional momentum, with leading banking heavyweights yet to exhibit sustained strength. The immediate hurdle lies in the 55,800–56,000 zone, and only a decisive breakout above this band could unleash bullish momentum, powered by short covering. On the downside, dips toward 55,500 remain attractive accumulation opportunities, supported by firm put writing at lower strikes” Dhupesh Dhameja of SAMCO Securities said. “However, a breach below 55,450 would be an early sign of weakness, opening the doors for a slide toward the 55,000 mark. Until then, sideways movement is expected to dominate”, he added. India VIX slipped 3.50 percent to settle at 11.37. Despite lingering global uncertainties, volatility remains subdued, hinting at a consolidation phase rather than sharp corrections. The muted VIX reading underscores cautious optimism among market participants, with no signs of heightened fear. The Put-Call Ratio (PCR) has eased slightly from 1.34 to 1.01, yet continues to reflect the dominance of put writers and a bullish-to-sideways sentiment in the market.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade DMart, Can Fin Homes, Radico Khaitan, Cipla, Dr Reddys Labs, Caplin Point, Afcons Infra, and others on August 22?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-dmart-can-fin-homes-radico-khaitan-cipla-dr-reddys-labs-caplin-point-afcons-infra-and-others-on-august-22-13478046.html,"Bulls continued to hold the fort despite pressure from bears, helping the Nifty 50 close 0.13 percent higher on August 21, while the market breadth was nearly balanced. Around 1,381 shares declined compared to 1,350 advancing shares on the NSE. Overall, the trend remains favourable for bulls, despite the likelihood of intermittent consolidation. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Jay Mehta, Technical Research at JM Financial Services Afcons Infrastructure | CMP: Rs 427.8  Afcons Infrastructure had been trading in a descending triangle pattern since March 2025, hitting a low of around Rs 398 post-listing. It retested this level on April 7 and recently experienced a false breakdown below it on July 29, forming a hammer candlestick. The stock has now broken out above the triangle pattern, with an upside Tasuki candlestick pattern observed recently. Volume has increased positively in the past few sessions, with over 60% average delivery volume. The price is trading above its 20- and 50-day EMAs, and the price action aligns with RSI, showing a higher high and higher low structure in the short-to-medium term. Momentum indicators support a bullish outlook. The ADX trend indicator indicates fading bearish momentum, with bullish strength increasing as DMI+ trades above DMI- and ADX trends upward. A break above Rs 447 could accelerate the rally. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 465, Rs 484 Stop-Loss: Rs 405 Avenue Supermarts | CMP: Rs 4,691.9  DMart had been in a triangular consolidation pattern since April 2025, with below-average volume indicating an accumulation phase. On August 18, it broke out above the pattern with a breakaway gap, signaling renewed buying interest. The price is trading above all key EMAs, and the breakout is backed by positive volume buildup. Momentum indicators reflect a bullish bias, supporting an upward trend toward Rs 4,900 and Rs 5,166. A minor correction to the Rs 4,440–4,550 support zone could offer a buying opportunity. The ADX trend indicator suggests continued bullish momentum, with DMI+ trading above DMI-. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 4,900, Rs 5,166 Stop-Loss: Rs 4,126 Can Fin Homes | CMP: Rs 782.1  After correcting from a swing high of Rs 826, Can Fin Homes formed a base near its 200EMA, consolidating in a tight range for about 14 days. It recently broke out above this range with a surge in positive volume and strong delivery volume in recent sessions. The price is now trading above all key EMAs, which should act as support during minor dips. Momentum indicators support a bullish bias, with RSI trading above 50 and the MACD histogram rising. The ADX trend indicator shows fading prior bearish momentum, with bullish strength increasing as DMI+ trades above DMI-. Also, when comparing the relative move of peers in the housing finance space, Can Fin Homes is showing good relative strength. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 820, Rs 850 Stop-Loss: Rs 750 Mandar Bhojane, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst at Choice Broking Radico Khaitan | CMP: Rs 2,894.8  Radico Khaitan is consolidating just above its breakout level, indicating strength and the potential for a fresh breakout. The move is supported by strong volume participation, reflecting rising bullish interest. A decisive close above Rs 2,900 would confirm the breakout and could pave the way for a fresh upside rally. On the downside, immediate support is placed at Rs 2,850, which also acts as a strong accumulation zone for traders looking to enter on dips. The RSI stands at 62.34 and is trending upward, signaling improving momentum and increasing buying pressure. From a risk–reward perspective, traders may consider keeping a stop-loss at Rs 2,785 to manage downside risk. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,100, Rs 3,200 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,785 Swiggy | CMP: Rs 435.7  Swiggy has given a decisive breakout from a Cup and Handle formation on the daily chart, supported by strong volumes. This indicates that bulls are regaining control and a trend shift is already underway. The momentum outlook remains positive, with the RSI at 67.62 and trending upward, signaling growing strength while still staying below the overbought zone. The Rs 425 level is acting as a strong base and offers a buy-on-dips opportunity for traders. With price action holding above the breakout zone, the stock looks poised for further upside. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 505, Rs 540 Stop-Loss: Rs 407.5 Cipla | CMP: Rs 1,592.8  Cipla has recently broken out of a Symmetrical Triangle pattern on the daily chart. The breakout was backed by a strong bullish candle along with rising volumes, indicating renewed buying interest and a potential shift in trend in favour of the bulls. This price action highlights strength and the possibility of further upside in the stock. On the momentum front, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is placed at 65.9 and trending upward, suggesting growing bullish momentum. The Rs 1,570 level now serves as a strong support zone and could act as a buy-on-dips opportunity for positional traders. Sustaining above the breakout level with continued volume participation would likely open the door for higher levels in the coming sessions. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,700, Rs 1,790 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,525 Om Mehra, Technical Research Analyst at Samco Securities Dr Reddy's Laboratories | CMP: Rs 1,276.6  Dr Reddy’s Laboratories advanced in the latest session, breaking past the falling trendline resistance and closing above both the 20-SMA (Rs 1,245) and 50-SMA (Rs 1,270). This breakout from the recent consolidation phase suggests the stock is attempting to reverse its corrective trend. The daily RSI has improved to 58, indicating strengthening momentum with further scope before entering overbought territory. The MACD has turned positive, supported by a rising histogram, confirming that the short-term bias has tilted in favour of the bulls. The stock has formed a strong bullish candle on the daily chart backed by decent volumes, and is comfortably holding above the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement. On the downside, support is well-defined at Rs 1,255, aligned with the 50-SMA. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,345 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,245 Caplin Point Laboratories | CMP: Rs 2,211.10  Caplin Point Labs advanced 4.25% in the latest session, forming a strong bullish engulfing candle on the daily chart and decisively breaking out from a prolonged consolidation phase. The breakout was supported by a notable rise in volumes and followed weeks of sideways price action, where the stock had been coiling within a broad range. This move now signals a shift in momentum toward sustained upside. The daily RSI has improved to 62, confirming strengthening momentum while still leaving room before entering overbought territory. The MACD remains positive, while the hourly chart displays a higher high formation. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,320 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,140 Cummins India | CMP: Rs 3,886.30  Cummins India has staged a breakout from a well-defined saucer pattern, overcoming the prolonged resistance zone that had repeatedly capped the stock’s up move in recent months. This breakout is supported by a sequence of higher highs and higher lows, underscoring the strength of the ongoing uptrend. The stock continues to trade comfortably above its key moving averages, which are firmly sloping upward, providing a solid base for continuation. The RSI has climbed to 74, reflecting robust bullish momentum, though it is approaching overbought territory, which may invite brief consolidation phases. The MACD remains in positive territory with a widening histogram, confirming trend acceleration.

The official decision by the NSE Index sub-committee is expected on August 22. The index adjustments, effective September 29, 2025 will be closely watched as several passive funds that track the benchmark could see changes in their fund flow allocations. According to brokerages, healthcare service provider Max Healthcare could see an inflow $400 million and Indigo-parent InterGlobe Aviation may see an inflow of $600 million. The inclusions come at the expense of IndusInd Bank and Hero Moto, with the troubled lender likely to see an outflow of $230 million and the two-wheeler company could see $600 million in outflows. Read More Changes to the Nifty 50 benchmark index are made twice a year, in March and September by NSE, based on the average free-float market capitalisation of past six months. During the rejig in March this year, Zomato and Jio Financial Services entered the Nifty 50, replacing BPCL and Britannia Industries. This rejig had marked the inclusion of digital-era stocks, underscoring the rising importance of consumer tech and fintech players in the stock market.

Click to View More Outlook for August 22 Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The Nifty traded in a narrow range of 25,050–25,150 throughout the day, reflecting limited volatility. Sentiment remains positive, with the index comfortably holding above the short-term moving average. The daily RSI is in a bullish crossover and trending higher. On the downside, support is placed at 24,800; as long as this level holds, a buy-on-dips strategy is likely to prevail. On the upside, resistance is seen at 25,250 and 25,500. Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities Today, the benchmark indices witnessed narrow-range activity. The Nifty ends 33 points higher, while the Sensex was up by 143 points. Among sectors, Pharma and Healthcare indices gained nearly 1 percent, whereas the Capital Market index lost the most, shed over 2 percent. Technically, after a gap-up open, the market experienced range-bound activity throughout the day. On daily charts, it has formed a small candle, indicating indecisiveness between the bulls and the bears. We are of the view that, the larger market trend is upward, but for day traders, buying on intraday corrections and selling on rallies would be the ideal strategy. On the downside, 25,000/81700 and 24,950/81500 would act as key support zones, while 25,150/82300 and 25,250/82500 could be crucial resistance levels for the bulls. However, below 24,950/81500, the sentiment could change. If the index falls below this level, traders may prefer to exit long positions. Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets traded lackluster on the weekly expiry day and ended largely unchanged amid mixed cues. After a flat start, the Nifty moved in a narrow range throughout the session before settling at 25,080. Sectoral performance was mixed, with gains in pharma, realty, and financials, while FMCG, energy, and auto witnessed profit-taking. The broader indices also remained subdued, closing flat to marginally lower. Overall sentiment, however, stayed constructive, with stock-specific moves driving the market. Investors are closely tracking developments around recent discussions and approvals on GST reforms, which are prompting sector-specific reactions. In addition, global cues remain in focus, particularly the Jackson Hole symposium, where commentary from central bankers could influence sentiment. The IT space, in particular, may witness further rebound once clarity emerges on the global policy outlook. Amid this backdrop, we maintain a positive view on the market but advise traders to focus on selective opportunities arising from rotational buying across sectors. At the same time, it is prudent to avoid aggressive positioning in the broader indices and adopt a stock-specific approach in the near term. Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities Nifty continued to move higher on Thursday amidst choppy movement and closed the day with gains of 33 points. After opening on a positive note, the market moved up further in the early part of the session. Nifty failed to breach above 25150 levels and later shifted into a narrow range movement till the end. A small red candle was formed on the daily chart after surpassing the hurdle of down sloping trend line at 25050 levels. Technically this market action indicates lack of strength to witness decisive upside breakout. This could be considered as a short term breather in the market amidst uptrend. The overall uptrend of Nifty remains intact, but short term consolidation or minor weakness can't be ruled out in the next 1-2 sessions before surging higher towards next hurdle of 25300. Immediate support is placed at 25000 levels. Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Trouble continued for Nazara Technologies' stock, which tumbled another 8 percent, after the Lok Sabha passed the Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Bill, 2025. The bill aims to prohibit all pay-to-play online games, including both games of skill and chance. If passed, the bill would pause the total operations of regulated real-money gaming (RMG) platforms across India. Shares of Ola Electric Mobility tumbled more than 8 percent on August 21 following a massive 30 percent rise over two sessions, after the latest data from VAHAN portal showed rival electric two-wheeler maker Ather Energy nudging ahead on total monthly registrations so far in August, likely prompting some investors to book profits. According to the VAHAN portal, Ola Electric recorded 9,681 registrations in August so far, lower than the 10,283 registrations recorded by rival EV player Ather Energy. Read more: Need to increase tenure of equity derivatives in consultation with stakeholders: Sebi's Tuhin Kanta Pandey Technical View Yesterday’s rally lost steam as the Nifty stalled near 25,096, the initial upside target set for the session. The index is now hovering close to the upper Bollinger Band, a technical signal that suggests consolidation could be on the cards. This makes the path toward the higher objectives of 25,156–25,200 less certain in the near term. While a sharp collapse looks unlikely, traders may need to brace for dips toward 25,000–24,977 or even lower before the market attempts another leg higher. Such pullbacks, if they occur, could offer a healthier base for the next upswing. Cipla, Dr Reddy's, ICICI Bank, Bajaj Finserv, and SBI Life Insurance were the top gainers on the Nifty. Laggards on the index were Bajaj Auto, Coal India, Tata Consumer Products, Power Grid Corp, Eternal, and IndusInd Bank.

Operating loss stood at INR587m (PQ: operating profit of INR251m). Total borrower count declined ~18% QoQ to 2m. Opex rose ~10% YoY to ~INR2.1b (inline), resulting in a cost-income ratio of ~140% (PY: ~40% and PQ: ~90%). Credit costs stood at ~INR4.2b, resulting in annualized credit costs (as a % of average loans) of ~34% (PQ: ~36% and PY: ~8%). Technical write-offs stood at INR5.8b (vs. INR6.5b in 4QFY25). As a prudent measure, the company recognized additional credit costs of INR1.3b for the quarter due to technical write-off. Excluding this, impairment costs would have been INR2.9b. Recovery from the 90dpd account was INR410m in 1QFY26 (vs. INR520m in 4QFY25). Spandana indicated that disbursements in Jul’25 were nearly equivalent to the total disbursements in 1QFY26, with momentum strengthening further in Aug’25 as MTD-Aug’25 was tracking better than the corresponding period run-rate in July. Management anticipates a significant acceleration in both AUM and disbursement growth from 2HFY26, even as 2Q is still expected to remain challenging. Outlook We model AUM to decline ~20% in FY26 and expect profitability only in FY27 now. We expect credit costs for SPANDANA to remain elevated in 2QFY26, with AUM growth likely to remain subdued in FY26. While there are no nearterm catalysts, we reiterate our BUY rating on the stock with a TP of INR280 (based on 1.1x Mar’27E P/BV), given that SPANDANA now trades at an undemanding valuation of 0.9x Mar’27E P/BV.

Pricing pressure was also evident as realization was down 1.3% YoY to Rs12.3 per KG. Given stiff competition, we expect volume and realization CAGR of 4%/1% over FY25-FY27E. However, EBITDA margin is expected to improve 290 bps over the next 2 years amid improvement in utilization levels to 84% by FY27E.

DN’s Q1FY26 adjusted revenue stood at Rs18.7bn, declining to 13.6% YoY and 7% QoQ. Operating performance was impacted by ongoing pricing pressure, oversupply from China, and a decline in spreads. The Advanced Intermediates segment witnessed stable volumes across most products, except agrochemical intermediates, which were affected. The Phenols segment reported steady volumes, but profitability remained subdued due to an influx of cheap imports. Going forward, spreads in the phenolics segment are expected to see some uptick. Projects such as CNA and Hydrogenation were commercialized during the quarter. WNA and the R&D centre are expected to be commissioned in Q2FY26, while Nitration, MIKB, and MIBC projects are likely to come online in H2FY26. The total planned capex for the polycarbonate value chain stands at Rs85bn; however, the management’s guidance of only Rs8bn-10bn capex for FY26 suggests the polycarbonate resin project is unlikely to be commissioned by Dec’27 as previously guided. Outlook DN has been undertaking numerous growth initiatives, primarily in the Phenolics segment. While domestic demand for all products is expected to remain robust, the threat of cheap imports will likely keep margins under pressure. The agrochemicals business is expected to continue facing headwinds in the near term. The stock is currently trading at ~31x FY27 EPS. We upgrade to ‘HOLD’ rating.

Buy Vinati Organics; target of Rs 2091: Prabhudas Lilladher,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-vinati-organics-target-of-rs-2091-prabhudas-lilladher-13472585.html,"Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Vinati Organics Due to the recent correction in stock performance along with strong visibility from ATBS, new product ramp-up, and capacity expansion, we upgraded Vinati Organics (VO IN) to ‘BUY’ with a target price of Rs2,091, valuing the stock at 40x FY27 EPS. The company reported revenue of Rs5.4bn in Q1FY26, reflecting a modest 3.3% YoY increase but a sharp 16% sequential decline. Management has guided for ~15% revenue growth in FY26, led by an expected 20% increase in volumes, with EBITDA margins projected at ~27%. ATBS, the company’s flagship high-margin product, continued to deliver robust growth and remains oversold, likely to be supported by rising demand from the oil & gas sector where it is used as a tertiary oil recovery agent. Phase I of the ATBS capacity expansion has been completed, while Phase II is scheduled to come online in April’26. In the Antioxidants (AOs) segment, demand remains healthy though pricing pressure persists due to competition from China and Singapore. New products such as MEHQ and Guaiacol did not contribute meaningfully in Q1, but are expected to ramp up in FY26, with a combined peak revenue potential of ~Rs4bn. Outlook Additionally, upcoming product launches including anisole, 4MAP, TAA, and PTAP, expected in Q2FY26 and Q3FY26 are likely to strengthen the growth trajectory. We upgraded the stock to ‘BUY’. The stock is currently trading at 32x FY27 EPS.

""The EoI part of the process has been fully completed, the qualified parties have been through a provisional fit and proper assessment by the RBI. They are now doing the due diligence, and all details have been made available through the data room. We are in an advanced stage of completing the due diligence exercise and further steps, essentially the RFP stage, we hope to complete by the end of the financial year,"" Arunish Chawla told CNBC-TV18 during an interaction. DIPAM said all necessary details relating to the divestment have been shared with the qualified bidders, and the technical document for the divestment is ready now. The stake sale process, which is likely to conclude this fiscal, includes divestment of LIC's stake in the lender. Centre has already completed Rs 20,000 crore worth of divestment during Q1FY26 out of the targetted Rs 47,000 crore for the fiscal. The IDBI Bank stake sale, after multiple delays, is moving forward and is considered as key to government's broader divestment strategy. The government and the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) jointly own 95 percent of IDBI Bank, of which 60.72 percent stake is earmarked for sale under the ongoing disinvestment programme. The Centre has been working on the share purchase agreement with potential buyers and will be seeking approval from the ministerial panel overseeing the deal. IDBI Bank shares have surged 27 percent year-to-date, vastly outperforming the Nifty 50 index’s 5.5 percent rise."

According to the VAHAN portal, Ola Electric recorded 9,681 registrations in August so far, lower than the 10,283 registrations recorded by rival EV player Ather Energy.

Earlier this week, founder and chairman Bhavish Aggarwal laid out an ambitious growth strategy at the company’s annual Sankalp event. Ola is aiming for a 25-30 percent share in India's two-wheeler electric vehicle market, backed by vertical integration and new product launches. ""Our target market share for two-wheeler EVs is about 25 to 30 percent with very high margins, so we believe we are on the trajectory again,"" Aggarwal said. He added that Ola's 'mojo is still there' despite the challenges faced during its transition phase. Aggarwal also stressed that profitability in electric vehicles requires more than just scale. “No one is making money. To make money with EVs, you need vertical integration, you need the technology development, you need the DNA of technology,” Aggarwal said. Ola Electric reported a weak first quarter compared to last year, though results were better when compared sequentially. The electric two-wheeler maker posted a consolidated net loss of Rs 428 crore in Q1FY26 as against a loss of Rs 870 crore in Q4FY25 and Rs 347 crore in Q1FY25. Revenue for the quarter fell to Rs 828 crore, marking a 49.6 percent year-on-year (YoY) decline from Rs 1,644 crore.

This adjustment leads to an increased price target of Rs 1,162 from our previous target of Rs 793, resulting in an upside of 22% from current levels. Hence, we upgrade our rating to BUY.

Sell Vodafone Idea; target of Rs 6: Motilal Oswal,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/sell-vodafone-idea-target-of-rs-6-motilal-oswal-13475453.html,"Motilal Oswal's research report on Vodafone Idea Vodafone Idea’s (Vi) reported EBITDA declined 1% QoQ (vs.3%/5% QoQ for Bharti India Wireless/RJio), ~1% above our estimates, as lower network opex (+1% QoQ) was offset by higher SG&A costs (+8% QoQ). Operationally, subscriber losses moderated further to a modest 0.5m (vs. - 1.6m in 4Q), while ARPU inched up 0.6% QoQ to INR165 (+13% YoY, in line). Vi continued to lose market share as wireless revenue remained flat QoQ (+6% YoY, in line), compared to ~3% QoQ growth for peers. Outlook We cut our FY27-28E revenue and EBITDA estimates by ~4-5% each, driven by higher subscriber declines. We reiterate our SELL rating on Vi with a revised TP of INR6, based on DCF implied ~12.5x Sep’27E EV/EBITDA.

After a 17% correction in the share price over the last 12M, valuations at 11x FY27 P/E appear relatively reasonable, even as the long-term project pipeline continues to build up, supported by an expanding footprint in nuclear, PSP, renewables, and green chemicals. However, we maintain a cautious view on execution, especially at NGEL, even though management has guided that 87/80% of capacity slated to be commissioned in FY26/27 already has PPAs tied up. Further, we believe valuations for NGEL (15% of our SOTP) have little room for re-rating and may continue to face pressure. Lastly, we believe the FY27E dividend yield of 2.9% remains modest and lower than peers such as PWGR (FY27: 3.4%). Outlook Our TP of INR380 for NTPC is based on: Value of INR219 for the standalone, coal, and other businesses at Mar’27E P/B of 2.2x. Value of INR19 for other subsidiaries and INR53 for JV/associates at Mar’27E P/B of 2.0x.

The Union Cabinet has approved INR300b in LPG compensation to OMCs, which will be paid in 12 tranches. While the disbursement timeline remains undisclosed, we estimate IOCL to receive ~INR72b in both FY26/FY27 (48% of total compensation). This will result in a ~4% increase in IOCL’s FY27E BVPS. Outlook The stock trades at 13x consolidated FY27E EPS of INR10.7 and 0.9x FY27E P/B. We downgrade the stock to Neutral with a TP of INR150, valuing at 1x FY27EP/B.

While worries over sticky inflation are dragging Wall Street lower, Indian equities continue to hold firm, supported by bold reform measures and steady fund inflows. Softer retail inflation at 1.55 percent in July has also raised hopes of another rate cut by the MPC, though the RBI remains cautious amid global uncertainty,"" V K Vijayakumar of Geojit Investments Ltd said. He added that valuations, however, remain a key concern. Large-cap valuations appear justified by India’s long-term growth story, and midcaps are backed by healthy earnings momentum. But smallcaps look stretched, making them the riskiest segment of the market.

The smallcap and midcap indices also outperformed, advancing 0.7 percent and 0.3 percent, respectively. Among other gainers, metals added 0.4 percent, infrastructure 0.4 percent, IT 0.3 percent, and banking stocks posted modest gains, with the Nifty Bank and private bank indices higher by 0.3 percent each.

The target implies up to 22 percent upside potential from the current market price. Bajaj Finserv to benefit from lower rates, stronger BALIC (Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Company Limited) profits and BAGIC (Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Company Limited) growth, Jefferies said. Insurance players saw some cheer in trade on Thursday, August 21, after reports suggested that life and health insurance purchased by individuals may be exempt from the 18 percent Goods and Services Tax (GST) that is currently levied. The GST Group of Ministers (GoM) on insurance has proposed that health and life insurance premiums be exempted from the levy, in a move aimed at making insurance products more affordable and improving penetration in India’s underinsured market.
