"Auto shares fall from record highs on profit booking; Ashok Leyland, Tata Motors decline up to 3%",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/auto-shares-fall-from-record-highs-on-profit-booking-ashok-leyland-tata-motors-decline-up-to-3-13573325.html,"Auto stocks came under selling pressure on Wednesday as investors booked profits after the recent rally, dragging the Nifty Auto index down by around 1 percent. The index had closed 0.6 percent higher in the previous session on expectations of improved margins during the festive season. Auto shares had rallied in recent weeks after cuts in goods and services tax rates. Analysts also turned positive on the segment expecting higher sales volumes, as most automakers passed on the tax benefits to customers. Bharat Forge in the Nifty auto index led the decline, slipping about 3 percent. Shares of Tata Motors, Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto fell up to 2 percent. Tata Motors-owned Jaguar Land Rover has extended the closure of its factories until October 1 following a cyber attack earlier this month. The production halt is estimated to have led to a loss of around 30,000 units, according to ICICI Direct Research. Ashok Leyland dropped 2.6 percent after Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock to ""neutral"" from ""buy"", citing limited upside following sharp gains since mid-August. Tata Motors had earlier said its dealers retailed about 10,000 passenger vehicles on the first day of Navratri and recorded over 25,000 customer enquiries nationwide. Maruti Suzuki reported retail sales of around 30,000 units and Hyundai around 11,000 dealer billings on Monday, the latter marking its highest single-day sales in five years. Robust festive demand had lifted sentiment in the previous session, with the Nifty Auto index rising nearly 1.5 percent intraday on September 23. However, selling pressure was seen on Wednesday in line with headline indices amid sustained foreign fund outflows and global concerns, including proposed changes in the US H-1B visa system.

"IT stocks extend slide as US proposes to change H-1B visa process; Coforge, Tech Mahindra lead losses",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/it-stocks-extend-slide-as-us-proposes-to-change-h-1b-visa-process-coforge-tech-mahindra-lead-losses-13573296.html,"The shares of IT companies dropped in trade on September 24 after the US President Donald Trump-led administration proposed major changes to the H-1B visa process. The Nifty IT index dropped around 0.7 percent to 35,009.70, as seen as 10.20 am. This is the lowest level seen by the index in nearly two weeks. Top IT losers today: Coforge, Tech Mahindra, Mphasis and Persistent Systems shares dropped around 2 percent each, while Wipro shares fell over 1 percent each. LTIMindtree, Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) shares were down around 0.4 percent each. Bucking the trend, HCL Tech shares were trading nearly 1 percent higher in the green. What has Trump administration proposed? President Donald Trump-led US administration has proposed to scrap the lottery system and replace it with wage-based selection process for allotting H-1B visas. The new proposal by the Department of Homeland Security aims at bringing in ""a weighted selection process that would generally favour the allocation of H-1B visas to higher-skilled and higher-paid aliens, while maintaining the opportunity for employers to secure H-1B workers at all wage levels"". The new process, if finalised, would give heavier weight to applications by employers who pay high wages if annual requests for the visas exceed the statutory limit of 85,000, the notice said as quoted by Reuters. The move aims to better protect Americans from unfair wage competition from foreign workers, it said. US to hike fee for fresh H-1B visa applications: This comes after Trump recently announced that the US will introduce a $100,000 fee for fresh H-1B visa applications, an unprecedented increase from the earlier fee range of $215-$5,000, depending on the company size. This move had earlier sent the IT stocks to a spin, after a brief rise following US Federal Reserve's rate cut. Notably, India was the largest beneficiary of H-1B visas last year, accounting for 71 percent of the approved beneficiaries, while China was a distant second at 11.7 percent, according to government data cited by Reuters. What analysts say? The proposal to scrap the lottery system and introduce wage-based selection process could hurt fresher hiring particularly, with startups and Indian IT firms seen as most impacted, says ICICI Securities. The brokerage believes Indian IT companies will partially mitigate it through offshore hiring, local hiring and near shoring. ""IT companies have reduced their dependence on H-1B visas in recent years via local hiring and nearshoring, and the moderation in fresh H-1B visas is a testimony to this. Expect further downtrend from CY25 base in the coming years, in our view. On-site presence is a client requirement, and we do not rule out negotiations by IT companies with clients to bear either partial or full incremental visa costs going forward. There is also a possibility of more offshoring hereon, as only mission critical resources will opt for H-1B. Our sensitivity analysis suggests 5.8%/8.4% worst case impact on earnings for mid-caps/large caps,"" said Elara Capital.

KVB has conducted a thorough review of its SME portfolio. The overall Exposure at Impact (EAI) for all industries’ export to US is ~1.2% of the overall loans.  Further, exposure to US, where US contributes to over 60% of annual turnover, is contained at 0.56% of the total loans. Within this, textile exposure (above 60% export to US) stands lower at ~0.3% of the loans. In our view, the first order impact appears manageable.

SN Subrahmanyan, Chairman & Managing Director, L&T said the collaboration with BEL is a 'significant leap' in its commitment to India's defence manufacturing. ""We are honoured to be working with BEL to deliver next-generation technologies for the Indian Air Force. Both the organisations are leaders in our respective domains and our combined efforts will play a crucial role in bolstering national security and advancing self-reliance in defence technologies.""

With L&T’s engineering and systems integration capabilities and BEL’s expertise in defence electronics, we are confident of delivering a world-class solution that will serve the Indian Air Force for decades to come."" About AMCA The AMCA programme is aimed at developing an Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft, India’s indigenous fifth-generation, twin-engine, multi-role stealth fighter, through industry partnership - by DRDO's Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) - for subsystems, avionics, and other components. “Under the AMCA project, the plan is to develop five prototypes, which will be followed by series production. It is a key milepost in the history of the Make-in-India programme,” Defence Minister Rajnath Singh had said in May 2025 during the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) Annual Business Summit. The Cabinet Committee on Security had approved the fighter jet programme in 2024 with an initial development cost estimated at around Rs 15,000 crore. Some news reports had previously said that India will join hands with France under a government-to-government deal to jointly design and manufacture a new 120 kilonewton (KN) engine for the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA). The fifth gen fighter aircraft is being aimed to for an induction into IAF by 2036. Among the latest fifth generation fighter jets are the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor and Lockheed Martin F-35 (USA), Sukhoi T-50 PAK FA/Sukhoi Su-57 (Russia) and Chengdu J-20 (China). Year of Reforms The Ministry of Defence has declared 2025 as the ‘Year of Reforms’, with a focus on laying the foundation foradvancements in defence preparedness, and to transform the Armed Forces into a technologically advanced force capable of multi-domain and integrated operations. In light of the strain on global defence supply chains due to geopolitical conflicts, and Trump's tariffs, the cost for defence contractors have increased, leading to delays in production and maintenance. The government to keen to build a more resilient supply chain of products and components, with an emphasis on indigenisation. The Centre has set a target for domestic defence production at Rs 1.60 lakh crore for FY26 and Rs 3 lakh crore by FY29. The budget for Defence has seen an increase of around 4.5 percent FY26, taking the overall budget to Rs 1.80 lakh crore, of which Rs 1.49 lakh crore is planned to be spent on capital acquisition to modernise the forces.  Rs 1.12 lakh crore have been earmarked for domestic industry, and about Rs 15,000 crore has been earmarked for R&D projects todevelop new technologies along with private industry."

"Shipping poised for major Atmanirbhar push as Cabinet may weigh three schemes worth Rs 70,000 crore",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/shipping-poised-for-major-atmanirbhar-push-as-cabinet-may-weigh-three-schemes-worth-rs-70-000-crore-13573162.html,"The Union Cabinet is expected to take up three shipping sector schemes worth Rs 70,000 crore, CNBC Awaaz reported on September 24 citing people familiar with the development requesting anonymity. Select shares from the shipping sector, namely SCI, GRSE and Mazagon Dock are sharply higher in anticipation of further push by the government which has been increasingly looking to boost shipping and shipbuilding activities in India, both for domestic market as well as for exports. Among the schemes that have been in the news recently are a shipbuilding fund worth Rs 20,000 crore, a Rs 25,000 crore Maritime Development Fund which was announced during the Union Budget, and a shipbuilding financial assistance scheme of Rs 25,000 crore. The MDF is expected to have government's contribution at 49 percent while the rest will be from port authorities, PSUs, financial institutions as well as the private sector. These schemes are aimed to providing incentives, interest subsidies, and long-term finance to boost domestic shipbuilding, ship-breaking and port-linked infrastructure. The government has also been pushing for the development of greenfield clusters and expansion of existing shipping hubs. As part of this, Cochin Shipyard (CSL) on September 23 signed an agreement with HD Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering (HD KSOE) for a collaboration in shipbuilding. CSL is also considering developing a Rs 15,000 crore shipyard in Tamil Nadu that will result the creation of 10,000 jobs. MoS for Ports and Shipping, Shantanu Thakur had recently said that the Centre is planning to develop more shipyards and is looking to target 5 percent share of global shipbuilding market by 2030. ""We are targeting a 5 percent share in the global shipbuilding market by 2030, a significant leap from our current position. This will be achieved through strategic investments in automation, digital twin technology and green shipbuilding innovations,"" MoS for Ports and Shipping had said on September 15 during a CII conference. The government plans to develop ""10 world-class shipyards by 2030, supported by public-private partnerships and international collaborations that will bring global best practices to Indian shores."" Bloomberg News too had reported citing people familiar with the development that the Centre also has plans to rollout incentives worth Rs 4,000 crore to support India's shipbreaking industry. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had proposed to set up a Maritime Development Fund (MDF) for financial assistance, via equity or debt securities. With an initial corpus of Rs 25,000 crore, MDF will have government's contribution at 49 percent while the rest will be from port authorities, PSUs, financial institutions as well as the private sector. The government recently accorded infrastructure status to “large ships"", on September 19, after Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced the proposal during the Budget speech. “‘Large ships’ are included in the harmonised master list of infrastructure sub-sectors by insertion of a new item in the category of ‘Transport and Logistics’,” the finance ministry’s gazette notification said."

Indian equities seen opening on a weak note; rupee hits record low,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/indian-equities-seen-opening-on-a-weak-note-rupee-hits-record-low-13572190.html,"Indian markets are set to open marginally lower on Wednesday, tracking soft cues from Gift Nifty. At 7 am, Gift Nifty was trading 40 points down at 25,200, a decline of 0.16 percent. On September 23, domestic benchmarks ended slightly in the red as worries over a steep hike in H-1B visa fees, persistent FII outflows, and uncertainty around India–US trade talks weighed on sentiment. A weak August PMI print, lower than the previous month, further dented investor confidence. The rupee slipped to a fresh record low of 88.7 against the US dollar, pressured by visa fee concerns and trade policy uncertainty. However, markets staged a partial recovery, aided by supportive factors such as GST reforms, robust auto sales on the first day of GST 2.0, a normal monsoon, and core sector growth in August rising to a 13-month high. The Sensex ended 0.07 percent lower at 82,102, while the Nifty slipped 0.13 percent to 25,197.50. Sectorally, Nifty IT, FMCG, and Defence indices fell up to 1 percent, while Auto, PSU Bank, and Metal indices gained up to 1 percent. Metal shares outperformed after the Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) proposed a five-year anti-dumping duty on imports of cold-rolled non-oriented electrical steel from China. Across Asia, equities slipped on Wednesday, echoing Wall Street losses after US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that “equity prices are fairly highly valued.” Powell added that the Fed faces a “challenging situation” and offered no clarity on the rate-cut trajectory. Globally, investors are awaiting Friday’s release of the US personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge. Traders are also watching developments in Washington as the risk of a government shutdown looms, with lawmakers yet to reach a deal ahead of the September 30 funding deadline."
First Tick: Top global cues to watch in today’s trade,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/first-tick-top-global-cues-to-watch-in-today-s-trade-7-13571808.html,"Indian benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty are likely to see a weak opening today,  tracking GIFT Nifty, which was hovering around 25,203. Track the latest updates on GIFT Nifty right here on Moneycontrol. The Indian equity market ended flat with a negative bias on Tuesday, as gains in financials, autos, and metals were offset by losses in FMCG, IT, and select heavyweight stocks. Investors stayed cautious through a volatile session marked by currency weakness, FII outflows, and global policy concerns, even as selective buying in large banks, steelmakers and auto counters provided support. At the close, the Sensex was down 58 points or 0.07 percent at 82,102, while the Nifty 50 slipped 33 points or 0.13 percent to 25,170. Market breadth on the NSE remained weak, with 1,751 stocks advancing against 2,216 declining and 146 unchanged, reflecting broader selling pressure despite selective gains in large-cap names. Here is how financial markets across the globe fared overnight: GIFT Nifty (Slips) The GIFT Nifty is trading lower at around 25,203, indicating a weak start for the day. Asian Equities (Down) Asian stocks fell after Wall Street shares retreated as mixed signals from Federal Reserve policymakers clouded the path for interest-rate cuts.  US Equities (Slip) US stocks finished lower on Tuesday, breaking a three-session string of record closing highs, as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the U.S. central bank needs to balance inflation concerns with a weakening job market in its coming interest rate decisions. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 88.76 points, or 0.19%, to 46,292.78, the S&P 500 lost 36.83 points, or 0.55%, to 6,656.92, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 215.50 points, or 0.95%, to 22,573.47.  US Bond Yield (Down) The yield on 10-year Treasuries was down marginally at 4.1 percent, and 2-year Treasuries were down 2 basis points at 3.56 percent.  Dollar Index (Flat) The dollar hovered near its weakest level in close to a week on Wednesday with traders expecting two more U.S. interest rate cuts this year, even after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell struck a cautious tone on further easing.  Asian currencies (Down) Asian currencies were trading lower, with the Indonesian Rupiah leading the losers, followed by the Taiwan Dollar, Japanese Yen, Philippine Peso, Thai Baht, and Singapore Dollar.  Crude (Up) Oil prices rose for a second day on Wednesday as an industry report showed U.S. crude inventories declined last week, adding to a sense in the market of tightening supplies.  Gold (Flat) Gold traded just below a record after a three-day advance, as investors assessed a raft of commentary from Federal Reserve policymakers, including Chair Jerome Powell, and geopolitical tensions over Russia.  Fund Flow Action The Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) extended the selling on the second day on September 23 as sold equities worth Rs 3551 crore, while Domestic institutional investors (DIIs) continued their buying in this month, as they purchased equities worth Rs 2670 crore on the same day.

Asian stocks edge lower after mixed Fed signals,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/asian-stocks-edge-lower-after-mixed-fed-signals-13572158.html,"Asian stocks retreated after a drop in big tech halted the S&P 500’s three-day rally, while mixed signals from Federal Reserve policymakers clouded the path for interest-rate cuts. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.2% at the open with declines in Japan, which returned after a holiday, Australia and South Korea. Equity-index futures pointed to a flat start for Hong Kong, where markets are due to open even as the financial hub braces for Typhoon Ragasa. Treasuries held their gains as Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned that risks persisted in both the labor market and inflation. He also reiterated that policymakers face a difficult path as they weigh further easing. “Powell doesn’t want to antagonize the White House but he’s not rolling over either,” said David Russell at TradeStation. “He’s keeping his options open in case price pressures increase. Powell’s not trying to sound hawkish, but he’s trying to dodge some of the forceful demand for aggressive cuts.” Fed officials lowered their benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point last week and penciled in two more reductions this year following months of intense pressure from the White House to slash borrowing costs. While most shares in the S&P 500 rose on Tuesday, the index slipped. A gauge of tech megacaps lost 1.6%. In late hours, Micron Technology Inc. gave an upbeat forecast. Oil extended gains early Wednesday on mounting risks to Russian supply, including strikes by Ukraine on energy infrastructure and heightened tensions with NATO. An index of US-listed Chinese companies fell 2.2% on Tuesday, its biggest loss in almost a month. In the US, some policymakers are becoming more concerned about growing risks to the labor market, while others remain primarily worried about the possibility that above-target inflation could be pushed higher by tariffs and other policies. Fed Governor Michelle Bowman said officials need to act decisively to bring down rates as the labor market weakens. Fed Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic said he sees more inflation coming, echoing remarks from his Chicago counterpart Austan Goolsbee. “While some hawkish Fed officials put a lot of weight on market developments and see this as a reason to be wary about cutting rates any further in the near term, this is not the way Powell and the core group think,” said Krishna Guha at Evercore. Prospects of further rate cuts, surprisingly strong profit growth and enthusiasm for Big Tech companies that are capitalizing on artificial intelligence have all kept equities near their all-time highs. The record-setting advance has pushed the S&P 500 nearly 3% above the average year-end forecast among those tracked by Bloomberg, which currently stands at 6,486. Only in 2024 and 1999 have the analyst calls lagged the market’s actual return so much around this time of the year. “The bull market in equities is ‘alive and kicking’,” said Craig Johnson at Piper Sandler. “While we maintain our bullish outlook over the intermediate- to longer-term, we also recognize that the SPX has advanced for nearly five straight months without a material pullback.”"
"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Union Bank, Jindal Steel, Samvardhana Motherson, Canara Bank, HPCL, NTPC, and others on September 24?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-union-bank-jindal-steel-samvardhana-motherson-canara-bank-hpcl-ntpc-and-others-on-september-24-13572117.html,"The benchmark indices closed with moderate losses on September 23, extending the downward move for three days on the trot. The market breadth remained supported by bears. About 1,591 shares declined against 1,181 advancing shares on the NSE. The market may see some more consolidation amid rangebound trading in the upcoming sessions. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Amol Athawale, VP Technical Research at Kotak Securities Union Bank of India | CMP: Rs 140.2  On the weekly charts, Union Bank of India is in a rising channel chart formation with a higher high and higher low series pattern. The stock witnessed a steady recovery from trendline support levels. Additionally, the technical indicator RSI is also indicating a further uptrend from current levels, which could boost the bullish momentum in the near future. For positional traders, Rs 135 would be the decisive level. Trading above the same, the uptrend formation will continue till Rs 150. However, if it closes below Rs 135, traders may prefer to exit from trading long positions. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 150 Stop-Loss: Rs 135 Jindal Steel | CMP: Rs 1,062.7  After the remarkable up move of the last few weeks, Jindal Steel witnessed consolidation near the resistance zone. However, after the upward rally, the stock comfortably closed above its breakout zone. The closing above its resistance zone on the daily scale suggests a bullish continuation chart structure and the up move is likely to persist in the coming horizon. For the next few trading sessions, Rs 1,025 could be the trend-decider level for the bulls. If it sustains above the same, we can expect a further uptrend towards Rs 1,140. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,140 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,025 Tata Motors | CMP: Rs 701.35  On the weekly scale, post-reversal from the lower levels, Tata Motors is currently in a phase of consolidation for the last couple of sessions. However, recent bullish activity near the demand zone is indicating good strength. The gradual up moves in the stock suggest a fresh leg of bullish trend in the near term. As long as the stock is trading above Rs 675, the bullish texture is likely to continue. Above which, the stock could move up to Rs 750. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 750 Stop-Loss: Rs 675 Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities Samvardhana Motherson International | CMP: Rs 112  The sharp upside momentum continued on Tuesday in Samvardhana Motherson after a small pause in the trend. The stock price has broken above the bullish flag/pennant-type pattern as per the daily timeframe chart. A bullish pattern like higher highs and lows is intact as per smaller and larger timeframe charts. Volume has started to expand during the upside breakout in the stock price, and the daily 14-period RSI shows a positive indication. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 124 Stop-Loss: Rs 105 Canara Bank | CMP: Rs 121.9  The PSU banking stock Canara Bank has been in a sharp uptrended movement over the last few weeks. We observe a decisive upside breakout of the hurdle of the downsloping trendline at Rs 115 levels on the weekly chart, and the stock price has closed higher. Volume has expanded recently during the upside breakout in the stock price, and the daily 14-period RSI shows a positive indication. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 135 Stop-Loss: Rs 115 NTPC | CMP: Rs 343  NTPC has been in a larger consolidation pattern over the last few months. The stock price has broken above the crucial resistance of the downsloping trendline this week at Rs 340 levels. This action is expected to be a decisive breakout of the larger consolidation pattern in the near term. The volume pattern and weekly RSI show a positive indication. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 375 Stop-Loss: Rs 325 Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors Hindustan Petroleum Corporation | CMP: 424.3  In the previous session, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL) managed to outperform its sector and gained 2.8 percent, which is a sign of strength in the ongoing trend. Since September 8, prices have managed to protect their prior day’s low on a closing basis, which keeps the daily bias on the side of the bulls. Along with this, the 15-period EMA (Exponential Moving Average) and 30-period EMA have recently witnessed a bullish crossover, which further reinforces a positive outlook for the stock. Additionally, MACD is now trading above the zero line with sustained green histograms above the zero line. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 435, Rs 450 Stop-Loss: Rs 407 Bank of India | CMP: Rs 121.43  Bank of India continued to make higher highs with each passing day, and in the previous session, the stock managed to close in green near the prior swing high of Rs 121.6 levels with a surge in volumes. On the daily chart, the stock, since July 2025, has been witnessing a rounding bottom formation, and currently it is trading near the neckline of the pattern, i.e., near Rs 122 levels. For now, a decisive break above it is required for a fresh rally to emerge on the upside. Also, ADX is trading at 31 levels, which suggests good momentum is likely to continue in the stock. The current trend for Bank of India is on the verge of a breakout. For now, a decisive break above the Rs 122 level can trigger a trending move towards Rs 127 followed by Rs 132 levels. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 127, Rs 132 Stop-Loss: Rs 117 Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol are their own and not those of the website or its management.

"Bank Nifty rebounds 500 pts from day's low, led by PSU banks; here are the triggers",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/bank-nifty-rebounds-500-pts-from-day-s-low-led-by-psu-banks-here-are-the-triggers-13570810.html,"Bank Nifty on Tuesday rebounded 500 points from the day’s low to hit an intraday high of 55,662, lifted by gains in select private and public sector lenders. The index snapped a two-day losing streak, closing 0.4 percent higher. Nifty PSU Bank also ended more than 1 percent up, reversing the previous session’s decline. AU Small Finance Bank was the top gainer in the Nifty Bank index, rising nearly 4 percent to Rs 731.65 on the NSE. The stock advanced after brokerage Motilal Oswal projected that the lender’s earnings would accelerate from the second half of FY26, with loan growth expected at a compounded 24 percent over FY26-28. The brokerage retained a “hold” rating with a median price target of Rs 773. IndusInd Bank gained after the lender appointed Viral Damania as chief financial officer, effective September 22. The move follows last month’s announcement of veteran banker Rajiv Anand taking charge as chief executive officer for a three-year term. Shares of State Bank of India ended 1.68 percent higher at Rs 869.60 after brokerage CLSA named the country’s largest lender among its top picks in the large-cap banking space. CLSA said SBI could achieve a market capitalisation of USD 100 billion within a year. Canara Bank closed 2.5 percent higher after its asset management arm, Canara Robeco Asset Management, filed an updated draft red herring prospectus with market regulator Sebi for an initial public offering. Axis Bank also contributed to the rebound after HSBC raised its price target to Rs 1,340 from Rs 1,270, reiterating a “buy” rating. The brokerage said earnings were at an inflection point.

"Vodafone Idea shares rise up to 7% ahead of SC hearing on AGR plea, extend rally to 38% in 3 weeks",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/vodafone-idea-shares-rise-up-to-7-ahead-of-sc-hearing-on-agr-plea-extend-rally-to-38-in-3-weeks-13570713.html,"The shares of Vodafone Idea surged nearly 7 percent on September 23. The stock has now rallied around 38 percent in September so far as investors awaited Supreme Court's decision on possible relief from some AGR dues. Vodafone Idea shares hit an intraday high of Rs 8.97 apiece, the highest level seen by the stock in more than seven months. The stock later pared some gains to trade around 5 percent higher at Rs 8.79 apiece. Supreme Court set to hear telco's AGR relief plea on Friday The Supreme Court is set to hear the telco's challenge to a fresh Rs 9,450-crore adjusted gross revenue (AGR) demand from the Centre on September 26 (Friday). Centre earlier told the apex court, ""Not opposing Vodafone Idea plea, some solution is required, government is also an equity holder. Some solution may be required, subject to Supreme Court approval."" The case stems from the Court's March 18, 2020 order, which upheld AGR dues up to FY17 as calculated by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) and ruled out any reassessment by operators. The DoT had raised an extra demand on AGR dues worth Rs 2,774 crore for FY18-19. The petition said that out of the total Re 9,450 crore of demand, Rs 2,774 crore pertains to post-merger entity — Idea Group and Vodafone Idea — following their August 2018 consolidation, while Rs 5,675 crore relates to the pre-merger Vodafone Group’s liabilities. Vodafone Idea has contested the calculation, claiming that certain amounts have been added twice and need reconciliation. The company has asked for a recalculation of dues, starting from the pre-FY17 period. Citi calls Vodafone Idea a 'high-risk' buy Brokerage firm Citi called Vodafone Idea shares a 'high risk' buy, but set a target price of Rs 10 per share. This implies an upside potential of more than 19 percent from the stock’s previous closing price of Rs 8.39 apiece. According to the brokerage note cited by CNBC-TV18, Citi said the chances for a potential relief for the company have now increased. The shares of the debt-ridden telecom company had earlier seen significant plunge. The shares of the telecom company have surged around 47 percent in just six weeks after hitting a 52-week low of Rs 6.12 per shares, which they had hit in August this year. The stock is however still down around 25 percent from their 52-week high of Rs 11.94 apiece.

Buy Indian Metals and Ferro Alloys; target of Rs 1510: Anand Rathi,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-indian-metals-and-ferro-alloys-target-of-rs-1510-anand-rathi-13569863.html,"Anand Rathi's research report on Indian Metals and Ferro Alloys The largest fully integrated value-added ferrochrome producer in India, IMFA is raising production capacity ~35%, from ~284,000 tonnes to ~384,000 with a greenfield ferrochrome plant at Kalinganagar expected by mid CY26. It has received in-principle approval to expand capacity a further ~200,000 tonnes. To support expanded operations, environmental clearance for its captive chrome ore mines at Sukinda and Mahagiri has been raised to 1.2m tonnes, with ore raising of 0.9m tonnes expected by FY28 and 1.2m by FY31 (PRC). Besides, levering the available land bank and bulk raw material handling infrastructure at Therubali, it is setting up a 120kL/day ethanol plant. This value-accretive diversification is expected to generate ~Rs3bn revenue yearly with an 8-10% EBITDA margin. >80% of demand for ferro-chrome, a key ingredient in stainless steel production, is driven by the industry. Demand in India for ferrochrome is expected to rise further as stainless steel consumption grows, backed by urbanisation, government initiatives to boost manufacturing and infrastructure, and greater demand from automotives, railways, etc. Outlook Considering IMFA’s fully integrated operations, ~0.1x leverage and high-teen return ratios, we initiate coverage with a Buy rating and a sum-of-parts TP of Rs1,510.

The Indian CG sector outlook is steady, with 4-5% volume/8- 9% value CAGR amid key user industries like AlcoBev, Food & Beverage (F&B), and pharma growing healthily while the input cost environment is benign, with soda ash and energy costs well-contained. AGI is expanding glass capacity by 30% to ~2,600tpd by FY27-end with a new Rs7bn plant in Madhya Pradesh, while also diversifying into the aluminium can segment (1.6bn capacity by CY30; Rs10bn capex), which is a fast-growing (15% CAGR), 2-player market in India currently. AGI also has smaller caps & closures and PET bottle businesses, which should grow in double digits on a low base. We estimate 17% revenue/29% APAT CAGR during FY25-28E with RoE/RoCE improving to 19% by FY28E. FY26-27 would be the capex phase, followed by healthy FCF generation, with 2% yield in FY28E and growth thereafter.

The company is rolling out new products and improving CPV via premiumization. The company’s 4W business (9% of topline in FY25) also should see a strong escalation on the back of strong order-book, improved technological capabilities through H-One acquisition, entry into Japanese OEMs and fresh ties with a leading Japanese PV OEM to reach 12-13% of topline by FY28. We believe increase in 4W share shall further improve the CPV and lead to re-rating of the stock. We anticipate Belrise to deliver ~34% PAT CAGR over FY25-28E as operating performance (13% EBITDA CAGR) is multiplied by de-leveraging impact. Outlook The planned and proposed transfer of related party entities should simplify group structure and thus be value accretive, adding to re-rating levers. Any occurrence of hiving off or reduction in the low margin Trading business would further drive profitability of the stock. We initiate with a BUY.

The recovery in credit cost, margins, and loan growth (led by festival demand and GST cuts) will aid earnings, while the transition to a universal bank provides a strong runway for growth. Deposit mobilization continues to remain healthy, with stable deposits forming ~79% of the total deposits. During 1QFY26, NIM contracted sharply to 5.4% but is expected to bottom out in 2Q and recover thereafter. AUBANK’s GNPA rose 19bp QoQ to 2.47% in 1QFY26; however, it expects stress to peak in 2Q. The bank has incurred 34bp of credit costs in 1Q, and we estimate 2Q credit costs to be ~30bp. This implies a sharp deceleration in provisioning expenses during 2H as management maintains its full-year guidance of 100bp. Outlook We estimate AUBANK to deliver 24% loan CAGR over FY26-28, which, coupled with improvement in operating metrics, will enable a 33% earnings CAGR. The recent correction in stock price has made the risk-reward favorable. Hence, we reiterate our BUY rating on the stock with an unchanged TP of INR875 (based on 2.8x FY27E BV).

This stabilized prices after a peak in Jun’25. The Indian tea business remained resilient, with pricing actions partly offsetting cost pressures; margins contracted in 1QFY26 but are expected to improve from 2Q as production improves and prices stabilize. Alongside, the company is expanding its health & wellness portfolio, premiumizing its tea product portfolio in the domestic market, and maintaining ecommerce leadership. In this note, we have analyzed tea prices and production trends and their impact on Tata Consumer Products (TATACONS). Outlook We expect TATACONS to clock a revenue/EBITDA/PAT CAGR of 10%/12%/13% during FY25-27. We reiterate our BUY rating with an SoTP-based TP of INR1,300.

"Auto shares in the fast lane on festive demand, Maruti hits 52-week high on Goldman Sachs' Buy call",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/auto-shares-in-the-fast-lane-on-festive-demand-maruti-hits-52-week-high-on-goldman-sachs-buy-call-13569052.html,"Signs of robust demand for two and four-wheelers have spurred shares of automotive companies, with the Nifty Auto index rising by nearly 1.5 percent on September 23, led by Maruti, Eicher, Tata Motors, M&M and Hero Moto along with consumer loan NBFC Bajaj Finance, thus cushioning the broader market weakness. Among F&O names, Ashok Leyland, Bajaj Auto, TVS Motor and Bharat Forge joined the ranks of top gainers. The momentum has ensured that all components of the Auto index were trading higher, barring one.  Over the last 30 days, shares of ancillary players such as Motherson Sumi and Bharat Forge are higher between 10-15 percent, in ancitipation of the ruboff to their businesses. Early trends and dealer channel checks have showed that the first day of the festive sales during the ongoing Navratri season have seen a healthy demand, with Maruti, Tata Motors and Hyundai Motor India posting strong bookings following a subdued September due the Shradhh period during which fresh purchases are typically deferred. Brokerages Bullish Adding the momentum for Maruti was a bullish note by Goldman Sachs that has upgraded the stock Buy from Neutral with a target of Rs 18,900 per share, sending the shares to a 52-week high. In a separate note, Nuvama said the demand upcycle in the passenger car segment could continue up to FY29, helped by GST 2.0 with healthy demand expected across two-wheelers, tractors, and PVs. ""PV is at a mid to advanced stage of the upcycle. Average/maximum duration of upcycle as per historical data is six/eight years; hence, upcycle can continue up to FY27/FY29,"" said the Nuvama note. The brokerage attributed the momentum in automotive companies to GST cuts, new launches, the anticipation of benefit from the upcoming pay commission recommendation for government employees and hopes of another RBI rate cuts this year. Nuvama cited historical data that suggested upcycles lasting between 6-8 years to suggest that the current cycle in 2Ws could continue till FY30. Emkay Global quoted an automotive dealer from Western India who said that the tide may be turning for passenger cars after nearly two years of subdued growth. It quoted a 15-20% on year growth in bookings across segments so far in September for the region. The volume growth for October-December period is expected to over 20 percent, the dealer added. The automotive dealer told Emkay that the demand for electric 2Ws is expected to sustain even after the price gap with ICE bikes has narrowed following the GST cut, and said customers are willing to pay a premium for differentiated offerings. Trucks are seeing more value growth than volume growth as fleet operators are choosing to shift to higher tonnage vehicles to improve utilization, the dealer told Emkay Global. Read More: Maruti Suzuki's sharp price cuts may hit margin by 100 bps near term: Nomura Carmakers See Strong Demand Tata Motors has recorded 10,000 deliveries and over 25,000 enquiries on the first day of Navratri, in a sign of strong demand on the first day of the festive season. The management of Maruti said the company has had close to 30,000 bookings and 80,000 enquiries were registered on the first day of Navratri. Hyundai Motor India said the company recorded 11,000 dealer billings on September 22, marking its best day in five years. The management said it sees the demand sustaining ahead. Maruti has further extended the passthrough of GST benefits by cutting prices of entry-level hatchbacks in a strategic manner in an attempt to revive the small car segment. Maruti's current discount schemes are expected to continue till the end of September, over and above the price cuts. Tarun Garg, Whole-Time Director and COO of Hyundai Motor India said, ""The auspicious start of Navratri, amplified by the momentum from GST 2.0 reforms, has infused strong positivity into the market. On Day 1 alone, Hyundai Motor India Limited recorded around 11,000 Dealer billings, which is our highest single-day performance in the last five years"". The robust sentiment and customer confidence has prompted Hyundai to anticipate that the demand is expected to sustain. Tata Motors had in August said that it is 'hopeful' of the festive demand extending till December 2025, as was the trend during the last financial year. All segments of cars ranging from hatchbacks to luxury SUVs have become cheaper, with customers standing to save between Rs 40,000 and Rs 30 lakh on ex-showroom prices.

Asian stocks primed for best year against US peers since 2017,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/asian-stocks-primed-for-best-year-against-us-peers-since-2017-13568487.html,"Asian stocks will likely keep eclipsing their US peers, as a weaker dollar further raises the appeal of a region that has benefited from cheaper valuations and a momentous shift away from American assets, according to analysts. Also supporting the region’s equities are growing signs of easing trade tensions, especially between the US and China, where a months-long rally looks far from over. While the Federal Reserve’s latest interest rate cut was a given, it reinforced a bearish outlook for the US currency and opened up space for Asian central banks to loosen policy. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index has climbed 22% this year, beating the S&P 500 Index by around eight percentage points and set for the biggest annual outperformance since 2017.  “We are tactically constructive on APAC equities’ relative performance in the remainder of the year versus US equities,” said Homin Lee, a senior macro strategist at Lombard Odier Singapore Ltd. A confluence of factors, from stable commodity prices to lower US rates and fading trade disruption should provide a decent backdrop for the markets, he added. The MSCI Asia gauge is trading at 16 times forward earnings estimates, below the S&P 500’s 23 times. Meanwhile, the Hang Seng Tech Index that jumped to a four-year high last week trades at around 21 times forward earnings, versus 27 times for the Nasdaq 100 Index, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. While the speed and magnitude of the Fed’s policy easing cycle remains uncertain, its rate cut last week was an extra boost to Asian currencies. Signals from the options market suggest traders are paying a premium to hedge against further strength in Asian currencies. Aggregates of risk reversals in the region, a measure of demand for options that pay out if the currencies strengthen against the dollar over various periods, have been in positive territory for months.  “Given this backdrop we are increasing our exposure to non-US equities including Asian equities relative to US equities,” said Chang Hwan Sung, a multi-asset portfolio manager in Invesco’s investment solutions team in Hong Kong. The preference is mainly driven by a bearish view on the greenback and “US capital outflows seeking international diversification and foreign currency appreciation,” he added. To be sure, any inflation-driven pause on the Fed’s rate-cut cycle or even a hawkish policy pivot would easily reverse investor sentiment, while the US-China ties remain vulnerable to deterioration. Meantime, political uncertainties in Indonesia, Thailand and Japan are also in focus. But for now, there’s optimism that as US exceptionalism continues to draw skeptics, the appetite for Asian stocks will likely stay strong. “The U.S. remains the center of gravity for AI and corporate earnings power, but Asia offers distinct angles,” said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo Markets, citing “India’s domestic demand story, Japan’s banks amid Bank of Japan tightening, and selective China tech plays where policy support and monetization are starting to align.”"

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Bajaj Finance, Tata Motors, United Spirits, BHEL, Cholamandalam Investment, Godawari Power, and others on September 23?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-bajaj-finance-tata-motors-united-spirits-bhel-cholamandalam-investment-godawari-power-and-others-on-september-23-13567886.html,"Equity benchmarks remained under pressure for the second consecutive session, correcting half a percent on September 22 with negative market breadth. A total of 1,790 shares were backed by bears, against 1,037 shares that were supported by bulls on the NSE. Rangebound trading may continue, and Monday's low could be crucial for further direction. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi UCO Bank | CMP: Rs 30.7  UCO Bank has recently confirmed the completion of Wave 2 on the weekly Elliott Wave structure, as highlighted in the chart, setting the stage for a potential Wave 3 rally. Supporting this outlook, bullish divergence is observed on both the MACD line and histogram, indicating improving momentum. Alongside this, a noticeable surge in volumes and a trendline breakout further validate the strength of the ongoing move. These technical signals collectively point to a favourable risk-reward setup. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 31–30 zone, with an upside target of 36. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 36 Stop-Loss: Rs 28 Hindustan Zinc | CMP: Rs 459.25  Hindustan Zinc has recently broken out of its consolidation range and is now trading comfortably above it, signalling renewed strength in price action. On the weekly chart, the stock has registered a bullish crossover on the MACD indicator, which typically indicates a shift in momentum in favour of the bulls. This technical setup suggests the possibility of a further upside move in the coming sessions. Sustaining above the breakout zone will be key for the continuation of the rally, while any dips toward immediate support levels may attract fresh buying interest. Overall, the trend looks constructive with a positive bias. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 460–450 zone, with an upside target of Rs 505. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 505 Stop-Loss: Rs 430 Sequent Scientific | CMP: Rs 203.59  Sequent has shown encouraging signs on the weekly chart, where a trendline breakout accompanied by a noticeable surge in volumes has been observed. This combination typically signals strong buying interest and validates the breakout’s reliability. Adding to the bullish outlook, the MACD has registered a bullish crossover just above the zero line on the weekly scale, which strengthens the momentum setup and indicates a shift in favour of the bulls. This alignment of price action with supporting indicators suggests that the stock may continue its upward trajectory in the near term. Overall, the technical structure remains constructive, favouring a sustained bullish move. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 204–200 zone, with a target of Rs 240. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 240 Stop-Loss: Rs 180 Jay Thakkar, Vice President & Head of Derivatives and Quant Research at ICICI Securities Bajaj Finance | CMP: Rs 1,006.5  Bajaj Finance has provided a breakout from a consolidation due to short covering, and it has been one of the best performers in the NBFC space in recent times. The stock is trading well above its 20-day VWAP (volume-weighted average price) of Rs 950, and it has just inched above its maximum pain level of Rs 1,000, so this is an immediate support range. The PCR (Put-Call Ratio) has jumped to 0.92 levels now, and the Rs 1,120 strike has the highest Call base, beyond which there will be a further round of up move. So, we advise buying Bajaj Finance Futures in the range of Rs 1,000–1,110. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,150, Rs 1,180 Stop-Loss: Rs 965 Tata Motors | CMP: Rs 696.25  Tata Motors has broken its critical support level of Rs 700 and closed below it as well, which is a negative sign in the near term. Overall, the stock has been an underperformer in its sector, and now it has closed below the 20-day VWAP level as well. Hence, the overall bias has turned negative for the stock. There have been significant Call additions at the higher levels from the Rs 700 to Rs 730 strikes, with the highest Call open interest at the Rs 720 strike. So, the risk-to-reward is quite favourable on the short side. We advise selling Tata Motors Futures in the range of Rs 694–698. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 675, Rs 665 Stop-Loss: Rs 710 United Spirits | CMP: Rs 1,339.9  United Spirits has witnessed a unidirectional fall from Rs 1,650 to Rs 1,280 with an increase in open interest, indicating short build-up, and now there has been a reduction in the open interest, indicating short covering. The stock price has, however, not bounced much, so there is more room left on the upside. The stock has witnessed Call unwinding at the Rs 1,320 and Rs 1,340 strikes; however, Rs 1,340 to Rs 1,400 strikes still have significant Call base, which may act as resistance. The stock has witnessed Put additions from the Rs 1,300 to Rs 1,340 strikes, so this range will act as support. This increases the probability of a retracement or a bounce-back in the last week of the September series due to short covering. So, we advise buying United Spirits Futures in the range of Rs 1,340–1,350. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,400, Rs 1,430 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,295 Vidnyan S Sawant, Head of Research at GEPL Capital BHEL | CMP: Rs 239.60  Bharat Heavy Electricals on the weekly scale has exhibited a bullish hidden divergence, aligning with the 61.80% Fibonacci retracement level and the 100-week EMA. From this confluence zone, the stock has formed three consecutive bullish candlesticks. On the daily scale, it is trading firmly above the key 12-, 26-, and 50-DEMA levels, underscoring strong trend strength. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 264 Stop-Loss: Rs 230 Belrise Industries | CMP: Rs 154  Since listing, the stock has maintained strong momentum with a higher-high, higher-low structure on the monthly scale. In the prior week, it hit a fresh lifetime high, breaking out of a four-week consolidation with strong volume support. On the daily scale, a base around the 26-day EMA highlights healthy price action, while the MACD in buy mode confirms sustained bullish momentum. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 171 Stop-Loss: Rs 147 Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Company | CMP: Rs 1,630  Cholamandalam Investment has been forming higher bottoms and recently established a base at the 50-week EMA, where the MACD has given a bullish crossover, indicating improving momentum. On the daily scale, the stock has broken its lower-top formation, suggesting continuation of the upward trajectory. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,825 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,548 Godawari Power and Ispat | CMP: Rs 263.6  On the weekly scale, GPIL has registered a decisive breakout above the December 2024 swing top, supported by strong volume activity, with volumes surpassing the 20-day average — a sign of robust participation behind the move. On the daily scale, the stock continues to trade firmly above its key 12-, 20-, and 50-DEMA levels, highlighting a well-established bullish trend and reinforcing the potential for sustained upward momentum. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 295 Stop-Loss: Rs 250 Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol are their own and not those of the website or its management.

"Sebi proposes relief for stock brokers on technical glitch norms, issues draft circular",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sebi-proposes-relief-for-stock-brokers-on-technical-glitch-norms-issues-draft-circular-13567208.html,"The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has proposed a major relief for the brokers on technical glitch framework. As per the proposal disruptions caused by global cloud service providers, glitches at market infrastructure institutions (MIIs), delays in KYC processing, back-office issues not affecting trading, payment gateway failures at banks or aggregators, and problems in decision-support tools such as charts or reports will not be counted as technical glitch. Sebi has issued a draft circular on the same and has sought public feedback on the same by October 2, 2025. The revised definition of technical glitch is expected to bring more clarity and ease the compliance. Through Sebi has not changed the 5-minute time interval for consideration as a technical glitch. Sebi draft circular said, “Technical glitch shall mean any malfunction in the electronic system of stock broker, including malfunction in its hardware, software, networks/bandwidth, processes or products or services, directly or indirectly related to trading and risk management, occurred during trading session of stock exchange. The malfunction in the systems of stock brokers or the one outsourced from any third parties, which may lead to either stoppage, slowing down or variance in the trading and risk management functions such as log-in, order placement (including modification, cancelation, execution, confirmation, status), allocation and viewing of margin/ collateral/ funds etc., for a contiguous period of five minutes or more.” Moneycontrol had reported on June 26 that brokers have requested exchanges and Sebi to further ease the technical glitch reporting norms, seeing the practical difficulties. Sebi had issued a framework in December 2022 and after the inputs from industry exchanges had issued revised circular in March this year. Sebi paper said,” Sebi received several representations from the various stakeholders and Industry forum regarding need to review the present framework on technical glitches. The feedback received from the stakeholders, stock exchanges and data on the technical glitches were discussed in Stock brokers ISF and their recommendations were analysed”. Sebi paper further said, “Based on the feedback and the analysis of data, it has been decided to review extant framework of technical glitches at stock broke systems”. The framework will apply only to brokers offering internet-based or securities trading through wireless technology (IBT/STWT) platforms with more than 10,000 clients. This effectively exempts around 457 smaller brokers, easing their compliance burden given their limited technology exposure.  Rationalization of reporting of technical glitch to Stock Exchange is proposed to be eased considering reasonable time require to report and considering trading holidays etc. Further, reporting is proposed to be done at the Common Reporting platform to avoid the multiple reporting by stock brokers. Reporting norms have also been streamlined. Brokers must notify exchanges and clients about glitches within two hours and file a preliminary incident report by the next trading day. A root cause analysis must follow within 14 days. All reports will be routed through a common platform, Samuhik Prativedan Manch, to avoid duplication. Sebi has also proposed that financial disincentive will also be rationalised. The regulator has also proposed rationalisation of financial disincentives. Minor glitches or those affecting only one mode of trading (mobile or web) while the other remains functional will not attract penalties. Exchanges, in consultation with Sebi, will issue detailed guidelines. Also read: Market participants seek protocol after September’s last-minute holiday change shook the settlement system Sebi has emphasised that brokers must undertake robust capacity planning and rigorous testing of software changes to prevent disruptions.

The proposed changes aim to balance investor protection with operational ease for brokers, as rising investor participation continues to test the resilience of trading platforms.

Click to View More Outlook for September 23 Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The Nifty has been witnessing a pullback over the last two days, which is absolutely normal considering the 1,000-point rally that preceded it. In fact, such minor corrections are healthy for a sustained uptrend. In the short term, support is placed at 25,050, and the overall structure remains intact as long as the index holds above this level. A decisive break below 25,050 could extend the correction towards 24,800. On the upside, resistance is seen at 25,250. A move above this level could signal a resumption of the uptrend. Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities Nifty continued to slide down for the second consecutive sessions on Monday and closed the day lower by 124 points amidst volatility. After opening with a downside gap of 89 points, the market showed quick recovery from the lows and filled the opening down gap in the early part of the session. Nifty was unable to sustain the recovery and declined again in the mid to later part of the session and closed near the lows. A reasonable negative candle was formed on the daily chart with gap down opening and with long upper shadow. Technically, this market action indicates continuation of short-term downward correction in the market with sell on rise. Medium to long-term trend of Nifty remains positive and the current weakness could be a buy-on-dips opportunity for the short term. Nifty is expected to find support around 25000 levels and is likely to bounce back from the lows. Immediate resistance is placed at 25450.

The note added that LIC and SBI Life, along with HDFC Life and GIC Re remain among the top of its pecking order in the space. With in the non-life insurance space, the note finds more upside potential in the reinsurance sector while India's life insurance plays are poised for a most growth upside among Asia, riding on the demographic dividend. Insurers are also adjusting to the GST exemption on health and life insurance premiums which has kicked in from today, potentially reducing cost for the players. With industry promising to pass on the cost, this should result in significant savings for the policy buyers. Life Insurance Soon after the announcement, HDFC Life said on September 4 said that the GST relief will trigger demand. ""...we believe that this change will spur demand over time and hence be accretive to our Value of New Business (VNB). We expect a non-material (less than 0.5%) impact on our Embedded Value (EV). As we have done in the past, we will continue to work towards our aspiration of doubling our Value of New Business over 4-4-1/2 years,"" HDFC Life said. The move is being seen by the industry as structurally positive, and is expected to drive ""higher penetration, improve persistency, and accelerate long-term growth"", according to HDFC Life.

Adani Power shares jump 20% after stock split: Why you should ignore the 80% plunge?,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/adani-power-shares-jump-18-after-stock-split-why-you-should-ignore-the-80-plunge-13565420.html,"The shares of Adani Power appeared to have crashed around 80 percent in one single session on September 22, as the stock price adjusted to a 1:5 stock split. The stock in reality jumped around 20 percent after turning ex-bonus to hit a fresh record high. Adani Power's board of directors during a meeting in August had approved its first-ever stock split in the ratio of 1:5. The record date to determine the eligibility of the shareholders set to receive the bonus equity shares was set on September 22. What it means for shareholders? If a shareholder owns 10 shares of Adani Power worth Rs 100 each, he will own 50 shares of the company after the stock split, with each share being worth Rs 20. However, the total worth of his holding will remain unchanged at Rs 1,000. What is a stock split? A company announces stock split to increase the overall liquidity of the stock. While this increases the total number of shares, it does not change the market capitalization of the company. This makes it more affordable for other investors to add to their portfolio, creating strong upside potential for the stock. Adani Power had earlier said that it has approved the stock split in order to “enhance the liquidity of Company's equity shares by encouraging participation of retail investors as the split will make the shares more affordable to invest”. Adani Power share price: Key details As a result of the stock split, Adani Power shares appeared to have crashed around 80 percent, while in reality, they simply adjusted to the corporate action. The stock jumped around 20 percent to remain locked in the upper circuit at Rs 170.25 apiece, creating a new 52-week high record. Morgan Stanley initiated call on Adani Power with an 'overweight' rating, saying that the company is a ""good illustration of turnaround in India's corporate history"". This comes after market regulator SEBI cleared Gautam Adani and his diversified conglomerate of the stock manipulation charges levelled by US-based short-seller Hindenburg Research. Morgan Stanley called Adani Power its 'top pick'. ""APL will deliver strong earnings growth driven by timely completion of projects & more PPA wins medium term,"" the international brokerage added.

"Avanti Feeds, Apex Frozen shares fall up to 3% after US Senators propose India Shrimp Tariff Act",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/avanti-feeds-apex-frozen-shares-fall-up-to-3-after-us-senators-propose-india-shrimp-tariff-act-13565164.html,"The shares of Indian shrimp exporters dropped in trade on September 22 as investors remained concerned over the 'India Shrimp Tariff Act' which was recently introduced in the American Congress. Avanti Feeds shares dropped around 2.5 percent to trade at Rs 715 apiece, while Apex Frozen shares fell nearly 3.5 percent to trade at Rs 238 apiece. Coastal Corporation shares were down over 1 percent. What is the 'India Shrimp Tariff Act'? US Senators Bill Cassidy and Cindy Hyde-Smith introduced the India Shrimp Tariff Act in Congress last week, aiming to restrict what they described as unfair trade practices by India that threaten Louisiana's shrimp and catfish industries. The proposed act seeks to counter the dumping of Indian shrimp into US markets. ""By leveling the playing field, this bill protects Louisiana seafood and the jobs that depend on it,” Cassidy said, adding that local shrimpers and catfish farmers maintain far higher standards. Hyde-Smith meanwhile said that unchecked imports have hurt US shrimpers, processors, and consumers. ""This bill will put our domestic industry on a more level playing field,"" she said. If passed, the act may hurt the margins of the export-oriented shrimp feed companies. 'Trump tariffs cause a loss of Rs 25,000 crore to India’s shrimp exporters' Earlier last week, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu said that US President Donald Trump's tariffs may have caused a loss of Rs 25,000 crore to India's shrimp exporters, with up to half of the export orders facing cancellations. He requested Centre's support for Andhra's aquaculture sector. ""The taxes imposed by America majorly hit shrimp exports. It is estimated that a loss of Rs 25,000 crore would have occurred. Up to 50 percent export orders have been cancelled,"" Naidu said in a letter to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal and Fisheries Minister Rajiv Ranjan Singh. Andhra Pradesh makes up 80 percent of India's shrimp exports, worth over Rs 21,000 crore every year. During FY24, India exported record volume of seafood worth $7.38 billion, with USA and China being the major importers and frozen shrimp the largest export item, according to data from Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA). During FY25, India shipped seafood worth Rs 62,408 crore ($7.45 billion).

"H-1B visa setback wiped out $10 billion of value in tech shares, Nifty IT down 3 percent",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/h-1b-visa-setback-weighs-on-it-pack-and-broader-index-sinking-nifty-it-lower-by-3-percent-13565168.html,"The H-1B setback weighed on listed shares of Indian large and midcap IT companies, falling between 2-5 percent to take the Nifty IT index down by 3 percent on September 22, as investors turned cautious on likely impact on business and profitability, awaiting further clarity. The market fall wiped out roughly $10 billion in market capitalisation of IT shares. Nine of Nifty IT's 10 constituents ended in the red, and the selling pressure reflected in the benchmark indices Nifty and Sensex too, which ended lower by around 0.50 percent. So far this year, the Nifty IT index is down 18 percent. Among the top losers on Nifty 50 index were the IT names, led by TechM, Wipro, Infosys, HCLTech and TCS, with Tech Mahindra worst hit, down around 3 percent. IT Stocks Sell Off The selling pressure has been broad-based, weighing down even companies such as Firstsource Solutions that have clarified that there no impact of the visa curbs on their business. The company said it has strong local hiring strategy and a globally distributed model which insulates it from changes in immigration regulations, yet the shares of Firstsource are down over 1.5 percent. Persistent Systems too has said it does not see any material impact from the order, yet the shares are sharply lower in the trading session. ""Based on our current assessment, we hereby wish to inform that we do not expect any significant impact of the above Executive Order on our operations or financials. We will continue to monitor the developments in this regard closely...,"" Persistent Systems said in a statement on September 22. Brokerage View JPMorgan in a note to its clients has said that the visa rules could increase prevailing H-1B wages, which could squeeze margins. “In the worst case, if companies simply choose to pay the additional $100,000 fee, the impact could be 2–6% on FY27 EPS with no change in the labour supply chain,” JPMorgan said. Infosys and HCLTech have said that over 60% and 80%- of their US business is independent on visa approvals, a note by Citi said, and the business impact could be seen from FY27 onwards. Jefferies has said that a shortage of talent could push up onsite wages and hurt the profitability of Indian IT companies, or even slow down growth amid macro pressures and AI-related risks. Visa Woes US President Trump had on Saturday overhauled the of visa program by mandating a $100,000 fee for new applications, a move that will impact leading outsourcing companies which rely on American market for a large share of their revenue. Read More: Will the Indian IT sector crumble under the new H1B visa guidelines? Factors at Play The sector is already reeling under sluggish earnings during the June quarter as well as a major layoff announced by TCS, amid Trump's tariffs and US businesses cutting back on IT spend on slowdown worries, even as the US stock market has been hitting record highs. The move is expected to restructure the businesses of IT companies to a costlier onshore model or cheaper program with much of the work being done outside the US, said some IT analysts. Trade Talks The latest move by the US President comes just days after his call with PM Modi during which both nations agreed on the ongoing strategic and comprehensive nature of the partnership. With this latest development on H-1B visas, services exports too have been pulled into trade-related tensions between both counties. Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal is expected to be in the US this week with a delegation to continue trade talks in an effort to achieve an early agreement.

Track the latest updates on GIFT Nifty right here on Moneycontrol. Indian equity markets snapped a three-day winning run to end lower, with Nifty 50 closing below 25,350 as selling gripped FMCG, IT and banking shares, however, buying in realty, oil & gas, power and PSU banks limited the losses. At close, the Sensex was down 387.73 points or 0.47 percent at 82,626.23, and the Nifty was down 96.55 points or 0.38 percent at 25,327.05. BSE Midcap and smallcap indices ended flat. For the week, BSE Sensex and Nifty gained nearly a percent each. Here is how financial markets across the globe fared overnight: GIFT Nifty (Falls) The GIFT Nifty is trading lower at around 25,329, indicating a weak start for the day. Asian Equities (Gain) Asian shares advanced, led by Japan, after the central bank eased concerns over plans to offload itsmassive exchange-traded fund holdings.  US Equities (Rise) Global stocks rose in choppy trading on Friday, on track for a weekly gain, driven by positive sentiment on Wall Street following key central bank decisions. The Federal Reserve cut U.S. interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday, the first easing since December, while Norway and Canada also cut rates. On Wall Street, all three indexes closed at record highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.37% to 46,315.27, the S&P 500 advanced 0.49% to 6,664.36, and the Nasdaq Composite firmed 0.72% to 22,631.48. All three also hit record highs the day before.  US Bond Yield (Up) The yield on 10-year Treasuries and 2-year Treasuries were up marginally at 4.13%, 3.57%, respectively.  Dollar Index (Up) The dollar was steady on Monday as traders looked ahead to a slew of speeches from Federal Reserve officials throughout the week that could provide further clues on the U.S. rate outlook, after the central bank resumed its easing cycle last week.  Asian currencies (Down) Asian currencies were trading mostly lower in the early trade on Monday, with the Indonesian Rupiah leading the losers followed by the Japanese Yen, Taiwan Dollar, China Renminbi, Malaysian Ringgit, Singapore Dollar, Philippines Peso.  Crude (Up) Oil prices inched up on Monday supported by geopolitical tension in Europe and the Middle East, although the prospect of more oil supply and concern about the impact of trade tariffs on global fuel demand weighed.  Gold (Up) Gold held a fifth weekly advance, boosted by the Federal Reserve’s first rate cut of the year, with investors looking to a key inflation print due Friday for more clues about the US central bank’s monetary path.  Fund Flow Action The Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) remained net buyers on the second consecutive day as they bought equities worth Rs 390 crore on September 19, while Domestic institutional investors (DIIs) bought equities worth Rs 2105 crore on the same day.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Canara Bank, Swiggy, Sequent Scientific, Phoenix Mills, GE Shipping, AGI Infra, and others on September 22?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-canara-bank-swiggy-sequent-scientific-phoenix-mills-ge-shipping-agi-infra-and-others-on-september-22-13564160.html,"The benchmark indices snapped a three-day gain streak, with the Nifty 50 falling 0.4 percent on September 19. The market breadth remained slightly in favour of bears. About 1,421 shares declined compared to 1,352 advancing shares on the NSE. Consolidation may be seen for a few more sessions before entering a new leg of the upmove. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Rajesh Palviya, Senior Vice President Research (Head Technical Derivatives) at Axis Securities Swiggy | CMP: Rs 458.5  On the daily timeframe, Swiggy has confirmed a ""Rounded Bottom"" formation breakout at Rs 459 levels on a closing basis. This breakout is accompanied by huge volumes, which signify increased participation in the rally. The stock is well placed above its 20, 50, 100, and 200-day SMAs, which reconfirms a bullish trend, and these averages are also inching up along with the price rise, further confirming the bullish trend. The daily Bollinger Bands buy signal indicates increased momentum. The daily and weekly strength indicator RSI indicates rising strength. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 503, Rs 540 Stop-Loss: Rs 455 Sequent Scientific | CMP: Rs 200.6  On the weekly timeframe, Sequent Scientific has confirmed an ""Inverse Head & Shoulder"" pattern at Rs 191 levels on a closing basis, along with huge volumes. The daily Bollinger Bands buy signal indicates increased momentum. Currently, the stock is well placed above its 20, 50, 100, and 200-day SMAs, which reconfirms a bullish trend. The daily, weekly, and monthly strength indicator RSI indicates rising strength. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 219, Rs 235 Stop-Loss: Rs 191 Canara Bank | CMP: Rs 117.76  On the weekly chart, Canara Bank has confirmed a ""down-sloping"" channel breakout at Rs 114 levels on a closing basis. This breakout is accompanied by huge volumes, indicating increased participation. The daily Bollinger Bands buy signal indicates increased momentum. The daily, weekly, and monthly strength indicator RSI indicates rising strength. The stock is well placed above its 20, 50, 100, and 200-day SMAs, which reconfirms a bullish trend. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 127, Rs 133 Stop-Loss: Rs 114 Rajesh Bhosale, Technical Analyst at Angel One Sammaan Capital | CMP: Rs 143.21  Sammaan Capital has shown impressive strength since the beginning of September and, in the latest week, has confirmed a bullish reversal breakout from an Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern. This breakout is well-supported by robust volumes and a strong bullish candlestick formation, adding conviction to the move. Further, a bullish crossover between the 89-DMA and 200-DMA has been observed, reinforcing the positive momentum and suggesting the potential for sustained upside in the near term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 160 Stop-Loss: Rs 135 Phoenix Mills | CMP: Rs 1,629.8  After marking an all-time high near Rs 2,050 levels in July last year, Phoenix Mills consolidated within a broad descending triangle pattern. Over the past year, the stock repeatedly faced resistance along the descending trendline, but has now successfully broken out on the upside, indicating a strong reversal. Adding to this, the daily chart also highlights a Cup and Handle bullish breakout, with prices moving decisively above the 200-day SMA. With this confluence of bullish patterns and key technical confirmations, we anticipate a robust upside in the stock, turning the overall outlook strongly positive. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,710 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,588 Great Eastern Shipping Company | CMP: Rs 1,054.4  On the weekly chart, Great Eastern Shipping Company has confirmed a Cup and Handle bullish reversal breakout, supported by strong volumes and a robust bullish candlestick formation. On the momentum front, the weekly RSI (Relative Strength Index) smoothed indicator has moved past the 60 level, signaling a pickup in positive momentum and strengthening prospects of further upside in the near term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,175 Stop-Loss: Rs 990 Anshul Jain, Head of Research at Lakshmishree Investments AGI Infra | CMP: Rs 1,176.4  AGI Infra rallied 14% in just 5 sessions, forming a strong pole followed by 23 days of consolidation, shaping a bullish flag on the daily charts. This structure has now completed a textbook pole-and-flag formation. A breakout above the Rs 1,195–1,205 zone will confirm strength and likely propel the stock toward Rs 1,450 levels. Volumes during the pole were high, while consolidation saw dried-up volumes, which is an ideal flag characteristic. A strong volume breakout above resistance will be key for momentum. With indicators cooled off during consolidation, AGI Infra is well-positioned for an impulsive upmove once the breakout materializes. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,450 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,120 Venus Pipes and Tubes | CMP: Rs 1,396.2  Venus Pipes is forming a 33-day Cup and Handle pattern, indicating potential momentum buildup in the sector, as other pipe companies are also showing strength. The stock is resting on its short-term moving averages (10 and 20), both of which have turned bullish and can act as a propeller for further upside. A breakout above Rs 1,405 with strong volumes will confirm the pattern and open the way for an immediate rally toward Rs 1,600 levels. Structure, moving averages, and sectoral momentum remain aligned for a bullish move, making Venus Pipes an interesting candidate on breakout. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,600 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,300 DCX Systems | CMP: Rs 279.3  DCX India, after posting strong earnings and a bullish gap-up, has been consolidating for 42 days while forming a Cup and Handle pattern. The volume behaviour is ideal, with higher volumes on up moves and dried-up volumes during consolidation, indicating accumulation. The stock is currently testing the neckline of the pattern, and a sustained move above Rs 284 will invite momentum buying. A close above Rs 290 will confirm a decisive breakout and set the stage for a strong rally ahead. With consolidation almost complete, price action and structure favour an imminent bullish breakout.

Broader indices rally continues in third week; these small-caps rise up to 36%,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/broader-indices-rally-continues-in-third-week-these-small-caps-rise-up-to-36-13562589.html,"The outperformance from broader indices continued in third consecutive week, adding 1-2 percent amid buying across the sectors with DII support and favourable global markets. For the week, Nifty50 rose 213.05 points or 0.83 percent to close at 25,327.05, while the BSE Sensex index gained 721.53 points or 0.88 percent to close at 82,626.23. BSE mid, Large-cap indices added 1 percent each, while Small-cap index jumped 2 percent. Foreign Institutional Investors' (FIIs) outflow extended in the 12th straight week, as they sold equities worth Rs 1,327.38 crore, while Domestic Institutional Investors (DII) continued their buying in 23nd week, as they bought equities worth Rs 11,177.37 crore. Among sectors, except Nifty FMCG (down 0.5 percent), all other indices ended higher with Nifty PSU Bank index added nearly 5 percent, Nifty Realty index rose over 4 percent, Nifty Defence index added 3.4 percent, Nifty Energy, Oil & Gas rose 2 percent each. ""Indian equities closed the week on a firm note, supported by broad-based gains, with mid- and small-cap stocks leading the momentum. Robust domestic institutional inflows offset FII selling, cushioning downside risks and sustaining the recent rally,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments. ""With GST rationalisation set to take effect next week and festive demand expected to strengthen, investor attention turned toward consumption-driven sectors. Autos and real estate attracted increased buying interest, while export-oriented segments such as IT and pharma gained from improved global liquidity and progress in U.S.- India trade talks. Valuation discipline remained evident, with profit booking in overvalued counters and renewed buying in attractively priced segments like PSU banks."" ""Going forward, investors will closely track key U.S. macro indicators—including GDP, jobless claims, and core inflation—for cues on the Fed’s policy trajectory. On the domestic front, the upcoming manufacturing PMI will serve as a timely barometer of industrial sentiments, offering early signs of a much-awaited demand revival. With resilient domestic fundamentals and a weakening U.S. dollar, conditions appear favourable for renewed FII inflows, which could further boost Indian equities in the week ahead,"" he added. The BSE Small-cap index added 2 percent with IRM Energy, Banco Products (India), Sindhu Trade Links, Hi-Tech Pipes, Ramco System, Redington, Welspun Enterprises, Redtape, Shalimar Paints, Bajaj Consumer Care adding 15-36 percent, while Balmer Lawrie Investment, LE Travenues Technology (IXIGO), KRBL, KR Rail Engineering, Dreamfolks Services fell between 9-12 percent.  Where is Nifty50 headed? Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities Indian equity markets delivered positive weekly returns amid broader strength in the global equities. Rally in the global markets was supported by the 25 bps rate cut announced by the US Fed. In India, the larger indices like Nifty 50 and Sensex 30 moved higher this week by around 1%. The midcap and small-cap index outperformed the larger peers with BSE Midcap and BSE Small-cap index posting weekly gains of 1.5-2%. In view of positive momentum, almost all the key sectoral indices posted positive returns. BSE Realty index led with gains of 4% whereas the FMGC index was an underperformer with flattish returns. India’s CPI inflation was 2.1% in August, as food prices contracted by 0.7%. The GST rate cuts is expected to keep the inflation trajectory under control in the next few quarters. GST rate cut comes into effect from next week and that is expected to keep consumption and other stocks benefiting from lower GST rate in focus. Markets would continue to look for clarity on the US tariff situation and its impact on economic growth. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities Nifty slipped on Friday after forming a hanging man pattern in the previous session. While the short-term trend continues to favor the bulls, a mild pullback from the current level looks possible. On the lower side, support is placed at 25,150, below which the trend may weaken. However, if the index manages to stay above 25,150, it could move towards 25,500. A decisive move above 25,500 may then open the road to 26,000. Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities Technically, this market action indicates a formation of short-term top reversal pattern. Larger degree bullish pattern like higher tops and bottoms is intact on the daily chart and further weakness from here could form a new higher bottom of the pattern. Nifty on the weekly chart formed a long bull candle this week which is for the third consecutive sessions. The near-term uptrend of Nifty remains intact. Further consolidation or minor dip could be a buying opportunity by next week. Immediate support is placed at 25150 and a sustainable move above 25500 could pull Nifty towards the next hurdle of 25700 levels. Amol Athawale, VP Technical Research, Kotak Securities We are of the view that the short-term market outlook remains bullish, but due to temporary overbought conditions, range-bound activity may occur in the near future. Hence, buying on dips and selling on rallies would be the ideal strategy for traders. For traders, the key support zones are around 25,200/82300 and 25,150-25,100/82100-81900, while resistance levels are at 25,450-25,500/83200-83400 and 25,600/83700. Below 25,100/81900, the uptrend could become vulnerable.

Stocks finish week higher; Wall Street at record highs,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/stocks-finish-week-higher-wall-street-at-record-highs-13562587.html,"Global stocks rose in choppy trading on Friday, on track for a weekly gain, driven by positive sentiment on Wall Street following key central bank decisions. The Federal Reserve cut U.S. interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday, the first easing since December, while Norway and Canada also cut rates. On Wall Street, all three indexes closed at record highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.37% to 46,315.27, the S&P 500 advanced 0.49% to 6,664.36, and the Nasdaq Composite firmed 0.72% to 22,631.48. All three also hit record highs the day before. European shares finished down 0.16%, and for the week were down 0.13%. Japan's Nikkei fell 0.57% after the Bank of Japan decided to start selling its holdings of risky assets. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe hit a fresh record high of 982.29, adding nearly 1% for the week. Investors are betting that central bank rate cuts will boost stocks further. ""The market for the past several weeks has all been focused on and relying on the Fed meeting and the Fed's decision, and there was enough in the decision to leave everyone just slightly disappointed though basically satisfied,"" said Michael Farr, chief executive of investment advisory firm Farr, Miller & Washington in Washington. The Fed stopped short of endorsing market expectations for a clear string of rate cuts, emphasizing a meeting-by-meeting, data-dependent approach. The Fed's tone, along with the wide range of views within the U.S. central bank, disappointed some investors, who had hoped the stock market would be boosted by a rapid shift to lower rates, analysts said. ""Markets have done exceptionally well and now markets are looking for the next driver or the next bit of news,"" Farr said. ""I think as we probably get into earnings season in October, those reports will be more important than ever because we need to see and the Fed needs to see if tariffs are indeed making their way into bottom-line profits."" The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes rose 2.5 basis points to 4.129%. The 2-year note yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations for the Fed, rose 0.6 basis points to 3.574%. ""The short-term momentum is clearly higher and we are playing the market to the upside because that's what the short-term momentum is telling you,"" said Bill Strazzullo, partner and chief market strategist at Bell Curve Trading in Boston. ""But I think it's a lot more complicated now because the Fed clearly has chosen to err on the side of the weaker labor market so that's talking about more rate cuts."" Following their first call in three months, U.S. President Donald Trump said he and Chinese President Xi Jinping made progress on a TikTok agreement and would meet face-to-face in six weeks in South Korea to discuss trade, illicit drugs and Russia's war in Ukraine. A stopgap spending bill that would avert an October 1 government shutdown fell short in the U.S. Senate on Friday. The bill had been passed by the House of Representatives. The U.S. dollar index rose for a third straight session, up 0.33% to 97.67, but was still set to notch a third straight week of losses. The dollar strengthened 0.4% to 0.795 against the Swiss franc , but was down 0.03% to 147.97 against the Japanese yen . The euro fell 0.35% against the dollar to $1.1745. The British pound fell 0.64% to $1.3467 . The Bank of England kept rates on hold on Thursday, but slowed the pace at which it is unloading the government bonds it purchased in previous crises. Oil prices settled lower as traders' worries about fuel demand outweighed the typical boost from a U.S. rate cut. Brent crude futures fell 1.1% to settle at $66.68 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures lost 1.4%, to $62.68. Gold was up 1.04% at $3,681.79, notching its fifth straight week of gains."
