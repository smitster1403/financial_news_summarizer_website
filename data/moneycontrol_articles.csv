Broader indices snap 2-week gains; 15 small caps record double digit fall,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/broader-indices-snap-2-week-gains-15-small-caps-record-double-digit-fall-13504585.html,"The broader indices underperformed the main indices and snapped two-week gaining streak in the week ended August 29 with BSE Small and Mid-cap indices falling 3 percent each, while Large-cap index shed 2 percent. For the week, the BSE Sensex index shed 1,497.2 points or 1.84 percent to close at 79,809.65 and Nifty50 lost 443.25 points or 1.78 percent to end at 24,426.85. However, in the month of August, Sensex fell 1.7 percent, and Nifty index was down 1.4 percent. The Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) extended their selling on 9th consecutive week, as they sold equities worth Rs 21,151.90 crore. On the other hand, Domestic Institutional Investors (DII) continued their buying in 20th consecutive week, as they bought equities worth Rs 28,645.04 crore. In this month of August, FII offloaded equities worth Rs 46,902.92 crore and DII bought equities worth Rs 94,828.55 crore. On the sectoral front, Nifty Realty index shed more than 4 percent, Nifty Defence index fell 4 percent, Nifty PSU Bank index shed 3.5 percent, Nifty Oil & Gas index slipped 3 percent. On the other hand, Nifty FMCG index added 0.7 percent. ""In the last week, the benchmark indices witnessed selling pressure at higher levels. The Nifty ended 1.8 percent lower, while the Sensex declined by 1500 points. Among sectors, the Capital Market Index lost the most, declining by 7.5 percent, whereas some buying was seen in selective FMCG stocks, resulting in the FMCG Index gaining 0.67 percent. Technically, on weekly charts, it has formed a long bearish candle and also a lower top formation, which is largely negative,"" said Amol Athawale, VP technical Research, Kotak Securities. ""We are of the view that the market's short-term outlook remains weak, but a fresh selloff is possible only if the level of 24,330/79700 is breached. On the other hand, above 24,550/80500, the pullback rally could continue up to the 20-day SMA (Simple Moving Average) or 24,700/81000 and 24,800/81300,"" he added. ""On the downside, if the market falls below 24,330/79700, it could slip to the 200-day SMA or around 24,070/78900. Further downside may also continue, which could drag the market down to 23,900/78400."" ""For Bank Nifty, if it sustains above 53,500, a pullback move is likely to continue toward 54,500–55,000–55,800. Conversely, if it falls below 53,500, it could decline toward the 200-day SMA or around 53,000–52,800,"" Athawale added further. The BSE Small-cap index shed 3 percent with Blue Jet Healthcare, Vishnu Prakash R Punglia, Angel One, Sterlite Technologies, Panama Petrochem, Ethos, Shankara Building Products, Shiva Cement, Sai Life Sciences, Nelcast, Technocraft Industries (India), Gokaldas Exports, GOCL Corporation, Faze Three, Ramky Infrastructure falling between 10-13%. On the other hand, Sadhana Nitrochem, Kabra Extrusion Technik, Rattanindia Enterprises, Permanent Magnets, Jindal Poly Films, Timex Group India, Edelweiss Financial Services, Advanced Enzyme Technologies, Apollo Micro Systems, Kolte-Patil Developers, S H Kelkar & Company, Seamec added between 10-21%.  Where is Nifty50 headed? Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking The ongoing decline appears to be more sentiment-driven in the absence of fresh positive triggers. Notably, the Nifty is now approaching a critical support zone at 24,250–24,350. Meanwhile, the banking index has almost tested its major support around the 200 DEMA at 53,600, which could prompt some pause or even a rebound. That said, participants should continue to adopt a cautious approach, with greater emphasis on risk management, until there are clear signs of a consolidation. Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities The downside momentum continued in the market on Friday and Nifty closed the day lower by 74 points amidst choppy movement. A small negative candle was formed on the daily chart with long upper shadow. Technically, this market action indicates weak bounce and sell on rise in the market. Hence, one may expect some more weakness in the coming week. Nifty is nearing a crucial lower support around 24300-24200 levels (previous swing low and 200day EMA), but a sustainability above the said supports could be doubtful. Hence, a decisive move below 24200, the Nifty could slide down to the next lows of around 24000-23900 levels in the near term. However, a strong upside momentum above the hurdle of 24700 could change the sentiment in favor of bulls. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The RSI is in a bearish crossover, indicating sustained weakness. In the short term, the trend may remain weak, potentially dragging Nifty towards the 200 DMA placed at 24,071. On the lower end, support is placed at 24,400/24,150, while on the higher end, resistance is seen at 24,650. A “sell on rise” strategy remains preferable as long as the index stays below 24,850.

(KSSL) to refund funds raised through non-convertible debentures (NCDs) issued in 2017-18, along with 15 percent annual interest, after finding violations in the debt issuance process. In a 55-page order, Sebi’s Quasi-Judicial Authority, Santosh Shukla, in his order said, KSSL had mobilised funds through NCDs purportedly issued as a private placement to Karvy Capital Ltd., but the securities were later transferred to more than 200 investors, effectively making it a public offer. The regulator held that the company bypassed disclosure and compliance requirements mandated under the Companies Act and SEBI’s debt regulations. SEBI’s directions: Sebi directed that KSSL must refund investors the money collected via NCDs in FY 2017-18, together with 15 percent per annum interest from the eighth day of collection till actual repayment. Also, the company must publish a notice in all editions of two national dailies (one English and one Hindi) and in a widely circulated local newspaper, within 15 days, detailing the modalities for repayment and providing contact details for investor queries. Sebi said, mode of refunds, including principal and interest, must be made only via verifiable banking channels such as demand drafts, pay orders, or electronic fund transfers, ensuring a clear audit trail to identify beneficiaries. Sebi also barred the former promoter, Rahul Dilip Shah, for six months from accessing the securities market. Sebi order said, Shah is directed not to, directly or indirectly, access the securities market, by issuing prospectus, offer document and is restrained from soliciting money from the public in contravention of law, directly or indirectly and is restrained and prohibited from buying, selling or otherwise dealing in the securities market, directly or indirectly in any manner whatsoever, for a period of six months from the date of this order The order comes in the wake of a complaint by former promoter Rahul Dilip Shah, who had alleged irregularities in the pledge of his shares and collusion between Karvy and the majority shareholder group. Sebi’s probe into the NCD issuance established that investor funds were raised in a manner that circumvented regulatory safeguards."
"Sebi passes order against Sanjay Dalmia and others in Golden Tobacco case, imposes penalty and bars from market",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sebi-passes-order-against-sanjay-dalmia-and-others-in-golden-tobacco-case-imposes-penalty-and-bars-from-market-13503040.html,"The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has passed a fresh order in the case of Golden Tobacco Limited (GTL), alleging fund diversion and misstatement of financials over the years. The order, issued on Friday, comes after a detailed investigation into alleged diversion of assets, misstatements and lapses in disclosures by the company and its key officials. In its order, Sebi restrained Sanjay Dalmia, promoter of GTL, from accessing the securities market for a period of 2 years. The regulator also imposed a penalty of Rs 30 lakh on him for violations of the Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices (PFUTP) Regulations and the Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements (LODR) Regulations.  Similarly, Anurag Dalmia, another promoter and director, has been barred from the securities market for one-and-half year and fined Rs 20 lakh. The order also names Ashok Kumar Joshi, a former director of GTL, who has been prohibited from accessing the capital markets for one year and also ordered to pay a penalty of Rs 10 lakhs . As per the Sebi order, GTL transferred Rs.175.17 crore to its subsidiary GRIL during the period FY10 to FY15 in the form of loans and advances and has been showing as outstanding in its annual reports. Sebi alleged that out of the total advance only Rs 36 crore was returned and the rest of the funds were diverted from GRIL to the promoter related entities. Sebi alleged that the promoters and directors of GTL had entered into agreements relating to the company’s prime land assets without proper disclosures to shareholders. These included arrangements with third parties for sale or lease of land that were either not executed in the company’s best interest or were not transparently disclosed to the stock exchanges. Sebi’s Quasi-Judicial Authority, N Murugan, noted in the order, “from the connection established among the promoter entities, they have been benefitted by the said diversion of funds”. He further noted that, “I also note that GTL is not a party/notice in the present proceedings. The promoter- connected entities are also not party in these proceedings. In view of this, no direction can be contemplated against GTL or the promoter connected entities”. Order noted, the funds diverted should be indirectly attributable to the shareholders. From that perspective, it can be considered as loss to the shareholders of GTL notionally GTL, once known for its cigarette brands like Panama and Chancellor, had over the years transitioned into a company with significant real estate holdings, particularly in Mumbai and Delhi. In 2022, the company was admitted into insolvency after National Company Law Tribunal, Ahmedabad  ordered for commencement of Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) against the company. Sebi had previously also passed adjudication orders against Anurag Dalmia, Sanjay Dalmia in October 25, 2013 and against others in February 14, 2014."
S&P 500 ends lower as Dell and Nvidia drop,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/s-p-500-ends-lower-as-dell-and-nvidia-drop-13503047.html,"The S&P 500 ended down from record highs on Friday, with losses in Dell, Nvidia and other AI-related stocks, while investors parsed inflation data showing tariffs have started feeding into prices. Dell tumbled almost 9% and was among the deepest decliners in the S&P 500 after high manufacturing costs for AI-optimized servers and intensifying competition overshadowed the company's bullish demand forecast for artificial intelligence infrastructure. Nvidia dipped 3.4%, down for a third straight day. The AI heavyweight's quarterly report on Wednesday fell short of investors' high expectations but confirmed that spending related to artificial intelligence infrastructure remains strong. ""Today is just weakness in the top of the market, in tech,"" said Zachary Hill, head of portfolio management at Horizon Investments in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""This is not the first time that we've had some worries about over-investment in AI, lack of monetization opportunities and that type of thing."" S&P 500 components so far in 2025 U.S. consumer spending increased by the most in four months in July while services inflation picked up, but economists did not believe the signs of strong domestic demand would prevent the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates next month against a backdrop of softening labor market conditions. The report from the Commerce Department on Friday showed mild price pressures from tariffs on imports. A U.S. tariff exemption for package imports valued under $800 also ended on Friday, raising costs for businesses and, in turn, consumers. Traders widely expect the Fed will cut interest rates by 25 basis points at its September meeting. ""Even if we see an uptick in inflation, which it looks like we are, the Fed may look past that, given that this is going to be tariff-related and temporary,"" said Jim Smigiel, chief investment officer at SEI. The U.S. stock market will be closed on Monday for the Labor Day holiday. Expectations of interest rate cuts helped lead the benchmark S&P 500 and the blue-chip Dow to their fourth straight month of gains, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq logged its fifth consecutive monthly rise. U.S. shares of Alibaba soared 13% and were among the most-traded on Wall Street after the Chinese company reported stronger-than-expected quarterly growth in its cloud computing business, driven by AI-related demand. As well, the Wall Street Journal reported that Alibaba has developed a new AI chip. The S&P 500 declined 0.64% to end the session at 6,460.26 points a day after notching a record-high close. The Nasdaq declined 1.15% to 21,455.55 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.20% to 45,544.88 points. Six of the 11 S&P 500 sector indexes rose, led by healthcare, up 0.73%, followed by a 0.64% gain in consumer staples. The S&P 500 technology index fell 1.63%. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies dipped 0.5%, and it logged a 7% gain in August. For the month, the S&P 500 rose 1.9%, the Dow rose 3.2% and the Nasdaq added 1.6%. Fed Governor Christopher Waller, a candidate for the central bank's top job, said on Thursday he wants to start cutting rates next month, in line with President Donald Trump's calls to lower borrowing costs. A court hearing on Trump's attempt to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook ended on Friday with no immediate ruling from the judge hearing the unprecedented legal fight, meaning the U.S. central bank policymaker will remain in place for now. Chipmaker Marvell slumped almost 19% after forecasting quarterly revenue below expectations. Global economy bellwether Caterpillar dropped 3.65% a day after the heavy-equipment maker forecast higher tariff-related expenses for 2025.Advancing issues outnumbered falling ones within the S&P 500 by a 1.3-to-one ratio. The S&P 500 posted 21 new highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq recorded 76 new highs and 67 new lows. Volume on U.S. exchanges was relatively light, with 14.8 billion shares traded, compared to an average of 16.4 billion shares over the previous 20 sessions."
Sebi extends digital accessibility compliance timelines for investment advisors and research analysts,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sebi-extends-digital-accessibility-compliance-timelines-for-investment-advisors-and-research-analysts-13502438.html,"The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has extended compliance timelines and revised reporting requirements for investment advisors (IAs) and research analysts (RAs) under its framework on digital accessibility. The decision comes less than a month after the regulator mandated that all regulated entities align their digital platforms with the provisions of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 and related rules. In a circular issued on Friday, Sebi said that the deadlines applicable to IAs and RAs for submitting reports and completing specific obligations under the July 31 accessibility framework have been relaxed. The move is aimed at providing additional time to these entities to adapt their systems and processes, given the operational challenges raised by industry participants. Market participants had raised the issue of implementation with Moneycontrol. The deadline for submitting a compliance or action-taken report with respect to the earlier set for August 30, has now been extended to September 30, 2025. The same timeline also applies for submission of the list of digital platforms offered by entities to investors. Also read: Is Sebi revisiting F&O suitability? Recent remarks indicate entry criteria discussion is back on table and here's how it could look The appointment of IAAP-certified accessibility professionals as auditors has been extended by three months, with the new deadline now December 14, 2025. The deadline for conducting accessibility audits of digital platforms has also been pushed to April 30, 2026. Further, remediation of audit findings and ensuring compliance with the circular has been extended until July 31, 2026. The requirement to conduct annual accessibility audits of all digital platforms and submit the final report to Sebi has also been deferred by a year, with the new deadline set for April 30, 2027. The July 31 circular had laid out a phased roadmap requiring regulated entities to list all their digital platforms, appoint an Independent Accessibility Audit Professional (IAAP), conduct audits, and complete remediation to make websites and mobile applications compliant. It also mandated annual reporting on accessibility compliance and designated nodal officers for grievance redressal. Also read: Sebi panel recommends open offer process may be faster with quicker payout to investors With the latest update, Sebi has also clarified the reporting authority for IAs and RAs. The regulator has realigned the compliance submission process, shifting reporting obligations of stock brokers and depository participants to stock exchanges and depositories, of IA and RAs to BSE Limited instead of BASL and MIIs and other regulated entities to Sebi. The extension underscores Sebi’s intent to balance inclusivity with practical implementation. The revised timelines and updated reporting framework are expected to ease the compliance burden on IAs and RAs while reinforcing Sebi’s broader push for inclusive finance and investor protection."

Top gainers and losers: Stocks that moved the most on August 29,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/top-gainers-and-losers-stocks-that-moved-the-most-on-august-29-13500853.html,"The Sensex slipped 270 points on Friday to close at 79,809.65, as renewed concerns over fresh US tariffs on Indian exports dampened risk appetite and kept foreign inflows subdued. Market breadth was weak, with 12 of 16 sectoral indices closing lower, underscoring broad-based pressure. Still, there were pockets of resilience. Consumer-oriented stocks gained nearly 0.6%, supported by expectations that the upcoming GST Council meeting may bring in measures favourable to the sector. On the index front, ITC and HDFC Bank provided notable support. Defensives and financials showed some resilience, but the overall mood stayed cautious. Top GainersRBL Bank (CMP: Rs 261.05 ; up by 4.07%)  RBL Bank shares went up by around 4.3% following Societe Generale's bulk purchase of 32.78 lakh shares at Rs 250.57 per share. This substantial institutional buying signaled confidence in the bank's prospects, giving a positive boost to its share price today.Thejo Engineering (CMP: Rs 1939.30 ; up by 1.01%)  Thejo Engineering shares rose about 4% due to plans for manufacturing expansion and technology upgrades, which investors expect will drive capacity growth and strengthen the company's competitive position in the market.ITC Ltd (CMP: Rs 409.75 ; up by 2.21%)  ITC gained over 2% today. The stock saw buying interest backed by steady domestic demand and optimism about the company’s diversified portfolio in FMCG, cigarettes, and packaged foods. ITC’s dividend yield and stable earnings outlook kept investor sentiment positive despite broader market weakness.Shriram Finance (CMP: Rs 580.25 ; up by 1.50%)  The gains were supported by expectations of a good quarter from the NBFC sector, along with improved credit demand and pickup in loans. Institutional buying and stability in the finance sector also helped its stock price. 5. Larsen & Toubro (CMP: Rs 3,601 ; up by 1.15%) The stock benefited from optimism around the company’s capital goods and infrastructure projects, which are expected to see steady execution and revenue inflows in the coming quarters.Top LosersShanthala FMCG Products (CMP: Rs 38.50 ; down by 3.87%)The stock saw a steep decline of 12% at intraday and has been away from its 52-week high for a while now, with promoters recently increasing their holding. The stock came under pressure due to thin liquidity and heightened volatility in smaller counters, with no major company-specific developments to support buying interest. 2. GSS Infotech (CMP: Rs 28.66 ; down by 12.62%) The fall is attributed to weak market sentiment for technology stocks and lack of any positive triggers or news, leading to profit booking after a recent upmove. The company reported a consolidated net loss in its recent earnings, with standalone net sales for June 2025 down 6.97% year-over-year (announced on August 6, 2025). 3. KCK Industries (CMP: Rs 44.20 ; down by 9.15%) KCK Industries is seeing continued low trading volumes and little investor interest, which has caused increased volatility and sharp downward movement. No major fundamental news combined with technical weakness and sector-specific selling activity likely drove the fall, with its intraday lowest being at -9.20%. 4. Adani Enterprises (CMP: 2,244.70 ; down by 1.34%) The decline is linked to broader market weakness and some profit booking following prior gains. The stock fell as low as 1.55% at intraday. The modest drop is part of a continued multi-day decline (six consecutive sessions of losses in late August), amid broader Adani group pressures. 5. Apollo Hospitals (CMP: Rs 7,610 ; down by 1.53%) The fall is related to profit booking after recent gains and uncertain outlook in the healthcare sector. The stock fell as much as 2% during trading today. The drop occurred on the day of the company's AGM (August 29, 2025), where a Rs 10 per share final dividend for FY25 was up for approval amid strong prior Q4 growth.

Click to View More Outlook for September 1 Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets began the new derivatives series on a muted note, extending the prevailing corrective phase. After an initial uptick, the Nifty traded in a narrow range for most of the session; however, selling pressure in select heavyweights during the closing hours dragged the index lower. Consequently, it settled near the day’s low at 24,426.85, down 0.30%. Sector-wise, barring FMCG, all major sectors ended in the red, with realty, IT, and auto leading the decline. The broader indices also mirrored this trend, losing nearly half a percent each. The ongoing decline appears to be more sentiment-driven in the absence of fresh positive triggers. Notably, the Nifty is now approaching a critical support zone at 24,250–24,350. Meanwhile, the banking index has almost tested its major support around the 200 DEMA at 53,600, which could prompt some pause or even a rebound. That said, participants should continue to adopt a cautious approach, with greater emphasis on risk management, until there are clear signs of a consolidation. Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities The downside momentum continued in the market on Friday and Nifty closed the day lower by 74 points amidst choppy movement. After opening on a weak note, the market made an attempt to bounce back in the early to mid-part of the session. The selling pressure has emerged towards the end and the markets closed at the lows. A small negative candle was formed on the daily chart with long upper shadow. Technically, this market action indicates weak bounce and sell on rise in the market. Hence, one may expect some more weakness in the coming week. Nifty is nearing a crucial lower support around 24300-24200 levels (previous swing low and 200day EMA), but a sustainability above the said supports could be doubtful. Hence, a decisive move below 24200, the Nifty could slide down to the next lows of around 24000-23900 levels in the near term. However, a strong upside momentum above the hurdle of 24700 could change the sentiment in favor of bulls.

Is Sebi revisiting F&O suitability? Recent remarks indicate entry criteria discussion is back on table and here's how it could look,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/is-sebi-revisiting-f-o-suitability-recent-remarks-indicate-entry-criteria-discussion-is-back-on-table-and-here-s-how-it-could-look-13500091.html,"Recent speeches by Sebi Chairman Tuhin Kanta Pandey and Whole Time Member Ananth Narayan G suggest that the regulator may reconsider its stand on product suitability and entry barriers for Futures & Options (F&O). The process, if revived, will undergo a thorough consultative exercise with exchanges, brokers, and other market participants. Moneycontrol has learned that last year the idea of product suitability was discussed with expert working group. The proposal was to introduce product suitability framework by evaluating various criteria at the time of account opening. Also, based on combination of various financial and non-financial related checks, an overall profile score was to be generated. What kind of entry checks possible? As per the note circulated by Sebi to the expert working group last year, when the proposal was under active consideration, financial and non-financial parameters were suggested. These parameters then envisaged may give some clue about the regulatory thinking. Financial: For the financial criteria the income and tax paid data was to be picked up based on Income Tax Return (ITR). Minimum amount in the bank account for past few months and minimum net worth for writing options was proposed. Non-Financial: Also, there was a non-financial criterion like a mandatory exam, though kind of exam was not elaborated.  Initial cooling off period after account opening before enabling F&O, Mandatory cooling off or closure after losing certain amount in F&O, only permitting Accredited Investors to participate in F&O and a System driven Stop Loss Approach by exchanges or brokers was discussed. But the proposal was abandoned then, as participants wanted to see the regulatory measures initiated especially the steps to curb frenzy on weekly expiry. Regulatory thinking on excessive F&O tradesThe regulatory intent was to ensure that derivatives are accessed only by individuals with the financial capacity to handle leveraged products amid volatility. Sebi has repeatedly stressed that ease of account opening and digitisation should not give unqualified investors exposure to complex products. The aim is to reduce the number of small traders incurring heavy losses by consolidating participation among investors and institutions with stronger financial capacity and market knowledge. Retail traders’ losses in F&O and Sebi's concerns Sebi in the note to expert working group said, “Considering growth of derivatives segment over the years combined with increased participation by individual investors in this segment and the poor profitability outcome for them, there is a need to stipulate certain objective criteria for allowing access to this segment”. Sebi’s recent study on F&O trading suggests that 91 percent of traders incurred losses in FY25 in F&O. The study indicates that the net losses of individual traders widened by 41 percent to Rs 1,05,603 crore in FY25 from Rs 74,812 crore in FY24, after accounting for transaction costs. The existing practice of on-boarding clients As per the existing practice, SEBI Circular Aug 22, 2011 mandates brokers to collect documents (ITR, bank statement, net worth certificate) for clients trading in derivatives, but no minimum threshold is specified. Brokers are asked to share risk disclosure documents also, but hardly its explained to the clients. Can the issue be solved without new barriers?Brokers have resisted client profiling, arguing that verifying ITRs and bank accounts is cumbersome. The regulatory view is that if brokers conduct proper profile checks at the onboarding stage and exchanges enforce compliance, the issue could be addressed without new entry barriers. Currently, clients are provided with risk disclosure documents during account opening, but most rarely read them until faced with heavy losses. Also read: Sebi panel recommends, open offer process may be faster with quicker payout to investors South Korean Model for entry check in derivatives South Korea permits only qualified retail investors in its derivatives market through a two-stage entry system. In the first stage, investors must complete an education programme, undergo mock trading, and deposit a minimum margin before being allowed to trade in simple index or stock futures. In the second stage, those with over a year’s trading experience and a higher margin deposit can access more complex products such as structured futures and options. No regulatory change without consultation Though the same proposal of product suitability was abandoned last year due to concerns in implementation from stakeholders, especially from brokers.  Sebi, has again clarified that any regulatory tweak in equity derivatives whether in tenure of contracts or product suitability will not happen without wider consultation. An email seeking comments from Sebi on the issue of product suitability did not elicit any response. Sebi, Chairman, Tuhin Kanta Pandey in his speech at FICCI CAPAM on August 21, said on the issue of equity derivatives, “We will consult with stakeholders on ways to improve, in a calibrated manner, the tenor and maturity profile of derivative products, so that they better serve hedging and long-term investing. Ensuring risk awareness and suitability is equally important and constructive ideas for appropriate stakeholder engagement will be much needed to achieve this goal”. In the same event, Sebi’s Whole Time Member, Ananth Narayan G, also emphasised on the issue of equity derivatives and said, “Equally important is ensuring risk awareness and suitability amongst participants. We are open to objective and simple mechanisms to ensure that derivative participation is informed, suitable, and appropriate. Here again, stakeholder engagement will be key – we are open to all constructive ideas” Sebi had first raised the concern of excessive equity derivative trading, in its July 2017 discussion paper. Even then the issue of product suitability was raised but the proposal could not take off. Also read: Sebi may tweak key norms governing ETF trading to reduce risk, align with real-time conditions"
"FMCG shares rise ahead of next week's GST council meet; Colgate, ITC, HUL gain up to 3%",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/fmcg-shares-rise-ahead-of-next-week-s-gst-council-meet-colgate-itc-hul-rise-up-to-3-13499776.html,"Shares of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies gained in Friday’s trade ahead of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council meeting scheduled for September 3-4. The council, chaired by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, is expected to deliberate on moving to a two-rate structure of 5 percent and 18 percent, with a special levy of 40 per cent on items such as luxury cars and sin goods. At present, GST follows a four-tier structure of 5, 12, 18 and 28 percent. Colgate-Palmolive surged up to 4 percent to an intraday high of Rs 2,357.90 on the NSE after a report said GoM on GST has proposed a GST cut to 5% on toothpaste. Britannia, ITC, Dabur, Patanjali Foods, Emami and Marico advanced between 2 percent and 3 percent. Hindustan Unilever also traded higher. Tracking the movement, the Nifty FMCG index climbed 1.7 percent, with 12 of 15 index constituents trading in the green. GST Council to meet on September 3-4 in New Delhi Items in the 12 percent bracket such as ghee, butter, cheese, paneer, bottled water, juices, instant noodles, pasta, wafers and Chyawanprash could shift to 5 percent if the proposal is cleared. ""Indian FMCG companies are on a structural growth path, with several categories like shampoos and premium detergents still under-penetrated and underserved. Increasing rural penetration further strengthens the sector’s growth potential. Additionally, government tax incentives, potential rate cuts, and the recent GST reduction are expected to further spur consumption,"" said Axis Securities recently. ""FMCG demand remained stable, showing a gradual sequential improvement backed by favorable macros. The rural market continued to perform well, with urban demand also picking up. Our staple companies reported sales growth of 10% (est. 6%), EBITDA was +1% (est. +1%), and APAT was flat YoY (est. +2%). Volume growth for most companies was limited to low- to mid-single digits. The early onset of the monsoon impacted the summer product portfolio of a few consumer companies (Dabur, Emami),"" said Motilal Oswal Financial Services earlier this week. Sanjiv Puri, Chairman, ITC Ltd., said PM's vision to unleash next generation reforms especially in the GST framework is far-sighted and will spur a virtuous cycle of consumption, investment, growth and employment. ""The Government’s resolve to ensure ease of living by enhancing affordability and accessibility of all items meant for daily consumption, including foods, for a large section of society will benefit the sizeable middle-class population, MSME’s and farmers,"" he added. FMCG stocks are seen as key beneficiaries of a rate cut. Food and beverages currently fall under 5, 12 and 18 percent slabs.

The sharp drop in the share prices pushed the capital markets index down into the red for the fourth consecutive session. The Nifty Capital Markets index dropped nearly 2 percent to close at around 4,092. The shares of Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) were the top loser on the index, plunging nearly 4 percent to trade at Rs 2,099 apiece. Motilal Oswal Financial Services shares followed, also dropping nearly 4 percent to close at Rs 857.35 apiece. Nuvama shares fell nearly 3 percent, while Angel One, 360 One WAM and Kfin Technologies shares fell more than 2 percent each. Central Depository Services (CDSL), NAM-India and HDFC AMC shares closed nearly 2 percent lower. UTI AMC, Indian Energy Exchange (IEX), Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC and MCX shares closed in the red with marginal losses. The capital market stocks have remained under pressure recently, as US increased tariffs on Indian imports to a whopping 50 percent. The index has now dropped more than 6 percent in four consecutive sessions so far. The fall in the capital markets stocks comes as benchmark indices closed in the red, erasing all early gains. Sensex fell nearly 271 points (0.34 percent) to 79,809.65, while Nifty 50 fell 74 points (0.30 percent) to 24,426.85. The combined cash market turnover of the BSE and NSE continued to weaken in August, slipping to a six-month low, as volatility in Indian equities kept investor participation subdued. Exchange data analysed by Moneycontrol showed that the average daily turnover in the cash segment has dropped below Rs 1 lakh crore so far in August, marking the lowest level since February. This is also the second consecutive month of decline on a month-on-month basis and down nearly 20 percent from June, underscoring the absence of a strong rally that had previously spurred momentum-driven trading. Instead, benchmark indices have largely moved sideways in recent weeks, leading to muted volumes. Market sentiment has been weighed down by persistent global uncertainty, especially around trade and tariff issues. However, domestic liquidity remains resilient. Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) inflows touched record highs, reflecting continued confidence of retail investors in India’s long-term growth prospects.

The Ahmedabad-based drugmaker plans to file for USFDA approval in the first quarter of 2026, targetting a market projected to reach $10.8 billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 36.3%. The trial met its primary endpoint, with 48.5% of patients on Saroglitazar 1mg achieving a meaningful biochemical response compared with the placebo. The drug also met other key results including complete normalization of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), a critical marker of disease progression. The trial enrolled 149 patients across multiple centers and was designed as a seamless study. Full data will be presented at an upcoming scientific congress, the company said. “Saroglitazar is the first PPAR alpha/gamma agonist to demonstrate positive Phase 3 data in PBC,” said Pankaj Patel, Chairman of Zydus Lifesciences. “It has the potential to bring real value to patients and providers who need more options.” PBC affects thousands globally and is often resistant to first-line of therapy using ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). Saroglitazar, which targets both bile acid toxicity and liver inflammation, has received Orphan Drug and Fast Track designations from the USFDA. “In clinical practice, we often see patients who continue to struggle despite being on standard therapy,” said Dr. Raj Vuppalanchi, Global Principal Investigator for the EPICS-III study. “Expanding our treatment options could significantly change how we personalize care for PBC.” Zydus Therapeutics is focused on rare and serious liver conditions, including PBC and Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH). The company leverages a global R&D network of over 1,300 researchers and 30 manufacturing sites.

"Garment, footwear shares rise on hopes that lower GST may spur demand; Trent, Relaxo among key gainers",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/garment-footwear-shares-rise-on-hopes-that-lower-gst-may-spur-demand-trent-relaxo-among-key-gainers-13499019.html,"Shares of textile and footwear companies were sharply higher in early trade on August 29, in anticipation of benefits from the proposed GST rate rationalisation, which will be taken up by the GST Council next week. News reports suggest that the Group of Ministers (GoM) on rate rationalisation may propose to the council to reduce GST on textile products such as glimped yarn, metallised yarn and rubber thread to 5 percent from the current 12 percent. The panel is also expected to recommend raising the price threshold for readymade garments attracting 5 percent GST to Rs 2,500 from Rs 1,000. Garments priced above Rs 2,500 could attract 18 percent GST compared to 12 percent at present, CNBC-TV18 reported citing people familiar with the developments. For footwear, GST on items priced above Rs 2,500 is likely to be increased to 18 percent from 12 percent. Anticipating these changes, shares of Trent were higher by over 3 percent, making it one of the top gainers on the Nifty 50 index. Siyaram Silk Mills gained 3.55 percent to touch an intraday high of Rs 630 on expectations of higher sales following a lower GST slab. Indiamart Intermesh and Avenue Supermarts also saw buying interest, rising up to a percent intraday. Among footwear stocks, Relaxo Footwears surged 9.34 percent while Khadim India advanced more than 10 percent. The buying comes amid recent declines in textile and leather shares following the imposition of a steep 50 percent tariff on Indian goods entering the United States.

"Yes Bank shares jump 4% after report says SMBC set to infuse Rs 16,000 crore",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/yes-bank-shares-jump-4-after-report-says-smbc-set-to-infuse-rs-16-000-crore-13499072.html,"Yes Bank shares jumped nearly 4 percent in the morning trading hours of August 29. This comes after a report by the Economic Times said that SMBC is set to invest Rs 16,000 crore ($1.83 billion) in the Indian private lender through a combination of equity and debt. The proposed infusion by the Japanese financial giant is aimed at strengthening Yes Bank's balance sheet, and is seen to be a precursor to SMBC taking an ownership position, ET reported, citing people familiar with the matter. The reported infusion will comprise Rs 7,500 crore in equity, and Rs 8,500 crore in debt. This will be in addition to the Rs 13,500 crore that SMBC has committed to pay the lender's existing shareholders, including State Bank of India (SBI) and others, for acquiring a 20 percent stake in Yes Bank, the report further said. The Rs 16,000-crore infusion will be reflected in Yes Bank's books, while the Rs 13,500 crore will be paid to the bank's shareholders to facilitate their exit, according to the report. Moneycontrol couldn't independently verify the report. As part of the debt funding, SMBC will opt for yen-dominated bonds equivalent to Rs 8,500 crore, priced below 2 percent, to ensure low-cost, long-term funding, ET cited a source as saying. The equity infusion of Rs 7,500 crore will be done through a foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs), in order to boost its capital, the source added. Last week, Yes Bank said that the RBI has accorded approval to Japan-based Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC) to acquire up to 24.99 percent stake in the lender. This came after Yes Bank in May disclosed that SMBC proposed to acquire 20 percent holding in the lender through a secondary stake purchase of 13.19 percent stake from the State Bank of India (SBI) and 6.81 percent share from seven other shareholders.

The note said the non-lending businesses within the financial sector such as AMCs and wealth management are expected to grow up to 1.5-1.7 times faster than the lending businesses, showing strong outperformance. Among NBFCs, UBS said it is bullish on Chola Finance and PFC, and prefers SBI Life among its play on insurers. The sector is expected to benefit from a structural shift in household saving and investment pattern. The note added that it sees Paytm's margins improving going forward and raised its target on the stock to s 1250 per share from the previous Rs 1,100 per share. On Kotak Bank, UBS believes the stock is the best way to play the financial services sector, supported by its various subsidiaries, expecting the re-rating in the stock to continue. Kotak's key subsidiaries include Kotak Securities, Kotak AMC, Kotak Life, Kotak Alternate Assets and Kotak Prime. Shares of Kotak Mahindra Bank are higher by over 1.3 percent in early trade on August 29, while the Nifty 50 is marginally in the green and the Bank Nifty is higher by 0.4 percent. During its June quarter earnings call, Kotak Bank had told analysts that it expects the bank's Net Interest Margin (NIM) to stabilize over FY26, and the full benefit of RBI's repo rate cuts would accrue to borrowers in Q2FY26. The lender said it has reduced its unsecured advances from 11.6% to 9.7% by tightening underwriting norms, especially for unsecured business. The bank added that it saw a sequential increase in slippages and credit cost due to its microfinance business and stress in retail commercial vehicle loans, along with a seasonal impact on the rural segment.

"Ola Electric Mobility shares surge 20% this week on PLI boost, GST buzz",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/ola-electric-mobility-shares-surge-20-this-week-on-pli-boost-gst-buzz-13499011.html,"Shares of Ola Electric Mobility rallied as much as 5 percent on Friday to Rs 57.50, taking weekly gains to nearly 20 percent. A mix of policy triggers and company-specific developments fuelled the rally, with the highlight being the company’s Production Linked Incentive (PLI) certification for its Gen 3 scooter portfolio. In an exchange filing on August 26, the EV maker said it had received certification of compliance under the PLI scheme for automobiles and auto components, granted by the Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) under the Ministry of Heavy Industries. The approval covers all seven scooters in Ola’s S1 Gen 3 line-up — including the S1 Pro 3 kWh, S1 Pro 4 kWh, S1 Pro+ 4 kWh, S1 X 2 kWh, S1 X 3 kWh, S1 X 4 kWh and S1 X+ 4 kWh. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates The company noted that both its Gen 2 and Gen 3 scooters are now PLI-certified. With the Gen 3 range accounting for the bulk of Ola’s current sales, management expects the certification to significantly enhance profitability beginning Q2FY26. Another sentiment booster has been the buzz around a possible GST cut on entry-level two-wheelers and EVs. Additionally, reports that Niti Aayog has convened a meeting with leading two-wheeler manufacturers to accelerate the electrification of motorcycle sector lifted optimism this week. Government estimates indicate electric scooters could make up as much as 80 percent of sales by 2030. However, penetration in motorcycles may reach only about 10 percent, keeping the overall two-wheeler electrification rate at roughly 36 percent — well short of policymakers’ ambitions. To bridge this gap, discussions are likely to focus on scaling up production, reducing upfront costs, exploring battery-swapping solutions and offering innovative financing models to make EV motorcycles more competitive.

He said the company’s strategy of vertical integration, coupled with new product launches, will ensure long-term profitability as volumes scale. “Our mojo is still there,” Aggarwal remarked last week, expressing confidence in Ola’s ability to hold margins while chasing growth. At about 10:20 am, shares of the company were trading at Rs 56.1, higher by 2.3 percent from the last close on the NSE.

Navneet Education shares rise 2% on talk of GST rate rejig for stationery items,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/navneet-education-shares-rise-2-on-talk-of-gst-rate-rejig-for-stationery-items-13498707.html,"Shares of Navneet Education rose 2 percent to Rs 156 per share in morning trade on Friday, August 29, after CNBC TV-18 reported that the government is weighing significant changes to GST rates on stationery products. The other potential beneficiary, DOMS Industries, saw selling pressure and traded almost a percent lower in the morning. A panel of ministers on rate rationalisation is expected to present proposals that could see taxes on several items either scrapped or sharply reduced, CNBC TV-18 reported, citing sources. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates According to the proposals, GST on erasers and exercise books may be cut to zero. At the same time, rates on pencils, crayons, sharpeners, maps, atlases and related items could also drop to nil from the current 12 percent. Taxes on products such as mathematical and geometry boxes, as well as colour boxes, may be lowered to 5 percent. It is essential to note that these are preliminary suggestions, and the final decision will be made by the GST Council when it convenes in New Delhi on September 3–4. Also read: What to watch for in Reliance Industries’ 48th AGM? Doms Industries, which makes pencils, drawing books, mathematical sets and a wide range of writing and colouring products, and Navneet Education, a publisher and supplier of educational books and stationery, are seen as direct beneficiaries if the proposals are cleared.

"Sensex, Nifty open flat amid weakness in auto, IT, metal stocks",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sensex-nifty-open-flat-amid-weakness-in-auto-it-metal-stocks-13498586.html,"Benchmark indices Nifty and Sensex opened subdued on Friday, August 29, slipping into a third straight day of losses and setting up a weak close for the week. Decline in IT, auto and metal stocks dragged the markets lower, while broader markets bore the brunt as mid and smallcap indices saw sharper declines. At about 9:30 am, the Sensex was down 7.67 points or 0.01 percent at 80,072.90, and the Nifty was down 1.90 points or 0.01 percent at 24,499.00. About 1517 shares advanced, 1373 shares declined, and 132 shares were unchanged. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates One striking aspect of yesterday’s trade was that despite heavy domestic buying of Rs 6,920 crore, which far outpaced FII selling of Rs 3,856 crore, the Nifty still fell 211 points. The drag came from a build-up of short positions by FIIs, driven by concerns over the 50 percent Trump tariff and stretched valuations in India, V K Vijayakumar of Geojit Investments said. Back home, policy measures like fiscal support through the Budget, monetary easing via rate cuts, and the expected GST rationalisation are likely to bolster growth and corporate earnings in the coming quarters. A sustainable rally will then have stronger fundamentals behind it. In the meantime, investors may look to accumulate fairly valued stocks on market declines and stay patient for the upturn, experts say. Among movers, Navneet Education gaiend up to 2 percent after CNBC TV-18 reported that the Group of Ministers on rate rationalisation may table proposals for a major GST revamp. According to sources, the GST Council could consider revising rates on items such as erasers, maps, atlases, sharpeners, pencils, crayons, exercise books, mathematical sets, geometry boxes and colour boxes. The report added that the proposals include cutting GST on erasers and exercise books to nil, and reducing rates on items like pencils, crayons, sharpeners, maps and geometry boxes from 12 percent to either nil or 5 percent. Bharat Forge shares were down over a percent after Morgan Stanley said that exports to the US made up 38 percent of its standalone revenue in FY25, with about 30 percent of the topline exposed to the recent hike in tariffs from 10 percent to 50 percent. While the company managed to pass on part of the impact in the June quarter when the lower tariffs were in place, the sharper levy could now dent its EBITDA by nearly 30 percent. Technical View ""Technically, this market action indicates a down trend continuation pattern. The crucial support of the previous opening upside gap of 18th Aug has been broken decisively on the downside at 24670, and Nifty closed below it. Another support of the ascending trend line connecting April to Aug 25's bottom has also been broken on the downside. This is not a good sign,"" says Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities. ""The underlying trend of Nifty continues to be negative, and more weakness could be in store for the short term. The next lower supports to be watched are around 24,300-24,250 (previous swing lows and 200-day EMA). Any pullback could find strong resistance around 24,700 levels,"" he added. HUL, Asian Paints, Trent, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Tata Consumer Products, and Shriram Finance were the top gainers on the Nifty. Laggards on the index included Tata Motors, NTPC, ONGC, Hero MotoCorp, and Titan Company.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Caplin Point, Jindal Stainless, Engineers India, Advanced Enzyme, Nykaa, Endurance Tech, and others on August 29?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-caplin-point-jindal-stainless-engineers-india-advanced-enzyme-nykaa-endurance-tech-and-others-on-august-29-13497964.html,"The benchmark indices remained under pressure for the second consecutive session, falling nearly 1 percent on August 28, the F&O expiry day. Bears dominated market breadth with about 1,901 shares declining compared to 835 advancing shares on the NSE. A rebound may be possible after the severe sell-off, but sustainability is the level to watch given the bearish sentiment. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Jay Mehta, Technical Research at JM Financial Services Avenue Supermarts | CMP: Rs 4,700  Avenue Supermarts (DMart) has been consolidating within a triangular pattern since April 2025, characterized by below-average trading volume, suggesting an accumulation phase. On August 18, the stock broke out above this pattern with a breakaway gap, indicating a surge in buying interest. The price is currently trading above all major Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs), supported by a notable increase in volume, which validates the breakout. Momentum indicators display a bullish outlook, reinforcing an upward trajectory toward Rs 4,900 and Rs 5,166. A potential pullback to the Rs 4,440–4,550 support range could present a favourable entry point for buyers. The Average Directional Index (ADX) indicates sustained bullish momentum, with the DMI+ line positioned above the DMI- line. Strategy: Buy Targets: Rs 4,900, Rs 5,166 Stop-Loss: Rs 4,126 Kirloskar Brothers | CMP: Rs 1,985.8  Kirloskar Brothers delivered a significant breakout above a complex bullish head-and-shoulders pattern (not a classical one) on June 23 from the Rs 1,910 level, rallying to Rs 2,475 within just five trading sessions. Since then, the price has trended downward, approaching a retest of the prior breakout zone. Recently, it has established a short-term base near the 200-day EMA, which coincides with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the upward move. Additionally, the stock has broken out above a short-term triangular consolidation pattern. A robust support base is forming around the Rs 1,930–1,960 range, where the 20-day, 50-day, and 100-day EMAs converge. Momentum and trend indicators suggest a continuation of the recent upward momentum. Strategy: Buy Targets: Rs 2,150, Rs 2,280 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,840 Hardik Matalia, Derivative Analyst at Choice Broking Caplin Point Laboratories | CMP: Rs 2,156.2  Caplin Point Laboratories, on the daily chart, had been moving within a parallel channel formation. Recently, it witnessed a breakout from this channel, followed by a retest, and is now showing early signs of reversal, suggesting renewed buying interest at current levels. If the stock sustains a move above the Rs 2,200 mark, it would confirm the breakout and reversal, opening the door for further upside towards the Rs 2,400 level in the near term. Such a move would also validate the completion of the consolidation phase and signal a continuation of the broader positive trend. Momentum indicators also support this view. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 54.76, reflecting a reversal with early signs of a positive crossover, highlighting improving momentum. Additionally, the stock has taken consistent support at its 20-day, 50-day, and 100-day EMAs and is now trading comfortably above all key moving averages, underlining strength in its overall structure. From a price action perspective, the breakout and successful retest provide confidence that bulls are gradually regaining control. This setup offers a favourable risk-reward scenario for traders. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,400 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,040 Engineers India | CMP: Rs 200.3  Engineers India, on the daily chart, has been trending within a falling parallel channel, reflecting a corrective phase. At present, it is on the verge of breaking out of this channel, signaling the possibility of a trend reversal. A sustained move above the Rs 205 mark would confirm the breakout and could trigger further upside momentum. Such a move would indicate the end of the corrective phase and set the stage for a potential rally towards higher levels. Momentum indicators also support this developing setup. The RSI stands at 42.92, showing a strong reversal from lower levels and trending upwards, which highlights improving momentum and buying interest. Furthermore, the stock has reversed from its recent swing lows and is now approaching its key moving averages. A decisive move above these moving averages would further strengthen the bullish outlook. From a technical standpoint, the breakout from the falling channel coupled with supportive momentum suggests that bulls are gradually regaining control. This provides a favourable risk-reward opportunity for traders. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 221 Stop-Loss: Rs 190 Jindal Stainless | CMP: Rs 806.5  Jindal Stainless continues to remain in a strong overall uptrend. Over the past few months, the stock underwent a wide-range consolidation phase, which helped in building a solid base. On the daily chart, this consolidation has taken the shape of a Rounding Bottom formation, a bullish continuation pattern that often precedes further upward movement. Recently, JSL has given a strong breakout from this formation, highlighting the resumption of its bullish momentum. If the stock manages to surpass and sustain above the Rs 820 level, it would confirm the breakout strength and could open the way for a move towards the Rs 895 mark in the near term. Such price action would reaffirm the continuation of its prevailing uptrend. Momentum indicators also support this bullish outlook. The RSI is at 74.69 and continues to trend upwards, reflecting strong buying interest and robust momentum. Furthermore, JSL is comfortably trading above all its key moving averages — short-term, medium-term, and long-term EMAs — underlining the strength of its underlying trend. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 895 Stop-Loss: Rs 765 Om Mehra, Technical Research Analyst at Samco Securities Advanced Enzyme Technologies | CMP: Rs 324.15  Advanced Enzyme Technologies, in the latest session, posted a strong bullish candle backed by a sharp rise in volumes, indicating renewed momentum. After a period of sideways consolidation near the Rs 300 zone, the stock has staged a breakout from its recent base, reaffirming strength in the short term. The price has moved above both the 20-SMA and 50-SMA, signalling an improving outlook and positioning itself for further gains. Momentum indicators support the bullish view. The RSI has rebounded to 54, climbing above the neutral zone and reflecting rising strength. The MACD has turned positive with a fresh crossover, confirming the shift in momentum toward the upside. The breakout zone near Rs 315–320 now acts as a strong support base. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 352 Stop-Loss: Rs 308 FSN E-Commerce Ventures Nykaa | CMP: Rs 233.84  Nykaa continued its upward momentum, advancing and registering its third consecutive positive close. The stock has broken past the consolidation band around Rs 220, confirming a clean breakout that now turns this zone into a strong support base. Sustained trading above the 20-SMA (Rs 216) and Supertrend support adds strength to the prevailing uptrend. The RSI has climbed to 70, showing positive momentum without divergence. The MACD is in a positive crossover, with the histogram expanding steadily, further validating the breakout strength. The higher-high formation and steady volume alongside the rise in price indicate a strengthening trend. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 248 Stop-Loss: Rs 223 Endurance Technologies | CMP: Rs 2,859.70  Endurance Technologies is forming a strong bullish candle that adds weight to its emerging cup and handle pattern on the daily chart. The stock has been consolidating above the 20-SMA and 50-SMA while also maintaining a firm hold above the Supertrend support, indicating strength in the medium-term uptrend. The RSI has climbed to 64, and the MACD is skewed to the higher side. Volume remains steady alongside the price increase.

The case pertained to violations of the Alternative Investment Funds (AIF) Regulations, 2012. Sebi observed that 360 One Private Equity Fund, through its scheme 360 One Seed Ventures Fund 1, had simultaneously accepted investments from other AIFs while also investing in units of AIFs. This breached Regulation 15(1)(da) of the AIF Regulations. The fund manager and Kohli were also held liable for additional violations under Regulations 20(1), 20(5) and clauses of the code of conduct. The matter came to light in June 2023 when the scheme’s filings disclosed investments of Rs 54.19 crore in AIFs, despite having an AIF investor within the scheme. The non-compliance was later corrected on October 30, 2024, but Sebi initiated an examination and found grounds for enforcement action. On December 23, 2024, Sebi issued a Notice of Summary Settlement to the Fund, its manager, and Kohli, followed by a Supplementary Notice on March 20, 2025. The regulator offered settlement upon payment of Rs 14.62 lakh jointly and severally, in line with the Sebi (Settlement Proceedings) Regulations, 2018. The three applicants opted for the summary settlement route and remitted the prescribed amount within the stipulated 30-day period. Sebi confirmed receipt and, on August 28, 2025, passed a formal order. The case highlights Sebi’s increasing scrutiny of AIFs, which have grown rapidly in recent years. With rising concerns over inter-fund investments and structural complexities, Sebi has been tightening compliance and disclosure norms to enhance transparency. "
"Sensex falls 1,500 points in two days, Nifty at 24,500 amid additional US tariffs; experts suggest these strategies for index traders",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sensex-falls-1-500-points-in-two-days-nifty-at-24-500-amid-additional-us-tariffs-experts-suggest-these-strategies-for-index-traders-13496872.html,"Indian stocks recorded strong losses on August 28, closing in the deep red for the second consecutive session after US increased tariffs on Indian imports to a whopping 50 percent. Analysts expect the downturn to continue, although some say that chances for a sharp rally cannot be ruled out. Sensex dropped nearly 706 points (nearly 0.9 percent) to close at 80,080.57. Sensex has now fallen more than 1,500 points over the past two sessions on tariff jitters. Nifty 50 meanwhile fell more than 211 points (0.85 percent) to end today's session at 24,500.90. All sectoral indices closed in the red, except consumer durables. Nifty Bank plunged more than 1 percent (over 630 points) to close at 53,820.35, with private lenders leading losses. What lies ahead? Today's dip in the equity markets was indeed larger that what was expected, said Osho Krishan, Senior Analyst of Technical & Derivatives at Angel One. ""Although initial lows were quickly recouped, the rebound proved to be short-lived, as bearish sentiment prevailed, resulting in the Nifty index falling below the 100-day EMA,"" the analyst explained. According to Krishnan, 24,350 is expected to function as a critical support level for Nifty tomorrow. If Nifty falls below this level, it can then fall to as low at 24,100. If the index shows any rebound, investors must analyse that thoroughly due to the lack of favorable macroeconomic developments, he added while painting a bleak technical outlook for the benchmark index. ""In terms of levels, 24,700-24,800 appears to be an intermediate obstacle, and it is advisable to consider reducing long positions on any bounce for the time being,"" he further said. For Bank Nifty, Krishnan suggested resistance at 54,250 – 54,500, and support at 53,600 – 53,400. 'Quick pullback rally cannot be ruled out' Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research at Kotak Securities, however said that a quick pullback rally from the current levels cannot be ruled out as market is currently oversold, although the short-term market outlook is weak. The weak market sentiment will likely continue as long as Nifty remains below 24,600 and Sensex below 80,600, he said, while adding that the benchmark indices can slip to as low as 24,300 and 79,700 respectively. ""On the flip side, if the market moves above 24,600/80600, the pullback could extend up to the 20-day SMA (Simple Moving Average) or 24,725/81000. Further upside may also continue, potentially lifting the market up to 24,800/81300,"" he added. 'Nifty must begin forming higher high and higher low to pause the current drop' Bajaj Broking noted that the technical charts for Nifty 50 signal continuation of the corrective decline. It said that it has formed a ""second consecutive sizable bear candle with a lower high and lower low"". In order to pause the current drop, Nifty needs to start forming higher high and higher low in the daily chart, Bajaj Broking said. ""Nifty has immediate support base placed at 24,400-24,350 levels being the confluence of the recent lows and the key retracement area. Index holding above the same will lead to a consolidation in the range of 24,400-24,900. While failure to do so will signal acceleration of decline towards 24,000-23,800 levels being the confluence of the 52 weeks EMA and the previous major lows and the previous major breakout area,"" it noted. In its technical analysis for Bank Nifty, the domestic brokerage said that the bank index also has formed a lower high and lower low, signaling continuation of the corrective decline. ""Going ahead, failure to move above 55,000 will keep the bias down and will open downside towards 53,500-53,000 levels in the coming sessions. Key support is placed at 53,500-53000 levels being the confluence of the 200 days EMA and the low of May 2025,"" it added. Despite the downturn, market experts believe that an India-US trade deal may soon be reached and Indian economy remains support, which will soon lead to recovery in the market after the current dip. Market expert Madhusudan Kela said the current downturn in the stock markets is only temporary, and investors should use this dip to buy stocks, which have undergone strong price correction. Speaking to CNBC Awaaz, he added, ""Prime Minister Narendra Modi has handled several such crises in the past in a very decisive way. I don't think there is anything to worry that much about.""

Oncology emerges as top revenue and profitability driver for India’s leading hospital chains,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/oncology-emerges-as-top-revenue-and-profitability-driver-for-india-s-leading-hospital-chains-13497072.html,"India’s top hospital chains are witnessing a structural shift in their revenue mix, with oncology emerging as the fastest-growing and most profitable specialty. Once a niche segment, cancer care is now central to the strategic plans of Max Healthcare, Apollo Hospitals, and Fortis Healthcare, among others, driven by rising incidence, improved diagnostics, and high-complexity treatments that command premium pricing. “Oncology clearly is growing faster for us,” said Abhay Soi, Chairman and MD of Max Healthcare. “We are making significant investments in radiation oncology infrastructure, especially in Lucknow and Dwarka, where new bunkers are being commissioned,” he said in a recent interview to Moneycontrol. At Max, oncology now contributes nearly 25 percent of inpatient revenue, making it the largest therapeutic segment. Fortis Healthcare reported 28 percent year-on-year growth in oncology revenue in Q1 FY26, with the segment accounting for 16.4 percent of total hospital income. CEO Dr. Ashutosh Raghuvanshi of Fortis in recent earnings call said that when accounting for oncology-related treatments classified under other specialties, the total revenue contribution is estimated to be around 19 percent to 20 percent, even surpassing cardiology — its largest therapeutic segment — by revenue. Raghuvanshi expects the momentum to continue as Fortis expands oncology setups across its network. “We expect that kind of growth will continue for another few years,” Raghuvanshi said. “We are adding oncology setups to hospitals where it is not there at the moment,” he added. Apollo Hospitals, which pioneered proton therapy in India, sees oncology as both a clinical and commercial imperative. Apollo operates 13 Comprehensive Cancer Centres (CCCs) across 12 cities, equipped with 23–25 LINACs for advanced radiation therapy. “In terms of why is every hospital chasing it (oncology) ..because the volumes are truly large. It's growing at 15 to 18 percent. Environmental stresses are adding to this. And the whole thing about the morbidity can be prevented,” told Suneeta Reddy, Managing Director of Apollo Hospitals to Moneycontrol recently. Oncology is the second largest revenue contributor for Apollo with 17 percent share to its healthcare services business in Q1FY26. “We are helping save lives. We invest in high-end technology. We were able to get the best doctors, able to publish clinical research in the Oncology space and really improve survivorship for patients,” she said. “It fits in very well with Apollo’s ethos of having some purpose before we make investments and grow certain segments,” she added. Hospitals are also investing heavily in infrastructure. Cancer care is more capital intensive than other segments, as it requires expensive radiation therapy, robotic surgery machines, and advanced diagnostics. HCG reported a 17 percent YoY growth in oncology revenue in Q1 FY26, with LINAC (radiation therapy) utilization rising to 69 percent, reflecting strong demand. Why is oncology surging? The growth in oncology is underpinned by factors such as rising cancer incidence, improved screening, insurance penetration, and the inherently high revenue per patient. Cancer care typically involves multidisciplinary teams, advanced diagnostics, and long treatment cycles—making it a high-margin specialty. Treatments such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and robotic surgeries are highly specialized and technology-intensive, which translates into significantly higher revenue per patient or Average Revenue Per Occupied Bed (ARPOB). According to the National Cancer Registry Programme (NCRP) Report 2020, published by the ICMR and the National Centre for Disease Informatics and Research in Bengaluru, the number of cancer cases in 2020 was estimated to be 13.9 lakhs and it is projected to increase to 15.7 lakhs by 2025. The country’s cancer burden is growing at a compound annual rate of 6.8 percent, and experts estimate that actual incidence may be 1.5 to 3 times higher than reported figures due to underdiagnosis and limited registry coverage. Head and neck, gastrointestinal and lung contributes to 50 percent incidences in males and breast, cervix uteri and gastrointestinal organs in case of females. Head and neck, prostate and ovarian cancer are growing at a faster pace than other cancers. As insurance penetration improves through both private and government schemes, more patients can afford advanced oncology procedures, further fueling demand. Moreover, hospitals with strong oncology programs enjoy a reputation premium, allowing them to command better pricing and attract patients seeking high-quality, specialized care. This convergence of clinical need and commercial opportunity is making oncology the centerpiece of growth strategies for India’s leading hospital chains. "

The market opened lower, continuing Tuesday's fall, with Nifty falling below 24,500, intraday, amid selling across the sectors.

Click to View More Outlook for August 29 Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets extended their decline on monthly expiry day, losing nearly a percent and continuing the corrective trend. After a weak opening, the Nifty staged a swift rebound in the initial hours, but sustained pressure from heavyweight stocks across key sectors dragged the index to fresh lows as the session progressed. It eventually settled near the day’s low at 24,500.9. Sectoral performance was broadly weak, with IT, realty, and banking stocks leading the decline. The broader indices also mirrored this trend, with mid- and small-cap segments slipping close to a percent each. Sentiment remained under strain from the implementation of additional 25% U.S. tariff, which, combined with weakness in heavyweights such as banks, is exerting steady pressure on the markets. In the absence of major domestic triggers, global developments continue to drive near-term direction. On the technical front, the Nifty has breached its medium-term support at the 100-day EMA around 24,600. The next support is seen in the 24,250–24,350 zone, which aligns with the previous swing low and the long-term 200-day EMA. On the upside, the 24,650–24,800 region, earlier a support zone, is now likely to act as resistance. Traders are advised to align positions with the prevailing trend and exercise heightened caution in stock selection. Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical Research and Derivatives at SBI Securities Technically, the Nifty is showing strong signs of weakness. The index is now trading below its 20-day, 50-day and 100-day EMAs, all of which have started to edge lower, reflecting a build-up of downward momentum. This alignment of key averages turning south indicates that short-term as well as medium-term trends are under pressure. Adding to the concern, the daily RSI is on the verge of slipping below the crucial 40 mark and continues to remain in a declining trajectory. A breach of this level would further strengthen the bearish undertone, suggesting that momentum is favouring sellers over buyers. From a technical perspective, unless the Nifty reclaims its short-term moving averages with strong volume support, the bias is likely to remain negative in the near term. Going ahead, the 100-day EMA zone of 24630–24650 is expected to act as a crucial hurdle for the Nifty. As long as the index remains below this zone, the overall sentiment is likely to stay weak. On the downside, the index may first drift towards 24350, and a sustained breach of that support could open the gates for a further slide towards the 24200 level. A decisive move above 24650 would be needed to negate the bearish momentum and signal the possibility of a short-term recovery. Until then, the market trend remains tilted in favour of the bears.

The sharp drop in bank stocks pushed the Nifty Bank index down nearly 0.9 percent to stand at 53,969 in the afternoon. ""Bank Nifty continues to remain sluggish. Bank Nifty, with a bearish candle formation, has broken below the important and crucial support zone at the 55,000 level to weaken the bias and sentiment, expecting a further slide with the next major support visible near the 53500 zone. For the bias to improve, the index needs to witness a revival and move past the significant 50EMA level at the 55700 zone to establish some conviction and thereafter expect a further rise in the coming days. Bankex with profit booking witnessed a slip down below the 61000 zone to weaken the bias, and further ahead, a decisive breach below the important support of the 200 DMA level of 59900 shall trigger fresh selling pressure with the next major and crucial support positioned near the 58300 zone. For the bias to improve, the index needs to move past the resistance hurdle of the 50EMA level of 62300 to anticipate further rise in the coming days. BankNifty would have the daily range of 53800-55000 levels,"" said Vaishali Parekh, Vice President - Technical Research at PL Capital, while explaining the technical side of the index. Notably, the Indian government has appointed global investment banking firm Goldman Sachs as the transaction advisor for the stake sale in four public sector banks - UCO Bank, Central Bank of India, Punjab & Sind Bank, and Indian Overseas Bank (IOB). The government will likely dilute its equity stake in each of the four banks by up to 5% over the next two to three years, CNBC-TV18 reported.

Focus on Customised Design and Urban Needs The shortlisted design consultancy will be responsible for analysing project-specific factors, including geological and geotechnical conditions, tunnel geometry, production targets, risks and regulatory requirements. “Based on this analysis, the appropriate TBM type- such as Earth Pressure Balance (EPB), Slurry, Hard Rock, or Dual Mode - will be selected for different Indian conditions, especially in urban areas with mixed-face geology and high groundwater pressure”, the tender document said. BEML said that the TBMs will be designed to minimise settlement impact, reduce noise and vibration, and offer tight turning radius capability for use in densely built environments. “The after-sales service will be rendered by our nationwide service network with the support of the design consultancy firm,” the PSU said in its EoI document.

In 2009, BEML signed a Memorandum of Agreement with France-based NFM Technologies to manufacture TBMs for India and Southeast Asia. However, the partnership stalled in 2018 after NFM was acquired by German firm Mühlhäuser, which shifted focus to the European market. Currently, India relies heavily on imported TBMs, mainly from Herrenknecht (Germany), Terratec (Australia), CRCHI and STEC (China), and Komatsu (Japan), with many of these assembled in China. The recent Indo-China border standoff had disrupted TBM imports, affecting major infrastructure projects such as Mumbai’s underground Metro project.

"JTEKT India, steering supplier to Maruti, abuzz as investor assess e-Vitara order ruboff",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/jtekt-india-steering-supplier-to-maruti-abuzz-as-investor-assess-e-vitara-order-ruboff-13495677.html,"Shares of JTEKT India, a manufacturer of steering systems, are higher by as much as 10 percent in trade on August 28 after investors placed bets on increased orders from Maruti Suzuki for its export-focused SUV, the e-Vitara, for which the ancillary player is a complete supplier. Shares of JTEKT India clocked their best day since May 2023 on very high volumes that have taken the stocks above its 100 and 200-Day Moving Averages. On August 26, Maruti Suzuki inaugurated its electric vehicle (EV) and battery plant in Hansalpur, Gujarat, as well as launched Maruti Suzuki’s first electric vehicle, the e-Vitara, which will be exported to over a hundred countries. Maruti Suzuki has invested about Rs 21,000 crore in the Gujarat facility and plans to invest additional Rs 3,100 crore to add a fourth production line. The company is largely into the manufacturing of high-performance manual steering gear, hydraulic and electric power steering, and other allied components, with leading car companies as clients, including Maruti Suzuki, Toyota, Tata Motors, Mahindra, Honda, Renault, Nissan and others. JTEKT India is a 100% supplier for this new SUV model, e-Vitara, that has been unveiled for exports. ""...whatever exports and domestic production will happen, we will be supplying for that. And the good news is that we are a complete system supplier for this particular product. We will be supplying manual gear. We will be supplying Chemical Process System (CPS), and we will be supplying Constant Velocity Joints (CVJ) also. And we are very hopeful for that. Our lines are ready. We are ready with our production facilities,"" Rajiv Chanana, CFO, JTEKT India said during the March quarter earnings call. In anticipation of an increased order flow from Maruti, JTEKT India has already started work on expanding capacity. Maruti Suzuki contributes 56 percent to JTEKT India's annual revenue. As a component supplier, JTEKT India will be heavily dependent on its OEM's performance and the overall demand outlook. The auto parts maker is looking to ramp up its Constant Velocity Joints (CVJ) business, for which the company has set up a new line at a capex of Rs 100 crore. Assuming a capex of Rs 300 crore for FY26, JTEKT India said it will end up with about Rs 760 crore of capex over a three-year period. ""...currently we are at around 5% market share (in CVJ). I think we should be expanding to within a year or so. We expect that we may touch 7.5%, 10% kind of a number,"" CFO Chanana said in June.

"Concerns of retail response in mega IPOs? Here are 10 IPOs that saw retail put in bids worth more than Rs 10,000 cr each",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/concerns-of-retail-response-in-mega-ipos-here-are-10-ipos-that-saw-retail-put-in-bids-worth-more-than-rs-10-000-cr-each-13495571.html,"There have been at least 10 initial public offers (IPOs) till date – with the most recent one witnessed just last month – wherein retail investors participated in huge numbers with the cumulative size of the retail applications exceeding Rs 10,000 crore. This assumes significance as a recent consultation paper by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) highlighted industry concerns related to retail response in mega-sized IPOs while proposing to reduce the retail quota in public issues. Though the proposal was rolled back – while allowing companies to list with a small quantum of dilution – data clearly shows that retail response is not always a concern even in instances when the IPO size runs into thousands of crores. Data from PRIME Database shows that the highest-ever quantum of retail bids was seen in 2008 when Reliance Power launched its IPO to raise Rs 10,123 crore. The retail portion was subscribed 13.57 times with 46.23 lakh applications with the cumulative bid amount pegged at nearly Rs 40,000 crore. While no other IPO has come close to touching that retail number again, there have been quite a few that saw the retail response in the range of Rs 10,000 crore and Rs 17,000 crore each. For instance, last year saw the IPO of Waaree Energies hitting the market to raise Rs 4,321 crore. More than 70 lakh retail applications were received with the total size of bids pegged at Rs 16,470 crore.  The year 2024 was witness to three other IPOs – Bajaj Housing Finance, KRN Heat Exchanger & Refrigeration and Unimech Aerospace & Manufacturing – wherein the cumulative worth of retail bids was in excess of Rs 10,000 crore each. Interestingly, the IPO size of KRN Heat Exchanger & Refrigeration and Unimech Aerospace & Manufacturing was Rs 342 crore and Rs 500 crore, respectively. Industry experts say that retail response is not a concern if the issue is reasonably priced and the outlook for the company and the sector is robust. “We have to acknowledge that retail investors do like to invest in IPOs and the data shows that even large issues, if attractively priced, have generated tremendous response from retail,” says Pranav Haldea, Managing Director, PRIME Database. “With SEBI allowing companies to come to the market with a smaller float, I think the concerns of the industry around the retail demand have been largely put to rest,” he adds. Most recently, NSDL saw nearly 46 lakh retail applications pour in with the total bid size pegged at nearly Rs 10,500 crore even as the overall IPO size was only Rs 4,011 crore. In the past, Tata Technologies, MOIL, Reliance Petroleum, and Coal India also saw huge response from retail investors.

Buy Allied Blenders and Distillers; target of Rs 600: ICICI Securities,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/buy-allied-blenders-and-distillers-target-of-rs-600-icici-securities-13495472.html,"ICICI Securitie's research report on Allied Blenders and Distillers Guidance for FY28: 1) mid-teens revenue growth with early double-digit volume growth; 2) an increase in the saliency of the P&A segment to 50% (vs. 40% now); 3) gross margin and EBITDA margin of 45%+ and 17%, respectively; and 4) an improvement in ROCE to 23–25% (vs. 17% in FY25). Premium & Above segment (30 mn cases segment) contributes 10% of industry volumes but accounts for 42% of net contribution (profit). Within this, the super-premium & luxury segment (12 mn cases) contributes just 3% of overall industry volume but delivers 21% of profits. Realisations in premium and super-premium to luxury are 3x and 7x higher, respectively, than those in the prestige and semi-prestige segments. Outlook We model revenue/ EBITDA/ PAT CAGRs of 12%/18%/28%, over FY25-27E. Maintain BUY with a DCF-based revised target price of INR 600 (prior: INR 580). Key risks: Significant downtrading due to tax hikes, a potential ban on spirits in states, higher than-expected inflation in key raw material prices, and changes in consumer preferences.

"Buy Coforge; target of Rs 2,240: Motilal Oswal",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/13495561-13495561.html,"Motilal Oswal's research report on Coforge We recently met with Coforge`s management to discuss the company`s outlook on growth, margins, and cash flow conversion. The team highlighted that while industry-wide demand remains mixed, budgets are opening up for vendors that can deliver outcome-driven solutions. Clients are fatigued by plain-vanilla RFPbased procurement, though they are willing to fund transformation initiatives by vendors that bring true solutioning capabilities. The healthy momentum in large deals continues, with Coforge aiming to sign at least 20 deals above USD20m in FY26 (five done so far). Outlook We believe Coforge’s strong executable order book and resilient client spending across verticals bode well for its organic business. Cross-selling opportunities in Cigniti remain highly synergistic for the company. We value Coforge at 38x FY27E EPS with a TP of INR2,240, implying a 29% potential upside. We reiterate our BUY rating on the stock.

The stock has now gained nearly 15 percent in two consecutive sessions after the firm said it has secured PLI certification for its Gen 3 scooter portfolio. The shares of the Bhavish Aggarwal-led company have now recovered nearly 41 percent from its 52-week low of Rs 39.6 per share in just over a month. In an exchange filing released on August 26, Ola Electric said, ""Ola Electric, India’s largest pure-play EV company, today announced that it has received Certification for Compliance with the eligibility assessment requirements under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for automobile and auto components sector, for its Gen 3 scooter portfolio. This certification was granted by the Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) under the aegis of the Ministry of Heavy Industries, Government of India to all of the seven Ola S1 Gen 3 scooters."" The EV-bike maker said its Gen 2 and Gen 3 scooter portfolio are now PLI-certified. Its Gen 3 portfolio, which comprises S1 Pro 3 kWh, S1 Pro 4 kWh, S1 Pro+ 4 kWh, S1 X 2 kWh, S1 X 3 kWh, S1 X 4 kWh and S1 X+ 4 kWh, comprises majority of its current sales. As a result, this certification is set to significantly enhance its profitability from Q2FY26 onwards, the company said. The PLI certification makes Ola Electric eligible for incentives ranging from 13% to 18% of the determined sales value (DSV) until 2028, it added. The shares of the company had surged nearly 5 percent on August 26 after the announcement. The stock has now extended massive gains. It is currently the top gainer on the Nifty Midcap 100 index. The stock is however down around 58 percent from its 52-week high of Rs 132.70 apiece, which it had hit in August last year. Is Ola Electric the next Zomato? Helios Mutual Fund recently added Ola Electric to its portfolio due to its potential in the EV two-wheeler space, the fund house's CEO Dinshaw Irani told The Economic Times. Speaking to the newspaper, Irani compared Ola to Eternal (Zomato), and how Helios' early bet in the food delivery giant played out. Helios had bought Zomato shares for around Rs 40 apiece. The stock is currently trading at around Rs 320 apiece. Speaking about the PLI certification, Ola Electric's spokesperson said, ""Securing PLI certification for our Gen 3 scooters, which form the bulk of our sales, is a critical step towards profitability. This will directly strengthen our cost structure and margins, enabling us to deliver sustainable growth. With our auto business targeted to turn EBITDA positive, the certification acts as a strong catalyst to achieve that goal while ensuring our customers continue to get the best-in-class EVs at highly competitive prices.""

"Auto parts maker Suprajit Engineering sees 'minimal impact' of 25 percent Trump tariffs, exploring 'full relief' from buyers",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/auto-parts-maker-suprajit-engineering-sees-minimal-impact-of-25-percent-trump-tariffs-exploring-full-relief-from-buyers-13494879.html,"Auto ancillary player Suprajit Engineering, which derives over half of its revenue from exports, sees 'minimal impact' of the additional 25 percent US tariffs, an exchange filing said on August 28, and the company will be exploring a 'full relief' from its customers. ""Most parts are not affected at all, but a small portion of exports with a possible tariff impact of about $0.5 million is estimated. This will be discussed with respective customers for full relief,"" the statement said. Suprajit Engineering said it has carried out customs consultants in US to arrive at this assessment. Shares of the company have reversed early losses, and is trading higher by over 0.5 percent, in-line with broad gains in the automotive space. Over the last one month, the shares are down 3.5 percent, and are lower by 5.6 percent on a YTD basis. The company has a market capitalisation of over Rs 6,200 crore. The company counts on leading automotive players as clients, including Bajaj Auto, TVS Motors, Hero Motocorp, Piaggio Vehicles, BMW, Volkswagen and M&M, among others.

So, we are seeking support from the customers. Now we will need to see how this and where this tariff lands and our biggest concern here is the effect on OEM and end customers, particularly how it will affect the US economy and the global economy,"" MD and Group CEO NS Mohan said during the June quarter earnings call. ""I believe that the tariff actually offers a good opportunity for us in the medium to long term than many of our competitors have."" Suprajit said the company's exposure to the US market stands at around $100-110 million, of which 70 percent is compliant with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, implying the products meet the rules of origin outlined in the agreement, to ensure it originates from North America. As of Q1FY26, there has not been any impact related to tariffs on the company, Suprajit said. ""...our conversation so far with the customer is that about 30 plus percent have agreed to accept the increased tariffs,"" founder and chairman Ajith Kumar Rai said."

This comes amid an overall downturn in the stock markets, after US President Donald Trump's 50 percent tariff on India took effect. The Nifty Smallcap 100 index dropped more than 1 percent to stand at 17,325 in the morning. It later recovered some losses and was down half a percent to hover around 17,466, as seen at 10 am. Midcap index also accompanied, dropping more than 0.6 percent to extend losses for the second consecutive session. US President Donald Trump's additional 25 percent tariff took effect yesterday (August 27), effectively taking import tax on Indian goods to as high as 50 percent. As stock markets were then closed on account of Ganesh Chaturthi, the impact of the tariffs can be seen today (August 28). India Vix, which measures volatility in the market, jumped more than 4 percent. Top smallcap losers: The shares of FirstCry-parent Brainbees Solutions were the top loser on the index, dropping nearly 3 percent to trade at Rs 365 apiece. Inox Wind, PG Electroplast, IndiaMART, Five-Star Business Finance and CreditAccess Grameen shares followed, dropping nearly 2 percent each.

But the market is unlikely to panic since the market will view this high tariffs as a short-term aberration which will be resolved soon...The real challenge before the market is the high valuations and the tepid earnings growth.

"Jefferies sees GST cut boosting autos, backs M&M, Maruti; Hero Moto tops Nifty",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/jefferies-sees-gst-cut-boosting-autos-backs-m-m-maruti-hero-moto-tops-nifty-13494641.html,"International brokerage house Jefferies expects a possible cut in the Goods and Services Tax (GST) to act as a significant trigger for the automobile sector, particularly benefiting demand for two-wheelers and small passenger vehicles. The brokerage believes that a lower tax incidence would lift affordability in price-sensitive segments, giving automakers the much-needed boost after a patchy demand environment in recent quarters. Hero MotoCorp rose over a percent to become the top gainer on the Nifty. Factoring in the potential tax cut, Jefferies has raised its FY26–28 industry volume estimates for two-wheelers and passenger vehicles by 2–6 percent. This upward revision, in turn, has led the brokerage to forecast 2–8 percent earnings upgrades for leading manufacturers such as TVS Motor, Hero MotoCorp, Maruti Suzuki, and Hyundai. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Among individual companies, Jefferies sees TVS Motor and Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) as the biggest beneficiaries of the demand tailwinds, projecting the highest EPS compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for FY25–28 at 27 percent and 19 percent, respectively. Maruti Suzuki also remains in focus as an industry bellwether, expected to gain from a volume push in small cars where affordability plays a key role. In terms of stock preferences, Jefferies named TVS Motor, M&M, and Maruti Suzuki as its top picks in the sector, underpinned by strong earnings visibility and product positioning. Hero MotoCorp, which had earlier been rated underperform, has been upgraded to hold as Jefferies sees some near-term relief from an improved demand outlook. However, Hyundai and Tata Motors remain underperformers in the brokerage’s view, with limited earnings triggers relative to peers. According to several media reports, the automobile industry has urged the Centre to implement the new GST rates by the Navratri period on September 22 instead of Diwali, fearing a potential hit to festive sales if the rollout is delayed.

The Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA) has also flagged the issue, warning that GST-related uncertainty is already disrupting near-term demand. At about 10 am, the Nifty Auto index was trading at 25,253, lower by 0.26 percent, much lower than the broader market selloff in today's session. Nifty Auto index is up 9 percent since the beginning of the year. Hero MotoCorp, Eicher Motors, Bajaj Auto, and Maruti Suzuki were the top gainers on the index. Tata Motors and M&M kept the index in the red. Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol are their own and not those of the website or its management.

"Apex Frozen, Raymond Lifestyle, other stocks drop up to 5% after Trump's 50% tariff on India takes effect",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/apex-frozen-raymond-lifestyle-other-stocks-drop-up-to-5-after-trump-s-50-tariff-on-india-takes-effect-13494594.html,"The shares of textile and shrimp companies dropped in trade on August 28 after US increased its tariffs on Indian imports to a whopping 50 percent. These export-oriented stocks extended significant losses. US President Donald Trump's additional 25 percent tariff took effect yesterday (August 27), effectively taking import tax on Indian imports to as high as 50 percent. As stock markets were then closed on account of Ganesh Chaturthi, the impact of the tariffs can be seen today (August 28). The 50 percent tariff on Indian imports is significantly higher than all Asian peers. Bangladesh and Vietnam, which compete with Indian textile exporters to the US, will pay 20 percent tariff instead. This will likely bear a strong impact on the export-oriented textile companies. KPR Mill and Raymond Lifestyle shares dropped around 3 percent in the early trading hours, while Gokaldas Exports were down nearly 1 percent. Welspun Living shares fell nearly 2 percent, while Trident shares were down over 1 percent. Shrimp feed companies also derive a major portion of their revenue from imports to the US. Notably, US was the top importer of Indian frozen shrimps in 2024-25, said Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA). “As for overseas markets, USA continued to be the major importer of Indian seafood in value terms with an import worth US$ 2,714.94 million, with volume handled 3,46,868 MT. Exports to the US increased by 6.50 per cent in US dollars, 8.76 per cent in rupee value and 5.37 per cent in volume. Within USA's seafood import basket by India, frozen shrimp continued to be the principal item with share of 92.55 per cent in terms of US dollar,” it said in a press release. Hence, the higher tariffs will likely bear a strong impact on their margins. Apex Frozen Foods shares tumbled around 5 percent in the early trading hours, while Avanti Feeds shares were down nearly 4 percent. Avanti Feeds generated 77 percent of its total revenue from the North American market in the January-March quarter. Apex Frozen generated 53 percent of its total revenue from US during the period. ""The 50% tariff imposed on India which has already come into effect  will weigh on market sentiments in the near-term. But the market is unlikely to panic since the market will view this high tariffs as a short-term aberration which will be resolved soon. The U.S. treasury secretary Scott Bessant’s comment that “ at the end of the day India and U.S. will come together” indicates the likely outcome. The market will discount this outcome without panicking…In the near-term, with the export sectors facing headwinds, smart money will be chasing fairly valued domestic consumption themes. Investors can consider moving money from over-valued smallcaps to the safety of fairly valued largecaps with focus on domestic consumption,"" said VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments.

IT and bank stocks were the biggest drags, while the mid and smallcap stocks mirrored weak trends to slip 1 percent each. At about 9:30 am, the Sensex was down 607.99 points or 0.75 percent at 80,178.55, and the Nifty was down 179.65 points or 0.73 percent at 24,532.40.

Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates ""The 50 percent tariff imposed on India, which has already come into effect, will weigh on market sentiments in the near term. But the market is unlikely to panic since the market will view these high tariffs as a short-term aberration which will be resolved soon,"" says V K Vijayakumar of Geojit Investments Ltd. ""The real challenge before the market is the high valuations and the tepid earnings growth. The strong pillar of support to the market is the aggressive buying by DIIs flush with funds. Any selling by FIIs will be easily neutralised by the aggressive buying by DIIs,"" he added. Among individual stocks, InterGlobe Aviation, the parent of budget airline IndiGo, slipped over 4 percent as the Rakesh Gangwal family likely pared its stake via the block deal route. The Rakesh Gangwal family, CNBC TV-18 Awaaz reported that the Gangwal family was planning to sell up to 3.1 percent stake in InterGlobe Aviation through block deals worth Rs 7,084 crore. Polycab slipped over a percent even as Jefferies reiterated its buy call with a target price of Rs 8,180 per share, citing the company’s consistent double-digit sales growth in the cables and wires segment over the past 12 quarters. Market share gains, rising power capex, margin turnaround in FMEG, and strong order books in RDSS and Bharat Net are seen as key growth drivers. Jefferies estimates an over 26 percent EPS CAGR between FY25–28. Technical View The index has filled the gap created in the August 18 session and is now trading slightly above the 100-SMA while still holding well above the 200-SMA. However, it remains below all short-term moving averages, including the 9-EMA, 20-EMA, and 50-SMA, reflecting that near-term momentum is under strain. Looking ahead, support is placed at 24,600 (100-SMA) followed by 24,500, while resistance remains near 24,900–25,000, where short-term moving averages converge. Unless Nifty reclaims these upper levels, the outlook may remain tilted to the downside. “On the daily chart, the Nifty Bank index has broken below the midline of the Donchian Channel and is now testing the lower band of the channel. The breakdown has brought the index close to its recent swing low of 54,905, which failed to hold as support. A further slip could expose the index to 54,000 or deeper, Dhupesh Dhameja of SAMCO Securities said. Hero MotoCorp, Asian Paints, HUL, Maruti Suzuki, and Titan Company were the top gainers on the Nifty. Laggards on the index included Shriram Finance, HCL Tech, HDFC Bank, Jio Financial Services, TCS, and NTPC.

A total of 2,171 shares saw selling pressure compared to 599 rising shares on the NSE. Overall, the bearish sentiment may prevail, and any bounce back may face selling pressure. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Amol Athawale, VP Technical Research at Kotak Securities Dabur India | CMP: Rs 522.4  After sharp uptrend rally, Dabur witnessed bit of a selling pressure but eventually its downward momentum paused, and it has found support. However, on weekly charts the stock has formed cup and handle kind of formation and fresh breakout from the resistance zone is very likely to occur in the coming trading sessions. As long as the stock is trading above Rs 505, the bullish texture is likely to continue. Above which, the stock could move up to Rs 560. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 560 Stop-Loss: Rs 505 Hyundai Motor India | CMP: Rs 2,492.4  Post decline from the higher levels, Hyundai Motor India rebounded from its retracement zone and witnessed a steady recovery from the lower levels. Additionally, on the daily charts, the stock has given a breakout from its sloping trendline. The up moves in the counter suggest a new leg of bullish trend from the current levels. For the next few trading sessions, Rs 2,410 could be the trend decider level for the bulls, if it sustains above the same, we can expect further uptrend towards Rs 2,670. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,670 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,410 Tata Consumer Products | CMP: Rs 1,079.9  On the weekly charts, post decline from the higher levels, Tata Consumer Products rebounded from its short moving average support zone and witnessed a steady recovery from the lower levels. Additionally, the counter has given a breakout from its sloping channel formation. For positional traders, Rs 1,040 would be the decisive level. Trading above the same uptrend formation will continue till Rs 1,155. However, if it closes below Rs 1,040 traders may prefer to exit from trading long positions. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,155 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,040 Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors Waaree Energies | CMP: Rs 3,265.3  In the previous session, post minor dip, Waaree Energies resumes its up move and managed to surge by more than 3% despite broader indices falling which is a strong bullish sign. On the daily chart, prices on August 14 found support of its upwards sloping trendline and has seen a rise of more than 17% since which highlights that bulls are increasing their take by each passing day. As of now, prices are trading near its important resistance area of Rs 3,330 levels and now a break above it can further boost bullish momentum in the stock. Also, MACD has recently given a bullish crossover which acts like a double confirmation for our stance. Hence, the current trend for Waaree Energies looks to be on the positive side. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,475, Rs 3,600 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,185 PVR Inox | CMP: Rs 1,139  PVR Inox continued to see higher high and higher low formation since start of August 2025. In the previous session, prices found support of the conversion line (blue) of the Ichimoku cloud and we saw a bounce on the upside of nearly 4% from day’s low of Rs 1,100 levels. At the end, stock managed to close above prior day’s high which is a positive sign. On the daily chart, stock is on the verge to give breakout of the bigger Rounding bottom pattern on the daily chart. Volumes have started top pick up and ADX is showing readings above 25 at 36 levels suggesting that good momentum is expected to continue. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,200, Rs 1,250 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,100 Britannia Industries | CMP: Rs 5,765.5  In the previous session, FMCG sector managed to outshine while other sectors closed in red which is a strong bullish sign. Britannia Industries was the top performer in the sector and surged nearly 4%. Moreover, prices after 3 days of losing streak managed to close above its prior day’s high which highlights that bulls are getting active in the stock. Moreover, recently prices found support of its mid-Bollinger bands and bounced on the upside from it with which highlights buying pressure from lower levels. For now, follow up price action is must for this bullish move to continue in the stock. Also, KST (Know Sure thing) indicator which helps to understand overall momentum in the stock. KST has just turned above signal line and now a break above the zero line can further boost bullish momentum in the stock. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 5,980, Rs 6,140 Stop-Loss: Rs 5,620 Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities SJVN | CMP: Rs 99.23  After witnessing a sharp upmove in the last week, SJVN has shifted into a consolidation phase so far this week. The stock price has moved above the crucial resistance of down sloping trendline at Rs 99 in last week and is trading slightly higher. Hence, there is a higher possibility of further extension of upside momentum in the coming week. Volume has started to expand during upside breakout in the stock price and weekly 14 period RSI shows positive indication. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 109 Stop-Loss: Rs 94 RattanIndia Enterprises | CMP: Rs 58.2  The downward correction of the last 4-5 weeks seems to have completed, and the stock price of RattanIndia Enterprises formed an important reversal on the upside on Tuesday.

"Rakesh Gangwal family set to offload 3.1 percent stake in IndiGo via block deals worth Rs 7,020 crore",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/rakesh-gangwal-family-set-to-offload-3-1-percent-stake-in-indigo-via-block-deals-worth-rs-7-020-crore-13492181.html,"The Rakesh Gangwal family is set to offload as much as 3.1 percent of their stake in InterGlobe Aviation through block deals worth approximately Rs 7,020 crore, CNBC Awaaz reported citing sources familiar with the development. The floor price of the block is pegged at Rs 5,808 per share, which will be a 4% discount to last traded price, and is likely to be executed on August 28. The transaction reflects a continued and gradual exit by the Gangwal family from IndiGo, after Rakesh Gangwal stepped down from the airline's board in February 2022. In 2025 alone, the Gangwal family has offloaded as much as 9 percent stake. As recently as May, a block deal was executed in IndiGo shares worth around Rs 11,900 crore. Shares of Interglobe Aviation are higher by 31 percent so far this year, and over the last five years, they are higher by 400 percent. As recently as last week, IndiGo was announced to be included in the benchmark Nifty 50 index, as a part of the semi-annual index reshuffle. For the June quarter, the low-cost airline posted a profit of Rs 2,161 crore, down 21 percent as compared to a year ago. Revenue from operations for IndiGo rose 5 percent to Rs 20,496 crore from a year-ago period. In a recent note, Kotak Securities has noted IndiGo’s capacity cuts were likely occurring at a slightly faster pace than its key competitor, however, the brokerage clarified that it was not a sign of weakening demand. Unlike its earlier approach of adding capacity in Q2 ahead of strong Q3 and Q4 demand, IndiGo is now focusing on measures to support yield growth during the festive season, Kotak note said."
"Chartist Talk: Bet on these 2 stocks with worst over for HUL, Maruti Suzuki looks overbought after 18% rally, says Centrum’s Nilesh Jain",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/chartist-talk-bet-on-these-2-stocks-with-worst-over-for-hul-maruti-suzuki-looks-overbought-after-18-rally-says-centrum-s-nilesh-jain-13491903.html,"According to Nilesh Jain, the Head - Equity Technical & Derivative Research at Centrum Broking, considering the stock has already rallied nearly 18 percent this month and the RSI is in overbought territory, the risk–reward does not appear favourable for fresh entries at current levels in Maruti Suzuki. The recent price momentum in HUL indicates that the worst may be behind, he said in an interview to Moneycontrol, adding the stock looks poised to scale new record highs beyond Rs 3,000 in the near term. He bets on Olectra Greentech, FSN E-Commerce Ventures Nykaa. ""Olectra is trading comfortably above all key moving averages, and has also witnessed a golden crossover, while Nykaa, on the weekly charts, has formed a strong base along with a Cup & Handle pattern, which is typically considered a trend reversal formation. Do you think the worst is over, though the charts are looking weak, or do you see the Nifty bears closing bullish gap? The Nifty index opened last week with a sharp gap-up and completed its 61.8% retracement of the decline from 25,669 to 24,338 at 25,160. However, the index soon faced sharp profit-taking, slipping below its 50-DMA at 25,010, which now acts as immediate resistance. The bullish gap has almost been filled, suggesting the possibility of near-term consolidation. On the downside, the 100-DMA at 24,660 remains a crucial support. A decisive break below this level could trigger a retest of the August low at 24,340. Unless this support zone is breached, the index is likely to oscillate in the broader range of 24,400–25,000. From a positioning standpoint, the FII long-short ratio has fallen to an extreme low of 10:90, highlighting aggressive bearish positioning, whereas DIIs have continued to remain net buyers through the August series. Overall, the technical setup appears weak, but with the monthly August expiry approaching, any positive trigger could spark a strong short-covering rally in the index. Do you see the strong possibility of more correction in Bank Nifty, or will it rebound from here on, though it saw a new August low? The Bank Nifty remains the key drag on the broader markets, weighing heavily on overall sentiment. The index is currently trading well below all its short-term moving averages and has witnessed a structural breakdown. It has already attempted to fill the gap created on May 12 near the 54,000 mark, and a complete fill looks increasingly likely. For any meaningful recovery, it is crucial for the index to reclaim the 21-DMA and 100-DMA, both placed around the 55,500 level. Until then, the technical setup remains weak. On the downside, immediate support is seen at 53,500, while the 200-DMA at 52,900 will act as a critical level to watch. Momentum indicators and oscillators on the weekly chart have triggered a sell crossover, reinforcing a sell-on-rise bias in the short term for the Bank Nifty. Do you see the uptrend continuing in Britannia Industries and Eicher Motors? The consumption space is back in focus, with defensives once again attracting attention amid prevailing market uncertainty. Britannia has been steadily inching higher, crossing above all its key short-term and long-term moving averages. A bullish crossover on the MACD, along with the RSI moving above 55, indicates strength and supports the likelihood of a continued uptrend. The stock has potential to move towards Rs 6,200, while immediate support is placed at Rs 5,530. Eicher Motors remains in a secular uptrend, now trading in uncharted territory. The recent breakout, supported by higher-than-average volumes, suggests strong momentum is intact. In the near term, the stock is poised to move towards Rs 6,500, while immediate support is placed at Rs 5,850. What are your top 2 bets? Olectra Greentech The stock is forming a large rounding bottom pattern and is gradually moving higher. It is trading comfortably above all key short-term and long-term moving averages, and has also witnessed a golden crossover, with the 50-DMA crossing above the 200-DMA, signalling strong momentum in the near term. Based on this setup, the stock is expected to move towards Rs 1,770, while a stop loss can be placed near its 21-DMA support at Rs 1,465. FSN E-Commerce Ventures Nykaa On the weekly charts, the stock has formed a strong base along with a Cup & Handle pattern, which is typically considered a trend reversal formation. A decisive breakout above Rs 232 would provide bullish confirmation, opening the way for an upside target near Rs 280 as per the pattern projection. Momentum indicators and oscillators are firmly in buy mode on both the daily and weekly timeframes, further supporting the positive outlook. On the downside, the 100-DMA at Rs 203 serves as a crucial support. Hence, the stock can be considered for addition post a breakout above Rs 232, with an upside potential towards Rs 280 and a stop-loss placed at Rs 203. Are you super bullish on Maruti and HUL, considering the charts? Maruti Suzuki has given a breakout from a triangle pattern near Rs 13,400, supported by a breakaway gap. The conservative target of this breakout is placed around Rs 15,500, while the aggressive target stands at Rs 16,500. However, considering the stock has already rallied nearly 18% this month and the RSI is in overbought territory, the risk–reward does not appear favourable for fresh entries at current levels. Instead, the stock can be accumulated in a staggered manner as a positional buy, with key support placed at Rs 13,400. Hindustan Unilever (HUL) has emerged from a four-year consolidation phase, and the recent price momentum indicates that the worst may be behind. The stock looks poised to scale new record highs beyond Rs 3,000 in the near term, with immediate support at Rs 2,520. What is the likelihood of the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices breaking their August lows? The broader markets have witnessed deeper cuts compared to the benchmark indices in the August series. Both the Nifty Midcap and Nifty Smallcap indices are currently trading below their respective short-term moving averages, signaling a weak near-term structure. The Nifty Smallcap index appears precariously positioned, hovering close to a breakdown from its long-term 200-DMA at 17,500. A breach below this level would further dent sentiment and intensify selling pressure. Meanwhile, the Nifty Midcap index continues to face stiff resistance near its 50-DMA at 58,000, where persistent supply has been observed. Although the index earlier managed to defend its 100-DMA, the same level is now being retested, highlighting vulnerability. Overall, the broader structure of both indices remains weak, with a high probability of breaking their August lows in the immediate term.

Asian shares post modest drop with focus on Nvidia,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/asian-shares-post-modest-drop-with-focus-on-nvidia-13491919.html,"Asian equities struggled for direction at the open Wednesday as investors awaited Nvidia Corp.’s earnings for guidance on where the markets head next after a strong rally since April. Shares edged up in Australia while gauges in Japan and South Korea were flat. Chips and the electronics sector were in focus with Nikon Corp. shares jumping 20% in Japan while Chinese artificial intelligence linchpin Cambricon Technologies Corp. swung to a record profit. US shares gained Tuesday, led by Nvidia before the tech giant’s hotly-anticipated earnings that are scheduled to report after the bell on Wednesday. A gauge of the dollar and longer-dated Treasuries steadied in Asia after they declined Tuesday following President Donald Trump’s push to oust Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. The gap between five and 30-year yields is at its steepest since 2021. While political meddling in monetary policy after Trump’s move drew much of the market’s focus, traders face key risks this week with Nvidia’s earnings and Friday’s inflation report. Even with tariff and geopolitical headlines flaring, investors remain anchored to a bullish market script: a likely September rate cut, resilient economic growth, and corporate earnings strong enough to keep equity sentiment afloat. “Equity markets will be looking squarely at Nvidia’s upcoming earnings report for cues as to whether the current bull run continues or stalls out,” wrote Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at KCM Trade. Nvidia’s earnings report is expected to give an update on the artificial intelligence spending boom — and how the US-China rivalry is limiting growth. Analysts estimate that the biggest buyers of AI hardware are still investing heavily in new gear, with the company’s sales set to grow at a pace of more than 50% this year. Dimming the excitement is confusion over how much business Nvidia will be able to do in China. “Nvidia’s results transcend the company, becoming a barometer of macroeconomic activity, a talisman for the artificial intelligence trade, and a critical pressure point for global geopolitics,” wrote Kyle Rodda, a senior market analyst at Capital.com in Melbourne. Meanwhile, Trump said he was prepared for a legal fight while the Fed, weighing in for the first time this week, said it would abide by any court decision in Cook’s legal challenge of her dismissal. The Fed’s perceived independence from government whims is a bedrock assumption of US markets, and any change to that perception could weigh on US credit ratings. “Trump’s push to fire Cook has exacerbated concerns about the Fed’s independence,” said Ian Lyngen at BMO Capital Markets. “While the price action in US rates has been largely contained to the recent range, many of the go-to hedges against an erosion of Fed independence outperformed on the news of Cook’s firing.” Separately, economic data Tuesday showed US orders for business equipment increased in July by more than projected, suggesting companies are moving forward on investment plans as uncertainty around trade and tax policy gradually diminishes. Also, consumer confidence fell slightly in August as Americans worried more about their prospects of finding a job. On the trade front, the US will slap a crushing 50% tariff on some Indian goods starting Wednesday — the highest in Asia — as Trump presses ahead with the levies to punish New Delhi for buying Russian oil."

Trading in derivatives, equities, SLBs, currency derivatives, and interest rate derivatives will remain shut for the day. The commodity derivatives segment will also remain closed in the morning session between 9:00 am to 5:00 pm, while it will remain open for the evening session between 5:00 pm to 11:55 pm. Trading on the NSE and the BSE will resume on August 28 (Thursday). On August 26, Indian equity indices ended on a weak note with Nifty around 24,700. At close, the Sensex was down 849.37 points or 1.04 percent at 80,786.54, and the Nifty was down 255.70 points or 1.02 percent at 24,712.05. Biggest Nifty losers were Shriram Finance, Sun Pharma, Tata Steel, Bajaj Finance, Trent, while gainers included Eicher Motors, HUL, Maruti Suzuki, Nestle India, ITC. Except FMCG, all other sectoral indices ended in the red with PSU Bank, metal, pharma, oil & gas, consumer durables, realty, telecom down 1-2% The BSE midcap index shed 1.3 percent and smallcap index fell 1.7 percent.

Among sectors, Capital Market, Defense, and Real Estate shed over 2 percent, whereas despite weak market sentiment, the FMCG index outperformed and rallied nearly 1 percent,"" said Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities. ""Technically, after a gap-down open, the market breached the crucial support zone of 24,850/81300, and post-breakdown, selling pressure intensified. Additionally, it also formed a long bearish candle on the daily charts and is holding a lower top formation on intraday charts, which is largely negative."" ""We believe that the intraday market texture is weak, but a fresh selloff is possible only after the dismissal of the 24650/80500. Below this level, the index could retest the level of 24,550-24500/80200-80000. On the flip side, above 20 day SMA or 24750/81000, a pullback move is likely to continue up to 24850-24900/81300-81500,"" Chouhan added. Indian rupee ended 10 paise lower at 87.68 per dollar on Tuesday versus Monday’s close of 87.58. ""The bias for the rupee still weak amid imbalance between dollar demand and supply. The local rupee got support from MSCI rebalance inflows in today’s session. Looking at the current market conditions, the rupee’s new low is looking imminent, while a move to 86.50 appears distant,"" said Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities. ""The short term traders will be eyeing on the trade tariff and GST rate rejig announcement. The spot USDINR has near term support at 87.25 and resistance at 87.90, he added.

The case pertained to alleged lapses in due diligence and compliance requirements under the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Registrars to an Issue and Share Transfer Agents) Regulations, 1993. The market regulator had conducted an inspection of KFin Technologies between February 19-23, 2024, for the period from February 1 to November 30, 2023. The inspection report alleged that the company failed to exercise due diligence while processing requests for dematerialisation of shares and did not mark over 17.9 lakh folios without PAN details and 17.7 lakh folios without bank account details for enhanced due diligence as required under Sebi’s circulars and master circular. Also read: Sebi panel recommends open offer process may be faster with quicker payout to investors Following the issuance of a show-cause notice in July 2024, KFin Tech filed a settlement application in August 2024, seeking to resolve the matter without prolonged litigation. The internal committee of Sebi initially recommended an indicative amount of Rs 87.75 lakh under the settlement framework, which was later agreed upon by the company. “The High-Powered Advisory Committee, in its meeting held on June 5, 2025, recommended that the case may be settled upon payment of Rs 87,75,000 (Rupees eighty-seven lakh seventy-five thousand only) as the settlement amount,” the order stated. The recommendations were approved by Sebi’s panel of Whole Time Members on August 8, 2025, and the company confirmed payment on August 25, 2025. Consequently, the adjudication proceedings were disposed of by Sebi. Under the settlement proceedings parties settle case with Sebi, without admitting or denying the guilt. However, Sebi retains the right to reopen the case if representations made during the settlement process are found to be incorrect.

The Nifty ends 256 points lower, while the Sensex was down by 849 points. Among sectors, Capital Market, Defense, and Real Estate shed over 2 percent, whereas despite weak market sentiment, the FMCG index outperformed and rallied nearly 1 percent. Technically, after a gap-down open, the market breached the crucial support zone of 24,850/81300, and post-breakdown, selling pressure intensified. Additionally, it also formed a long bearish candle on the daily charts and is holding a lower top formation on intraday charts, which is largely negative. We believe that the intraday market texture is weak, but a fresh selloff is possible only after the dismissal of the 24650/80500. Below this level, the index could retest the level of 24,550-24500/80200-80000. On the flip side, above 20 day SMA or 24750/81000, a pullback move is likely to continue up to 24850-24900/81300-81500. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The Nifty fell sharply, breaking below the support level of 24,800. Today’s decline was severe, pushing the index under the critical 50-day EMA. The RSI has entered a bearish crossover, indicating weakening price momentum. In the short term, the index is likely to remain under selling pressure as long as it trades below 24,850. On the downside, the correction could extend towards 24,150 or lower.

Derivatives traders unwind positions ahead of holiday-shortened expiry week,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/derivatives-traders-unwind-positions-ahead-of-holiday-shortened-expiry-week-13488692.html,"Derivative equity markets saw cautious action on August 26 as traders trimmed positions ahead of Wednesday’s market holiday and the monthly expiry slated for Thursday, with impending Trump tariffs weighing on investors. US President Trump’s additional 25 percent tariffs on India are set to come into effect from August 27, keeping the sentiment weak as stocks tumbled sharply in late session on Tuesday. More Bets Against Upside The sentiment has likely shifted in the options setup, said Ajit Mishra, SVP at Religare Broking, adding that until Monday, put writers were active with 24,800 strike acting as a key support, implying a bet on stable markets. However, Tuesday’s market fall has been followed by call writers - those betting against further upside - turning aggressive at the same strike price of 24,800, effectively capping any meaningful upside. Why This Matters The open interest at 24,800 has now risen to nearly 1.4 crore contracts from 1.2 crore earlier. Below this, the 24,600 level is likely to act as a strong base, coinciding with the gap created on August 18 after PM Modi’s announcement of GST reforms, Mishra added. In simpler terms, traders who were earlier betting on 24,800 holding up as a ‘floor’ for the Nifty have now turned cautious, and fresh bets are building up on the downside. Sahaj Agarwal, Head of Derivatives Research at Kotak Securities said that while some downside is possible from current levels, the broader trend still indicates markets may remain sideways. “The weekly setup was corrective and the new developments on the tariff front have pushed the market downwards. Upside remains limited for sure, while on the downside a sustained move below 24,750 could invite further selling pressure,” he said. Premium Decay Rajesh Palviya, Senior Vice President – Technical and Derivatives Research at Axis Securities agreed with this narrow-band assessment. With Wednesday being a trading holiday, option writers could enjoy a one-day premium decay advantage. A premium decay advantage refers to the benefit that option sellers gain from the fall in an option's premium as it nears expiry. Driven by the erosion of time value, this decay allows sellers to profit from the natural loss of value in an option. “Unless there is a big move on expiry day, (option) writers will stay in control. Based on the current setup, expiry is likely to remain within the 24,800-25,000 band. Only a decisive move beyond this range could hurt writers, but till then, they remain in the comfort zone,” Rajesh Palviya said. Dhupesh Dhameja of SAMCO Securities said call writers have taken control, particularly at the 25,000 strike, where open interest has jumped to 1.57 crore contracts. This heavy writing signals that traders see 25,000 as a strong resistance zone and are betting against the index breaking past it in the near term. On the flip side, the 24,900 strike has emerged as a key support with nearly 96.82 lakh put contracts - the second-highest open interest on the put side. He added that the Put-Call Ratio (PCR) has improved from 0.61 to 0.77, indicating a gradual shift of put writers to slightly higher strikes. But call writers continue to dominate, keeping the upside in check. Kotak’s Sahaj Agarwal said the volatility could stay high, there is no structural weakness showing up in market data. What makes the positioning more relevant this week is the calendar. With a trading holiday on Wednesday and expiry on Thursday, market participants appear unwilling to carry aggressive bets. As a result, positions are being unwound or adjusted, and the 24,800-25,000 range has become the focus of action. The compressed window leaves little room for risk-taking, making expiry week volatile but range bound. Bank Nifty Meanwhile, Laxmikant Shukla, Sr. Technical Analyst of equities at YES Securities highlights that bank nifty remains a laggard. ""It has underperformed the benchmark index with sustenance below the recent low, and calls writing has shifted its range even lower. Therefore, the undertone is likely to remain negative as long as banknifty remains beneath 55k,"" he said. Sahaj Agarwal has pegged the support for Bank Nifty at 54,000, and sees the index relatively weaker compared to the broader market. SAMCO’s Dhupesh Dhameja said traders are turning defensive, with heavy call writing at the 55,500 strike and open interest rising to 22.49 lakh contracts, traders are viewing this level as a strong resistance. At the same time, the 55,000 strike holds the highest put open interest at 14.37 lakh contracts, making it an important support. However, put writers unwinding positions and shifting to lower strikes alongside call writers increasing bets at higher levels shows traders are less confidence of a sharp rally. The open interest in Bank Nifty has fallen by 5.02 percent while the price has dipped slightly by 0.06 percent. Falling OI, with a marginal price decline suggests long unwinding, as traders are closing out existing long positions fearing less chance of further gains.

The drop comes after a draft notice revealed US President Donald Trump’s plan to slap 50 percent tariffs on Indian goods. Markets will remain shut on August 27 on account of Ganesh Chaturthi. At close, the Sensex was down 849.37 points or 1.04 percent at 80,786.54, and the Nifty was down 255.70 points or 1.02 percent at 24,712.05.

Among gainers, FMCG stood out with gains of over 1 percent, while Auto succumbed to selling pressure and ended in the red. Volatility edged higher, with India VIX rising more than 3 percent. Among individual stocks, India's leading auto major, Maruti Suzuki, closed 2 percent higher after Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the first of the two major projects at the Suzuki Motor Plant in Hansalpur, Gujarat. This includes the flag off of the first unit of the Maruti Suzuki e-Vitara to be rolled off the production line. It will be followed by the inauguration of the first plant to produce hybrid battery electrodes. The shares of pharma companies dropped in trade on August 26 after US President Donald Trump said that he would reduce drug prices in the US by a whopping ""1,400-1,500 percent"". He also reiterated his threat to slap higher tariffs on pharma imports. The index has now snapped a three-session gaining streak. Trump had earlier sent letters to major drug makers, demanding they lower drug prices in the US and bring them in line with what other nations are paying for new medicines. Shares of Vodafone Idea Ltd., declined as much as 9 percent on August 26, after having gained as much as 20 percent in the last six trading sessions, of which they gained in five. The fall came after Minister of State for Communications Chandra S Pemmasani ruled out any further relief to the debt-laden telecom operator.

Technical View Unless the index decisively clears 25,150, upward momentum is likely to remain capped. On the downside, sustaining above 24,800 is critical to prevent deeper corrections. For now, a “sell on rise” approach appears prudent, with traders awaiting a clear breakout above 25,100 or a breakdown below 24,800 for the next directional move. Ahead of the key tariff announcement on the 27th, the market is likely to witness sideways-to-volatile sessions. ""On the daily chart, the Nifty Bank index remains below all key moving averages except the 200-day moving average, highlighting that recovery attempts are being capped at higher levels. The index continues to hover close to the recent swing low of 54,905, which is acting as immediate support. A breakdown below this zone could drag the index further toward 54,600, which coincides with the 127.8 percent Fibonacci extension,"" Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities said. ""The broader trend remains fragile as long as the index stays below its short-term averages. Support is placed at 54,900, followed by 54,600, while resistance stays firm at 55,500–55,600. Until the index crosses above these hurdles, short-term moves may remain choppy with risks tilted toward the downside,"" he added. Eicher Motors, HUL, Maruti Suzuki, ITC, Nestle India, and TCS were the top gainers on the Nifty. Laggards on the index included Shriram Finance, Sun Pharma, Tata Steel, Bajaj Finance, and Trent.

"Raymond Lifestyle, KPR Mills, Avanti Feeds, other textile and shrimp stocks decline up to 5% on US tariff worries",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/raymond-lifestyle-kpr-mills-avanti-feeds-other-textile-and-shrimp-stocks-decline-up-to-5-on-us-tariff-worries-13489660.html,"Textile and shrimp stocks fell up to 5 percent on Tuesday after the United States issued a draft order to impose an additional 25 percent tariff on Indian imports, effective August 27. According to a notice from the US Department of Homeland Security, the tariffs will apply to Indian products “that are entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 am Eastern Daylight Time on August 27, 2025”. The move triggered concerns in the textile and shrimp sectors, with exporters fearing order cancellations and potential losses. Shrimp exporters, who send more than half their output to the US, expressed worry over the sharp increase in duty. There are fears that the textile and apparel orders could shift to rival exporters such as Bangladesh, China and Vietnam, which face lower tariffs. Sunny Agrawal, Head - Fundamental Research at SBI Securities, noted that the imposition of a 50% US tariff, effective from August 27, 2025, has raised concerns for Indian exporters, particularly in sectors like textiles and shrimp. Companies such as Gokaldas and Avanti Feeds have substantial exposure to the US market, and the steep tariff is expected to impact their sales volumes and margins. ""Going forward, these companies may trade with negative bias, depending on the duration and scope of the imposed tariffs. Export-dependent companies will need to reassess their pricing strategies and explore alternative markets to mitigate risks. Stocks have also already corrected materially post first announcement of likely 25% incremental tariff in the first week of August and to that extent most of the negatives are already priced in,"" he added. On the National Stock Exchange, Raymond Lifestyle declined nearly 3 percent to Rs 1,145 per share, while KPR Mill fell 4.6 percent to Rs 973.6. Trident and Gokaldas Exports slipped up to 3 percent each, and Garware Technical Fibres and Welspun Living were down up to 2 percent. Shrimp stocks also saw selling pressure. Avanti Feeds dropped 0.4 percent, while Apex Frozen Foods and Waterbase Ltd slipped up to 1 percent. Trade between the US and India is valued at over $190 billion. The higher duties come as part of Washington’s response to India’s continued oil trade with Russia, and mark one of the steepest tariff actions against a trading partner.

HDFC Bank shares adjust to bonus issue: Did the stock actually plunge 50% in one day?,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/hdfc-bank-shares-adjust-to-bonus-issue-did-the-stock-actually-plunge-50-in-one-day-13490156.html,"The shares of HDFC Bank closed at around Rs 972 apiece on August 26, which is around 50 percent lower than the previous closing price of Rs 1,964 apiece. This comes as the shares of India's largest private lender adjusted to a 1:1 bonus issue. HDFC Bank on July 19 had announced its first ever bonus issue of shares in the ratio of 1:1. The Mumbai-based private lender set August 27 (tomorrow) as the record date to determine the eligibility of the shareholders set to receive the bonus shares. Eligible shareholders will receive one bonus share for every single share of the company they own, as on record date. As stock markets will remain closed tomorrow on account of Ganesh Chaturthi, the stock adjustment may have taken effect today. While the issue of bonus shares increases the total number of shares issued and owned, it does not change the market capitalization of the company. This increases the overall liquidity of the stock. That is why, the price of HDFC Bank shares appears to have halved after the adjustment. Bonus issue essentially are free shares offered by a company from its reserves. Such issue is perceived to reflect on a firm's strong financials and growth potential. In actual terms, HDFC Bank shares dropped nearly 1 percent on August 26. The stock currently has a P/E ratio of over 41. Along with the bonus issue, the private lender had also announced a special interim dividend of Rs 5 per share, in its results for the first quarter of financial year 2026. HDFC Bank, on July 19, reported a decline in consolidated net profit to Rs 16,258 crore in Q1 FY26, down from Rs 16,475 crore a year ago, despite a one-time pre-tax gain of Rs 9,128 crore from the IPO of its subsidiary, HDB Financial Services. The bank's standalone net interest income (NII) expanded 5.4 percent to Rs 31,438 crore in Q1 FY26.
