"Tata Consumer targets premiumization of tea portfolio to take on HUL, shares higher by 3 percent",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/tata-consumer-targets-premiumization-of-tea-portfolio-to-take-on-hul-shares-higher-by-3-percent-13552895.html,"FMCG major Tata Consumer Products (TCPL) has plans to pursue premiumization of its tea portfolio to drive growth and unlock value for shareholders, spurring the shares higher by nearly 3 percent in early trade on September 17, with volumes higher than the one-month average of 10 lakh shares. The President of packaged beverages business for India and South Asia, Puneet Das confirmed the plans to seek premiumization of its portfolio to drive growth. TCPL offers packaged beverage products, including tea under different premium and economy brands, in both general trade and e-commerce routes with the offline mode contributing to 80 percent of sales. In the e-commerce channel, Tata Tea has sustained market leadership for three years, outpacing competitors, the company has said. A news report by Informist Media quoted Puneet Das telling reporters in Kolkata that the company will aim to reclaim volume leadership in the segment, which was ceded to Hindustan Unilever in 2017-18. Das added that the difference between TCPL and HUL's sales is less than a percent in terms of volume, and around 4-5 percent in value terms. Tatas are targetting a 6-8 percent total value growth in the tea segment for the fiscal, according to the June quarter earnings call. TCPL recently launched premium offerings in the tea category, including a green tea with L-Carnitine, an amino acid that helps burn fat, as well as brought in Sachin Tendulkar to endorse Organic India, a brand that the Tatas acquired in 2024. Aside of new launches and deeper distribution network, Tata Global said it aims to expand into towns with populations between 50,000 and 100,000 to increase market reach. Going forward, the management believes if the tea prices fall it may result in lower cost for consumers, but TCPL said it is confident of holding on to profit margins of 30 percent range by Q3FY26. ""If the tea prices come off rapidly, the locals will have access to lower tea prices. And therefore, as we see market prices moving, we will -- like I said, 34% to 36%, 37%, is a margin which we are comfortable with. I don't think this category, you can go beyond this and therefore, as -- if prices come down more dramatically, we will have to give up something in terms of consumer price as well. But overall, I would say, by Q3, you should see margins operating in this range. On a YTD basis, Tata Consumer shares are higher by 22 percent, and down 8 percent over last one year."

Sensex gained more than 300 points (around 0.4 percent) to trade near  the 82,700-mark. Nifty 50, meanwhile, rose more than 90 points (0.37 percent) to hover near 25,333, as seen at 12 pm. PSU Bank stocks led gains, with IT, realty, auto and media stocks were also among the top gainers. FMCG, metal and pharma stocks, however, were trading in the red. Here are the possible key factors pushing the markets into the green: Cooling India-US trade tensions: Indo-US relations have seen some improvement in recent days with US President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreeing to resume trade talks. Brendan Lynch, a key US trade negotiator arrived in India yesterday to discuss 'trade issues' between Washington and New Delhi. Trump called Prime Minister Modi a ""dear friend"" and talked optimistically about the trade momentum. PM Modi, in turn, reaffirmed India and US as ""close friends and natural partners"" and expressed confidence that current trade talks would unlock significant potential for both nations. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said he had a ""wonderful call"" with PM Modi. ""I wished him a very Happy Birthday! He is doing a tremendous job. Narendra: Thank you for your support on ending the War between Russia and Ukraine! President DJT,"" he wrote. The Indian Prime Minister then thanked him for his birthday wishes. The cooling trade tensions between India and US provided much needed boost to the stock markets, as investors earlier remained worried over the impact of Trump's 50 percent tariff on India. Motilal Oswal Financial Services said the markets are likely to be supported by encouraging developments in the ongoing US-India trade negotiations. ""A recent phone conversation between the US President and Indian Prime Minister on Modi’s birthday signals a willingness to ease tensions between the two major economies, further boosting investor sentiment,"" the domestic brokerage said. Likelihood of Fed rate cut: The US Federal Reserve is holding its FOMC meeting from September 16 to September 17. The American central bank's chief Jerome Powell is set to announce the outcome of the meet later today. Analysts estimate that the Fed will cut rates this time — especially amid weak jobs data and rising pressure from President Donald Trump's administration. Rate cut decision by the US Federal Reserve impact the Indian stock market, as it weighs or boosts several rate sensitive stocks. For example, a rate cut in the US is expected to increase the discretionary spending limit, which in turn benefits IT companies which derive a significant portion of their revenue from the North American market. Also, investors expect a rate cut in the US to pave the way for a rate cut in India. The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is set to meet between September 29 and October 1. Any rate cut announcement by the RBI directly impacts the market. Weak US dollar: Rupee recorded its best start in three weeks, opening below the 88-mark on September 17. The currency opened at 87.82 against the dollar after closing the previous session at 88.05. This comes as dollar index remained week as investors awaited Fed’s FOMC meet outcome. ""Expectations of a 25 basis point rate cut by the US Federal Reserve in today's FOMC meeting, coupled with the US Dollar Index dropping to a 3.5-year low below the 96 mark, are likely to support market optimism,"" said Motilal Oswal Financial Services. ""The ongoing rally in the market is being driven by a combination of positive sentiments and fundamentals. The market expects the renewed India-U S trade talks to result in an agreement, culminating in the withdrawal of the 25% penal tariffs imposed on India. If expectations translate into reality, that would be a huge sentiment positive,"" said VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments. ""Fundamentally, the GST reform is expected to trigger an impressive demand spurt led by automobiles. Auto stocks have already rallied, discounting the expectations. White goods, particularly air conditioners, can be beneficiaries. NBFCs financing the purchase of white goods, too, have rallied. Some leading private sector banks like HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank are yet to participate in the rally. These stocks are fairly valued. The Fed is expected to cut rates by 25 bps tonight. More than the rate action the Fed commentary on the evolving economic outlook and the trajectory of future rate action will be closely watched by the market,"" he added.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Bandhan Bank, Ashok Leyland, KEI Industries, Amber Enterprises, Aadhar Housing, Phoenix Mills, and others on September 17?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-bandhan-bank-ashok-leyland-kei-industries-amber-enterprises-aadhar-housing-phoenix-mills-and-others-on-september-17-13551843.html,"Equity benchmark indices rebounded smartly, with the Nifty 50 gaining 0.7 percent on September 16 after minor profit booking in the previous session, supported by healthy market breadth. About 1,779 shares gained against 999 declining shares on the NSE. The market is expected to maintain bullish momentum after surpassing the August swing high. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Amol Athawale, VP-Technical Research at Kotak Securities Tech Mahindra | CMP: Rs 1,531.5  After its declining trend, Tech Mahindra is in the accumulation zone, where it is trading in a range-bound mode on the daily scale. However, recent bullish activity in the stock is indicating good strength. The stock is expected to break out of the range and witness bullish momentum from the current levels, with a favourable risk-reward perspective. For the next few trading sessions, Rs 1,475 could be the trend-decider level for the bulls. If it sustains above this level, we can expect a further uptrend towards Rs 1,630. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,630 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,475 Bandhan Bank | CMP: Rs 162.67  Post its short-term price correction, Bandhan Bank is available near its multiple support zone. The incremental volume activity near this support zone indicates that the downside is restricted. Therefore, the stock is expected to rebound and witness bullish momentum from the current levels. For positional traders, Rs 157 would be the decisive level. Trading above this level, the uptrend formation will continue till Rs 175. However, if it closes below Rs 157, traders may prefer to exit from trading long positions. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 175 Stop-Loss: Rs 157 Ashok Leyland | CMP: Rs 134.54  After the remarkable up move, Ashok Leyland has taken a breather over the last few sessions. The consolidation structure suggests a bullish continuation chart formation. Moreover, the stock comfortably closed above its short-term moving average. Therefore, the stock is likely to resume its uptrend from the current levels in the coming days. As long as the stock is trading above Rs 129, the bullish texture is likely to continue. Above this, the stock could move up to Rs 145. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 145 Stop-Loss: Rs 129 Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors KEI Industries | CMP: Rs 4,179.7  KEI Industries is one of the top performers in its sector over the past week. In the previous session, prices closed above the prior swing high of Rs 4,143 and were up by more than 2% during the day. At the start of September 2025, prices found support at the 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA), and we have seen a rally of more than 9%. As long as the price protects the EMA support of Rs 3,900, the overall bias is likely to remain positive. Additionally, for the past 5 trading sessions, prices have been protecting the prior day’s low on a closing basis, which is acting as a double confirmation. One can use dips towards Rs 4,100–4,130 levels as a buying opportunity, which could take prices higher towards Rs 4,280, followed by Rs 4,390. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 4,280, Rs 4,390 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,900 Amber Enterprises India | CMP: Rs 8,298  Amber Enterprises made a fresh record high near Rs 8,324 and outperformed its sector in the previous session. The stock has continued to inch higher in a higher high and higher low fashion. In the previous session, the stock gave a breakout of a larger Ascending Triangle pattern on the daily chart, which is a strong positive sign. However, for confirmation, follow-up buying is required. On the daily chart, for the past 6 sessions, every candle has closed in green, highlighting its strength. Also, the KST (Know Sure Thing) indicator has turned above the signal line and is also trading above the zero line, suggesting that good momentum is expected to continue. For now, a break above Rs 8,325 is required for bullish momentum to continue towards Rs 8,660, followed by Rs 8,900. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 8,660, Rs 8,900 Stop-Loss: Rs 7,990 Aadhar Housing Finance | CMP: Rs 537.8  On the daily chart, since July 2025, Aadhar Housing Finance was in a sideways trend, consolidating in a range of Rs 490–530. Bullish momentum in the previous session helped the stock give a breakout of this rectangular pattern, and prices also managed to close above it. Currently, Bollinger Bands have started to expand, with a spike in volumes, suggesting that volatility is likely to increase in the coming sessions. Along with this, the MACD has just given a bullish crossover, further supporting the overall stance. A break above Rs 545 can push prices higher towards Rs 570, followed by Rs 590. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 570, Rs 590 Stop-Loss: Rs 520 Vinay Rajani, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities Phoenix Mills | CMP: Rs 1,616  Phoenix Mills has broken out from a downward sloping trendline on the weekly chart. The price breakout is accompanied by a jump in volumes. The stock is placed above all key moving averages, indicating an uptrend across all timeframes. The daily RSI is sustaining above 50, indicating a sustained uptrend for the stock. The daily MACD is placed above its signal line. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,775 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,510 Mirae Asset Nifty MidSmallcap400 Momentum Quality 100 ETF | CMP: Rs 49.41  ETF has recently surpassed the 50 and 200 DEMA resistance. The price breakout is accompanied by a jump in volumes. The daily RSI is sustaining above 50, indicating a sustained uptrend. The daily MACD is placed above both its equilibrium and signal line.

Dr Reddy’s launches novel acid blocker Tegoprazan in India to tap $1 billion market,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/dr-reddy-s-launches-novel-acid-blocker-tegoprazan-in-india-to-tap-1-billion-market-13551538.html,"Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd. on Tuesday announced the launch of a novel gastrointestinal therapy in India, betting on a next-generation acid blocker to strengthen its branded portfolio in a market where nearly four in 10 people suffer from acid-related disorders. The Hyderabad-based drugmaker launched Tegoprazan, a potassium-competitive acid blocker (PCAB), under the brand name PCAB, according to a company statement Tuesday. The drug is indicated for conditions such as erosive and non-erosive gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and gastric ulcers, offering faster onset and longer pH control than conventional treatments, the company said. The rollout follows Dr. Reddy’s exclusive licensing deal with South Korea’s HK inno.N Corp. in 2022 to commercialize Tegoprazan in India and select emerging markets. The molecule is already approved in 21 countries, including South Korea and China, and has completed Phase III trials in the U.S. “We are happy to launch Tegoprazan in India, reinforcing our commitment to innovation in gastrointestinal disease treatment — a key focus area for us,” said M.V. Ramana, chief executive officer for branded markets at Dr. Reddy’s. “Our partnership with HK inno.N brings together complementary strengths to enhance patient access to an innovative molecule that addresses critical gaps in acid peptic disease management,” he added. Acid peptic disorders affect about 38% of India’s population, underscoring the commercial potential for new therapies. In a multinational clinical trial conducted by Dr. Reddy’s across India, South Africa and Russia, 99% of GERD patients on Tegoprazan achieved endoscopic healing by Week 8, the company said. HK inno.N CEO Dal-Won Kwak said the launch marks a milestone for the PCAB class in India. “We hope Tegoprazan will establish itself as a leading innovative therapy and contribute meaningfully to the improvement of gastrointestinal care,” he said. The introduction of Tegoprazan adds to Dr. Reddy’s established gastrointestinal portfolio, which includes brands such as Omez, Razo and Vono. Dr Reddy's has been expanding its branded generics and specialty offerings in India and emerging markets to offset pricing pressure in the US generics segment."

He added that India's defence sector will require several players to help create robust national capabilities, and the group will join hands wherever they see a scope. Chandrasekaran reviewed Solar Industries' capabilities, missile and other defence production facilities during his visit. The Tata Group has been actively participating in defence programmes of strategic importance with the Ministry of Defence (MoD) as well as Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO). No Agenda for Visit? Solar Industries' Chairman, Satyanarayan Nuwal said there was not agenda for the visit, but it was a matter for pride for the company. ""I cannot talk about the future, but there was no fixed agenda, because of which he came here to visit the factory... It was just a courtesy visit. Two days ago, we received a call from the Collector, and he said Mr Chandrasekharan wants to visit. It was indeed a matter of pride for us... The defence requirements and capabilities in India have a lot of scope, throughout the sector..,"" Satyanarayan Nuwal said. Tatas Back Multiple Defence Players Chairman Chandrasekaran told news agency ANI that no single firm can address all of the nation's defence needs, making a case for partnerships where required. ""Defence is a very important sector, and we will need multiple players. Nobody can solve the defence needs of the country alone; we all have to contribute. Wherever there is scope for collaboration, we will always collaborate. Today's visit was about understanding their facility and learning what they have,"" said Chandrasekaran. ""Whether it is ammunition, missiles, or other areas, the requirement for capabilities is immense. I don't want to use the word 'demand' because this is not about business -- it is about building capabilities required for the nation,"" Chandrasekaran added. The Tata Group has partnered with global players for some of the major defence productions for fighter jets, helicopters, weapon systems, unmanned systems, as well as aero engine components.

"Auto stocks rise up to 3% on GST 2.0, festive demand hopes: Here's what brokerages say",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/auto-stocks-rise-up-to-3-on-gst-reforms-festive-demand-hopes-here-s-what-brokerages-say-13550134.html,"The shares of auto companies gained on September 16, after recording losses in four out of the past five sessions. Brokerages remain bullish over the sector's outlook, suggesting strong upside potential for the stocks. The Nifty Auto index rose 0.84 percent to 26,986.75, according to data on NSE at 1.10 pm. This comes amid easing trade tensions between India and US, optimism over India-European Union trade deal and expectations of rising festive demand following GST reforms boosted investor sentiment. GST reforms: Centre recently announced strong cuts to the GST structure, which will take effect later this month. Analysts estimate that the GST rate cuts will strongly spur demand around Navratri, and benefit the automakers. Maruti Suzuki has seen a 15 percent increase in customer inquiries since the GST rate cut announcement, the automaker's Head of Sales and Marketing Partho Banerjee recently told CNBC-TV18. ""Overall bookings now stand at 1.5 lakh, with 10,000 new bookings coming in daily,"" he added. Cooling India-US trade tensions: Indo-US relations have seen some improvement in recent days with Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreeing to resume trade talks. Trump called Prime Minister Modi a ""dear friend"" and talked optimistically about the trade momentum. PM Modi, in turn, reaffirmed India and US as ""close friends and natural partners"" and expressed confidence that current trade talks would unlock significant potential for both nations. Brendan Lynch, a key US trade negotiator arrived today in India to discuss 'trade issues' between Washington and New Delhi. Special Secretary Rajesh Agarwal however clarified that Lynch's one-day visit is not the sixth round of trade negotiations between India and US, but only a meeting to 'discuss' trade issues. The cooling trade tensions between India and US, and increasing hopes of the two countries resuming trade talks may have boosted auto and auto ancillary stocks. India-EU trade deal: India and EU held their 13th round of talks for the proposed trade deal from September 8-12. The next round of talks will be held in Brussels from October 6-10 as both sides aim to conclude negotiations at the earliest. This too may act as a strong boost for the auto and auto ancillary stocks. MRF shares were the top gainers on the index, jumping nearly 3 percent to trade at Rs 1,51,780 apiece. Balkrishna Industries and Bharat Forge shares followed, rising around 2 percent each. Samvardhana Motherson, Bosch, Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M), Eicher Motors and Maruti Suzuki shares gained more than 1 percent each, while TVS Motor, Tube Investments of India and Hero MotoCorp shares were up around 1 percent each. Ashok Leyland, Bajaj Auto and Exide Industries shares were trading in the green with marginal gains. Bucking the trend, Tata Motors shares were trading in the red with marginal losses. HSBC on auto sector: HSBC in its latest report said that GST-driven price cuts announced by the automakers will boost their CAGR by 200-300 basis points over the next four-five years. The international brokerage noted that the auto stocks have jumped 6-17 percent since the centre's GST revision announcement in August. It added that this will likely track earnings growth. Growth could be front-loaded, HSBC said while raising FY27-28 EPS estimates across companies by 4–14 percent. Here are the latest rating and target prices set by the international brokerage:Maruti Suzuki – Buy call, Target price at Rs 17,000 per shareHyundai Motor India – Buy call, Target price at Rs 2,800 per shareTVS Motor – Buy call, Target price at Rs 4,000 per shareM&M – Buy call, Target price at Rs 4,000 per shareAther Energy – Buy call, Target price at Rs 600 per shareInCred on autos: InCred sees GST rate cuts and cess withdrawal as biggest stimulus for auto sector in recent history. It said that these could trigger a two-three year cyclical recovery. The domestic brokerage raised domestic auto volume forecasts by 300 bps to 11 percent for FY26, and by 500 bps to 15 percent for FY27, led by passenger vehicles. InCred has upgraded its ratings on Apollo Tyres, Escorts Kubota, M&M and Tata Motors. Nomura on autos: Nomura said the GST cuts are leading to early signs of demand recovery. It prefers M&M, Hyundai, TVS Motor and Ashok Leyland among the stocks. The cuts have translated into immediate benefits for buyers and firms are reporting stronger enquiries, surge in bookings and an improved outlook for festive demand, the brokerage said.

In the Air compression segment, Tezcatlipoca centrifugal compressors are witnessing strong traction and gaining market share. Refrigeration compressors continue to see robust demand from industrial and commercial end-users, with revenue contribution expected to rise to ~45% (vs ~35% earlier). The Gas compression segment remains subdued, although demand for gas booster packages continues to be healthy. KKPC’s continued new product launches, such as Tyche, are expected to drive the next leg of growth while new initiatives such as RenovAir replacement scheme is expected to pave way for market share gains. Looking ahead, management targets ~20% CAGR in revenues with EBITDA margins scaling up to ~20%, supported by market share gains, new product launches and eventual foray into export markets.

Market participants seek protocol after September’s last-minute holiday change shook the settlement system,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/market-participants-seek-protocol-after-september-s-last-minute-holiday-change-shook-the-settlement-system-13550137.html,"Earlier this month, stock exchanges had received an official communication about a holiday on Monday, September 8, which was previously scheduled on Friday, and while it looked like a routine adjustment, at the back end, this led to big chaos. Sebi’s settlement, which operates on T+1, had to move to T+2 for cash and T+3 for derivatives on short notice. From Sebi to brokers, custodians, foreign portfolio investors, mutual funds, and clearing corporations, everyone has a story to share about how this last-moment tweak forced them to burn the midnight oil to resolve the settlement issues. Thankfully, the settlement was completed without any major issue, but it created chaos at the back end. What Exactly Happened? Once the Maharashtra government announced the change in holiday which was scheduled on September 5, banking regulator RBI changed the bank’s holiday to Monday, September 8, as it had to follow states’ holiday calendar as per the Negotiable Instruments Act. RBI communicated the change in holiday to banks and other entities, and when banks are on holiday, fund settlements can’t happen, leaving investors to wait for their funds. How Did the Tweak Impacted the Market? The stock exchanges and clearing corporations make the settlement calendars a year in advance, based on the dates of holidays, and any changes midway can disrupt the whole cycle. How Did FPIs get Impacted? Foreign Portfolio Investors book their foreign exchange based on a TOMO basis - in simple terms, based on tomorrow’s expected price. In this instance, the forex was booked for Monday, and Friday was a holiday as per the earlier plan. In this case, the calculation and fund arrangement went for a toss. Given that the FPIs trade in huge quantities, any change in forex price can impact the cost of trading. How Did Investors get Impacted? Investors were impacted as the funds expected to be credited into their accounts got delayed, leading to to additional margin requirement as previous margins had got blocked. The BTST or Buy Today Sell Tomorrow trade also got impacted as traders could not get the sale money the next day. The settlement for the derivative segment of three trade days - September 4 (Thursday), September 5 (Friday), and September 8 (Monday) - was undertaken on September 9 (Tuesday). Similarly, the settlement for the cash and SLBM segment for September 8 (Monday) and September 9 (Tuesday) was undertaken on September 10 (Wednesday). Exchanges and clearing corporations had to break the settlement part into two days, otherwise the settlement system would have crashed because of the sheer size of trading volume. Stock exchanges, clearing corporations, custodians, and the regulator had to literally burn the midnight oil to ensure smooth settlement. Custodians Worked till 4 AM As per industry sources, custodians and fund accounting teams had to work till early morning to prepare the files for settlement. Not only this, one industry insider said they also had to face FPI queries on how there could be a sudden change in holidays. Some FPIs even mocked the ‘one nation, multiple regulations’ approach, as they could not understand the nuances of local rules. Corporate Action Trigger Market participants concur that a big chaos was averted as there were no major corporate actions except a few dividend issues. If a bonus announcement or some other issue had been effective from Monday, it could have become an issue, as investors who were eligible may have lost the opportunity because of settlement issues. For example, if one had bought shares on Friday on a cum basis and expected to get them on Monday as Friday was a settlement holiday, but the settlement moved to Tuesday. In such a case, they may have lost significantly as they would have received shares on an ex basis – without the bonus shares and prices adjusted accordingly. In such situations, companies cannot be suddenly asked to change their record dates. Incidentally, exchanges were working on both days, Friday and Monday. Sebi and exchanges also issued an alert to investors about the impact on corporate action ex-date and cum-date. MF Debt Schemes Impacted Market participants said debt fund transactions too were impacted due to the sudden change in holiday schedule. As payments are not processed on holidays but the next business day, unit prices change, and investors get the NAV of the next business day. How to Avoid Chaos Next Time? In a situation like this, market participants said the regulators should have a formal way of communication and assess if the regulated entities get impacted because of the tweaks. It will help the market handle things smoothly. They also said that once the trading day starts, the date of settlement should not change. Some participants also say when 24x7 systems like NEFT, RTGS, and UPI are there, then do we really need a settlement calendar?"

India revokes Novartis' patent for blockbuster heart drug,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/india-revokes-novartis-patent-for-blockbuster-heart-drug-13550194.html,"Indian Patent Office (IPO) has revoked Novartis AG’s patent on its blockbuster heart-failure drug Entresto, sold as Vymada in India, saying the Swiss drug company’s claims lacked novelty. Vymada is widely prescribed for hypertension and heart failure. For Novartis, the drug is a major revenue driver, generating $7.8 billion in global sales last year. The September 12 decision by the deputy controller of patents and designs could pave the way for affordable generics. While cancelling the patent for the “supramolecular complex” of sacubitril and valsartan, the active ingredients in Vymada, D Usha Rao said Novartis failed to show any clear therapeutic advantage of its claimed “supramolecular complex” over existing formulations. The order followed a post-grant opposition filed by the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA), an industry group representing major domestic drugmakers. Two companies — IPCA and Micro Labs — also opposed the patent at the post‑grant stage. “The patentee has failed to disclose any demonstrated advantages or technical advancement of the claimed supramolecular complex over the combination already disclosed…,” the controller wrote in the order. Moneycontrol has reviewed a copy of the order. “No experimental data, comparative studies, or technical rationale have been provided to substantiate any enhanced efficacy. Further, no improved therapeutic efficacy has been shown,” Rao said. The patent fell foul of multiple provisions of the Patents Act. The ruling caps nearly two years of litigation that began in December 2023 when IPA challenged the patent on grounds of lack of novelty, prior claiming, obviousness, and insufficiency of disclosure. The opposing parties twice recommended revocation and after a Delhi High Court-directed round of rebuttal evidence, the controller held a final hearing on August 20. Novartis’s representatives abstained from the proceedings, the order said. On February 13, 2009, Novartis was granted a patent for a drug combining valsartan and sacubitril. That patent expired on January 16, 2023, paving the way for dozens of copycats. Novartis then claimed that a particular crystalline form, for which it was granted patent, was essential to Entresto's function, and blocked generic drugmakers from copying its crystalline form. Indian firms opposed the patent, questioning whether the crystalline form offered a therapeutic advantage over earlier ones.. The controller sided with the opponents, who argued that the patent was an attempt at “evergreening” — extending monopoly rights without meaningful innovation — a practice India’s patent law seeks to curb. Novartis spokesperson declined to comment. The drugmaker can appeal the decision in the Delhi High Court."

"Incentive for shipbreaking on the anvil, select shipping and shipyard stocks abuzz on Centre's global ambitions",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/select-shipping-shipyard-stocks-abuzz-as-centre-targets-global-shipbuilding-market-incentive-for-shipbreaking-13549950.html,"Shares of Essar Shipping and GE Shipping are sharply higher by 2.5-4.5 percent in trade on September 16, along with shipbuilders such as Cochin Shipyard and Mazagon Dock which are gaining by close to a percent each, a day after MoS for Ports and Shipping, Shantanu Thakur said the Centre plans to develop more shipyards and target 5 percent share of global shipbuilding market by 2030. The sentiment in select stocks was positive after Bloomberg News reported citing people familiar with the development that the Centre also has plans to rollout incentives worth Rs 4,000 crore to support the shipbreaking industry, likely by end of September. The incentives would be for the longer term and may also involve credit notes to ship owners bringing old vessels to Indian shores, the report said. Incentive for Shipbreaking This scheme for a shipbreaking credit note was announced in the Union budget and incentivises ship scrapping by issuing credit note for 40 percent of the scrap value, which can be reimbursed to buy new Made in India ships. Moneycontrol is yet to independently confirm the quantum of the incentive, though in the past, it has been reported that the Centre has ambitious plans to incentivize India's domestic shipping industry through various incentive schemes and sops. In this union budget, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had proposed to set up a Maritime Development Fund (MDF) for financial assistance, via equity or debt securities. With an initial corpus of Rs 25,000 crore, MDF will have government's contribution at 49 percent while the rest will be from port authorities, PSUs, financial institutions as well as the private sector. ""While the Shipbuilding Financial Assistance Policy (SBFAP) is designed to provide financial incentives to Indian shipyards, the Ship-breaking Credit Note further strengthens the domestic industry by encouraging investment and expansion. These measures are expected to drive capital inflows, create employment opportunities, and enhance sectoral competitiveness,"" Shipping Minister Sarbananda Sonowal had said after the budget announcement. Eye on Global Shipbuilding Market The Shipping Ministry has plans to develop new shipbuilding clusters of 1-1.2 million Gross Tonnage (GT) each. Sarbananda Sonowal had said earlier this year that public-private partnerships and international collaborations will be crucial to this ambition. ""This strategic push is crucial in realising India’s vision of becoming a $30 trillion economy by 2047. By leveraging the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model, the scheme is designed to attract private investment, promote modernisation, and advance green technologies,"" Sonowal had said. On September 15, MoS for Ports and Shipping, Shantanu Thakur had told a CII conference that India plans to add 10 world-class shipyards in the next five years. The government plans to develop ""10 world-class shipyards by 2030, supported by public-private partnerships and international collaborations that will bring global best practices to Indian shores,"" Shantanu Thakur had said. ""We are targeting a 5 percent share in the global shipbuilding market by 2030, a significant leap from our current position. This will be achieved through strategic investments in automation, digital twin technology and green shipbuilding innovations,"" MoS for Ports and Shipping added."

Brendan Lynch, a trade negotiator with the Office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) will be arriving today in India to discuss 'trade issues' between Washington and New Delhi. Special Secretary Rajesh Agarwal however clarified that Lynch's one-day visit is not the sixth round of trade negotiations between India and US, but only a meeting to 'discuss' trade issues. India-US trade relations: The two nations had opened negotiations for a Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) in March this year, and have conducted five rounds of talks so far, with the last one being held in July in the US. However, following US President Donald Trump's decision to double tariffs on India to a whopping 50 percent, the next round of trade talks slated for August 25-29 in New Delhi was deferred. Cooling trade jitters: Indo-US relations have seen some improvement in recent days with Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreeing to resume trade talks. Trump called Prime Minister Modi a ""dear friend"" and talked optimistically about the trade momentum. PM Modi, in turn, reaffirmed India and US as ""close friends and natural partners"" and expressed confidence that current trade talks would unlock significant potential for both nations.India and the US are close friends and natural partners. I am confident that our trade negotiations will pave the way for unlocking the limitless potential of the India-US partnership. Our teams are working to conclude these discussions at the earliest. I am also looking forward… pic.twitter.com/3K9hlJxWcl — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) September 10, 2025 Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman too confirmed that New Delhi's diplomatic team is deeply engaged in ongoing negotiations. In a post on Truth Social, Trump had said, ""I am pleased to announce that India, and the United States of America, are continuing negotiations to address the Trade Barriers between our two Nations."" Textile stocks surge: All these developments reignited hopes for easing trade tensions between the two countries, which would likely benefit the export-oriented textile stocks. Indo Count Industries shares rallied around 10 percent to trade at Rs 307.79 apiece. KPR Mill shares surged 7 percent to trade at Rs 1,121.80 apiece, while Pearl Global Industries shares jumped nearly 6 percent. Raymond Lifestyle shares jumped nearly 4 percent. Arvind shares rose around 2 percent.

"Trump's tariffs bite off Rs 25,000 crore from shrimp exporters' profit, Andhra CM Chandrababu Naidu seeks Centre's help",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/trump-s-tariffs-bite-off-rs-25-000-crore-from-shrimp-exporters-profit-andhra-cm-chandrababu-naidu-seeks-centre-s-help-13549463.html,"Trump's tariffs may have caused a loss of Rs 25,000 crore to India's shrimp exporters, with up to half of the export orders facing cancellations, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu has said. Chandrababu Naidu pegged the estimate in a letter to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal and Fisheries Minister Rajiv Ranjan Singh, requesting government support for Andhra's aquaculture sector. “The taxes imposed by America majorly hit shrimp exports. It is estimated that a loss of Rs 25,000 crore would have occurred. Up to 50 percent export orders have been cancelled,” Chandrababu Naidu said in the letter. Andhra Pradesh makes up 80 percent of India's shrimp exports, worth over Rs 21,000 crore every year. During FY24, India exported record volume of seafood worth $7.38 billion, with USA and China being the major importers and frozen shrimp the largest export item, according to data from Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA). During FY25, India shipped seafood worth Rs 62,408 crore ($7.45 billion). Naidu has called for a Rs 100 crore corpus fund, cold storages, and seafood markets, adding that the state is ready to set up a shrimp producers' committee to ensure farm-to-market supply chains. The state government has also initiated support measures by getting aquaculture feed prices lowered by Rs 9 per kg and is considering subsidised power transformers for the farms. CM Naidu has also sought a one-time top-up loan of Rs 1 lakh under Kisan Credit Card scheme for the farmers. This comes as the European Union approved 102 additional seafood processing and export units from India just days ago, a move that will boost seafood exports and position the nation as a trusted supplier. ""This milestone will enable us to scale our EU trade, empower our farmer partners, and reaffirm India’s leadership in sustainable aquaculture and seafood exports,"" Chairman and Managing Director of Kings Infra, Shaji Baby John said on September 10. EU-bound exports from India had reached Rs 9,430 crore ($1.12 billion) last fiscal, led by frozen shrimps among the leading items. India is also in discussions with the EU for a wider FTA, with the next round of discussions scheduled on October 6-10. The EU is the third largest export destination for Indian shrimps, with US and China being the top two markets, in terms of turnover. In terms of quantity, China has emerged as the largest seafood export destination from India. CareEdge Ratings in a recent note had warned that if the current tariff levels persist, the hit on exports may be more pronounced next fiscal, and volumes may drop by up to 15 percent. India, along with Ecuador, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, and China are the largest players in the global shrimp export market with a combined market share of around 75% in value terms and 74% in volume terms. Despite the export levy, shares of Avanti Feeds and Kings Infra are higher by 10 percent and 5 percent respectively over the last one month, while shares of Waterbase are flat for the period.

Godfrey Phillips shares surge 9% after turning ex-bonus: Here's why you should ignore the 66% plunge,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/godfrey-phillips-shares-surge-9-after-turning-ex-bonus-here-s-why-you-should-ignore-the-66-plunge-13549379.html,"The shares of Godfrey Phillips appeared to have crashed around 66 percent in one single session on September 16, as the stock price adjusted to a bonus issue of shares. The stock in reality jumped more than 9 percent after turning ex-bonus. Godfrey Phillips' board of directors during a meeting in August had approved the issue of bonus shares in the ratio of 2:1. The record date to determine the eligibility of the shareholders set to receive the bonus equity shares was set on September 16. What is a bonus issue? A company announces bonus issue of shares to reward its existing shareholders with an investment opportunity, which is perceived to be attractive. While the issue of bonus shares increases the total number of shares issued and owned, it does not change the market capitalization of the company. This increases the overall liquidity of the stock, and makes it more affordable for other investors to add to their portfolio, creating strong upside potential for the stock. Godfrey Phillips share price: Key details As a result, Godfrey Phillips’ shares appeared to have crashed 66 percent in one session, while in reality, they simply adjusted to the bonus issue. The stock jumped more than 9 percent to hit an intraday high of Rs 3,720 apiece. After the issuance of bonus shares, the company's market capitalization stands at around Rs 57,401 crore and the stock's P/E ratio nears 161. The issuance of bonus shares will likely increase investors' confidence for the stock, as it reflects on the firm's strong financials and growth potential. Bonus issue essentially are free shares offered by a company from its reserves. Investors must own shares of the company as on the record date to be eligible for the bonus issue.

Asian stocks gain at open after Wall Street rally,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/asian-stocks-gain-at-open-after-wall-street-rally-13548551.html,"Asian stocks posted modest gains at the open after Wall Street hit fresh highs ahead of an expected Federal Reserve interest-rate cut this week. Shares in Japan, Australia and South Korea opened higher, with the MSCI Asia-Pacific Index hovering near its record high. S&P 500 contracts were steady, as a $14 trillion record-breaking run in US equities headed for an inflection point, with the expected rate cut set to dominate a week that will shape policy for half of the world’s 10 most-traded currencies. Bets on Fed easing sent the S&P 500 above 6,600 on Monday, while the Nasdaq 100 posted its longest advance since 2023. Also aiding sentiment was a framework deal to keep TikTok running in the US, with President Donald Trump saying he’d talk to China’s Xi Jinping on Friday. A gauge of the dollar steadied after sliding in the prior session. Gold held its gains after rising to a new record. Signs of labor-market weakening and no major inflation surprises have sealed the deal for what money markets project will be a quarter-point Fed cut in September. The big question, though, will be the pace of easing after that, with prices stubbornly above the central bank’s 2% target. “Now the discussion will turn to how aggressively the Fed will act,” said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley. “The Fed may remind everyone that it may be focused on jobs now, but it hasn’t forgotten about the other half of its mandate.” In other Fed news, a US appeals court blocked the president from removing Governor Lisa Cook from her post while her lawsuit challenging the dismissal proceeds. Also, Trump’s economic adviser Stephen Miran is on his way to joining the central bank’s board after the Senate confirmed him to the post. On Wednesday, US policymakers will also release their quarterly update of economic and rate forecasts — known as the dot plot — and Fed Chair Jerome Powell will hold his regular post-decision press conference. In June, Fed officials were narrowly in favor of two quarter-point cuts in 2025. What traders will really hang on to is the tone of Powell’s press conference and the “dot plot” projections, according to Fawad Razaqzada at City Index and Forex.com. “I’ll be watching how the market reacts to any mention of inflation being ‘well anchored’ or the labor market ‘cooling more than expected’,” he said. “That sort of language would be music to the ears of dollar bears. On the flip side, a cautious Fed that hints at a ‘wait and see’ approach might stall the rally, at least temporarily.” Separately, JPMorgan Chase & Co. will cut the weight of the largest bond issuers in its flagship emerging-market index, diverting investor flows from the likes of China and India toward smaller nations."
"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Cochin Shipyard, Olectra, Sarda Energy, Lupin, Siemens, NBCC, Nava, Aditya Birla Real Estate, and others on September 16?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-cochin-shipyard-olectra-sarda-energy-lupin-siemens-nbcc-nava-aditya-birla-real-estate-and-others-on-september-16-13548507.html,"The benchmark indices closed moderately lower, with the Nifty 50 snapping its eight-day winning streak on September 15, but the market breadth was positive. A total of 1,539 shares advanced compared to 1,283 declining shares on the NSE. The market may remain consolidative with rangebound trading until the August high is decisively broken. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi Cochin Shipyard | CMP: Rs 1,807.8  Cochin Shipyard has established a strong technical base with a triple-bottom pattern in the Rs 1,650–1,700 zone, reinforcing investor confidence at lower levels. The stock has now given a trendline breakout, further validated by a bullish divergence on the MACD histogram, signaling a likely shift in momentum. Adding to the positive setup, the price has managed to close above the R4 Camarilla monthly pivot—a crucial breakout level—indicating strength in the current trend. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 1,820–1,780 zone, with an upside target of Rs 2,100. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,100 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,650 ITI | CMP: Rs 322.55  ITI is showing encouraging signs of strength after successfully holding near its previous demand and breakout zone, reinforcing a solid support base. The stock has recently managed to close marginally above the monthly pivot, a breakout level that often signals continuation of an uptrend. On shorter timeframes, hourly charts are reflecting bullish divergence, further validating the possibility of momentum picking up in the near term. This confluence of technical indicators suggests an attractive risk-reward setup. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 325–315 zone, with an upside target of Rs 380. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 380 Stop-Loss: Rs 290 Aditya Birla Real Estate | CMP: Rs 1,866.2  A strong base formation is observed in the Rs 1,780–1,830 zone, providing a solid support area for Aditya Birla Real Estate. This zone also coincides with a previously established demand zone, reinforcing its significance. Recently, a trendline breakout has been witnessed around this region, supported by a positive signal on the MACD histogram, which indicates a shift in momentum. Such technical alignment between base formation, demand zone support, and momentum breakout strengthens the case for potential upside. As long as prices hold above the Rs 1,780–1,830 zone, the outlook remains constructive, with scope for a sustained move higher in the near term. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 1,840–1,870 zone, with a target of Rs 2,050. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,050 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,755 Vidnyan S Sawant, Head of Research at GEPL Capital NBCC India | CMP: Rs 107.66  NBCC has witnessed a breakout from a flag and pole chart pattern in the prior week, signaling a potential bullish continuation. Additionally, the stock has shown a mean reversion from the 50-week EMA, which aligns with the 50% Fibonacci retracement level, indicating strong buying interest at key technical support. On the momentum front, the RSI has exhibited a bullish divergence, and the positive crossover further reinforces the likelihood of a trend reversal, suggesting building upward momentum. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 121 Stop-Loss: Rs 102 Olectra Greentech | CMP: Rs 1,647.4  Olectra Greentech has shown positive price action across multiple timeframes, reflecting sustained bullish momentum. On the monthly chart, the stock is forming a higher top–higher bottom structure, indicating a strong uptrend. On the weekly timeframe, the stock found support near the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level, from where it has resumed its upward trajectory—signaling renewed buying interest and bullish sentiment. Furthermore, the RSI remains above 60, reinforcing the view of sustained positive momentum in the stock. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,877 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,560 Nava | CMP: Rs 705  Nava has been in a sustained uptrend since the 2020 bottom, and recent price action suggests continued strength. On the monthly chart, the stock formed a base near its 12-month EMA, and the breakout in August indicates a robust price structure with the potential for further upside. On the weekly timeframe, the stock is trading firmly above key moving averages—namely the 5-, 12-, and 26-week EMAs—signaling strong trend alignment. Additionally, the RSI is holding near 70, highlighting solid momentum and sustained bullish sentiment. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 775 Stop-Loss: Rs 675 Sarda Energy & Minderals | CMP: Rs 626.15  Sarda Energy continues to remain in a strong uptrend on the monthly chart. In August, the stock broke out of a 10-month consolidation zone, signaling a shift in momentum. The current month reflects continued buying interest, further validating the breakout. The stock is now trading at all-time highs, indicating robust bullish momentum. Additionally, the presence of a bullish divergence adds strength to the overall positive outlook. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 725 Stop-Loss: Rs 595 Jay Thakkar, Vice President & Head of Derivatives and Quant Research at ICICI Securities Lupin | CMP: Rs 2,046  Lupin has provided a breakout from the falling trendline, with short-covering data in its futures segment clearly indicating a short-term trend reversal from down to up. There has been clear Call unwinding at the Rs 2,040 and Rs 2,100 strikes, which is positive, and there have been aggressive Put additions as well, indicating support at lower levels. The stock is trading well above its maximum pain level of Rs 2,000, indicating that the short-term trend is positive. Buy Lupin Futures in the range of Rs 2,030–2,050. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,130, Rs 2,160 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,980 Siemens | CMP: Rs 3,293.7  Siemens has provided a breakout and a close above the symmetrical triangular pattern, with short-covering data in the futures segment, which is a positive sign in the near term. There were significant shorts in the stock, and with the short-term trend reversal in the price, further short covering can’t be ruled out. The options data suggests that above the Rs 3,300 strike, there will be additional short covering, as it has the highest Call base. Beyond these levels, there will likely be even more short covering. The stock has closed well above its maximum pain level of Rs 3,200; hence, there is good support at lower levels. Buy Siemens Futures in the range of Rs 3,300–3,320. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,420, Rs 3,500 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,230 Reliance Industries | CMP: Rs 1,399.3  Reliance Industries has provided a breakout from the falling trendline, with short-covering data in the futures segment, which is a positive trend reversal sign in the near term. The stock has closed at Rs 1,400 levels, which has the highest Call base; hence, this is also positive in the near term. There has been considerable Call unwinding from the Rs 1,360 to Rs 1,400 strikes, as well as Put additions at the Rs 1,400 strike, indicating support at lower levels. So, there is a higher probability of further short covering in the near term. Buy Reliance Futures in the range of Rs 1,400–1,405. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,460, Rs 1,480 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,370 Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol are their own and not those of the website or its management.

"Sebi bars API maker Par Drugs from slump sale, orders independent valuation and fairness opinion",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sebi-bars-api-maker-par-drugs-from-slump-sale-orders-independent-valuation-and-fairness-opinion-13548166.html,"Capital Market regulator Sebi has restrained Par Drugs and Chemicals (PDCL) – a maker of active pharma ingredients - from proceeding with the proposed slump sale of its business to promoter-related entity PJFCP under a Business Transfer Agreement (BTA) dated February 14, 2025. The move comes amid concerns over non-compliance with disclosure norms and potential prejudice to public shareholders interests. Sebi’s interim order has directed the NSE to appoint a registered valuer to independently assess the fair market value of the business undertaking that is slated for transfer. The valuation must adhere to recognized standards and appropriate methodology, said Sebi. The appointed valuer is required to submit the valuation report within three months of the order date, following which the NSE must obtain a fairness opinion from a merchant banker within one month of receiving the valuation report. Both the valuation report and fairness opinion, along with NSE’s recommendations, must be submitted within 15 days of the fairness opinion’s receipt. Sebi’s interim order passed by Whole Time Member Kamlesh Chandra Varshney said, “PDCL is restrained from effecting the transactions agreed upon in the BTA dated February 14, 2025 for Slump Sale of its business undertaking to PJFCPL.” He further said, “If the proposed slump sale transaction is allowed to proceed, it could cause grave injustice to the public shareholders since the transaction would become irreversible upon execution.” Varshney justified the interim order and said, “I find that there exist sufficient grounds to form a prima facie opinion that the proposed slump sale transaction by PDCL may be detrimental to the interests of public shareholders and warrants urgent intervention by SEBI in form of interim directions.” The Interim order noted that prima facie findings of investigations have made a compelling case for passing directions, given the possible violations of the provisions of Sebi’s Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices Regulations, 2003, and Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements Regulations, 2015 and other laws. Also Read: Sebi’s Jane Street order based on wider probe, sources cite legal precedent to withhold internal notes The order follows a complaint alleging that PDCL’s slump sale is being executed at an artificially low valuation to benefit promoter-related entities at the expense of public shareholders. It was claimed that the slump sale would result in the transfer of the company’s core profit-making business on undervalued terms, which had already led to a significant erosion of PDCL’s market capitalization. Sebi’s preliminary investigation revealed that the valuation reports submitted by PDCL focused exclusively on six physical assets, including industrial land, office premises, and plant machinery. No value was attributed to intangibles such as employees, goodwill, brand equity, or technical knowledge, which are core elements of a profitable going concern. The financial data from PDCL over the last five years has shown consistent positive operating as well as net profit, underscoring that standard industry practice requires business valuation to reflect the going concern’s value, rather than just individual assets. Sebi said the valuers were seemingly instructed to treat the slump sale as a mere sale of separate assets, in contradiction to the Business Transfer Agreement, which clearly described the transfer of the entire business undertaking as a going concern. PDCL’s market capitalization plummeted from Rs 428.76 crores before the slump sale announcement in December 2024 to Rs 139.74 crores by September 2025, a decline of nearly 70 percent. The stock price experienced sharp fall in correlation with major slump sale events, including the announcement of the board’s decision, the outcome of two extraordinary general meetings (EGMs) and the final shareholder approval of the transaction. Also Read: Axis MF front-running case: Former fund manager Deepak Agrawal settles with Sebi The order further directed PDCL, its management and all signatories to the BTA to immediately cease and desist from any alienation of the business’ assets, pending further orders. The company is also mandated to fully cooperate with the independent valuer and submit all information and documents as required. PDCL has 21 days to file its reply or objections to the Sebi order and may request a personal hearing."

PLI certification for Gen 3 scooters: Earlier in August, Ola Electric had announced that it has received certification of compliance under the PLI scheme for automobiles and auto components, granted by the Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) under the Ministry of Heavy Industries. The approval covers all seven scooters in Ola’s S1 Gen 3 line-up — including the S1 Pro 3 kWh, S1 Pro 4 kWh, S1 Pro+ 4 kWh, S1 X 2 kWh, S1 X 3 kWh, S1 X 4 kWh and S1 X+ 4 kWh. The company noted that both its Gen 2 and Gen 3 scooters are now PLI-certified.

Click to View More Outlook for September 16 Vaibhav Vidwani, Research Analyst at Bonanza Today, the Indian stock market ended on a negative note, snapping its recent winning streak as both the Sensex and Nifty 50 posted mild declines by market close. The Sensex fell by 118.96 points to settle at 81,785.74, while the Nifty 50 declined by 44.8 points, closing at 25,069.2. The negative sentiment was primarily attributed to global uncertainty ahead of the upcoming US Federal Reserve policy meeting, which kept investors cautious and led to subdued activity across Asian markets. Investors were also seen booking profits after a stretch of market gains, particularly in heavyweight IT stocks and consumer-facing sectors, mirroring international caution and reduced risk appetite. Broader market participation saw more decliners than advancers as nervousness crept in before US Fed policy signals and key global negotiations. Volatility remained low, with indices trading within tight bands through most of the session. Looking ahead, we can expect the market trend to remain muted and rangebound until there is greater clarity from the US Federal Reserve regarding its policy trajectory. Market participants remain watchful for global cues and domestic macroeconomic data, with buying expected on dips for fundamentally strong sectors such as BFSI, auto, and consumption.

"Infosys' mega Rs 18,000-crore share buyback: What works and what doesn't? Here's what analysts say",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/infosys-mega-rs-18-000-crore-share-buyback-what-works-and-what-doesn-t-here-s-what-analysts-say-13546852.html,"Infosys share price came under pressure on Monday after the company announced its largest-ever share buyback of Rs 18,000-crore, with analysts pointing to tax implications as major dampener. The board of the IT major on September 11 approved repurchase of up to 10 crore fully paid-up equity shares of face value Rs 5 each, representing 2.41 percent of the total paid-up capital, at a price of Rs 1,800 per share. The buyback price reflects a premium of around 18 percent over Friday’s closing price on the NSE. At the end of the June 2025 quarter, Infosys reported free cash flow of Rs 7,805 crore. Despite the announcement, the counter slipped 1.6 percent to an intraday low of Rs 1,501.20 on the NSE in today's trading session, reversing gains made in the previous session on Friday. Analysts attributed the weakness to taxation rules and profit-booking. ""The acceptance ratio is likely to be low and this coupled with taxation doesn’t make the buyback an attractive proposition in the secondary market,"" said Sunny Agrawal, Head – Fundamental Research, SBI Securities. Tax Implications for Investors on Buybacks Ajit Mishra, Senior Vice President – Research, Religare Broking, said investors’ decision to tender would largely depend on tax considerations. ""Since October 2024, buyback proceeds are taxed as dividend in shareholders’ hands, making the offer less attractive for those in higher tax brackets. For low-tax or tax-exempt investors, tendering could provide gains if the acceptance ratio, particularly under the small shareholder quota, is favourable,"" he noted. On Monday, IT stocks were broadly lower with the Nifty IT index slipping nearly 1 percent, led by selling across all 10 constituents. The decline came as global investors awaited US Federal Reserve cues on rate cuts. Ruchit Jain, Vice President, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, said part of the positive impact was already factored in as reports on a buyback were circulating earlier. He added that the overall weakness in the IT sector had also weighed on sentiment. Additional concerns emerged after US President Donald Trump’s recent remarks on potential tariffs on IT services imports, which analysts said could impact margins for Indian exporters. ""Markets are pricing in the possibility of higher operating costs and slower client spending in the near term,"" said Harshal Dasani, Business Head, INVasset PMS. Dasani added that currency movements were also being tracked closely. ""An elevated INR against the dollar squeezes revenues when converted to rupees, putting short-term pressure on earnings,"" he said. What Investors Should Do? Experts suggested caution in the near term. ""The buyback signals confidence, but short-term volatility is being driven by policy and currency shocks,"" said Dasani. Mishra from Religare Broking added, ""Long-term investors may simply hold, as the buyback reduces equity by 2.4 percent and modestly enhances EPS."" Infosys Buyback History Infosys has previously undertaken four buybacks. The first was in 2017 for Rs 13,000 crore, followed by Rs 8,260 crore in 2019, Rs 9,200 crore in 2021, and Rs 9,300 crore in FY23. What is a Share Buyback? A share buyback is a process where a company repurchases its own shares, reducing the number of outstanding shares in the market.

"Prestige Estates, DLF, other real estate stocks jump up to 12%: Here are three reasons",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/prestige-estates-dlf-other-real-estate-stocks-jump-up-to-12-here-are-three-reasons-13547157.html,"The shares of several real estate companies jumped on September 15, pushing the Nifty Realty index up around 2.6 percent. The index emerged as top sectoral gainer on September 15. The Nifty Realty index rose to 908 in the afternoon, the highest level seen by the index in 13 sessions. Here are three reasons which may be boosting the sector. US Fed rate cut hopes: The US Federal Reserve is set to hold its FOMC meeting from September 16 to September 17. Analysts increasingly expect the American central bank to cut its rates this time, amid weakening jobs data and rising pressure from President Donald Trump's administration. The US economy likely created 911,000 fewer jobs in the 12 months through March than previously estimated, according to the latest data from Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics. This further hiked rate cut hopes. While Indian real estate players are mostly domestic market oriented, analysts expect a rate cut by the US Federal Reserve to be followed by the same by its Indian peer RBI. A rate cut by RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee will reduce home loans EMIs for home buyers, spurring demand and thereby boosting real estate stocks. UP govt plans changes to bylaws for Noida, other areas, says report: The Yogi Adityanath-led Uttar Pradesh government is planning to remove the ground coverage limits and increase the floor area ratio for industrial, residential and commercial projects as part of its new common building bylaws for the three industrial development authorities—Noida, Greater Noida, and YEIDA, the Times of India reported citing sources. This will likely ease construction rules, boost investment and end confusion caused by differing regulations across authorities, the report further said, adding that the prospective rules will allow both vertical and lateral growth. Moneycontrol couldn't independently verify the report. If approved, these reforms will likely benefit the real estate players active in these areas, including Godrej Properties and DLF. Value Buying: The Nifty Realty index has sharply corrected from its record high level. The sectoral index is currently down more than 20 percent from its 52-week high of 1140.4. It has fallen nearly 10 percent in the past three months, and is down around 13 percent in 2025 so far. After such sharp correction, investors may have resorted to value buying, pushing the stocks higher. Govt considers 20-year tax break for data centres, says report Anant Raj shares were the top gainers on the index, skyrocketing around 12 percent to trade at Rs 598 apiece. This comes after a report said that the government is considering a 20-year tax break for data centres. Prestige Estates shares jumped nearly 3 percent to trade at Rs 1,593 apiece. DLF shares also surged around 3 percent to trade at Rs 779 apiece. Phoenix Mills, Godrej Properties, Oberoi Realty and Macrotech Developers (Lodha) shares jumped nearly 3 percent each. Sobha, Brigade Enterprises and Raymond shares rose around 2 percent each.

The sectoral index fell nearly 0.3 percent (over 72 points) to 26,794 in the afternoon. This comes despite brokerages remaining bullish over the sector's prospects. HSBC on auto sector: HSBC in its latest report said that GST-driven price cuts announced by the automakers will boost their CAGR by 200-300 basis points over the next four-five years. The international brokerage noted that the auto stocks have jumped 6-17 percent since the centre's GST revision announcement in August. It added that this will likely track earnings growth. Growth could be front-loaded, HSBC said while raising FY27-28 EPS estimates across companies by 4–14 percent. Here are the latest rating and target prices set by the international brokerage:Maruti Suzuki – Buy call, Target price at Rs 17,000 per shareHyundai Motor India – Buy call, Target price at Rs 2,800 per shareTVS Motor – Buy call, Target price at Rs 4,000 per shareM&M – Buy call, Target price at Rs 4,000 per shareAther Energy – Buy call, Target price at Rs 600 per shareInCred on autos: InCred sees GST rate cuts and cess withdrawal as biggest stimulus for auto sector in recent history. It said that these could trigger a two-three year cyclical recovery. The domestic brokerage raised domestic auto volume forecasts by 300 bps to 11 percent for FY26, and by 500 bps to 15 percent for FY27, led by passenger vehicles. InCred has upgraded its ratings on Apollo Tyres, Escorts Kubota, M&M and Tata Motors. Nomura on autos: Nomura said the GST cuts are leading to early signs of demand recovery. It prefers M&M, Hyundai, TVS Motor and Ashok Leyland among the stocks. Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M), Eicher Motors and Bosch shares dropped more than 1 percent each.  Ashok Leyland, Exide Industries, Hero MotoCorp, Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors, TVS Motor and Bajaj Auto shares were trading in the red with marginal losses. Bucking the trend, Tube Investments of India shares gained nearly 4 percent. Samvardhana Motherson shares jumped nearly 3 percent after CLSA kept an ‘Outperform’ call on the stock, and raised its target price to Rs 124 per share.

This diversification was achieved via high growth in existing products like Construction Finance & Housing Finance growing at a CAGR of ~44% and ~48% respectively over FY22 to FY25. Further, the successful launch of Gold Loans via an addition of 562 branches in FY23, growing the branch base significantly led to consolidated 3 year AUM CAGR of ~51% over the same period. Gold Loans are the highest yielding product, improving portfolio yields by ~155 bps over FY23 to FY25. We forecast CGCL will be able to sustain these higher yields as Gold Loans now form a significant ~36% of the total AUM. Further, a rating upgrade is likely to improve Cost of Funds; whereas more efficient branch unit-economics & operational leverage will expand NIMs & improve the cost to income ratio. Outlook We value CGCL using the Residual Income Approach. We calculate Cost of Equity to be at 11.3% with ROEs projected to reach 18.3% by FY28E supported by Income Growth & softening costs. We initiate coverage with a “BUY” rating and upside of 22%, implying P/ABV of 2.9x / 2.5x of FY27E/FY28E.

"Pharma index snaps four-day rally as Dr Reddy's, Biocon, other shares slide up to 2 percent: Factors at play",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/pharma-index-snaps-four-day-rally-as-dr-reddy-s-biocon-other-shares-slide-up-to-2-percent-factors-at-play-13546578.html,"The shares of leading pharma majors fell in trade on September 15, weighing on the Nifty Pharma index by more than a percent in mid-day trade and as the gauge snapped a four-day gaining streak on profit booking at elevated levels. The Nifty Pharma index emerged as one of the top losing sectors in the trading session for the day. Top Pharma Losers Dr Reddy's shares were the top loser on the index, down nearly 2 percent after the company disclosed an observation by the US Food & Drug Administration (USFDA) following a Pre-Approval Inspection (PAI) at its biologics manufacturing facility in Bachupally, Hyderabad on September 12. ""We have been issued a Form 483 with five observations, which we will address within the stipulated timeline,"" the company said. J B Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals shares fell 1.5 percent to trade at Rs 1,673.40 apiece. Torrent Pharma, Biocon, Aurobindo Pharma, Glenmark Pharma and Natco Pharma shares fell more than a percent each, while Lupin, Zydus Life and Sun Pharma shares were down nearly a percent each. Ajanta Pharma, Cipla, Laurus Labs and Mankind Pharma shares were trading lower with marginal losses. Bucking the trend, Granules and Abbott India shares gained more than a percent each while Gland Pharma, Alkem Labs, Divi’s Labs and IPCA Labs shares were in the green with marginal gains. Uncertainty over Trump tariffs Despite easing trade tensions between India and US, the fear of higher Trump tariffs on pharma imports weighed on Indian exporters. While increasing tariffs on Indian exports to a whopping 50 percent, US President Trump had exempted pharma supplies for such levy. However, earlier in August, Trump said he eventually plans to increase the tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the US to 250 percent, without elaborating on the timeline or other details. Most Indian pharma companies derive a major portion of their revenue from exports to the US market. In an interview to CNBC International, Trump had said that he would begin with a “small tariff” but plans to raise it gradually - first to 150 per cent, and eventually to 250 per cent - within a year to 18 months. In April, the Trump administration had launched a Section 232 investigation into pharmaceutical imports, to examine if certain imports pose a threat to national security. “We want pharmaceuticals made in our country,” Trump told CNBC. BioSecure Act In 2024, the United States had introduced the BioSecure Act to enhance the security of biotechnology supply chains. While the bill successfully passed the House of Representatives, it failed to advance to the Senate. The bill sought to reduce China’s influence on America's biotech supply chains and safeguard against any potential biotech espionage. A diluted version of BioSecure Act is now again back into consideration in the US, as per some news reports. What Analysts Say? ""The Indian pharmaceutical sector has faced notable pressure in 2025, with leading companies seeing steep corrections amid pricing challenges in the US and regulatory headwinds...Despite these near-term headwinds, the structural outlook remains intact,"" said Kalp Jain, Research Analyst at INVasset PMS. ""India continues to supply over 20 percent of the world’s generic medicines, while rising domestic healthcare spending and insurance penetration provide steady growth drivers. Niche areas such as Contract Research, Development and Manufacturing (CRDMO) are gaining traction, with companies like Divi’s Laboratories and Piramal Pharma well-positioned to capture global outsourcing demand. Industry estimates suggest 25-30 percent potential upside in select CRDMO players, supported by strong order pipelines and differentiated models. Specialty drugs, complex generics, and branded formulations also offer promising opportunities to offset cyclical pressures in the US generics market,"" he added. Also Read: Our LIVE blog on stock market updates The Nifty Pharma index is down nearly 5 percent so far this year, and a recovery is expected to be gradual, according to pharma analysts. Regulatory clarity, easing pricing pressure in exports, and sustained traction in specialty therapies will be key triggers, said one market expert. ""While generic-heavy portfolios may take longer to recover, companies with diversified product lines, strong balance sheets, and leadership in high-margin categories appear better placed. With valuations moderating after recent corrections, selective accumulation in quality names could offer attractive returns once the broader sector stabilizes,"" Kalp Jain said. Santosh Meena, Head of Research at Swastika Investmart meanwhile said, ""Pharma stocks are not following a uniform trend, as their performance is diverging based on company-specific fundamentals and news flows. However, the overall outlook for the sector remains positive, with the Nifty Pharma Index trading above all its key moving averages, indicating a bullish bias."" ""Nifty Pharma Index has broken out of an ascending triangle pattern, signaling a bullish trend reversal. Sustained buying interest above key moving averages indicates renewed momentum, positioning pharma stocks for further upside in the coming sessions.Laurus Labs, Zydus Life, and Lupin exhibit bullish chart patterns, breakouts above key averages, signaling strong technical upside momentum,"" said Vishnu Kant Upadhyay, Assistant Vice President – Research & Advisory at Master Capital Services Limited.

"Brooks Labs looks to exit carbapenem JV, OneSource may buy stake",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/brooks-labs-seeks-to-exit-carbapenem-jv-onesource-may-buy-stake-13546621.html,"Brooks Laboratories Ltd is looking to sell its 49 percent stake in Brooks Steriscience Ltd, a joint venture with Steriscience Specialties, sources have told Moneycontrol. The move comes after OneSource Specialty Pharma Ltd received the board's approval to evaluate a potential acquisition of the carbapenem manufacturing facility in Gujarat’s Vadodara, which makes antibiotics primarily used for severe, multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. This move could provide a significant cash infusion for Brooks. Established in 2015, the Vadodara facility has become a critical asset in the global anti-infectives supply chain, with approvals from key regulatory bodies including the USFDA, EU GMP, and ANVISA. Its strategic value was bolstered after the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved its meropenem 2g injection on June 23. It makes Brooks Steriscience the first company to receive clearance for the higher-strength formulation of meropenem, an antibiotic used to treat serious bacterial infections in adults and children, in the US market. The 2g strength provides a crucial dose option for treating serious infections. This regulatory milestone followed USFDA approvals for 0.5g and 1g meropenem injections in August 2022. Earlier this month, Brooks secured shareholder approval to divest its investment in Brooks Steriscience, citing the ""best interest of the company"". The potential buyer, OneSource Specialty, formerly Stelis Biopharma, announced in August that its board had given in-principle approval to evaluate the acquisition of Steriscience’s sterile injectable businesses, including the Vadodara facility. Brooks Laboratories' rationale for the sale is rooted in its recent financial performance. While the company saw a 107 percent jump in profit before tax to Rs 3.23 crore in FY25, its liquidity remains stretched, with working capital utilization hovering around 90 percent. The company also holds a guaranteed debt of Rs 65 crore on behalf of the joint venture. A successful divestment would strengthen Brooks' balance sheet, reduce its exposure to guaranteed debt, and free up capital to focus on its core business of critical care injectables and CDMO services. Promoters Atul Ranchal and Rajesh Mahajan, who hold 19.24 percent and 17.36 percent, respectively, in Brooks, are industry veterans with over two decades of experience. Their focus has been on expanding Brooks’ footprint in critical care, CDMO, and semi-regulated export markets. Both Ranchal and Mahajan couldn’t be reached for comments. The Brook Laboratories shares had risen almost 30 percent since its JV secured approval for meropenem 2g in the US. On the morning of September 15, the stock was trading at Rs 160 on BSE, up 1.3 percent from the previous close. "

KTAs: 1) The Northeast remains one of the fastest cement consuming regions, with ~10% medium-term CAGR backed by infrastructure spends of Central/state governments. 2) Led by upcoming capacity expansions, Star aims to strengthen its leadership in the Northeast, beyond its current volume market share of ~27%. 3) The unlikely entry of any new player in the Northeast in the next ~4Y would augur well for cement prices. 4) Star aims to diversify geographically, with clear expansion plans in Rajasthan; it has already secured limestone mines in the state through government auctions. 5) It is on track to reach capacity of ~18mtpa (vs ~8mtpa currently) in the medium term. 6) Focus remains on cost-efficiency through capex on efficiency parameters. We like Star’s regional dominance and endeavor to stretch its leadership over peers in the Northeastern market. Further, entry into Rajasthan will help it shed the tag of a regional player and establish its brand in North India, coupled with >2x its existing capacity base. We note that the recent surge in the stock price (up >30% in the past 2M) could limit upside in the near term. Outlook Also, at the CMP, Star trades at ~11x FY27E EV/EBITDA, ie near +1SD (5Y mean).

"Infosys, TCS, other IT stocks decline as investors await Fed cues on rate cut path",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/infosys-tcs-other-it-stocks-decline-as-investors-await-fed-cues-on-rate-cut-path-13546096.html,"The shares of information technology (IT) companies came under selling pressure in Monday’s trade as investors awaited signals from the US Federal Reserve on the pace of interest rate cuts. Infosys was the biggest drag, slipping 1.32 percent to Rs 1,505.40 on the NSE even after its board approved a share buyback worth Rs 18,000 crore last week. Infosys will buy 10 crore fully paid-up equity shares of a face value of Rs 5 each, representing up to 2.41 percent of the total paid-up equity share capital, at Rs 1,800 per share. Tata Consultancy Services and Tech Mahindra also traded lower, declining up to 1.07 percent. The Nifty IT index was the top sectoral loser, dropping nearly 1 percent. All 10 constituents of the index traded in the red, reversing gains of 0.3 percent made in the previous session. The Federal Reserve is expected to deliver its first rate cut of the year this week amid signs of a cooling labour market, though political developments are adding uncertainty to the decision. Since its last cut in December, the Fed has kept rates steady at 4.25–4.50 percent while monitoring the impact of tariffs on inflation. According to Bloomberg, the markets broadly anticipate a 25-basis-point reduction when the two-day policy meeting concludes on Wednesday. Investors will closely track Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s comments for guidance on the pace of further rate cuts.

This comes despite benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty hovering in the red. The Nifty Smallcap 100 index rose more than 0.7 percent to 18,117.50 in the morning, while the Nifty Midcap 100 index was up around 0.3 percent to 58,378.80, as seen as 10.30 am.

Top midcap gainers: Vodafone Idea shares were the top gainers on the Nifty Midcap 100 index, jumping more than 6 percent to trade at Rs 8.12 apiece. This comes as the Supreme Court is set to hear the telecom company’s plea on AGR (Adjusted Gross Revenue) relief on September 19, as per reports. The debt-ridden company had moved the top court against an additional Rs 9,450 crore AGR demand by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), arguing that the fresh dues exceed the scope of the Court’s earlier ruling on AGR liabilities. Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA) and Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL) shares followed, rising more than 4 percent each. HUDCO shares were up over 3 percent, while Tube Investments of India and Cochin Shipyard shares rose nearly 3 percent.

What analysts say? The outperformance of small- and mid-cap indices over benchmarks signals a healthy broadening of the market, said Harshal Dasani, Business Head at INVasset PMS. ""In corrective phases, investors usually prefer large caps and index-heavy names for safety and liquidity, as they limit drawdowns even if returns are modest. But as markets edge towards record highs, fear subsides and risk appetite gradually returns, prompting flows into mid- and small-caps where growth potential is greater,"" he said. ""This shift is now evident, with the broader market taking leadership in the rally. Historically, such transitions mark the start of stronger participation from both retail and domestic institutions, creating breadth that supports sustainable uptrends. For long-term investors, this is a constructive development as it suggests the rally is not restricted to a few index movers but underpinned by wider earnings momentum and sectoral opportunities, reinforcing confidence in the resilience and depth of the current market cycle,"" he added. Explaining the technical side of the broader markets, Vishnu Kant Upadhyay, Assistant Vice President – Research & Advisory at Master Capital Services Limited, said, ""Smallcap and Midcap indices have delivered a bullish reversal, breaking out from a double bottom formation on daily charts. Both Nifty Smallcap 100 and Nifty Midcap 100 have crossed above key moving averages, confirming strength after weeks of consolidation. This signals renewed momentum and positions the broader markets to outperform benchmarks in the near term. Midcaps like TIINDIA, Nykaa, Alkem Labs and smallcaps like Welspun, Radico, KEC Intl show bullish breakouts, strong momentum, sector tailwinds.""
