Buy Axis Bank; target of Rs 1375: Prabhudas Lilladher,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-axis-bank-target-of-rs-1375-prabhudas-lilladher-13294073.html,"Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Axis Bank AXSB saw a weak quarter yet again as core PAT missed PLe by 26.6% due to asset quality related technical impact of Rs6.14bn. Adjusting for the same, core PAT missed PLe by 17% owing to lower NIM and fees. Owing to more stringent recognition criteria, gross slippages were more by Rs27.1bn (one-time impact). In our view, this may also reflect the underlying stress. As bank does not intend to further change the recognition policy, upcoming quarters of FY26 and FY27 would see lower credit costs since stress is moderating in PL/CC. Outlook We raise provisions for FY26 by 8bps but reduce it for FY27E by 3bps. For FY26/27E, we cut NIM by 6bps and trim fees by avg. ~2.0%; core PAT is lower by 5.1%/2.6%. Due to 7bps reduction in core RoA for FY26 to 1.4%, we tweak multiple to 1.8x from 1.9x and cut TP to Rs1,375 from Rs1,500. Retain ‘BUY’.

For the June quarter, Clean Science’s revenue rose 8 percent year-on-year to Rs 240 crore, while Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) grew 5 percent over the same period to Rs 100 crore. Margins for the quarter contracted by 100 basis points to 41.7 percent compared to 42.8 percent a year ago, while net profit increased by 6 percent year-on-year. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog Over 25 percent of the company’s revenue during the quarter came from newer product launches, and the management noted that the company also gained market share in this period. However, the company revised its EBITDA growth guidance to 15–18 percent (down from the earlier 18–20 percent) citing softness in the first quarter of FY26 and global headwinds. Management said it expects a stronger ramp-up starting Q3FY26, with revenue acceleration in the second half of FY26 driven by new product launches, improved capacity utilisation, operating leverage, and market expansion. The promoters of Clean Science, who currently hold a 74.97 percent stake in the company, are evaluating the sale of a minority stake as part of their family estate planning and management, the management shared during the earnings call. Motilal Oswal reiterated its ""neutral"" rating on the stock, with a target price of Rs 1,350 per share. The brokerage cut its FY26 and FY27 estimates by 9 percent each, citing higher tax rates, but expects a revenue, EBITDA, and PAT CAGR of 23 percent, 23 percent, and 27 percent, respectively, over FY25–27. Meanwhile, HDFC Securities maintained a ""sell"" rating with a target price of Rs 1,029 per share. The brokerage said it expects the return on equity (RoE) to remain around 20 percent and EPS to grow at an 18 percent CAGR between FY25 and FY29. HDFC Securities noted that valuations remain high at 48x and 41x FY26 and FY27 estimated EPS, respectively. It added that Q1 EBITDA was 8 percent below its estimates, while PAT was 9 percent below expectations due to lower-than-expected revenue.

The sequential dip in topline was due to lower sales of newer products such as DCC and TBHQ. The Pharma & Agro Intermediates segment witnessed the sharpest decline, with revenue down 32% QoQ. Volume for the company’s established products remained strong, supporting a robust standalone EBITDAM of 46%, driven by lower raw material costs. HALS volume stood at 540tn. The management reiterated its guidance of 4,500tn for HALS volume in FY26, with new HALS grades priced at USD11–35/kg expected to be launched over the coming quarters. HALS is likely to break even at the EBITDA level by Q2FY26, with monthly sales expected to reach Rs100mn. The HALS subsidiary reported EBITDA loss of Rs80mn in Q1FY26. On the capex front, water trials at Performance Chemicals 1 are scheduled for Aug’25, with commercialization of the facility targeted for Sep. Performance Chemicals 2 is on track for commercialization in Q4FY26. Looking ahead, these new capacity additions are expected to be key growth drivers. Outlook However, the company’s margin profile may face some pressure, as certain new products such as HALS are expected to yield lower profitability compared to the legacy portfolio. At its current valuation of 41x FY27 EPS, we maintain ‘HOLD’ rating on CLEAN, with target price of Rs1,425 valuing it at 40x FY27 EPS.

The growth performance in Consumer and BFS (beyond CAPCO) was weak. The discretionary budgets were tight in Consumer and Manufacturing, especially in Europe, otherwise AI-led transformation and modernization of data witnessed steady recover in Q1. The exceptional large deal TCV (including 2 mega deals) is a mix of both renewals and NN. The large wins are a strategic outcome of securing the existing books while building new offerings on top. However, the nature of the deals is concentrated more on the vendor consolidation and cost optimization side, which ideally comes at a higher tenure and lower margins. The early part of the deals would require investments in right sizing the talent base and setting up stage for deployment, which ultimately leads to take a hit on the margins. We expect the ramp up of two mega deals to support growth in H2, while also considering the underlying weakness and slower conversion. We are revising our estimates to -1.5%/+3.4 YoY CC (vs -2.5%/2.9% earlier), while cutting our margin estimates by 30/40bps for FY26E/FY27E to 16.9%/17.1%.

Hold LTIMindtree; target of Rs 5340: Prabhudas Lilladher,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/hold-ltimindtree-target-of-rs-5340-prabhudas-lilladher-13293833.html,"Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on LTIMindtree The revenue growth was broadly in line to our estimates of 0.8% QoQ CC, partly aided by a ramp up of a large deal ($450m) within Retail segment. The deal is expected to see further ramp up and achieve its full potential as it progresses through Q2. Surprisingly, the management remained cautious on BFS, hinting to account-specific weakness, rather than an industry-wide challenge. The growth performance of CMT (1.1% QoQ) and Manufacturing (0.4% QoQ) was also weak vs Consol business growth of 2% QoQ in USD. We believe the large deal ramp up would support the growth in the rest of the year, while we are also cognizant of the fact of the underlying demand weakness. Hence the growth beyond the scope of large deal would be limited. The askrate for a similar growth (FY25) in FY26 would be ~2% CQGR, which we believe is achievable, given the order inflows were elevated while rate of conversion remains stable. We are baking in CC revenue growth of 4.8% and 8.2% YoY in FY26E/FY27E, while keeping our margins unchanged. With that our EPS sees an upgrade of ~2% in FY26E/FY27E. We assign PE of 27x to FY27 EPS, valuations are largely capped. Retain HOLD. Outlook We are factoring in a USD revenue and earnings CAGR of 7% and 13%, respectively. The stock is currently trading at 26x its FY27E earnings, and we assign a target PE of 27x FY27E earnings to arrive at a target price of INR 5,340. Given the limited upside from current levels, we maintain our “HOLD” rating.

Markets are in Ajit’s ‘Liquid Oxygen’ state: Kotak's Pratik Gupta,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/markets-are-in-ajit-s-liquid-oxygen-state-kotak-s-pratik-gupta-13293609.html,"Equity markets are caught in a tight band—unable to rise meaningfully or fall sharply—much like Bollywood villain Ajit’s famous ""liquid oxygen"" trap, said Pratik Gupta, Co-head and CEO at Kotak Institutional Equities, in an interview with CNBC-TV18 this morning. Agarwal recalled Ajit’s classic cult dialogue: “Mona Darling, isko liquid oxygen mein daal do. Liquid isko jeene nahin dega, oxygen isko marne nahin dega” (Put him in liquid oxygen. The liquid won’t let him live, the oxygen won’t let him die), to illustrate the market’s current dilemma. Tepid earnings growth and a steady supply of new equity paper are capping the upside, while strong domestic flows continue to cushion the downside, he said. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates While near-term sentiment remains cautious, there is still hope pinned on a recovery in earnings during the second half of the financial year, he added. At present, market valuations remain elevated, with the Nifty trading at around 22 times forward earnings, levels that are considered expensive by historical standards. Earnings growth has been tepid across key sectors such as IT, consumer goods, and banking, all of which are expected to post single-digit growth for the full year. Also read: Fund Manager Survey: Sentiment turns most bullish since 2024; India slips to fourth rank in Asia, according to BoFA Despite the weak first-half performance on the cards, Pratik expects earnings momentum to pick up meaningfully in the second half, supported by festive demand, margin tailwinds from easing input costs, and an uptick in government-led capital expenditure. Overall, full-year earnings growth is still projected at around 11 percent. A few key triggers could help support sentiment and improve the outlook, including a potential trade deal with the US, a reduction in retail-level petrol and diesel prices, and tweaks to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime. However, the most meaningful catalyst is expected to be a significant government capex push in the second half of the year, which could revive investment and support broader economic growth. "

The company’s revenue came in at INR 1,70,587 Mn. (- 6.4% QoQ /+20.5% YoY), below our estimates, mainly due to regional consolidation and weak palm oil sales. The growth was primarily driven by edible oils and industry essentials.

Over the past five trading days, the stock of this real estate company has gained 6 percent, compared with a 0.5 percent decline in the benchmark Nifty 50 index. The company said it acquired the 48-acre land parcel in the Doddaballapur micro-market of North Bengaluru. Godrej Properties added that the site is located near the Satellite Town Ring Road (STRR). The development on this land will primarily consist of plotted units, with an estimated development potential of around 1.1 million square feet. This acquisition follows the company’s announcement earlier this week of a 50-acre residential land deal in Raipur. The Raipur property, situated close to central Raipur, the railway station, Swami Vivekananda Airport, and the upcoming Raipur–Hyderabad and Raipur–Visakhapatnam expressways, will be developed into a premium plotted residential project with an estimated saleable area of approximately 9.5 lakh square feet. Last month, Godrej Properties reported sales worth over Rs 2,000 crore during the launch of the first phase of Barca at Godrej MSR City in Devanahalli, Bengaluru. Also last month, the company announced another acquisition in Pune, acquiring 16 acres in the Upper Kharadi locality. This project, located near IT hubs such as Viman Nagar, Magarpatta, and Hadapsar, is expected to generate revenue of around Rs 3,100 crore.

"LTIMindtree shares fall 2% after in-line Q1 results, brokerages share mixed stance",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/ltimindtree-shares-fall-2-after-in-line-q1-results-brokerages-share-mixed-stance-13293435.html,"Shares of LTIMindtree fell over 2 percent to Rs 5,078 apiece on July 18 after the company posted an in-line set of results for the April-June quarter (Q1FY26). While brokerages maintained their ratings on the stock following the Q1 numbers, they indicated limited upside from current levels. Morgan Stanley, which has an ""Equal-weight"" rating with a target price of Rs 5,400, noted that the management expects to sustain both growth and margin momentum. However, the brokerage felt that the commentary could have been more bullish if macroeconomic conditions were more supportive. Morgan Stanley added that LTIMindtree’s limited earnings per share (EPS) changes compared to peers is a positive sign. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog Global brokerage HSBC maintained its ""Buy"" rating and raised the target price to Rs 6,000 from Rs 5,900 earlier. HSBC said the Q1 performance was broadly in line with expectations and reflected continued improvement in the company’s fundamentals. Over the medium to long term, it expects LTIMindtree’s growth to be nearly double that of mega-cap IT companies, with scope for strong growth acceleration at still-attractive valuations. Nuvama also reiterated its ""Buy"" rating and sharply increased its target price to Rs 6,200 from Rs 5,200. The brokerage believes LTIMindtree occupies a unique position — trading below the expensive, high-growth Tier-2 IT firms and above the cheaper, low-growth Tier-1 firms. According to Nuvama, this places the company in a sweet spot for “growth at a reasonable valuation” with a favourable risk-reward profile. On the other hand, Nomura maintained a ""Neutral"" rating with a target price of Rs 5,040. It highlighted improving growth visibility but added that FY26 is likely to be a “year of repair” and accounted for a slightly higher tax rate in its forecasts. For the June quarter, LTIMindtree reported a 10.6 percent rise in net profit to Rs 1,254.1 crore. Revenue from operations increased 7.6 percent to Rs 9,840.6 crore, compared to Rs 9,142.6 crore in the same quarter of FY25.

""At the same time, rate-sensitive sectors like auto, realty, and select banking, along with continued interest in defensives like FMCG and pharma, are not only limiting the losses but also offering ample long-side trading opportunities,"" he added. Most NSE sectoral indices slipped into the red on Friday. The Nifty Bank and Private Bank indices were among the worst performers, falling 0.91 percent and 1.33 percent, respectively. Consumer durables, energy, infra, FMCG, IT, and oil & gas sectors also slipped between 0.2 and 0.7 percent.

However, brokerages remain in a wait-and-watch mode as the management has guided for a stronger recovery in the second half of this fiscal year. So far in 2025, the stock of this IT services major has declined 13 percent, compared with a 5 percent gain in the benchmark Nifty 50 index. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog Motilal Oswal reiterated its ""sell"" rating on Wipro, with a target price of Rs 230 per share, citing a soft start to the year. The brokerage noted that while strong total contract value (TCV) from deals and early signs of stabilisation in Europe prompted a slight upward revision to FY26 and FY27 earnings estimates (by around 2 percent), there is limited room for margin expansion from current levels. They added that further improvement in execution and consistent conversion of deal wins to revenue will be key to turning constructive on the stock. Analysts at Choice Broking maintained their ""reduce"" rating with a target price of Rs 252. They pointed out that future performance depends heavily on execution and evolving macroeconomic conditions, as demand remains uncertain. According to analysts, Wipro expects Q2 revenue to grow between minus 1 percent and plus 1 percent sequentially in constant currency terms. The company expects a stronger start to the second half of FY26, supported by large recent deal wins and a healthy pipeline. Analysts believe that topline recovery will depend on favorable macro conditions and the positive impact of the Phoenix deal signed in Q4FY25, which could help rebound growth in Q3FY26 and position the company well for H2. Nuvama also maintained a ""hold"" rating with a target price of Rs 270, stating that strong deal wins should support growth in the coming quarters. The brokerage said it is awaiting clearer signs of macroeconomic improvement and consistent performance to turn more positive on the stock. It raised its FY26 and FY27 earnings estimates by 4.3 percent and 1.6 percent, respectively, on expectations of higher growth. Goldman Sachs kept its sell rating on Wipro but slightly raised its target price to Rs 254 from Rs 247 earlier. JPMorgan stayed neutral, maintaining its target price at Rs 260.

The brokerage pointed out that Q1 margins (NIM) undershot expectations and the bank reported a big miss on asset quality.

Here is how financial markets across the globe fared overnight: GIFT Nifty (Gains) The GIFT Nifty is trading higher at around 25,205.50, indicating a positive start for the day. Asian Equities (Up) Asian stocks advanced as a global equity rally gained fresh vigor on strong economic data that eased concerns about the US economy. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. jumped after a bullish outlook.  US Equities (Up) The S&P 500 stock index and the Nasdaq Composite both finished at record highs on Thursday, as investors embraced strong economic data and earnings reports that showed American consumers remained willing to spend. The Nasdaq has ended at a record high in six of the previous seven sessions, and the S&P 500 has had six best finishes since June 27. The Nasdaq Composite gained 153.78 points, or 0.74%, to 20,884.27, and the S&P 500 increased 33.66 points, or 0.54%, to 6,297.36.

"Sensex, Nifty likely to open higher on positive global cues; key levels to track on July 18",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sensex-nifty-likely-to-open-higher-on-positive-global-cues-key-levels-to-track-on-july-18-13292560.html,"Benchmark indices Nifty and Sensex are poised to open higher on July 18, buoyed by firm global cues and hopes of a strong finish to an otherwise uncertain week. A rebound on Wall Street—driven by better-than-expected US retail sales data and a drop in weekly jobless claims—lifted the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to fresh record highs, setting a positive tone for Asian markets as well. Back home, the previous session ended on a sour note as late-day selling pressure, intensified by the weekly expiry, dragged the Nifty below the 25,200 mark and pulled the Sensex down by over 350 points. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) were net sellers to the tune of Rs 3,694 crore worth of shares in Indian equities, while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) net bought Rs 2,820 crore worth of shares. Here are the key levels to watch out for in today's session The psychological support of 25,000 remains intact, while the 25,350 mark continues to act as a formidable ceiling. Until the index breaks out from this congestion zone, significant directional moves are unlikely to unfold. From a technical standpoint, Nifty continues to trade below its 10-day and 20-day exponential moving averages, both of which are near the 25,250 mark. This highlights the persistent selling pressure near the upper boundary of the current range. ""Key support remains established at 56,600, while 57,350 persists as a strong resistance cap. Unless the index decisively moves beyond these levels, any meaningful trend development remains unlikely,"" Dhupesh Dhameja of SAMCO Securities said. ""The Relative Strength Index (RSI) continues to hover around the neutral 50 mark, reflecting a lack of conviction from both ends and reinforcing the ongoing consolidative structure. With earnings season set to kick off for major banking heavyweights, the index could likely find a fresh directional trigger in the coming sessions,"" he added. India VIX remained virtually unchanged, slipping marginally by 0.02 percent to settle at 11.24, staying well below the crucial 13 threshold. The prolonged low volatility environment indicates that while bears are active on rallies, there is no evident panic or fear-driven selling. This suggests the current phase is one of measured consolidation rather than capitulation. The Put-Call Ratio (PCR) has slipped from 0.80 to 0.69, signalling aggressive call writing and a declining bullish bias. The relatively low PCR reading reinforces the negative sentiment prevailing in the market.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade V-Guard, Mahindra Holidays, Prestige Estates, Zydus Wellness, Welspun Corp, Blue Star and others on July 18?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-v-guard-mahindra-holidays-prestige-estates-zydus-wellness-welspun-corp-blue-star-and-others-on-july-18-13291887.html,"Equity benchmarks reversed most of the gains seen in the previous couple of sessions and closed 0.4 percent lower on July 17, but the market breadth was moderately weak. About 1,393 shares declined compared to 1,261 advancing shares on the NSE. The market needs a close above short-term moving averages for an upward journey; until then, consolidation may continue. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Jay Mehta, Technical Analyst at JM Financial Services V-Guard Industries | CMP: Rs 404.15  V-Guard has formed a bullish reversal inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on the daily chart, with a breakout on Thursday backed by rising volume and a golden crossover of the 50-day and 200-day EMAs. Momentum indicators like RSI and MACD are in bullish zones with positive crossovers, supporting the upward trend. The breakout candle has broken through a tight consolidation range since July 4, characterized by indecisive spinning top candles. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 430, Rs 450 Stop-Loss: Rs 380 Mahindra Holidays & Resorts India | CMP: Rs 363.7  Mahindra Holidays broke above a resistance trendline established since July 2024, accompanied by a gap-up opening suggestive of a breakaway gap, potentially initiating a bullish trend. The price now trades above key EMAs, which will serve as dynamic support. Thursday's elevated volume reflects strong buying interest, corroborated by bullish momentum indicators. A move above Rs 377 could accelerate the upward trajectory. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 390, Rs 400 Stop-Loss: Rs 341 Elgi Equipments | CMP: Rs 553.6  Elgi Equipments achieved a breakout from a tight consolidation range on July 9, which had been in place since June 2, 2025, and is currently retesting this zone. Thursday's price action found support at the confluence of the 200-day and 20-day EMAs. A breakout above the immediate resistance at Rs 568 could trigger an extension of a complex inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, targeting Rs 600, Rs 635, and Rs 655. Positive volume growth during the breakout, followed by reduced volume on the retest, alongside momentum indicators trading in bullish territory, supports the bullish outlook. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 600, Rs 635, Rs 655 Stop-Loss: Rs 512 Mandar Bhojane, Senior Equity Research Analyst at Choice Broking Prestige Estates Projects | CMP: Rs 1,783.2  Prestige Estates is currently showcasing a strong bullish setup, supported by a confluence of patterns across multiple timeframes. The stock is on the verge of a breakout from a Cup and Handle formation on the weekly chart, while it has already broken out of a falling trendline on the daily chart. This structure suggests strong accumulation and decreasing selling pressure, as the price consolidates just below the breakout zone. A decisive close above Rs 1,790, supported by higher volumes, would confirm the breakout and potentially trigger a sharp upmove. The stock is trading well above its 20, 50, 100, and 200-day EMAs, indicating strength across short-, medium-, and long-term trends. Momentum is also supportive — the RSI at 70 is trending upward, showing strong buying interest without overbought signals. Traders may consider a buy-on-dips strategy near Rs 1,720. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,000 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,680 Zydus Wellness | CMP: Rs 2,102.1  Zydus Wellness is consolidating near a key breakout zone, signaling underlying strength. On the daily chart, the stock is forming an Inverted Head and Shoulders pattern, a classic bullish reversal setup. Increasing volumes during the consolidation phase reflect growing investor interest and raise the probability of an upside breakout. A decisive close above Rs 2,125 would confirm the pattern breakout and could trigger strong bullish momentum. The RSI stands at 65.4 and is trending upward, indicating healthy momentum with more room to the upside. On the downside, immediate support lies at Rs 2,050, which can be considered a potential buy-on-dips zone for positional traders. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,360 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,975 Welspun Corp | CMP: Rs 931.9  Welspun Corp is on the verge of a breakout from a Flag and Pole pattern on the daily chart. This setup, combined with rising volumes, indicates renewed buying interest and suggests a potential trend shift in favour of the bulls. Technically, the RSI stands at 55.11 and is trending upward, also showing a bullish divergence, which reinforces the case for strengthening momentum. On the downside, Rs 905 acts as a strong support level and can be viewed as a key accumulation zone on dips. If the stock sustains above current levels with continued volume participation, it may move towards the short-term target of Rs 1,035. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,035 Stop-Loss: Rs 880 Om Mehra, Technical Research Analyst at Samco Securities Godrej Consumer Products | CMP: Rs 1,278.2  Godrej Consumer Products has resumed its upward momentum after a brief pause in the uptrend. The recent breakout above the Rs 1,245–1,255 zone has been accompanied by a noticeable rise in volume, confirming strength behind the move. The stock has witnessed a bullish crossover, with the 9-EMA now trading above both the 20-EMA and the 50-EMA, indicating strong alignment across short- to medium-term averages. The stock continues to hold above the 50-day simple moving average, currently placed at Rs 1,240, which now serves as immediate support. The RSI stands at 63 and remains in the bullish zone, while the MACD continues to show a positive crossover with widening histogram bars, highlighting the ongoing momentum. The stock is currently forming a Cup with Handle pattern (bullish), and the price is holding firmly near the breakout zone. Improving volume participation validates the recent breakout and supports the bullish continuation. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,360 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,230 Blue Star | CMP: Rs 1,882.6  Blue Star has registered a decisive breakout from a classic Cup formation on the daily chart. The breakout above the neckline resistance at Rs 1,850 has occurred with a steady rise in volume, confirming participation and validating the pattern’s completion. The stock is now holding above the 9, 20, and 50-day moving averages. Importantly, the close is just below the 200-SMA, and a follow-through above Rs 1,890 would further strengthen the trend confirmation. The overall structure displays clean higher lows on the right side of the cup, with rising volume supporting the upward drift. The recent consolidation just below the neckline acted as the handle portion, which resolved positively. The RSI stands elevated at 70, staying in the bullish zone without divergence. The MACD remains positively aligned above the signal line, indicating continued strength. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,970 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,835 Gujarat State Petronet | CMP: Rs 335.8  Gujarat State Petronet (GSPL) has broken out of a short-term contracting triangle on the daily chart. The pattern exhibits a series of higher highs and higher lows, and the breakout candle has closed firmly above the previous resistance, indicating an ongoing bullish trend. The stock has managed to close above the 20-EMA and the 50-day simple moving averages. This move, following a narrow-range consolidation, suggests an improving short-term setup. However, the immediate zone of interest now lies around Rs 338–340, which may act as a minor hurdle. The RSI has risen to 57 and is gradually trending higher, while the stochastic oscillator has crossed above 70, supported by a clean signal-line crossover. Both indicators are pointing to improving momentum. Volume has held steady in recent sessions.

"SEBI member hints at increase in tenure of F&O contracts, raises concerns over huge volume in short-term contracts",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sebi-member-hints-at-increase-in-tenure-of-f-o-contracts-raises-concerns-with-huge-volume-in-short-term-contracts-13289373.html,"SEBI whole-time member Ananth Narayan on July 17 expressed concerns over huge volume in short-term F&O contracts and also said that the regulator would look improve the quality of the F&O market ""by extending the tenure and maturity of the products and solutions on offer"". ""As many experts have pointed out, our Indian derivative market ecosystem is quite unique, in that on expiry days, comparable turnover in index options are often 350 times or more the turnover in the underlying cash market –an imbalance that is obviously unhealthy, with several potential adverse consequences,"" said Narayan at 11th Capital Markets Conclave of CII in Kolkata. ""Research has suggested that expiry day option trading increases market volatility and could lead to noise trading that may potentially undermine confidence in price formation. Unlike longer term derivatives, short-term derivative products such as expiry day trading in index options may detract from capital formation,"" added Narayan. Narayan said the market regulator must look to deepen cash equities markets. ""We must look for further ways to further deepen our cash equities markets, even as we look to improve the quality of our derivatives market by extending the tenure and maturity of the products and solutions on offer,"" said Narayan. SEBI’s own updated research shows that 91% of individual traders incurred net losses trading in F&O in FY25, with their aggregate losses crossing Rs 1 lakh crore. ""This is a large sum of money that could have otherwise gone towards responsible investing and capital formation,"" said Narayan. Clearly indicating that the regulator is uncomfortable with the volume of weekly F&O contracts, he said that SEBI is aware of the potential concerns of exchanges, brokers, and other intermediaries, as their revenues depend heavily on the volumes of these weekly contracts. However, he also emphasized the need to reconsider whether such a trend is sustainable. He highlighted the steps SEBI has taken in the past to curb the volume of weekly contracts. October 1 last year, SEBI issued a circular and tightened the rules—such as limiting weekly expiries to only one benchmark index, increasing lot sizes, mandating upfront collection of premiums, removing margin benefits on expiry day, introducing intraday monitoring of position limits, and increasing margins near contract expiry. In May 2025, SEBI announced another set of measures to address the issue of rising equity derivatives volumes. These include tracking future-equivalent open interest, linking the market-wide position limit (MWPL) to cash volumes, allowing position creation for single stocks during the ban period if it reduces risk, intraday monitoring of market-wide position utilization, fixing position limits for index futures and options, and establishing new criteria for derivatives on benchmark indices. Ananth Narayan also called for deepening the cash market. He said, “We must look for further ways to deepen our cash equities markets, even as we strive to improve the quality of our derivatives market by extending the tenure and maturity of the products and solutions on offer.” Narayan concluded by stating that all stakeholders need to engage in constructive dialogue on the issue."
"The ""technical"" one-time hit behind Axis Bank's Q1 miss - management explains",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/the-technical-one-time-hit-behind-axis-bank-s-q1-miss-management-explains-13291646.html,"Axis Bank’s June quarter earnings were impacted by a one-time technical adjustment, which resulted in higher slippages and weighed on profitability. To explain this impact, the bank’s CFO Puneet Sharma used a simple example in its post-results conference call: Imagine a customer, let’s call them X — who has a personal loan of Rs 100 and is already 5 days overdue. The bank’s collections team assesses that X may not be able to fully repay and offers a one-time settlement (OTS): the loan will be repaid in three installments of Rs 30 each, with a 90-day moratorium before payments begin. During the moratorium, the days-past-due (DPD) counter continues to move because no payment has been made yet. On the 95th day, after the moratorium ends, X pays Rs 30, clearing all past overdue amounts and resetting the DPD to zero. ALSO READ: Axis Bank Q1 earnings hurt by higher slippages from one-time technical adjustments Earlier, the bank would have upgraded the account’s status to “good” as soon as the DPD returned to zero, even though the customer still owed Rs 70. But now, under stricter technical parameters, the bank does not immediately upgrade such accounts. Instead, it waits until all settlement terms are fully honored and other qualitative checks are satisfied. This shift — from relying purely on DPD to applying stricter, qualitative criteria — meant more accounts stayed classified as bad loans, resulting in higher reported slippages for the quarter. Specifically, the technical impact pushed Q1 slippages to Rs 8,200 crore, of which about Rs 2,709 crore was attributable to these new parameters. Without the technical adjustment, slippages would have been Rs 5,491 crore. The technical impact also weighed on profitability metrics: it reduced Q1 profit after tax by Rs 614 crore, lowered return on assets by 15 basis points, and pulled down return on equity by 140 basis points, the bank said. By tightening its rules, Axis Bank said that they opted for a more cautious approach to classifying loans, prioritising repayment quality over just the overdue count resetting to zero. Having said that, Sharma noted that this is one example. ""The criteria changes across multiple examples. We would not like to discuss all of them on the call,"" he added.

‘Inverted C’ margin path: Axis Bank outlines how NIMs will move this cycle,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/inverted-c-margin-path-axis-bank-outlines-how-nims-will-move-this-cycle-13291534.html,"Axis Bank’s bottom line in the June quarter was impacted by one-time technical adjustments, which led to higher slippages and a temporary deterioration in asset quality. The bank also saw its net interest margin (NIM) contract by 25 basis points year-on-year to 3.8 percent. Looking ahead, the management expressed confidence that margins will remain around the current level of 3.8 percent through the rate cycle — the cycle that began with the last repo rate cut. “Our stated position is that we are confident we can deliver a 3.8 percent margin on a through-cycle basis,” the management said during the post-results conference call. ALSO READ: Axis Bank Q1 earnings hurt by higher slippages from one-time technical adjustments “We believe margins will return to the levels we have indicated over time. Think of the margin trajectory as an inverted C — margins dip initially when rate cuts are announced and then climb back up towards the end of the cycle,” the bank explained. On how the next quarter might play out, Amitabh Chaudhry, CEO of Axis Bank, added that the full impact of the most recent rate cuts has not yet been fully reflected in earnings. “In the current quarter, we have fully absorbed — on a full book and full quarter basis — the first 25 basis points rate cut. The next 75 basis points rate cut has only partially flowed through so far,” Chaudhry said. “In the coming quarter, the full effect of that 75 basis points cut will be visible. However, it will also be partly offset by savings from lower deposit and borrowing costs. Since over 70 percent of our loan book is floating, the direction of margins is quite clear,” he explained.

Axis Bank Q1 earnings hurt by higher slippages from one-time technical adjustments,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/axis-bank-q1-earnings-hurt-by-higher-slippages-from-one-time-technical-adjustments-13291439.html,"Axis Bank reported a 4 percent year-on-year drop in net profit, which stood at Rs 6,034 crore for the June quarter (Q1FY26). The decline was due to a one-time “technical impact”, which affected how the bank recognised slippages and upgrades. The bank explained that it applied new technical parameters for recognising certain accounts as slippages or upgrades, which led to higher reported slippages for the quarter. “This technical impact is largely limited to cash credit and overdraft accounts, and to accounts that have been given one-time settlements,” said Puneet Sharma, Chief Financial Officer at Axis Bank during the post-results conference call. “Because of this, the reported numbers for gross slippages, net slippages, credit costs, NPA ratios, ROA, and ROE are not directly comparable with the figures from previous quarters or the same period last year,” he clarified. ALSO READ: Axis Bank Q1 results: Net profit declines 4% to Rs 5,806 crore, NII marginally up The bank pointed out that without this one-time adjustment, the net profit would have been stronger. The technical impact reduced profit after tax (PAT) by Rs 614 crore, brought down return on assets (ROA) by 15 basis points, and return on equity (ROE) by 1.4 percent. Providing more details, Sharma noted that reported gross slippages for the quarter were Rs 8,200 crore, of which about Rs 2,709 crore was due to the technical impact. This technical impact accounted for 1.03 percent of gross slippages in value terms. If we exclude the technical impact, gross slippages rose by 13 basis points year-on-year and by 20 basis points compared to the previous quarter. Breaking it down further, the technical impact on gross slippages was Rs 2,165 crore from the retail segment, Rs 234 crore from the wholesale segment, and Rs 310 crore from the commercial banking group (CBG). Similarly, on the net slippages side, Rs 1,861 crore was due to the technical impact, making up 0.71 percent of net slippages for the quarter in value terms. After adjusting for the technical impact, the net slippage was Rs 4,192 crore. The reported net slippage ratio, annualised for Q1FY26, was 2.33 percent, but when adjusted for the technical impact, it was 1.62 percent.

"Wealth manager 360 One WAM grows net profit by 16 percent to Rs 285 crore, AUM at Rs 6.64 lakh crore",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/wealth-manager-360-one-wam-grows-profit-by-16-percent-at-rs-285-crore-aum-at-rs-6-64-lakh-crore-13291235.html,"Wealth management firm 360 ONE WAM reported a consolidated net profit growth of 16.8 percent YoY at Rs 285 crore, and a revenue from operations grew by 7.3 percent on year to Rs 911.5 crore, a company filing said on July 17. Margins at 62% were higher QoQ but lower on YoY basis in a quarter marked by recovery in equity markets after initial volatility due to Trump tariffs at the start of April 2025. The Asset Under Management with 360 One was at Rs 6.64 lakh crore, with the ARR AUM rising to Rs 1.95 lakh crore, growing by 38% on year on growth across segments. ARR AUM stands for Annuitized Recurring Revenue Assets Under Management, or the portion of Asset Under Management that generates stable, recurring revenue, usually through advisory or management fees. 360 One said during Q1FY26, the wealth manager onboarded over 200 families with more than Rs 10 crore as ARR AUM, taking the client base for this space to over 4,200, accounting for 95 percent of wealth AUM. Karan Bhagat, MD & CEO, 360 One WAM said, ""This quarter marks a period of strong core momentum and strategic consolidation. While talent continues to remain our biggest bedrock, the recent inorganic initiatives, including the acquisition of B&K Securities and collaboration with UBS, have significantly strengthened our ability to deliver an integrated, full-spectrum platform by combining deep advisory, research, and execution capabilities."" Bhagat added that the foundational levers are now in place for 'sustained growth' that will lead to a 'long-term value creation' for all stakeholders. During the March quarter, 360 ONE WAM and leading global wealth manager UBS AG entered into an exclusive strategic collaboration where clients from both institutions got access to wealth management solutions. Both entities are also exploring opportunities for deep co-operation in asset management and capital markets too. Earlier this year, 360 ONE WAM had acquired Batlivala & Karani Securities in order to grow presence across broking, capital markets, merchant banking, and corporate treasury, along with wealth and alternate asset management. India is one of the fastest-growing wealth markets with 2.83 lakh HNIs with over $5 million in assets, a report by Kotak Private said in 2023, which is expected to rise by 52 percent to 4.30 lakh individuals by 2028."
"HDFC Bank Q1 Preview: NII to grow in single-digit amid slower loan growth, margins may compress",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/hdfc-bank-q1-preview-nii-to-grow-in-single-digits-amid-slower-loan-growth-margins-may-compress-13290731.html,"India's largest private lender HDFC Bank is likely to see single-digit net interest income (NII) and profit growth amid soft loan growth, while margins are expected to remain under pressure due to faster repricing of loans on account of interest rate cuts, said analysts. The bank will report Q1 results on July 19, 2025. According to Moneycontrol's poll, HDFC Bank’s net interest income is likely to rise 7 percent year-on-year, reaching about Rs 31,885 crore in Q1FY26, compared to Rs 29,837 crore in the same period last year. The bank’s profit after tax (PAT) is also projected to grow modestly by 7.4 percent, to approximately Rs 17,385 crore, up from Rs 16,174 crore a year ago.  Estimates of analysts polled by Moneycontrol are shown to be in a narrow range, meaning any positive or negative surprises may elicit a sharp reaction in the stock price. Among the brokerages polled, Kotak Institutional Equities rolled out the most bullish projections while Equirus Research forecasted the slowest growth for HDFC Bank. What factors are driving the earnings? Fast deposit growth, but slower credit offtake: HDFC Bank reported that its average gross advances stood at about Rs 26 lakh crore as of June 30, 2025, showing a growth of roughly 6.7 percent over Rs 24 lakh crore in the year-ago period. Meanwhile, deposits rose more sharply, climbing 16.2 percent to Rs 27.6 lakh crore from Rs 24 lakh crore as of June 30, 2024. Margin compression: Analysts at Kotak believe that the bank’s net interest margin (NIM) is likely to drop by 31 basis points year-on-year, settling at 3.4 percent in Q1FY26 compared to 3.5 percent a year earlier. This is due to quicker loan repricing during the quarter. Higher provisions: Provisions are expected to be higher sequentially, as the bank plans to use the gains from the sale of shares in HDB Financial Services to increase floating provisions. Systematix Institutional Equities noted that HDFC Bank will book a one-time gain of Rs 9,373 crore from HDB’s IPO and may allocate around Rs 6,000 crore for additional prudential provisions. What should investors keep an eye on this quarter? Investors are likely to focus on deposit growth, loan growth, and margin trends to assess the bank’s outlook. During the April-June period, shares of HDFC Bank gained 9 percent, outperforming the benchmark Nifty 50 index, which rose 5 percent during the same time.

Outlook for July 18 Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities: Today, the benchmark indices witnessed profit booking at higher levels. The Nifty ends 101 points lower, while the Sensex was down by 375 points. Among sectors, the Reality index was the top gainer, rallied 1.23 percent, whereas the IT index lost the most, shed 1.50 percent. Technically, after a muted open, the market has been consistently facing selling pressure at higher levels. The Nifty/Sensex has formed a bearish candle on daily charts and a lower top formation on intraday charts, which is largely negative. We are of the view that, as long as the market is trading below 25,200/82,500, the weak sentiment is likely to continue. On the downside, the 50-day SMA (Simple Moving Average) at 25,000/82,000 would be the immediate support level. Below 25,000/82,000, the chances of hitting 24,900-24,850/81,600-81,500 would increase. On the upside, a break above 25,200/82,500 could lead the market to retest the levels of 25,280/82,800. A successful breakout above 25,280/82,800 could push the market up to 25,350-25,425/83,000-83,300. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities Nifty remained mostly under selling pressure throughout the day as the index failed to move beyond the crucial resistance level of 25,260, leading to long unwinding. On the hourly chart, a consolidation breakout is visible, indicating weakening bullish momentum. The current sentiment appears bearish and may drag Nifty towards the 24,920–24,900 zone in the short term. On the higher side, 25,260 is likely to remain a strong resistance.

"Jewellery shares extend gains for a fifth session on value buying: Up to 5% surge in Senco, Titan, Kalyan",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/jewellery-shares-extend-gains-for-a-fifth-session-on-value-buying-up-to-5-surge-in-senco-titan-kalyan-13289244.html,"Shares of jewellery companies extended gains on July 17, supported by value buying and firm gold prices even as the broader market stayed subdued, with Senco Gold, Titan, Kalyan Jewellers and Goldiam International among key gainers higher by up to 6 percent in trade. Analysts said the ongoing rally in jewellery counters was driven by a combination of healthy business updates, optimism around demand during the upcoming wedding and festive season, and steady expansion plans by key players. Senco Gold shares rose 4.76 percent to an intraday high of Rs 372 apiece on the NSE. The stock has gained nearly 10 percent over the past five sessions. Kalyan Jewellers jumped 3.27 percent to Rs 609.50, while Titan Company advanced 1 percent to touch a high of Rs 3,448. Shares of Goldiam International climbed over 6 percent to Rs 363.5. International gold prices too have provided support, with the yellow metal higher by around 26 percent in the first half of 2025, supported by a weaker US dollar, rangebound interest rates and persistent geopolitical uncertainty. According to a recent World Gold Council (WGC) report, gold is expected to stay rangebound in the second half of 2025, with a possible upside of up to 5 percent from current levels. The report also pointed to global GDP remaining below trend and inflation staying above 5 percent, partly due to rising tariffs. A potential rate cut by the US Federal Reserve and continued uncertainty could further sustain demand for gold, the report said.

After a lackluster FY25 in terms of bookings, Q1FY26 has delivered robust booking numbers, helped by a low base and easing concerns over approval delays.

Hold Larsen and Toubro Technology Services; target of Rs 4250: Prabhudas Lilladher,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/hold-larsen-and-toubro-technology-services-target-of-rs-4250-prabhudas-lilladher-13288897.html,"Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Larsen and Toubro Technology Services The revenue growth (-4.2% QoQ CC) was below our estimates (-2.5% QoQ CC), attributed to the SWC seasonality, however ex-India USD revenue grew by 1.5% QoQ. The mobility business (ex-Auto) has stabilized and picked up pace in the off-highway and trucks segments, while Automotive sees incremental pauses and deferrals on executions. The weakness in the Automotive is fairly balanced against the momentum within Sustainability, validated through securing $50m deal within the space. The deal ramp up would support the growth in H2, and even beyond the sizable win ($200m+ LD TCV) the deal pipeline seems to be robust. Given the revenue miss in Q1, the ask-rare translates to ~2.8% CQGR for the rest of the year to achieve low double-digit CC growth. We believe the large deal ramp up and positive SWC seasonality would support growth in H2 to achieve directional milestone. Margins were largely stable despite the notable revenue decline, partly aided by low-margin SWC seasonality and continued momentum in high-margin Sustainability business. We are adjusting our revenue growth against Q1 miss, while keeping our margin estimates largely unchanged. We are building in 9.8%/9.2% CC revenue growth, while keeping EBIT margins unchanged at 13.9%/14.7% for FY26E/FY27E. Outlook We are assigning 29x PE to FY27E EPS, translating a TP of 4,250.

Le Travenues' June quarter revenue rose by 73% on year to Rs 314 crore, while the net profit rose by 27.7% YoY to Rs 18.9 crore. The Gross Transaction Value (GTV) rose to Rs 4,644.66 crore in Q1FY26, growing by 55% YoY. Flight and Bus GTV each grew 81% YoY, and Train GTV rose by 30% YoY for Q1FY26, underpinned by strong domestic travel demand. The Gross Transaction Value (GTV) has clocked a CAGR of 83.7% over the last six years. The management is confident of sustaining a GTV growth of over 40 percent for the full year. ""...we still have significant headroom for growth. But as we scale and category penetration deepens, it’s natural that our growth rates will gradually moderate and align more closely with the long-term category growth rates in our industry. Our job is to extend this phase of outperformance as long as possible,"" Saurabh Devendra Singh, Group CFO, ixigo said. The bus and train segments at ixigo continue to gain traction, with train bookings by Gen Z travellers (aged 18-30) rising 45% YoY on the portal, led by Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Visakhapatnam and Pune as the fastest-growing markets. Bus bookings by Gen Z saw an even sharper growth, rising 56% YoY, the company filing said. CEO and MD Aloke Bajpai said over the next few years, he is confident of grow 'significantly faster than the market' in segments like Hotels, Buses and Flights, and ""in line with the online market’s growth in Trains"". The company's train booking market share has now grown to more than 60 percent. The strong growth has come during a quarter that had seen disruption in flights and airspace closures due to Op Sindoor. The management admitted temporary airspace closures across North India in May was significant, but the post-event recovery has been 'swift', adding that the ecosystem has adapted quickly. ixigo's Director Rajnish Kumar said he is confident of stronger growth in flight business. ""Penetration of air travel in India is still in its early innings compared to global benchmarks, and we see headroom for growth, particularly from regional airports and underserved segments. Just over 4% of Indians travel on flights, compared to 37%+ in China and 85%+ in the US and once the GDP per capita crosses the $400 mark in India we expect discretionary to flow further in flight and hotel categories,"" Kumar said. India’s airport infrastructure, poised for an expansion, will see the number of operational airports double in ten years to over 160 in 2025. ""The government is targeting 200 airports by next year, and 240 airports by 2030, through a Rs 92,000 crore investment push,"" the CFO said, highlighting it as a tailwind for the company."
Reduce Tech Mahindra; target of Rs 1600: Emkay Global Financial,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/reduce-tech-mahindra-target-of-rs-1600-emkay-global-financial-13288870.html,"Emkay Global Financial' research report on Tech Mahindra TechM’s 1Q operating performance was slightly below expectations. Revenue grew 1.0% QoQ to USD1.56bn (down 1.4% CC), marginally missing estimates. With EBITM expanding by 60bps QoQ to 11.1%, TechM logged the 7th quarter of margin expansion, on disciplined execution and benefits accruing from Project Fortius, albeit a tad lower than estimated. Deal intake stayed strong for a 3rd straight quarter, with TCV of USD809mn driving 44% growth in deal intake on TTM basis. Revenue conversion was hit by a challenging macro environment, right-sizing field service business, reduced spending in Auto, and certain client run-offs leading to a slower start in FY26. However, the mgmt expects growth to improve Q2 onward, and certainly from H2, backed by deal wins and pipeline. The mgmt reiterated its 15% EBITM target for FY27, albeit suggesting risk from the prolonged period of an uncertain and tough macro environment. Outlook We cut FY26E-28E EPS by 2.4%-0.1%, factoring in the Q1 performance. Given the rich valuations, we retain REDUCE on TechM with TP of Rs 1,600 at 20x Jun-27E EPS.

Mixed cues from Asian markets and lingering worries over weak Q1 earnings and tariff uncertainties kept sentiment under pressure. At about 9:40 am, the Sensex was down 69.33 points or 0.08 percent at 82,565.15, and the Nifty was down 22.70 points or 0.09 percent at 25,189.35. About 1841 shares advanced, 1053 shares declined, and 175 shares remained unchanged. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Investors are treading a fine line between optimism and caution during the current relief rally, as they closely watch Q1FY26 corporate earnings. With valuations running high, an upgrade in earnings is crucial to justify the premium. Meanwhile, global sentiment remains uncertain, weighed down by ongoing tariff concerns, Vinod Nair of Geojit Investments Limited said. However, India’s macroeconomic outlook remains robust, underpinned by a steady decline in inflation, easing interest rates, a favourable monsoon, and cooling oil prices. The market has drawn support from eight consecutive months of falling inflation, boosting investor confidence. At market open on Thursday, July 17, sectoral indices were trading mixed, reflecting a cautious start to the session. The Nifty Pharma index led the gains, rising 0.71 percent, followed by Nifty Realty and Nifty Metal, which were up 0.66 percent and 0.30 percent, respectively. Consumer durables, FMCG, energy, and auto indices also saw mild gains. On the flip side, selling pressure was visible in banking and IT stocks, with Nifty PSU Bank falling 0.44 percent and Nifty IT down 0.23 percent. India VIX remained steady at 11.22, indicating continued low volatility in the market. Among individual stocks, information and technology player Tech Mahindra Ltd (TechM) shares fell by over a percent after the Mahindra Group company posted its earnings results for the three months ended June 30, 2025. Brokerages remained mixed on their outlook for the firm following strong deal wins during the quarter, while the revenue came in under estimates. Emcure Pharmaceuticals rose 2 percent after it signed a deal with Sanofi India to distribute and promote Sanofi’s oral anti-diabetic drugs, including Amaryl and Cetapin, across India. The collaboration aims to expand access to trusted diabetes therapies through Emcure’s strong national network. As for key levels, Nifty is exhibiting early signs of a potential pullback, with persistent buying interest emerging at lower levels, signalling a tug-of-war between bulls and bears. The index has consistently closed above its previous day’s low, indicating a gradual build-up of momentum and the formation of a strong base near the psychologically significant 25,000 level, which also aligns with the 50% Fibonacci retracement, acting as a crucial support. However, the index continues to oscillate below its immediate hurdle at 25,350. Until a breakout occurs, upward moves may remain capped. Hindalco, Sun Pharma, Apollo Hospitals, Adani Enterprises, and Tata Motors were the top gainers on the Nifty. Laggards on the index included Tech Mahindra, ICICI Bank, HDFC Life Insurance, SBI Life Insurance, and Eternal.

"Brokerages mixed on Tech Mahindra following Q1 show, shares fall; should you buy, sell, or hold shares?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/brokerages-mixed-on-tech-mahindra-following-q1-show-should-you-buy-sell-or-hold-shares-13288046.html,"Information and technology player Tech Mahindra Ltd (TechM) shares fell on Thursday, July 17, after the Mahindra Group company posted its earnings show for the three months ended June 30, 2025. Brokerages remained mixed on their outlook for the firm following strong deal wins during the quarter, while the revenue came in under estimates. Tech Mahindra delivered a strong performance in Q1 FY26, with net profit rising 34 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,141 crore, up from Rs 852 crore a year earlier. The jump in profit came as revenue increased and overall expenses stayed flat. Consolidated revenue grew 3 percent year-on-year to Rs 13,351 crore, while total expenditure edged down slightly to Rs 11,952 crore, aiding margin improvement. However, revenue from the Americas, which contributes nearly half of the company’s total revenue, declined 5.9 percent year-on-year. Net new deal bookings rose to $809 million, up from $798 million in the previous quarter and $534 million in the same period last year. At 9.40 a.m., shares were quoting Rs 1,589.7, down 1.3 percent on the NSE. Should you buy, sell, or hold shares of Tech Mahindra? International brokerage CLSA has an 'outperform' rating with a Rs 2,020 target. The company reported an in-line EBIT, with strong order wins and better margins offsetting slower revenue. CLSA expects growth to pick up from the next quarter, with FY26 revenue likely to surpass FY25. TechM's Q1FY26 is in line with the FY27 strategy, and the management expects above-average growth in FY27, though delays in margin expansion remain a key risk, said HSBC. The brokerage maintained a 'buy' call with a Rs 1,900 target. While the earnings show for the quarter were mixed, the deal wins and pipeline are strong, Nomura noted, expecting better revenue growth in FY26. Nomura has a 'buy' rating on TechM's shares and a Rs 1,810 target price. Jefferies retained an 'underperform' call with a Rs 1,400 target, while Morgan Stanley has an 'underweight' rating with a Rs 1,555 target. The brokerages noted that Q1 revenue missed but profits beat due to higher other income. Order wins were strong, but rich valuations and margin expansion challenges keep its cautious view. The positives for Tech Manhindra are as robust deal wins, stable top clients, and gradual margin improvement. However, concerns remain over weak deal conversion, a challenging manufacturing outlook, and macro headwinds that may impact the balance between growth and margins.

Market mood got a slight lift after Donald Trump ruled out firing US Fed Chair Jerome Powell and hinted at a potential trade deal with India. However, persistent concerns over Q1 earnings and tariff-related uncertainties continue to weigh on investor sentiment. Around 7:40 am, GIFT Nifty was up 0.2 percent at 25,280. Dalal Street saw a choppy session yesterday as Nifty 50 and Sensex recovered from the day's low by the afternoon session of trade, but a lack of buying failed to keep the indices solidly above the flatline. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates On July 16, Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) were net sellers to the tune of Rs 1858 crore worth of shares in Indian equities, while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) net bought Rs 1224 crore worth of shares, according to provisional NSE data. Here are the important levels to watch out for in today's session Nifty index is exhibiting early signs of a potential pullback, with persistent buying interest emerging at lower levels, signalling a tug-of-war between bulls and bears. The index has consistently closed above its previous day’s low, indicating a gradual build-up of momentum and the formation of a strong base near the psychologically significant 25,000 level, which also aligns with the 50% Fibonacci retracement, acting as a crucial support. However, the index continues to oscillate below its immediate hurdle at 25,350. Until a breakout occurs, upward moves may remain capped. ""Nifty Bank index is hinting at a resurgence in bullish sentiment, supported by consistent buying activity from lower levels, with dips being actively absorbed, highlighting underlying strength,"" Dhupesh Dhameja of SAMCO Securities said. ""Encouragingly, the index continues to sustain above its 10-day and 20-day EMAs, both of which are upward sloping, providing cushion at lower zones and reinforcing the bullish undertone. The 57,350–57,400 range has now become a key resistance pocket or supply zone. A clean breakout above 57,350 is essential to signal trend continuation on the upside,"" he added. India VIX declined further by 2.1 percent to settle at 11.24, continuing to hover well below the critical 15-mark. This prolonged low-volatility phase signals that while sellers remain active at higher levels, there is no sense of panic in the market. The muted VIX suggests a controlled consolidation rather than a fear-driven selloff, highlighting a lack of directional conviction. The Put-Call Ratio (PCR) has improved slightly to 0.80 from 0.75, reflecting an uptick in put writing. However, the relatively low PCR still underline a bearish undertone in the market.

At closing bell, the Sensex was up 63.57 points or 0.08 percent at 82,634.48, and the Nifty was up 16.25 points or 0.06 percent at 25,212.05.

Here is how financial markets across the globe fared overnight: GIFT Nifty (Up) The GIFT Nifty is trading higher at around 25,270, indicating a positive start for the day. Asian Equities (Mixed) Asian stocks struggled for direction at the open after US markets had a volatile session amid speculation about the future of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.  US Equities (Gain) Wall Street benchmarks closed modestly higher on Wednesday, with the Nasdaq Composite achieving its latest record finish, despite a chaotic half hour when news reports suggested U.S. President Donald Trump was set to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Shortly before midday, the benchmark S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell more than 1%, while the dollar plunged and Treasury yields rose, after Bloomberg News reported the possibility of replacing Powell, citing an unidentified White House official. Trump's denial revived equity markets, with the Nasdaq Composite closing at 20,730.49, a gain of 52.69 points, or 0.26%. It was the fifth session in six that the technology-heavy index has posted a record high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tab rose 231.49 points, or 0.53%, to 44,254.78, and the S&P 500 gained 19.94 points, or 0.32%, at 6,263.70.

Dollar Index (Flat) The dollar was on a fragile footing on Thursday having lost ground overnight as concerns U.S. President Donald Trump was preparing to fire the Federal Reserve chair shook confidence in U.S. markets.  Asian currencies (Down) Asian currencies were trading mostly lower in the early Thursday trade, with Thai Baht leading the losers followed by Indonesian Rupiah, South Korean Won, Japanese Yen, Malaysian Ringgit, Singapore Dollar, Taiwan Dollar.  Crude (Rises) Oil prices rose in early trade on Thursday, reversing the previous session's losses, buoyed by stronger-than-expected economic data from the world’s top oil consumers and signs of easing trade tensions.  Gold (Gains) Gold steadied after a volatile session on Wednesday as traders assessed the outlook for Jerome Powell’s tenure as Federal Reserve chair after more speculation that President Donald Trump may ax him.  Fund Flow Action The Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) sold equities worth Rs 1,858 crore on July 16. On the other hand, Domestic institutional investors (DIIs) continued their buying on 8th day as they purchased equities worth Rs 1,223 crore on the same day.  Hope you're all set for today's trade.

"Life insurance stocks find D-St favour as regulatory clouds clear, traditional policies gain traction",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/life-insurance-stocks-find-d-st-favour-as-regulatory-clouds-clear-traditional-policies-gain-traction-13284089.html,"The Street has turned more favourable toward life insurance stocks over the past couple of months, as regulatory concerns eased, companies adjusted to new surrender value norms, and shifted focus from equity-linked policies to more traditional products. The June quarter results echoed this trend: HDFC Life delivered a stable performance, while ICICI Prudential’s results were mixed. Still, analysts believe there is room for further re-rating of these stocks in FY26. So far this year, shares of HDFC Life and SBI Life have rallied between 20 and 40 percent, while LIC and ICICI Prudential have seen more modest, flat-to-positive movements. Shrikant Chouhan, head of equity research at Kotak Securities, attributed the mixed trends to differences in product strategies. A diversified product mix helped HDFC Life and SBI Life attract investor interest, while ICICI Prudential lagged due to weak growth in unit-linked products (a portion of the premium goes toward life cover and the rest is invested in equity or debt funds) and challenges in the bancassurance channel. LIC, meanwhile, remains more sensitive to equity market swings and depends heavily on agency-led growth (network of agents who sell insurance policies directly to customers). Nevertheless, Chouhan is optimistic about the FY26 outlook for life insurers, as the base effect from last year fades and non-par and protection products gain traction. “SBI Life remains best placed for further re-rating, while ICICI Prudential offers catch-up potential,” he noted. Nandish Shah, fundamental research analyst at Motilal Oswal Financial Services also shared a positive outlook, expecting better opportunities for life insurance stocks in the second half of FY26. “Growth is expected to recover in H2 as the base from the previous year turns favourable, the impact of surrender regulations is now behind us, and we could also see supportive regulatory actions on the GST front,” Shah said, sharing a ""buy"" rating for HDFC life and ICICI Prudential life with a target price of Rs 910 and Rs 780, respectively. As of now, two players have reported their June quarter results: HDFC Life and ICICI Prudential Life. HDFC Life posted a stable June quarter, with double-digit growth seen in both annualised premium equivalent (APE) and value of new business (VNB). VNB margins also saw steady expansion at 25.1 percent due to renewed focus on traditional products. Going ahead, the management expects second half to be stronger than the first half owing to faster activation of new agencies. In contrast, ICICI Prudential Life reported fall in both APE and VNB growth due to slowdown in ULIP momentum and market volatility. Going ahead, the management believes that increased traction of non-linked products will drive product level margins and will support profitability.  Brokerages in general have also become more bullish compared to last year. All four life insurers saw an increase in the number of ""buy"" recommendations from June 2024 to June 2025. SBI Life retained the highest number of Buy calls, rising from 31 to 35. HDFC Life also gained, with ""buy"" calls increasing from 29 to 31 and no ""sell"" ratings as of June 2025, further improving sentiment. LIC saw a modest improvement, with ""buy"" calls going from 15 to 16 and ""sells"" dropping from 2 to 1. ICICI Prudential Life saw the sharpest jump in ""buy"" calls, from 18 to 23, while ""hold"" recommendations declined slightly. Currently, the valuations reflect this optimism.

Among sectors, the PSU Bank index outperformed, rallying over 1.70 percent, while selective profit booking was observed in Metal and Defense stocks. Technically, a small candle on the daily charts and range-bound intraday activity indicate indecisiveness between the bulls and bears. We believe that 25,100/82,300 will remain act as a key support zone for traders. As long as the market trades above this level, the bullish sentiment is likely to continue. On the higher side, the market could bounce back to the 20-day SMA (Simple Moving Average) or 25,300/83,000. Further upside may also push the market up to 25,450/83,600. Conversely, below 25,100/82,300, the sentiment could change. If the market slips below this level, it could decline toward the 50-day SMA or the 25,000-24,930/82,000-81,800 zone. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The Nifty continues to face resistance at the crucial level of 25,260, which is the 38.20% Fibonacci retracement of the recent decline from 25,669, indicating indecision among investors at the higher level. On the daily chart, the index has been sustaining above the 50-day moving average (50DMA), signifying a positive short-term trend. As long as it remains above 25,000 on a closing basis, the sentiment is likely to stay bullish, with a ""buy on dips"" strategy appearing favourable. On the higher side, a decisive move above 25,260 could trigger a rally towards 25,500 and beyond.

SAT dismisses appeal to restrain the IPO of Smartworks Coworking: ‘Find no good reason’,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sat-dismisses-appeal-to-restrain-the-ipo-of-smartworks-coworking-find-no-good-reason-13285737.html,"The Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) - redressal authority against decisions by market regulator Sebi - has dismissed an appeal by an NGO called Infrastructure Watchdog against Smartworks Coworking - a coworking company - paving the way for its listing on July 17. In a verbal order, SAT said all parties were heard at length and the appeal is ‘dismissed, no costs’. While a detailed ordered is yet to be published, a stay request was made by Infrastructure Watchdog, however, SAT denied it saying, “We find no good reason to stay the order.” After the favourable verdict, the Smartworks Coworking’s IPO can now go ahead, and the management can plan for listing on July 17, as was scheduled earlier. The Rs 583 crore issue had opened on July 10 and closed on July 14. The SAT heard argument by all sides on July 15, and pronounced its verdict on July 16. Infrastructure Watchdog - a non-governmental organisation (NGO) - had moved SAT on July 8 seeking directions to restrain the initial public offering (IPO) process, alleging Smartworks Coworking was a Section 8 company, or charitable and not-for-profit entities. The allegations were that benami funds - where money is from people fronting for others - were used as capital in Smartworks Coworking. Various disclosures related to ongoing proceedings with the Income Tax Department and the Ministry of Corporate Affairs along with a default against Punjab National Bank were not disclosed by the company in its IPO documents, the NGO had alleged. Smartworks Coworking Spaces and its promoters have denied all the allegations made by Infrastructure Watchdog. The company and its promoters argued that the NGO was not even an investor, so its role in the litigation is questionable. Smartworks Coworking Spaces also alleged that the NGO was not independent but was acting as a front for a member of the extended family with whom the promoter group has a long-standing dispute. The NGO’s counsel denied these allegations and cited Sebi laws, under which not only investors but members of the public can raise concerns if any disclosure is not made in the offer document. During the course of arguments, the company informed the tribunal that all disclosures were made and that investors had made a well-informed decision to subscribe to the IPO. Major investors like Tata Mutual Fund, Axis New Opportunities AIF, Aditya Birla Sun Life Insurance Company, Baroda BNP Paribas Mutual Fund, SageOne, SBI General Insurance Company, Trust Mutual Fund, BNP Paribas, and Société Générale were among the 12 institutional investors who participated in the anchor book. The IPO received bids for more than 13.99 crore shares, against the offer size of 1.04 crore shares, according to data on the website of the National Stock Exchange. While non-institutional investors subscribed to their reserved portion 22.78 times, retail investors subscribed to their portion nearly 3.53 times. Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs) subscribed to their reserved portion around 24.41 times.

Buy ICICI Prudential Life Insurance; target of Rs 780: Motilal Oswal,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-icici-prudential-life-insurance-target-of-rs-780-motilal-oswal-13284504.html,"Motilal Oswal's research report on ICICI Prudential Life Insurance ICICI Prudential Life Insurance (IPRU) reported a decline of 5% YoY in new business APE to INR18.6b (in-line) in 1QFY26, largely impacted by the base effect and a slowdown in ULIP momentum due to market volatility. VNB margin for the quarter stood at 24.5% vs. our estimate of 23% (24% in 1QFY25). Absolute VNB declined 3% YoY to INR 4.6b (in-line). For 1QFY26, IPRU reported a 34% YoY increase in shareholder PAT to INR3b (24% beat), driven by robust cost optimization initiatives. Although the base effect may continue to weigh on quarterly growth, management emphasized that its focus remains on achieving robust VNB growth over the medium term. It remains confident about delivering growth over the next nine months, aided by operating leverage and cost efficiencies. Outlook We have kept our APE growth estimates intact for FY26/FY27 but increased our VNB margin estimates by 100bp for both years, considering the VNB performance during 1QFY26.

Buy Trent; target of Rs 6650: Motilal Oswal,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-trent-target-of-rs-6650-motilal-oswal-13284461.html,"Motilal Oswal's research report on Trent Trent reported revenue growth of 40% YoY, aided by footprint expansion (29%/40% YoY store/area additions) and double-digit LFL (SPSF up 4% YoY). Trent added 16/220 net Westside/Zudio stores and consolidated four other format stores to cross 1,000+ stores across its fashion formats. However, Trent’s growth rate moderated in the past few quarters due to high base and contraction in LFL growth to a mid-single digit by 4QFY25. Despite ~70bp contraction in GM, reported/pre-IND AS 116 EBITDA margin expanded ~35bp/105bp YoY, aided by operating leverage, especially on employee and rental costs (2% YoY decline to ~INR179/sqft per month). Trent’s OCF rose to ~INR10b (vs. INR7.8b YoY), driven by strong profitability, while FCF moderated to INR1.9b (vs. INR4b in FY24) due to higher capex. The company also saw an improvement in its return profile in FY25, backed by higher profitability and asset turns. Outlook Adjusting the value of Star and Zara, the stock is trading at 77x Jun’27E PE for the standalone business (vs. ~90x LT average 1-year forward PE). We reiterate our BUY rating.

"Tata Steel, SAIL, other metal shares slump up to a percent, dragging Nifty Metal index as dollar rises on US inflation",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/tata-steel-sail-other-metal-shares-slump-up-to-a-percent-dragging-nifty-metal-index-as-dollar-rises-on-us-inflation-13284288.html,"The shares of metal companies dropped in trade on July 16 as US dollar gained strength on the back of higher inflation in US. The fall in share prices pushed the Nifty Metal index into the red, down as the top sectoral loser in the trading session. The Indian rupee opened 18 paise lower following the dollar strength, as a stronger dollar makes commodities costlier for holders of other currencies. The rise in the US currency came after US inflation data for the month of June hinted at pressures from President Trump's harsh tariffs, which in turn led to lower bets for Federal Reserve's rate cut. US consumer prices rose 0.3 percent in June, implying an annual rate of 3.5 percent. This is higher than the 0.1 percent increase reported in May. Morgan Stanley in its daily market update said US inflation is beginning to show ‘signs of tariff pressure’. Markets have noted tariff inflation effects and appear to ‘seemingly brace for the Fed to remain on hold for longer’, it added. ""The increased uncertainty about tariffs and the extension of the trade talks deadline to 1 August suggest the Fed will need a few more months of data before cutting the policy rate,"" ANZ Bank said. Lower expectations of a rate cut may have also impacted the metal stocks. Jindal Stainless Limited (JSL) shares were the top loser on the index, falling nearly 2 percent to trade at Rs 677 apiece. Steel Authority of India (SAIL) and National Aluminium Company (NALCO) shares were down over 1 percent. Heavyweights Tata Steel and JSW Steel shares fell nearly 1 percent each. Hindalco Industries, APL Apollo Tubes and Vedanta shares were down over 0.5 percent each, while Hindustan Zinc, Jindal Steel & Power and Hindustan Copper shares were trading in the red with marginal losses. Bucking the trend, NMDC shares gained 1 percent. Adani Enterprises and Welspun Corp shares were also trading in the green.

This expansion would strengthen its U.S. presence, enhance service for existing clients, and unlocking new growth opportunities. While volume growth is expected to remain muted until FY27, the company is well-positioned for a strong scale-up once the SEZ and US capacities come onstream. Although management hasn’t disclosed the capex for the US facility, we expect it to be sizeable, given the land parcel is over 5x the total area of existing plants. Development will likely be phased, but the scale adequately supports long-term growth potential. Outlook We retain our BUY rating and raise our target price to Rs 6,400 (earlier Rs 5,200) as we roll forward to Sep’27, applying a higher multiple of 37x (vs. 33x FY27) on back of improvement in growth visibility and resolution of recent growth concerns.

Biocon Biologics gets USFDA nod for rapid-acting insulin,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/biocon-biologics-gets-usfda-nod-for-rapid-acting-insulin-13284140.html,"Biocon Biologics has got the US Food and Drug Administration’s approval for Kirsty, a diabetes medication, paving the way for its launch in the US, a the Biocon subsidiary announced on July 16. Kirsty will be the first and only interchangeable biosimilar to NovoLog (Insulin Aspart) in the US, positioning it as a compelling yet affordable alternative. ""It's a significant step forward in our efforts to make insulin more accessible and affordable,"" said Shreehas Tambe, CEO & Managing Director, Biocon Biologics. It builds on “the foundation we laid with Semgle, reinforcing our commitment to scientific excellence and patient-centric innovation"", he said. A rapid-acting human insulin analog, Kirsty is indicated to improve glycaemic control in both adult and paediatric patients with diabetes. It will be available in both a single-patient-use prefilled pen and a multiple-dose vial, catering to various needs. The FDA's green light for Kirsty significantly expands Biocon Biologics' biosimilar insulin portfolio. It joins Semglee (Insulin Glargine-yfgn Injection), which was the first approved interchangeable biosimilar, solidifying the company's position in the diabetes treatment landscape. Kirsty has been available in Europe and Canada since 2022, indicating a proven track record outside the demanding US market. The company said the approval is a testament to its robust development capabilities, with the decision based on a comprehensive package of analytical, nonclinical, and clinical data. This data confirmed Kirsty is ""highly similar to Novolog"" with ""no clinically meaningful differences"" in terms of safety, efficacy, purity, and potency, it said. The US diabetes market presents a substantial opportunity for Biocon Biologics. With 38.4 million people living with diabetes, representing nearly 11.6 percent of the American population, and sales of Insulin Aspart alone reaching approximately $1.9 billion in 2024, Kirsty is poised to address a significant unmet need for affordable treatment options. At 11.30 am, the Biocon stock was trading at Rs 396 on BSE, rising 1.49 percent from the previous close even as the benchmark Sensex was down 0.18 percent at 82,421.26.

Biosimilar drugs are a type of biological medicine highly similar to already approved products but are not exact copies. They are is almost no difference in terms of safety, effectiveness, and quality compared to the reference product. They offer a cheaper option at the same strength."

Active paid campaigns continued to plateau (+4.3% YoY), moderating from 7.9% in Q1FY25. On the positive side, web traffic was up 6.6% YoY and app downloads per day was up 9.7% YoY. We think this was due to increased advertisement spends. While this is a step in the right direction, we shall look for tangible improvements in paid campaigns over the next 2–3 quarters. Cash balance rose to INR 54.3bn. Collections, in Q1FY26, were INR 2.7bn (flattish YoY). However, the key question on the stock – cash distribution to shareholders – remains unanswered. Without visibility on demand recovery or shareholder payouts, re-rating triggers remain elusive.

Key pressures included: 1) low single-digit growth in branded edible oil (ex-palm), with palm drag leading to ~135bps share loss in value segment; 2) 21.2% YoY volume decline in Food & FMCG, impacted by G2G base and regional rice consolidation; 3) overall profitability was impacted by commodity inflation (+30% YoY). Positive points: 1) supportive policy changes (cut in import duty of crude edible oil) and normalisation of palm oil prices should lead to recovery in edible oil business; 2) branded Basmati saw double-digit growth aided by supply chain improvement, 3) Q-commerce revenue grew ~75% YoY, with alternate channels now contributing over INR 39bn (LTM) – 6% of sales (better profitability than GT). Outlook Our earnings estimates are largely unchanged for FY26-27E; modelling reported revenue / EBITDA CAGR of 8% / -1% over FY25-27E.

"Coffee Day shares hit 10% upper circuit for 2nd day, 20 Microns surges 8% as Dolly Khanna buys stake",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/coffee-day-shares-hit-10-upper-circuit-for-2nd-day-20-microns-surges-8-as-dolly-khanna-buys-stake-13283890.html,"The shares of Coffee Day Enterprises jumped 10 percent to hit the upper circuit for the second consecutive day, while 20 Microns shares rallied 8 percent on July 16. This comes after the latest shareholding patterns showed that veteran investor Dolly Khanna has bought some stake in the two firms. Coffee Day Enterprises shares were locked in the 10 percent upper circuit at Rs 39.86 apiece, while 20 Microns shares were trading at Rs 243 apiece. The well-known Indian investor hails from Chennai and is known for picking small and mid-cap stocks that often become multi-baggers. Her portfolio is managed by her husband Rajiv Khanna. Khanna held 32.78 lakh shares, representing 1.55 percent stake in the parent company of popular chain Café Coffee Day, according to BSE data showing the firm's shareholding pattern as at the end of the April-June quarter. The corresponding shareholding data for 20 Microns, the producer of industrial minerals, showed that Khanna held nearly 7.03 lakh shares representing 1.99 percent stake in the company, as at the end of June. Her name was not present on the shareholding patterns of the two companies at the end of the previous quarter (January-March). This can mean that she bought fresh stake in the two firms during the period. This can also mean that she earlier held less than 1 percent stake in the two firms, which didn't require any disclosures, and bought more shares during the quarter which took her stake higher than 1 percent. The rise in the share prices today came on the back of heavy trading volumes. Nearly 85.26 lakh shares of Coffee Day have been involved in active trade so far, as seen at 11 am. This is nearly 11 times higher than its 10-day average volumes. Around 10 lakh shares of 20 Microns have been traded so far, which is over 8 times higher than its 10-day average volumes. Coffee Day Enterprises shares have now rallied nearly 16 percent in the past five days, and over 46 percent in the past six months. The stock is currently up over 68 percent in 2025 so far. 20 Microns shares meanwhile gained over 1 percent in the past one month, and nearly 7 percent in the past six months. The stock is currently up over 2 percent in 2025 so far.

Shilpa Medicare shares surge 4 percent as key unit gets a VAI classification from US drug regulator,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/shilpa-medicare-shares-surge-4-percent-as-key-unit-gets-a-vai-classification-from-us-drug-regulator-13284002.html,"Leading API and formulations maker Shilpa Medicare's Bengaluru unit has received an Establishment Inspection Report (EIR) from American drug regulator USFDA, with a Voluntary Action Indicated (VAI) classification, implying the company is expected to respond with corrective measures to address the issues, sending the shares higher by over 4 percent on escaping an immediate regulatory action. The inspections were conducted in October last year. ""Shilpa Medicare Limited, Unit VI, Dabaspet, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India has received EIR with VAI (Voluntary Action Indicated) classification, from USFDA, for the GMP inspection which was conducted from October 24 – 30, 2024,"" the company filing said. Shilpa Medicare's facility in Bengaluru is capable of manufacturing, packaging, testing, storage and distribution of two types of complex dosage forms - Oral Dissolving Films and Transdermal Systems, said the company. A transdermal patch is a medicated adhesive patch placed on the skin to deliver a specific dose of medication through the skin and into the bloodstream. These have made their way into the global market as an alternative to conventional, non-invasive, painfree method of administering medicines. Similarly, the oral thin film drugs have high market acceptance due to ease of use and effectiveness. The US and Europe have recorded significant sale of oral thin film drugs. The unit already has several other drug regulators, including Europe, UK, Saudi Arabia and Australia. In February this year, the unit had received certification for Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) from Saudi Arabia's drug regulator SFDA. The same unit is supplying Oral Film products to US and other markets, and Transdermal products to the European market. The management said it is confident of launching a transdermal patch in EU 'sometime in Q4FY26 tentatively or Q1FY27', adding that this is a segment where not many companies are working on it globally. For the Rotigotine patch - used to treat symptoms of Parkinson's disease - the company has projected a global market over EUR 200 million, and has partnered with a 'strong' European player for the segment. On a YTD basis, the shares of Shilpa Medicare are up 15 percent, and over last one year, the share are up 44 percent."
