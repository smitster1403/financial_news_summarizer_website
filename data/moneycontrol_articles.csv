Glenmark shares rally over 2.5 percent on muti-nation Phase 3 trial for cancer drug Envafolimab,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/glenmark-shares-rally-over-2-5-percent-on-starting-a-muti-nation-phase-3-trial-for-cancer-drug-envafolimab-13523737.html,"Pharma major Glenmark has started a multi-country Phase 3 clinical trial for Envafolimab, an oncology drug that is currently being used in China for treatment of tumors, the company said in an exchange filing on September 5, sending the shares higher by over 2.5 percent in a weak market. The drug has a subcutaneous mode of administration, which the company says promises to make immunotherapy more accessible and convenient for patients. An exchange filing by Glenmark said that it has received approval from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) to commence patient enrollment and dosing in India. The pharma company has already submitted a Clinical Trial Application (CTA) in Russia and is preparing to open additional trial sites in Brazil and Mexico to expand the footprint of the study. Envafolimab is a novel anti-PD-L1 inhibitor that is administered subcutaneously, and was invented by Alphamab Oncology, co-developed with 3D Medicines (Beijing) since 2016. Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) comprising approximately 80-85% of cases, and 20-30% diagnosed at Stage III, Glenmark Pharma has said. While surgery remains an option stage III patients, the pharma company cited poor five-year survival rate, making a case for innovative and accessible immunotherapy options like Envafolimab. ""With its novel subcutaneous administration, Envafolimab has the potential to make cutting-edge immunotherapy more accessible and convenient for patients worldwide, especially in regions where healthcare resources are constrained,"" Dr Monika Tandon, Global Head of Clinical Development, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals said. Glenmark had last year stuck a deal to further develop and commercialise Envafolimab in select regions of the world. According to news reports, investment bank HC Wainwright had in 2024 projected a Envafolimab could generate a revenue of $44 million for 2026, which could grow to $176 million by 2029."

"GST Windfall: Where fund managers are buying, where they’re bailing",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/gst-windfall-where-fund-managers-are-buying-where-they-re-bailing-13523490.html,"The sweeping GST 2.0 rate reductions are expected to free up nearly Rs 1.8 trillion in household savings annually, spurring demand across autos, cement, staples, durables and insurance. For fund managers, however, the biggest beneficiaries are precisely the sectors where domestic mutual fund portfolios remain underweight or neutral. Elevated valuations and earlier portfolio repositioning may keep allocations from rising meaningfully in the near term, several fund managers told Moneycontrol. Underweight in key sectors Elara Securities data shows mutual funds are underweight FMCG at -1.4% of AUM, autos are only 0.2–0.3% overweight, and cement 0.1–0.3% overweight. These three are seen as the biggest winners from the GST cuts, but fund managers say sectoral weightages may not rise sharply given steep valuations and the fact that portfolios had already been adjusted last year in anticipation of stronger consumption.  “From a portfolio point of view, it is not just about the uptake but also about valuations and whether further upside is possible. Our approach will remain bottom-up,” said Harsha Upadhyaya, CIO – Equity at Kotak AMC. He added that while tax cuts are positive across the board, demand elasticity will vary by product, making stock selection critical.  Chirag Mehta, CIO at Quantum AMC, agreed allocations will evolve with earnings potential. “Growth dynamics across sectors will change because of the GST cut. That will influence earnings potential, and consequently our portfolio allocations,” he said, adding that the review would be “sector by sector and stock by stock.” He noted that growth in consumer segments has not recovered as expected after income tax cuts earlier this year, so managers will need to see clearer signs of volume growth before deploying money at current valuations. Portfolios already adjusted DSP’s Vinit Sambre said his firm had already rationalized positions last year when capex momentum slowed. “We already have good positioning in these segments — banking, consumer, and some tech-oriented segments — maybe only incremental adjustments, more indirect or proxy plays,” he said. Among investment-oriented sectors, DSP still has exposure largely linked to the power sector, where capex remains strong. ALSO READ: GST 2.0: Beyond blue chips – Watch these under-the-radar movers Overall, Sambre expects a revival in demand across the board. “I believe the automobile sector should see higher price-elasticity-led demand improvement, followed by daily essentials, food and personal care products,” he said. Autos and cement in focus Autos are viewed as the biggest near-term beneficiaries, with GST on two-wheelers, small cars and commercial vehicles cut sharply. Jefferies estimates this could lower on-road prices by 6–8%. Cement, which now attracts 18% GST, is expected to see margin expansion and working capital relief. Durables such as TVs and air-conditioners will also gain from tax relief. In all these sectors, mutual funds are already mildly overweight, but managers say they will wait to see demand pick up and earnings accelerate before increasing exposure further. Mehta said the implications go beyond consumer products. “While the gains are tilted towards consumption, there are broader implications too. Renewable energy will benefit from lower duties, cement duties have been cut which lowers housing input costs, and healthcare demand could rise as health insurance becomes cheaper.” Sambre echoed this, noting that second-order effects will be more critical: “The second-order impact is on credit growth. With consumer demand rising, credit growth should also see a positive impact, and we are already at the lower end of the cycle.” That translates into more bets on banks, apart from stock-specific opportunities across segments, fund managers said. Valuations the sticking point Still, managers caution that valuations remain the decisive factor. “Earnings could improve in the medium to long term, but valuations must still be looked at bottom-up,” Mehta said. Sambre added that much of the news was already in the price. “In fact, on September 4, we saw a negative market reaction, as people were already positioned.” As benefits percolate and consumption trends improve, investors are hoping GST 2.0 will still provide direction to the market.

Asian shares join global rally before US jobs data,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/asian-shares-join-global-rally-before-us-jobs-data-13523071.html,"Asian shares posted early gains Friday after stocks and bonds rallied on Wall Street as further signs of a cooling labor market reinforced bets the Federal Reserve will cut rates this month. Stocks rose in Japan, Australia and South Korea at the open. The Nikkei-225 index rose by more than 1% after President Donald Trump signed an executive order implementing his trade agreement with Japan. The S&P 500 added 0.8% to reach a new peak while the Nasdaq 100 rose 0.9%. Treasuries extended a Thursday rally that saw the policy-sensitive US two-year yield fall three basis points to the lowest in around a year. Money markets are now almost fully pricing in a Fed reduction this month and see at least two by year-end. The action reflected the latest readings on hiring and unemployment claims before Friday’s jobs data, which is expected to extend the weakest stretch of US job growth since the pandemic. Slowing demand, rising costs and Trump’s unpredictable trade policies have cooled hiring, adding pressure on the Fed to shore up the labor market. “Many investors are clearly hoping for rate cuts, but it is important to remember to be careful what we wish for,” said Steve Sosnick at Interactive Brokers. “Data that show a gently decelerating but not dire labor market would suit that goal. Plunging data might bias the Fed to further cuts, but could also raise concerns that the central bank is too far behind the curve.” Elsewhere, Trump signed an executive order Thursday implementing his trade agreement with Japan, under which the US will impose a maximum 15% tariff on most of its products. China’s stock markets will once again be in focus after shares fell more than 2% Thursday. The country’s financial regulators are considering a number of cooling measures for the stock market as they grow concerned about the speed of recent gains. Meanwhile, traders are now positioning themselves for the key jobs reading. Consensus forecasts peg nonfarm payrolls having grown 75,000 in August, which would mark a fourth straight month of job growth below 100,000. The unemployment rate is seen rising to 4.3% — the highest level since 2021. In the run-up to the data, figures showed US jobless claims rose to the highest since June. Private-sector payrolls increased by 54,000, according to ADP Research data, missing estimates. Hiring plans fell to the weakest level for any August on record, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas. “The Federal Reserve’s free pass on the labor market has ended,” said Jamie Cox at Harris Financial Group. “You can expect the Fed to tilt its balance of risks to cut rates in September.” Lackluster employment figures released after the July meeting have prompted greater concern, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell recently signaled a rate cut could be warranted, citing a “shifting balance of risks.” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said in a speech last week that the data support the view that “labor demand may be on the edge of a sharp decline,” a trend he argued monetary policy should address. Waller has been one of the most vocal Fed governors favoring interest-rate cuts to guard against an outright deterioration in the job market. On Wednesday, he suggested the possibility of multiple reductions in borrowing costs by the end of the year. Gold edged higher Friday, while oil extended losses into a third session against the backdrop of concerns OPEC+ may bolster supply at a meeting on Sunday."
"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Afcons Infrastructure, NALCO, IDFC First Bank, Apollo Hospitals, Havells India, Thermax, and others on September 05?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-afcons-infrastructure-nalco-idfc-first-bank-apollo-hospitals-havells-india-thermax-and-others-on-september-05-13523046.html,"Equity benchmark indices saw significant correction from their day's high and closed moderately higher on September 4. The market breadth turned negative after a three-day positive trend. A total of 1,743 shares declined compared to 1,043 rising shares on the NSE. Rangebound trading is expected to continue in the upcoming sessions. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Jay Mehta, Technical Research at JM Financial Services Afcons Infrastructure | CMP: Rs 439.15  Afcons has been moving within a descending triangle pattern since March 2025, reaching a low of approximately Rs 398 after its listing. It retested this level on April 7 and saw a false breakdown below it on July 29, forming a hammer candlestick. The stock has now broken out above the triangle, with a successful retest of the breakout zone. Volume has risen positively in recent sessions and is trading above average. The price trades above its 20-, 50-, and 100-day EMAs, aligning with momentum indicators that support a bullish outlook. The ADX trend indicator shows increasing bullish momentum, with DMI+ well above DMI- and ADX trending upward. A move above Rs 447 could fuel a stronger rally. The stock exhibits notable relative strength compared to Nifty and broader market indices. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 465, Rs 484 Stop-Loss: Rs 411 National Aluminum Company | CMP: Rs 206.67  NALCO this week broke out above a prolonged consolidation range, which was in play for almost 3–4 months, during which trading volume was below average. The breakout is supported by robust volume, surpassing typical levels, and the stock displays strong relative strength compared to Nifty and the broader market. Trend indicators point to sustained bullish momentum in the near term. The price is above all key EMAs, which are converging in a tight range, potentially providing solid support ahead. Daily and weekly momentum indicators reinforce the bullish trend, suggesting continuation. Buying at CMP and also accumulating on dips toward the Rs 192–196 support zone could be a good strategy. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 215, Rs 220 Stop-Loss: Rs 182.5 Devyani International | CMP: Rs 179.3  Devyani this week broke out above a tight consolidation zone, where it had been confined for the past six sessions, marked by multiple Spinning Top candlestick patterns signaling indecision. The bulls ultimately prevailed, and the breakout is supported by a surge in positive volume. In recent sessions, several positive volume surges have also been witnessed, reflecting robust buying interest and good accumulation at lower levels. The stock exhibits strong relative strength, and trend indicators point to sustained bullish momentum. The price is trading above all key EMAs, which are clustering in a tight range to provide solid support. Daily and weekly momentum indicators reinforce a bullish trend, with a move above Rs 182.5 likely to propel further upside. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 195, Rs 206 Stop-Loss: Rs 166.5 Mandar Bhojane, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst at Choice Broking IDFC First Bank | CMP: Rs 72.23  IDFC First Bank has recently broken out of a double bottom pattern on the daily chart, supported by strong trading volumes, indicating the emergence of a potential bullish trend. A sustained move above Rs 73 could open the way for short-term targets of Rs 76 and Rs 83. On the downside, immediate support lies at Rs 70, making it a good level to accumulate on dips. The RSI is currently at 60 and trending higher, reflecting growing buying momentum. For prudent risk management, a stop-loss at Rs 70 is advised to safeguard against unexpected reversals. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 76, Rs 83 Stop-Loss: Rs 67.5 Apollo Hospitals Enterprise | CMP: Rs 7,900  Apollo Hospitals Enterprise has broken out and is currently retesting near a fresh breakout zone on the daily chart, accompanied by a notable rise in trading volumes, indicating strong bullish momentum. A decisive close above Rs 7,950 could open the path toward short-term targets of Rs 8,555. On the downside, immediate support is placed at Rs 7,750, providing attractive buying opportunities on dips. The RSI stands at 64 and is trending upward, confirming strengthening buying interest. For risk management, a stop-loss at Rs 7,580 is recommended to guard against potential reversals. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 8,555 Stop-Loss: Rs 7,580 KEC International | CMP: Rs 861.15  KEC International has broken out and retested its falling trendline on the daily chart, supported by a notable rise in trading volumes. This breakout indicates the possibility of a bullish reversal. A sustained close above Rs 870 could set the stage for short-term targets of Rs 950. On the downside, immediate support is placed at Rs 840, offering attractive buying opportunities on dips. The RSI is currently at 58.35 and trending upward, reflecting strengthening bullish momentum. For prudent risk management, a stop-loss at Rs 819 is advised to protect against unexpected reversals. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 950 Stop-Loss: Rs 819 Om Mehra, Technical Research Analyst at Samco Securities Havells India | CMP: Rs 1,584.70  Havells India extended its recent upward momentum in the latest session after a small pullback. The stock has been consolidating in a broad range over the past few weeks, and the recent up-move has lifted it above all major moving averages, strengthening the short-term trend. The RSI has moved up to 60, entering bullish territory, while the MACD has given a positive crossover and continues in a strong upward trajectory. These signals, along with a series of higher closes in recent sessions, point toward a continuation of strength. The stock has also given a strong breakout from the declining trendline on the daily chart and is now holding above the previous resistance zone, which further supports the positive outlook. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,650 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,530 Thermax | CMP: Rs 3,341.90  Thermax displayed notable strength in the last session, closing above the 20-SMA for the first time in several weeks. This recovery comes after an extended phase of sideways consolidation near the Rs 3,200 base. The momentum indicators are also turning favourable. The RSI has improved to 49, edging closer to the neutral line and indicating that strength is gradually returning to the stock. At the same time, the MACD has generated a positive crossover, supported by green histogram bars. The stock appears to be forming a saucer pattern, which is considered a bullish formation that often precedes a sustained upward move. The rise in volume participation on the hourly chart further adds confirmation. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,550 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,250 Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

"Jane Street’s SAT appeal says Sebi sat on escrow, algo firm’s no-trade conduct out of good faith",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/jane-street-s-sat-appeal-says-sebi-sat-on-escrow-algo-firm-s-no-trade-conduct-out-of-good-faith-13522034.html,"Global trading firm Jane Street in its appeal before the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) has submitted that it deliberately refrained from fresh trades even after regulator Sebi’s restrictions were lifted, underscoring what it described as bona fide conduct, documents seen by Moneycontrol have revealed. The firm, which deposited Rs 4,843.5 crore in an escrow account as directed by Sebi, said its restraint reflected ‘abundant caution’ despite strongly disagreeing with the regulator’s findings. Some market participants have viewed this as a positive gesture from Jane Street, reflecting the firm’s intent to remain in good faith with the regulator and exchanges. In its petition, Jane Street levelled multiple charges against Sebi’s process: 1. Ignoring prior submissions The firm stressed that it had voluntarily explained its trading strategies to Sebi well before the interim order. Representatives of Jane Street entities held multiple calls in August 2024 and presented via video conference on August 20, 2024, giving regulators an overview of its index options strategies and specific explanations of trades on October 18, 2023, and January 17, 2024. Jane Street argued that this information was ignored by the inter-departmental team formed on December 31, 2024, which prepared the order without the benefit of those prior inputs. 2. Lack of regulatory guidance Jane Street said it had repeatedly sought clarity from Sebi and NSE about what constituted ‘large’ delta exposures after being cautioned on its positions. Sebi’s own notes, the firm claimed, showed that NSE had in February 2025 sought guidance from Sebi on this very issue, but no instructions were ever communicated back. The firm maintained that this absence of regulatory direction left its bona fide attempts at compliance unacknowledged. People familiar with regulatory matters suggest that such guidance may not be necessary, as entities are expected to interpret it themselves by analysing trade data and patterns. There are also concerns that, at times, any guidance provided could later be used against them. Also Read: Jane Street challenges SEBI in SAT; hearing on September 8 3. Withholding of key documents Jane Street said several crucial documents, email correspondences, and annexures referenced in Sebi’s internal notes were never shared with it. According to the firm, some of these communications appeared to have been exchanged after reports from NSE and Sebi’s Integrated Surveillance Department (ISD) had initially found no evidence of manipulation. Despite this, Sebi later reversed its stance. Jane Street also complained that Sebi closed the inspection process unilaterally, denying it access to what it described as ‘the most relevant and material documents’. As per Jane Street’s appeal, Sebi claimed these documents and emails as internal communication and denied access. 4. Delay in lifting restrictions Jane Street has alleged intentional delay by Sebi in acknowledging the escrow deposit. The firm argued that the July 3 interim order had provided for an automatic lifting of restrictions once the deposit was made. However, the market regulator allegedly took 10 working days to restore its trading rights, even after receiving Rs 4,843.5 crore in an account marked in its favour. The firm contended this delay caused undue prejudice and undermined procedural fairness. Legal experts had then questioned the unusual delay from Sebi, as the issue was taking much more time than anticipated. Counter view But there are counter views as well. Some of the issues raised by Jane Street may be valid but not all can be relied on completely, said one legal expert. One former regulatory official said investigations are dynamic by nature. “In the course of investigation, there is no pre-conceived line. The direction of investigation changes as new facts emerge. So, questioning why Sebi abandoned the previous report may not be justified.” Also Read: Sebi Chairman urges listed banks to strengthen insider trading compliance, follow two SDD structure Sebi's stance In its July 3 interim order, SEBI alleged Jane Street manipulated index options by exploiting its financial muscle and trading technology to influence prices in both futures and cash markets on expiry days. The order said this resulted in ‘egregious distortion’ of fairness in the securities market, marking a rare case where multiple liquid stocks with high retail participation were allegedly manipulated to benefit index option positions. The case will next be heard by the SAT on September 8. Interestingly the next date scheduled for hearing before SEBI WTM is scheduled for September 15. Jane Street declined to comment on the issue. An email seeking comments from Sebi did not elicit any response."

"Taking Stock: Market fails to cheer GST reforms; Sensex, Nifty off day’s high",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/taking-stock-market-fails-to-cheer-gst-reforms-sensex-nifty-off-day-s-high-13520493.html,"The Indian equity market extended the gains on second day with Nifty finishing above 24,700 led by auto, FMCG and consumption-oriented stocks post Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council announced rate rationalisation. On Wednesday, the GST Council agreed to cut GST slabs to two, 5% and 18%, effectively September 22, eliminating the existing 12% and 28% slabs. On the back of positive global cues and GST reforms, the market opened on strong note but as the day progress indices witnessed profit booking but manages to close in the positive territory. At close, the Sensex was up 150.30 or 0.19 percent at 80,718.01 and the Nifty was up 19.25 points or 0.08 percent at 24,734.30. BSE Midcap and smallcap indices shed 0.6 percent each.

Click to View More Outlook for September 5 Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets witnessed a volatile session and ended marginally higher, supported by sweeping GST reforms that signaled a structural tax overhaul. The Nifty opened on a strong note, led by sharp gains in auto and consumer staples, but profit-taking and weakness in select heavyweights dragged the index lower as the day progressed. Eventually, it closed with modest gains at 24,734.30. Sector-wise, auto, financials, and FMCG led the advance, while IT, energy, and realty were the notable laggards. The broader indices, however, underperformed after the recent upmove, losing over half a percent each. The GST 2.0 reforms strengthen the case for a consumption-led recovery, with auto and consumer staples expected to benefit the most. Select metals and infrastructure names linked to rural stimulus also remain in focus. That said, the broader outlook stays vulnerable to global macro uncertainties, continued FII outflows, and persistent U.S. tariff headwinds. In the near term, consolidation in the benchmark index cannot be ruled out. Hence, we recommend maintaining selective exposure to structurally strong themes while keeping a close eye on the risk–reward equation. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The Nifty pared most of its gains after a gap-up start driven by optimism over GST reforms. The daily close was just below the 21 EMA, indicating a continuation of weakness, although the index appears to be nearing a potential trend reversal. A decisive move above 24,750 could provide the strength needed for the Nifty to move towards 25,000. A sustained move above 25,000 could trigger a further rally. On the other hand, failure to close above 24,750 within the next two to three days may lead to renewed selling pressure on the index.

"Midcap index down nearly 2% from highs as GST cheer fades, three-day rally snaps: Top losers",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/midcap-index-down-nearly-2-from-highs-as-gst-cheer-fades-three-day-rally-snaps-top-losers-13521152.html,"Shares of several broader market names from the small and midcap space fell on September 4 despite an initial cheer following the GST rate cuts, with both Nifty Midcap and Nifty Smallcap indices down nearly 2 percent in the session, underperforming the benchmark Nifty 50 index. Ola Electric shares were the top loser on the midcap index, dropping nearly 8 percent as investors likely booked profits at elevated levels. This comes after the stock rallied around 77 percent in just half a month. Max Financial Services shares fell nearly 4 percent, and Paytm shares fell 3.5 percent amid the buzz of rival PhonePe's initial public offering (IPO). Exide Industries and Cochin Shipyard shares plunged more than 3 percent each. AU Small Finance Bank and Sona BLW Precision Forgings shares fell around 3 percent, while BHEL, UPL, Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL), Kalyan Jewellers and Coforge shares fell around 2 percent each. Other notable midcap losers include Federal Bank, Bharat Dynamics (BDL), Oil India, Premier Energies, Ashok Leyland, NHPC, Voltas, Solar Industries and more. On the smallcap index, defence stocks like Data Patterns, Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers (GRSE) and BEML were the top losers, falling more than 3 percent each, as the pack saw profit booking after a four-day gaining streak. Karur Vysya Bank and IRCON shares fell nearly 3 percent, while NCC, HFCL, ITI, Chambal Fertilisers, Anant Raj, Poonawalla Fincorp, Radico Khaitan, Hindustan Copper, FirstCry-parent Brainbees Solutions, RITES, Sagility India, Welspun Living and others fell nearly 2 percent each. ""Small- and mid-cap stocks corrected today even as GST reforms created a positive backdrop. The key reason was the weekly Sensex expiry, which naturally added volatility and led to some short-term unwinding. In addition, traders booked profits after the strong rally these segments have enjoyed in recent weeks, following the classic ‘sell on good news’ pattern. Structurally, the GST cuts are a strong tailwind for consumption, especially in rural and semi-urban categories, and once the expiry-led volatility fades, the broader market should benefit. This looks more like a healthy pause than a trend reversal, with fundamentals still pointing towards strength in small- and mid-caps,"" said Harshal Dasani, Business Head, INVasset PMS. ""Even as there are robust mutual fund inflows, small- and mid-cap spaces are disappointing—Nifty Midcap 150 has yielded only 0.7% return this year, while Nifty Smallcap 250 has fallen 4.4%, even as the overall Nifty 50 is up by 4.5%. At the same time, Q1 earnings highlight the agony: small-cap margins are at a nine-quarter low of 7.5%, and mid-caps trail further behind with only 1% growth, compared to 9.5% for large caps. The divergence points to lingering valuation issues and institutions' rotation into defensive large-cap sectors,"" said Siddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director, Vibhavangal Anukulakara Pvt. Ltd. ""The downturn seen in small caps and mid caps is a continuation of the correction seen over the last few months, post the euphoric gains seen last year. While the GST gain will help the mid and small caps, the underlying issue in terms of GST filing complications and working capital impact in terms of ITC refunds impacts MSMEs more. These concerns remain. In addition, the global uncertainty and tariffs, which may lead to lower exports especially for companies targeting America, are also impacting sentiment. We expect broader markets to stabilise and might wait for a trigger like an India-US deal to get them moving significantly upwards,"" said Shravan Shetty, Managing Director, Primus Partners.

The company continues to pursue a measured growth strategy, with a sharper focus on secured and prime segments, while effectively leveraging its proprietary underwriting platform, Project Cyclops, to reinforce credit discipline. Outlook We estimate a CAGR of ~22% in loans and ~25% in PAT over FY25-FY27, with consolidated RoA/RoE of 2.7%/~14% by FY27E. LTF will soon emerge out of the MFI credit cycle and will continue to deliver better profitability and RoA expansion. Reiterate BUY with a TP of INR260 (based on 2x Mar’27E BVPS).

Delta Corp shares however plunged 7 percent. During its meeting which concluded on September 3, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council reduced the GST rate on pre-packaged and labelled namkeens, bhujia, mixture, chabena and similar edible items from 12 percent to 5 percent. This will likely spur demand, benefitting these companies. Prataap Snacks shares gained more than 3 percent, while Bikaji Foods and Gopal Snacks shares were up around 2 percent each. ""The sharp, broad-based reduction in the GST rates of most food and key personal care categories could revive consumption partially. Easing commodity prices (tea palm, coffee), good monsoon, favorable base for urban consumption, the recent personal income tax reduction and the upcoming pay commission augur well for FMCG consumption in the next 12-15 months. Lastly, this GST-rate cut would offer some headroom for price increases in the medium term (2HFY27/FY2028),"" said Amit Agarwal, SVP- Fundamental Research, Kotak Securities. Delta Corp shares meanwhile plunged nearly 7 percent. This comes after the GST Council decided to increase the tax levied on admission to casinos, race clubs, any place having casinos or race clubs, or sporting events like the IPL from 28 percent to 40 percent. Delta Corp is India's largest listed casino and gaming company. Hence, the shares of the company tumbled on the GST hike on casinos. The stock has now snapped a two day gaining streak. It earlier sharply fell after government's new online gaming law that has imposed a blanket ban on real-money games.

The GST reduction is expected to provide significant relief to the real estate and infrastructure sectors. Analysts said it could boost demand in the housing segment, as lower construction costs may be passed on to buyers, making homes more affordable. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog The new GST rate will take effect from September 22, 2025, and applies to all major categories of cement, including Portland cement, aluminous cement, slag cement, super sulphate cement, and similar hydraulic cements, whether coloured or in clinker form. These products, previously taxed under the highest 28 percent slab, will now fall under the 18 percent bracket. The reduced tax burden is likely to lead to lower retail cement prices, potentially spurring higher offtake from both retail and institutional buyers. Global brokerage Jefferies described the GST cut on cement as a strong positive for the sector, calling it a long-awaited move that could structurally improve industry dynamics. While Jefferies does not expect a major surge in demand purely from price elasticity, it noted that the new tax regime could aid pricing discipline and support profitability in the medium term. The brokerage also highlighted that companies will now be able to claim full input tax credit on coal—a key raw material—following the increase of GST on coal to 18 percent from 5 percent.

During its meeting which concluded on September 3, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council reduced the GST rate on apparel priced up to Rs 2,500 to 5 percent. Previously, apparel priced up to Rs 1,000 fell under the 5 percent tax bracket, while those beyond that were charged 12 percent GST.

Trent shares jumped more than 3 percent to trade at 5,660 apiece. The stock has gained nearly 7 percent in the past five days, and over 13 percent in the past six months.

The Nifty Auto index rose over 2 percent, emerging as the top-performing sector in early trade, with 14 of its 15 constituents trading in positive territory. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog Saji John, equity research analyst at Geojit BNP Paribas, highlighted that the GST benefits are likely to be broad-based. “Around 64 percent of demand in the passenger vehicle segment comes from small cars, with Maruti Suzuki set to be the largest beneficiary. On the two-wheeler side, motorcycles under 350cc will gain from the tax relief, making Hero MotoCorp a top pick. Commercial vehicles are also expected to see a momentum pickup in the second half of this fiscal, supported by healthy GDP growth and lower taxes,” he said. Under the revised GST structure, small cars—vehicles under four meters in length with petrol engines up to 1,200cc or diesel engines up to 1,500cc—will now attract an 18 percent GST, down from 28–31 percent previously. Large SUVs over four meters will face a 40 percent tax, reduced from 43–50 percent earlier. Electric vehicles remain under the concessional 5 percent GST. Two-wheelers under 350cc will be taxed at 18 percent versus 28 percent earlier, while motorcycles above 350cc are taxed at 40 percent. Commercial vehicles, including trucks, buses, and ambulances, will now attract 18 percent GST, down from 28 percent.

The sharp rise in the share prices pushed the Nifty Auto index up more than 3 percent. The Nifty Auto index was hovering around 26,612.20, the highest level seen in nearly 11 months. During its meeting which concluded on September 3, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council reduced the GST rate on all small cars from 28 percent to 18 percent. This includes petrol, LPG or CNG cars with engine capacity up to 1200 cc and length up to 4000 mm, and diesel cars with engine capacity up to 1500 cc and length up to 4000 mm. The 10-point cut is expected to shave 5-7 percent off ex-showroom prices of popular models such as Maruti Swift, Hyundai i10, Tata Punch and compact SUVs like the Brezza and Venue. While small hybrids that qualify as small cars will also benefit from the 18 percent slab, larger petrol-electric and diesel-electric hybrids have been pushed into the top tax bracket. GST on auto Vehicles with engines above 1200cc (for petrol) or 1500cc (for diesel), or length exceeding four metres, will now attract 40 percent GST, up from 28 percent. Pure EVs remain taxed at just 5 percent, signalling the government's preference for direct EV adoption. However, removal of cess that was previously applicable over and above the GST, is likely to result in marginal relief for premium and luxury vehicles as well as for hybrids. Cess, in the range of 1 percent to 22 percent was earlier charged above the 28 percent GST rate for different class of vehicles. This cess will now no longer be applicable, helping some categories of large vehicles to benefit from this move, despite GST rate moving up to 40 percent. Premium and luxury vehicles remain heavily taxed, with cars and SUVs that fall outside the small car definition continuing in the 40 percent bracket. Motorcycles above 350cc will also face 40 percent GST, up from 28 percent, while two-wheelers up to 350cc, three-wheelers and ambulances will shift to the lower 18 percent rate. Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) shares gained nearly 7 percent to trade at Rs 3,505 apiece, while Eicher Motors, Tata Motors and Maruti Suzuki shares rose more than 2 percent each. TVS Motors, Hero MotoCorp and others meanwhile were up around 1 percent each. Escorts Kubota shares meanwhile rallied nearly 9 percent in early trading hours.

By rationalising slabs and lowering rates on mass categories while taxing sin goods higher, the Council has unlocked volume tailwinds for staples, durables and autos—reshaping equity market leadership in the coming years,"" said Trideep Bhattacharya, President and CIO- Equities Edelweiss MF. ""The GST rate cuts come at the right time which is just ahead of the festive season and against the backdrop of US tariff tiffs. Lower taxes on essentials, FMCG products, autos and cement will leave consumers with more money in hand. This should directly boost demand, help traders and businesses see higher volumes, and may even favourably impact next quarter’s earnings. It also carries the potential to ease inflation. The key will be how quickly companies pass on the benefits to customers and if done well, this move can lift both sentiment and spending,"" said Santosh Meena, Head of Research at Swastika Investmart.

"GST reset fuels demand hopes: M&M, Maruti, Hero Moto, Eicher Motors, Escorts among beneficiaries",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/gst-reset-fuels-demand-hopes-m-m-maruti-hero-moto-escorts-ashok-leyland-among-beneficiaries-13518385.html,"Auto stocks such as Mahindra & Mahindra, Maruti Suzuki India, Hyundai Motor India, Hero MotoCorp, Eicher Motors, Ashok Leyland, and Escorts Kubota are likely to be the biggest beneficiaries of the new GST tax reforms, as sweeping rate cuts have been announced across categories - from hatchbacks and SUVs to tractors and commercial vehicles. Analysts believe the tax relief will trigger a 5 to 10 percent demand surge across multiple segments, setting the stage for a potential re-rating of auto stocks in the medium term. Nomura analysts forecasted volume growth of 3 percent YoY for passenger vehicles and 5 percent YoY for two-wheelers in FY26F, but expect an additional 5 to 10 percent volume uplift following the GST cuts. Shridhar Kallani, auto analyst at Axis Securities, described the decision as “very positive” for the sector. He noted that the small passenger vehicle segment, which has been in prolonged decline over the past 18 to 24 months, may finally be nearing a bottom, while entry-level motorcycles could also be poised for recovery after several quarters of weakness. Passenger vehicles: small cars and SUVs get a boost Under the revised GST structure, small cars - defined as vehicles under four meters in length with petrol engines up to 1,200cc or diesel engines up to 1,500cc will now be taxed at 18 percent, down sharply from 28 to 31 percent earlier. Large SUVs (over four meters) will attract a 40 percent GST rate, compared with 43 to 50 percent previously, while electric vehicles continue under the concessional 5 percent rate. Analysts at Emkay noted that the meaningful reduction in on-road prices is expected to revive sales in the mass-market passenger vehicle segment and re-energise overall demand. Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) emerges as the largest beneficiary, enjoying a 10 percent GST cut across its portfolio. Roughly two-thirds of its models now fall in the 40 percent slab versus 50 percent earlier (including cess), while the remaining portfolio moves to 18 percent from 28 percent. Maruti Suzuki (MSIL) and Hyundai Motor India (HMIL) are also expected to reap sizeable benefits, with blended GST reductions of 7 to 8 percent across their offerings. For both companies, nearly one-third of the portfolio will see a 3 to 5 percent cut, while the other two-thirds enjoy reductions closer to 10 percent. Two-wheelers: fresh spark for under-350cc bikes The new GST rates for two-wheelers lower taxation on motorcycles under 350cc to 18 percent from 28 percent earlier, while those above 350cc are taxed at 40 percent. Kallani of Axis Securities, estimated that the cuts could result in a 7 to 9 percent decline in on-road prices. With two-wheeler volumes still trailing the FY19 peak, analysts believe this tax cut has the potential to trigger a much-needed fresh growth cycle. According to Emkay, the benefits will be broad-based across leading manufacturers. Hero MotoCorp (HMCL) will enjoy a 10 percent cut across 94 percent of its portfolio volumes, while Eicher Motors’ Royal Enfield brand will benefit from a similar 10 percent cut on 81 percent of its models. TVS Motor Company (TVSL) gains from a 10 percent reduction across 70 percent of its range, while Bajaj Auto secures benefits on 49 percent of its portfolio, expanding to 65 percent when three-wheelers are included. Despite the higher GST of 40 percent now levied on models above 350cc, Royal Enfield remains a clear net gainer, with 81 percent of its portfolio benefiting, and only 8 percent adversely impacted by the hike, analysts said. Tractors and CVs join the GST party The GST cut for commercial vehicles, including trucks, buses, and ambulances, to 18 percent from 28 percent earlier, is expected to lower on-road prices by up to 10 percent, according to Kallani. This makes fleet renewal more affordable, encouraging operators to expand capacity. Beyond the direct sales impact, the move could yield wider economic benefits by enhancing goods movement, improving logistics efficiency, and reducing overall transportation costs. Perhaps the most significant, particularly from a rural perspective, is the cut in GST on tractors and agricultural machinery to 5 percent from 12 percent. The steep reduction directly lowers acquisition costs for farmers, thereby enhancing affordability. Kallani highlighted M&M, Escorts (ESC), and VST Tillers as the major beneficiaries in Farm and Equipments space.

Here is how financial markets across the globe fared overnight: GIFT Nifty (Gains) The GIFT Nifty is trading higher at around 24,947, indicating a strong start for the day. Asian Equities (Up) Asian equities were primed to rise Thursday after weak US job openings reinforced bets on a Federal Reserve interest-rate cut, boosting stocks and bonds on Wall Street.  US Equities (Up) Wall Street stocks recovered some ground on Wednesday after technology conglomerate Alphabet rose on a favorable antitrust ruling, but gains were muted as investors digested softer-than-expected labor market data and a selloff in long-term global government bonds. Job openings, a measure of labor demand, dropped 176,000 to 7.181 million by the last day of July, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said in its ""JOLTS"" report on Wednesday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 7.378 million unfilled jobs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.05%, the S&P 500 rose 0.5%, and the Nasdaq Composite added about 1%.  US Bond Yield (Down) The yield on 10-year Treasuries and 2-year Treasuries were trading lower in the early trade on Thursday.  Dollar Index (Flat) The U.S. dollar softened on Thursday in a volatile week as investors contended with bond market jitters while weighing data that showed a weakening labour market, which reinforced expectations the Federal Reserve will cut rates this month.  Asian currencies (Mixed) Asian currencies were trading mixed in the early trade on Thursday. However, on a year-to-date basis, except the Indonesian Rupiah, all other currencies gained between 1-7 percent.  Crude (Down) Oil fell after a report that the OPEC+ alliance will consider a fresh round of production increaseswhen the group meets over the weekend.  Gold (Flat) Gold held near an all-time high after a seven-day rally, as weak US data spurred more bets on aninterest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve this month and mounting concerns over the central bank’s independence underpinned haven demand.  Fund Flow Action The Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) extended their selling on the eighth day as they sold equities worth Rs 1,666 crore on September 03, while Domestic institutional investors (DIIs) continued their selling on the seventh consecutive session as they purchased equities worth Rs 2495 crore on the same day.  Hope you're all set for today's trade. We wish you a profitable day ahead.

Asian stocks rise as weak US jobs fuel Fed bets,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/asian-stocks-to-rise-as-weak-us-jobs-fuel-fed-bets-13518338.html,"Asian equities climbed with Wall Street after weak US job openings data reinforced bets on a Federal Reserve interest-rate cut. Shares in Japan, Australia and South Korea gained at the open. Equity-index futures for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 edged higher after both gauges advanced. Australian bonds tracked Wednesday’s moves in Treasuries, with yields on the 10-year declining almost five basis points to 4.37%. Oil dipped, while gold steadied. With job openings falling to a 10-month low, traders are now almost fully pricing in a September Fed cut and projecting at least two reductions this year. The shift lifted equities, snapping a two-day losing streak for US stocks, and supported Treasuries a day before a pivotal US payrolls report. The data is “another sign that the labour market is slowing down,” wrote Kyle Rodda, a senior market analyst at Capital.com in Melbourne. “The dynamic boosts the case for rate cuts.” Economists project about 75,000 jobs were added in August, based on the median of a Bloomberg survey, while the jobless rate is seen at 4.3%. Four straight months of sub-100,000 payrolls growth would mark the weakest such stretch since the onset of the pandemic in 2020. “A large downside surprise in labor market data could push rates sharply lower given the concern around the Fed’s labor mandate,” said TD Securities strategists including Oscar Munoz and Gennadiy Goldberg. “We remain biased long on dips and expect rates to move lower throughout the year.” Also, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said on CNBC that the central bank should begin lowering rates in September and make multiple cuts in coming months, adding that officials could debate the precise pace of reductions. Investors will also focus on a bond auction in Japan Thursday, which faces added uncertainty from a global debt market turmoil and political instability at home. Meanwhile, borrowers from across the globe are rushing into the bond market, with more than $128 billion of sales so far this week, and investors are lapping up the new debt."
"Markets likely to react positively to GST booster dose for FMCG, auto, insurance, consumer durables and MSMEs, say experts",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/markets-likely-to-react-positively-to-gst-booster-dose-for-fmcg-auto-insurance-consumer-durables-and-msmes-say-experts-13518332.html,"With the government announcing major cuts in GST rates for various sectors including auto, FMCG and consumer durables, the market is expected to react positively to the decisions that many are calling a ‘historic Diwali gift’, say experts. They add that the decision of merging rates into 5% and 18% -- while reserving 40% for sin goods -- will benefit many sectors like FMCG, auto, insurance, consumer durables and MSMEs among others ahead of the festive season. “The new GST regime merges slabs into 5% and 18%, with 40% for luxury goods. Essentials, durables, and insurance see major tax relief. Sectors like FMCG, auto, insurance, and MSMEs will benefit, driving demand, easing compliance, and supporting economic growth ahead of the festive season,” said Ninad Jadhav, Equity Research Analyst, LKP Securities. Also Read: 'Historic Diwali gift' for common man, students, farmers: How new GST reforms will impact you? In a similar context, Vineet Gala, Founder at Xylem PMS, said that the overall package is “very positive."" ""By removing the 12% and 28% slabs, the move reduces ambiguity and aligns India with global best practices,” he said while adding that the sentiment has already turned constructive, with “clear benefits for consumption-driven sectors such as textiles, apparel, footwear and FMCG.” According to him, lower taxes on footwear and clothing up to Rs 2,500 are expected to spur festive demand, while exemptions for senior citizens’ health insurance and cuts on life-saving drugs strengthen the welfare push. Adding a note of caution, Rohit Beri, CEO & CIO at ArthAlpha, said while the dual structure of 5% and 18% is a welcome move, “the devil will be in the detail. The 5% slab usually does not allow input tax credit, so in some cases 12% with ITC was better than 5% without it.” On footwear, he highlighted that raising the concessional limit from ₹1,000 to ₹2,500 effectively extends relief to the “mass affluent” category, potentially giving a broader consumption push. “The council’s assurance of clearing refunds under the inverted duty structure within seven days is another boost. Though businesses will face short-term adjustments around pricing, stock revaluation and compliance, the overall direction is market-friendly, pro-consumption and supportive of long-term growth,” said Gala. Also Read: Big tax reform: GST slabs reduced to two; hundreds of items set to get cheaper from September 22 Among food items, cheese, butter, ghee, oil, confectionary, chocolates, pasta, pastry, cakes, biscuits, coffee, ice cream, jams, drinking water, fruit juice, and beverages containing milk will see a lower GST from September 22. Also Read: From soaps to snacks: GST cut to 5% to boost FMCG demand ahead of festive season Further, GST on several household products has been slashed from higher slabs to just 5%. Hair oil, shampoo, toothpaste, toilet soaps, shaving cream and toothbrushes will now attract 5% down from the earlier 18%. Vikas Gupta, CEO and Chief Investment Strategist at Omniscience Capital, said the footwear and apparel cuts would have a “double impact” on both demand and supply. “Consumers are likely to benefit from lower prices, driving higher volume demand. Exporters impacted by US tariffs can also redirect some supply to the large domestic market, where even marginal increases in demand will be enough to absorb the pressure,” he said. He pointed out that India’s domestic market for footwear, at nearly $30 to 35 billion, dwarfs its $300-500 million US exports. “Similarly, textile exports to the US stand at $10 billion, while the domestic market is around $110 billion, making local absorption feasible,” Gupta said while adding that the government’s commitment to fast-tracking refunds would improve liquidity and sentiment. “It clearly shows determination to mitigate and counter the impact of US tariffs. We should expect more such steps going forward.” Incidentally, the Confederation of Indian Textile Industry (CITI) has welcomed the government’s decision of aligning the GST on MMF fibre and yarn at 5% from 18% and 12% earlier, respectively. “It addresses the long-standing blockage of working capital for thousands of spinners and weavers. With over 70-80% of textile and apparel units in India being MSMEs, this reform will directly benefit a large segment of the industry by easing liquidity pressures, enhancing competitiveness,” said Rakesh Mehra, Chairman, CITI. Also Read: Diwali comes early for auto sector: GST slashed on small cars, 2Ws, 3Ws, CVs Meanwhile, vehicles have also seen major rationalisation. Petrol, diesel and CNG cars in specified categories, earlier taxed at 28%, will now attract 18%. Three-wheelers, motorcycles up to 350cc and commercial vehicles for goods transport as well will come in the 18% bracket. Consumer durables will also see noticeable price drops. Air conditioners, televisions above 32 inches (including LED and LCD), monitors, projectors and dishwashers have all been brought down from 28% to 18%. According to Karthik Mani, Partner - Indirect tax, BDO India, apart from rate rationalisation, the GST Council has also made some important changes in the GST laws to ease the process of obtaining registrations for small businesses supplying through e-commerce platforms and also for quick grant of refunds on provisional basis. “Another important announcement is commencement of filing appeals before the GSTAT by September and commencement of hearing before the end of the calendar year, which resolves a long-standing demand of the taxpayers,” he said.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Coal India, ITC Hotels, GMDC, Pondy Oxides, Paytm, Glenmark Pharma, HDFC Bank, and others on September 04?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-coal-india-itc-hotels-gmdc-pondy-oxides-paytm-glenmark-pharma-hdfc-bank-and-others-on-september-04-13518319.html,"The benchmark indices rebounded after a day of profit booking, rising more than half a percent on September 3. Bulls continued to support the market breadth for the third straight day, with about 1,884 shares advancing compared to 894 declining shares on the NSE. The uptrend is expected to strengthen if the frontline indices decisively surpass short- and medium-term moving averages. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Nilesh Jain, Head- Equity Technical & Derivative Research at Centrum Broking ITC Hotels | CMP: Rs 250.65  ITC Hotels has broken out of a symmetrical triangle pattern on the daily chart, indicating a potential trend continuation. A decisive break above Rs 255 could trigger a fresh rally towards new all-time highs. In the short term, we expect the stock to surpass resistance and move towards the Rs 270 level, supported by strong momentum post-breakout. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 270 Stop-Loss: Rs 241 Coal India | CMP: Rs 389.8  Coal India has formed a strong base and recently broke out from a falling trendline, supported by higher-than-average volumes, indicating strong buying interest. It is now trading comfortably above all key short-term and long-term moving averages, reflecting underlying strength in the trend. Furthermore, momentum indicators and oscillators on the daily chart have confirmed a bullish crossover, adding conviction to the bullish setup. Based on this technical structure, we anticipate the stock to move towards Rs 410 in the near term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 410 Stop-Loss: Rs 378 GMDC | CMP: 459.7  Gujarat Mineral Development Corporation has broken out of a symmetrical triangle pattern on the daily chart, suggesting a continuation of the uptrend. The breakout was supported by strong volume participation, indicating solid underlying strength in the stock. The pattern-based target is projected around Rs 501, with immediate support at Rs 440. Given these technical factors, the stock is likely to maintain its positive momentum in the short term, and a buy-on-dips approach is recommended. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 501 Stop-Loss: Rs 440 Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical Research and Derivatives at SBI Securities Jindal Steel and Power | CMP: Rs 1,028.35  Jindal Steel has been moving in a Rs 1,022–942 range since the start of August. The stock broke out of the range and gave a horizontal trendline breakout on Wednesday. The breakout was also supported by robust volumes. On September 1, the stock formed a piercing line candlestick pattern around its 100-day EMA and rose sharply since then. Momentum indicators are also supporting the bullish narrative. The daily RSI crossed the 60 mark, and its upward trajectory reflects improving strength in price action. On the other hand, ADX—a key trend strength indicator—shows DI+ crossing above DI-, reinforcing the bullish outlook. This confluence of price breakout, volume confirmation, and supportive trend and momentum indicators suggests that Jindal Steel is poised for further upside in the near term. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 1,025–1,035 levels. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,100 Stop-Loss: Rs 999 Pondy Oxides & Chemicals | CMP: Rs 1,165.5  Pondy Oxides marked a high of Rs 1,209 on July 31 and thereafter witnessed a throwback. During this period, volume activity was mostly below average. The stock tested its 34-day EMA multiple times, found support, and formed a strong base, suggesting accumulation at lower levels. On Wednesday, the stock gave a symmetrical triangle pattern breakout along with robust volume. It is now trading above its key moving averages, which reinforces the bullish undertone. The RSI is firmly positioned in the bullish zone, inching towards the 60 mark, reflecting improving price strength. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 1,160–1,170 levels. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,250 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,130 One 97 Communications | CMP: Rs 1,288.3  Paytm has been moving in a higher high, higher low formation on the daily chart, indicating that the stock is in a strong uptrend. It managed to hold on to its short-term key moving average—the 20-day EMA—during the recent consolidation phase and moved up steadily, reflecting strong bullish sentiment. The Paytm/Nifty ratio chart has given a major horizontal trendline breakout and is at a fresh high, indicating likely outperformance in the short term. Adding to the positive setup, the daily RSI is in bullish territory and continues to rise, reflecting strong bullish momentum. On the derivative front, all the strikes from Rs 1,200 to Rs 1,260 saw Call writers exiting (bears exiting) and strong Put writing (bulls entry), supporting the bullish outlook. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 1,285–1,295 levels. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,390 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,255 Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities Glenmark Pharma | CMP: Rs 2,004.4  Glenmark Pharmaceuticals has witnessed a smart recovery following a base formation on the daily timeframe, pointing towards a significant improvement in interest around the stock. Lately, the stock has reclaimed the 21 EMA on the daily timeframe, confirming a bullish trend. The RSI is seen to be reversing near the oversold zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,240 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,900 EIH | CMP: Rs 412.5  EIH has ended its downward trend, confirmed by a wedge pattern breakout on the weekly chart. Moreover, it has been sustaining above its recent consolidation range. The RSI has also broken out of a symmetrical triangle, indicating improving sentiment. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 450 Stop-Loss: Rs 394 HDFC Bank | CMP: Rs 954.5  HDFC Bank has shown initial signs of recovery by forming an outside day bar on the daily timeframe. On the hourly chart, it has reclaimed the 21 EMA, accompanied by rising volumes. Additionally, the RSI has formed a positive divergence on the hourly timeframe, supporting a potential upside move.

The Economic Times had reported that these shareholders have reached out competitors like Haldiram, Advent-backed DFM Foods and ITC, as well as private equity funds to gauge their interest in buying out a controlling stake in Prataap Snacks or exploring a merger. Prataap Snacks later issued a clarification, strongly denying the claims. ""The contents are speculative in nature and not based on facts. Neither the Company nor its Promoters, including Authum Investment and Infrastructure Limited, are exploring any exit options,"" it said in an exchange filing. ""Further, the Company continues to pursue its business growth strategy with a focus on distribution expansion, product innovation, and profitability improvement. Our Promoters remain fully committed to the business and are confident in the strength of our brands and wide distribution footprint,"" it added. This comes months after the shareholders had bought nearly half the Indore-based snacks-maker from Peak XV Partners (formerly Sequoia Capital). In September 2024, Authum Investment and Mahi Madhusudan Kela acquired 46.85 percent controlling stake in snack food company in Prataap Snacks for Rs 846.60 crore. According to data on the company's latest shareholding pattern, Authum owned 42.93 percent stake in the company as at the end of the April-June quarter of the ongoing financial year.

The year has seen over 100 SME IPOs with an anchor book portion, and top five investors featured in more than 20 percent of the public issues, with the top three names cornering nearly 30 percent of the anchor allocation, showed Prime Database. Institutional investors such as Vikasa Capital, Rajasthan Global Securities, Saint Capital Fund, Aarth AIF Growth Fund, and NAV Capital VCC-NAV Capital Emerging Star Fund have been placing big bets on SME IPOs, having had share in anchor allocation in around 20 percent of the issues launched in 2025. Both Vikasa Capital and Rajasthan Global Securities cornered more than 30 percent each of the total anchor allotment by SME IPOs so far this year till August 31. Saint Capital Fund too was in the same league, with the quantum of allotment at a little over 28 percent.  The cumulative size of anchor allotment in 106 SME IPOs so far this year was pegged at nearly Rs 1,522 crore. Meanwhile, in terms of the number of issues where these investors managed allotment, Vikasa leads the list with 34 SME IPOs, followed by Rajasthan Global Securities at 32, and Saint Capital Fund at 30. These three investors featured in the anchor book of nearly 30 percent of the SME IPOs that hit the market this calendar year. A bunch of 15-20 SME IPOs this year saw participation from several institutional investors such as Viney Growth Fund, Craft, Beacon Stone Capital, Innovative Vision Fund, Ashika Global Securities and Steptrade Revolution Fund, among others, as per data from Prime Database. The SME IPO arena has been attracting a lot of attention – from the regulator too - due to factors such as abnormally high subscription and huge listing gains followed by a significant price correction. In recent past, regulatory officials have highlighted that only a select set of investors were typically allotted shares in the anchor book of SME IPOs. Capital market regulator Sebi along with BSE and NSE have tightened the norms for SME IPOs in recent months."

Kalyan Jewellers shares rise 2% after report says Warburg eyes Rs 850-crore stake in Candere,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/kalyan-jewellers-shares-rise-2-after-report-says-warburg-eyes-rs-850-crore-stake-in-candere-13515947.html,"The shares of Kalyan Jewellers gained more than 2 percent on September 3 after a report said that international private equity firm Warburg Pincus is in discussions with the jewellery-maker to buy some stake in its lifestyle brand Candere. Warburg Pincus is eyeing 10 percent stake in Candere for Rs 800-850 crore, the Economic Times reported citing people familiar with the matter. The New York-based company will likely purchase part of this stake from Kalyan Jewellers, while the rest will be newly issued shares in Candere, the report added. Candere will use the proceeds from the issue of new shares to expand its presence, it further said. Moneycontrol couldn't independently verify the report. Notably, Warburg Pincus had remained an investor in Kalyan Jewellers since 2014 before fully exiting the company last year. In August 2024, Warburg Pincus sold its last 9.17 percent stake to institutional investors and TS Kalyanaraman - the promoter of the jewellery chain. For the April-June quarter of the financial year 2026, Kalyan Jewellers reported a revenue of Rs 66 crore and a net loss of Rs 10 crore for Candere, which was founded in 2013. The lifestyle brand's number of showrooms stood at 81 at the end of the quarter. Kalyan Jewellers shares later pared some gains to trade 0.6 percent higher at Rs 511.75 apiece. The stock currently has a P/E ratio of around 66.

The bitter truth about sugar stocks: Why the ethanol induced rally may not last,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/the-bitter-truth-about-sugar-stocks-why-the-ethanol-induced-rally-may-not-last-13515951.html,"Sugar stocks were on a tear after New Delhi sweetened its ethanol blending roadmap, sending shares of Balrampur Chini, Shree Renuka Sugars, Dhampur Sugar, and others higher in recent sessions. But the rally may soon lose steam, analysts warn, as India’s chronic production shortfalls and flat ethanol prices could limit mills’ incentive to divert cane away from sugar, undermining the bullish narrative. Yesterday, the Supreme Court upheld the rollout of 20 percent ethanol-blended petrol, supporting the government’s roadmap, while the Centre removed all restrictions on producing ethanol from sugarcane juice, syrup, B-heavy, and C-heavy molasses for the 2025–26 marketing year. On paper, it looks like a win-win—more cane, more ethanol, more profits. In reality, the sweetness is tempered by structural challenges. The bitter truth Analysts at InCred Capital highlighted that sugar production forecasts rarely match reality. Every year, estimates start sweet but end up disappointing. Forecasts keep inflating, but outcomes collapse like a May heatwave—loud, sweaty, and brutally honest. In 2023–24, output was projected at 34 million metric tonne (MMT), but the final number was closer to 29.5 MMT. For 2024–25, the estimate has already been cut from 35.5 MMT to 28 MMT. The new 35.25 MMT forecast for 2025–26 could face the same fate if rains disappoint or recovery rates dip. ALSO READ: Does the liberal ethanol feedstock policy really boost sugar mills’ earnings prospects? The brokerage firm maintained a ""reduce"" rating on sugar-based players such as Balrampur Chini and Triveni Engineering, citing policy headwinds, while recommending an “add” rating on grain-based distilleries like BCL Industries, Gulshan Polyols, and Globus Spirits. While sugar production woes are just the tip of the iceberg, the detail lies in the devil, wherein mills don't prefer ethanol diversion over selling retail sugar. With India on track to hit its 20 percent blending target in CY25, sugar’s share in ethanol supply is shrinking because of poor margins. Of the 7.23 billion litres supplied till July in Ethanol Supply Year 2025 (ESY25), only 38 percent came from sugar, with the remaining 62 percent were sourced from grains like rice and maize. The reason is simple: ethanol made from cane juice or B-heavy molasses is less profitable. Ethanol diversion losing its sweetness Analysts at JM Financial underlined the problem in pricing. For example, in 2024–25, the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) of cane jumped to Rs 3,400 per quintal from Rs 3,050 in 2022–23. However, ethanol prices from B-heavy (Rs 60.73/litre) and juice (Rs 65.61/litre) haven’t been revised for over two years. With an average yield of 22 litres of ethanol per quintal of cane, revenue works out to roughly Rs 1,450, far below the FRP, resulting in negative margins. By contrast, sugar prices in India have remained stable to strong (Rs 36–38/kg wholesale in 2024–25). Selling sugar directly at Rs 38.20/kg generates Rs 3,820 per quintal, substantially higher than ethanol revenues, making sugar sales the preferred route for mills despite policy incentives. While government policies create an alternative revenue stream through ethanol blending, the current pricing structure does not make it financially compelling compared to traditional sugar sales. With sugar production expected to rise and closing balances projected at 7–8 MMT for Sugar Season 2026 (SS26), analysts suggested the government could permit higher sugar exports, as sugar supply will likely absorb any incremental ethanol diversion. So far this year, sugar stocks have delivered mixed results: Shree Renuka Sugars, Dhampur Sugar, and Dwarikesh Sugar have dropped up to 30 percent, whereas Balrampur Chini and EID Parry have risen as much as 22 percent.

"Hotel, footwear stocks rise up to 3% as investors hope for GST relief",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/hotel-footwear-stocks-rise-up-to-3-as-investors-hope-for-gst-relief-13515693.html,"Shares of hotel and footwear companies surged on September 3 as investors pinned hopes that the GST Council may reduce tax levied on some services and items falling from these two categories. The GST Council, chaired by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, is meeting in New Delhi on September 3-4 to deliberate on the Centre's proposal for a simplified rate structure of 5 percent and 18 percent. For footwear, it is being reported that GST on items priced above Rs 2,500 is likely to be increased to 18 percent from 12 percent, however, items below Rs 2,500 may see GST reduced to 5 percent from the existing 12 percent. Relaxo Footwears shares are higher by 3 percent while Campus Activewear shares are up nearly 1.5 percent. Khadim India shares gained more than a percent while Red Tape shares jumped around 2 percent. Currently, GST rate on hotel rooms is fixed at 12 percent for room tariffs up to Rs 7,500 per night, and 18 percent for room tariffs exceeding Rs 7,500 per night. The GST Council is set to deliberate upon simplification of the tax structure, and removal of the 12 percent GST slab. Hotel companies with room rates mostly below Rs 7,500 per night saw their shares rise sharply, ahead of the outcome of the GST meet outcome. ITC Hotels shares jumped nearly 2 percent to trade at Rs 252 apiece, while Lemon Tree Hotels and Chalet Hotels shares rose more than 2 percent each. EIH and Samhi Hotels shares surged more than 3 percent each. IHCL shares rose nearly 2 percent. Puneet Chhatwal, MD & CEO of Indian Hotels Company, told CNBC-TV18 recently that a revision in GST rates could be a major boost for the hospitality sector.

The transaction positions it to scale up its wellness range globally, a strategic step toward building a diversified, consumer-focused beauty, health & wellness portfolio.

EBITDA decreased by 1.3% YoY (+3.5% QoQ) to INR 5,805 Mn., stood sharply below our estimates, led by poor operating leverage on account of miss in revenue and higher operating expenses. Adj. net profit increased by 8.8% YoY (-2.0% QoQ) to INR 3,701 Mn., stood sharply below our estimates, led by poor operational performance. Gross margin expanded by 311bps YoY (+233bps QoQ) to 68.9%, led by improved product mix from branded markets, discontinuation of low-margin tail-end brands, and stronger contributions from high-value therapies. EBITDA margin contracted by 35bps YoY (+55bps QoQ) to 17.8%, impacted by higher R&D spend, one-off severance and plant-related costs, along with higher operating expenses on account of new launches, offset by gains in gross margin.

Buy ICICI Bank; target of Rs 1700: Emkay Global Financial,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-icici-bank-target-of-rs-1700-emkay-global-financial-13515562.html,"Emkay Global Financial' research report on ICICI Bank ICICIB reported some moderation in credit growth at ~12% YoY in 1Q, mainly due to slower growth in retail loans (incl mortgages and unsecured loans) and demand remaining slack in the corporate portfolio. That said, better yielding SME (reclassified) has been a key growth driver for the bank (up 30% YoY) and now contributes nearly 20.5% of its loan portfolio (nearly the same as the corporate portfolio size). The management highlighted that the bank’s SME portfolio is skewed toward high-ticket loans which, hence, does not pose much risk to asset quality for now, although the bank may face some growth pressure amid the ongoing trade war. ICICIB has lost market share in home loans due to higher pricing; however, it has realigned pricing in line with peers (Exhibit 15) which should help partly offset the expected growth normalization in SME. Overall, loan growth is expected to remain soft through FY26, prompting a cut of 70bps in our growth estimate to around 11.5% (though still better ex-Kotak). So far, it has shown margin resiliency vs peers which may contract amid the ongoing rate cut cycle, though it may continue to outperform peers given its better portfolio mix (asset/liability). Outlook Notwithstanding the near-term margin pressure across banks, as also for ICICIB (though lower), we believe the bank is well positioned to deliver peer-best RoA of 2.1-2.3% over FY26-28E, aided by better cost management, core fees, and contained LLP. This, coupled with credible top management, leadership pool, digital banking edge, and asset quality resiliency, should help the bank command premium valuations versus large-cap PVBs. Thus, we retain BUY while revising up our TP by 6% to Rs1,700 (from Rs1,600), rolling forward on 2.6x Sep-27E ABV and subs valuation at Rs270/sh.

"Metal stocks jump for 3rd day on weaker dollar, other key factors: Tata Steel, Hindustan Copper, others rally up to 6%",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/metal-stocks-jump-for-3rd-day-on-weaker-dollar-other-key-factors-tata-steel-hindustan-copper-others-rise-up-to-3-13515335.html,"Shares of metal companies were sharply higher on September 3, extending gains on weaker dollar and taking the Nifty Metal index higher by more than 3 percent to extend gains for a third session. Tata Steel shares are the top gainers on the index, rising nearly 6 percent, while SAIL and Jindal Steel & Power shares jumped more than 5 percent each. Hindustan Copper shares rose nearly 5 percent. Welspun Corp and Hindalco Industries shares jumped over 3 percent each, while JSW Steel shares rose nearly 3 percent. NMDC and Vedanta shares were up around 2 percent each, while Hindustan Zinc and shares were up around 1 percent. Here are some key factors driving the stocks higher: Weaker Dollar The US dollar has seen recent weakness after one report by DBS said, quoted by Reuters said that Trump's appointments to the Fed are likely to further weigh on the dollar. ""Already, the labour market is softening, and Chair Powell has signalled the possibility of rate cuts at Jackson Hole,"" the note said. ""This means that the overvalued USD could ease again as markets anticipate coming Fed rate cuts."" A weaker dollar improves global demand for commodities, like metals, which in turn benefits Indian metal companies through higher export opportunities and better pricing. China's Plan to Cut Steel Output China has plans to cut steel production between 2025 and 2026, according to an official document reviewed by Reuters, in an effort to tackle overcapacity. A reduced steel output from China will likely lower dumping of cheap metals into the Indian market, which in turn could benefit Indian metal players. CLSA said it expects the spreads to improve and Indian mills to see a rise in their profitability, according to the note cited by CNBC-TV18. CLSA tweaked FY26-28 EBITDA estimates for metals and mining companies under its coverage by -4 percent to +8 percent. It noted that it continues to favour aluminium, given tighter demand-supply balance. GST Reform Hopes The GST Council, chaired by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, is meeting in New Delhi on September 3-4 to deliberate on the Centre's proposal for a simplified two-rate structure of 5 percent and 18 percent. ""GST reforms and rate cuts together can spur growth by lowering compliance costs, improving efficiency, and boosting affordability. Reduced GST on housing or construction inputs supports real estate demand, while cheaper financing from rate cuts aids both homebuyers and capital-intensive industries like metals,"" said Pranay Aggarwal, Director and CEO of Stoxkart. US Fed Rate Cut Hopes US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on August 22 had said that a weaker job market may soon force the American central bank to cut interest rates. ""Downside risks to employment are rising,"" according to Powell's remarks at the Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium, last month. Most investors now expect a 25 bps Fed rate cut during its upcoming meeting on September 16-17. A rate cut in the US could reduce borrowing costs for foreign investors, encouraging them to invest in higher growth markets such as India, potentially boosting metal stocks. Also Read: Our LIVE blog on stock market updates Strong Q1 GDP Indian economy grew 7.8 percent in the June quarter, beating RBI's 6.5 percent projection and the 6.6 percent median recorded in a Moneycontrol poll. A stronger GDP growth may spur confidence in Indian economy's growth, which in turn can boost the metal stocks. “While domestic demand remains subdued, the market is pinning its hope on post-monsoon recovery, government capex, and GST recalibration. Recent developments would lead to a tighter pricing range, adding duration to earnings and potentially boosting valuation,” said Emkay Global while noting that its key picks in the sector are Tata Steel and SAIL. MOIL, which is not part of the metal index, saw its share price rise by nearly 5 percent. This came after the company reported its best-ever August production with 17 percent growth on-year to 1.45 lakh tonnes. “On the sales front, the company also delivered strongly with 1.13 lakh tonnes of sales in August 2025, reflecting a remarkable 25.6% growth year-on-year. Further, during April–August 2025, MOIL recorded its best-ever performance with 7.92 lakh tonnes of production (up 9.3% y-o-y) and 50,621 meters of exploratory drilling (up 8.6% y-o-y),” it added.

Star experienced a rise in group segment’s loss ratio from 78% in Q1FY25 to 85.1% in Q1FY26. 3) Benefit of repricing undertaken in 60-65% of the portfolio in mid-FY25 along with calibrated annual repricing strategy. 4) Higher equity AUM with mix increasing from 6.7% in Mar’24 to 15% in Mar’25 and 17.5% in Jun’25. 5) Various digital initiatives could improve efficiency with EOM at 32.6% in Q1FY26 (calculated).

Yes Bank shares gain 2% as CCI clears Sumitomo Mitsui’s 25% stake acquisition,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/yes-bank-shares-gain-2-as-cci-clears-sumitomo-mitsui-s-25-stake-acquisition-13515190.html,"Shares of Yes Bank jumped 2 percent to Rs 20 on September 3 after the Competition Commission of India (CCI) cleared Japan’s Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation’s (SMBC) proposal to acquire up to 24.99 percent stake in the private lender. “The proposed combination relates to the acquisition of share capital and voting rights of Yes Bank by Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation,” the CCI said in its release. SMBC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (SMFG), Japan’s second-largest banking group with total assets of $2 trillion as of December 2024 and a significant global presence. This approval comes close on the heels of the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) nod last month for SMBC’s plan to acquire up to 24.99 percent of Yes Bank’s paid-up capital and voting rights. The transaction traces back to Yes Bank’s May 9, 2025, disclosure that SMBC would purchase a 20 percent stake via a secondary deal, comprising 13.19 percent from State Bank of India (SBI) and 6.81 percent collectively from seven other banks including Axis Bank, Bandhan Bank, Federal Bank, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, IDFC First Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank. Following this deal, SMBC will emerge as the single-largest shareholder in Yes Bank. Separately, the RBI has also approved the re-appointment of Rama Subramaniam Gandhi as part-time Chairman of Yes Bank from September 20, 2025, until May 13, 2027. Gandhi, a seasoned central banker with 37 years of service, earlier served as RBI Deputy Governor between 2014 and 2017.

"Indus Towers sinks 4% on foray into African markets, dividend concerns weigh",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/indus-towers-shares-in-focus-on-foray-into-african-markets-brokerages-remain-bullish-13514718.html,"Shares of telecommunications company Indus Towers Ltd sank four percent in trade on Wednesday, September 3, after the firm's board gave its nod for a foray into the African markets, which will mark the first-ever overseas expansion of Indus Towers. The company has received approval to foray in African markets, beginning with Nigeria, Uganda, and Zambia as these markets offer attractive prospects for revenue diversification, operational scalability, and long-term value creation, the firm said in a statement. ""Indus Towers will leverage its robust financial position and anchor customer relationship with Bharti Airtel to establish a strong and competitive presence in these regions. As part of its broader growth strategy, the company will continue to evaluate expansion opportunities in other African markets where Airtel has an established presence,"" the statement said. Brokerages reaffirmed their bullishness, highlighting Indus Towers' attractive valuations. Citi maintained a buy rating on Indus Towers with a target price of Rs 460, noting that investor concerns over delayed payouts, Vi’s financial health, and Bharti’s slower rollouts are overstated. The brokerage highlighted the potential for medium-term growth, strong free cash flow generation, and moderating capex intensity, which could support higher shareholder returns. Citi added that valuations remain attractive versus peers, with its bear-case scenario indicating limited downside risk. CLSA retained its high conviction outperform call on Indus Towers with a target of Rs 520, pointing to the board’s approval for an international foray beginning with Nigeria, Uganda, and Zambia. However, with fewer than 500 towers in these markets, revenue diversification is expected to remain limited. Instead, the brokerage expects management to prioritize capital structure improvement through higher dividends. CLSA flagged the ongoing delay in distributions as unjustified despite the board’s commitment to reinstating payouts. Indus Towers has not declared any dividend since May 2022, citing pending dues from its major client Vodafone Idea. Earlier this year, the company was expected to consider a bonus issue, share buyback, or both at its May board meeting. However, the meeting was postponed, which weighed on investor sentiment and pulled the stock lower. At 9.18 a.m., shares were quoting Rs 315.95, lower by 4.1 percent on the NSE compared to the previous session's closing price.

Asian stocks poised to track Wall Street declines,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/asian-stocks-poised-to-track-wall-street-declines-13514178.html,"Asian stocks were poised to mirror a weak US session, where equities fell alongside bonds amid a rush of corporate-debt sales and worries over developed-world budgets. Equity-index futures pointed to a weaker open in Japan and Australia and a tepid open for Hong Kong. Earlier, the S&P 500 pared losses to close 0.7% lower. US contracts edged 0.2% higher in early Asia trading. Alphabet Inc. gained in after-hours trading as a federal judge ruled Google won’t be forced to sell its Chrome browser. US 30-year bond yields neared 5% on Tuesday, weighing on tech shares whose valuations had stretched during a surge from April lows. The dollar rose and gold climbed to a record. The yen weakened after a report said Japan’s ruling party is set to call for early party elections. Traders are contending with a range of concerns, from key economic data and US tariffs to Federal Reserve independence, monetary policy and global fiscal prospects. This comes as the stock market appears to be at a crossroads, with the S&P 500 having logged its smallest monthly gain since July 2024, just before what is historically the weakest month for equities. Along with a slew of corporate sales, there’s been renewed concern about longer-dated global debt after years of issuance exacerbated budget deficits. In the UK, the yield on long-dated bonds hit the highest since 1998 and the pound sank as pressure mounted on Prime Minister Keir Starmer to manage the budget. Long bonds are under real pressure from poor deficit and debt metrics in many countries and, in the US, from Fed-related concerns, according to Nomura. “A breach of 5% on the US 30-year will likely further increase the focus on these issues,” said Andrew Ticehurst, a Nomura Holdings Inc. strategist in Sydney. In Asia, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. will be in focus after the US revoked the company’s authorization to freely ship essential gear to its main Chinese chipmaking base. TSMC’s US-listed American depositary receipts slipped as much as 2.3% Tuesday. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump said his administration would ask the Supreme Court for an expedited ruling in hopes of overturning a federal court decision that many of his tariffs were illegally imposed. “The stock market’s down because the stock market needs the tariffs. They want the tariffs,” the president said. Traders will be looking to key US labor market data this week for clues on economic growth and the Fed’s policy outlook. Employers showed little enthusiasm to take on workers during August, and the unemployment rate probably ticked up to an almost four-year high, adding to evidence of a more subdued jobs market. The importance of this week’s economic data will ultimately drive where yields are by Friday’s close – even if there is a lot that could shift investors’ perception of the state of the labor market in the interim,” said Ian Lyngen and Vail Hartman at BMO Capital Markets. On the economic front, US factory activity shrank in August for a sixth straight month, driven by a pullback in production that shows manufacturing remains bogged down by higher import duties. “The ISM manufacturing report indicated that companies are largely managing headcount rather than actively hiring,” said Scott Helfstein at Global X. “This may be a clue ahead of Friday’s jobs numbers. New jobs are likely slowing, but meaningful revisions to data over the prior months could mean that the report, good or bad, may not influence investors much.” Helfstein said investors should pay close attention to wage growth in Friday’s job report. “Wages have been outpacing inflation and that is usually a good sign for consumption,” he said. “While defaults are going up slightly, most of the numbers on consumer behavior have remained robust.”"
"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Godrej Consumer Products, Sobha, Jindal Steel, Britannia Industries, Manappuram Finance, and others on September 03?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-godrej-consumer-products-sobha-jindal-steel-britannia-industries-manappuram-finance-and-others-on-september-03-13514163.html,"Equity benchmarks saw profit booking at higher levels and closed the session with moderate losses on September 2, but the market breadth was dominated by bulls. A total of 1,737 shares gained against 1,043 shares that saw correction on the NSE. The consolidation is expected to continue as long as the frontline indices trade below short-term moving averages. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Amol Athawale, VP Technical Research at Kotak Securities Godrej Consumer Products | CMP: Rs 1,283.8  Godrej Consumer Products has given a breakout of its symmetrical triangle chart pattern with a bullish candlestick formation, along with incremental volume activity. Additionally, on daily and weekly charts, it has formed a higher bottom series; therefore, the structure of the stock indicates further bullish momentum in the coming horizon. Unless it is trading below Rs 1,240, positional traders can retain an optimistic stance and look for a target of Rs 1,380. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,380 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,240 Jindal Steel & Power | CMP: Rs 975.15  On the daily charts, Jindal Steel & Power is in a rising channel chart formation with a higher high and higher low series pattern. The counter witnessed a steady recovery from trendline support levels. Additionally, the technical indicator RSI is also indicating a further uptrend from current levels, which could boost bullish momentum in the near future. For positional traders, Rs 940 would be the decisive level. Trading above the same, the uptrend formation will continue till Rs 1,040. However, if it closes below Rs 940, traders may prefer to exit long positions. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,040 Stop-Loss: Rs 940 Sobha | CMP: Rs 1,460.2  On a daily timeframe, Sobha had been in a downtrend. Therefore, it is currently in an oversold territory and available near its demand area. The texture of the chart formation and technical indicator RSI indicate that the stock is very likely to rebound for a new leg of the up move from its demand zone. For the next few trading sessions, Rs 1,405 could be the trend-decider level for the bulls. If it sustains above the same, we can expect further uptrend towards Rs 1,560. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,560 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,405 Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors Britannia Industries | CMP: Rs 5,891.5  The FMCG sector continued to outshine post the announcement of GST 2.0, in which Britannia is one of the top performers. In the previous session, the stock managed to close in green despite major indices falling, and now it is trading on the edge of giving a breakout of the rounding bottom pattern on the daily chart. Also, prices have been protecting the prior day’s low on a closing basis for the past 6 trading sessions, indicating consistent buying. Along with this, KST (Know Sure Thing) has already turned above the signal line (red), and now if it trades above the zero line, it can trigger a fresh rally in the stock. The current trend for Britannia looks positive. For now, a break above Rs 5,930 can lift prices higher towards Rs 6,160, followed by Rs 6,300. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 6,160, Rs 6,300 Stop-Loss: Rs 5,700 Saregama India | CMP: Rs 491.9  In the previous session, Saregama India was up by 1.5%. Prices have managed to protect the prior day’s low for the past 4 trading sessions, indicating steady buying in the stock. On the daily chart, the stock is currently trading in a rectangular range of Rs 467–505 since July 2025, which indicates accumulation. As of now, prices are on the verge of a breakout of the said consolidation, and a break above the upper end of the range, i.e., near Rs 505 levels, can trigger a fresh rally in the stock. Prices have just closed above the 50-day Simple Moving Average, but follow-up buying is required to confirm the breakout. The trend for the stock looks positive. For now, a break above Rs 505 can start a fresh move on the upside towards Rs 530, followed by Rs 550. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 530, Rs 550 Stop-Loss: Rs 480 Manappuram Finance | CMP: Rs 281  Manappuram Finance has been outperforming its sector and continued to follow its upward sloping trendline since February 2025. In the previous week, prices found support near the trendline and have seen a reversal of more than 8% from it. Also, prices have closed above the prior day’s high for two consecutive days, which is a positive sign. For now, acceptance above Rs 285 is required for upward momentum to continue. Along with this, the 15-period EMA and 30-period EMA have recently witnessed a bullish crossover, which further reinforces the positive outlook for the stock. The current trend is bullish. A break above Rs 285 can lead to a trending move towards Rs 300, followed by Rs 315. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 300, Rs 315 Stop-Loss: Rs 270 Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

"M&M, Tata Motors shares fall up to 2% amid buzz of GST hike on EVs priced from Rs 20-40 lakh",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/m-m-tata-motors-shares-fall-up-to-2-amid-buzz-of-gst-hike-on-evs-priced-from-rs-20-40-lakh-13512136.html,"The shares of Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) and Tata Motors dropped sharply in afternoon trade after a report said that an Indian tax panel has proposed to hike GST on some electric cars from the existing 5 percent to 18 percent. M&M shares dropped more than 2 percent to trade at Rs 3,247 apiece, emerging as the top loser on the Nifty 50 index. Tata Motors shares were down nearly 1 percent to trade at Rs 685 apiece. The Indian tax panel has proposed to increase the GST rate to 18 percent from the current 5 percent for EVs priced between Rs 20 lakh and Rs 40 lakh, Reuters reported. For cars priced above Rs 40 lakh, the panel has recommended raising the GST rate to 28 percent as such vehicles cater to the ""upper segment"" of the society and are largely imported rather than manufactured domestically, it added. ""The uptake of electric vehicles is increasing and while, the low rate of 5% is to incentivise faster adoption of electric vehicles, it is also important to signal that higher-priced EVs can be taxed at higher rates,"" Reuters quoted a document by the tax panel as saying. The GST Council, which is set to meet between September 3 and September 4, to review prospective GST reforms, already has a proposal to completely do away with the 28 percent GST slab to introduce a simpler tax structure. Hence, the council may increase the tax on EVs to 18 percent or put them in the newly planned 40 percent category planned for certain luxury goods, the report cited a government source as saying. Domestic automakers like Mahindra & Mahindra and Tata Motors have limited offering in the segment which reportedly faces a possible GST hike. If implemented, this will have a stronger impact on the luxury EV makers like Tesla, BYD, Mercedes and BMW, the report added. In July 2025, Tata Motors led the Indian electric car market with nearly 40 percent market share, while M&M held 18 percent share. BYD held a 3 percent market share, while Mercedes and BMW together accounted for 2 percent of the market. Tesla is taking bookings but is yet to start deliveries. The Nifty Auto index dropped 1 percent intraday to its day's low. M&M and Tata Motors shares were among the top losers on the index, along with Tube Investments of India.

Buy Aditya Birla Lifestyle Brands; target of Rs 170: Emkay Global Financial,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-aditya-birla-lifestyle-brands-target-of-rs-170-emkay-global-financial-13512040.html,"Emkay Global Financial' research report on Aditya Birla Lifestyle Brands ABLBL owns a portfolio of India’s leading fashion brands, having recently de-merged from ABFRL. Leveraging its moat around marketing, distribution, and consumer-centric innovation, ABLBL has successfully scaled up revenue of each of its multiple brands to >Rs10bn. With a goal of improving profitability, ABLBL has steadily moved away from channels that offer high discounts, along with shelving loss-making businesses (eg Forever 21), thus limiting overall revenue CAGR to a high single-digit in FY20- 25 (vs EBO channel: ~12% revenue CAGR; mix: ~45%). However, portfolio correction is largely done – ABLBL now expects to deliver a high-teen EBITDA CAGR in FY25-30, led by low double-digit topline CAGR and an overall 300bps margin gain. After a cycle of network consolidation in FY25, ABLBL’s asset-light franchisee-led expansion (~70%) is expected to pick up, with ~250pa store adds over FY25-30 (~8% CAGR). We now expect ABLBL’s working capital (WC) to stabilize at ~15% of sales, though better WC execution is a potential upside. Outlook We initiate coverage on ABLBL with BUY and Sep-26E TP of Rs170 (25x Sep27E pre-IndAS EBITDA).
