"Supreme Court upholds Delhi HC's relief to SpiceJet over Kalanithi Maran's Rs 1,300 crore claim against the airline",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/supreme-court-upholds-delhi-hc-s-relief-to-spicejet-over-kalanithi-maran-s-rs-1-300-crore-claim-against-the-airline-13311807.html,"In a relief for SpiceJet that sent shares sharply higher by over 3 percent on July 23, the Supreme Court has upheld a Delhi High Court order rejecting Rs 1,300 crore claim against the airline in a plea by Maran-owned KAL Airways. Granting relief to the airline, a bench of Justices Pamidighantam Sri Narasimha and Atul S Chandurkar said, ""Both the special leave petitions are dismissed."" Maran-owned KAL Airways had moved apex court seeking to challenge Delhi High Court’s order that had dismissed claim for damages against SpiceJet over a share transfer dispute. ""These claims were thoroughly examined and subsequently rejected by a panel of three retired Supreme Court judges. Following this, KAL Airways and Kalanithi Maran appealed to the single judge bench of the Delhi High Court, seeking the same amount in damages, which was also rejected by the court,"" the airline had said in May. SpiceJet has been facing financial challenges and aircraft grounding, which has impacted its market share. The airline has also been involved in disputes with other entities, including Credit Suisse, for which it has been ordered to make payments. Reporting on the hearing, legal news publication Bar and Bench said the Court found appellants’ conduct lacking in bona fides and deliberately misleading. The delay in appeal by Maran and KAL Airways was not due to negligence or oversight, but a litigation strategy. Case History The legal dispute dates back to 2015 when Maran, along with KAL Airways had transferred their 58.46% controlling stake in SpiceJet to the airline's original founder, Ajay Singh. The transaction took place at a time of a financial crisis that had grounded the airline for several months, with Singh taking on liabilities. Maran and KAL Airways claimed they paid for convertible warrants and preference shares, which they allege were never issued, leading to an arbitration and later the case reaching the Delhi High Court in 2017. An arbitral tribunal had initially ruled in favour of KAL Airways but the award was set aside by Delhi High Court and later Supreme Court in 2024. Revival Plans As of March 2025, SpiceJet's networth stood at Rs 683 crore and the promoter group had completed an equity infusion of Rs 500 crore, including the final tranche of Rs 294.09 crore in the March quarter. The airline has partnered with StandardAero and Carlyle Aviation to fast-track engine overhaul and fleet restoration. As part of its summer schedule, the airline had launched 24 new domestic flights and added three new destinations - Tuticorin, Porbandar and Dehradun. By the end of 2025, the airline has targetted a fleet size of 52 aircraft, mostly on wet or dry lease contracts."

This comes despite the company reporting a net profit of Rs 123 crore for the first quarter of the financial year 2026, as against a net loss of Rs 839 crore a year ago. This was the first operationally-driven quarterly net profit reported by the firm since listing.

Its revenue from operations meanwhile surged 28 percent on-year to Rs 1,917.5 crore. Paytm said that the rise in its operating revenue came on the back of increase in number of subscription merchants, higher GMV and growth in revenues from distribution of financial services. ""EBITDA and PAT turned profitable at ₹72 Cr (margin of 4%) and ₹123 Cr respectively, demonstrating AI-led operating leverage, disciplined cost structure and higher other income,"" the firm said.

This implies an upside potential of nearly 19 percent from the previous closing price of Rs 1,051 per share.

It said Q1 results missed expectations, with volumes falling 3–4 percent year-on-year and EBITDA declining 11 percent. The weakness was attributed to subdued demand and a high base. While new product launches are aiding premiumisation, Nomura flagged continued margin pressure due to higher promotions and negative operating leverage. HSBC retained a 'Hold' rating while trimming its target price to Rs 2,600 per share, noting that Q1FY26 performance was even weaker than expected despite earlier guidance for a soft H1FY26. The brokerage said EBITDA margins declined even as the company controlled advertising and promotion (A&P) spends.

A slew of brokerages have dished out bullish calls on the stock, while Morgan Stanley remains underweight, citing a broad-based Q1 miss. The EMS major on July 22 reported a net profit of Rs 225 crore for the first quarter of the financial year 2026. This marks a 68 percent on-year jump from the Rs 134 crore net profit reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates The leading EMS player's revenue from operations meanwhile soared 95 percent on-year to Rs 12,836 crore in Q1 FY26. The company had earlier reported a revenue of Rs 6,579.8 crore for Q1 FY25. EBITDA grew 89 percent on-year to Rs 484 crore, while EBITDA margin rose to 3.8 percent during the quarter under review.

Also read: Mutual funds cut stakes in private banks for second month, managers call it a “tactical shift” Nomura has maintained a 'Buy' rating on Dixon Technologies with a target price of Rs 21,154 per share. This implies an upside potential of 31 percent from the last close. The brokerage said execution remains on track across both mobile and component segments. Dixon's Q1 earnings came in ahead of estimates, and the ramp-up in mobile production is expected to continue. Nomura also expects margin tailwinds from the scale-up of multiple joint ventures, projecting EBITDA margins to rise from 3.9 percent in FY26 to between 4.4–4.7 percent in FY27–28. CLSA has a high-conviction 'Outperform' call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 19,365 per share. It noted that Q1 results beat expectations and reiterated the company's FY26 smartphone production guidance of 41–43 million units, up from 28 million in FY25. CLSA believes future growth will be driven by the Vivo joint venture, exports, and other segments. Margin expansion is also expected as component manufacturing scales up, even after the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) benefits taper off in FY27.

Auto, IT and oil & gas stocks opened higher, while the broader markets were flat. At about 9:30 am, the Sensex was up 264.92 points or 0.32 percent at 82,451.73, and the Nifty was up 81.00 points or 0.32 percent at 25,141.90. About 1507 shares advanced, 883 shares declined, and 123 shares remained unchanged. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates ""The 11th new record high for 2025 set by S&P 500 yesterday is an indication of the direction and resilience of equity markets globally. Markets are climbing all walls of worries, and valuation concerns have been put on the back burner. In the near term this resilience is likely to continue,"" V KVijaykumar, Chief Strategist at Geojit Investments Limited, said. Experts also add that upside in Q1 earnings will be the critical point to sustain the current premium valuations. Continued profit booking by the FIIs exerts downward pressure, while steady inflows from DIIs could support a range-bound movement with a positive bias towards Q1 results and the trade deal. Among stocks, Dixon Tech shares rallied 2 percent after the company reported its first quarter earnings. A slew of brokerages have dished out bullish calls on the stock, while Morgan Stanley remains underweight, citing a broad-based Q1 miss. The EMS major on July 22 reported a net profit of Rs 225 crore for the first quarter of the financial year 2026. This marks a 68 percent on-year jump from the Rs 134 crore net profit reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year. One 97 Communications Ltd, the parent of Paytm, surged over 3 percent after it reported consolidated net profit of Rs 123 crore in the quarter ended June 30, 2025 as against net loss of Rs 839 crore a year ago, aided by strong lending business and as it kept a tight lid on expenses, especially marketing and employee cost. Jefferies, Citi Research, and Bernstein gave bullish calls. Colgate Palmolive (India) slipped 2 percent after the company reported an 11.8 percent year-on-year decline in net profit to Rs 321 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2025. Revenue from operations also fell 4.3 percent to Rs 1,433 crore, while total income declined to Rs 1,433 crore from Rs 1,496.71 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. As long as the index holds above 24,800, scope for supportive buying on dips remains intact. A decisive close above 25,250 is essential to negate the prevailing bearish undertone and revive bullish sentiment. Relative Strength Index (RSI) continues to hover below the neutral 50 mark, confirming the lack of positive momentum and reinforcing the current cautious market tone. Until a directional breakout occurs on either side, the index is likely to remain trapped in a low-volatility, range-bound environment. Tata Motors, Jio Financial Services, Maruti Suzuki, L&T, and Coal India were the top gainers on the Nifty. Laggards on the index included Titan Company, Tata Consumer Products, SBI Life Insurance, HDFC Bank, and SBI.

The structure remains broadly neutral-to-weak, and as long as the index holds above 56,400, buyers may attempt to defend key support. However, a decisive breakout above 57,350 is essential to negate the bearish bias and reignite upward momentum,"" he added.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade HDFC Life Insurance, Hindalco, M&M, Swiggy, Nykaa, Indian Oil Corporation and others on July 23?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-hdfc-life-insurance-hindalco-m-m-swiggy-nykaa-indian-oil-corporation-and-others-on-july-23-13310014.html,"The benchmark indices fell by one-tenth of a percent on July 22, following a day of half a percent gains. The market breadth was dominated by bears, with 1,548 shares declining compared to 1,105 advancing shares on the NSE. The consolidation phase is likely to continue until the index shows a strong and sustainable close above short-term moving averages. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Amol Athawale, VP Technical Research at Kotak Securities HDFC Life Insurance Company | CMP: Rs 763.3  After a decline from higher levels, HDFC Life has rebounded from its support zone on the daily charts. Additionally, a sloping trendline breakout has occurred, accompanied by decent volume activity. The stock is witnessing a steady recovery from lower levels, suggesting the onset of a new bullish trend in the near term. As long as the stock trades above Rs 735, the bullish outlook is likely to continue. If it surpasses this level, the stock could move up to Rs 815. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 815 Stop-Loss: Rs 735 Hindalco Industries | CMP: Rs 690  On the daily chart, Hindalco is forming a rising channel with a higher highs and higher lows pattern. The stock has shown a steady recovery from trendline support levels. Moreover, the RSI indicates potential for further upside momentum, which could fuel a bullish trend in the near future. For positional traders, Rs 665 is a decisive level. If the stock trades above this level, the uptrend is likely to continue, targeting Rs 740. However, if it closes below Rs 665, traders may prefer to exit long positions. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 740 Stop-Loss: Rs 665 Indian Oil Corporation | CMP: Rs 152  After a gradual decline from higher levels, the downward momentum in Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has halted. On the daily charts, the stock has reversed from its short-term moving average and found support, with decent volume activity. This formation suggests a revival of the uptrend from the current levels. For the next few trading sessions, Rs 145 will be the key trend-deciding level for the bulls. If it sustains above this level, an uptrend toward Rs 163 is likely. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 163 Stop-Loss: Rs 145 Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors Mahindra and Mahindra | CMP: Rs 3,257.2  Despite the Auto sector closing in the red, Mahindra & Mahindra managed to reach a fresh high of Rs 3,271.90, indicating strength in the stock. Since July 14, the stock has held above its prior day's low on a closing basis and has gained nearly 7%, suggesting a bullish bias. Additionally, the MACD recently gave a bullish crossover, reinforcing a positive outlook for the stock. For the momentum to remain positive, the stock needs to sustain above its fresh high of Rs 3,272, which would further boost bullish momentum. Hence, the current trend for Mahindra & Mahindra remains in favour of the bulls. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,375, Rs 3,500 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,160 Swiggy | CMP: Rs 417.15  In the previous session, Swiggy surged over 5% with a rise in volumes, breaking out of a Cup and Handle pattern, with prices closing above the neckline near Rs 412. This pattern has been forming since February 2025. According to the three candlestick rules, the daily trend has shifted to the positive side. Additionally, Bollinger Bands are expanding, signaling that strong momentum may be seen in the upcoming sessions. However, given the sharp rise over the past two days, the RSI is nearing overbought territory on the shorter time frame. Therefore, buying on dips appears to be a prudent strategy to capitalize on the ongoing trend. A dip toward Rs 410-415 could present a good buying opportunity. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 430, Rs 445 Stop-Loss: Rs 394 FSN E-Commerce Ventures | CMP: Rs 220  Nykaa has been trading in a higher highs and higher lows structure within its upward-sloping channel since March 2025. At the beginning of July 2025, the stock found support at the channel and saw an 11% rise in a short span of time, signaling a strong bullish trend. Currently, the stock is trading near its previous swing high of Rs 220.40. A decisive break above this level is necessary for upward momentum to continue. If this occurs, the stock is expected to move toward the channel's resistance, near Rs 240. Additionally, the ADX shows readings of 30, suggesting that good positive momentum is likely to persist in the stock. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 230, Rs 240 Stop-Loss: Rs 210 Vinay Rajani, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities ICICI Prudential Nifty FMCG ETF | CMP: Rs 59.77  The FMCG sector appears to have bottomed out, with many large-cap FMCG stocks turning bullish on short-term charts. FMCG has underperformed the Nifty this calendar year, but a mean reversion and outperformance from the FMCG sector are expected going forward. We recommend going long on ICICI Prudential Nifty FMCG ETF to capitalize on our bullish view of the FMCG sector. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 63 Stop-Loss: Rs 57.50 ICICI Prudential Nifty India Consumption ETF | CMP: Rs 121.66  The NSE Consumption Index has been in a bullish trend, with higher tops and higher bottoms. Several consumption stocks in sectors like telecom, FMCG, and auto form the majority of the weight in this index. The index is currently above all key moving averages. We recommend going long in the ICICI Prudential Nifty India Consumption ETF to capitalize on our bullish view of the consumption sector. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 127 Stop-Loss: Rs 115 Nippon India ETF Hang Seng Bees | CMP: Rs 425.63  The Hang Seng, Hong Kong's equity market benchmark, has been forming higher tops and higher bottoms on the daily chart. The index has surpassed the crucial resistance of the previous swing high at 24,875. It is one of the best-performing indices globally year-to-date, and this trend is expected to continue. We recommend going long in the Nippon India ETF Hang Seng Bees to capitalize on our bullish view of the Hang Seng Index.

"Understanding risk is as important as returns, stresses SEBI's Ananth Narayan G",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/understanding-risk-is-as-important-as-returns-stresses-sebi-s-ananth-narayan-g-13309578.html,"With a growing number of investors entering India’s capital markets, SEBI's whole-time member Ananth Narayan G has stressed the importance of understanding market risks and volatility. Speaking at the International Conference on Financial Planning in New Delhi, Narayan emphasized that market movements are inevitable and that investment portfolios should be aligned with each investor’s individual risk appetite. He pointed out that while many investors have joined the market in recent years and become familiar with the concept of returns, there is still a need to better internalise the meaning of volatility and risk. According to Narayan, the number of unique investors in the market has grown from 4.2 crore in March 2020 to 13 crore as of today. Between April 2019 and June 2025, domestic investors brought in over Rs 18 lakh crore—approximately $210 billion—into risk-seeking, equity-oriented mutual fund schemes. This amount, he noted, is more than seven times the net inflows of $29 billion from foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) into the Indian equity markets during the same period. Narayan also highlighted the importance of trust and governance in the market ecosystem. He warned that trust can be undermined by incidents of serious governance failures or market manipulation. In this context, he said that first-line regulators—such as exchanges and depositories—along with Sebi and other stakeholders, have a crucial role to play. Citing a well-known saying, he remarked that ""if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is too good to be truthful"". He emphasized that investors should approach the market with a healthy level of scepticism and take responsibility for their investment decisions. Diversification across asset classes was another key point raised in his speech. He stated that sound financial planning requires diversification and noted a tendency among some small investors to heavily concentrate their investments in equities. To address this, Sebi is working to further strengthen the debt and commodities markets, providing investors with more robust alternatives. Narayan also drew attention to rising cyber risks and digital frauds, which are becoming more prominent with increasing digitization. He urged investors to be vigilant and take precautions, as fraudsters—often highly organized and sophisticated—target unsuspecting individuals. In addition, he shared details of SEBI’s initiative to conduct a household survey aimed at understanding how more investors can be brought into the market and how aware they are of associated risks. The survey also seeks to identify measures needed to promote responsible investing. He further informed that, in the near term, Sebi is placing a strong focus on digital fraud awareness. In collaboration with exchanges, depositories, and the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI), Sebi is working on a coordinated campaign to combat fraudsters and shut down unregistered entities operating in the financial space."

"Q1 impact: Deepinder Goyal's net worth surges by Rs 1,700 crore as Eternal shares rise 20% in two days",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/q1-impact-deepinder-goyal-s-net-worth-surges-by-rs-1-700-crore-as-eternal-shares-rise-20-in-two-days-13308418.html,"Eternal, the parent company of Zomato and Blinkit, saw its shares surge nearly 15 percent to hit a record high of Rs 311.25 on the NSE on July 22, extending a two-day rally that lifted the stock by more than 20 percent. The sharp uptick, following a strong June quarter earnings report, added around Rs 40,000 crore to the company’s market capitalisation over the two sessions. Deepinder Goyal Net Worth Surges This rally translated into a significant wealth gain for Eternal CEO Deepinder Goyal, who holds 36,94,71,500 shares in the company. At the time of the earnings announcement, the stock stood at Rs 266. With the stock touching a high of Rs 311 in today's session, Goyal's wealth likely rose by over Rs 1,667 crore. Eternal shares settled at Rs 299.75 on the NSE, up 10.32 percent for the day. At this price, the value of Goyal’s stake stood at Rs 11,071.86 crore, as of July 22. With the recent rise in the stock, Eternal’s market capitalisation crossed the Rs 3 lakh crore mark, placing it ahead of over 20 Nifty 50 constituents, including Wipro, Tata Motors, JSW Steel, Nestle India, Coal India, Bajaj Auto, Asian Paints, Eicher Motors, Tech Mahindra and Cipla. The stock rally was supported by strong trading volumes, with nearly 27 crore shares changing hands on the NSE, generating a turnover of Rs 7,988.26 crore. The delivery volume was higher than the five-day average. The stock is trading above its 5 to 20 day moving averages. ""Eternal once again surprised us positively on Blinkit. This time though, the surprise was more on management commentary than the reported numbers, as it was quite a contrast to the cautious tone post 4QFY25 results,"" JM Financial Institutional Securities said in a note. In the quarter ended June, Eternal reported revenue from operations of Rs 7,167 crore, up from Rs 4,206 crore in the same period last year. For the first time, the net order value (NOV) of the company’s quick commerce business exceeded that of food delivery for the full quarter. Blinkit, which delivers everything from daily essentials to electronics in under 10 minutes, continues to lead the quick commerce space despite rising competition from BigBasket, Flipkart, Swiggy and Amazon. ""We overestimated the competitive threat,"" analysts at Jefferies said, citing Blinkit’s growth, improving margins, and higher growth expectations going ahead. Eternal posted a consolidated net profit of Rs 25 crore for the June quarter. This was sharply lower than the Rs 253 crore reported in the same quarter last year, as investments in quick commerce and going-out verticals impacted profitability. The company, which rebranded itself as Eternal in March, said the results are not comparable with the previous year’s quarter due to the acquisition of Orbgen Technologies Pvt Ltd and Wasteland Entertainment Pvt Ltd from One 97 Communications in August 2024. These firms operate the movie ticketing and events businesses, respectively.

After an initial uptick, the Nifty gradually drifted lower in the first half, followed by a sideways move until the close. Most key sectors ended in the red, with pharma, realty, and auto emerging as the top losers. The broader indices also mirrored the trend, shedding nearly half a percent each. The market continues to lack clear direction amid mixed earnings announcements and muted global cues. We maintain a cautious stance until the Nifty decisively reclaims the 25,250 mark, while immediate support is seen at 24,900. Meanwhile, traders should adopt a hedged approach and focus on fundamentally strong counters, with an emphasis on earnings performance. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The Nifty has remained mostly range-bound, facing resistance at the 21-EMA during the initial trades. On the hourly chart, the index failed to move above the 50-EMA. Overall, consolidation may continue in the coming days, as the index is not showing any signs of a breakout from the current trading zone. On the lower end, 24,900 continues to act as strong support, while resistance is placed at 25,260 — a breakout above which could lead to increased strength in the market.

"Rare earth PSU stocks rally: GMDC, NLC India shares surge up to 6%",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/rare-earth-stocks-rally-gmdc-nlc-india-shares-surge-up-to-6-13308053.html,"The shares of Gujarat Mineral Development Corporation (GMDC) and NLC India significantly surged on July 22. This came as rare earth stocks saw significant interest from investors. Latest data from China shows that the country boosted shipments of rare earth magnets in June, after a global supply squeeze that threatened factory closures and heightened trade tensions. Total export of the magnets rose to 3,188 tons last month, more than double of the 1,238 tons exported in May in the midst of China's curbs. GMDC shares gained around 6 percent to trade at Rs 462 apiece, extending gains for the fourth consecutive session. Earlier, during the day, the stock rallied further to hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs 468 apiece. The stock has recorded significant gains in recent days, amid buzz over Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s prospective meeting on rare earth magnets. More than 1.9 crore shares of GMDC were involved in active trade so far today, which is nearly three times higher than its 10-day average volume. NLC India shares gained over 5 percent to trade at Rs 242 apiece, snapping a two-day losing streak. This comes amid buzz over the state-owned company's plans to list its renewable energy arm NIRL. In an interview to PTI, NLC India Chairman and Managing Director (CMD) Prasanna Kumar Motupalli said that the public sector enterprise is targeting to raise Rs 4,000 crore through the initial public offering route and will file draft papers with markets regulator SEBI in the first quarter of 2026-27. ""We are targeting Rs 4,000 crore through IPO route… So by September we will be in a position to ramp up our renewable assets through NIRL and by March 2026 we will be able to complete the legal and the financial due diligence and in the first quarter of 2026-27 we will be going for DRHP through the SEBI,"" the CMD told PTI. Earlier in May, NLC India had signed a MoU with Indian Rare Earths Limited (IREL) for collaboration in the field of critical minerals The sharp rise in the share price comes on the back of heavy trading volumes. More than 36 lakh shares of the company were involved in active trade today so far, as seen as 1.30 pm. This is nearly 3.5 times that of its 10-day average volume.

"Coal India's 'attractiveness' based on cheap valuation an 'optical illusion', says Choice Institutional Equities",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/coal-india-s-attractiveness-based-on-cheap-valuation-an-optical-illusion-says-choice-broking-13307387.html,"Shares of Coal India, world's largest coal producer, flat on a YTD basis, could be a 'Value Trap' according to Choice Institutional Equities, as the 'attractiveness' based on cheap valuation is an 'optical illusion', rating the stock as a 'Sell'. ""The stock trades at cheap valuation multiples of ~5x/9x/1x FY27E forward EV/EBITDA, P/E and EV/CE respectively. These headline multiples make the stock look attractive, but we believe it is a Value Trap as these metrics conceal more than they reveal,"" said a Choice Institutional Equities note. The brokerage has cited five key 'pillars' to its investment thesis which has gone into the bearish call on Coal India. 1) Pricing: The brokerage said the discounted pricing compared to imported coal, and an unfavourable sales mix has made CIL's business model 'questionable', making the brokerage believe that its motto is 'not profit driven'. At the current Fuel Supply Agreements (FSA), Coal India does not recover its cost of production, Choice Institutional Equities said. 2) Big capex, flat EBIT momentum: The note has compared Coal India's situation to 'running on a tread mill to cover distance'. Over FY26E-29E, CIL will spend a whopping Rs 80,000 crore, which amounts to around 53% of the operating cash flow on capex, yet its EBIT growth is expected to be negative over FY24-29E, said Choice Institutional Equities. 3) Restrictions on cash: Coal India's net cash balance of around Rs 32,800 crore amounts to 14% of its market capitalisation, but there are provisions worth Rs 74,500 crore which may need to be set off against this cash balance. 4) Falling GCV: The Gross Calorific Value (GCV) of Coal India's output has been trending lower over the past 10 years, hurting realisations and profitability. Choice Institutional Equities said it sees 'no reason' to believe this trend would reverse. 5) After capex, all free cash flow paid as dividends: Choice Institutional Equities said it believes a realistic way to value Coal India would be to focus on its dividend paying potential. The brokerage in its note said that the base case scenario for its target price is Rs 290/share, while the upside (10-15% probability event) assigns a value of Rs 500/share, and the downside scenario (10-15% probability event) values the stock at Rs 225/share. Coal India is allocated coal mines without having to bid for them, hence, according to the brokerage, the PSU is fulfilling the government's mandate of supplying coal to the nation. However, Choice Institutional Equities added that any 'reversal' in government policy to align coal prices with a 'profit maximization motive' will challenge its Sell recommendation.

However, higher treasury gains led to an earnings beat, with PAT at Rs8.0bn/RoA at 0.7%. NIM held steady at 2.5%, aided by a reduction in RIDF deposits and the recent SA/TD rate cuts, though partially offset by adverse asset repricing. However, the bank expects NIM to slip in 2Q due to lending rate cuts. Yes’s retail portfolio continues to exhibit stress with slippage ratio of 2.5%, which we believe had led to management churn. Recently, SMBC agreed to acquire 20% stake from SBI (13.19% of the 24% sold) and other banks (6.81% of the total 9.7% stake sold) at sale price of Rs21.5/sh (implying 1.3x FY27E ABV). However, Outlook The transaction is still pending RBI approval and so the bank has halted its search for a new CEO. Factoring in the 1Q beat, we revise up FY26E EPS by 5% and in turn our TP by ~6% to Rs17 (rolling fwd on 1x Jun-27E ABV) from Rs16.

AUM growth moderated to 17.9% YoY/1.7% QoQ, largely due to a sharp decline (23% YoY/7% QoQ) in Unsecured businesses (MFI and Credit Card). This, along with rising stress in the used HCV/SCV segments, MFI and the South-based secured mortgage portfolio, led to a 19bps increase in GNPA to 2.5%, as also credit cost. The bank expects the margin to remain soft in 2Q, albeit to improve thereafter. It has also revised its credit cost guidance for FY26 by 10bps to 1% of average assets due to persistent stress in the MFI portfolio, while refraining from providing FY26 RoA guidance, citing macro and asset quality uncertainties.

Revenue declined 10.6%/4.8% QoQ/YoY, below our estimates. The management attributed the weak revenue growth performance mainly to 4 factors. a) A large digital native client structurally shifted to sourcing directly from MNOs in one country. b) Decline in volumes from CPaaS aggregators. c) Termination of certain low-margin customer contracts. d) Realization pressure in domestic volume. Billable transactions were flat QoQ, albeit grew 5.9% YoY, whereas average realization declined 10.6%/10.1% QoQ/YoY to ~27paise. EBITDAM expanded by 80bps QoQ on the back of the 210bps expansion in gross margin, which was though partially offset by the rise in employee costs due to salary hike. Forex loss of Rs247mn caused a miss on reported profit in Q1. The management refrained from providing specific revenue growth/margin guidance for FY26, considering the continued softness in the A2P SMS segment, customer shift to alternate channels, and macro uncertainty; however, it intends to defend gross margins at the current level and deliver sustainable profitable growth over the medium term.

The higher margin contraction during 1Q (down 39bps QoQ) was mainly due to the impact of recent rate cuts, change in portfolio mix toward secured loans, and sticky funding cost. The bank expects NIM to remain under pressure in 2Q; however, it expects NIM to improve thereon. After consuming the contingent buffer in FY25, the bank has again started re-building buffer at 1% on JLG MFI loans; it still expects credit costs to ease gradually as Card/MFI stress moderates, thus enabling it to deliver ~1% exit RoA in 4QFY26. We cut our FY26E/27E EPS by 6%/5%, mainly due to lower margins; however, Outlook We expect the bank’s RoA to improve to 0.7-1.2% over FY26-28E, from 0.5% in FY25.

Credit growth moderated a bit to 11.5% YoY, owing to slower growth in retail loans, while the bank continues to accelerate growth in the better-yielding SME/BB segments. The bank believes that NIM should compress in 2Q due to swifter rate cuts, partly offset by the recent SA rate cut in June. Notwithstanding the expected near-term margin pressure across the sector (including for ICICIB), Outlook We believe the bank is well positioned to deliver 2.1-2.3% RoA over FY26-28E, aided by better cost management, improving fees, and contained LLP. Thus, we retain BUY with an unchanged TP of Rs1,600, on 2.6x June 27E ABV and subsidiaries’ value at Rs260/sh.

Buy HDFC Bank; target of Rs 2300: Emkay,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/buy-hdfc-bank-target-of-rs-2300-emkay-13307814.html,"Emkay's research report on HDFC Bank HDFC Bank is gradually stepping up credit growth, although margin slipped by 23bps QoQ from a higher base in 4Q due to swift rate cuts and lower interest on IT refund. The bank registered one-off gains from HDB Fin OFS in the IPO which it prudently utilized to shore-up floating/contingent provision buffer to the tune of Rs107bn, with o/s now at Rs366bn/1.4% of loans; this hence makes the balance sheet (BS) much more resilient. With liquidity improving, HDFCB guides to further accelerate growth in H2FY26, in line with the system, and outpace the system growth in FY27 and thus reduce the growth gap with large peers. This, along with shifting portfolio mix toward retail/SME and substitution of high-cost eHDFCL borrowings with deposits, should drive-up the bank’s margins over FY27-28E and in turn the RoA to 1.9-2%.

This superlative performance was, however, dampened by the exit of Dr Om Manchanda who, during his two-decade tenure as MD, fortified DLPL’s leadership position. The current management team, comprising of the CEO and CFO, brings nearly three decades of collective experience to the organization, ensuring stability and continuity. With their continued focus on the existing go-to-market strategy—centered around network expansion, portfolio addition, and bundled testing, we believe DLPL is well-positioned to capitalize on industry tailwinds and sustain its market leadership. Outlook We list below KTAs from the FY25 annual report.

The mgmt guides to sustained double-digit growth in FY26, led by replacement (continued higher growth in 2Ws/CVs; market share gains in the high margin +17inch PCR, 150cc+ motorcycles), and OEMs (rising wallet share, market share across categories). The mgmt expects margin uptick in Q2FY26, aided by a) 1-2% potential drop in RM costs (vs earlier estimate of flat costs in Q2); b) continued pricing discipline. Camso would be consolidated from Sep-25 (not built-in). We believe CEAT stands out on its superior growth visibility, led by high exposure to consumer-facing categories (2Ws/PVs) and sustained share gains (in OEMs, replacement). The demand and margin cycle for the tyre industry is turning positive, and margin revival looks promising. Outlook To reflect such developments and our positive stance on CEAT, we hoist our TP by ~12% to Rs4,600 at 20x Jun-27E PER (18x earlier); retain BUY.

Despite repo cut of 100bps, company expects NIM of 3.5% in FY26 (3.6% in FY25) as (1) certain portions of bank and NHB borrowings would be repriced lower due to their floating nature and (2) only 5% loans shifted from annual to quarterly reset (67% still at annual reset). Hence, we raise FY26E NIM by 9bps to 3.46%. While both Karnataka and Telangana are stabilizing in business terms, recovery has been slower due to state-specific issues. Disbursal and loan growth targets for FY26 are Rs105-110bn and 12-13%, respectively; we are factoring 11% loan growth as KTK and TL are yet to improve materially. Competition from larger peers and banks would be a key factor in achieving growth as per the guidance. Outlook We maintain multiple of 1.8x on Mar’27 ABV, but slightly raise TP to Rs875 from Rs860.

Apollo Hospitals eyes new international markets as Bangladesh patient flow remains muted,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/apollo-hospitals-eyes-new-international-markets-as-bangladesh-patient-flow-remains-muted-13307547.html,"Apollo Hospitals, India's largest healthcare provider, is expanding patient outreach to new markets such as Iraq, Oman and Southeast Asia, even as it expects Bangladesh patient volumes to return to normal by the end of the year. This strategy comes as the hospital group aims to mitigate the impact of geopolitical shifts affecting its revenue due to a significant dip in number of Bangladeshi patients visiting India. “We are now optimistic that we can look at improved volumes coming from international,"" said Apollo Hospitals managing director Suneeta Reddy said in an interview to Moneycontrol. The company has looked at different markets that will contribute. “This includes Iraq, Oman, some of the Middle East countries, as well as Africa. We are looking at surrounding Southeast Asia,” she added. The company has signed a contract with Indonesia, which is not about patient reference “but being able to share knowledge and therefore work with hospitals in Indonesia, which should benefit the hospital immensely”, she said. Bangladesh used to account for around 45 percent of all medical visas issued by India. However, in 2024, these visas declined by 28.2 percent as India restricted visas to following the ouster of the Sheikh Hasina government, subsequent political unrest, and rising anti-India sentiment. The drop in Bangladesh business led to a drop of at least Rs 100 crore in revenue for FY25, representing a 1.5 percent dip. The decline was particularly noticeable in the third and fourth quarters, as hospitals in Chennai and Kolkata get a bulk of Bangladeshi patients. Reddy is optimistic about Bangladeshi patients returning to India due to cost advantage. ""I believe they're going to Turkey, which is something that they have chosen to do, and some probably to Thailand. But in terms of cost, I think, you know, we still have a huge advantage, and we just need to rebuild those relationships, which I'm sure will happen by the end of the year,"" she said. Reddy is also confident of India's long-term appeal as a healthcare destination. ""… I think it won't happen overnight, but I'm optimistic that patients will prefer India as a healthcare destination, and definitely Apollo,"" she said. The hospital group is implementing mitigation strategies, including a sharper focus on high-end specialties such as cardiology, oncology, neurosciences, gastro sciences, and orthopaedics, which are have increased their contribution to revenue. Apollo is also enhancing its local market share by attracting patients from surrounding areas to its hospitals in metropolitan cities. The number of medical visas issued by India reached an all-time high of 597,196 in 2023 but Bangladesh, along with Yemen and Somalia, which, too, have wrecked by social unrest, pulled down the number to 463,725 in 2024. International patients are much sought after by hospitals, as they pay 15-20 percent premiums and spends are largely out-of-pocket. They come to India to avail advanced tertiary care such as organ transplants, bypass surgeries and joint replacements. Along with healthcare, the patients and their family members also spend money on accommodation, travel and other purchases, helping the economy indirectly."

Margins (NIM + fee) improved by ~7bps due to moderating CoFs. LTF has completed the integration of the acquired GL business and plans to expand branches to ~300 (from 135 now; including new geographies). Credit cost remained elevated in Q1 (Rs3bn of macro overly utilized in Q1) and the management expects MFI stress to peak in Q2FY26, with the growth momentum returning in H2. The focus on acquiring prime and near-prime customers, along with a broader rollout of Cyclops, is expected to help contain FY26 credit cost at 2.3–2.5%. Additionally, the mgmt plans to rebuild macro buffers using recoveries from the SR book, where several accounts are in advanced stages of resolution and proceeds are expected in FY27– 28. Outlook Incorporating the Q1 performance and the outlook for H2, we tweak our estimates, resulting in 30-50bps change in FY26-28E RoE and 3-5% change in FY26-28E EPS; we retain REDUCE with a revised Jun-26E TP of Rs190 (up 6% from Rs180), implying FY27E P/B of 1.6x.

Buy JK Cement; target of Rs 7300: Emkay Global Financial,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-jk-cement-target-of-rs-7300-emkay-global-financial-13307633.html,"Emkay Global Financial' research report on JK Cement JK Cement (JKCE) reported standalone EBITDA of Rs6.75bn (up 41% YoY, albeit down 9% QoQ), beating our estimate (Rs5.9bn). Gray cement volumes were up ~15% YoY, despite the early monsoons, implying continued market share gains in core regions, incl the Bihar market. Volume growth was robust, coupled with mild pricing gains, as gray cement realization was up 0.8% QoQ (~Rs40/t). Realization gains with operating leverage benefits offset the inflation in variable costs, resulting in blended EBITDA/t of Rs1,247 (Emkay: Rs1,160), which is up 23% YoY and flat QoQ. JKCE is on track to commission the 4mtpa Panna clinker line-2 and 6mtpa grinding units (3mtpa each in Central India and Bihar) by Dec-25. Enthused by JKCE’s strong volume growth and the industry’s pricing resilience in Q2FY25TD, we raise FY26E/27E EBITDA by ~9% each and introduce FY28 estimates. Outlook We value JKCE at 17x (unchanged) EV/EBITDA on Q1FY28E EBITDA (rolling forward basis) and arrive at revised up target price of Rs7,300 (earlier Rs6,375; up 14.5%); maintain BUY.

Over the next 2-3 quarters, Eternal is set to gradually make a transition in the quick commerce (QCom) business, from its current marketplace model to an inventory ownership model; this will drive ~100bps margin expansion, albeit require net working capital of ~18 days. The management sees enough room for storecount expansion in all cities, to 3,000 stores from the 1,544 currently. Food delivery GOV grew 16% YoY, and the management expects FY26 GOV growth at 15-20%. We believe QCom has a long growth runway and Blinkit is seen capitalizing well on this. As QCom is currently in the ‘landgrab’ phase, we believe EBITDA breakeven for Blinkit is still some time away. Food delivery is likely to remain a cash cow for the company, and we expect the business to see 20%+ EBITDA CAGR over the long term.

"Brokers uneasy with ‘Fit and Proper’ norms, raise concerns with Sebi",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/brokers-uneasy-with-fit-and-proper-norms-raise-concerns-with-sebi-13307349.html,"In a recent meeting with capital market regulator Sebi, market intermediaries once again flagged off concerns over the controversial ‘Fit and Proper’ criteria, and while it remains unclear whether Chairman Tuhin Kanta Pandey offered any concrete assurance of a review, the matter appears to be a growing source of unease among brokers. The concerns stem from a Sebi notification issued on November 17, 2021 which outlines stringent standards for individuals in key managerial roles. Beyond integrity, honesty, ethical conduct and reputation, the criteria specify that a person must not be facing a criminal complaint or FIR filed by Sebi, nor be charge-sheeted by any law enforcement agency in connection with economic offences. This includes agencies such as the Police Economic Offences Wing (EoW), Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO), and the Enforcement Directorate (ED). Brokers are specifically urging Sebi to reconsider these two provisions. These conditions, they argue, create compliance hurdles and disrupt continuity in roles such as principal officers, directors, managing partners, compliance officers, and other key management personnel. According to the notification, individuals who fail to meet the criteria - either due to a pending Sebi complaint or chargesheet - must be replaced within 30 days of disqualification. The regulations also impact promoters and controlling shareholders of a company, as failing to meet the ‘Fit and Proper’ standard implies they are barred from exercising voting rights and must divest their stake within six months. Non-compliance could lead to the criteria being invoked against the intermediary entity itself. Brokers claim the rules undermine an individual’s fundamental right to livelihood, especially since disqualification can occur before a court has established guilt. They are also warn of potential misuse, where malicious actors could file frivolous complaints or FIRs to destabilize brokerage firms. Often, charge sheets are filed, but individuals are acquitted later during trial, making the mere filing of a charge sheet an unreliable basis for regulatory action, they argue. The requirement to quickly restructure an organization’s leadership is another major concern. Sudden changes could disrupt operations, impact regulatory compliance in overseas jurisdictions, and threaten business continuity, espcially for brokers with cross-border operations. Also Read: Merchant bankers are gearing up for a ‘beauty parade’ in anticipation of NSE’s IPO There are also practical challenges with the mandated divestment of stake. Brokers point out that enforcement agencies may not allow a charge-sheeted individual to divest their holdings, making the regulation unworkable in such scenarios. In listed entities, any stake sale or change in control could trigger an open offer, which becomes unfeasible if the stakeholder in question is under legal scrutiny, as buyers are unlikely to step forward. Even inter-se transfers, brokers say, may require substantial capital, often difficult to mobilize. Lock-in periods and heavy tax liabilities further complicate matters, making compliance nearly impossible in some cases. Also Read: Sebi nod for Jane Street’s trading comeback still awaited While discussions are ongoing, brokers are hoping for a more pragmatic framework that balances regulatory oversight with business realities and the fundamental rights of individuals. An email seeking comments from Sebi did not elicit any response till the time of publishing the story. As per regulatory sources, these amendments in ‘Fit and Proper’ provisions were made after the NSEL scam so that brokers who are not in compliance can be deterred from the market."

"Bajaj Finance Q1 Preview: Double-digit NII, profit growth likely on healthy loan growth",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/bajaj-finance-q1-preview-double-digit-nii-profit-growth-likely-on-healthy-loan-growth-13307408.html,"India’s largest non-bank lender, Bajaj Finance, is poised to deliver double-digit growth in both net interest income (NII) and net profit for the April–June quarter (Q1FY26), buoyed by robust loan growth and declining credit costs. The NBFC heavyweight is slated to announce its first-quarter results on July 24, 2025. According to Moneycontrol's poll, Bajaj Finance’s NII is expected to jump 27 percent year-on-year (YoY) to about Rs 10,628 crore in Q1FY26, compared with Rs 8,365 crore in the same quarter last year. Meanwhile, net profit is estimated to grow 19 percent YoY to nearly Rs 4,646 crore, up from Rs 3,912 crore in Q1FY25.  Estimates of analysts polled by Moneycontrol are shown to be in a narrow range, meaning any positive or negative surprises may elicit a sharp reaction in the stock price. Among the brokerages polled, Kotak Institutional Equities rolled out the most bullish projections while Motilal Oswal forecasted the slowest growth for Bajaj Finance. What factors are driving the earnings? Strong loan growth: Analysts at Axis Securities expect the company’s loan book to maintain its momentum in Q1FY26, projecting an impressive 26 percent YoY growth and about 5 percent sequential growth compared with the March quarter. Margin moderation: According to Kotak analysts, net interest margins (NIM) are expected to moderate slightly, contracting by approximately 22 basis points YoY to 9.5 percent, down from 9.7 percent in Q1FY25. Easing credit costs: Motilal Oswal analysts have forecast a decline in credit costs, estimating a 20 basis points quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) reduction to around 2.1 percent in Q1FY26. What to look out for in the quarterly show? Investors and analysts will be closely tracking management’s commentary on asset quality trends and any signals about credit costs. Updates on the lender’s progress in its Loan Repayment System (LRS) initiatives and forward-looking growth guidance will also be in focus.

The earnings momentum may pace up further tracking UTCEM’s commentary (echoed by our channel checks) of firm prices sustaining in the seasonally weak Q2. In our view, firm prices (at current levels) in Q2 have the potential to shore up FY26 consensus EBITDA (our estimates being ~11% higher vs. consensus). Further, it is heartening to see UTCEM walkingthe-talk with its efficiency enhancement measures across – reducing lead distance, rising CC ratio, increase in share of premium cement sales and higher share of green power. Factoring in these benefits, we revise up our FY27E EBITDA by ~4% (keeping FY26E broadly unchanged). Outlook We continue to value UTCEM at 19x FY27E EV/EBITDA and maintain BUY with a revised TP of INR 14,600.

EBITDA margin (% of NOV) improved ~60bps QoQ in Q1FY26 despite adding 243 stores (ISec est.: 220) with steady take rate and contribution margin. We believe this is due to rationalisation of marketing spends as competitive intensity cooled off, something we had highlighted earlier from our channel checks. Management reiterated 2,000 stores target by Q3 and guided for 100bps adj. EBITDA margin expansion from pivoting to an inventory-led model. 70% YoY NOV expansion in Delhi, called out in the shareholder letter, is a key positive which explains Blinkit’s aspirations to reach 3,000 stores in medium term. 13% NOV growth in food delivery, though lower than estimated, can be understood given the management transition. Improving demand outlook in FD is another key positive. Maintain BUY. Outlook We maintain BUY on Eternal with a three-stage DCF-based target price of INR 315. (earlier INR 310).

Buy Havells India; target of Rs 1800: ICICI Securities,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-havells-india-target-of-rs-1800-icici-securities-2-13307371.html,"ICICI Securities research report on Havells India While the impact of early monsoon on off-take of RAC, fans and coolers was higher-than-expected, we believe the impact is transitory in nature and there is negligible impact on long-term value creation. We believe (1) Havells is likely to benefit via market share gains as smaller/ unorganised players are likely to be more impacted. (2) The company has invested in solar products and it considers solar as one of the major growth drivers in medium-long term. (3) The company has initiated various cost saving initiatives and it augurs well for long term. (4) We note other segments such as stabilizers and cables and wires continue to generate healthy demand. With real estate cycle progressing well, there is potentially strong demand for finishing products such as wires, lighting, switches in H2FY26 and FY27. (5) Havells has materially increased its investments in cables and wires which is also expected to emerge as one of major value drivers. Outlook We cut FY26-27E PAT by 7.3%-9.1% to factor in weak Q1FY26 and impact of high inventory at company and channel levels. At our DCF-based revised TP of INR 1,800, implied P/E works out to 53x FY27E. Maintain BUY.

Eternal, which owns the Zomato and Blinkit brands, reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 25 crore for the quarter ended June, aided by strong growth in its quick commerce arm. The stock hit a record high of Rs 311.25 on July 22, rallying nearly 15 percent on the day and emerging as the top gainer on the Nifty 50 index. The sharp uptick in share price lifted the company’s market capitalisation to Rs 3 lakh crore, marking a surge of about Rs 40,000 crore in under two sessions. Brokerages responded positively to the earnings, with at least ten firms raising their price targets and four upgrading their ratings, according to LSEG data. The median 12-month target price rose to Rs 311 from Rs 287.5 a month earlier, reported Reuters. Blinkit, Eternal’s quick-commerce platform, reported a 127 percent year-on-year rise in net order value to Rs 9,203 crore, overtaking the growth of the company’s traditional food delivery business for the first time. Analysts at Nuvama said Blinkit “outshines on growth”, while Jefferies noted improved margins and scaled-back concerns on competitive pressures. Jefferies said it had “overestimated the competitive threat” to Blinkit from other players, including BigBasket, Flipkart, Swiggy and Amazon. Swiggy’s shares rose 5.3 percent, driven by positive sentiment following Blinkit's performance, which signals broader investor confidence in the quick-commerce segment. Shares of Info Edge gained up to 5 percent during the session. The company holds over 13 percent stake in Eternal.

The sharp rise in the share prices pushed the Nifty Capital Markets index up over half a percent to hover around 4,701 in early trade, extending gains for a second consecutive session. In a statement issued on July 21, Sebi said that Jane Street entities have been directed to cease and desist from directly or indirectly engaging in any fraudulent, manipulative or unfair trade practices or undertaking any activity that may be in breach of regulatory norm. Stock Exchanges have been directed to closely monitor any future dealings and positions of Jane Street Group, until Sebi completes its investigation. The market regulator said the exchanges have confirmed compliance with these rules. Angel One and Nuvama Wealth Management shares gained nearly 3 percent each to trade at Rs 2,782 apiece and Rs 7,824 apiece respectively. Notably, Nuvama is Jane Street’s domestic trading partner in India. The shares of Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) gained nearly 2 percent to trade at Rs 2,563 apiece. The shares of the stock exchange tumbled nearly 8 percent in the past one month, after Sebi restrained Jane Street from participating in the Indian stock market. This came after a 33 percent surge in the past six months. UTI AMC and Indian Energy Exchange (IEX) shares gained over 1 percent each, while CDSL, Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) and Motilal Oswal Financial Services rose nearly 1 percent. Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC, Kfin Technologies and other capital market stocks were trading in the green with marginal gains.

SEBI conducted an investigation into trades between January 2023 and May 2025. The watchdog alleged that, on some occasions, the Jane Street entities bought heavily in cash and futures in the morning and heavily sold options in the afternoon, thereby creating deception for common traders. Based on the initial investigation, Sebi suspects that the Jane Street entities made an illegal gain of Rs 4,843.5 crore, and subsequently the regulator directed Jane Street entities to deposit the amount in an escrow account, which Jane Street has complied with."
Titan shares gain as firm announces acquisition of majority 67% stake in UAE-based Damas Jewellery,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/titan-shares-gain-as-firm-announces-acquisition-of-a-majority-67pc-stake-in-uae-based-damas-jewellery-13306755.html,"Titan shares gained in July 22 trading session as the country's leading branded jewellery maker company announced to acquire a majority 67 percent stake in UAE-based Damas Jewellery in an all-cash deal. The move will help the Tata group-managed firm to expand business in GCC countries. Shares of Titan Company Ltd. surged nearly 1 percent higher at Rs 3,454.4 per share on the NSE, up 0.62 percent. Titan's wholly-owned subsidiary Titan Holdings International FZCO on Monday signed a definitive agreement with Mannai Corporation for the purchase of its 67 percent shareholding in Damas LLC (UAE), the current holding company for Damas jewellery business in GCC countries. ""The consideration for the proposed transaction is arrived on the basis of the enterprise value of AED 1,038 million (nearly Rs 2,438.56 crore),"" said a joint statement. Damas jewellery's rich brand legacy and strong presence in the GCC region align perfectly with Titan's vision. Damas, headquartered in Dubai, became a subsidiary of Mannai in 2012, and the time has come for investment in the next phase of its expansion in the region, said Grewal. Titan Company is a joint venture between the Tata Group and the Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation (TIDCO). It had commenced its operations in 1987 under the name Titan Watches and later in 1994, Titan diversified into Jewellery (Tanishq) and subsequently into EyeCare. In FY'25, Titan's revenue from operations was at Rs 57,339 crore, in which its jewellery division contributed Rs 46,571 crore, which is over 81 percent.

"Eternal shares hit record high as Blinkit growth outpaces Zomato; should you buy, sell, or hold?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/eternal-shares-eyed-as-blinkit-outpaces-zomato-but-profit-slumps-should-you-buy-sell-or-hold-13306347.html,"Shares of food delivery and quick commerce major Eternal Ltd, formerly known as Zomato, hit a fresh record high on Tuesday, July 22, after its seven percent jump in the previous session following its earnings report for the April-June period. Eternal posted a steep 90 percent year-on-year decline in net profit for the first quarter of FY26, with earnings falling to Rs 25 crore from Rs 253 crore a year earlier. Despite the profit slump, revenue rose 70 percent year-on-year to Rs 7,167 crore during the same period. At close, shares of the firm were quoting Rs 299.75, higher by 10.3 percent on the NSE, slightly off its record high of Rs 311.25 per share. Blinkit generated Rs 2,400 crore in revenue in Q1, outpacing Zomato's food delivery revenue, which stood at Rs 2,261 crore. The firm's consolidated EBITDA for the quarter came in at Rs 115 crore, down 35 percent compared to the same period last year. In the previous session, positive commentary from the management lifted Eternal's stock to five-month highs. The firm said that Blinkit's net order value (NOV) overtook that of Zomato for the first time. “Our B2C operations have now reached nearly $10 billion in annualised NOV, with quick commerce accounting for nearly half of it,” said CFO Akshant Goyal. Should you buy, sell, or hold shares of Eternal? Despite the company's net profit cracking 90 percent in trade, a large number of brokerages remained bullish on Eternal's shares. International broking house Jefferies upgraded its outlook on the firm to 'buy', with an increased price target of Rs 400 per share. The brokerage said that while Q1 performance was mixed, the management commentary was notably positive. Growth continues to be strong, and the margin outlook has improved as competitive pressures ease. Although food delivery growth moderated, the management expects a pick-up with short-term margins remaining rangebound. CLSA reiterated its 'high-conviction outperform' tag on Eternal, maintaining its price target of Rs 385 per share, as Blinkit's performance exceeded estimates in terms of GOV and contribution. Bernstein, too, reaffirmed its 'outperform' rating, hiking its target price to Rs 320 per share on the strong beat in the quick-commerce segment. On the flip side, Macquarie was an outlier with an 'underperform' rating and a price target of Rs 150 per share. The brokerage said that food delivery growth lagged, even as quick commerce posted explosive growth. The moderation in quick commerce losses is viewed as a positive. However, competitive intensity is expected to stay high, leading to a prolonged period of losses.

"Three key risks for Indian equities but rest of 2025 likely to be better, says StanC's top investment official",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/three-key-risks-for-indian-equities-but-rest-of-2025-likely-to-be-better-says-stanc-s-top-investment-official-13305781.html,"Global policy uncertainties along with slowing global growth concerns and escalating geopolitical tensions are the key risks for equities in India in the second half of 2025, says Manpreet Gill, Chief Investment Officer - Africa, Middle East & Europe (AMEE), Standard Chartered. He, however, adds that earnings and economic growth in India are expected to revive in the second half with the worst behind us and domestic focused sectors are likely to do well. “I would rank policy uncertainty as the highest risk because that goes with the heart of US trade policy and where do we end up... I would say growth downturn perhaps would come a close second with geopolitical concerns as well,” said Gill in an interaction with Moneycontrol. “A lot of the risks globally and for India ultimately stem from the risk to US inflation. We talk about tariffs, we talk about oil prices, geopolitics, but a channel to financial markets, and how they become a risk for markets is actually because of their impact on inflation,” added Gill. In an India Market Outlook report released earlier this month, Standard Chartered stated that it stays “overweight equities” as “easing financial conditions, improving macro fundamentals and revival in corporate earnings amid a weak USD (US dollar) outlook are supportive of risk assets outperformance”. “We believe both, economic and earnings growth is likely to revive in H2 2025. Easing financial conditions and the fiscal boost via income tax cuts is likely to lift consumption supporting domestic demand and corporate earnings performance. In our view, though the worst for Indian assets maybe behind us, investors need to be selective in risk taking,” added the report. According to the global foreign bank, the first half of 2025 was a textbook lesson in investing through volatility and overall, asset class performance suggests a favourable risk environment with Indian equities, bonds and gold delivering 9%, 5% and 26% returns (local currency) respectively. “We are not expecting to return to the heady days of 25% annualised returns on Nifty but we still think that it is the best place to be in terms of delivering the best returns and we don't think it needs much beyond stabilisation of growth to actually get to that point,” said Gill. The global investment expert is bullish on domestic focussed sectors like financials, healthcare and consumer discretionary while advising investors to be cautious on IT. Meanwhile, the three key lessons for investors, according to Standard Chartered are that market timing is difficult and costly, diversified allocation can help tide through volatility, and geopolitical conflicts tend to have a short-term impact. The foreign bank also expects bond yields to decline modestly over a 12-month horizon. “Frontloaded policy easing and improving banking system liquidity are offset by unattractive yield premiums. We see steepening of domestic bond yield curve and are OW medium-maturity bonds and high-quality (AAA) corporate bonds,’ stated the report. Interestingly, according to Gill, the worst is behind us and investors should stay invested in equities even as there was heightened volatility witnessed in the first half of 2025. “We believe that with Indian equities as well as with global equities, one should expect volatility, but we still think is better off to stay invested,” said Gill.

Zomato-parent Eternal's shares rally over 7% despite 90% plunge in Q1 net profit: Here's why,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/zomato-parent-eternal-s-shares-rally-over-7-despite-90-plunge-in-net-profit-here-s-why-13304098.html,"Online delivery firm Eternal's shares sharply rallied 7.5 percent to close at Rs 276.50 apiece on NSE. This happened after the company released its results for the first quarter of the financial year 2026. Zomato's parent company reported a 90 percent on-year drop in net profit to Rs 25 crore in Q1 FY26. Its revenue from operations however rose 70 percent on-year to Rs 7,167 crore during the quarter under review. However, positive management commentary led to Eternal's shares hit five-month high on July 21. Blinkit beats Zomato in NOV: Eternal said that Q1 marked the first quarter where Blinkit's net order value (NOV) surpassed that of Zomato. ""On an annualized basis, we are now at almost $10 billion of annual NOV across our B2C businesses and quick commerce is now our largest B2C business contributing to almost half of this annualized NOV,"" said Eternal CFO Akshant Goyal. Blinkit added 243 stores during the quarter under review, taking its store count to 1,544 stores by the end of the quarter. ""We are on track to get to 2,000 stores by Dec 2025. We also added 0.4 million sq ft of warehousing space and now operate over 5.6 million sq ft of warehousing space across the country,"" said Blinkit CEO Albinder Dhindsa. Blinkit's revenue surges 154%: The firm reported quick commerce revenue at Rs 2,400 crore for Q1 FY26, marking a surge of nearly 154 percent YoY from Rs 942 crore in Q1 FY25. Revenue generated from food delivery segment rose over 16 percent on-year to Rs 2,261 crore. Zomato's adjusted EBITDA margin rises on-year: Eternal said that its adjusted EBITDA margin for Zomato stood at 5 percent in Q1 FY26, higher than the 3.9 percent reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year. Eternal noted that its food delivery margins have declined sequentially. ""I think the YoY growth is likely to bottom out now as we recover from the demand slowdown we started seeing in late 2024. For FY26, it looks unlikely that the business will deliver a 20%+ NOV growth but we should be north of 15% and hopefully trending towards 20% YoY growth in FY27,"" said Deepinder Goyal. Management on new entrants in food delivery segment: When asked about the possible disruption from the entry of new players in the food delivery segments, Goyal said that it is inevitable. ""New ideas, new entrants and disruption are all inevitable. I think it also makes our business stronger as long as we are able to learn, adapt and out-innovate potential competition. At this point, we do not see any innovation in the space which makes us believe that this business is under any obvious threat,"" he said. This comes amid buzz over cab-hailing platform Rapido's potential entry into the food delivery segment. Eternal announces incorporation of Blinkit Foods: Eternal's board has approved the incorporation of its wholly-owned subsidiary Blinkit Foods with a proposed share capital of Rs 10 lakh. ""Blinkit Foods is proposed to be incorporated as a wholly owned subsidiary and would inter-alia engage in the business of providing food services (including innovation, preparation, sourcing, sale and delivery of food to customers),"" the company said. District generating higher average revenue per order than Zomato, Blinkit: Zomato CFO Akshant Goyal said that the average revenue per order generated by its going out business (District) is more than Rs 160, which is meaningfully higher than our food delivery (Zomato) and quick commerce (Blinkit) businesses. ""If we execute well, this business has the potential to scale to $3 billion in annual topline (NOV) with $150m of Adjusted EBITDA sometime over the next five years,"" he added. Deepinder Goyal meanwhile said that the firm's 'Going-out' segment is now a Rs 8,000-crore annualized NOV business. This already represents nearly 20 percent of the size of Zomato and Blinkit. ""In Q1FY26, we had about 2 million average monthly transacting customers transacting ~2 times a month on an average with a net AOV (NAOV) of INR 1,700+,"" he said.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade ICICI Bank, Varun Beverages, Sonata Software, Bajaj Auto, M&M, UPL, L&T Finance, KEI Industries and others on July 22?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-icici-bank-varun-beverages-sonata-software-bajaj-auto-m-m-upl-l-t-finance-kei-industries-and-others-on-july-22-13305295.html,"Equity benchmark indices gained 0.5 percent on July 21 following a couple of days of correction, but the market breadth was slightly in favour of bears. A total of 1,392 shares declined compared to 1,295 advancing shares on the NSE. The continuation of the northward journey is possible only if the market posts a strong close above the 20-day EMA. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi Hero MotoCorp | CMP: Rs 4,408.2  Hero MotoCorp recently consolidated within a tight range of Rs 4,150–4,375, forming a classic triangle pattern on the charts. On July 15, the stock broke out decisively from this formation, accompanied by a significant rise in volume, confirming the validity of the breakout. This technical strength is further supported by the Camarilla monthly pivot structure, which displayed an inside value relationship — a setup that often precedes sharp directional moves. The confluence of these factors suggests strong bullish potential in the near term. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 4,420–4,380 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 4,800 Stop-Loss: Rs 4,200 Varun Beverages | CMP: Rs 489.3  After undergoing a sharp correction of nearly 22% from its recent high of Rs 570, Varun Beverages has shown signs of a potential reversal. The stock has successfully breached a falling trendline on the daily chart, supported by a noticeable increase in volume — a key indicator of renewed buying interest. Adding to the bullish case, a positive RSI divergence is visible, reinforcing the likelihood of an upward move. Despite a 7% gain in the past week, the technical setup remains favourable, and a fresh long entry is still justified. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 490–485 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 530 Stop-Loss: Rs 465 Sonata Software | CMP: Rs 438  Sonata Software formed back-to-back inside value relationships on monthly Camarilla pivots, signaling consolidation and strong buildup. A breakout on July 8 confirmed the end of this phase. Since then, the stock has entered a healthy pullback, finding strong support above Rs 420 — a key technical level. Holding above this mark suggests buyer strength, and if sustained, Sonata Software may resume its upward trajectory in the coming sessions, with potential for further gains. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 440–430 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 500 Stop-Loss: Rs 405 Jay Thakkar, Vice President & Head of Derivatives and Quant Research at ICICI Securities Bajaj Auto | CMP: Rs 8,438.5  Bajaj Auto has provided a breakout from the falling trendline, and there has been short covering in the stock, which is likely to extend post this breakout. Significant Call unwinding has been observed from the Rs 8,100 to Rs 8,400 strikes, coupled with Put additions at the Rs 8,100 and Rs 8,200 strikes, which is positive in the near term. Therefore, in this series, further short covering is expected, which could help the stock bounce back to the Rs 8,600 to Rs 8,800 levels. Traders may consider buying Bajaj Auto Futures in the range of Rs 8,460 to Rs 8,430. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 8,670, Rs 8,800 Stop-Loss: Rs 8,290 State Bank of India | CMP: Rs 824.2  SBI has provided a breakout from the sideways consolidation and has retested the breakout level. It has been observed that the stock witnessed short additions during the previous fall, but since then, it has bounced back from its March lows due to short covering. Recent data now indicates long additions as well. The Options data shows that the Rs 820 and Rs 830 strikes have the highest Call base, but since the stock is trading well above its maximum pain level, the probability of these resistance levels being overcome is quite high. Traders may consider buying SBI Futures in the range of Rs 825 to Rs 820. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 850, Rs 870 Stop-Loss: Rs 814 Mahindra and Mahindra | CMP: Rs 3,246.7  M&M has been forming a higher base with increasing long buildup, and it has more room for long additions as the price nears lifetime highs. However, the overall long positions are still away from their highs, indicating that the stock is not overbought. Once the lifetime highs are surpassed, it can witness further upward momentum. The stock has witnessed significant Put additions at the Rs 3,100 and Rs 3,200 strikes, as well as Call unwinding at the Rs 3,200 strike, which is a positive sign. Although there is still significant Call writing beyond the Rs 3,200 level, the probability of upward momentum remains high as the futures data indicates that bulls have the upper hand. Hence, a meaningful close above Rs 3,300 will likely lead to further short covering in the Calls. Traders may consider buying M&M Futures in the range of Rs 3,370 to Rs 3,240. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,500, Rs 3,600 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,140 Vidnyan S Sawant, Head of Research at GEPL Capital UPL | CMP: Rs 713.75  UPL has witnessed a breakout on the monthly chart, moving above both its recent consolidation range and a downward-sloping trendline. The breakout, marked by a strong bullish candlestick, indicates positive price development on the higher timeframes. On the weekly chart, the stock continues to form a structure of higher highs and higher lows, while sustaining well above its 12, 26, and 50-week EMAs, highlighting strength in the ongoing trend. On the daily chart, UPL exhibits high relative strength despite broader market weakness, supported by a noticeable volume surge exceeding its 20-day EMA average volume. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 820 Stop-Loss: Rs 675 L&T Finance | CMP: Rs 210.58  L&T Finance recently broke out of a large cup-and-handle pattern on the monthly chart, with the current month showing follow-through positive momentum — reinforcing the bullish setup. On the weekly scale, the stock is well sustained above its key 5, 12, 26, and 50-week EMAs, reflecting strong trend alignment. The MACD indicator is trending higher, indicating accelerating momentum. On the daily chart, LTF has shown a bullish mean reversion from its 26-day EMA, accompanied by a volume surge above its 20-day average, further supporting the positive price action. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 240 Stop-Loss: Rs 200 ICICI Bank | CMP: Rs 1,465.8  ICICI Bank has been forming a consistent pattern of higher tops and higher bottoms across timeframes, highlighting a sustained long-term uptrend. On the weekly chart, the stock is consolidating near its 12-week EMA, indicating healthy digestion of prior gains. On the daily scale, it has formed a double bottom around the 50-day EMA, signaling a bullish price structure. The weekly RSI holding above 60 reflects sustained positive momentum and underlying strength. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,627 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,390 KEI Industries | CMP: Rs 3,972.4  KEI Industries has been in a strong long-term uptrend, consistently forming higher tops and higher bottoms. In April 2025, the stock witnessed a bullish mean reversion from its 50-month EMA, reigniting upward momentum. On the daily chart, a positive hidden divergence signaled renewed strength, with the stock maintaining high relative performance despite broader market volatility. It continues to trade above key moving averages — 12, 26, and 50-week EMAs — highlighting strong trend alignment and resilience.

Sebi announces common compliance reporting mechanism for brokers from August 1,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sebi-announces-common-compliance-reporting-mechanism-for-brokers-from-august-1-13304716.html,"Market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) and exchanges have introduced a common reporting mechanism for stock brokers. Brokers will be able to submit compliance reports to Samuhik Prativedan Manch, or the common reporting portal, at one exchange instead of multiple exchanges. As claimed by Sebi, close to a thousand stock brokers who have multiple memberships with NSE and other stock exchanges would benefit from this initiative. The Samuhik Prativedan Manch will eliminate the requirement to submit compliance reports to multiple exchanges where a stock broker is registered. This is expected to reduce brokers' compliance costs. As per Sebi, the new mechanism will be implemented in a phased manner, with the submission of 40 compliance reports in the first phase being implemented under Samuhik Prativedan Manch from August 1, 2025. As per Sebi, the Samuhik Prativedan Manch for brokers encourages a regulatory framework that is simple, transparent, and cost-effective, resulting in ease of doing business for the intermediaries and, in turn, ease of doing investments for investors. Streamlining and rationalising compliance reporting is a key measure for achieving ease of doing business. Stock brokers who are registered with multiple stock exchanges are currently required to submit compliance reports to all the exchanges with which they are registered. Sebi said that after the first phase from August 1, the later phases will standardise the rest of the document submissions and encompass them in the centralised reporting platform, across the remainder of the brokers, including commodity brokers.

Apollo Hospitals’ spin-off of digital-retail arm to unlock shareholder value; ‘mid-teen’ revenue growth expected from FY27: MD Suneeta Reddy,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/apollo-hospitals-spin-off-of-digital-retail-arm-to-unlock-shareholder-value-mid-teen-revenue-growth-expected-from-fy27-md-suneeta-reddy-13304116.html,"Suneeta Reddy, Managing Director of Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Ltd, said that the primary goal of the proposed spin-off and listing of its pharmacy and digital health businesses into a new entity, Apollo Health Technologies, is to unlock value for its shareholders. Reddy expects Apollo's core hospital services segment, which constitutes a little over half of the group’s revenue, to grow ""mid-teens"" in the next few years as new capacity comes online. She said the market has failed to recognise the value of the fast-growing retail and digital segments within the broader hospital conglomerate. ""If you look at the sum of the parts, we were not getting much value for this,"" Reddy said in an exclusive interview with Moneycontrol. ""We wanted Apollo shareholders to get value from this transaction,"" she added. Apollo earlier this month announced the demerger and listing of Apollo Health Technologies within the next 18 to 24 months. The new entity will consolidate the company's pharmacy business, both online and offline, with its digital health platform Apollo 24/7 and the back-end supply chain of KeyMed. Reddy said the demerged company is on a path to a significant operational turnaround, aiming to nearly double its EBITDA margin from the current 3.5 percent to 7 percent and become a Rs 25,000 crore ($3 billion) revenue business by 2027. A critical element of this strategy is the digital platform, Apollo 24/7, which is expected to stop incurring losses and achieve profitability by the end of this year. “Currently... the combined entity would have Rs 16,000 crore of revenue,"" she noted. ""If you apply 20 percent CAGR, you would get close to 25,000 minimum with a margin of 7 percent,"" by FY27. This margin improvement is expected as Apollo 24/7 turns profitable by the end of this year, and higher-margin private label products grow, she said. Private equity firm Advent holds a 12.1 percent stake, and Reddy confirmed the business is “fully capitalised” with no immediate plans for further fundraising. The new company — Apollo Health Technologies — will include online and offline pharmacies, telehealth, and backend supply chain (KeyMed). Indraprastha Apollo Hospital lease Reddy shared that the company is currently awaiting a court judgment concerning a long-standing land lease matter for its flagship Indraprastha Apollo Hospital in Delhi. The case is being heard in the Delhi High Court, with a verdict anticipated by the next quarter. Of the 1,202 operational beds in the Northern region under the Apollo network, Indraprastha Apollo alone accounts for 710 beds and plays a pivotal role in revenue contribution. It stands as one of the largest private hospitals in India and is widely recognized as Apollo’s flagship facility.Mumbai expansion Reddy said Apollo is planning to add a third large hospital in Mumbai and will likely announce the location in the next quarter. When asked if this new project would be a greenfield or a takeover, Reddy indicated it would be more of a partnership, citing the high cost of real estate in Mumbai and the difficulty of acquiring existing hospitals, which are often owned by trusts. ""In terms of buying over hospitals, we've really studied that (Mumbai) market. Very difficult to buy over because they're mostly owned by trusts,"" Reddy said. Apollo, which is strong in South and East, has been steadily increasing its presence in the Western region with hospitals in Pune, Nasik, and Ahmedabad. The hospital chain owns a hospital in Navi Mumbai and has acquired land in Worli to build a 500-bed greenfield hospital. M&A and growth The company is targeting mid-teen revenue growth for its core hospital services, driven by both existing facilities and a pipeline of new beds, Reddy said. She anticipates this momentum to build, forecasting ""mid-teens for definitely 15 percent to 16 percent"" year-on-year growth over the next few years as new capacity comes online, along with a focus on high-margin oncology, neurosciences, and cardiac care, which are key drivers and payer mix optimisation. Oncology alone is growing at 15–18 percent annually, supported by Apollo’s early investment in proton therapy and specialised cancer hospitals. Commenting on the profile of patients, she said that Apollo has reduced its revenue dependence on government schemes from 7–8 percent to 3–4 percent. Apollo Hospitals reported consolidated revenue of Rs 21,794 crore for FY25, marking a 14 percent year-on-year growth. The company’s consolidated EBITDA stood at Rs 3,021.9 crore, reflecting a 26 percent increase over the previous year, with an EBITDA margin of 13.9 percent. Hospitals segment, which forms the core of Apollo’s business, contributed Rs 11,147.5 crore to the total revenue — accounting for approximately 51 percent of the overall revenue. This segment also delivered EBITDA margin of 24.2 percent. A cornerstone of this growth strategy is the addition of 4,000 new beds, a move Reddy believes will supplement the 13-14 percent growth from existing hospitals. ""With the addition of these 4,000 beds that we're planning... over a three-year period, this should add another 10 percent to our revenue,"" she explained. While committed to organic expansion, Apollo is not averse to acquisitions, provided they meet stringent financial criteria. ""We have to make sure that return on capital employed currently in our older hospitals is 26 percent,"" Reddy said. ""We want to make sure that in a five-year term, it is around 19 percent post the new hospitals coming on the street"". This disciplined approach has led to strategic acquisitions, such as a hospital in Pune and brownfield projects in Kolkata and Gurgaon, Reddy said. On PE driven consolidation On the topic of private equity companies aggressively entering the Indian hospital industry, Reddy said acquiring existing hospitals is not the only way to gain market share. Reddy said Apollo has adopted a differentiated strategy aimed at leveraging synergies across its healthcare ecosystem and move closer to customers through digital platforms, pharmacies, clinics, diagnostics, and hospitals. ""We are looking at different formats of care, like daycare procedures ...the clinics where people can go for outpatient services and, of course, the tertiary portmanteau care hospitals, with our current ALOS (average length of stay) of 3-3.2 days, should mean that a 450-bed hospital is what you require in some of the micro-markets rather than moving to a 1,000-bed hospital,"" Reddy said. ""So, this strategy has given us a market share of over 30 percent in Chennai. And we believe that this is the way forward. We are looking at this in Hyderabad, Bengaluru, and Kolkata,"" Reddy said. Established in 1983 by Dr Prathap C Reddy with a single hospital in Chennai, Apollo Hospitals has grown to become India’s largest integrated healthcare services provider. Today, the company operates 51 hospitals, 267 clinics, and over 6,600 pharmacies, with a growing presence in diagnostics and distribution across India."

The Rs 3,395 crore public offer was priced in the band of Rs 540-570 per share, and received strong investor interest with about 64 times subscription during the offer period from July 14 to 16. Outlook for July 22 Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities After showing weakness in the last couple of sessions, Nifty shifted into a sizable bounce back on Monday and closed the day higher by 122 points. Nifty showed knee jerk action soon after the opening but was managed to display strength on the upside in the mid to later part of the session and closed at highs. A reasonable positive candle was formed on the daily chart with lower shadow. Technically, this market action indicates pullback rally in the market after the downside breakout of immediate support at 25000 levels on Friday. The negative chart pattern like lower highs and lower lows continued on the daily chart and Monday's swing low of 24882 could be considered as a new lower low of the pattern. Hence, any further upside could be a sell on rise opportunity. The short-term trend of Nifty remains weak, but a decisive move above the key overhead resistance of 25250 levels is likely to negate the bearish sentiment in the near term. Any weakness from the lower highs could revisit the recent swing low of 24882 levels. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The Nifty remained volatile during the day as traders awaited more clarity on the US-India deals. During the session, Nifty found support around the 50 EMA on the daily timeframe, leading to an intraday recovery. The RSI continued to show a bearish crossover on the daily chart, indicating weak momentum. Going forward, 24,900 remains a crucial support level for the index; a decisive fall below this level is likely to empower the bears. On the other hand, resistance is placed at 25,200–25,260.

A strong showing in midcaps added to the momentum, even as smallcaps ended flat. At close, the Sensex was up 442.61 points or 0.54 percent at 82,200.34, and the Nifty was up 122.30 points or 0.49 percent at 25,090.70. About 1720 shares advanced, 1968 shares declined, and 129 shares remained unchanged.

A favourable resolution could strengthen the outlook for export-oriented sectors and enhance India’s relative attractiveness among emerging markets. Meanwhile, the continued moderation in inflation has bolstered expectations of an additional rate cut, which, if materialised, would be supportive of market sentiment. Sectoral indices on the NSE were mixed. Banking stocks led the gains, with the Nifty Private Bank index rising 1.05 percent and Nifty Bank up 0.98 percent. Nifty Metal (0.94 percent), Nifty Auto (0.44 percent), and Nifty Midcap 100 (0.46 percent) also posted healthy gains. On the flip side, selling was seen in oil & gas, FMCG, and PSU bank stocks. The Nifty Oil & Gas index was the top laggard, down 1.22 percent, followed by Nifty PSU Bank (-0.73 percent) and Nifty FMCG (-0.60 percent).

Revenue generated from food delivery segment rose over 16 percent on-year to Rs 2,261 crore. Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) slipped in trade on Monday after the diversified conglomerate reported its earnings report for the quarter ended June 30, sparking bullish brokerage commentary. Reliance Industries reported a 77 percent gain in net profit for the June quarter to Rs 30,783 crore, driven by a one-time gain from divesting its stake in Asian Paints. Even after excluding the Rs 8,924 crore gain, profit was up 25 percent year-on-year, as against Rs 15,138 crore in the same quarter last year. HDFC Bank Ltd, India's largest private lender, rose 2 percent after it posted a decent June quarter, with Net Interest Income rising 5.4 percent YoY to Rs 31,438 crore.

SEBI has allowed Jane Street to restart trading after the US high-frequency trading firm deposited Rs 4,844 crore, two sources aware of the matter told Reuters on July 21. ""The index witnessed a bullish follow-up candle after forming a Morning Star pattern at key support yesterday. This indicates strengthening momentum. For sustained upward movement, Nifty must hold above 25,330. Upside resistance is seen at 25,600–25,700, while 25,000 acts as immediate support,"" Mandar Bhojane of Choice Equity Broking said. ""Bank Nifty continues its bullish structure of higher highs and higher lows after a successful double bottom pattern. Strong volumes suggest buying interest. The index must stay above 57,200 to retain bullish sentiment. A breakout above 57,600–58,000 can trigger sharp upside, whereas 56,800 is key support on the downside,"" he added. Eternal, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, HDFC Life Insurance, and M&M were the top gainers on the Nifty. Laggards on the index included Eicher Motors, Wipro, HCL Tech, IndusInd Bank, and HUL.

"India’s IPO market among world’s most-active, but lags US and China on proceeds",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/indias-ipo-market-among-worlds-most-active-but-lags-us-and-china-on-proceeds-13301893.html,"India’s IPO market ranks among the most active globally in terms of the number of listings, however, it lags behind the US and China in terms of total capital raised, according to the latest EY Global IPO Trends report. In the first half of 2025, India accounted for just 8% of global IPO proceeds, compared to 28% for the US and 34% for China. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates In the first six months of 2025, India saw 108 companies list, raising $4.6 billion from capital markets, which may look like a strong show but it is a 30 percent year-on-year decline in the number of IPOs. The fundraise dipped only 2 percent during the same period, suggesting that despite a slowdown in activity, the quality and size of the issues remained intact.

Issuers are being more selective about when and how they tap the markets, while investors are leaning toward companies with stronger fundamentals and clearer growth trajectories. In short - fewer, but better-quality issues. This cautious tone comes amid a backdrop of heightened global uncertainty. Geopolitical tensions and choppy macroeconomic conditions have made issuers more wary, with several high-profile companies delaying their listing plans or revise valuation expectations. Even so, the second half of the year could see a pick-up, according to EY, which said a robust pipeline is in place from sectors like technology, fintech and healthcare. Many IPO-bound companies have already received regulatory clearances and are essentially in wait mode, ready to launch as soon as market conditions turn more condusive. Read More: BSE shares rise 3% amid buzz of SEBI allowing Jane Street to resume trading India’s IPO market continues to trade at a relatively high price-to-earnings ratio of around 27x, similar to the levels seen in the US, reflecting investor confidence, but also creating added pressure for companies to justify valuations. A slow start to the year - driven by a mix of global volatility and domestic concerns - meant many deals were pushed forward. Now, signs of recovery in market sentiment are starting to show, with the retail investor interest staying committed to equities, and the regulatory environment largely supportive. With macroeconomic indicators turning more favourable - especially on inflation and liquidity - EY expects a stronger second half for primary market activities. Globally too, the IPO landscape has been a mixed bag. The US saw 109 IPOs - highest first-half count since the 2021 boom – yet raised less money overall. China, on the other hand, saw deal activity surge more than 30 percent, with proceeds rising three-fold on larger offerings and strong investor appetite. In contrast, India’s decline in volume coupled with steady IPO proceeds signal a maturing market where investors are focusing more on quality than quantity.Whether that trend changes will depend on how the rest of 2025 plays out. EY lays out two potential scenarios - in one, improving trade dynamics, easing monetary policy, and geopolitical de-escalation could help set the stage for a broader recovery in global IPO activity. On the other hand, continued macro stress - be it sticky inflation, interest rate uncertainty, or geopolitical flare-ups - could keep the market in a wait-and-watch mode. If that happens, both issuers and investors are likely to stay on the sidelines, delaying listings and ensuring valuations remain in check."

The sharp rise in the share prices pushed the Nifty Metal index up nearly 1 percent to hover around 9,545 in the afternoon. The rise was fuelled by several factors. China's dam project boosted metal prices, with iron ore and steel prices climbing to record highs. Additionally, the project may have boosted hopes for reduced dumping of cheap Chinese metals on the Indian market, which may significantly benefit the Indian players in the industry. Chinese Premier Li Qiang had launched the construction of the hydropower project on the Yarlung Tsangpo river on Saturday. The cost of the project is also four times larger than the $37-billion Three Gorges project that was completed in 2009. According to analysts, the project promises strong economic jolt for sectors like construction, cement and steel. The shares of Chinese metal companies significantly surged after the launch of the dam project. India has however raised concerns over the possibility of reduced water flow into River Brahmaputra as a result of the dam. Notably, Indian metal companies have called for strong anti-dumping duties on cheap Chinese imports for a long time now. The possibility of Chinese metal output being absorbed within the country amid higher demand during the construction of the dam may have boosted the Indian metal stocks, along with the rising metal prices. Jindal Stainless Steel (JSL) shares jumped nearly 4 percent to trade at Rs 702 apiece, while those of National Aluminium Company (NALCO) also gained nearly 4 percent to trade at Rs 195 apiece. Vedanta, Hindustan Zinc and Hindustan Copper shares gained over 2 percent each. APL Apollo Tubes shares rose nearly 2 percent, while Hindalco shares were up over 1 percent. NMDC and Adani Enterprises were up nearly 1 percent, while Steel Authority of India (SAIL), Tata Steel, Welspun Corp and Jindal Steel and Power shares were trading in the green with marginal gains. Bucking the trend, JSW Steel shares were down nearly 1 percent to hover around Rs 1,027 apiece. This comes despite the firm reporting a 155 percent surge in net profit to Rs 2,209 crore for the quarter ending June 30, 2025. Revenue from operations rose marginally on-year to Rs 43,147 crore, but fell sequentially from Rs 44,341 crore reported in the previous quarter (Q4). ""While finished steel imports have moderated, exports have fallen as well and India continues to be a net importer. Low priced imports remain a concern, accentuated by changes in global trade flows due to rising tariff uncertainties. While there has been some reduction in steel production in China in recent months, the elevated Chinese exports continue to be a challenge for the industry,"" JSW Steel said in a release.

(1) stake sale gains of Rs91.3bn on HDB listing (2) buffer provisions of Rs107bn and (2) lower tax rate at 14.7% pursuant to favorable IT order of Rs11.44bn. Buffer provisions stood at 82bps vs 96bps for ICICIB. As LDR has declined to 95% from 103.5% a year ago, focus is back on shoring up loan growth/CASA. Targeted medium term LDR is 87-90%. Bank is confident of achieving guided loan growth given strong domestic demand and upcoming festive season. For FY26/27E, we are factoring loan growth of 11%/12% YoY with an LDR of 92%/90%. PSLC cost remains a key monitorable. Outlook We maintain multiple of 2.4x on core FY27ABV but raise SOTP based TP to Rs2,150 from Rs2,125 due to increase in valuation of subsidiaries. Retain ‘BUY’.

PSLC income opportunity was not available in Q1’26 due to change in gold loan regulations. Hence, we cut fees for FY26/27E by ~10%. With RBI tweaking back gold loan regulations, agri growth may improve supporting fees. Reported NIM declined by 11bps QoQ to 2.76% due to fall in loan yields by 22bps QoQ despite a decline in corporate and increase in retail. As a result, we trim NIM for FY26/27E by 7bps/8bps to 2.53%/2.61%. Asset quality remains a silver lining with lower net slippages resulting in controlled credit costs; we GNPA expect to further improve by 92bps from 3.52% in Q1’26 to 2.6% by FY27E. Outlook With core RoA of 0.9x in FY27, stock is valued at 0.8x on Mar’27 ABV.

Hold JSW Steel; target of Rs 1068: Prabhudas Lilladher,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/hold-jsw-steel-target-of-rs-1068-prabhudas-lilladher-13301941.html,"Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on JSW Steel JSW Steel (JSTL) reported strong cons operating performance led by higher steel pricing. Cons volume grew 9.3% YoY aided by the ramping up of 5mtpa JVML capacity and strong domestic demand. Average cons NSR improved 7% QoQ on higher steel pricing across the regions. Decline in coking coal consumption cost by USD14/t was negated by higher shutdown costs, enabling JSTL to deliver cons EBITDA/t of Rs11,837 (adjusting for forex M2M loss of Rs3.43bn). Adj. std EBITDA/t was at Rs11,270, tad better than PLe of Rs11,087. Steel prices have started correcting since Jun due to monsoon-led weakness in demand and cheaper imports, which would impact EBITDA/t going forward. GoI is watching the imports situation and can increase and extend safeguard duty implemented earlier. We believe a) ramping up of JVML having lower conversion cost, and b) rising proportion of VAP would drive earnings growth over FY25-27E; however, concerns over SC order remains. Outlook We expect volume/ EBITDA CAGR of 12%/40% over FY25-27E. At CMP, the stock is trading at 8.9x/7.3x EV of FY26/27E EBITDA. Maintain ‘Hold’ with TP of Rs1,068, valuing at 7.5x EV of Mar’27E EBITDA.

Pure cement realization grew by 5.5% QoQ, driven by price hikes taken in the eastern region since Mar’25. Operating costs declined due to lower RM costs (long-term contract for slag) and optimized fuel mix. This led to EBITDA/t increasing by 42% YoY to Rs1,019. The management will continue its efforts to reduce operating costs by Rs50/t in FY26 led by higher WHRS, higher AFR and lower lead distance under its Project Bridge. NUVOCO has 75% of its capacities in the East, where prices have improved in anticipation of increase in demand since Feb’25. Although monsoon-led weakness in demand is expected to hamper pricing till Sep’25, we believe price fall may not be as sharp as last year due to expectation of higher GoI infra capex and improving rural demand. Outlook We raise FY26/27E EBITDA estimates by 9%/7% on higher pricing assumption and expect EBITDA to grow at 24% CAGR on a weak base over FY25-27E.

"Tilaknagar shares rally 8 percent on favourable Bom HC ruling, ahead of board's fund raise decision",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/tilaknagar-industries-shares-rally-nearly-8-percent-ahead-of-board-s-fund-raise-decision-on-july-23-13301616.html,"Shares of Tilaknagar Industries, makers of a diverse brands of Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL), are sharply higher by over 8 percent on July 21 on very high investor interest, after the company announced that the board of the company will consider fund raising on July 23, and the Bombay High Court ruled in favour of the company in a matter relating to Allied Blenders. The fund raise will be carried out via issuance of shares, debentures, warrants, preference shares, bonds, or other instruments, Tilaknagar said, adding that the fund raise may be done in one or more tranches through the permitted routes such as a public offer, rights issue, private placement, preferential allotment, Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP), or a combination of these. On July 18, the Bombay High Court ruled in favour of Tilaknagar Industries, issuing a pan-India restraint order on Allied Blenders & Distillers (ABD) against launching 'Mansion House' and 'Savoy Club' brands, over-turning a single-bench order that had allowed the sale in West Bengal. On a YTD basis, the shares of Tilaknagar Industries are nearly flat, but over the last one month, they are higher by close to 20 percent. Tilaknagar Industries has been looking to raise funds for a potential acquisition of a whisky brand Imperial Blue from French spirit major Pernod Ricard, Moneycontrol had earlier this month, citing sources. Imperial Blue is India's third-largest whiskey brand by sales, valued at about $600-650 million. Imperial Blue was launched in India in 1997. It is Pernod Ricard's second best-selling Indian whisky, behind Royal Stag, having sold 22.8 million nine-litre cases in 2023 according to the Drinks International Millionaires’ Club. ""As of now, Tilaknagar Industries is planning to fund the proposed deal via a combination of debt and equity,"" one of the persons familiar with the development said. If the deal goes through, it will be the largest in India's alcoholic beverage space in over a decade, when Diageo bought United Spirits for $1.9 billion. Tilaknagar said it is the third largest Prestige and Above IMFL player in Karnataka, where over 80% of all IMFL consumed is whisky. ""We expect this trend of market share expansion to continue across all key states given our strong launch pipeline for the quarters ahead,"" Tilaknagar had said in May 2025. Brandy has been the dominant category for Tilaknagar, but the IMFL maker has forayed into semi-premium whisky segment with the relaunch of Mansion House Whisky in East and Northeastern states of India, and South India. ""The initial traction has been encouraging. Our mid-to-long term aim is to expand on a non-brandy portfolio through innovative launches in the growing and profitable prestige and above segment. These launches will fill up gaps in our portfolio and enable us to have a more meaningful play across the country,"" Tilaknagar recently said."

L&T to build India’s maiden green hydrogen plant at IOC's refinery,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/l-t-to-build-india-s-maiden-green-hydrogen-plant-at-ioc-s-refinery-13301389.html,"L&T Energy GreenTech, a subsidiary of Larsen & Toubro will be setting up India’s maiden green hydrogen plant at Indian Oil's Panipat refinery in Haryana on a build-own-operate basis, a company filing said on July 21. The plant will run round-the-clock using renewable energy to supply 10,000 tonnes of green hydrogen annually to IOC for 25 years, a crucial step in India's National Green Hydrogen Mission. This also aligns with IOC’s strategy to decarbonise refining operations and add to India's net-zero ambitions. At the plant, green hydrogen will be produced using high-pressure alkaline electrolysers, made at Hazira-based L&T Electrolysers. The step sets up LTEG to be a key player in the green hydrogen ecosystem, setting a precedent for industrial-scale adoption across refineries, fertilisers, and other sectors. Subramaniam Sarma, Deputy Managing Director & President, L&T said the project ""not only deepens our partnership with IOC but also reinforces our capability to deliver large-scale clean energy solutions."" Green hydrogen is essentially the hydrogen gas produced by splitting water using renewable energy sources. The project marks IOC's entry into the green hydrogen space, with India's largest-ever green hydrogen project to date. The project is slated to be commissioned by December 2027 and the green hydrogen produced here will replace fossil-derived hydrogen in IOC's refinery operations, reducing carbon emissions. Previously, IOC had cancelled two tenders, following very little interest from the industry to develop the project. The tender was first floated on September 2024, and the deadline was pushed twice to January 2025, on participating companies' insistence. ""This project reflects our end-to-end green energy capabilities — from electrolyser manufacturing to execution and operation. With cutting-edge technology and a skilled team, we are confident of delivering a high-performance, zero-emission plant that sets new industry benchmarks,"" said Derek Shah, Head – Green Manufacturing & Development, L&T. Shares of L&T are sharply off early lows, in line with the broader market rebound, while shares of IOC are trading flat on July 21."
