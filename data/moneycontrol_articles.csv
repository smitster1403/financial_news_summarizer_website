"Chartist Talks: SBI Sec’s Sudeep Shah bullish on 4 stocks, but signals avoid for telecom stock, sees this bank at overbought zone after 81% rally",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/chartist-talks-sbi-sec-s-sudeep-shah-bullish-on-4-stocks-but-signals-avoid-for-telecom-stock-sees-this-bank-at-overbought-zone-after-81-rally-13271785.html,"Sudeep Shah of SBI Securities is bullish on EID Parry and Prestige Estates Projects. “EID Parry has delivered a decisive breakout from its consolidation phase on the daily chart, while the technical structure suggests that Prestige Estates may be gearing up for a fresh move higher in the short term,” he said in an interview with Moneycontrol. He also maintains a bullish view on both SBFC Finance and Ramco Cements, as both stocks have delivered decisive breakouts backed by robust volumes — a strong technical confirmation of trend strength. However, he recommends avoiding Bharti Airtel for now. After an 81% rally in the past 24 weeks, “the weekly RSI falls into the extreme overbought territory for RBL Bank,” said the Deputy Vice President and Head of Technical and Derivative Research at SBI Securities. Have you noticed Bank Nifty forming a double bottom pattern, a bullish reversal setup, on the daily chart? Does this indicate a possible rebound? Bank Nifty is currently trading near its prior swing low, which raises the possibility of a double bottom formation. However, for this pattern to be validated, more price action and a confirmed breakout above the neckline would be essential. Interestingly, the index is also hovering near an upward sloping trendline support, which lends additional technical strength to this zone. That said, confirmation is still pending, and traders should remain cautious until a clearer reversal signal emerges. Adding to the uncertainty, Bank Nifty moved within a tight range of just 756 points last week — its narrowest weekly range since August 2024 — highlighting indecision and a lack of strong directional bias. On the weekly chart, the formation of a small-bodied bearish candle with a long upper shadow further signals selling pressure at higher levels, often associated with profit-booking or cautious sentiment. Currently, the index is oscillating around its 20-day EMA, marking a crucial inflection zone. Momentum indicators are not offering strong cues either, with the daily RSI stuck in a sideways zone, reflecting a lack of conviction. Going forward, 56,200–56,300 remains an important support zone, while the 57,100–57,200 area will act as a key resistance. A decisive breakout beyond this range — especially a move above the neckline if the double bottom develops — would pave the way for a stronger directional move, potentially confirming a bullish reversal. Do you see a strong possibility of a bounce-back in the Nifty 50 after initial weakness next week? The benchmark Nifty index spent the first four trading sessions of the week trapped in a tight 200-point range, reflecting the indecision among market participants. But on Friday, the calm broke. The index opened with a sharp gap down, slipped below its consolidation zone, and faced renewed selling pressure, signaling that sentiment is beginning to tilt in favor of the bears. What’s more alarming is that Nifty has now slipped below its crucial 20-day EMA, which has also begun to slope downward — a classic sign of emerging weakness. The momentum indicators aren’t painting a comforting picture either. The daily RSI has given a bearish crossover and continues to head south, while the MACD histogram has flipped into negative territory. Collectively, these signals suggest that downside momentum may be gaining strength. From a technical standpoint, immediate support now lies in the 24,900–24,850 zone, where the 50-day EMA is placed. A break below 24,850 could push the index toward the next key support at 24,550. On the flip side, a move above the 25,300–25,350 zone is required for bulls to regain control in the short term. Amid this technical caution, macro and earnings uncertainties are only adding to investor anxiety. With tariff uncertainty rising globally and Q1 earnings just getting started—kicked off by TCS on Thursday—markets are entering a critical phase. Investors are now watching for signs of margin pressures, global demand outlooks, and forward guidance from corporates. In this tug-of-war between technical breakdowns and earnings expectations, a cautious and stock-specific approach may be the best strategy for now. What are your top two buying ideas for the coming week, and what are the justifications behind those picks? EID Parry The stock has delivered a decisive breakout from its consolidation phase on the daily chart, signaling a fresh leg of the uptrend. What makes this breakout significant is the accompanying surge in volume, lending strong conviction to the move. Notably, the stock has been consistently outperforming the frontline indices over the past few trading sessions, highlighting growing investor interest and relative strength. As the stock is trading at an all-time high, all the moving averages and momentum-based setups are showing strong bullish momentum. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 1,155-1,145 level with a stop-loss of Rs 1,100 level. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 1,260 in the short term. Prestige Estates Projects The stock registered a swing high of Rs 1,761 on June 24, followed by a throwback phase that was accompanied by subdued volumes — a sign of healthy profit booking rather than trend reversal. Notably, the correction found support near the 34-day EMA. Post this pullback, the stock has resumed its upward journey, supported by a noticeable rise in volume, adding conviction to the ongoing rebound. Over the past few sessions, it has been outperforming the frontline indices, signaling renewed strength and relative leadership. Momentum indicators are now turning increasingly positive. The daily RSI is comfortably placed in bullish territory, while other oscillators are also supporting the ongoing uptrend. The technical structure suggests that the stock may be gearing up for a fresh move higher in the short term. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 1,700-1,690 level with a stop-loss of Rs 1,630 level. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 1,820 in the short term. Is this a good level to consider buying Bharti Airtel, which has reached the swing high of May? The stock marked a high of Rs 2,045 on July 02 and thereafter started witnessing profit booking. Since the last two trading sessions, the stock has witnessed a correction along with a relatively higher volume. Also, it has slipped below the 20-day EMA level, which is a bearish sign. Hence, we recommend avoiding Bharti Airtel for now. Do you think RBL Bank is on the verge of a rounding bottom breakout on the weekly chart, or is it currently looking oversold? Yes, on the weekly chart, RBL Bank appears to be on the verge of a Rounding Bottom breakout — a bullish continuation pattern that typically indicates a shift from accumulation to a sustained uptrend. The price structure suggests growing strength, and a breakout above the neckline could confirm a long-term trend reversal. However, it's important to note that over the past 24 weeks, the stock has already rallied over 81%, indicating a sharp and extended move. As a result, the weekly RSI is currently hovering around the 80 mark, which falls into the extreme overbought territory as per RSI range shift principles. While the broader structure remains positive, the elevated RSI suggests that a near-term pause or consolidation cannot be ruled out before the stock attempts a confirmed breakout. Traders should watch for volume confirmation and price stability near the breakout zone for higher conviction. Is Dabur a compelling buy at current levels, considering the chart pattern and momentum indicators? Dabur has been showing strong relative strength, consistently outperforming the frontline indices over the past few sessions. The recent price action is backed by robust volumes and strong bullish momentum, suggesting growing investor interest and positive sentiment around the stock. However, from a momentum standpoint, there’s a need for caution. The daily RSI is currently hovering around the 80 mark, which signals an overbought condition as per RSI range shift principles. This suggests that while the broader trend remains positive, the stock may be due for a short-term pause or consolidation before it resumes its next leg of the uptrend. In summary, while Dabur continues to show promise, fresh entries may be better timed after a mild pullback or consolidation, offering a more favourable risk-reward setup. What is your view on SBFC Finance and Ramco Cements, both of which had a strong rally in the past week? We maintain a bullish view on both SBFC Finance and Ramco Cements, as both stocks have delivered decisive breakouts backed by robust volumes — a strong technical confirmation of trend strength. In both cases, the price action is well-supported by rising moving averages, and momentum-based indicators are firmly in bullish territory, signaling that the underlying trend remains healthy and intact. The recent rally suggests renewed buying interest and strong participation from market participants. As long as the breakout levels are protected, both stocks are well-positioned to extend their upward momentum in the near term.

Broader indices snap 2-week gaining streak; these smallcaps gain 10-39%,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/broader-indices-snap-2-week-gaining-streak-these-smallcaps-gain-10-39-13270551.html,"The broader indices remained under pressure and lost between 0.6-1 percent amid volatility led by weak start of the India Inc earnings, uncertainty around trade negotiations with US, and President Donald Trump's plans to impose blanket tariffs of 15% or 20% on most trade partners. Among broader indices, the BSE Small-Cap index shed 0.6 percent, while BSE Mid-Cap and Large-Cap indices fell 1 percent each. The mid and small-cap indices snapped 2-week gaining momentum, while large-cap index extended the fall in the second week. For the week, the BSE Sensex index declined 932.42 points or 1.11 percent to end at 82,500.47, and Nifty50 shed 311.15 points or 1.22 percent to finish at 25,149.85. The Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) extended their selling on second week, as they sold equities worth Rs 4,511.12 crore, meanwhile Domestic Institutional Investors (DII) continued their buying in 12th week as they bought equities worth Rs 8,291 crore. On the sectoral, BSE Telecom index shed 4.4 percent, BSE Information Technology index fell more than 3 percent, BSE Consumer Durables shed 2.7 percent, BSE Metal, Energy, Auto, PSU Bank, Oil & Gas down 2 percent each. BSE FMCG index added 2 percent, while Power index rose 0.6 percent. ""The domestic indices witnessed two consecutive weeks of selling amid persistent global trade tensions and a weak start to the earnings season. Delays in finalizing the India–US trade pact, coupled with the US decision to extend tariff deadlines, have added to short-term uncertainties. Additionally, the US move to impose a 35% tariff on Canada further dampened market sentiment,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments. ""Consumption-oriented sectors such as FMCG and discretionary stocks experienced selective buying, supported by signs of urban demand revival and improving margins. A backdrop of easing inflation, declining interest rates, and a favourable monsoon contributed to the overall positive undertone."" ""Broader indices slipped into negative territory due to a lack of triggers to sustain current premium valuations and uninspiring results from a key IT bellwether, which raised concerns over FY26 earnings estimates. As Q1FY26 earnings unfold, investors are closely monitoring guidance on margins and sector dynamics. Upcoming economic data releases including inflation figures from the U.S. and India, as well as China’s GDP numbers are expected to draw investor attention,"" he added. The BSE Small-cap index shed 0.6 percent with Dreamfolks Services, Hampton Sky Realty, Paras Defence and Space Technologies, Sadhana Nitrochem, Garware Hi-Tech Films, KR Rail Enginerring, Sindhu Trade Links, Sharda Cropchem, Sigachi Industries, Deepak Fertilisers And Petrochemicals Corporation, HLE Glascoat, Nacl Industries, Indian Metals & Ferro Alloys falling between 7-14 percent. On the other hand, Peninsula Land, Jaiprakash Power Ventures, John Cockerill India, Dish TV India, Shiva Cement, Force Motors, ACME Solar Holdings gained between 15-39 percent.  Where is Nifty50 headed? Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities Nifty on the weekly chart slipped below the crucial support of around 25200 levels as per change in polarity. Further weakness from here could indicate a failure of the decisive upside breakout of the larger range movement as per weekly timeframe chart. The underlying trend of Nifty has turned down. Further weakness from here could drag Nifty down to 24800-24700 levels by next week. Any pullback rally could find resistance around 25300 levels. Amol Athawale, VP- Technical Research, Kotak Securities: On weekly charts, Nifty has formed a bearish candle, and on daily charts, it has formed a lower top formation. Additionally, after a long time, Nifty slipped below the 20-day SMA (Simple Moving Average) zone, which supports further weakness from the current levels. We believe that as long as the market remains below 25,300/83000, the weak sentiment is likely to continue. Below this level, the market could slip to the 50-day SMA or around 25,000/82100. Further downside may also continue, potentially dragging the market down to 24,800-24650/81500-81100. On the other hand, if the market trades above 25,300/83000, sentiment could improve. If the market manages to stay above this level, it could move up to 25,550–25,650/83700-84000. Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Research, Wealth Management, Motilal Oswal Financial Services As the earnings season progresses, markets are expected to witness volatility driven by stock-specific factors. Adding to the cautious tone, President Donald Trump stated that he plans to impose blanket tariffs of 15% or 20% on most trade partners. The lingering uncertainty around trade negotiations is likely to keep markets in a consolidation mode. Investors will now focus on key domestic macro data, including CPI and WPI inflation prints, while tracking ongoing Q1 earnings and updates on the India–US trade deal. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The Nifty continues to remain weak as the index slipped below the previous swing low on the hourly chart. Additionally, it has fallen below the 21 EMA on the daily timeframe. Momentum also remains weak in the short term, with the RSI in a negative crossover. However, after the recent decline, the index has approached the support of the 200-hourly moving average. A move above 25,150-25,160 in the initial trading hour could trigger a rally towards 25,250 and 25,400. On the downside, support is placed at 25,090 and 24,900.

"Chartist Talks: I-Sec’s Dharmesh Shah sees strong Nifty structure despite recent correction; expects index to reach 25,800 in August",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/chartist-talks-i-sec-s-dharmesh-shah-sees-strong-nifty-structure-despite-recent-correction-expects-index-to-reach-25-800-in-august-13270158.html,"According to Dharmesh Shah of ICICI Securities, the slower pace of retracement while trading in the vicinity of the 20-day EMA highlights robust price structure in the Nifty 50. Hence, any dip from hereon should be capitalised to accumulate quality stocks with strong earnings, he advised, as he expects Nifty to gradually rise and head towards 25,800 in the coming month. After a strong recovery in HUL, he said the stock has logged a resolute breakout from a bullish flag pattern, indicating the continuation of the uptrend. ""This makes us believe that HUL would extend the ongoing up move in the next weeks as well,"" said the Head Technical at ICICI Securities. Do you expect the Nifty 50 to break below the 24,800 support level next week, considering Friday's gap-down opening? Equity benchmarks extended a breather over the second consecutive week amid a lack of clarity on the India-US bilateral trade deal. We expect volatility to remain elevated amid the progression of earnings season, coupled with tariff-related developments, wherein strong support is placed at 24,900-24,800 levels. Currently, the index is undergoing healthy consolidation wherein over past 10 sessions, Nifty has merely retraced 50% of preceding 10 sessions up move. Slower pace of retracement while trading in the vicinity of 20-day EMA, highlights robust price structure. Hence, any dip from hereon should be capitalised to accumulate quality stocks with strong earnings as we expect Nifty to gradually resolve higher and head towards 25,800 in coming month. Do you think the rally in Hindustan Unilever (HUL) seen on Friday will continue into next week? The share price of HUL staged a strong recovery after finding support from five five-year rising trendline, indicating structural uptrend is intact. On the weekly chart, the stock has logged a resolute breakout from a bullish flag pattern, indicating continuation of the uptrend that makes us believe that HUL would extend the ongoing up move in the next weeks as well. What is your view on Piramal Enterprises, which witnessed a trendline breakout? As correctly highlighted, the share price of Piramal Enterprises is at the cusp of breaking out of 3 3-year falling trendline backed by a pick-up in volumes, suggesting larger participation in the direction of the trend. Further, price movement since March 2023 lows has been captured in a well-defined upward sloping channel, suggesting elevated buying demand that augurs well for the next leg of the up move towards Rs 1,500 in the coming quarter. What are your top two stock picks for the coming week? Power Finance Corporation The stock corrected 38% in the past 11 months post which it has undergone base formation in the vicinity of 100-week EMA, indicating buying interest at lower levels. Despite recent volatility, the stock managed to hold on to the key support zone of Rs 360-370, indicating buying demand at key support zone. Key point to highlight is that the stock broke out from a seven-month falling trendline after witnessing supportive efforts in the vicinity of 61.80% retracement of the move from (Rs 225- 580), indicating conclusion of the corrective bias, which augurs well for the next leg of the up-move. Going ahead, we expect the stock to gradually resolve higher and head towards Rs 478, being a 50% retracement of the previous fall (Rs 580-357) wherein strong support is placed at Rs 388. Tata Power Company The Power index snapped two quarters decline and staged a strong recovery. Over the past two months, the stock has been forming a higher base in the vicinity of the 200-day EMA, which has been taking the shape of a rising channel. We expect stock to eventually resolve higher and head towards our target of Rs 445, as it is the upper band of the rising channel that coincided with the December 2024 high of Rs 447. In the process, strong support is placed at Rs 374 as it is a 50% retracement of the February-June rally (Rs 326-416) Do you expect Bank Nifty to decisively break below its 56,600 support level next week? The index has taken a pause post four months of a strong rally, indicating a breather before the next leg up move. The index is currently approaching key support of a rising trendline placed at 56,400. Only a decisive close below that will lead to an extended correction, else the index will consolidate in the broader range of 56,400-57,600. Further, one should note that in the upcoming week, major heavyweights’ banks will declare their Q1 earnings, which will dictate the next set of tone for the index. Do you anticipate a major down move in the Nifty IT index following its consolidation breakdown this week? The Nifty IT index staged a strong recovery from April low. Currently index faced stiff resistance from its 200-day EMA and closed below past 3-week lows. Consequently, current decline is bigger than the previous intermediate corrections seen during past three months up move which indicates pause in upward momentum which would lead to prolonged consolidation.

The session began on a negative note following disappointing results from IT major TCS, which further worsened due to profit-taking in heavyweight stocks across other sectors. On the sectoral front, all key indices ended in the red, except the defensives—FMCG and pharma. IT, auto, and realty were among the top losers. The broader indices also came under pressure, each declining by nearly a percent. Sentiment remained subdued due to ongoing uncertainty around tariff-related issues and a weak start to the earnings season. As a result, the Nifty slipped below its first line of defense—the 20-day exponential moving average (20-DEMA)—disrupting the ongoing positive trend. We may now see a phase of consolidation in the index, with upcoming earnings keeping volatility high across sectors. In this environment, traders should exercise greater caution, focus on risk management, and be selective while identifying trading opportunities.

Gainers & Losers: Top 10 stocks that moved the most on July 11,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/gainers-losers-top-10-stocks-that-moved-the-most-on-july-11-13268212.html,"After opening mildly in the red, Dalal Street fell prey to significant selling pressure through the Friday, July 11 session, as investors rushed to book profits amid concerns of a lacklustre earnings season, following IT giant Tata Consultancy Services' weak quarterly show and disappointing commentary. Glenmark Pharmaceuticals | CMP Rs 2,181 | Shares surged an intraday high of 17 percent after the company announced that its subsidiary has signed an exclusive global licensing agreement for its investigational asset ISB 2001 with New York-based AbbVie. ISB 2001 is currently in the first phase of clinical trials for patients suffering from relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, a type of cancer, the company said in an exchange filing. Hindustan Unilever | CMP Rs 2,519 | Stock jumped up to 5 percent on July 11 after the company announced Priya Nair as its new MD & CEO, succeeding Rohit Jawa, who steps down after a two-year stint. Nair, currently President of Beauty & Wellbeing, will be the first woman to lead HUL in its 92-year history. She oversees a €13.2 billion global portfolio, including brands like Dove, Sunsilk, Clear, and Vaseline. TCS | CMP Rs 3,266 | Shares tanked 3.5 following its Q1 earnings which deepened concerns around the broader Q1 earnings season, with experts flagging limited clarity on growth prospects for FY26 for the IT major. Brokerages noted that the company’s constant currency growth missed street expectations, and cautioned that a meaningful margin improvement over the rest of the year appears unlikely. IREDA | CMP Rs 160 |Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA) slipped 6 percent after its asset quality took a sharp hit in the June quarter, overshadowing strong loan growth and denting investor sentiment. The state-run lender reported a 35.7 percent year-on-year drop in net profit to Rs 247 crore, largely due to a rise in bad loans. Tata Elxsi | CMP Rs 6,066 | The stock tanked as much as 4 percent after the company reported a sharp drop in June quarter earnings, triggering concerns over demand headwinds and margin pressure. The disappointing performance also prompted global brokerages to cut estimates and maintain bearish views on the stock. Zee Entertainment |CMP Rs 137 | The stock price plunged over 3 percent on July 11 after promoters received a second setback from shareholders, as investors voted against the proposed capital infusion of Rs 2,237 crore through preferential warrants. Dreamfolks Services | CMP Rs 160 |Shares hit a new low of Rs 158, falling over 3 percent on July 11 following the closure of the programmes run for its clients, including Axis Bank, and ICICI Bank, effective from July 1, 2025. In terms of technicals, the relative strength index (RSI) of Dreamfolks Services stands at 19.7, signaling it's trading in the oversold territory. Mankind Pharma | CMP Rs 2,578 | Shares of Mankind Pharma gained as much as 6 percent on July 11, before paring almost all gains, after brokerage firm Jefferies increased its price target on the healthcare firm, projecting a potential upside to 18 percent from its previous closing price. RPP Infra | CMP Rs 141 | RPP Infra shares rose as much as 5 percent on July 11 after the company announced that it had secured orders worth Rs 365.85 crore in Rajasthan. The company said the order was awarded to RPP-BCC IV, a joint venture in which RPP Infra holds a 51 percent stake. Bharti Airtel | CMP Rs 1,922 | Shares slipped over 2 percent after UBS downgraded the stock amid expensive valuations. The brokerage is expecting a 10 percent ARPU hike over FY25-28, with later years largely being driven by secular factors. Even the FY26 tariff hike faces the risk of being delayed or coming in with a lower magnitude than anticipated. "

"From spying on wife to fishing for company intel, Sebi battles bizarre RTI requests",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/from-spying-on-wives-to-fishing-for-company-intel-sebi-battles-bizarre-rti-requests-13267793.html,"The Right to Information route, or RTIs - meant to be a tool for transparency – has attracted strange, personal, and downright bizarre queries, as has been evident in some of the recent filings with the market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi). Sampling the queries revealed one curious case where a husband used the RTI route to seek details of his wife's financial portfolio, while another RTI asked for guidance on lodging a corruption case against a certain Sebi official. There are also regular queries from those whom Sebi calls ‘habitual RTI filers’. Moneycontrol managed to look inside the world of weird RTIs landing at Sebi’s doorstep, including this one application received by Sebi on April 26, 2025 where the applicant sought the following details:“A. Is my wife XXXXXXXXXX holding a DEMAT Account? B. If so, how many DEMAT accounts and their details? C. Is my wife XXXXXXXXXX holding a trading account? D. If so, how many trading accounts and their details? E. Has my wife XXXXXXXXXX invested in any mutual funds? F. If so, could you furnish the details of the mutual funds? G. I request to share other information of my wife, XXXXXXXXXX, that pertains to shares, dividends, capital gains, FDRs, mutual funds, stocks, debentures, etc.” Sebi's CPIO informed that the information sought is not maintained by Sebi in the normal course, and hence, is not available with the regulator. Subsequently, the applicant went into appeal, but was later rejected. Another case of an RTI filed with Sebi on May 26, 2025 revealed a query seeking information about where to file a complaint against a Sebi official. “Ms. XXXXXXXXX has been caught red-handed defending (proof attached) the Depository Participant—Bank of Maharashtra—and protecting them from disciplinary actions arising out of multiple regulatory violations spread over a period of one year. Should a misconduct complaint be filed against Ms. XXXX directly with the SEBI Chief, or the CVO, or the Anti-Corruption Bureau, or the Ministry of Finance?” Another application was filed by the same person on how to file a case against a Sebi official, asking, “How to file a formal corruption case against Ms. XXXXX XXXX, who is a XXX in SEBI?” In this case, the CPIO conveyed that the information for lodging complaints against employees of Sebi is available on the watchdog’s website. Yet, an appeal was filed on the ground that access to the information requested was refused, which was rejected on the grounds that the information sought is available in public domain. One RTI applicant - a frequent filer –constantly seeks details of NOCs issued by Sebi to multiple companies for IPOs such as Belrise Industries, Ather Energy, TCNS Clothing, HDFC AMC, RNEL, Tech Mahindra etc. Sebi’s CPIO has consistently replied that such information is not available with the regulator, yet the RTI filings have continued. Sebi noted that not only for the companies mentioned, but the applicant also sought ‘copies of Sebi’s permission or NOC’ for various other listed companies too, through numerous RTI applications. The appellate authority under RTI at Sebi observed that “such repetitive filing of RTI applications amounts to misuse/abuse of the RTI Act”. In the past, there have been instances where one complainant had filed as many as 578 RTIs. As per Sebi’s annual report, in the last two years, 150-300 RTIs were received every month, raising around 6,500-17,000 queries. Similarly, 300-800 appeals too were received. On many occasions, people send complaints as RTIs, for which Sebi has a dedicated SCORES portal. Shailesh Gandhi, Former Chief Information Commissioner told Moneycontrol that public authorities should freely share information as per the mandate of the RTI Act. “Citizens are the owners of the assets of the country, and owners should not be denied information about their assets”, Gandhi added. On concerns of misuse, he said, “There are clear-cut carve-outs like intellectual property, privacy, etc.” Many times, RTIs are more about giving information than seeking information, and hence they get rejected. That’s not all, sometimes the reason for rejection could be the framing of queries, as many people pose them in an interrogatory manner instead of seeking information, people familiar with the issue told Moneycontrol. Also Read: Merchant bankers are gearing up for a ‘beauty parade’ in anticipation of NSE’s IPO RTI experts suggest for a better strike rate in getting information, it is important to know which public authority may have the information. Also, asking for personal information will not get results. The application should be in the tone of seeking information and not informing or raising a question. Information already available in public domain asked under RTI is unlikely to get any response.  For better and quicker response online RTI mode through https://rtionline.gov.in is advised."

The broader markets rebounded from the previous session's sharp selloff as bargain hunting and a broader recovery across Asia lifted sentiment amid hopes of US tariff negotiations. Nifty Midcap 100 is witnessing some of the top gainers as BSE Limited (4.45%), IREDA (4.03%), and PB Fintech (3.92%), as of 9:45 am. With financials leading the chart, Bank of Maharashtra, SBI Card and LIC Housing Finance were trading with a gain of 3.3% to 3.6%.

Indian equities are experiencing turmoil all though the damage is somehow being mitigated by India's strong domestic markets and overall macros. BSE Midcap and Smallcap have opened the trading session at a gain of about 1 to 1.50%. Globally, escalating fears of tariff retaliations against the United States have raised concerns, as we await the next phase of the US-China negotiations. This marks the third bear market since 2020 - with all three triggered by government interventions instead of inherent economic weaknesses. Negative global cues led the 'Black Monday' market with Nifty witnessing the highest single-day slump since June 4, 2024. More than 500 stocks hit lower circuit and over 750 stocks dropped to 52-week low. At closing, Nifty was lower by 742 points while BSE Sensex recovered 1,713 points from intraday low, then closed at 73,138.

All ten constituents of the index traded in the green, with Brigade Enterprises, Prestige Estates, Godrej Properties, and Macrotech Developers leading the gains with increases of up to 6 percent. Brigade Enterprises, which topped the list of gainers within the Nifty Realty index, saw its shares rise by as much as 4.5 percent. The rally came after the company signed a joint development agreement (JDA) for a residential project in Mysuru. The project has a Gross Development Value (GDV) of approximately Rs 225 crore and will include a mix of premium plots and upscale apartments. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog Prestige Estates also saw its shares rise by up to 4.4 percent on April 8. This upward move came on the back of news that its wholly owned subsidiary, Prestige Hospitality Ventures, is preparing to file documents with market regulator SEBI this month for an initial public offering (IPO) aimed at raising Rs 2,000 to Rs 2,500 crore, according to reports. Following closely, shares of Godrej Properties jumped by 6.5 percent after the company reported its highest-ever bookings for both the fourth quarter and the full financial year 2025. For the March quarter alone, bookings surged to Rs 10,163 crore, marking an 87 percent increase from the previous quarter and a 7 percent rise compared to the same period last year. The company stated that this was the highest booking value it had ever recorded. Shares of Macrotech Developers also advanced by 3 percent after the company announced its best-ever quarterly pre-sales figure of Rs 4,810 crore in the fourth quarter, which represents a 14 percent YoY increase. The robust pre-sales performance points to strengthening early-stage market demand, which is a positive indicator for the real estate sector amid ongoing volatility in equity markets. Despite the rally, the Nifty Realty index has declined by 24 percent so far this year, compared to a 6 percent drop in the benchmark Nifty 50 index.

M&M shares gain 2% as it incorporates arm Mahindra Advanced Technologies,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/m-m-shares-in-focus-as-it-incorporates-arm-mahindra-advanced-technologies-12988023.html,"Shares of Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M) gained over 2 percent to Rs 2,548 on April 8 after the company announced the incorporation of a wholly owned subsidiary named Mahindra Advanced Technologies Limited (MATL), with a total subscription of Rs 5 crore. MATL is established under the manufacturing and allied services category and is set to concentrate on technologies related to security. The formal incorporation of the new entity was completed on April 7, 2025, in Mumbai, Maharashtra, following board approval which had been granted earlier on February 7, 2025. M&M has subscribed to 50 lakh equity shares of Rs 10 each at par value in this newly formed entity, resulting in complete ownership—100 percent stake—in MATL. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog During FY25, M&M recorded a significant rise in sales, reaching 5.13 million units, a notable increase from 4.27 million units sold in FY24. This exceptional growth in sales propelled M&M’s market share from 10.79 percent to 12.34 percent, placing the company within close range of overtaking Tata Motors to secure the third position in India’s highly competitive passenger vehicle (PV) market. Additionally, M&M’s market share in the electric vehicle (EV) segment also rose to 7.60 percent in FY25, compared to 6.69 percent in the previous year. In contrast, rival automakers experienced marginal to moderate declines in market share. Maruti Suzuki saw a slight dip in its market share from 40.60 percent to 40.25 percent. Hyundai Motor India recorded a sharper decline, with its market share falling from 14.21 percent to 13.46 percent. Tata Motors also experienced a contraction in market share, decreasing from 13.62 percent to 12.90 percent. According to UBS, M&M’s vehicle volumes are projected to grow by 9 percent in FY26, even as the broader automotive industry is expected to see a more modest expansion of just 2 percent. The brokerage attributes M&M’s projected outperformance to strong demand in the SUV segment, as well as a slate of upcoming EV launches. UBS further anticipates that M&M will roll out additional SUV models in FY26, further boosting its market presence. The brokerage also highlighted that M&M’s farm equipment division, which contributes 40 percent to the company’s earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) and accounts for 30 percent of the sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) valuation, continues to perform well. This segment is reportedly facing no immediate challenges related to technology changes or regulatory hurdles.

Titan shares jump over 6% as revenue rises 25% YoY in Q4 business update,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/titan-shares-in-focus-as-revenue-rises-25-yoy-in-q4-business-update-12988015.html,"Shares of Titan surged 6.5 percent to Rs 3,222 per share on April 8, following the company’s upbeat business update for the March quarter. In its fourth-quarter business update, Titan reported a 25 percent year-on-year increase in revenue across all its verticals. The company’s flagship jewellery segment witnessed a 25 percent growth compared to the same quarter last year. This was largely fueled by a significant uptick in gold prices. However, the rise in gold rates also had a dampening effect on demand in lower price brackets, resulting in only single-digit growth in the number of buyers. Stay tuned to our LIVE blog for all the real-time market developments Titan's eyecare segment recorded a 19 percent rise, supported by healthy contributions in both revenue and customer base. Meanwhile, the watches and wearables division reported a 22 percent increase in revenue. Other businesses under the Titan umbrella—which include fragrances and fashion accessories—grew by 26 percent year-on-year. This was primarily driven by a 12 percent increase in the fashion accessories category. On the flip side, sales of its ethnic wear brand Taneira dipped by 4 percent. During the quarter, the company launched the first experiential store for its fragrance brand 'SKINN' at Seawoods, Mumbai. Its premium handbag brand 'IRTH' expanded with four new store openings in Hyderabad, Pune, Noida, and Mumbai. Taneira, however, shut down one store in the same period. Titan’s digital-first jewellery brand Caratlane posted a 22 percent year-on-year growth, boosted by strong consumer interest in gold jewellery and a robust performance in its studded collection. The number of buyers grew in the mid-single digits, while like-to-like growth stood at 11 percent. During the quarter, Caratlane added 17 new domestic stores on a net basis. At present, around 35 brokerages are tracking Titan. Of these, 21 have issued a “buy” rating, 10 have recommended a “hold,” and 4 have suggested a “sell.” So far this year, shares of Titan have slipped by 7 percent. This decline is slightly steeper than the 6 percent fall registered by the benchmark Nifty 50 index over the same period.

Wall Street equities have been hammered since Trump's sweeping tariffs, announced late Wednesday, on all imports into the U.S. and much higher levies on some major trading partners. Trading volume on Monday broke U.S. records for the second session in a row. In early trade, all three major U.S. indexes touched their lowest levels in more than a year. In the morning, they briefly rallied sharply on a report about tariffs, only to fall again after the report was knocked down. Also during the session, the CBOE Volatility Index, Wall Street's fear gauge, breached 60 points, hitting its highest level since August 2024. After paring gains it still ended the day at 46.98, its highest close in five years. ""The underlying problem of the market is that the administration's approach to trade imbalances is to try a cure that's worse than the disease,"" said Rick Meckler, partner, Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey. ""It's clear that investors favor either a pause or a different look at how to do this. It's very telling that of the many Trump supporters in the investment and business community, it doesn't look like there's anybody stepping up and endorsing the administration's approach to tariffs."" The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 349.26 points, or 0.91%, to 37,965.60, the S&P 500 lost 11.83 points, or 0.23%, to 5,062.25 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 15.48 points, or 0.10%, to 15,603.26. In the first two days following Trump's tariff announcements last week, the benchmark S&P 500 index had dived 10.5% and lost about $5 trillion in market value for its biggest two-day loss since March 2020. On Friday, the blue-chip Dow confirmed it was in a correction, or more than 10% below its December record close while the Nasdaq confirmed it was in a bear market, defined as a decline of 20% or more below its record close. In Monday morning trading, the S&P 500 had fallen 20% below its record closing high. The index briefly rallied more than 3%, after a news report said Trump was considering a 90-day pause on tariffs. White House officials quickly denied the report, sending the market back into the red. Meckler said the market's wild swings on Monday left investors ""a little bit concerned that if facts start to change, you could see a very rapid rise to this market."" ""It's leading to this back-and-forth movement of rallies that are effectively being sold and drops in the market where people are covering shorts or trying to find a place to buy."" Real estate lost 2.4%, the biggest percentage decliner among the S&P's 11 major industry indexes on Monday. Communications services, was the biggest gainer, finishing up 1%. Technology, adding 0.3%, was the only other sector to advance. In individual stocks, the S&P's biggest drags were Apple Inc, down 3.7%, and Tesla Inc which fell 2.6%. Its biggest boosts came from Nvidia, up more than 3%, and Amazon.com, which added 2.5%. Several speeches by Federal Reserve officials and a series of economic indicators, including consumer price data, are expected this week, with investors keenly watching out for any signs of a recession. Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4.45-to-1 ratio on the NYSE where there were 42 new highs and 2036 new lows. On the Nasdaq, 1,447 stocks rose and 3,070 fell as declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2.12-to-1 ratio. The S&P 500 posted no new 52-week highs and 168 new lows while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 10 new highs and 999 new lows. On U.S. exchanges, 29.13 billion shares changed hands, far exceeding the 17.13 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bajaj Finance, GMR Airports, Chambal Fertilizers, PNB Housing, and others on April 8?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-kotak-mahindra-bank-bajaj-finance-gmr-airports-chambal-fertilizers-pnb-housing-and-others-on-april-8-12987972.html,"The benchmark indices nosedived sharply and closed with a 3 percent decline after recouping around 2 percent from the day's low, tracking tariff-led turmoil in global peers. The market breadth was dismal, with a total of 2,448 shares trapped in a bear market, compared to just 193 shares that outperformed. The trend is expected to remain favourable for bears, but some rebound can't be ruled out, considering the significant fall in the past few days. Below are some trading ideas for the near term: Jay Thakkar, Vice President & Head of Derivatives and Quant Research at ICICI Securities Kotak Mahindra Bank | CMP: Rs 2,037.85  Kotak Mahindra Bank has been one of the outperformers in the Nifty private sector banks, and the uptrend has been largely due to short covering. The stock has provided a breakout from a range lasting more than 3 years, which is quite significant. It is one of the few stocks in the current scenario trading near its all-time high levels, reflecting relative outperformance. Due to the heavy sell-off in the markets during the last trading session, the stock witnessed Put unwinding at almost all the strikes. However, it didn’t see much short addition from current levels; rather, the stock bounced back from lower levels. Based on these observations, the probability of the stock holding onto the Rs 2,000 levels—its second-highest Put open interest—is quite high, at least on a closing basis. Below that, there is another critical support level at Rs 1,960. Therefore, the risk-reward is favourable on the long side. So, buy Kotak Mahindra Bank in the range of Rs 2,000 to Rs 2,040. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,120, Rs 2,200 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,960 Bajaj Finance | CMP: Rs 8,568  Bajaj Finance has also witnessed a huge range breakout—a consolidation breakout lasting more than 3 years—and the short covering is still pending. Since the prices have fallen back to the level from where it broke upwards, there is a higher probability of short covering, as the stock has not seen a significant short build-up in the recent fall from the top. While there was Put unwinding at most strikes, additions were seen at the Rs 8,400 strike. Hence, the range of Rs 8,500 to Rs 8,400 is very critical in the near term, while Rs 9,000 is an immediate hurdle, making it the first target due to the highest Call open interest. So, buy Bajaj Finance in the range of Rs 8,550 to Rs 8,650. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 9,000, Rs 9,200 Stop-Loss: Rs 8,220 SRF | CMP: Rs 2,715.2  SRF has also outperformed the overall markets recently. There has been a breakout from a huge consolidation due to sharp short covering. Although some fresh short additions were seen in the recent fall, the prices have reversed from the breakout point, making the risk-reward favourable on the long side. The Rs 2,700 strike Put has the highest open interest, while the Rs 3,000 strike Call has the highest open interest. So, the range to watch is Rs 2,700 to Rs 3,000, and since the stock is near the lower end of the range, the bulls have a favourable chance from hereon. Buy SRF in the range of Rs 2,700 to Rs 2,650. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,900, Rs 3,000 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,550 Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi Zomato | CMP: Rs 209.63  Despite a sharp market-wide correction, Zomato outperformed, closing with only a marginal loss. The stock is forming multiple bottoms near the Rs 195 level, indicating strong support. Traders may consider entering long positions near Rs 205, with a stop-loss at Rs 195 and an upside target of Rs 225. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 225 Stop-Loss: Rs 195 GMR Airports | CMP: Rs 82.22  Unlike most F&O stocks, GMR Airports ended with gains in an otherwise volatile market. The stock witnessed a breakout above Rs 80, followed by a sharp pullback, and has now resumed its upward move. This price action suggests renewed strength and presents a potential buying opportunity. Traders may consider entering long positions near Rs 80, with a stop-loss at Rs 76 and an upside target of Rs 88. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 88 Stop-Loss: Rs 76 Anshul Jain, Head of Research at Lakshmishree Investments Chambal Fertilizers and Chemicals | CMP: Rs 612.8  Chambal Fertilizers, after breaking out of a rectangle pattern at Rs 546, offered no buying dips—until today. The stock has now smartly defended its 10–20 day moving average zone, giving short-term traders a golden entry into the momentum. Today’s bullish candle hints at renewed buying interest, supported by the cooling off of previously overheated momentum indicators. With the trend intact and structure strong, Chambal Fertilizers looks poised to clock fresh all-time highs in the coming sessions. Traders should watch for continued strength above support to ride the next leg up. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 700 Stop-Loss: Rs 580 PNB Housing Finance | CMP: Rs 923.65  PNB Housing Finance has defended its rounding bottom breakout impressively, even amid a falling market, with volumes consistently above the 50-day average, signaling strong institutional accumulation. For the bullish momentum to persist, the stock must hold above Rs 940. A sustained move above this level will likely lead to an initial target of Rs 1,050. The volume profile throughout the entire pattern reflects accumulation by strong hands, suggesting confidence in the stock’s long-term potential and positioning it as a frontrunner once market sentiment improves. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,050 Stop-Loss: Rs 880 Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

"Wall Street trades lower as Trump threatens China with steeper tariffs, markets near bear territory",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/wall-street-trades-lower-as-trump-threatens-china-with-steeper-tariffs-markets-near-bear-territory-12987885.html,"Wall Street's main indices continued to trade firmly lower albeit off lows as investors grappled with growing fears of a prolonged trade war and a White House unwilling to blink. Fears deepened as President Trump doubled down on his hardline trade stance, threatening even steeper tariffs on China — a move that escalated an already fraught standoff and pushed US markets closer to bear territory. Also read: India well poised to take advantage of current situation: Piyush Goyal on market upheaval from Trump's tariffs The S&P 500 shed 0.8 percent, now down nearly 20 percent from its February peak — the threshold that typically signals a bear market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 988 points, or 2.6 percent, following two historic 1,500-point declines last week. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.6 percent and is now 24 percent below its record high, with tech stocks once again leading losses. Markets saw a brief bounce at the open on hopes that the White House might consider delaying the sweeping tariff hikes that went into effect over the weekend. But that optimism was short-lived. The administration dismissed talk of a 90-day pause as “fake news,” triggering a sharp reversal. Over the weekend, Trump defended the policy, comparing it to ""medicine"" needed to fix systemic trade imbalances. On Monday, he issued a fresh warning to China on social media, threatening to slap a 50 percent tariff unless Beijing rolled back its retaliatory measures by April 8. Talks, he added, would be suspended if China failed to comply. Read more: Warburg expected to lead troubled MFI Fusion Finance’s rights issue Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed the hardline approach, telling CBS News: “The tariffs are coming... They are going to stay in place for days and weeks.” The sheer scale and speed of the tariff rollout has stunned investors. Rates have been applied across dozens of trade partners without the usual economic justifications. China, instead of seeking negotiations, retaliated immediately with a 34 percent levy on all US imports. With the administration showing little appetite for compromise, Wall Street is now pricing in a long, messy trade war. The market rout is also raising fears of forced selling, as funds scramble to raise cash to meet margin calls. The CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, spiked to 50 on Monday — a level typically associated with extreme market stress. The sell-off spilled into other asset classes. Bitcoin dropped below $77,000, oil prices fell under $60 a barrel, and volatility surged. European markets slumped for a fourth straight session on Monday, caught in the global equity rout sparked by President Trump’s aggressive new tariff regime. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index dropped as much as 6 percent before trimming losses to end 4.54 percent lower. France’s CAC 40 tumbled 4.8 percent, Germany’s DAX shed 4.26 percent, and the UK’s FTSE 100 declined 4.4 percent, as fears of an escalating trade war and a prolonged downturn continued to rattle investor nerves.

"Futile to predict future, stick to asset allocation dharma, says Kotak's Nilesh Shah amid market turmoil",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/futile-to-predict-future-stick-to-asset-allocation-dharma-says-kotaks-nilesh-shah-amid-market-turmoil-12987853.html,"The market, caught in the crossfire of an unpredictable tariff war, is struggling to find its footing. Every fresh development triggers a reaction, and the uncertainty has left sellers in an aggressive mood while buyers are hesitant to commit. ""It’s futile to predict how events will unfold,"" said Nilesh Shah, Managing Director of Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company. ""What investors can do is stick to their asset allocation dharma."" According to Shah, large-cap stocks are fairly valued and deserve a neutral allocation. But any correction should be seen as an opportunity. ""Buy gradually as markets turn cheaper. That’s how you position to be overweight equities,"" he advised. Amid the global noise, Shah believes domestic stories hold promise—especially sectors like cement, building materials, and consumer discretionary, which offer strong long-term potential. He pointed to several tailwinds supporting consumption: tax rebates announced in the budget, reduced EMI burdens thanks to falling interest rates, a likely dip in oil prices, and the expected rollout of the eighth pay commission next year. Indian equities witnessed a massive bloodbath in today's session. Dalal Street went into a freefall on April 7, as panic-selling took the benchmark indices sharply lower. Triggered by Donald Trump’s tariff tantrum on Wall Street, a wave of global jitters wiped out a jaw-dropping Rs 16 lakh crore in market value — the sharpest intraday collapse since June 2024. Inflation fears, a looming consumption crunch, and recession fears had investors running for cover as the Nifty and Sensex plunged deep into the red. India VIX — the fear gauge of the domestic market — soared as much as 66 percent to 22.85 on April 7, marking its sharpest intraday spike since June 4, 2024, according to Bloomberg data. The dramatic surge has completely erased the downtrend that had been in place since the latter half of January this year.

"FIIs dump Rs 9,040 crore worth of shares; DIIs step in with biggest buying since Feb 28",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/fiis-dump-rs-9-040-crore-worth-of-shares-diis-step-in-with-biggest-buying-since-feb-28-12987782.html,"Foreign investors offloaded Indian shares worth Rs 9,040 crore on April 7, marking their second-largest selloff of the year, official data showed. Meanwhile, domestic institutions stepped in with their heftiest buying since February 28, 2025—stacking up stocks worth Rs 12,122 crore. During the trading session of April 7, FIIs bought shares worth Rs 13,372 crore and sold shares worth Rs 22,412 crore. DIIs purchased shares worth Rs 26,528 crore and sold shares worth Rs 14,405 crore. For the year so far, FIIs have been net sellers of shares worth Rs 1.63 lakh crore, while DIIs have net bought Rs 1.96 lakh crore worth of shares.  Market Performance Dalal Street went into a freefall on April 7, as panic-selling took the benchmark indices sharply lower. Triggered by Donald Trump’s tariff tantrum on Wall Street, a wave of global jitters wiped out a jaw-dropping Rs 16 lakh crore in market value — the sharpest intraday collapse since June 2024. Inflation fears, a looming consumption crunch, and recession fears had investors running for cover as the Nifty and Sensex plunged deep into the red. India VIX — the fear gauge of the domestic market — soared as much as 66 percent to 22.85 on April 7, marking its sharpest intraday spike since June 4, 2024, according to Bloomberg data. The dramatic surge has completely erased the downtrend that had been in place since the latter half of January this year. ""The primary reason behind the selloff is the fear of a full-blown global trade war and its potential to tip the world economy into a recession. Countries including China, Canada, and the European Union have spoken about retaliatory tariffs on American goods, and the uncertainty around whether a settlement can be reached before the next phase of tariff hikes is causing widespread nervousness,"" Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Research and Wealth Management said in a conversation with Moneycontrol. Khemka advised against panic selling or making adventurous bets. Instead, he recommended a disciplined, long-term approach. Investors should use the correction to gradually accumulate fundamentally strong, domestically focused companies, particularly in consumption, financials, and banks. These areas are better positioned to weather global headwinds compared to globally exposed sectors like IT, pharma, and metals.

"Bloodbath on Wall Street: S&P500 enters bear market, Dow Jones down 1,300 pts amid trade war fears",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/bloodbath-on-wall-street-s-p500-enters-bear-market-dow-jones-down-1-300-pts-amid-trade-war-fears-12987804.html,"U.S. stocks plunged for a third straight session on Monday, with investors reeling from the fallout of the Trump administration’s aggressive tariff measures that have triggered a global market rout and fears of a deepening trade war. Coming off a brutal week, Monday’s losses added to the wreckage across equity markets. The Dow has now shed more than 1,200 points to trade 3 percent lower for three straight sessions— a historic first — including a staggering 2,231-point tumble on Friday. The S&P 500 lost 6 percent on the last day of the previous week, its sharpest single-day decline since the COVID crash in March 2020, wiping out 10 percent in just two sessions. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq has officially entered bear market territory, now down over 22 percent from its all-time high. Investors had hoped the weekend would bring some signs of moderation or talks following President Trump’s abrupt imposition of 10 percent tariffs on nearly all key U.S. trade partners, which kicked in on Saturday. Instead, the White House struck a combative tone. ""I don’t want anything to go down, but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something,"" Trump said in a Sunday evening statement. ""We’re losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year to China. Until we fix that, there won’t be a deal."" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick reaffirmed the administration’s firm stance, stating that the tariffs were ""definitely going to stay in place for days and weeks,"" quashing any hopes of a near-term reversal. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent echoed the message, adding that while over 50 countries have approached the U.S. for talks, resolving the issue won’t be quick. Canada and the European Union are reportedly preparing countermeasures as well, signalling a broadening of the standoff. Wall Street now fears the selloff could spiral further, as hedge funds and institutional investors are forced to liquidate positions to meet mounting margin calls. The CBOE Volatility Index — Wall Street’s so-called fear gauge — shot up to 50 early Monday, a level rarely seen outside of major bear markets. The ripple effects were felt far beyond U.S. shores. Bitcoin crashed below $77,000, oil prices tumbled under $60 per barrel to multi-year lows, and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong nosedived 13 percent in its steepest drop since 1997. Germany’s DAX also sank, falling as much as 10 percent during Monday’s session. Among the hardest-hit U.S. stocks were high-profile names like Tesla, down 6 percent in early trade, along with Caterpillar — a global construction bellwether — which shed 5 percent. Apple also saw a sharp 4 percent drop. If the S&P 500 closes down 4 percent or more on Monday, it would mark the third consecutive day of such a steep decline — something that hasn’t happened since the depths of the Great Depression in 1933. With the administration showing no signs of backing down and retaliatory measures mounting, traders are bracing for more pain in the days ahead — unless diplomacy steps in to cool things off. As for Indian markets, Dalal Street went into a freefall on April 7, as panic-selling took the benchmark indices sharply lower. Triggered by Donald Trump’s tariff tantrum on Wall Street, a wave of global jitters wiped out a jaw-dropping Rs 16 lakh crore in market value — the sharpest intraday collapse since June 2024.

All sectoral indices bore the brunt of the tariff tremors, with Nifty Metal and IT among the top laggards. ""Sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something,"" Trump said on his April 2 reciprocal tariffs that have since wiped trillions of dollars in company valuations.  Hindustan PetroleumCrude-sensitive companies bounced back from day's lows after Brent oil price fell about 4% to $63 per barrel, its lowest since April 2021. HPCL had recovered from day’s low, but succumbed in late trade on Centre's announcement to hike excise duty. Britannia (up by 0.65% at closing) BritanniaShares of the FMCG major gained during the market mayhem, with Nifty FMCG index emerging as the least-impacted index, with 3 out of 15 constituents in the positive. The relative outperformance of FMCG is attributed to their consumer-facing nature, which provides cushion during market volatility. Trent (down by 14.77% at closing) TrentShares of Trent fell sharply by about 18% after the promoter of Zudio and Westside apparel chains announced a weak Q4FY25 business update, showing Q4FY25 revenue was lower than estimate. Bajaj Housing (down by 2.86% at closing) Bajaj HousingEven after strong provisional numbers for the March quarter, a bearish market sentiment pulled the shares of Bajaj Housing lower by 6% in trade. April is a key month for the company as the shareholder lock-in period comes to an end, and according to Nuvama, over 64 percent of Bajaj Housing Finance’s outstanding equity — about 529 crore shares — will become eligible for trade. Tata Group Tata GroupAll Tata Group stocks dipped as a part of the 'Black Monday' market crash.

Bharat Petroleum (down by 1% at closing) Bharat PetroleumShares of BPCL ended in the red with losses, however, the stock rebounded by nearly 5 percent from its day’s lows. The fall in Brent crude is expected to benefit oil marketing companies as the decline in crude prices would lower their input costs. Delhivery (down by 3.69% at closing) DelhiveryOwing to acquisition of Ecom Express, Delhivery shares defy general market sentiment and leap 4%. Estimates predict further upward movement. Delhivery has formally announced its decision to acquire a rival firm, Ecom Express Limited, for a total sum of Rs 1,407 crore. Mazagaon (down by 8.39%) Mazagon Dock ShipbuildersThe shares of Mazagon crashed nearly 10 percent, marking a downgrade for a third continuous session, fuelled by government's plans to sell up to 4.83 percent stake in the PSU defence firm. Kotak Bank (down by 4.41% at closing) Nifty Bank indexThe banking index ended down more than 3 percent following US President Trump's slew of tariffs on multiple countries. Kotak Mahindra Bank shares were the top losers on the Nifty Bank index, tumbling over 4 percent."

Glenmark Pharma shares rally 15% to record high after mega licensing deal for its cancer drug,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/glenmark-pharma-shares-jump-10-to-record-high-after-mega-licensing-deal-for-its-cancer-drug-13265630.html,"The shares of Glenmark Pharma jumped 15 percent to hit a fresh 52-week high record on July 11. This comes after the company announced that its subsidiary has signed an exclusive global licensing agreement for its investigational asset ISB 2001 with New York-based AbbVie. In an exchange filing released in the post market hours of July 10, Glenmark announced that its step-down wholly-owned subsidiary, Ichnos Glenmark Innovation (IGI), has signed the agreement with AbbVie. ISB 2001 is currently in the first phase of clinical trials for patients suffering from relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, a type of cancer, the company said in an exchange filing. As part of the deal, AbbVie will get the exclusive right to develop, manufacture, and commercialise ISB 2001 across North America, Europe, Japan, and China. Glenmark will meanwhile develop, manufacture and lead commercialization of ISB 2001 across Emerging Markets including the rest of Asia, Latin America, the Russia/CIS region, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, New Zealand and South Korea. Glenmark's subsidiary will get an upfront payment of $700 million, and will be eligible to receive up to $1.225 billion in development, regulatory, and commercial milestone payments, along with tiered, double-digit royalties on net sales, as part of the deal. The pact was signed by IGI Therapeutics SA, a wholly owned subsidiary of Ichnos Glenmark Innovation, Inc., which is a subsidiary of Glenmark Pharmaceuticals. The US Food and Drug Administration had granted ISB 2001 orphan drug designation in July 2003 and fast-track designation in May for the treatment of relapsed or refractory myeloma patients. “Multispecifics including trispecific antibodies represent a new frontier in immuno-oncology with the potential to deliver deeper, more durable responses by engaging multiple targets simultaneously,” said Roopal Thakkar, M.D., Executive Vice-President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer, AbbVie. “This partnership with IGI reflects our unwavering commitment to advancing novel therapies for patients with multiple myeloma, a disease where significant unmet need remains despite recent progress,” Thakkar added. “ISB 2001 exemplifies the potential of our BEAT® protein platform to generate effective multispecificsTM that may overcome resistance and improve outcomes in hard-to-treat cancers,” said Cyril Konto, M.D., President and CEO of IGI. ""This agreement marks a defining milestone in IGI’s scientific journey and reflects our team’s deep commitment to delivering meaningful therapies for patients. Our partnership with AbbVie accelerates ISB 2001’s path to patients and sharpens our focus on advancing the next generation of BEAT®-enabled assets in oncology.” Glenmark Pharma shares have so far gained over 14 percent in the past five days, and more than 28 percent in the past one month. The stock gained nearly 40 percent in the past six months, and over 51 percent in the past one year. Nomura has kept a ''neutral' call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 1,500 per share. This implies a downside potential of more than 21 percent from the stock’s previous closing price of Rs 1,904 apiece. The brokerage said that the licensing deal is the largest by any Indian pharma company. The deal value has also beat its expectations.

Tata Elxsi stock falls 7% after weak Q1; brokerages turn bearish on growth outlook,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/tata-elxsi-stock-falls-7-after-weak-q1-brokerages-turn-bearish-on-growth-outlook-13264920.html,"Shares of Tata Elxsi slipped as much as 7 percent to Rs 5,660 in morning trade on Friday, July 11, after the company reported a sharp drop in June quarter earnings, triggering concerns over demand headwinds and margin pressure. The disappointing performance also prompted global brokerages to cut estimates and maintain bearish views on the stock. Morgan Stanley retained its Underweight rating with a target price of Rs 4,660, implying a downside potential of 24 percent from the last close on the NSE. The brokerage said the company missed expectations despite low investor forecasts. While management remained hopeful of a recovery led by auto and media verticals, analysts flagged that the stock has outperformed peers despite an ongoing earnings downgrade cycle. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates JPMorgan also reiterated an Underweight call, lowering its target to Rs 3,800. It highlighted that this was the fourth consecutive quarter of revenue and margin miss. The brokerage expects auto deal ramp-ups to be gradual and flagged lingering tariff-related uncertainty in the US market. It expects telecom to return to growth from Q2 but trimmed FY26–28 earnings estimates by 3–5 percent. Tata Elxsi posted a 22 percent year-on-year decline in net profit at Rs 144 crore for Q1FY26, compared to Rs 184 crore a year ago. Revenue fell 3.7 percent to Rs 892 crore, dragged by weakness in the automotive and transportation segment, which makes up over half its top line. EBITDA dropped 26 percent year-on-year to Rs 187 crore. CEO Manoj Raghavan said the quarter was marked by macro and client-specific challenges, impacting R&D spend and slowing decision cycles. Despite this, he said the company remains focused on large deal execution and building long-term customer relationships. At about 9:30 am, shares of the company were trading at Rs 5,880, lower by 4.4 percent from the last close on the NSE. Tata Elxsi shares are down nearly 10 percent since the beginning of the year.

"Glenmark’s R&D bet pays off handsomely with AbbVie deal, vindicating backer-in-chief Saldanha",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/glenmark-s-r-d-bet-pays-off-handsomely-with-abbvie-deal-vindicating-backer-in-chief-saldanha-13261705.html,"Glenmark Pharmaceuticals chairman and managing director Glenn Saldanha has secured one of the largest global licensing deals for an Indian-origin biotech asset, a high-risk bet that not only proved naysayers wrong but also seems to have paid off really well. ISB 2001, a cancer treatment developed by Glenmark’s US-based subsidiary Ichnos Glenmark Innovation has been licensed to AbbVie for $700 million upfront. IGI could earn up to $1.225 billion in additional milestone payments, according to the agreement, which needs regulatory approvals. “This is not just a Glenmark moment — it’s an India moment,” Saldanha told media on July 10 evening following the deal announcement. “We’ve gone through blood, sweat, and tears to get here. This validates everything we’ve built,” he said. Just a year ago, the company had to sell some assets to pare debt and clean up its balance sheet. Its cash-heavy model  didn’t sit too well with investors either. And then ISB 2001 happened. ISB 2001 targets relapsing multiple myeloma, a form of blood cancer that affects white blood cells. The drug has the potential to address a significant unmet need, especially in cases where patients have exhausted other lines of treatment. It is estimated that globally between 200,000 and 300,000 patients suffer from multiple myeloma. The milestone payments hinge on successful clinical trials such as completion of Phase 1, 2, and Phase 3, regulatory nods and commercial outcomes such as launches in specific markets, sales thresholds or market share. Globally, the ISB 2001 deal ranks third-largest in terms of upfront payment size for a multi-specific or bispecific asset in the last two years, placing it in elite company alongside two agreements involving China’s 3SBio licensing its PD-1 asset to Pfizer for $1.25 billion, with milestone payments potentially reaching $4.8 billion plus royalties on sales. The other is BioNTech – BMS licensing deal worth $11.1 billion, including upfront and milestone payments. High risk, high cash burn Glenmark's high-risk, high-cash-burn research and development model didn't resonate well with most Indian investors and analysts. The Mumbai-based firm has an impressive track record of building brands domestically and has a sizeable presence in the US and Europe. Nine of its brands, including Candid, Ascoril, and Telma, are among the top 300 in India by sales but the company has struggled with high debt and sub-20 EBITDA margins, way below the industry standard. It had to sell some good assets, including its API business to Nirma in March 2024, which allowed the company to clean up the balance sheet, lowering the net debt to around Rs 400 crore. ""The challenge with India has always been that the capital markets are always short-term focused. So, there's always pressure on showing higher margins, getting better valuation, getting better market cap. And that's contrary to spending in innovation.” Saldanha said. “Innovation is the long gestation period capital that you're putting aside every year, with a view that something will culminate down the road.” What’s different this time? ISB 2001, developed using IGI’s proprietary BEAT multispecific antibody platform, targets BCMA and CD38 on myeloma cells and CD3 on T cells. It showed a 79 percent overall response rate and 30 percent complete response in heavily pre-treated multiple myeloma patients in Phase 1 trials, earning Orphan Drug Designation and Fast Track status from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Unlike previous efforts, Glenmark focused its resources on a single, high-potential asset. “We shut down other programmes and bet big on ISB 2001,” said Saldanha. “All it takes is one asset to transform a company — just look at Keytruda.” He was referring to American drug firm Merck’s Keytruda (pembrolizumab), which is the top selling cancer drug globally, generating $29.5 billion in sales in 2024 alone. Behind the scenes The work on licensing deal between IGI and AbbVie for ISB 2001 began in earnest in January 2025 during the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference — the global event for biotech dealmaking. Following the presentation of promising Phase 1 data at American Society of Hematology (ASH) in late 2024, IGI scouting for potential partners. Compelling clinical data — a 79 percent overall response rate and 30 percent complete response —sparked interest among several global pharma companies. Negotiations with AbbVie intensified after the ASCO 2025 presentation, which further validated ISB 2001’s efficacy and safety profile. Over the next six months, IGI and AbbVie engaged in rigorous due diligence, contracting, and strategic discussions, culminating into licensing deal. What next? AbbVie will now lead global development and commercialisation in North America, Europe, Japan, and Greater China. Glenmark retains rights for Emerging Markets, including India, Latin America, and Africa. The molecule remains in Phase 1 dose expansion, with commercialisation expected in four to five years, subject to regulatory progress. Glenmark will remain deeply involved through joint committees and retain commercial rights in key geographies, Saldanha said. “It’s a partnership not a hands-off,” he said. The Rs 6,000 crore upfront payment will make IGI self-funded for at least three years, reducing pressure to launch  IPO immediately. “We’ll time the IGI IPO based on market conditions,” Saldanha noted. “But we’re now debt-free and have the flexibility to reward shareholders.” While no acquisitions are planned yet, Glenmark will continue investing in innovation. “We’re not stepping away from R&D. We’ll do globally relevant work,” he said. Beyond ISB 2001 IGI’s pipeline includes ISB 2301, another multi-specific antibody targeting NK cells, which is expected to enter clinical trials next year. Two monoclonal antibody programmes in dermatology are also partnered and progressing. “We’re building a portfolio, not just a one-hit wonder,” said Saldanha. “We’ve always believed in moving up the value chain,” said Saldanha. “This is just the beginning.”"
"Sensex, Nifty eye weak start as Trump tariff jitters resurface; key levels to track on July 11",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sensex-nifty-eye-weak-start-as-trump-tariff-jitters-resurface-key-levels-to-track-on-july-11-13264639.html,"Benchmark indices Nifty and Sensex are set for a weak start on July 11, likely extending their losing streak to a third straight session, after fresh tariff threats from US President Donald Trump rattled global sentiment. Trump announced a 35 percent tariff on Canadian imports starting August 1 and hinted at blanket duties of 15 to 20 percent on most trade partners, reigniting fears of a global trade war. At approximately 7:55 a.m., the GIFT Nifty was trading at 25,283, down 127 points or 0.5 per cent. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates In the previous session, equity indices were weighed down by heightened volatility typical of the weekly derivatives expiry. On the sectoral front, the Nifty IT index emerged as the biggest drag, with heavyweights such as Infosys, Wipro, TCS, and Tech Mahindra slipping. Analysts warned that the IT sector may witness a tepid earnings season. On July 10, both Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) and domestic institutional investors (DIIs) were net buyers. DIIs net bought Rs 221 crore in Indian equities while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) net bought Rs 591 crore, according to provisional data on NSE. Here are the key levels to watch out for in today's session The 25,300 level is now a crucial make-or-break point; a sustained close below this could further weaken the chart structure. On the flip side, the 25,550–25,600 zone continues to attract selling pressure, marking a critical resistance area that needs to be crossed for any sustainable up move. Additionally, Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) are aggressively increasing their short positions in index futures, indicating caution from institutional participants. Until there's evidence of short covering or long buildup by FPIs, upside momentum is expected to remain limited. ""A firm hurdle has formed near 57,350, where selling pressure has repeatedly emerged. Unless the index closes above this resistance zone, a sustained bullish reversal appears unlikely,"" says Dhupesh Dhameja of SAMCO Securities. ""Price action remains indecisive, oscillating between the 10-day and 20-day EMAs. The index continues to consolidate within a narrow 500-point band (56,800–57,300), with muted institutional participation. A close below the key support at 56,770 could weaken the structure further, while a sustained move above 57,350 is needed to signal strength. Adding to the cautious outlook, FPIs have been consistently short on index futures, pointing to persistent supply pressure at higher levels,"" he added. India VIX slipped 2.24 percent to close at 11.67, remaining well below the psychological mark of 15. This low-volatility regime points to muted investor fear and favours a slow, grinding market rather than volatile price swings. However, it also reflects indecision and a lack of strong directional conviction. The Put-Call Ratio (PCR) remained steady at 0.69, underscoring a bearish tilt due to elevated call writing.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade JSW Energy, Prestige Estates, Ingersoll Rand, Premier Energies, EID Parry, Adani Power and others on July 11?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-jsw-energy-prestige-estates-ingersoll-rand-premier-energies-eid-parry-adani-power-and-others-on-july-11-13261558.html,"Equity benchmarks saw a consolidation breakout on the lower side, falling nearly half a percent on July 10, with breadth consistently favouring bears. A total of 1,443 shares saw a correction compared to 1,196 shares that gained on the NSE. The market is expected to see further consolidation with a negative bias in the upcoming sessions. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Mandar Bhojane, Senior Equity Research Analyst at Choice Broking Prestige Estates Projects | CMP: Rs 1,696.5  Prestige Estates Projects has recently formed a Cup and Handle pattern on the daily chart with strong volume participation, indicating rising bullish interest. A decisive close above Rs 1,750 would confirm the pattern breakout and could open up a fresh upside rally. The immediate support is placed at Rs 1,640, making it a strong accumulation zone for traders looking to enter on dips. The RSI stands at 61.15 and is trending upward, reflecting improving momentum and increasing buying pressure. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,000, Rs 2,100 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,580 Sterling and Wilson Renewable Energy | CMP: Rs 336.55  Sterling and Wilson Renewable Energy saw a decisive breakout from a Cup and Handle formation on the daily chart. The move, backed by a noticeable rise in volumes, suggests that bulls are regaining control and a trend shift may already be underway. Momentum is building, with the RSI at 65.9, trending upward and reflecting growing strength without entering overbought territory. The Rs 320 level stands out as a strong base and could act as a buy-on-dips zone. With the price holding above the breakout zone, sustained momentum could lead to targets of Rs 400 and Rs 420 in the short term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 400, Rs 420 Stop-Loss: Rs 310 Jay Mehta, Technical Research at JM Financial Services IndiaMart InterMesh | CMP: Rs 2,586.2  IndiaMart InterMesh has formed an inverse Head-and-Shoulders pattern on the daily chart—a bullish reversal pattern—and it has already given a breakout above the pattern. On June 25, the stock formed a bullish gap, and it is currently retesting this gap while finding support at the 20-day EMA, indicating potential for a continuation of the upward trend. A move above Rs 2,661 could accelerate the bullish momentum. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,750, Rs 2,980 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,387 Ingersoll Rand (India) | CMP: Rs 4,178.9  Ingersoll Rand (India) has broken above a trendline resistance in place since the high of November 26, 2024. After three unsuccessful attempts this week, marked by consolidative spinning top candlestick patterns, it achieved a breakout today with positive volume confirmation, signaling potential for further upside. Momentum indicators are exhibiting strong bullish strength. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 4,350, Rs 4,450 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,990 JSW Energy | CMP: Rs 530.55  JSW Energy has broken out of a triangular consolidation pattern on the daily chart, accompanied by a surge in positive volume. The stock has found support near its 20-day and 50-day EMAs, confirming bullish strength. A move above Rs 545 could further fuel the upward momentum. The momentum indicator is in a bullish zone, with a positive crossover signaling growing bullish strength. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 578, Rs 600 Stop-Loss: Rs 509 Dhupesh Dhameja, Derivatives Research Analyst at Samco Securities Premier Energies | CMP: Rs 1,115.8  Premier Energies is on the verge of a breakout from a classic Cup and Handle formation, signaling a potential reversal of its prior downtrend and laying the groundwork for the next leg of upward momentum. The pattern is accompanied by a notable surge in volumes, confirming the breakout. Interestingly, volume participation remained muted during the pattern formation—an ideal setup often seen before a sharp price-volume expansion—which now reflects renewed investor interest. The stock is trading firmly above its 20-day EMA, and the daily RSI has climbed above 60, reinforcing the bullish momentum. These technical indicators suggest growing strength and support the likelihood of a sustained rally. Traders may consider initiating long positions at the current market price or on dips toward Rs 1,105. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,255 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,030 EID Parry India | CMP: Rs 1,109.8  EID Parry India is displaying impressive relative strength, outperforming the benchmark index and trading near its record high. The stock has confirmed a breakout from a classic Flag and Pole continuation pattern, signaling the potential for a further rally into uncharted territory. The breakout is validated by a sharp surge in trading volumes following a period of subdued activity during the pattern formation—an ideal setup that often precedes significant price expansion. This volume-price action suggests renewed buying interest and strengthening bullish sentiment. Technically, the stock is comfortably trading above its upward-sloping 20-day EMA, while the daily RSI continues to hold above the 60 mark, reinforcing the ongoing momentum and increasing the probability of sustained upside. Traders may consider entering long positions at the current market price or on dips toward Rs 1,095. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,200 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,054 Adani Power | CMP: Rs 605.8  Adani Power has decisively broken out of an ascending triangle pattern, marking a key technical shift as the stock exits its accumulation phase and trades well above its neckline. This breakout also signals early signs of a reversal from its prolonged downtrend, suggesting the potential beginning of a fresh markup phase. The move is backed by a notable surge in trading volumes, following a period of subdued participation during the pattern formation—a classic setup that often precedes sharp price expansion. The strong volume confirms renewed buying interest and builds a solid foundation for sustained upward momentum. From a technical perspective, the daily RSI has sustained above the 60 mark for the first time in nearly a year, further validating the bullish reversal and increasing confidence in a continued rally. The stock is now well-positioned for a strong uptrend in the sessions ahead. Traders may consider initiating long positions at the current market price or on dips toward Rs 598.

SEBI fines Aqua Proof Rs 45 lakh for front-running KPIT Tech trades,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sebi-fines-aqua-proof-rs-45-lakh-for-front-running-kpit-tech-trades-13261169.html,"The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has penalised Aqua Proof Wall Plast Private Limited (APWPPL) and its director Naresh Chandra Bohra for front-running trades in the shares of KPIT Technologies Ltd. SEBI has imposed a fine of Rs 40 lakh on APWPPL and Rs 5 lakh on Bohra for the violation. The regulator found that APWPPL made illegal gains of Rs 19.52 lakh in 2017 by executing trades ahead of a large client’s order, a practice known as front-running, which is banned in India. SEBI did not estimate the exact investor losses but warned that such activity distorts market prices, erodes investor trust, and causes financial harm to large clients who get poorer execution rates. The trades in question were originally done by Mehrangarh Financial Advisors Pvt Ltd (MFAPL), which later merged with APWPPL. The firm allegedly traded KPIT Technologies shares on July 26, 2017, based on non-public client information accessed through Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers. Here’s how it played out: MFAPL sold shares at around Rs 123.73, just before the big client placed its sell order. As soon as the client’s order hit the market and prices dropped, MFAPL bought the shares back at around Rs 120.20. The company made a profit of Rs 3.53 per share on 5.52 lakh shares in a single day. SEBI concluded that the firm had used privileged information to gain an unfair advantage in the market.

At close, the Sensex was down 345.80 points or 0.41 percent at 83,190.28, and the Nifty was down 120.85 points or 0.47 percent at 25,355.25. Nifty Midcap and smallcap indices shed 0.3 percent each. Except metal, realty, all other indices ended lower with pharma, telecom, IT, PSU Bank, FMCG down 0.5 percent each. IT stocks were cautious ahead of TCS Q1 results. Bharti Airtel, HDFC Life, Asian Paints, Apollo Hospitals, Shriram Finance were among major losers on the Nifty, while gainers were IndusInd Bank, Maruti Suzuki, Tata Steel, Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv.

Click to View More Outlook for July 11 Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities Nifty slipped lower following a breakdown from the congestion zone on the daily chart, reinforcing the prevailing bearish sentiment. Additionally, the index has moved below the 21-hour exponential moving average. The RSI (14) on the daily chart has also turned negative, indicating weakening momentum. In the short term, the trend is likely to remain weak, which could lead to further downside. On the lower end, support is placed at 25,250–25,200, while on the higher end, resistance levels are seen at 25,400 and 25,500. Aditya Gaggar Director of Progressive Shares Today's trade was dominated by bears. After a muted start, the market witnessed a one-sided move toward the south, ultimately ending the session at 25,355.25 with a notable loss of 120.85 points. Except for the Realty and Metal, all other sectors closed in negative territory, with IT and PSU Banking being the major laggards. The broader markets outperformed the Frontline Index, as the Midcap and Smallcap segments managed to restrict their corrections. Over the past few sessions, the level of 25,400 had acted as a strong support; however, it was breached in today’s trade, though a confirmatory move is required. If the downward momentum continues, the correction could extend further toward the 25,200 mark, while resistance is now seen lower at 25,520. Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets edged lower and lost nearly half a percent on the weekly expiry day. After a flat start, the Nifty gradually drifted lower as the session progressed and finally settled near the day’s low, around the 25,355.25 mark. On the sectoral front, profit booking in IT majors ahead of TCS results weighed on the index, followed closely by weakness in FMCG and pharma stocks. However, the realty and metal sectors bucked the trend and closed in the green. The broader indices also ended with modest losses, continuing their profit-taking phase. Markets will react to TCS’s earnings in early trade, with a keen eye on management commentary, which could set the initial tone. With the Nifty now hovering near its immediate and crucial support zone—marked by the 20-day exponential moving average (20-DEMA) and the upper boundary of its previous consolidation range around the 25,200–25,300 zone—it will be critical for the index to hold this level to maintain its positive bias. That said, with the earnings season underway, stock-specific opportunities are likely to emerge on both sides, so participants should align their positions accordingly.

The subdued mood also reflected a lack of fresh triggers, as investors awaited the start of the June-quarter earnings season with TCS’s results and monitored progress on the long-pending India–US trade deal. At the close, the Sensex was down 345.80 points or 0.41 percent at 83,190.28, and the Nifty was down 120.85 points or 0.47 percent at 25,355.25.

Volatility remained subdued as India VIX declined over 2 percent to 11.68. Looking ahead, Manish Sonthalia, Director & CIO at Emkay Investment Managers, maintained a positive medium-term view despite near-term volatility, describing it as “unequivocally a buy-on-dips market.” “I believe investors who buy into this dip will benefit from tailwinds expected in Q3 and Q4. We see Nifty 50 earnings growth in Q1FY26 at around 3–8 percent. While markets could overshoot on the upside, this volatility is an opportunity to accumulate select stocks,” he said. On the technical side, Vaishali Parekh, VP – Technical Research at Prabhudas Lilladher Capital, noted that volatility could intensify as the results season unfolds. “The index has strong support in the 25,250–25,300 zone, which needs to hold. On the upside, a decisive break above 25,650 could trigger a fresh rally, opening the path to targets of 25,700 and 26,200 in the coming sessions,” she added. Maruti Suzuki, IndusInd Bank, Tata Steel, Bajaj Finance, and Bajaj Finserv were the top gainers on the Nifty. Laggards on the index included Bharti Airtel, Asian Paints, HDFC Life, Apollo Hospitals, and Shriram Finance.

"IPO-bound Anthem Bio says cost arbitrage drove expansion, proposing China alternative for global pharma",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/ipo-bound-anthem-bio-says-cost-arbitrage-drove-expansion-proposing-china-alternate-for-global-pharma-13257667.html,"IPO-bound Anthem Biosciences, a Bengaluru-based contract research development and manufacturing firm (CRDMO), will be the second such player to debut on stock exchanges in less than a year, and has positioned itself as a key alternative to global biotech and pharma majors in diversifying their supply chains. The management told Moneycontrol that it is now the second source for many Chinese products, and one of the fastest-growing CRDMOs in India. “We’re now the second source for many products made in China, and the first choice for new ones,” Ajay Bhardwaj, CEO and Founder of Anthem told Moneycontrol in an interview. Anthem’s IPO, opening on July 14, is a pure offer-for-sale of Rs 3,395 crore in which the private equity investor True North will be offloading shares along with promoters trimming stakes slightly. Post-listing, promoter holding will remain above 74%. In December, Hyderabad-based Sai Life Sciences had completed a successful IPO - oversubscribed more than ten times - with institutional investors showing strong interest, betting on the sector's tailwinds. Since then, Sai Life has gained around 19% from its listing price of Rs 660 per share to trade near Rs 784.90 on BSE on July 10. The supply chain diversification by global pharma, in addition to India’s scientific capabilities and cost arbitrage, made Anthem the fastest-growing CRDMO with revenue growing at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 24.8% and EBITDA growth of almost 30% in the last five financial years. The company ended FY25 with revenue of Rs 1844.6 crore and an EBITDA margin of 36.8%. Among CRDMOs, Divi’s Laboratories led the pack with revenue of Rs 9,360 crore, and an EBITDA margin of 31.7% with a net profit of Rs 2,191 crore in FY25. Divi’s was followed by Syngene International with a revenue of Rs 3,642 crore, EBITDA margin of 29% and a net profit of Rs 496 crore. Sai Life Sciences recorded revenue of Rs 1,642 crore, an EBITDA margin of 24%, and net profit of Rs 173 crore and Cohance Lifesciences posted revenue of Rs 1,198 crore, an EBITDA margin of 31.3%, and net profit of Rs 265 crore. Divi’s and Cohance’s revenues also comes from active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) manufacturing, along with CDMO. How Did it all Start? Anthem Biosciences began its journey in 2006, with Ajay Bhardwaj, Ganesh Sambasivam, and K Ravindra Chandrappa as founders, who were all colleagues at Biocon and its subsidiary Syngene. Bhardwaj, while leaving Biocon in 2006, had a chance conversation with Dinesh (a colleague from Syngene) which sparked the idea of starting a company. Bhardwaj recollects their vision was to build a ‘company that does things differently, instead of replicating products or clients’ from previous pharma employers.""We targetted small biotech firms that were under-served by larger CRDMOs, offering a fee-for-service (FFS) model - where clients pay only upon delivery - rather than the traditional full-time equivalent (FTE) model where clients are billed on the number of work hours,"" Bhardwaj said. Its early bet on combining synthetic chemistry with fermentation and enzymatic processes paid off, enabling it to lead in complex modalities like peptides, ADCs, and oligonucleotides. Capacity Expansion While global pharma companies are jittery about outsourcing research and manufacturing of their prized assets to Chinese CRDMOs due to potential data or intellectual property (IP) breaches - in addition to supply chain disruptions and uncertainties of trade war – yet Chinese CRDMOs score over Indian companies in terms of capacity and execution speed, industry executives have said. Bhardwaj said Anthem is attempting to meet this demand and is expanding aggressively with a capex investment of Rs 451.4 crore. The Unit III (NeoAnthem) is operational, and the unit IV is under construction on a 30-acre site at Harohalli, Karnataka, which will support both small and large molecule programs. Anthem’s proposed Unit V is planned in Hosur. By FY26, the company’s fermentation capacity is expected to reach 182 KL, and custom synthesis at 425 KL. The company said it is sitting on a net cash of Rs 622.8 crore to fund this expansion. Anthem’s client base includes more than 550 pharma and biotech firms, with top 5 customers contributing 70% of revenue, point towards concentration risk. “These are sticky relationships,” CFO Mohammed Gawir Baig said. “We’re embedded in their filings, their IP, their future.” More than half of Anthem revenue comes from US, followed by Europe, India and rest of Asia. The company’s facilities have passed multiple USFDA, PMDA, and TGA inspections with zero observations."

"FMCG volume growth seen soft, early monsoon dented demand for summer-related products, says Axis Securities",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/fmcg-volume-growth-seen-soft-early-monsoon-dented-demand-for-summer-related-products-says-axis-securities-13258136.html,"The FMCG volume growth for the June quarter is expected to stay soft, as was the trend during the fourth quarter for the last fiscal, with rural India outperforming urban areas due to demand weakness, Axis Securities said in a note ahead of the earnings season, adding that early rains have hurt some of the summer season sales. Consumer companies also face stiff regional competition, a rising trend of D2C brands and inventory pressures in trade channels, which has been worsened by a summer season sale that has been largely muted, the note said. ""Summer-reliant categories such as beverages, ice cream, and talcum powder are likely to witness pressure this quarter,"" the note added, underscoring the impact of unseasonal rain and early monsoon. The note said investors can hope for a recovery in demand and consumer sentiment in the second half of the fiscal. ""Looking ahead, growth momentum is expected to be supported by monetary policy easing, income tax benefits, a healthy monsoon outlook, and government measures aimed at boosting disposable incomes, which could uplift consumer sentiment and drive demand recovery by H2FY26,"" said Axis Securities. Not just volumes, even margins could stay subdued during the June quarter earnings, owing to 'elevated raw material inventory costs and subdued operating leverage', however, easing input prices could provide margin relief from Q2FY26 onward, said the Axis note. In this context, the note has underscored Britannia and DOMS Industries to outperform peers in the FMCG pack in the June quarter earnings, while Trent and D-Mart could do well in the retail space. This is likely on account of a recovery in smaller towns which could help value retailers such as D-Mart while premium retailers like Trent and Ethos are expected to maintain growth momentum. Axis Securities said it expects Britannia to report 8% YoY revenue growth along with a 5% volume growth during the June quarter. Investors should also watch out for the effectiveness of recent price hikes, a crucial factor which will need to be monitored in the coming quarters.

"Bharat Dynamics, GRSE, HAL, other defence stocks decline up to 3%: Here are the likely triggers",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/bharat-dynamics-grse-hal-other-defence-stocks-decline-up-to-3-here-are-the-likely-triggers-13257810.html,"Defence stocks tumbled in trade today, buoyed by several factors. The sharp fall in the share prices pushed the Nifty India Defence index down nearly 1.4 percent to hover around 8,739 in the morning. After a significant rally, defence stocks have seen significant volatility recently. While geopolitical tensions around the globe fuel the sentiment, analysts flag elevated valuations and lack of fresh triggers. Motilal Oswal gives 'Neutral' rating to BDL shares Bharat Dynamics (BDL) shares were the top loser on the index, dropping over 3 percent to trade at Rs 1,917 apiece. This comes after Motilal Oswal Financial Services initiated coverage on the stock with a 'Neutral' rating and a target price of Rs 1,900 apiece. This implies a downside potential of more than 4 percent from the stock's previous closing price of Rs 1,985 apiece. ""We like the business model of BDL and its ability to scale up its revenues and order book in current scenario, however, with fair valuations, we would look for lower price points to enter the stock,"" the brokerage said. It expects the firm's revenue growth to rebound and benefit from emergency procurement pipeline. Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers (GRSE) shares followed, dropping over 3 percent to trade at Rs 2,890 apiece. While the stock has dropped nearly 11 percent in the past one month, it has rallied over 96 percent in the past six months. Data Patterns and Zen Technologies shares plunged over 2 percent each, while Solar Industries, Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) and Cochin Shipyard shares declined over 2 percent each. Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders, Bharat Electronics (BEL) and Paras Defence shares were down over 0.6 percent, while those of BEML were trading in the red with marginal losses. Concerns over elevated valuations The defence stocks have been in focus on hopes of higher order inflows, after the Indian military conducted targeted strikes against terrorist outfits in Pakistan under the codename 'Operation Sindoor' in May. As the geopolitical tensions between India and Pakistan eased, the escalations in Russia-Ukraine war continued to support the rally in defence stocks. The rise in tensions between Israel and Iran further boosted the stocks. However, analysts have mixed views regarding the space, with some flagging elevated valuations in these stocks. Easing geopolitical tensions The fall in the defence stocks also comes on the back of overall easing geopolitical tensions. US President Donald Trump had hinted at a possible Gaza ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas this week. This comes amid Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s visit to US. Earlier, the easing tensions between Iran and Israel after significant escalations in the oil-rich middle east, had pushed down the stocks. Profit booking after record rally Defence stocks may have also dropped as investors booked profits at elevated levels. The stocks have seen significant surge in 2025 so far. BDL shares have gained over 69 percent this year, while those of jumped 75 percent. HAL shares are up 19 percent while Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders shares are up nearly 46 percent.

Over the past several years, JKCE has evolved into a structurally stronger business, outperforming peers. The company has a robust pipeline and aims to expand its capacity to 50mtpa by FY30.

"Jane Street unlikely to get any immediate relief against SEBI order, say legal experts",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/jane-street-unlikely-to-get-any-immediate-relief-against-sebi-order-say-legal-experts-13257718.html,"Global high frequency trading major Jane Street, which is planning to challenge the SEBI order banning it from the Indian markets, is unlikely to get an immediate relief though an appeal could lead to a time bound final order being passed by the regulator, say legal experts. Lawyers specialising in securities market matters further add that since the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has passed an interim order, the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) could, without providing any kind of stay order, direct the regulator to pass a final order within a specified period. SAT is the designated tribunal to appeal against orders issued by the capital market regulator. “At the appeal stage, the first outcome could be a direction to SEBI for a time bound disposal in the form of a final order,” said Jayesh H, co-founder, Juris Corp Advocates & Solicitors. “It is highly unlikely that the order is completely set aside as even the Supreme Court has ruled that SEBI has powers to issue interim ex-parte orders in instances where there is market wide ramifications and irrevocable damage could be done if SEBI were to not issue such orders,” he added. Also Read: Jane Street leveraged India entity to breach FPI rules, powering trading strategy for alleged illicit gains In an order issued on Friday last week, SEBI banned Jane Street and its India arms from trading in Indian securities, and sought to impound Rs 4,843.5 crore in alleged unlawful gains linked to expiry-day manipulation using cash and futures trades to distort options pricing. As per SEBI, Jane Street made a profit of Rs 36,671 crore between January 2023 and March 2025. “Matters related to market manipulation are tricky ones and at this stage, SEBI only has to show ‘enough’ to convince the tribunal that something wrong has happened and it is working towards final disposal of the matter,” said another lawyer on conditions of anonymity. “There have been instances in the past when SAT has directed SEBI to issue a final order while giving a specified period of time and also giving the affected party an opportunity to present their case in front of the regulator. It is highly likely that the same logic would be applied to this matter as well,” he added. Incidentally, SEBI in its order has emphasised on the allegations related to market manipulation and fraudulent trades. The order states that Jane Street resorted to undertaking prima facie manipulative ‘extended marking the close’ trading pattern on the index and constituent stocks towards the close on expiry day, so as to influence and manipulate the index for illegal advantage. Also Read: Criminal prosecution against Jane Street? Sebi Act empowers watchdog to seek fine and imprisonment of up to 10 years Meanwhile, Sumit Agrawal, Founder, Regstreet Law Advisors and a former legal officer of SEBI, is of the view that while the interim order is rich in detail and reflects SEBI’s broader concerns about trading behaviour around derivatives expiry, the legal threshold for proving market manipulation under Indian law is quite high. “The order leans significantly on circumstantial indicators like timing and market impact, but absent clear evidence of intent or artificial price creation, those arguments may not be legally decisive,” says Agrawal. Jane Street, on its part, has already disputed the allegations in SEBI’s interim order, and has communicated to its staff that it will challenge the regulatory ban. In a communique to its employees, it said that the trades under question were “basic index arbitrage trading”, adding that it was “beyond disappointed” by what it called “extremely inflammatory” accusations by SEBI, and is working on a formal response. “Jane Street may argue that its actions formed part of a legitimate, rule-based trading model designed for hedging or liquidity management. It could also point to the transparent execution of trades via the exchange, and stress the lack of intent to mislead or cause artificial price movement. Additionally, there may be questions raised about procedural fairness, given the ex-parte nature of the order,” said Agrawal while adding that if the global high frequency trading major can establish that the trading was lawful and not intended to distort the market, relief from SAT is certainly within the realm of possibility.

TCS shares trade flat ahead of Q1 results: What to expect?,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/tcs-shares-trade-flat-ahead-of-q1-results-what-to-expect-13257162.html,"The shares of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) were trading flat on July 10, ahead of the firm's Q1 FY26 results announcement, which will effectively open the earnings season for the IT pack. The shares of the IT major were trading with minor gains and losses in the morning. At 10.30 am, the stock was up 0.02 percent to hover around Rs 3,384 apiece. The company is set to release its results for the April-June quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026 in the post market hours of July 10. While intimating stock exchanges about the same, the company had said that its board will meet on July 10 to consider and approve the results and a dividend. TCS shareholders eye dividend announcement; record date announced: The record date to determine the eligibility of the shareholders set to receive the possible dividend has been set at July 16. ""The interim dividend, if declared, shall be paid to the equity shareholders of the Company whose names appear on the Register of Members of the Company or in the records of the Depositories as beneficial owners of the shares as on Wednesday, July 16, 2025, which is the Record Date fixed for the purpose,"" the company said. What to expect from TCS Q1 results? Analysts have suggested that the IT sector may see a soft earnings season, amid global uncertainties. ""If the final U.S. tariffs are pushed on the consumer, U.S. inflation will rise, which is injecting continued uncertainty for global corporations and could drag growth in IT,"" said Girish Pai, analyst at BOBCAPS. Equirius Capital expects TCS' US revenue to dip sequentially by 0.4 percent in CC terms. It noted that tepid growth will largely be driven by expected ramp down in BSNL deal and some softness in sales growth in international markets. The firm expects EBIT margins to improve marginally as soft demand will likely result into lower operating. ""Equirus expects material dip in TCV QoQ given seasonal softness,"" it added. ICICI Securities has projected TCS to report a decline of 3.4 percent CC, ""led by $300 million quarterly ramp-down from BSNL deal, partly offset by resilient growth in international markets led by BFSI"". Axis Securities expects TCS revenue to fall 0.3 percent sequentially in Q1, driven by the impact from BSNL deal. ""EBIT margin to remain flattish by 60 bps during the quarter,"" it said. Ashika Institutional Equity Research expects TCS to report a sequential decline of 0.5 percent in USD revenue, amid the likely revenue impact of the BSNL deal ramp down. What to watch out for in TCS Q1 results? The key things to watch out for in TCS quarterly show include demand outlook in BFSI, retail, communication, hi-tech and other key segments, as well as any impact of volatile macro environment and tariff issues on demand. The firm's deal pipeline, outlook on CY25E/FY26E IT budgets, any further update on growth strategies as well as possible wage hike and new deal with BSNL will be in focus. TCS share price history TCS shares have dropped over 2 percent in the past one month, and nearly 21 percent in the past six months. The stock is down around 18 percent in 2025 so far. The sharp fall came on the back of global uncertainties, buoyed by US President Donald Trump's tariff flip flops. The stock, which is a notable constituent of benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty 50, currently has a P/E ratio of over 25.

Moneycontrol reported citing sources that the under-recovery will be funded through the proceeds of excise duty hikes, and will be channelled via the Consolidated Fund of India. The Finance Ministry is finalizing the contours of the deal, and a Cabinet approval for the compensation could be sought soon, it is learnt. Sources also told Moneycontrol that the Finance Ministry has agreed to this proposed fund that be to the tune of Rs 32,000-35,000 crore, though this is lower than the Petroleum Ministry's initial demand of Rs 40,000 crore. In April this year, domestic LPG prices were raised by Rs 50 per cylinder, which resulted in a decrease in under-recoveries. OMCs have been hopeful in recent quarters about some mechanism to address the rising LPG recoveries. ""We are hopeful some mechanism definitely because after increase of Rs 50, now the under-recovery has come down every month, we are expecting around Rs 650-700 crore per month for BPCL. And we are hopeful some mechanism will be put in place so that maybe on a quarterly basis, we can get the reimbursement, whatever under recovery,"" VRK Gupta, Dir - Finance at BPCL had said in May 2025.

HPCL has absorbed almost Rs 10,900 crore of LPG under recovery, the company said in May 2025, but after the government raised prices of LPG by Rs 50, the under-recovery came down to around Rs 165-170 per cylinder for the company. The Centre has in the past said that the excise duty hike on petrol and diesel would be used for payment of the LPG under-recovery."

"Vedanta, Hindustan Zinc shares extend losses to 2nd day after short-seller's report; group's base metal CEO quits",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/vedanta-hindustan-zinc-shares-in-green-after-group-denies-viceroy-research-s-ponzi-scheme-allegations-13256788.html,"The shares of Vedanta were trading in the red on July 10, a day after the stock crashed over 8 percent intraday following American short-seller Viceroy Research's allegations regarding its parent company. The shares of the company were down nearly 1.5 percent to hover around Rs 434.30 apiece, as seen at 11.34 am. US-based short seller Viceroy Research on July 9 said that it has taken a short position on the debt of Vedanta Resources, saying that it resembles a 'Ponzi scheme'. It called the parent company of Vedanta a ""parasite holding company with no significant operations of its own, propped up entirely by cash extracted from its dying host, Vedanta Limited"". Anil Agarwal-owned mining conglomerate is systematically draining Vedanta to service its own debt, Viceroy further said. ""VRL's actions to meet its short-term obligations directly impair its creditors’ long-term ability to recover their principal, a situation that resembles a Ponzi scheme where Vedanta stakeholders, which include VRL creditors, are the 'suckers',"" it added. Vedanta shares had crashed over 8 percent intraday on July 9 after the report was published. The stock later made some recovery to close 3 percent lower. The recovery was fuelled after Vedanta issued a clarification, strongly denying the claims. ""Viceroy Research report is a malicious combination of selective misinformation and baseless allegations to discredit the Group,"" Vedanta said in a stock exchange filing. ""It has been issued without making any attempt to contact us with the sole objective creating false propaganda. It only contains compilation of various information - which is already in the public domain, but the authors have tried to sensationalise the context to profiteer from market reaction,"" added Vedanta. ""The timing of the report is suspect and could be to undermine the forthcoming corporate initiatives. Our stakeholders are discerning enough to understand such tactics. In fact, to avoid any responsibility – authors of the report have added various disclaimers that the report has been prepared for educational purposes only and expresses their opinions and are not statements of fact,” the company further said. Notably, Vedanta is set to hold its Annual General Meeting (AGM) later today. Investors will actively await Chairman Anil Agarwal's speech, which may address the short-seller's allegations. Hindustan Zinc shares were also trading in the red, after seeing a strong downturn yesterday. The American short-seller had alleged that Hindustan Zinc's resources are being ""looted"" through related-party deals with promoter-family owned companies and unjustifiable brand fees. ""Vedanta's crown jewel may be its biggest liability,"" it said while speaking about Hindustan Zinc. Also read: Our LIVE blog on stock market updates Chris Griffith, the CEO of the base metals business of Vedanta Resources, has left the mining firm in recent days, Bloomberg reported. He was in charge of some of Vedanta's key assets like zinc mines in South Africa and neighboring Namibia. He was also the President of the firm's international business. Moneycontrol couldn't independently verify the report. Debt doesn't seem to be a challenge for Vedanta, and all its entities are self-sufficient, said Rakesh Arora, Managing Partner at Go India Advisors. Speaking to CNBC-TV18, Arora noted that the lenders wouldn't have approved the company's demerger if debt was a problem. ""Viceroy is two years late on Vedanta. The claims don't hold any ground now. I don't think there is fundamentally any any issue in Vedanta,"" he further told the publication. ""Vedanta has done phenomenally well in the last two-three years, and things will only get better hereon,"" he added.

IT stocks slipped ahead of Q1 earnings kickstarting today, while the broader market pared gains to trade flat. At about 10:20 am, the Sensex was down 179.98 points or 0.22 percent at 83,356.10, and the Nifty was down 61.95 points or 0.24 percent at 25,414.15. About 1804 shares advanced, 1329 shares declined, and 150 shares remained unchanged.

He added that any progress in finalising trade agreements over the coming weeks and months should reduce uncertainty, while any flexibility in lowering tariffs should help contain inflation and growth concerns. NSE sectoral indices were largely negative in early trade on Thursday, with the India VIX rising 1.01 percent, indicating a slight uptick in market volatility. Nifty Realty was the top gainer, up 0.86 percent, followed by modest gains in Nifty Metal and Private Bank, which rose 0.20 percent and 0.11 percent, respectively. Nifty Smallcap 100 and Consumer Durables saw marginal gains, while Midcap 100 was flat. On the flip side, Nifty IT and Pharma were the biggest losers, down 0.72 percent and 0.73 percent, respectively. Other indices trading in the red included Auto, Bank, Energy, FMCG, Infrastructure, Media, Oil & Gas, and PSU Bank, all slipping between 0.04 and 0.37 percent.

Morgan Stanley maintained an Overweight rating with a target price of Rs 1,700, while Nuvama raised its target to Rs 2,009 and reiterated a Buy call. Shares of housing finance companies rose by up to 5 percent after Bernstein initiated coverage on four listed firms with a largely positive view on the sector, citing structural growth opportunities and business model resilience. The brokerage has rated HomeFirst Finance, Aptus Value Housing, and Aadhar Housing Finance as ‘Outperform’, while assigning a ‘Market Perform’ rating to Aavas Financiers. TCS shares slipped 1 percent ahead of its Q1 results later today. The IT giant is likely to report a slight improvement in dollar revenue growth for the June quarter on a sequential basis. The country’s largest IT services firm, set to announce its first-quarter results on Thursday evening, is also expected to post a rise in net profit, reversing the decline seen in the previous quarter. As long as the index holds above 25,350, the bullish undertone is expected to strengthen. However, a sustained close above the 25,500 mark will be vital to establish a clear directional bias in the next session. On the downside, the 25,300–25,400 zone has emerged as a critical support area, where the index has repeatedly found buying interest. A decisive close above 25,550 backed by strong buying could reinvigorate bullish momentum and open the door toward the psychological barrier of 26,000. Maruti Suzuki, Jio Financial Services, Eternal, IndusInd Bank, and Tata Steel were the top gainers on the Nifty. Laggards on the index included Bharti Airtel, Cipla, Dr Reddy's, Wipro, and Apollo Hospitals Enterprises.

The brokerage has rated HomeFirst Finance (up 5.4%), Aptus Value Housing (up 2%), and Aadhar Housing Finance (up 1%) as ‘Outperform’, while assigning a ‘Market Perform’ rating to Aavas Financiers (down 1%). Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates For HomeFirst Finance, the target price is set at Rs 1,650 per share, implying an upside potential of 22 percent from the last close on the NSE. The international brokerage highlighted the company’s ability to replicate its operating model across multiple states consistently. Its smaller size allows for faster growth and better productivity metrics, which gives it more flexibility to sustain profitability compared to peers. Aptus Value Housing received a target of Rs 400 per share, implying an upside potential of 17 percent from the last close of Rs 342 on the NSE. Bernstein noted that the company’s higher share of fixed-rate loans and exposure to small business lending positions it well in a falling interest rate environment. Valuations were seen as reasonable. Also read: Groww, Zerodha together lose 11 lakh active investors in the first half of 2025 Aadhar Housing Finance was assigned a target of Rs 550 per share. This implies an upside of 22.5 percent from the last close on the NSE. As the largest and most geographically diversified player among peers, Bernstein expects it to maintain a steady growth trajectory of around 20 percent AUM CAGR. Aavas Financiers, however, was rated ‘Market Perform’ with a target of Rs 2,070 per share. The brokerage forecasts an upside of 5 percent from the last close. Bernstein pointed to weaker yield and profitability metrics, a recent slowdown in growth, and inconsistent outcomes from geographic expansion as reasons for its more cautious stance.

"Sensex, Nifty likely to open flat as investors await Q1 earnings, US trade deal clarity",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sensex-nifty-likely-to-open-flat-as-investors-await-q1-earnings-us-trade-deal-clarity-13256195.html,"Benchmark indices Nifty and Sensex are expected to open largely flat on Thursday as consolidation continues, with investors adopting a wait-and-watch approach ahead of the Q1 earnings season and a potential trade deal between India and the US. At approximately 7:50 a.m., the Gift Nifty was trading at 25,555, up 0.1 percent. In the previous session, the equity benchmark indices closed lower as investors turned cautious ahead of the start of the earnings season and the expected trade deal announcement between India and the United States, with selling pressure seen in IT and oil & gas stocks. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Both Foreign Institutional Investors (FII/FPI) and Domestic Institutional Investors (DII) were net buyers on July 9, with FIIs buying shares worth Rs 77 crore while domestic institutional investors (DII) were net buyers of shares worth Rs 920 crore. Here are the important levels to watch out for in today's session As long as the index holds above 25,350, the bullish undertone is expected to strengthen. However, a sustained close above the 25,500 mark will be vital to establish a clear directional bias in the next session. On the downside, the 25,300–25,400 zone has emerged as a critical support area, where the index has repeatedly found buying interest. A decisive close above 25,550 backed by strong buying could reinvigorate bullish momentum and open the door toward the psychological barrier of 26,000. ""A strong move above Tuesday’s high of 57,303 for the Bank Nifty would validate bullish sentiment and pave the way for further upside traction. Importantly, the index did not witness any major breakdown, underscoring the strength of buyers holding their ground,"" Dhupesh Dhameja of SAMCO Securities said. Onn the downside, the zone between 56,800–57,000 remains a key demand area, where the index has repeatedly bounced and found firm footing, he added. India VIX eased by 2.09 percent, closing at 11.94, remaining well below its psychological threshold of 15. The continued low volatility environment indicates subdued fear in the market, typically favouring a gradual and steady uptrend over sharp directional swings. The Put-Call Ratio (PCR) has slipped sharply to 0.70 from 0.93, signalling increased bearish bias due to heightened call writing.

First Tick: Here are the top global cues for today’s trade,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/first-tick-here-are-the-top-global-cues-for-today-s-trade-132-13248083.html,"Indian benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty are likely to see a positive opening on July 10, tracking cues from GIFT Nifty trading around 25,569 a short while ago this morning. Track the latest updates on GIFT Nifty right here on Moneycontrol. Benchmark indices ended on a negative note after a rangebound session on July 9, with last-hour selling taking Nifty below 25,500 as investors stayed cautious ahead of US President Trump's announcement of trade deals with seven more countries on Wednesday. At close, the Sensex was down 176.43 points or 0.21 percent at 83,536.08, and the Nifty was down 46.40 points or 0.18 percent at 25,476.10. Broader indices outperformed the main indices with BSE midcap index was ended flat, while smallcap index added 0.5 percent. Here is how financial markets across the globe fared overnight: GIFT Nifty (Up) The GIFT Nifty is trading higher at around 25,569, indicating a positive start for the day. Asian Equities (Mixed) Asian shares opened cautiously as investors held back from taking risky bets after President Donald Trump ruled out extending his August deadline. Copper futures fell on Trump’s tariff threat.  US Equities (Gain) Wall Street indexes closed higher on Wednesday, led by the tech-heavy Nasdaq as Nvidia briefly reached a $4 trillion valuation, and Federal Reserve meeting minutes fueled hopes that inflation pressures from President Donald Trump's tariffs would not derail interest rate cuts this year. The minutes for the mid-June meeting showed that most Fed officials said they expect rate cuts will be appropriate later this year, with price shocks from Trump's import taxes expected to be ""temporary or modest."" However, there was little support for a rate cut at the end of July meeting. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 217.54 points, or 0.49%, to 44,458.30, the S&P 500 gained 37.74 points, or 0.61%, to 6,263.26 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 192.87 points, or 0.95%, to 20,611.34.  US Bond Yield (Down) The yields on the 10-year Treasury and 2-year Treasury yields were trading marginally lower at 4.33 percent and 3.84 percent respectively.  Dollar Index (Down) The U.S. dollar slipped further from a two-week high versus major peers on Thursday, as President Donald Trump's latest tariff salvos failed to shake markets, except in Brazil where a threatened 50% levy sent the real sliding as much as 2.8% overnight.  Asian currencies (Gain) Asian currencies were trading mostly higher in the early trade on Thursday with Thai Baht leading the gainers followed by Japanese Yen, Philippines Peso, South Korean Won, Malaysian Ringgit and Singapore Dollar.  Crude (Down) Oil prices dropped on Thursday as the latest tariff announcements by U.S. President Donald Trump were perceived by market participants to threaten global economic growth and demand for the resource.  Gold (Up) Gold held a small gain, as investors weighed President Donald Trump’s latest trade demands along with the outlook for the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate cycle.  Fund Flow Action The Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) bought equities worth Rs 77 crore on July 9, while Domestic institutional investors (DIIs) also bought equities worth Rs 920 crore on the same day.  Hope you're all set for today's trade. We wish you a profitable day ahead.

SEBI proposes to opening up activities for credit rating agencies,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sebi-proposes-to-opening-up-activities-for-credit-rating-agencies-13251964.html,"After proposing to open up business activities for mutual funds, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has now suggested easing restrictions on credit rating agencies (CRAs). The market regulator has proposed that rating agencies be allowed to undertake activities not regulated by SEBI, subject to certain conditions. For instance, they may be permitted to rate financial instruments that fall under the purview of other financial sector regulators, provided they comply with the regulatory framework specified by the regulator concerned. This includes aspects such as policy, eligibility criteria, risk management, investor grievance mechanisms, dispute resolution, inspection, enforcement and claims. The conditions outlined in SEBI’s proposal include that rating agencies can undertake only fee-based and non-fund-based rating activities. Activities not regulated by SEBI must be carried out strictly at arm’s length through one or more separate business units (SBUs) of the rating agency. These SBUs must be segregated by a Chinese Wall and ring-fenced from SEBI-regulated activities. Rating agencies must transfer all non-SEBI-regulated activities to a separate unit within six months of the date of SEBI’s notification. Separate records must be maintained for the non-SEBI-regulated activities within the SBU. Staff involved in these activities must be distinct from those engaged in SEBI-regulated functions. According to SEBI’s proposal, the information technology infrastructure may be shared between SEBI-regulated and non-SEBI-regulated activities, provided proper procedures approved by the rating agency’s board are followed. Additionally, the minimum net worth of the rating agency must be ring-fenced to prevent any impact arising from non-SEBI-regulated activities. Rating agencies will also be required to disclose on their websites the list of activities that are not regulated by SEBI. Before undertaking such activities, upfront disclosures must be made to all stakeholders, including clients, beneficiaries and counterparties. The same disclosure must be included in all engagement letters, contracts, agreements and business communications. A confirmation must also be obtained from stakeholders at the time of engagement, stating that they understand the nature of the activity, the associated risks and the absence of SEBI’s investor protection mechanisms. For existing and ongoing arrangements involving such activities, rating agencies must make the necessary disclosures, obtain the required confirmations or acknowledgements from stakeholders and submit a compliance report to SEBI within six months of the proposal’s notification. Financial sector regulators include the Reserve Bank of India, Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India, Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority, International Financial Services Centres Authority, Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India or any other authority specified by SEBI. SEBI has invited feedback on the consultation paper by July 30."

Outlook for July 10 Aditya Gaggar Director of Progressive Shares A rangebound activity was witnessed for most part of the session, but a sudden fall in the last session dragged the Index lower to close the trade at 25,476.10 with a loss of 46.40 points. FMCG was the top gainer, followed by Auto, whereas Realty and Metal declined by over 1.40% each. A mixed trend was seen among the Broader markets, where Midcaps more or less moved in tandem with Nifty50, while Smallcaps outperformed. Despite the Flag and Pole formation breakout, the Index failed to capitalise on the positive momentum and formed a bearish candle. In terms of levels, 25,580 and 25,430 will continue to act as immediate resistance and support, respectively. Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets traded in a volatile but in a narrow range and ended marginally lower, extending the ongoing consolidation phase. After an initial dip, the Nifty attempted to recover in the first half; however, a sharp decline in select heavyweights during the final hours derailed the recovery and dragged the index lower. Eventually, the Nifty settled at 25,476.10, down by 0.18%. On the sectoral front, the mixed trend persisted—FMCG and auto sectors edged higher, while realty, metal, and IT were among the top losers. The broader market also reflected a mixed performance, with the small-cap index gaining over half a percent, while the mid-cap index ended almost flat. While the tariff-related concerns linger, the focus now shifts to the earnings season, with IT major, TCS, scheduled to announce its results on Thursday, July 10. Additionally, the weekly expiry could add to the choppiness. Amid all this, we maintain our bullish stance and recommend continuing with a “buy on dips” strategy, with a strong emphasis on stock selection. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities Nifty witnessed range-bound movement after a strong upmove, facing stiff resistance around 25,500–25,550. On the hourly chart, the index has slipped below the 50-hour simple moving average, while the RSI has also moved below the 50 mark, indicating weakening momentum. However, it continues to hold above the breakout zone of 25,200–25,250, which may act as immediate support in the short term. As long as this level is sustained, the broader trend remains positive. A sustained move above 25,550 could trigger fresh upside.

Metal index plunges 2%: Viceroy Research's report on Vedanta Resources among key factors behind bearish movement,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/metal-index-plunges-2-viceroy-research-s-report-on-vedanta-resources-among-key-factors-behind-bearish-movement-13248630.html,"Metal stocks sharply plunged in the second half of July 9, pushing the Nifty Metal index down nearly 2 percent to emerge as the top sectoral loser on the market today. While the index was hovering in the red since morning, the selling pressure intensified after short seller Viceroy Research issued a report on its parent firm Vedanta Resources (VRL), claiming that the Anil Agarwal-led conglomerate ""resembles a Ponzi scheme"". Viceroy Research shorts Vedanta Resources debt, calls it a 'parasite' The US-headquartered short seller took a short position of VRL’s debt, calling it a ""parasite holding company with no significant operations of its own, propped up entirely by cash extracted from its dying host, Vedanta Limited"".Vedanta – Limited Resources Viceroy is short of Vedanta Resources (PropCo), the heavily indebted parent & majority owner of Vedanta Limited (NSE : VEDL). The group structure is financially unsustainable, operationally compromised, & resembles a Ponzi scheme. $VEDL 1/ pic.twitter.com/U15v9tlnPm — Viceroy (@viceroyresearch) July 9, 2025 Anil Agarwal-owned mining conglomerate is systematically draining Vedanta to service its own debt, Viceroy further said. ""VRL's actions to meet its short-term obligations directly impair its creditors’ long-term ability to recover their principal, a situation that resembles a Ponzi scheme where Vedanta stakeholders, which include VRL creditors, are the ""suckers',"" it added. Vedanta shares crashed over 8 percent after the report was published. The stock has now made some recovery, trading over 3 percent lower at Rs 440 apiece. Further, the American short seller said that Hindustan Zinc's resources are being ""looted"" through related-party deals with promoter-family owned companies and unjustifiable brand fees. ""Vedanta's crown jewel may be its biggest liability,"" it said while speaking about Hindustan Zinc. The shares of the company are currently down nearly 3 percent to trade at Rs 424 apiece. A perusal of HZL’s brand fee arrangement (2% of revenues) shows that brand fees are often paid in advance on revenue “estimates”, which appear to be consistently over-estimated. This acts as a interest-free line of credit for tens of millions of dollars. $VEDL 15/ pic.twitter.com/IU8ETl0jR8 — Viceroy (@viceroyresearch) July 9, 2025  Trump threatens 50% tariff on US imports Hindustan Copper, which is part of the group, also witnessed significant selling pressure. The shares of the company dropped over 3 percent. This was further buoyed following US President Trump's threat to impose a 50 percent tariff on imported copper soon, leading to a surge in US prices of the metal by more than 12 percent. Hindalco Industries shares were meanwhile down nearly 2 percent to trade at Rs 674 apiece. ""I believe the tariff on copper, we're going to make 50%,"" the US President told reporters at a White House cabinet meeting. Following this, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in an interview with CNBC that the copper tariffs will likely be put in place by the end of July or August 1. Steel, aluminium not to be part of India-US mini trade deal, says reports Steel and aluminium stocks meanwhile plummeted amid reports stating that the two metals won’t be part of the mini trade deal which will likely be announced by US and India soon. Without any exemptions, the steel and aluminium companies will face a 50 percent tariff on exports to America. Tata Steel shares plunged over 2 percent to trade at Rs 158 apiece, while those of Steel Authority of India (SAIL) and National Aluminium Company (NALCO) dropped over 1.5 percent each. NMDC, JSW Steel and Adani Enterprises shares were trading in the red with marginal losses."
