"Gold, silver ETFs rise up to 30% from Thursday's lows as record precious metal rally extends: Should you buy here?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/gold-silver-etfs-rise-30-from-thursday-s-lows-as-record-precious-metal-rally-extends-should-investors-buy-here-13787569.html,"Gold and silver exchange traded funds (ETFs) rebounded sharply on January 23, recovering strong losses which were recorded earlier yesterday. Experts have commented on whether the rally in the precious metals will continue, and what lies ahead. Notably, today’s sharp recovery in ETFs come as precious metals soared to fresh all-time highs. The ETFs however are still away from their 52-week highs, which they had hit a day before yesterday before taking a breather from the rally. Tata Silver ETF, which had crashed up to 24 percent yesterday, hitting a low of Rs 25.56 apiece. The ETF rebounded sharply today, rising more than 17 percent to hit the day’s high at Rs 33 apiece. This marks a 29 percent jump from the low hit by the ETF earlier yesterday. Groww Gold ETF is currently the top gainer among all the gold ETFs. The ETFs jumped 7 percent to trade at Rs 155.97 apiece today. The sharp surge in gold and silver ETFs is a clear reflection of how aggressively investors are repositioning toward safe-haven assets amid heightened global uncertainty, said Justin Khoo, Senior Market Analyst - APAC, VT Market. Should you buy ETFs now? Speaking about yesterday's crash, Prasenjit Paul, Equity Research Analyst at Paul Asset & Fund Manager at 129 Wealth Fund said that what unsettles investors on days like yesterday is not the fall in gold or silver, but the illusion of stability that ETFs create. “Precious metals are volatile assets, ETFs make them feel tradable like stocks, encouraging investors to react to daily price moves. The real risk is owning them without clarity on allocation or purpose or without a proper entry-exit plan,” he explained. Precious metals experienced sharp volatility in late December 2025 and early January 2026. Despite price swings, the fundamentals of precious metals are compelling, driven by near-record industrial demand from solar panels, electric vehicles and AI infrastructure, said Tanvi Kanchan, Associate Director at Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers. “Given the current geopolitical landscape—from ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine to U.S.-China tensions and uncertainty around trade policies under the new Trump administration—precious metals maintain their relevance as portfolio hedges. However, after such explosive gains in 2025, timing a single-entry point is treacherous,” the analyst said. According to Kanchan, investors should consider spreading purchases over the coming weeks or months, instead of deploying capital all at once. For conservative investors, allocating 5-10% of portfolios to precious metals ETFs through systematic purchases reduces timing risk while maintaining exposure to an asset class that benefits from geopolitical instability and monetary policy uncertainty, she said. While the momentum remains intact, such elevated levels also increase the risk of short-term volatility and profit-taking, cautioned Khoo. The analyst added that ETF demand still suggests investor conviction in precious metals as a strategic hedge remains robust. Gold or silver? Motilal Oswal believes the gold looks more favourable now, after silver's massive rally. ""Silver has delivered sharp outperformance in a short span, and with the gold–silver ratio now near lower levels, the near-term risk-reward is turning more favourable for gold. While we remain positive on both metals and silver continues to have long-term upside backed by industrial demand and tight physical market conditions, the recent rally has also increased near-term volatility,"" said Navneet Damani, Head of Research Commodities and Manav Modi, Commodities Analyst, Motilal Oswal Financial Services. The analyst said that in this phase, a higher allocation to gold can help manage fluctuations while staying invested in precious metals. Follow all LIVE updates from the stock markets here."
"Gold, silver ETFs rebound up to 17% a day after crash as precious metals hit new highs: What lies ahead?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/gold-silver-etfs-rebound-up-to-10-a-day-after-crash-as-precious-metals-hit-new-highs-what-lies-ahead-13787468.html,"Gold and silver exchange traded funds (ETFs) rebounded sharply on January 23, rising as much as 17 percent as the precious metals regained ground after some correction. This comes a day after the ETFs crashed significantly following a record rally, as tariff concerns eased. While the ETFs are still away from their recent highs, the precious metals surged to fresh lifetime highs. Precious metals hit fresh all-time highs: Gold futures with February expiry on MCX hit fresh all time high of Rs 1,59,226 per 10 grams. The contracts with April and June expiries also hit lifetime highs at Rs 1,68,000 per 10 grams and Rs 1,73,676 per 10 grams, respectively. Silver futures with March expiry jumped to a fresh all time high of Rs 3,39,927 per kilogram. The contracts with May and July expiries were also at all-time high levels. This comes after the contracts fell around 4 percent yesterday. COMEX silver contract neared $100 per ounce and the gold contract neared $5,000 per ounce, as geopolitical tensions lingered even as US President Donald Trump walked back on his threats of imposing tariffs on European Union nations in his push to acquire Greenland. The commodity prices also rose as the US dollar remained weak. The dollar remained down on Friday, to record its worst week so far in a year, after falling the most in a month in the US trading session. A weaker dollar makes dollar-denominated commodities such as gold cheaper for those holding other currencies, aiding demand. The safe-haven demand for both precious metals continued to rise amid uncertainty around the Greenland issue despite Trump's statements about working towards a future deal. Details of the ""framework"" of the deal have been hazy, and European officials on Thursday appeared to be willing to talk about it only in vague terms, Dow Jones reported. European Union leaders met for a summit late on Thursday after Trump stepped back from his threat to impose new tariffs over Greenland, Blomberg reported. While Trump's step back has removed the immediate threat to European economic and geopolitical sovereignty, leaders are beginning to sift through the longer-term implications, the report said. During the summit, European leaders said they wanted an EU-US trade deal to be back on track after the European Parliament suspended its ratification in protest over Trump's threats. However, Trump's threats shook Europe's confidence in its partner, Reuters reported, quoting EU officials and leaders as saying. ""Transatlantic relations have definitely taken a big blow over the last ‌week,"" the report quoted the bloc's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas as saying. While saying ‌they want to work on strengthening transatlantic cooperation, the EU leaders warned that they were ready to act if Trump was to threaten them again, the report said. Gold ETFs: Groww Gold ETF, Invesco India Gold ETF, Motilal Oswal Gold ETF and Axis Gold ETF climbed around 4 percent each, while 360 ONE Gold ETF, Bandhan Gold ETF, Tata Gold ETF, Angel One Gold ETF, Zerodha Gold ETF, Quantum Gold ETF, ICICI Prudential Gold ETF, Edelweiss Gold ETF and Union Gold ETF meanwhile gained more than 3 percent each. LIC Mutual Fund Gold ETF, Nippon Gold ETF, Nippon India ETF Gold Bees, HDFC Gold ETF and others meanwhile gained around 3 percent each. Silver ETFs: 360 ONE Silver ETF was the top gainer, jumping more than 10 percent, while Tata Silver ETF, which had crashed up to 24 percent yesterday, jumped 9 percent today. Mirae Asset Silver ETF, Axis Silver ETF, Edelweiss Silver ETF, Aditya Birla Sun Life Silver ETF, DSP Silver ETF, ICICI Prudential Silver ETF and others gained around 9 percent each. Nippon India Silver ETF, HDFC Silver ETF, Zerodha Silver ETF and others gained more than 8 percent each. What lies ahead? Despite price swings, the fundamentals of the precious metals are compelling, driven by near-record industrial demand from solar panels, electric vehicles and AI infrastructure, said Tanvi Kanchan, Associate Director, Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers. ""Rather than deploying capital all at once, investors should consider spreading purchases over the coming weeks or months. This approach captures the dip while protecting against further corrections that could see silver test,"" the analyst said. ""For conservative investors, allocating 5-10% of portfolios to precious metals ETFs through systematic purchases reduces timing risk while maintaining exposure to an asset class that benefits from geopolitical instability and monetary policy uncertainty. The structural deficits and industrial demand provide a floor, but expect continued volatility as the market digests 2025's historic run,"" she added. The sharp surge in gold and silver ETFs is a clear reflection of how aggressively investors are repositioning toward safe-haven assets amid heightened global uncertainty, said Justin Khoo, Senior Market Analyst - APAC, VT Market. ""Gold prices trading near $4,950–$4,970 per ounce on COMEX, while silver rallies close to $99 per ounce, have pushed both metals firmly into record territory. This strength is being reinforced by a softer US dollar, persistent geopolitical tensions, and growing concerns around currency stability, all of which are driving strong ETF inflows as investors prefer liquid, regulated exposure. The move is equally striking, with gold prices approaching ₹1.6 lakh per 10 grams and silver nearing ₹3.5 lakh per kg, underscoring the global nature of the rally,"" the analyst said. While the momentum remains intact, such elevated levels also increase the risk of short-term volatility and profit-taking, Khoo said, adding that ETF demand still suggests investor conviction in precious metals as a strategic hedge remains robust.

"As mid & smallcaps kick off 2026 on a rough note, is this the time to spot multi-bagger jewels?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/as-mid-smallcaps-kick-off-2026-on-a-rough-note-is-this-the-time-to-spot-multi-bagger-jewels-13787413.html,"Mid and smallcap stocks have begun 2026 on shaky ground. While the midcap index is down around 4 percent so far this year, the real damage lies beneath the surface. On a median basis, small and mid-cap stocks are down over 25 percent, with several quality names correcting more than 50 percent from their peaks. Market breadth remains weak, reflecting fragile sentiment and the strain on investor portfolios. Importantly, this correction is not new. The selloff has been playing out since September 2024, allowing for both price and time correction, a phase many believe has helped flush out excess froth after years of sharp outperformance. Opportunity or a waiting game? This sets up a familiar investor dilemma. Is it time to cut losses or does this phase provide an opportunity to start spotting potential multi-baggers? Market expert Anshul Saigal believes opportunities are starting to emerge, particularly as earnings momentum shows early signs of improvement. After four consecutive quarters of downgrades, Nifty earnings saw a roughly 2 percent upgrade in the last quarter. Meanwhile, the Nifty Smallcap index is expected to deliver over 30 percent earnings growth, helped by a low base in the coming quarters. But not everyone is convinced that this is the time to aggressively hunt for multi-baggers. Vinit Sambre of DSP Mutual Fund points out that midcaps have gone through one of their strongest re-rating cycles over the past five years, leaving valuations still elevated in parts of the market. “Corrections after long re-rating phases tend to be time-consuming and uneven,” Sambre says, adding that this is a phase to be selective and patient rather than chase headline multi-bagger narratives. What to look for in potential multi-baggers? Both experts stress that stock selection, not timing, is key. Anshul Saigal advises focusing on companies with strong earnings growth, sound governance, robust cash flows, large market opportunities, improving returns on capital and reasonable valuations. Vinit Sambre adds that investors should prioritise business and management quality, balance-sheet strength, sustainable ROCE (return on capital employed) and valuation discipline, along with the patience to hold through volatile phases. Where selective opportunities may lie? Saigal sees value emerging across capital goods, industrials, energy, banking and finance, autos, consumer durables and metals, with even newer themes like defence, renewable energy and hi-tech manufacturing seeing meaningful valuation resets. Sambre, however, urges investors to look beyond past winners. He prefers durable compounders over flashy stories, highlighting areas such as hospitals within healthcare, select NBFCs emerging from asset-quality cycles, power ancillaries linked to long-term capex, and IT services where valuations have reset after prolonged underperformance. On defence and railways, two sectors that delivered exceptional multi-bagger returns in recent years, Sambre notes that gains were driven by strong order inflows, localisation themes and government-led capex. However, after such sharp outperformance, valuations ran ahead of fundamentals, leading to the current correction. Over a 10-year horizon, he believes both sectors continue to offer structural growth opportunities, but future returns will depend far more on earnings delivery and capital efficiency rather than further valuation re-rating. As Saigal puts it, quoting legendary investor Warren Buffett, ""You pay a very high price for a cheery consensus.” In uncertain markets, he says, opportunity often lies where patience and discipline meet.

"IndiGo share price falls nearly 2% in early trade after Q3 results, even as analysts bullish on stock",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/interglobe-aviation-shares-fall-nearly-2-in-early-trade-after-q3-results-even-as-analysts-bullish-on-stock-13787083.html,"Shares of IndiGo operator InterGlobe Aviation Ltd slipped in early trade on Friday with the stock down 1.96 percent at Rs 4,813, a day after the company reported its Q3 FY26 financial results. The airline’s market capitalisation stood at about Rs 1.86 lakh crore. The decline comes after InterGlobe Aviation disclosed a sharp year-on-year fall in reported net profit for the December quarter, weighed down by sizeable one-time exceptional items linked to the implementation of new labour codes and operational disruption during early December. The company had said these exceptional charges materially impacted headline profitability, even as revenue growth and operational metrics remained steady. However, brokerages largely looked past the headline profit decline, maintaining Buy ratings on the stock and reiterating confidence in IndiGo’s underlying business. UBS said the quarter was a “decent show despite disruptions”, noting that management expects capacity growth of around 10 percent year-on-year in Q4 FY26, led largely by international expansion. UBS also flagged guidance for higher costs in the March quarter but said yields are expected to moderate only gradually from a strong base. Citi said the Q3 financial impact of the FDTL-related disruption was lower than its estimates, with yields coming in better than expected and operational parameters broadly in line. Goldman Sachs said reported profit before tax was above estimates, adding that costs excluding forex, particularly aircraft rentals, were lower than anticipated, while management reiterated guidance of around 10 percent ASK growth in Q4, driven mainly by international operations. InterGlobe Aviation stock had closed at Rs 4,929 on Thursday ahead of the results, having gained over 19 percent in the past one year, outperforming the benchmark Nifty 50.

InterGlobe Aviation reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 549.8 crore for the fiscal third quarter, down 77.5 percent year-on-year, weighed down by exceptional charges linked to the implementation of new labour codes and operational disruption during early December. Excluding exceptional items and forex impact, underlying profitability remained healthy, brokerages said in their post-results assessments. Ahead of the quarterly results, InterGlobe Aviation shares rose 1.47 percent to end at Rs 4,929 on NSE on Thursday.

Citi also retained a ‘Buy’ call with a target of Rs 5,700, stating that the financial impact of the FDTL-related disruption was lower than its estimates and that operational metrics were broadly in line. Citi highlighted better-than-expected yields and said IndiGo’s operations are normalising, with market share remaining strong and international route expansion continuing. Goldman Sachs maintained its ‘Buy’ rating with a target price of Rs 6,000, noting that reported profit before tax came in above expectations despite exceptional costs. Goldman said costs excluding forex, particularly aircraft rentals, were lower than anticipated, while yields and ticketing RASK were largely in line with estimates. It also pointed to management’s guidance of around 10 percent year-on-year ASK growth in Q4, driven mainly by international operations. Operationally, while brokerages acknowledged the impact of December’s disruptions and the regulatory reset, they underlined IndiGo’s strong balance sheet, scale advantage and execution track record. With cash balances remaining robust and capacity growth set to resume in the fiscal fourth quarter, analysts broadly see the Q3 setback as transitory rather than structural.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Ipca Laboratories, SAIL, Gland Pharma, Indian Bank, Bharat Electronics, and others on January 23?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-ipca-laboratories-sail-gland-pharma-indian-bank-bharat-electronics-and-others-on-january-23-13786869.html,"The benchmark indices rebounded with a half-percent rally on January 22, with market breadth turning positive. About 2,176 shares advanced against 740 declining shares on the NSE. The market is expected to consolidate with range-bound trading as long as it trades below the current week’s high. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Jay Mehta, Technical Research at JM Financial Services Ipca Laboratories | CMP: Rs 1,485.6  Ipca Laboratories broke out from a prolonged triangular consolidation between January 2 and 9 with a 13.6 percent rally, while broader indices corrected around 2.5 percent, highlighting superior relative strength. The breakout was supported by robust volume participation. Currently retesting the breakout zone, the stock formed a strong dragonfly doji, signalling that the throwback is likely complete and upside resumption is imminent. Momentum studies favour a bullish bias. However, the price remains below short-, medium-, and long-term moving averages. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,680, Rs 1,733 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,380 One 97 Communications Paytm | CMP: Rs 1,260.5  Paytm was confined to a long-term bearish wedge consolidation. It broke down from the pattern a few days ago, but follow-through selling was absent, leading to sideways action with lower highs and lower lows. Wednesday delivered a decisive breakdown below the consolidation range on a strong bearish candle backed by heavy volume. Momentum studies show multiple bearish divergences, with indicators failing to make new highs. The price trades below short- and medium-term moving averages, and trend indicators point to a continued negative bias. Initiate shorts at current levels and add shorts on rises up to Rs 1,295. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 1,145, Rs 1,118 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,368 Amber Enterprises India | CMP: Rs 5,732  Amber Enterprises broke down from a rising trendline active since May 2023 on a strong bearish gap-down with heavy volume, indicating a significant supply shift. Since then, it has maintained a downtrend with lower highs and lower lows inside a sloping channel. Wednesday confirmed a breakdown below the channel. The price trades well below medium- and long-term moving averages. On shorter timeframes, it broke down from a bearish flag-and-pole pattern, suggesting potential for accelerated downside momentum. Sell at CMP and add shorts on rises up to Rs 5,950. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 5,250, Rs 5,090 Stop-Loss: Rs 6,326 Om Mehra, Technical Research Analyst at Samco Securities Steel Authority of India | CMP: Rs 151.65  SAIL has resumed its upward trajectory after a brief consolidation and is now holding above the Rs 150 level, which had earlier acted as a minor hurdle. The stock is trading comfortably above its short-term moving averages and is respecting the rising VWAP (volume-weighted average price), which has acted as a reliable support during recent pullbacks. The stock is stabilising above the mid-Bollinger band and is attempting to move back toward the upper range. The daily RSI is placed near 61, indicating sustained strength. The MACD continues to remain in positive territory, although momentum has moderated slightly. Volumes have improved during the recent up move, reflecting renewed participation after the pullback. The near-term outlook remains favourable as long as the stock holds above the Rs 146 support area. A sustained move above the Rs 154 level could open the path for further upside. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 165 Stop-Loss: Rs 144 Jammu and Kashmir Bank | CMP: Rs 107.09  J&K Bank has witnessed a sharp revival after a brief corrective phase and is now trading firmly above the Rs 105–106 zone, which had earlier acted as immediate resistance. The stock has maintained its position above all key moving averages, reflecting a strong rebound. The latest session marked a decisive move higher with an open-low formation, highlighting sustained strength. The daily RSI is placed near 62 and has moved back into the higher zone, indicating improving momentum. The MACD has turned positive, with the histogram expanding on the upside. Volumes have expanded meaningfully during the breakout. The near-term outlook remains positive as long as the stock holds above the Rs 102–103 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 118 Stop-Loss: Rs 101 Gland Pharma | CMP: Rs 1,723.3  Gland Pharma is showing early signs of stabilisation after a prolonged decline and is now forming a base in the Rs 1,650–1,670 zone. The daily chart indicates a double-bottom formation, with the stock gradually moving higher from recent lows. The stock is trading above the 20-day and 50-day SMAs. A positive divergence is visible in the daily RSI, which is placed near the 53 level. The MACD remains below the zero line but is trending upward, indicating that the recovery is still in its early phase. Volumes remain on the lower side but have shown slight improvement over the last few sessions, which is typically seen when a stock begins to build a base. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,850 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,655 Aakash Shah, Research Analyst at Choice Broking Indian Bank | CMP: Rs 896.75  Indian Bank is trading at all-time high levels, highlighting strong bullish dominance and sustained institutional participation. The stock remains in a well-defined uptrend, with price action consistently forming higher highs and higher lows, indicating strength rather than exhaustion. On the daily chart, the all-time-high breakout indicates strong demand, as there is no overhead supply pressure. The breakout is supported by a strong bullish candle, reflecting confident buying interest. From a moving-average perspective, the stock is trading well above the key EMAs, all of which are positively aligned and sloping upward. The 20 EMA continues to act as a reliable dynamic support, with every minor pullback being absorbed quickly, reinforcing the strength of the trend. Structurally, the Rs 855 zone now acts as a strong demand and support area. As long as the price sustains above this region, the bullish structure remains intact. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 950 Stop-Loss: Rs 855 Bharat Electronics | CMP: Rs 417.3  Bharat Electronics is showing signs of a bullish consolidation breakout setup within a broader uptrend. After an extended rally, the stock entered a brief consolidation phase and is now attempting to resume its upward move. On the daily chart, price action reflects a higher-low structure, with the stock holding above its key moving averages. BEL is trading above the key EMAs, while the 200 EMA continues to trend higher, confirming long-term trend strength. The recent breakout from a short-term falling channel suggests a pause in momentum rather than a trend reversal. The 20 and 50 EMAs are acting as immediate support, indicating that dips are being bought into. Volume has picked up modestly on the breakout attempt, while selling pressure during consolidation remained muted—a positive sign of accumulation. Structurally, the Rs 405 zone now acts as a strong support base. Sustained trade above this zone keeps the bullish structure intact and opens the path toward the Rs 440 level in the coming sessions. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 440 Stop-Loss: Rs 405 Godrej Consumer Products | CMP: Rs 1,246  Godrej Consumer Products is displaying a clear trend reversal and breakout structure after a prolonged consolidation and base formation. The stock has transitioned from a sideways-to-bearish phase into a fresh bullish leg. Price action on the daily chart shows a strong breakout from a multi-week base near the Rs 1,100–1,120 zone, followed by a series of higher highs and higher lows. The stock has decisively reclaimed the 20, 50, and 100 EMAs, with short-term averages turning upward, signalling renewed bullish momentum. Acceptance above the 100 EMA further strengthens the reversal thesis. Volume expansion during the breakout move, combined with relatively lighter volume during the prior consolidation, highlights accumulation behaviour rather than distribution. The sharp bullish impulse leg suggests strong institutional participation. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,320 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,200"

Profit booking has occurred from near the highs of 25400 in the mid part, but the market recovered towards the end. A small red candle was formed on the daily chart with upper and lower shadow. Technically, this market action indicates a formation of high wave type candle pattern. The formation of high wave type candles in the last two sessions signals heightened volatility in the market. The crucial 200day EMA support has been regained on Thursday and Nifty closed above it. The overall near-term trend of the market remains weak, but the short-term bounce is unfolding. A sustainable up move above 25500 could confirm near term bottom reversal pattern for the Nifty. On the other side, any weakness from here could drag Nifty down to the recent swing lows of around 24900-25000 levels in the near term. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The index consolidated after a positive start, supported by strong global cues. However, it faced resistance near the 38.20% Fibonacci retracement level, resulting in a decline from the day’s high of 25,435 to 25,168 before closing near the midpoint of the session’s range. Although the index managed to close above the 200DMA for the second consecutive day, the overall sentiment remains weak, as reflected by the elevated India VIX, which stood at 13.35. In the short term, the index is likely to remain volatile on Friday. Resistance is placed in the 25,480–25,500 zone, while support is seen around 25,125.

Nomura on Ashok Leyland: The international brokerage kept a ‘Buy’ call on Ashok Leyland, and raised its target price to Rs 216 per share. This implies an upside potential of more than 19 percent from the stock’s previous closing price of Rs 181.24 apiece. Nomura believes that Ashok Leyland is a pure-play beneficiary of ongoing upcycle in domestic M&HCV industry.

The stock surged after the company posted an 83 percent jump in consolidated net profit to Rs 46.37 crore for the December quarter of FY26, compared with Rs 25.31 crore in the year-ago period, according to a regulatory filing. Bajaj Consumer Care is part of the Bajaj Group.

UBS said the topline miss, in a quarter supported by strong commodity inflation, could lead to near-term pressure on the stock, outweighing the EBITDA beat.

"Zydus launches Opdivo biosimilar in India, will help cut cancer treatment cost",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/zydus-launches-opdivo-biosimilar-in-india-will-help-cut-cancer-treatment-cost-13785452.html,"Zydus Lifesciences has launched the world’s first biosimilar of nivolumab in India, the pharma company said on January 22, a move that will significantly widen access to one of the most important immunotherapies used in cancer treatment. The product, branded Tishtha, is being introduced at nearly a ‑fourth the price of Amercian drug maker Bristol Myers Squibb’s (BMS) original Opdivo. Tishtha will be available in 100 mg (Rs 28,950) and 40 mg (Rs 13,950) strengths. According to the company, this will help reduce treatment burden for patients who require long, multi‑cycle therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors, a category known to be among the costliest in oncology. “With the launch of Tishtha, we are expanding access to Immuno‑Oncology through a patient‑centric therapy,” Zydus Lifesciences managing director Sharvil P Patel. “Every patient deserves timely access to affordable, advanced cancer care… we remain committed to improving patient access to high‑quality biosimilar immunotherapies.” Why Nivolumab biosimilar matters Nivolumab is one of the most widely prescribed PD‑1 immune checkpoint inhibitors, used across cancer types including lung, melanoma, kidney and Hodgkin lymphoma. These drugs activate the immune system to attack tumors, often extending survival in difficult‑to‑treat cancers. High costs have limited access in lower‑income markets. In India, patients often struggle to maintain continuity of treatment, which can run for several months and require strict dosing schedules. Zydus said its biosimilar aims to address challenges of affordability, consistency and long‑term availability, all of which are critical to patient outcomes. Zydus said Tishtha is developed and manufactured in India, ensuring what Zydus says will be supply continuity for patients who often face interruptions when relying on imported immunotherapies. The availability of two vial strengths is intended to help oncologists optimise dosing and reduce wastage — an important cost consideration in immunotherapy regimens. The company expects the therapy could benefit more than five lakh cancer patients, expanding accessibility to treatments typically restricted to higher‑income cohorts. BMS spokesperson told Moneycontrol that Opdivo’s patent in India remains valid until May 2026."

"Eternal shares tumble 9% from day's high with management transition in focus, brokerages' concerns over competition",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/eternal-shares-tumble-9-from-day-s-high-with-management-transition-in-focus-brokerages-concerns-over-competition-13785503.html,"The shares of Eternal erased all morning gains and sharply fell more than 9 percent from its day’s high on January 22. This came as brokerages analysed the Zomato and Blinkit-parent’s Q3 results, and what lies ahead. The shares of the company dropped to Rs 276.05 apiece in the afternoon. Earlier during the day, the stock had jumped around 8 percent to hit an intraday high of Rs 305 apiece. This was the highest level seen by the stock since December 1 last year. Eternal Q3 Results: Food delivery and quick commerce firm Eternal, which owns the Zomato and Blinkit, on January 22 reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 102 crore for the October-December quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026. This marked a 73 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise from Rs 59 crore net profit reported in the same quarter of the previous financial year. The firm's revenue from operations meanwhile jumped 202 percent to Rs 16,315 crore in Q3 FY26, from Rs 5,405 crore in Q3 FY25. Total expenses for the Gurugram-based firm increased 198 percent to Rs 16,493 crore in the quarter ended December. Along with the Q3 results, the company announced that founder and Group CEO Deepinder Goyal has resigned from his role, and Blinkit’s CEO Albinder Dhindsa will take over. Motilal Oswal sees Eternal in a 'Dogfight': Motilal Oswal noted that Eternal's revenue growth beat its estimate. Zomato’s NOV of Rs 9,840 crore and Blinkit’s adjusted EBITDA margin at breakeven was also above its estimates. However, the brokerage said that the EBITDA respite in Blinkit will likely be short-lived as competitive intensity in quick commerce (QC) re-accelerates. “Potential elevated discounting/investments in both QC and the going-out business are anticipated to constrain profitability in the short term,” it said. Contrary to its earlier expectations, Motilal sees the risk of Eternal being drawn into a “dogfight”, with lower minimum order values and higher discounts. As a result, it reduced its adjusted EBITDA assumptions by around 15 percent for FY27/28E, and accordingly lowered its target price for the stock to Rs 360 (from Rs 420 earlier), while maintaining its ‘Buy’ call. The latest target price implies an upside potential of nearly 27 percent from the stock’s previous closing price of Rs 283.50 apiece. Emkay Global sees more competition ahead: Emkay Global said that Eternal’s Q3 FY25 surprised positively on the profitability front. “The management said that it will respond to competition and is willing to sacrifice margins. We believe that during a land-grab phase, companies should prioritize market share over margins to build scale that can be monetized over time. Eternal’s results underscore that QCom can be highly profitable at scale and Blinkit’s execution remains strong. We expect competitive intensity to increase in the QCom business and Eternal to focus more on market share, which will lead to slower margin expansion in FY27 and FY28,” it said. The domestic brokerage cut its target price for the stock to Rs 370 per share, implying an upside potential of more than 30.5 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. The firm has a ‘Buy’ rating on the call. Elara Capital says Deepinder Goyal's move augurs well: Elara Capital said that the firm’s Q3 headline growth was a tad ahead of estimates on better growth in food delivery and quick commerce. “Deepinder Goyal’s move to the role of Vice Chairman augurs well. He retains strategic oversight and execution is uninterrupted,” the domestic brokerage noted. It retained its ‘Buy’ call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 415 apiece, implying an upside potential of more than 46 percent. JM Financial on Eternal: JM Financial said that the management transition from Goyal to Dhindsa is expected to be smooth, as it elevates a leader with a demonstrated history of scaling a business that now represents the cornerstone of Eternal’s future growth. “Eternal’s primary growth engine, Blinkit, achieved a significant financial milestone in 3QFY26 as it turned Adj. EBITDA breakeven - surpassing our expectations by at least two quarters. This achievement coincided with a pivotal top-leadership restructuring, effective 1st Feb’26,” the domestic brokerage said. It maintains its conviction that margin expansion will continue, notwithstanding aggressive store expansion plans and ongoing competitive intensity. “We reiterate Eternal as our preferred pick with an unchanged Dec’26 TP of INR 400,” it added. Axis Securities on Eternal: From a long-term perspective, Zomato has built a resilient business model by securing multiple strategic verticals and delivering broad-based growth, said Axis Securities. It however added that near-term challenges, such as rising competitive intensity and rapid store expansion, are likely to keep profitability under pressure. “Consequently, we recommend BUY and value the stock at Rs 360/share based on an SOTP valuation, implying a 27% return from the CMP,” it said.

GUJGA’s total volume in Q3FY26 was broadly in line with our estimates at 8.4mmscmd (-3.2% QoQ and -11.5% YoY, PLe: 8.5mmscmd), due to lower Morbi volumes. Lower gas costs and other expenses led to EBITDA/scm of Rs5.8/scm (PLe: Rs5.6/scm) vs. Rs5.6/scm in Q2FY26 and Rs4.4/scm in Q3FY25. EBITDA stood at Rs4.5bn, flat QoQ and up 17.6% YoY (PLe: Rs4.4bn; BBGe: Rs4.4bn), while adjusted PAT came in at Rs2.7bn, down 5.5% QoQ but up 19.8% YoY (PLe: Rs2.5bn; BBGe: Rs2.8bn). To counter competition from propane, the management has cut PNG price for Morbi ceramic industry by Rs4.5/scm with effect from 1st Jan’26. Price differential with propane currently stands at Rs2.4/scm. Morbi volumes have improved to 2.1-2.2mmscmd currently and are expected to reach 2.3-2.7mmscmd by the end of Jan’26 and 3.0–3.5mmscmd by Feb-Mar’26.

We build in volume of 9.1/9.6mmscmd in FY27/FY28E, driven by an expected recovery across all segments. The management has raised its FY26 EBITDA/scm guidance range to Rs5.5–6.5 (Rs5.5/scm earlier, including other income). Outlook We factor in EBITDA/scm of Rs5.9/6.0/scm in FY27/28E.

Lenexis will infuse Rs15 bn in preferential shares and warrants taking their stake to 35.1% (pre open offer). The acquisition is priced at 1.1x FY28 EV/Sales and 6.5x FY28 EV/EBITDA (post IND AS, standalone), which we view as reasonable given the company’s strong brand equity, pan-India licensing from RBI, and No.2 position in the Indian Burger segment. The new promoter, Lenexis foodworks, brings operational expertise, which combined with the likely exit from Indonesia should support a PBT turnaround by FY28. While the stock lacks immediate triggers, promoter-led initiatives, cost optimization, and renewed focus on domestic expansion could unlock value over the next 12–18 months. Key monitorable include effective execution of the Indonesia exit, margin improvement, and sustaining growth in a challenging consumer environment.

Dalmia Bharat (DALBHARA) reported lower-than-expected Q3FY26 operating performance, despite strong volume growth, impacted by weak pricing and elevated costs. Volumes grew 9.5% YoY led by improved cement demand. Average NSR declined 4% QoQ due to decline in cement prices in DALBHARA’s key markets of East and South. While freight costs declined on higher direct dispatches and lower lead distance, RM costs increased due to the Tamil Nadu Mineral Bearing Land Act, other costs rose on account of higher shutdown and marketing expenses, and P&F costs were up, resulting in EBITDA/t of Rs774 (PLe: Rs898). Blended fuel costs may rise in the near term due to higher pet coke prices, partly offset by higher domestic coal and RE usage. Outlook We tweak our FY27/28E EBITDA by -2%/+4% to incorporate lower incentives and higher volumes in FY28 and expect 23% EBITDA CAGR over FY25-28E. At CMP, the stock is trading at 11.6x/9.9x EV of FY27/FY28E EBITDA. Downgrade to ‘HOLD’ with revised TP of Rs2,302 (earlier ‘Accumulate’, TP Rs2,273) valuing at same 11x EV of Sep’27E EBITDA.

Here's what experts say",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/gold-silver-etfs-crash-after-record-rally-should-you-buy-the-dip-here-s-what-experts-say-13785382.html,"Gold and silver exchange traded funds (ETFs) crashed on January 22 amid easing tariff concerns. Analysts have advised what investors should do – buy the dip or wait for more consolidation in the precious metals. The ETFs are mirroring the fall in the gold and silver prices which saw a record rally earlier. Tata Silver ETF dropped as much as 21 percent to its day’s low, while Birla Sun Life Gold ETF fell 12 percent before seeing some partial recovery. Why are ETFs falling today? Trump said that he had reached the outlines of a deal with NATO on the island's future. ""Based upon this understanding, I will not be imposing the tariffs that were scheduled to go into effect on February 1st,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social after a meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte in Davos. He did not give details of the deal. Additionally, he also said that US will not use military force to seize Greenland. ""I won't do that,"" Trump said. ""Okay? Now everyone's saying 'oh, good' that's probably the biggest statement I made because people thought I would use force. I don't have to use force, I don't want to use force, I won't use force,” he added. ""Today’s sharp slump in silver and gold ETFs, with some dropping as much as ~21%, reflects an abrupt shift in macro sentiment rather than a fundamental breakdown in precious metals,"" said Justin Khoo, Senior Market Analyst - APAC, VT Market. Earlier, gold and silver prices had sharply shot up after Trump threatened to use military force to acquire Greenland, triggering tensions between US and EU nations. The tariff threats further fuelled the geopolitical tensions and subsequently safe-haven assets like gold and silver due to a rise in risk-off sentiment. Khoo added that while spot gold and silver still reflect historically elevated levels, the ETF correction looks like profit-taking and risk-rebalancing as equity markets rally. What should you do now? The market is divided between those viewing corrections as buying opportunities and those warning of overheated conditions, said Tanvi Kanchan, Associate Director at Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers. She however added that despite price swings, fundamentals are compelling, driven by near-record industrial demand from solar panels, electric vehicles, and AI infrastructure. “Given the current geopolitical landscape—from ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine to U.S.-China tensions and uncertainty around trade policies under the new Trump administration—precious metals maintain their relevance as portfolio hedges,” the analyst said. Kanchan however cautioned that after such explosive gains in 2025, timing a single entry point is “treacherous”. “Rather than deploying capital all at once, investors should consider spreading purchases over the coming weeks or months. This approach captures the dip while protecting against further corrections that could see silver test,” she said. For conservative investors, allocating 5-10 percent of portfolios to precious metals ETFs through systematic purchases reduces timing risk while maintaining exposure to an asset class that benefits from geopolitical instability and monetary policy uncertainty, according to the expert. With structural drivers such as central-bank accumulation, long-term demand and inflation hedging undiminished, disciplined investors may see this correction as a strategic accumulation zone, but should avoid aggressive short-term speculation given ongoing volatility, Khoo from VT Market said. Is there more volatility ahead? Siddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director at Vibhavangal Anukulakara, said that the drastic correction in gold & silver ETFs is a result of profit-booking as well as unwinding of initial risk-off strategies when metal prices reached record highs. “Although precious metals are supported by demand trends as well as supply gaps in the global market, the current scenario of correction in metal prices indicates volatility in the short term,” he added. Nirpendra Yadav, Senior Commodity Research Analyst at Bonanza, said that with global uncertainties, central bank gold accumulation, and expectations of softer real interest rates over the medium term, gold continues to play an important portfolio-hedging and diversification role. Harshal Dasani, Business Head at INVasset PMS, highlighted the sharper fall in silver ETFs compared to MCX silver, and attributed it to how Indian silver had moved into a speculative premium ahead of the Budget, rather than a sudden collapse in underlying global fundamentals. “Over the last two sessions, silver on MCX had significantly outperformed COMEX because of expectations around an import duty tweak or a policy signal in the Budget,” he said. “That premium was not driven by physical tightness alone; it was largely sentiment-led and expectation-driven. Once it became clear that no immediate duty relief was forthcoming, that excess premium started unwinding. Silver ETFs, which are priced off domestic spot benchmarks but also reflect investor flows and arbitrage pressures, tend to react faster in such “premium collapse” phases. When retail investors rush to book profits, ETF units face additional selling pressure even if MCX futures are still stabilizing,” he added. Follow all LIVE updates from the stock markets here."

Tata Communications shares also dropped, while Bank of India shares hit a multi-year high. The companies had released their results earlier yesterday. PNB Housing Finance Q3 Results: PNB Housing Finance shares declined around 8 percent to trade at Rs 860 apiece. PNB Housing Finance reported a standalone net profit of Rs 520.96 crore for the October-December quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026. This marks a 10.5 percent year-on-year (YoY) jump from the Rs 471.43 crore net profit reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year. However, the net profit fell around 17 percent sequentially from the Rs 626.49 crore reported in Q2 FY26. The firm’s revenue from operations meanwhile gained around 10 percent YoY to Rs 2,109.57 crore in Q3 FY26, from Rs 1,922.76 crore in Q3 FY25. Revenue too however declined around 3 percent sequentially from Rs 2,167.91 crore in Q2 FY26. JM Financial said that PNB Housing Finance reported an overall mixed quarter with PAT missing its estimate. This was primarily driven by weak disbursment/AUM growth and elevated opex levels, the domestic brokerage said. “On an overall level however asset quality trends were positive, with stable GS3/NS3 at 1.04%/0.68% respectively. Credit costs continued to be negative and stood at -0.19% (vs. -0.55% in 2Q), in-line with management guidance,” JM Financial added, while holding its ‘Buy’ call on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,180 apiece, implying an upside potential of nearly 27 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. Motilal Oswal meanwhile said that PNB Housing Finance’s earnings miss estimates due to high open, with net interest margin declining by approximately 4 basis points sequentially. “The company reported a mixed operating performance in 3QFY26, with earnings supported by higher provision write-backs, partly offset by elevated operating expenses and weaker noninterest income,” it said. Bank of India Q3 Results: Bank of India shares gained nearly 7 percent to trade at Rs 168.4 apiece, the highest level seen by the stock since January 2018. Bank of India (BOI) reported a standalone net profit of Rs 2,704.67 crore for Q3 FY26, marking a 7 percent YoY rise from Rs 2,516.69 crore in Q3 FY25. The lender’s net interest income meanwhile grew more than 6 percent YoY to Rs 6,460.69 crore during the quarter under review. Asset quality improved, with gross NPA ratio and net NPA ratio reducing to 2.26 percent and 0.60 percent respectively. Return on Assets (RoA) remained flat on an YoY basis at 0.96 percent. Net profit margin improved to 12.75 percent in Q3 FY26, from 12.61 percent in Q3 FY25. Tata Communications Q3 Results: Tata Communications shares fell nearly 3 percent to trade at Rs 1,570 apiece. Tata Communications reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 365.28 crore for Q3 FY26, marking a 55 percent YoY increase from Rs 235.96 crore net profit reported in Q3 FY25. The firm’s revenue from operations meanwhile rose around 7 percent YoY to Rs 6,188.97 crore. Motilal Oswal said that the firm reported a steady Q3, albeit slightly weaker that its expectations. The domestic brokerage said that the firm’s 9 percent YoY data revenue growth was driven by a recovery in core connectivity and sustained growth in the digital portfolio. The order book remains strong with healthy double-digit growth YoY (and QoQ), driven by large deal wins in core connectivity. The funnel remains robust with digital portfolio contribution at approximately 70 percent, it added. Motilal reiterated its ‘Neutral’ rating on the stock, with a target price of Rs 1,790 apiece, which implies an upside potential of nearly 11 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. JM Financial meanwhile said that the company’s consolidated revenue was largely in-line with its estimate. The domestic brokerage maintained its ‘Buy’ rating on the stock, with a target price of Rs 2,250 apiece, implying an upside potential of more than 39 percent from the stock’s previous closing price.

"Dr Reddy’s counts on biosimilars, weight-loss drug rollout as Revlimid US edge fades",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/dr-reddy-s-counts-on-biosimilars-weight-loss-drug-rollout-as-revlimid-us-edge-fades-13785174.html,"Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd is entering a transitional phase as its once-lucrative generic Revlimid revenue stream dries up, leaving the Indian pharmaceutical player to lean on a pipeline of complex generics and biosimilars to fill the void. The Revlimid cliff The company’s US sales are facing a significant reset. In an interview to Moneycontrol,  chief financial officer MV Narasimham, characterised the upcoming period as a temporary disruption. “This anomaly is going to be within the next four quarters... till December 2026,” Narasimham said in a post-earnings interview on January 21. From January 1, investors should expect negligible sales from Lenalidomide (generic cancer drug Revlimid), he added. The impact is already visible. In the December quarter, US revenues slipped by $35 million sequentially to $338 million, primarily due to lower Revlimid contributions and price erosion. Analysts at Equirus Securities remain cautious, noting that while Q3 Revlimid revenues of over $80 million exceeded expectations, the company’s dependence on the product remains a point of concern. ""DRRD's earnings dependence on Revlimid remains high, but its ability to offset the decline through cost controls and scale-up of semaglutide is debatable,"" the Equirus report said. All depends on execution of semaglutide and biosimilar launches Dr Reddy's is pinning hopes on high-value launches, most notably the GLP-1 drug semaglutide. Narasimham confirmed that the company is ""gearing up for the launch"" in Canada, which is managed as part of its US generics business. The Canada launch is anticipated between late February and May. There is no plant inspection required, and the product is expected to be substitutable, the management said during the earnings call. Beyond weight-loss drugs, the company is advancing a robust biosimilar portfolio. The company has filed a Biologics License Application (BLA) for the intravenous formulation with US approval expected by late calendar 2026. Denosumab, another biosimilar, was launched in the EU, with a US launch likely in the second quarter of FY27 or later due to a CRL, while Rituximab US approval is delayed due to inspection needs, the product has already been launched in the EU. Dr Reddy's is getting ready launch Ozempic (semaglutide) generic in India in March. Narasimham said that the company is ""ramping up the teams"" to support these innovations, particularly in the domestic market. Despite the headwinds in the US, the company delivered what Narasimham called a ""resilient"" performance in Q3. Its net sales stood at Rs.8,727 crores ($971 million), a 4.4 percent year-over-year growth. It EBITDA margin at 23.5 percent, but adjusted to 24.8 percent after excluding a one-time labour code provision of Rs120 crore. The management expects underlying EBITDA margin to be around 24.8 percent to 25 percent after adjusting for one-time provisions. As of December 31, 2025, the company had a net cash surplus at Rs. 3,069 crore. While the base business in India and Russia remains strong — growing 19 percent and 50 percent, respectively, — the market's focus remains on how quickly Dr Reddy's can scale its complex pipeline to offset the $250 million quarterly revenue run rate in the post-Revlimid era. At 11.22 am, Dr Reddy’s stock was trading at Rs 1,220.30 on the National Stock Exchange, up 5.25 percent from the previous close."

Dalmia Bharat: Volume outperformance powers Q3 earnings,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/moneycontrol-research/dalmia-bharat-volume-outperformance-powers-q3-earnings-13784983.html,"Highlights India's fourth-largest cement manufacturer, Dalmia Bharat, posted strong Q3 FY26 results, overcoming GST-linked demand disruptions in the previous quarter. Going forward, the management intends to scale the business through capacity additions, geographic diversification, cost optimisation and potential inorganic growth opportunities. Quarterly result highlights Dalmia Bharat outperformed the broader cement market in Q3FY26 with volumes growing 10 percent year on year (YoY) to reach 7.3 million tonnes (MT), comfortably surpassing the industry’s growth rate of 6-7 percent. The Q3 volume figures highlight that Dalmia Bharat has regained the market share it had lost in earlier quarters. The share of sales through trade channels came in at 62 percent (vs 66 percent in Q3 FY25), whereas the premium products mix stood steady around 23 percent.  Blended realisations contracted 4 percent quarter on quarter (QoQ), owing to the decline in cement prices after GST revisions. During the last quarter, the southern market witnessed a steep fall in prices due to labour shortages and a slowdown in construction activity.  Meanwhile, the eastern markets also witnessed weak price trends on account of Bihar elections. Raw material costs grew just 2 percent YoY despite the additional levy of mineral tax in Tamil Nadu (Rs 160 per tonne). Operating margins expanded by 110 basis points to 17.2 percent, primarily driven by the reduction in freight expenses (down 6 percent YoY), while power and fuel costs were stable YoY. As a result, EBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) per tonne came in at Rs 824, up 8 percent YoY.  Diversifying manufacturing footprint Dalmia Bharat is targeting a pan-India market presence and intends to reach 75 MT capacity by FY28. The key projects include a 3.6 MT clinker and 3 MT grinding unit at the existing Belgaum plant, and a new 3 MT grinding unit in Pune to strengthen its western Maharashtra presence. Dalmia has commenced commercial production from the Umrangso Clinker line (3.6MT) in Jan-26. The management is also evaluating a 6 MT greenfield expansion in Jaisalmer (Rajasthan), for which land acquisition and mining lease formalities have been completed. Environmental clearance is still pending. The management has given a capex guidance of Rs 4,000 crore for FY26. The company added 143 MW of renewable energy (RE) capacity in 9M FY26, taking its total operational RE capacity to 410 MW. The company is targeting 576 MW of RE capacity by mid-2026. Price trend improving Despite regional pricing headwinds throughout the last quarter, 2026 has started on a strong note with prices firming up by 2–3 percent month-on-month in January across all major territories. However, the key challenges for the sector remain elevated competitive intensity and rising fuel costs. Pet coke prices have increased 15-20 percent YoY, which can constrain margins in coming quarters. Outlook and recommendation  The domestic cement sector continues to maintain a positive trajectory, with industry expecting a steady 6-8 percent growth rate due to robust government infrastructure spending, ongoing urban development, and anticipated uptick in private sector demand. Dalmia Bharat’s operational excellence makes it a solid contender in the infrastructure space, though its premium valuation (17.5x FY26 EV/EBITDA) partly reflects the business positives. Therefore, any correction in share price should be viewed as an opportunity to accumulate shares in a healthy company at a reasonable valuation.

Dr Reddy’s stock jumps over 4% today as brokerages turn bullish after Q3 results beat estimates,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/dr-reddy-s-stock-jumps-over-4-today-as-brokerages-turn-bullish-after-q3-results-beat-estimates-13784836.html,"Shares of Dr Reddy’s Laboratories surged over 4 percent in early trade on Thursday after the pharmaceutical company delivered a better-than-expected set of Q3 FY26 results, prompting brokerages to turn more constructive on the stock. The stock outlook turned positive despite a year-on-year decline in profit and continued pressure in the US business. At about 9:20 am, Dr Reddy's shares were trading at Rs 1,208 on NSE, up 4.4 percent from the previous close. Yesterday, ahead of the results, the stock had lost just under 1 percent. Dr Reddy’s reported a 14.4 percent year-on-year fall in consolidated net profit to Rs 1,209.8 crore for the December quarter, smaller than Street expectations of about Rs 1,070 crore. Revenue from operations rose 4.4 percent YoY to Rs 8,726.8 crore, aided by strong growth in India and emerging markets, even as the North America business weighed on overall performance. EBITDA declined 10.8 percent YoY to Rs 2,049.3 crore, while gross margins moderated to 53.6 percent from 58.7 percent a year ago. Dr Reddy's Laboratories stock call: Brokerages upbeat Brokerages said the earnings beat was driven largely by the domestic and emerging markets portfolio, which helped offset weakness in the US. India revenues climbed 19 percent YoY, supported by price increases and the contribution from the Stugeron brand acquired from Johnson & Johnson, while North America revenues declined 12 percent amid a sharp slowdown in Lenalidomide sales. HSBC maintained a buy call on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,435, citing stronger-than-expected sales growth in India and Russia, along with favourable foreign exchange benefits. The brokerage said investor focus now hinges on regulatory approvals for generic semaglutide in Canada and the abatacept biosimilar (IV formulation) in the US, flagging timely approvals as key catalysts for the stock. CLSA upgraded Dr Reddy’s to hold from sell and raised its target price to Rs 1,210, saying the company delivered an earnings beat in Q3. The brokerage highlighted strong growth across India and emerging markets, partly offset by the decline in the US due to lower Revlimid sales. CLSA expects single-digit growth in the US excluding Revlimid and double-digit growth across other geographies, adding that semaglutide has received India approval and is targeted for launch in March, which could support domestic growth momentum. Near-term concerns around Lenalidomide persist, but brokerages broadly believe that sustained growth in India and emerging markets could help stabilise earnings and support the stock over the medium term.

"Eternal shares jump over 6% today, extend gains as brokerages turn bullish after robust Q3 results",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/eternal-shares-jump-over-6-today-extend-gains-as-brokerages-turn-bullish-after-robust-q3-results-13784878.html,"Shares of Eternal Ltd surged more than 6 percent in early trade on Thursday to Rs 301.65, extending the rally triggered by its December-quarter results, as investors reacted positively to improving profitability and a sharp turnaround in quick commerce. The move lifted the company’s market capitalisation to about Rs 2.74 lakh crore. Eternal stock is building on Wednesday’s nearly 5 percent gain, with buying momentum driven by upbeat brokerage commentary following the Q3 FY26 earnings announcement. Why Eternal (Zomato) stock is rising Eternal, which owns Zomato and Blinkit, reported a 73 percent year-on-year rise in consolidated net profit to Rs 102 crore for the December quarter, in line with estimates. Revenue jumped to Rs 16,315 crore, ahead of expectations, led by the quick commerce business. EBITDA rose to Rs 368 crore, with margins expanding to 2.3 percent, while Blinkit and Hyperpure turned adjusted EBITDA-profitable during the quarter. The inflection at Blinkit -- which posted an adjusted EBITDA profit of Rs 4 crore after losses in recent quarters -- has emerged as the key catalyst for the stock. Brokerages upbeat; leadership transition seen as manageable Brokerages struck a largely bullish tone on the results, pointing to Blinkit’s profitability milestone and improving unit economics. CLSA reiterated its 'high-conviction outperform call' with a target price of Rs 503, citing stronger-than-expected contribution per order and a 121 percent year-on-year jump in Blinkit’s net order value. Jefferies and HSBC also maintained buy ratings, highlighting quick commerce EBITDA break-even and food delivery growth acceleration, while Nomura flagged execution consistency as a key monitor despite reiterating a buy call. Alongside the earnings, Eternal announced a leadership transition, with founder Deepinder Goyal stepping down as MD & CEO and Blinkit CEO Albinder Dhindsa set to take over, subject to shareholder approval. Brokerages said the change does not materially alter the near-term investment case, noting that operational control had already been centred around Blinkit under Dhindsa’s leadership. Investors appear to be keenly watching Blinkit’s profitability inflection and steady food delivery growth; along with execution and management transition.

Eternal stock outlook: Brokerages bullish on Zomato after strong Q3 results as Blinkit turns EBITDA-positive,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/eternal-stock-outlook-brokerages-bullish-on-zomato-after-strong-q3-results-as-blinkit-turns-ebitda-positive-13784798.html,"Shares of Eternal Ltd (Zomato) are in focus with the brokerages sharing bullish views on Q3 FY26 results, on the back of a strong quick commerce showing and improving profitability metrics. Ahead of the quarterly results, Eternal stock jumped nearly 5 percent to end at Rs 282.8 on Wednesday. The optimistic brokerage commentary on Eternal's fiscal third quarter results reflects growing confidence in execution, particularly at Blinkit. However, analysts flagged the leadership transition at the top involving founder Deepinder Goyal as a point to monitor. What drove Eternal (Zomato) strong Q3 earnings Eternal, which houses Zomato and Blinkit, reported a 73 percent rise in consolidated net profit to Rs 102 crore for Q3 FY26, in line with estimates, while a tripling in revenue to Rs 16,315 crore. The expansion was led by quick commerce. EBITDA came in at Rs 368 crore, with margins expanding to 2.3 percent. Importantly, Blinkit and Hyperpure turned adjusted EBITDA-profitable during the quarter, marking a key milestone. Zomato stock call: Brokerages see Blinkit inflection as the key trigger CLSA reiterated its 'high-conviction outperform' call on Eternal stock with a target price of Rs 503 per share, implying an upside of nearly 78 percent. CLSA cited Blinkit’s contribution per order beating estimates alongside a 121 percent year-on-year jump in net order value (NOV). The brokerage also highlighted higher-than-expected monthly transacting users, attributing this to consistent pricing and better customer quality; it raised its FY26-28 estimates by 5-15 percent. Jefferies maintained a 'buy' rating with a target of Rs 480, noting that Blinkit delivered positive EBITDA at a time when competitive intensity appears near its peak. On management changes, Jefferies said the transition from founder Deepinder Goyal to Blinkit CEO Albinder Dhindsa as MD & CEO does not alter the near-term outlook, with both leaders continuing their existing responsibilities. HSBC kept its 'buy' call with a target of Rs 350, flagging “multiple positive surprises” in the quarter, including food delivery growth acceleration and quick commerce EBITDA break-even. HSBC also argued that the Q2 slowdown in quick commerce growth was driven by GST changes and seasonality, leaving room for upside to FY27 NOV estimates. Nomura reiterated a 'buy' rating and set a target price of Rs 380. While it said food delivery performance was broadly in line and growth is picking up, Nomura cautioned that quick commerce growth was marginally below expectations despite the surprise break-even, and that the organisational transition warrants close monitoring. It also flagged the risk of prolonged pressure on quick commerce profitability. Management transition in focus Alongside earnings, Eternal announced that founder Deepinder Goyal will step down as MD & CEO and be proposed as Vice Chairman and Director, subject to shareholder approval, with Albinder Dhindsa taking over as MD & CEO. Goyal said he will remain involved at the board level, while day-to-day execution shifts to Dhindsa, who led Blinkit from acquisition to breakeven. Eternal stock performance Eternal shares ended Wednesday nearly 5 percent higher at Rs 282.8, taking the stock’s one-year gains to about 31 percent, well ahead of the benchmark Nifty 50. Even so, the stock remains well below its 52-week high of Rs 368.45. Brokerages believe this gap could narrow if Blinkit sustains profitability and food delivery growth continues to improve.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Tech Mahindra, JK Tyre, Paytm, Hindustan Zinc, Havells India, and others on January 22?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-tech-mahindra-jk-tyre-paytm-hindustan-zinc-havells-india-and-others-on-january-22-13784502.html,"Equity benchmarks closed a volatile session with a one-third percent loss on January 21, with market breadth consistently favouring bears. A total of 2,067 shares saw correction compared to 882 advancing shares on the NSE. A doji-like pattern formation and oversold RSI signal the possibility of a bounce-back, but the sustainability of the same remains key to watch. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Arun Kumar Mantri, Founder of Mantri FinMart Tech Mahindra | CMP: Rs 1,686.7  Tech Mahindra is showing inherent strength, with short-term signs of base formation after a corrective move from recent highs. The stock is trading around its short-term moving averages (20-DMA and 50-DMA), indicating bullish sentiment, while the RSI is hovering near the lower band (around 35–40), suggesting the stock is close to oversold territory and may see a technical pullback. Momentum indicators remain muted, but selling pressure is gradually reducing near support zones, and some upside momentum may resume in the near-term period. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,744 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,652 UltraTech Cement | CMP: Rs 12,231  UltraTech Cement is showing initial signs of short-term base formation, coupled with healthy trading volumes. On technical indicators, the stock is trading around its key moving averages of 20-, 50-, and 200-day, which are providing support and indicating broader bullish sentiment. Further, oscillators such as the RSI are in neutral territory, suggesting neither strong overbought nor oversold conditions, while MACD readings and some short-term averages indicate cautious momentum. Overall, this suggests price consolidation with a bullish bias. If key support levels hold, the price may move towards the Rs 12,500-plus zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 12,594 Stop-Loss: Rs 12,010 TVS Motor Company | CMP: Rs 3,602  TVS Motor is currently hovering around strong support zones of Rs 3,550–3,600 on the daily charts. Technical indicators are showing mixed signals, with short-term base formation coupled with oversold conditions that may attract some counter-trend buying at the current juncture. On the daily chart, key momentum tools like the RSI are deeply oversold, while oscillators such as MACD and Stochastic suggest oversold zones on short-term momentum indicators. On the other hand, any price break below the Rs 3,500 zone, which is a key support, may suggest a continuation of the ongoing correction, while any sustained move above it may resume short covering in the counter. Resistance for the price is around Rs 3,770–3,790 on the short-term timeframe. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,753 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,512 Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical and Derivatives Research at SBI Securities JK Tyre and Industries | CMP: Rs 510.95  JK Tyre has been consolidating in the Rs 525–483 range since December 23, indicating a healthy pause after the prior move. Despite the sideways action, the stock continues to hold above its 20-day EMA, which is acting as a dynamic support. The RSI has reclaimed the 60 level, while the MACD remains above both the signal and zero lines. Holding above the Bollinger Band midline, momentum indicators suggest the stock is well positioned for an upside breakout. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 510–505. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 545 Stop-Loss: Rs 490 One 97 Communications Paytm | CMP: Rs 1,235.9  Paytm had been consolidating in the Rs 1,248–1,357 range since early December, but repeated failures near the Rs 1,355–1,360 resistance zone signalled exhaustion. The stock has now broken below the lower end of this range, closing lower on January 21, confirming a bearish breakdown. Momentum indicators have deteriorated sharply, with the RSI slipping below 40 and DI– crossing above DI+, indicating growing bearish control. The MACD remains below both the signal and zero lines, suggesting further downside risk in the near term. Hence, we recommend selling the stock in the zone of Rs 1,235–1,230 with a stop-loss of Rs 1,265. On the downside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 1,130 in the short term. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 1,130 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,265 Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities Hindustan Zinc | CMP: Rs 697.55  Hindustan Zinc has been on a dream run, with the ascending chart pattern remaining intact across multiple timeframes. Dips are being bought, and rallies remain strong. The RSI has recently re-entered a bullish crossover, and the price continues to trade comfortably above the 20 EMA. In the short term, the trend is likely to remain strong, with the potential to rally towards Rs 730. Support is placed at Rs 685; a break below this level could lead to a decline. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 730 Stop-Loss: Rs 685 Aditya Birla Capital | CMP: Rs 346.25  Aditya Birla Capital has seen increased weakness following a breakdown from recent consolidation. The stock has also fallen below both the 20 EMA and the 50 DMA, strengthening bearish sentiment. The RSI is in a bearish crossover, indicating the possibility of further downside. In the short term, the trend is likely to remain weak, with the potential to fall towards Rs 331, while resistance is placed at Rs 353, above which sentiment may improve. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 331 Stop-Loss: Rs 353 Havells India | CMP: Rs 1,316  Havells India’s chart looks weak, as the stock has declined after breaking down from recent consolidation. In addition, the stock has been sustaining below the 20 EMA for the last two sessions, confirming a bearish trend. The RSI is in a bearish crossover and continues to fall, further strengthening bearish sentiment. In the short term, the trend is likely to remain weak, with the potential to drift towards Rs 1,280. However, after the sharp fall over the last two days, it would be prudent to sell on rallies rather than at current levels. Resistance is placed at Rs 1,365; a move above this level could improve sentiment. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 1,280 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,365"

"Torrent Pharma takes control of JB Pharma, overhauls board & senior leadership",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/torrent-pharma-takes-control-of-jb-pharma-overhauls-board-senior-leadership-13783837.html,"Torrent Pharmaceuticals Ltd., on Wednesday told stock exchanges that it has completed its acquisition of JB Chemicals & Pharmaceuticals Ltd., triggering an overhaul of the company’s board and senior leadership. The transaction, which closed on January 21, 2026, involved Torrent purchasing 7,44,81,519 shares, or 46.39% of JB Pharma’s fully diluted equity, from Tau Investment Holdings Pte. Ltd., an entity of US Private Equity firm KKR, under a share purchase agreement signed on June 29, 2025, and amended on July 3, 2025. With the acquisition now consummated—and an additional 1,317 shares picked up through the open offer—Torrent has formally assumed controlling promoter status at JB Pharma. JB Pharma’s board met the same day to record the change in control, acknowledge Torrent as the incoming promoter, and formally reclassify Tau as a public shareholder under SEBI rules. The transition has prompted significant churn in JB Pharma’s governance structure. Three non‑executive, non‑independent directors—Gaurav Trehan, Akshay Tanna, and Prashant Kumar—resigned from the board, citing the change in control and the need to facilitate reconstitution. Each resignation took effect immediately at the conclusion of the board meeting. The shake‑up extended to senior management: Nikhil Chopra, JB Pharma’s Whole‑time Director and Chief Executive Officer, tendered his resignation. He stepped down as Whole‑time Director effective immediately and will continue as CEO only until March 31, 2026, after which he will exit the company entirely to pursue other professional opportunities. In parallel, the company announced a slate of new board appointments backed by Torrent Pharma’s nominations. Aman Mehta, Managing Director of Torrent Pharma, has been appointed Managing Director of JB Pharma for a three‑year term. Mehta, who has played a key role in Torrent’s acquisitions—including Unichem and Curatio—brings deep operational experience and strategic oversight from his decade‑long tenure within the Torrent Group. Three additional directors were also inducted are Amal Kelshikar, a pharma veteran with 32 years of experience across Abbott, Novartis, AstraZeneca, and Baxter, Hasmukh Patel, Torrent Pharma’s Chief Operating Officer and Sudhir Menon, Executive Director (Finance) & CFO of Torrent Pharma. With Torrent now in operational control, JB Pharma's board committees have also been reconstituted effective January 21, 2026, and the company will seek shareholder approval for the new appointments through a postal ballot. Torrent Pharmaceuticals agreed to acquire JB Chemicals & Pharmaceuticals in a landmark transaction valuing JB Pharma at Rs 25,689 crore on a fully diluted basis. As part of this, Torrent purchased the 46.39 percent stake from Tau Investment Holdings (a KKR entity) for Rs 11,917 crore, paying Rs 1,600 per share. Additional components of the transaction include open offer for 26 percent of public shareholding at Rs 1,639.18 per share, totaling Rs 6,842.8 crore, and also acquisition of up to 2.8 percent from employees at the same Rs.1,600 price, costing Rs 719 crore. The transaction strengthens Torrent’s footprint in branded generics and chronic therapies—segments where JB Pharma has long maintained strong franchises in gastrointestinal, hypertension, and pediatric categories. With control secured and management realigned, the acquisition positions Torrent to accelerate portfolio expansion, supply‑chain integration, and margin improvements within its India‑focused growth strategy."
Dr. Reddy’s set for March launch of affordable Ozempic generic in India; ramps up market‑priming efforts,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/dr-reddy-s-set-for-march-launch-of-affordable-ozempic-generic-in-india-ramps-up-market-priming-efforts-13784215.html,"Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories is gearing up to launch its generic version of semaglutide in India on March 21, positioning itself for an early mover advantage in one of the country’s largest chronic disease opportunities. The company confirmed that the first wave of approvals covers the injectable formulation of Ozempic, Novo Nordisk’s blockbuster diabetes drug, with oral and weight‑loss versions to follow. The pharmaceutical major said it is preparing for a “competitive” pricing strategy aimed at boosting affordability and expanding access among India’s growing diabetes population. Executives reiterated that affordability remains a core pillar of Dr. Reddy’s India playbook, though they stopped short of disclosing exact price points. Market estimates suggest generic versions of semaglutide  could enter at 50–60% below the innovator. “We would ensure that it is a competitive pricing in the market,” said M.V. Ramana, CEO – India & Emerging Markets, when asked about where Dr. Reddy’s plans to position the drug versus Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic, at company's post earnings media call on Wednesday. “Affordability has been something that is core to Dr. Reddy’s, so that’s the plan as we get ready to launch the product.” Dr. Reddy’s said it is fully equipped to handle demand from day one, drawing on both in‑house facilities and contract manufacturing partners. The company is preparing manufacturing capacity for up to 12 million injectable pens annually through partner channels alone. The drug is fully developed in‑house, including the active pharmaceutical ingredient, and will also be supplied to domestic partners who will market it independently. CEO Erez Israeli added, “we are aiming for about 12 million pens that can come from the partner in one year. And we hope that we can sell all of it or most of it.” Executives confirmed that Dr. Reddy’s has already begun priming the market ahead of the launch. This includes deploying dedicated field forces to promote the drug, running large‑scale medical education programmes with Indian and global specialists, and building a patient‑support ecosystem to help with therapy adherence once treatment begins. The company said its promotional efforts will remain focused strictly on healthcare professionals, distancing itself from cosmetic or off‑label weight‑loss use. Alongside the India rollout, the company is preparing for launches across more than 80 markets over the next 12 months. Canada is among the earliest target countries, with Dr. Reddy’s awaiting a decision on its regulatory submission. Approval could arrive any time between now and mid‑May, allowing the company to launch even before May if regulators clear the product early. Additional priority markets include Turkey, Brazil and several emerging markets where Dr. Reddy’s will sell both directly and through business-to-business partners. The current approval in India covers only the injectable version for diabetes treatment. Market authorization for the oral semaglutide tablet and the Wegovy‑equivalent obesity indication will follow separately once regulatory clearances are obtained. The company said it intends to enter both oral and injectable GLP‑1 formats, reflecting global treatment trends that are expanding rapidly into obesity care. Executives described semaglutide as one of the most significant commercial opportunities for India’s pharmaceutical sector, given rising incidence of diabetes and growing awareness around weight management therapies. The company expects the product to become a meaningful growth driver for its India business beginning FY26. Dr. Reddy’s aims to leverage this launch as part of its broader ambition to climb into the top five pharma companies in the Indian market by the end of the decade—a target driven by a mix of innovative therapies, consumer health growth and strategic inorganic opportunities."

On the lower end, support is placed at 25,125. A decisive fall below 25,125 could trigger further panic in the market. On the higher end, resistance on a closing basis is placed at 25,200. Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities After showing sharp weakness on Tuesday, Nifty shifted into a high volatility with weak bias on Wednesday and closed the day lower by 75 points. Nifty opened on a weak note and continued with negative trend in the early-mid part of the session. Upside recovery has emerged from near 24900 levels in the mid part, but the market was not able to sustain the recovery towards the end and closed lower. A small green candle has been formed on the daily chart with long upper and lower shadow. Technically, this market action indicates a formation of doji type candle pattern (not a classical one), which is reflecting ongoing volatility in the market. Normally a formation of doji after a reasonable decline calls for a reversal post confirmation. The underlying trend of the market continues to be weak. Nifty is finding difficulty in sustaining above the crucial support of 25150 levels (200day EMA). Further weakness below 24900 could possibly drag Nifty down to 24500 in the near term. However, a sustainable upmove above 25200 is likely to open short term bounce back in the market.

RoA jumped to a multi-quarter high of 0.9%. Outlook We roll forward valuations to FY28E and maintain HOLD with a revised TP of INR 24 (vs. INR 22) alongside an unchanged target multiple of ~1.2x.

The firm’s revenue from operations rose 23 percent YoY to Rs 3,778.2 crore during the quarter under review. “We are also applying Agentic AI within our own operations, as a ‘customer zero’ to improve productivity and speed adoption at scale, an approach further validated by our recognition as a Microsoft Frontier Firm. As we move ahead, our priority remains sustaining growth through consistent execution as demand continues to shift toward larger, more complex engagements,” said Persistent’s CEO Sandeep Kalra. Along with the Q3 results, Persistent Systems announced an interim dividend of Rs 22 per share for the financial year 2026. The record date to determine the eligibility of the shareholders set to receive the payment has been set at January 27. JM Financial on Persistent Systems: JM Financial maintained its ‘Buy’ rating on the stock, and increased its target price to Rs 7,600 per share. This implies an upside potential of nearly 20 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. The domestic brokerage said that the firm reported yet another strong quarter in Q3, with revenue meeting elevated expectations. It added that margins beat expectations materially. “PSYS continues to have a competitive edge and is benefitting from AI-led modernization, adoption and data readiness led demand. Its head start with platforms/tools such as SASVA and iAURA, alongside internal AI-led productivity efforts allows it to present a compelling value proposition on cost and speed of delivery to clients, driving deal momentum in our view,” JM Financial said. Choice Institutional Equities on Persistent Systems: Choice Institutional Equities increased its target price for the stock to Rs 7,000 per share, while maintaining its ‘Add’ rating. This implies an upside potential of more than 10 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. “Despite ongoing macro uncertainty, the company has sustained consistent execution, led by its strengthening product engineering capabilities…enhancing its competitive positioning in enterprise AI,” it said. HSBC on Persistent Systems: HSBC held a ‘Hold’ call for the stock with a target price of Rs 6,560 per share, which implies an upside potential of more than 3 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. The international brokerage reported strong growth in Q3 with further improvement in profitability, the firm said. However, it noted that the market expectations seem to be fully priced in the valuation. Nomura on Persistent Systems: Nomura held a ‘Neutral’ call for the stock, with a target price of Rs 6,100 per share. The international brokerage said that the IT company’s growth was in-line with estimates, and margin beat expectations in Q3 FY26. SRF Q3 Results: SRF reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 432.66 crore for Q3 FY26, marking a 60 percent YoY rise from Rs 271.08 crore reported in Q3 FY25. The firm’s revenue from operations meanwhile gained 6 percent YoY to Rs 3,712.53 crore, missing estimates. Brokerage UBS says SRF's medium‑term growth looks constrained due to elevated refrigerant prices, continued Chinese pricing pressure, ongoing weakness in agri‑chem, and management abandoning its 20 percent specialty‑chem growth target.

"Asian shares extend selloff, global bond rout stokes fresh anxiety",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/asian-shares-extend-selloff-global-bond-rout-stokes-fresh-anxiety-13782387.html,"Asian stocks extended their losses for a third session on Wednesday, undone by heightened tensions over U.S. threats to acquire Greenland ahead of President Donald Trump's Davos speech, while a global bond rout appeared to slow for now. Fears of offshore selling of U.S. assets - the so-called ""Sell America"" trade that emerged after last year's ""Liberation Day"" tariff announcements in April - gripped markets as Wall Street tumbled over 2% overnight and the U.S. dollar suffered its biggest fall in over a month. That sent investors fleeing to the safety of gold and silver, which both notched record highs. ""The 'sell America' trade was the driving force behind major market moves overnight, as investors looked to reduce exposure to the U.S., seen by many as an unreliable partner pursuing self-defeating policies,"" said Mantas Vanagas, a senior economist at Westpac. Trump, however, doubled down on his rhetoric over Greenland, saying there was ""no going back"" on his goal to control the island, refusing to rule out taking it by force. His threat of tariffs on Europe has also rekindled fears of a global trade war. The European Union will convene an emergency summit in Brussels on Thursday to discuss the matter, with the long-standing U.S.-EU alliance clearly at risk. All eyes are now on the World Economic Forum in Davos where Trump is due to deliver a speech on Wednesday. In early trade, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.3%. Japan's Nikkei slumped 1.2%, down for the fifth straight day. Nasdaq futures and S&P 500 futures advanced 0.2% after Wall Street suffered the biggest daily drop in three months overnight. The S&P 500 lost 2.06% while the Nasdaq Composite tumbled 2.4%. Both EURO STOXX 50 futures and DAX futures fell 0.4%. JAPAN'S BOND ROUT PAUSES FOR NOW The global bond market was still reeling from a brutal selloff, having been caught up in a perfect storm of worries over exposure to U.S. assets and a surge in Japanese government bond yields. Market worries over increased government spending under Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi sent bond yields there skyrocketing to record highs. Investors were trying to catch their breath in early trading. Providing some relief to frayed debt market nerves, the 40-year Japanese government bond yields retreated 6 basis points on Wednesday to 4.145% after surging 26 bps a day earlier to a record high of 4.215%. Liquidity in other tenors remains thin. U.S. Treasury yields were also steady on Wednesday. The benchmark 10-year yield slipped 1 bp to 4.285%, having jumped 7 bp overnight to a five-month high of 4.313% amid the ""Sell America"" fears. Danish pension fund AkademikerPension said on Tuesday it would sell off its holding of U.S. Treasuries, worth some $100 million, by the end of this month, blaming weak U.S. government finances. In the currency markets, the U.S. dollar held steady at 98.56 against its major peers, having dropped 0.5% overnight - the biggest daily fall since early December. The yen was steady at 158.19 per dollar, but lost out on a number of crosses, with the Swiss franc hitting a record high of 200.19 yen. The Bank of Japan meets on Friday and though no rate hike is expected this time, policymakers could flag a tightening as soon as April. Oil prices fell as pressure from geopolitical tensions and an expected build-up in U.S. crude inventories outweighed a temporary halt in output at two large fields in Kazakhstan. West Texas Intermediate crude oil prices for March fell 1.31% to $59.57 a barrel. [O/R] Gold prices rose 0.8% to $4,806 an ounce, a new record high, while silver climbed 0.4% to $95.01, just short of a record top of $95.87 hit on Tuesday."

Track the latest updates on GIFT Nifty right here on Moneycontrol. Dalal Street witnessed a sharp sell-off on January 20, with benchmark indices plunging more than 1 percent each, dragging the Nifty below the 25,200 mark, intraday, amid concerns over global trade tensions, mixed quarterly earnings, weak global cues, a falling rupee, broad-based selling, and continued FII outflows. At close, the Sensex was down 1065.78 points or 1.28 percent at 82,180.47, and the Nifty was down 353 points or 1.38 percent at 25,232.50. GIFT Nifty (Gains) The GIFT Nifty is trading higher at around 25,294, indicating a flat to positive start for the day. Asian Equities (Slip) Asian stocks retreated on Wednesday, tracking a selloff on Wall Street as the US-Europe trade conflict over Greenland and turmoil in bond markets rattled investors.  US Equities (Down) All ​three major Wall Street indexes ended Tuesday with their biggest one-day drops in three months, in a broad selloff triggered by concerns ‌that fresh tariff threats from President Donald Trump against Europe could signal renewed market volatility. All three U.S. equity benchmarks registered their worst one-day performance since October 10, with both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite  slipping below their 50-day moving averages. The S&P 500 lost 143.15 points, or 2.06%, to ‌end at 6,796.86 points, while the Nasdaq Composite gave up 561.07 points, or 2.39%, to 22,954.32. The Dow Jones Industrial ​Average fell 870.74 points, or 1.76%, to 48,488.59.  US Bond Yield (Up) Treasuries joined a selloff in global bonds on Tuesday as escalating trade tensions, spurred by proposed US tariffs relating to Greenland, undermined demand for American assets. The yield curve bear steepened as cash trading resumed following a US holiday, with 10- and 30-year yields both climbing three basis points in early Asia trading.  Dollar Index (Down) The dollar fell as President Donald Trump continues pushing with his plan on Greenland, sparking risks of a bigger trade rift with Europe.  Asian Currencies (Up) Asian Currencies were trading mostly higher in the early trade on Wednesday, with the Thai Baht leading the gainers, followed by Philippines Peso, the South Korean Won, Japanese Won.  Crude (Slips) West Texas Intermediate crude oil prices fell on Wednesday as pressure from geopolitical tensions and an expected build-up in U.S. crude inventories outweighed a temporary halt in output at two large fields in Kazakhstan.  Gold (Rises) Gold rose to a record high and silver was near an all-time peak as the worsening crisis over Greenland and a meltdown in Japanese government debt supported haven demand.  Fund Flow Action Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) continued their selling on January 20, offloading equities worth around Rs 2,938 crore, while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) bought shares worth approximately Rs 3,665 crore.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade HDFC Life Insurance, Mastek, Dalmia Bharat, JK Cement, Lodha Developers, and others on January 21?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-hdfc-life-insurance-mastek-dalmia-bharat-jk-cement-lodha-developers-and-others-on-january-21-13782320.html,"The benchmark indices were caught in a bear trap, with the Nifty 50 falling 1.38 percent on January 20. Market breadth was heavily dominated by bears, with about 2,552 shares declining against 388 rising shares on the NSE. The market may consolidate with a negative bias after decisively breaking below the previous week’s low. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Amol Athawale, VP Technical Research at Kotak Securities Britannia Industries | CMP: Rs 5,884  After the short-term correction in Britannia from higher levels, the downward momentum has stalled and the stock has entered a consolidation phase over the last few sessions. Moreover, the stock is trading near its important demand zone. The structure suggests a revival of the uptrend from current levels in the near future. For traders, Rs 5,660 would be the key support level to watch. Above this level, the uptrend structure could continue towards Rs 6,300. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 6,300 Stop-Loss: Rs 5,660 Oil and Natural Gas Corporation | CMP: Rs 240.39  After the sharp up move over the last couple of sessions, ONGC witnessed profit booking from higher levels. However, closing near the important retracement zone and the short-term moving average suggests a bullish continuation chart structure. Therefore, the stock is likely to resume its uptrend in the coming sessions. For the next few trading sessions, Rs 232 could be the trend-decider level for the bulls. If the stock sustains above this level, a further uptrend towards Rs 257 can be expected. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 257 Stop-Loss: Rs 232 HDFC Life Insurance Company | CMP: Rs 732.1  On the daily timeframe, HDFC Life has been in a downtrend. Therefore, it is currently in oversold territory and is trading near its demand area. The texture of the chart formation and the RSI indicate that the stock is likely to rebound for a new leg of the up move from its demand zone. For positional traders, Rs 705 would be the decisive level. Trading above this level, the uptrend formation may continue towards Rs 785. However, if the stock closes below Rs 705, traders may prefer to exit long positions. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 785 Stop-Loss: Rs 705 Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors Mastek | CMP: Rs 2,223.8  On the daily chart, Mastek has been trending higher for the past one week and has outperformed broader market indices by consistently closing above the previous day’s high over the last three trading sessions, highlighting underlying strength. The stock has already confirmed a breakout from a triangle pattern on the daily chart, which is a positive technical development. Additionally, the Bollinger Bands have begun to expand, indicating an increase in volatility. For now, a sustained move above Rs 2,245 is required for bullish momentum to continue, which could drive prices towards the prior swing high zone of Rs 2,370–2,400, as long as the Rs 2,150 level remains protected on the downside. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,370, Rs 2,400 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,150 Dalmia Bharat | CMP: Rs 2,191.4  Dalmia Bharat has been forming a Cup and Handle pattern since October 2025. In the previous session, the stock gained over 1.5 percent and managed to close near the neckline around the Rs 2,200 level. A sustainable breakout above this zone could pave the way for a fresh rally. The stock continues to form higher highs and higher lows, indicating positive price action. Additionally, the consistent green histogram following a bullish crossover of the MACD provides double confirmation of the bullish outlook. For now, a decisive move above Rs 2,220 may trigger fresh buying interest, which can push prices towards Rs 2,400, the first target as per the length of the handle. On the downside, the Rs 2,110 level is expected to act as key support. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,400 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,110 JK Cement | CMP: Rs 5,891.5  In the previous session, JK Cement gained 1.84 percent, supported by the highest trading volumes seen since September 19, 2025. The stock has consistently held above the prior day’s low for the last five trading sessions, indicating buying from lower levels. Since November 2025, JK Cement has been trading within a rectangular range of Rs 5,361–6,030, suggesting a phase of accumulation. In the previous session, prices attempted a breakout from this range but failed to close above it. The RSI is currently hovering near 55, indicating the absence of a strong trending move. For now, a decisive breakout above Rs 6,030 could trigger fresh upside momentum towards the Rs 6,450 level, with Rs 5,790 acting as an important support. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 6,450 Stop-Loss: Rs 5,790 Aditya Thukral, Founder & Analyst of AT Research & Risk Managers Delhivery | CMP: Rs 384.85  Delhivery exhibited a box pattern, and a breakdown from this pattern was witnessed on January 12, accompanied by rising volumes. The stock is consistently trading below all its major exponential moving averages, namely the 10-day, 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day EMAs, all of which are sloping downwards. An established downtrend is evident, marked by the formation of lower highs and lower lows. Additionally, the stock has recorded its lowest close since July 3, 2025. A continuation of the downtrend is expected following the breakdown from the box pattern. Any minor bounce towards the previous support level of Rs 391 will act as a selling opportunity, as prior supports have turned into resistances. Sell Delhivery Futures on a rise around Rs 391, with a stop-loss at Rs 398, targeting Rs 377 over the next two weeks. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 377 Stop-Loss: Rs 398 Suzlon Energy | CMP: Rs 46.34  Suzlon entered a correction phase after forming a top around the Rs 86 level on September 12, 2024. The stock is consistently trading below all its major exponential moving averages—10-day, 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day EMAs—and has established a clear downtrend with the formation of lower highs and lower lows. Additionally, the stock has closed at its lowest level since June 6, 2024. With prices now moving towards the targets of a bearish flag pattern on the daily chart, and the breakdown occurring with rising volumes, the pace of the downtrend is accelerating due to falling trendlines. This presents a short-selling opportunity in the futures segment. Any minor bounce towards the previous support level of Rs 47.50 should be used as a selling opportunity, as it has now turned into resistance. Sell Suzlon Futures on a rise around Rs 47.50, with a stop-loss at Rs 48.60, targeting Rs 45.20 and Rs 43.50 over the next two weeks. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 45.20, Rs 43.50 Stop-Loss: Rs 48.60 Lodha Developers | CMP: Rs 979.3  Lodha has confirmed a medium-term downtrend with the break of the swing low of Rs 1,035.15, formed during the previous corrective leg. The stock is witnessing another leg of correction after forming a top near Rs 1,530. It is consistently trading below all its major exponential moving averages—10-day, 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day EMAs—all of which are sloping downward. The short-term downtrend has now extended into a medium-term downtrend, marked by lower highs and lower lows. Additionally, the stock has recorded its lowest close since December 29, 2023. The realty sector has remained under pressure and has been one of the biggest losers during the ongoing correction, underperforming for several months. A continuation of the downtrend is expected in this realty stock, given the established medium-term downtrend. Any minor bounce towards the previous support level of Rs 1,003 should be used as a selling opportunity, as prior supports have turned into resistances. Sell Lodha Futures on a rise around Rs 1,003, with a stop-loss at Rs 1,051, targeting Rs 926 over the next three weeks. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 926 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,051"

"Markets at three-month low: Analysts say Bank Nifty may continue to outperform Nifty, cite multiple tailwinds",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/markets-at-three-month-low-analysts-say-bank-nifty-may-continue-to-outperform-nifty-cite-multiple-tailwinds-13781950.html,"The Nifty Bank index has seen some correction in 2026 so far, declining nearly 2 percent after hitting a lifetime high earlier this month. However, the index is still outperforming the broader Nifty 50 index, which dropped more than 4 percent during the same period. Markets experts have highlighted reasons why the sectoral index remains comparatively resilient amid broader downturn in the stock markets, and what lies ahead. The Nifty Bank index fell 0.81 percent to close at 59,404.20 on January 20, extending decline for the second consecutive session. The index had earlier hit a fresh all-time high of 60,437.35 on January 5, before losing stream. Nifty 50 also had hit its lifetime high of 26,373.20 on January 5, before beginning to decline. The index dropped to a three-month low of 25,171.35, before recovering some losses to close at 25,232.50 on Tuesday. Why Bank Nifty shows resilience amid market downturn? Bank Nifty is exhibiting distinct relative outperformance against the broader market, largely driven by the robust momentum in PSU Banks amid strong quarterly earnings and a broad-based positive trend across the sector, said Santosh Meena, Head of Research at Swastika Investmart. Notably, the Nifty PSU Bank index hit a fresh 52-week high of 9,093.65 in the early trading hours of January 20, before erasing all gains and falling more than 1.3 percent. Renewed institutional interest, RBI's support The analyst added that this resilience is further underpinned by renewed institutional interest, as mutual funds identify attractive valuations within the banking space, coupled with the RBI's prudent measures to ensure adequate systemic liquidity. Notably, the Reserve Bank of India delivered four interest rate cuts in 2025, reducing the benchmark repurchase rate by a cumulative 125 basis points. In June last year, the Indian central cut the cash reserve ratio (CRR), which refers to the funds that banks are required to hold, by 100 basis points to 3 percent. ""Given these structural supports, the index is poised to remain range-bound in the near term, likely consolidating within the 58,700–60,400 zone as it digests recent gains and builds a base for the next move,"" according to the analyst. Strong balance sheets The fact that Bank Nifty has been relatively less affected in the face of the market correction is a sign that the banking sector has strong balance sheets, steady credit growth, as well as greater earnings visibility, said Pranav Koomar, Founder and CEO of PlusCash. He however cautioned investors, stating that some correction cannot be ruled out, especially in case the general market slide continues. “Nonetheless, any fall in Bank Nifty will probably be more limited in extent, except in case of a drastic macro or liquidity surprise,” he added. Harshal Dasani, Business Head at INVasset PMS, meanwhile said that the relative resilience of the index so far reflects composition rather than immunity. “Unlike the Nifty 50, which has meaningful exposure to global cyclicals and rate-sensitive pockets, this index is tilted toward businesses with steadier cash flows, lower balance-sheet stress, and more domestic demand visibility. That has helped cushion volatility even as the broader market corrected,” he said. Going ahead, the divergence may narrow, but not necessarily through a sharp drawdown, the analyst said. “If global cues remain mixed and earnings momentum softens, some mean reversion is possible. However, a decline matching the Nifty 50 would typically require either earnings downgrades or a macro shock, neither of which is clearly visible yet. In a sideways or mildly corrective market, such indices tend to consolidate rather than correct aggressively. Resilience may moderate, but a one-to-one fall with the benchmark is not a base-case scenario at this stage,” he added. Technical view on Bank Nifty Bank Nifty is still holding its major support zone near 58,650, while Nifty has already broken its crucial support of 25,350–25,400, turning structurally weak, said Drumil Vithlani, Technical Analyst at Bonanza. He added that Bank Nifty remains in a sideways-to-positive range, whereas Nifty has shifted to a clear short-term downtrend after rejection from all-time highs. Bank Nifty is trading near/above its 20-week EMA, showing demand at lower levels, while Nifty has closed below its key EMA, indicating selling pressure, he added. RSI of Bank Nifty is healthier and holding above neutral, whereas Nifty’s RSI is weakening, confirming relative underperformance, he further said. The analyst concluded that Bank Nifty is consolidating and showing resilience, supported by PSU banks, while Nifty has already broken key supports and looks comparatively weaker. Bank Nifty continues to show relative outperformance, maintaining a bullish structure despite mild resistance near 60,200, said Emkay Global Financial Services. A sustained move above this level may fuel further upside, while the 59,200–58,900 zone is expected to act as a strong support cushion, the brokerage said. Axis Securities meanwhile said that Bank Nifty is centered around the 60,000 level, which is acting as a key pivot for the current expiry. 59,500 is a strong support zone, supported by heavy Put open interest, while 60,000 remains the major resistance, marked by the highest Call open interest, according to the domestic brokerage. ""Bank Nifty exhibited relative resilience near 59,800–60,000, but hesitation around 60,000 underscores indecision in the banking complex. A break above 60,000 could revive short-term bullish sentiment, while a breach of 59,500–59,600 might signal extended consolidation,"" said Choice Broking."
"Q3 Results impact: Havells India shares drop 7% as profit misses estimates; Aarti Surfactants, Tips Music jump up to 20%",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/q3-results-impact-havells-india-shares-drop-7-as-profit-misses-estimates-aarti-surfactants-tips-music-jump-up-to-20-13781861.html,"The shares of Havells India declined in trade sharply on January 20 after the company’s results for the October-December quarter of FY26 missed estimates on some fronts. Aarti Surfactants and Tips Music shares meanwhile surged. The three companies had released their results on January 19. Havells India Q3 Results: Havells India shares declined more than 7 percent to close at Rs 1,344.90 apiece. This comes a day after the company reported a standalone net profit of Rs 301.36 crore for Q3 FY26, marking a nearly 7 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise from Rs 282.81 crore in Q3 FY25 but a 5 percent QoQ decline from Rs 317.48 crore in Q2 FY26. The firm’s revenue from operations meanwhile rose more than 14 percent YoY to Rs 5,573.44 crore during the quarter under review. Along with the Q3 results, Havells India announced an interim dividend of Rs 4 per equity share. The record date to determine the eligibility of the shareholders set to receive the payment has been set on January 23. The dividend will then be paid to the eligible shareholders on or before February 17. Brokerages on Havells: Motilal Oswal reiterated its 'Neutral' rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,590 apiece. This implies an upside potential of nearly 10 percent from the stock’s previous closing price of Rs 1447.1 apiece. The domestic brokerage said that the company’s Q3 results came in below its estimates, as margins remained under pressure across the C&W, Lloyd, and cable segments. “Going forward, the inventory situation of RAC, the implementation of price hikes due to new BEE norms, RM cost inflation, and growth in the C&W segment amid copper price fluctuations will be the key monitorables,” it added. JM Financial said that the firm’s adjusted PAT was a “shade below expectations”, while EBITDA was in-line and revenue was above estimate. “Our FY26E EPS estimate goes up by 3%, primarily on the back of an increase in revenue from C&W, while our FY27/28E EPS estimate is largely unchanged. We maintain BUY with a PT of INR 1,750 (unchanged), valuing Havells at 50x Dec’27E EPS,” the brokerage said. Nomura kept a ‘Buy’ call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 1,798 per share. This implies an upside potential of more than 24 percent from the stock’s previous closing price of Rs 1,447.1 apiece. The international brokerage said that the firm’s Q3 earnings beat Jefferies kept a ‘Hold’ call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 1,555 per share. This implies an upside potential of nearly 7.5 percent over the stock’s previous closing price. The international brokerage said that the firm’s strong cables and wires growth offset weakness in Lloyd & Lighting. Rising copper and aluminium prices may require calibrated price hikes, it added. Aarti Surfactants Q3 Results: Aarti Surfactants shares jumped 20 percent to hit the upper circuit at Rs 459.10 apiece on Tuesday. This comes after the firm’s net profit grew 358 percent YoY to Rs 3.66 crore in Q3 FY26, from Rs 79.75 lakh in Q3 FY25. The firm’s revenue from operations meanwhile grew around 28 percent YoY to Rs 207.79 crore during the quarter under review. Tips Music Q3 Results: Tips Music shares rose more than 3 percent to close at Rs 536.10 apiece after the company. This came after the company’s net profit rose nearly 37 percent YoY to Rs 58.66 crore in Q3 FY26, from Rs 44.23 crore in Q3 FY25. The firm’s revenue from operations meanwhile rose over 21 percent YoY to Rs 94.29 crore during the quarter under review."

Click to View More Outlook for January 21 Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities Bears resumed control as bulls were increasingly marginalised amid ongoing transatlantic trade tensions. Supports looked fragile as the Nifty kept breaking them on the back of strong institutional selling. Indicators remained in a bearish crossover and are approaching the oversold zone. On the daily chart, the index appears to be drifting towards the 200-DMA. Immediate support is seen around 25,100–25,150. If this level holds, a decent pullback can be expected. Rajesh Bhosale, Equity Technical Analyst, Angel One On the weekly expiry day, Nifty began on a negative note and as prices broke below key support levels, a cascading sell-off ensued, leading to sharp declines through the session. Eventually, Nifty ended the day with a loss of 1.38%, closing tad above the 25200 mark. Over the last 15 days, Nifty has erased more than 1,100 points and in the process has broken multiple key support levels, indicating that weakness may persist in the near term. On the daily chart, prices have slipped below the November swing low and also closed below the golden retracement level (61.8%) of the entire upmove from the September swing low near 24600. On the indicators front, the RSI Smoothened has entered the oversold zone below 25 for the first time since August; however, considering the broad-based nature of the sell-off, attempting to catch the bottom may be premature. From a levels perspective, prices are now at a knocking distance of the long-term 200-DSMA, with 25100–25000 emerging as a crucial support zone for the coming sessions. On the flip side, given the sharpness of the recent decline, identifying a precise resistance zone is challenging; nevertheless, the 25500–25600 region is likely to act as a stiff hurdle. While oscillators are deeply oversold and prices have approached long-term support levels ahead of the key Budget session, we would prefer to remain cautious and not rush to call a bottom until clear reversal signals or a base formation emerge.

"Broader markets extend losses, fall up to 3%: Nifty Midcap 100 goes below 100-DMA; Ola, Oberoi Realty among top losers",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/broader-markets-extend-losses-fall-up-to-1-7-nifty-midcap-100-goes-below-100-dma-ola-oberoi-realty-among-top-losers-13780937.html,"The broader markets extended their losses in Tuesday’s session, mirroring the decline in the benchmark indices, Sensex and Nifty. The Nifty Midcap 100 and Nifty Smallcap 100 underperformed the frontline indices, falling by up to 3 percent, while the benchmark Sensex and Nifty also traded lower. The Nifty Midcap 100 slipped below its 100-day moving average (DMA) to 57,898.65 during intraday trade, with Oberoi Realty and UPL emerging as the biggest laggards. Shares of real estate companies declined sharply on Monday, led by losses in Oberoi Realty, as investor sentiment turned weak following the company’s Q3 earnings. Oberoi Realty reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 622.64 crore for the October–December quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026. This represented a marginal year-on-year increase of 0.69 percent from Rs 618.38 crore reported in Q3 FY25, but an 18 percent quarter-on-quarter decline from Rs 760.26 crore recorded in the previous quarter (Q2 FY26). The Nifty Smallcap 100 index extended its losing streak for a third consecutive session, falling over 4 percent during the period. Newgen Software Technologies, Data Patterns (India), Ola Electric Mobility and Aditya Birla Real Estate emerged as major laggards in the index, with their shares declining by as much as 12 percent. Shares of Ola Electric Mobility slipped 5.5 percent to Rs 33.7, hitting their lowest level in nearly a month, after the electric vehicle maker announced the resignation of its Chief Financial Officer Harish Abichandani due to personal reasons. The company said Deepak Rastogi has been appointed as the new CFO with effect from January 20. The stock marked its tenth consecutive session of decline and has fallen 57.7 percent so far in 2025. N ArunaGiri, CEO of TrustLine Holdings, said ""It has been a one-way fall for the small-cap index since the start of November last year. At the index level, small caps are down over 11.5% since then. That alone looks painful, but the reality beneath the surface is far worse. Even in the current month, from January 1st, the small-cap index has fallen by about 7.5%. And this is only the aggregate picture. When we go deeper, the stock-specific carnage is severe. A large number of stocks are down 40–50%. In fact, one could argue that nearly half the market, particularly across the small-cap spectrum, has seen drawdowns of this magnitude."" ""The pain in mid caps is equally intense. Given the extent of the fall and the brutality of the correction, the obvious question arises: Has this become a buy-on-dips market? Unfortunately, the answer is no. Valuations remain meaningfully above historical averages. Before this correction, the small-cap index was trading at around 28–30x trailing earnings. Post the fall, valuations have moderated to about 25–26x, but this is still a huge premium to long-term averages. So at a broader market level, small and mid caps continue to look expensive, and it would be naïve to rule out more pain in the space. Does that mean investors should simply sit on the fence and wait for much lower levels? That approach is equally not prudent. At the stock-specific level, for truly bottom-up and selective investors, many compelling opportunities are emerging across small and mid caps, provided one is extremely choosy. In that sense, this is not a universal buy-on-dips market, nor is it a market to completely stay out of. It is a market that rewards selective bottom-up stock-specific approach. That, in essence, is the story emerging from the current small- and mid-cap carnage. Time to be choosy, selective and bottom-up,"" he added. Extending its previous day's decline, the Sensex tumbled 1,065.71 points, or 1.28 percent to settle at 82,180.47. During the day, it dropped 1,235.6 points, or 1.48 percent to 82,010.58. The Nifty tanked 353 points, or 1.38 percent to end at 25,232.50, marking its steepest single day decline since April 7, 2025. The sharp fall dragged the index to its lowest closing level since October 15, 2025.

Pure cement realizations declined 5.3% QoQ mainly due to weak prices in the eastern region. Raw material costs remained elevated despite access to better-priced slag under long-term contracts, while power and fuel costs declined 9% YoY, aided by higher share of domestic coal in the mix. Consequently, EBITDA/t increased 39% YoY to Rs763 (vs. PLe of Rs775). While the recent uptick in pet coke prices poses a risk to margins in Q4FY26, management expects overall fuel costs to remain largely stable, aided by higher domestic coal usage, while cement price hikes implemented in January are holding so far amid improving demand. The Vadraj acquisition remains on track, with commissioning expected by Q1FY28, taking Nuvoco’s total cement capacity to ~35mtpa. Outlook We raise our EBITDA estimates by 2% on slightly higher volumes and expect it to deliver EBITDA CAGR of 19% over FY25-28E. The stock is trading at EV of 8.2x/6.8x FY27E/FY28E EBITDA.

Ports NSR declined 3.9% QoQ due to higher volumes from terminals having lower pricing. Overall cargo volume growth was supported by strong throughput at South West Port and Dharamtar, along with interim operations at Tuticorin and the JNPA liquid terminal, partly negated by lower iron ore and coal volumes at Paradip. Port EBITDA/t moderated as a higher share of volumes came from terminals having lower pricing. Growth in logistics, led by Navkar’s continued turnaround and strong EXIM and domestic volumes, mitigated the impact of softer port-level unit metrics.

Despite having negative seasonality in Capco, the organic growth (0.6% QoQ CC) was positive and multi-faceted across business units, including Fin. Services. However, the organic growth momentum is less likely to sustain in Q4 due to execution deferment in one of the large deals, especially the NN component. The softness in business is also baked into Q4 organic guidance of -1.5 to +0.5 QoQ CC (our assumption), which translates to twomonth inorganic contribution of +1.5% QoQ. Again, the organic guidance comes at the back of improving Capco seasonality in Q4, which is little discouraging. Although 9MFY26 large deals (+77% YoY) and bookings (+25% YoY) have improved, the execution remains a challenge. On the margins front, we expect the full integration of Harman will dilute Service margins in FY27 before it sees integration benefits achieved in FY28E. Outlook We are baking in revenue growth of -1.3%/+3.8/4.4% YoY CC, while keeping our Adj. IT Service margin estimates at 17.4%/17.1%/17.5% for FY26E/FY27E/FY28E, respectively.

The organic Service business grew 1.0% QoQ CC, while organic Auto business de-grew ~4-5% QoQ CC (our assumption). The engagement within Aerospace is progressing well and moving upstream to complex engineering activities, it now anticipates Aerospace to become USD40m revenue in FY26. The management was confident of reversing Q3 weakness and deliver double-digit growth in Q4 on the back of stabilizing operations of its Anchor account along with a ramp up in Auto programs (signed in Q3). The continued momentum in Aerospace & IHM, securing large program on full-vehicle development, and early signs of spending recovery in auto OEMs give confidence to the management to drive double-digit organic growth in FY27. However, we believe the high base in Q4 and the lumpiness in Tech Solutions pose incremental risks to achieving doubledigit growth, especially as the auto recovery remains in limbo. The BMW JV is progressing well and deployed 1000+ employees, adding further visibility for next year. Our organic growth for FY27/FY28 revised to 8.5%/11.9% (earlier 7.5%/12.9%) YoY CC.

BHEL delivered a revenue growth of 16.4% YoY with EBITDA margin expanding by 225bps YoY aided by lower other expenses (vs higher base in Q3FY25) partially offset by decrease in GM. Execution in the Power segment remained slower, translating into ~13% YoY revenue growth despite a healthy Rs1.7trn order backlog, supported by recent Rs66.5bn EPC package win (1×800MW) from NTPC, reinforcing BHEL’s positioning in the thermal space. In contrast, the industry segment continued to deliver strong execution with revenue up 27.4% YoY, driven by accelerating traction across transmission, transportation, oil & gas and defense verticals; however, order inflows in Industry moderated sharply to Rs16.3bn (vs. ~Rs57bn in Q3FY25 on a high base). While near-term challenges around execution intensity persist, a robust pipeline and a gradual shift towards non-Power opportunities with rise in public/private capex, BHEL is well placed for sustained growth.

Beyond selective pockets the growth was muted, especially BFSI and CMT verticals. The deal signing activities remain strong in these verticals, it will take few more quarters to achieve the normalized revenue run-rate for top marquee accounts. Although top 5/10 accounts de-grew 2.9%/1.1% TTM (vs decline of 5.2%/2.2% LQ), the pace of deceleration has reduced sequentially, implies recovery post productivity benefits. The management was confident of executing even better and aspired to achieve near to double-digit YoY growth in Q4. The company’s participation in vendor consolidation deals along with continued momentum in NN wins translate to a better growth visibility. The recent Indialed NN deal (CBDT) would itself contribute ~80-90bps to the topline in FY27.

Real estate stocks see worst day in six months; Oberoi Realty falls 9% over weak Q3 results: What lies ahead?,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/oberoi-realty-stock-falls-7-over-weak-q3-results-real-estate-index-falls-12-in-10-sessions-what-lies-ahead-13780917.html,"The shares of real estate companies declined in trade sharply on January 20, led by losses in Oberoi Realty as sentiment turned sour after the company’s Q3 results. The sharp fall in the share prices pushed the Nifty Realty index down more than 4 percent to 798.90, as seen at 1.50 pm, to emerge as the top sectoral loser today and recording decline for the third consecutive session. The sectoral index has now fallen for nine out of 10 sessions, dropping more than 13 percent during the period. The sectoral index is set to record the sharpest single-day plunge since July 2025. Oberoi Realty Q3 Results: Oberoi Realty on Monday reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 622.64 crore for the October-December quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026. This marked a marginal rise of 0.69 percent from the Rs 618.38 crore net profit reported in Q3 FY25, but an 18 percent QoQ fall from the Rs 760.26 crore net profit reported in the previous quarter (Q2 FY26). The firm’s revenue from operations meanwhile rose 6 percent YoY but fell more than 16 percent QoQ to Rs 1,492.64 crore during the quarter under review. Along with the Q3 results, Oberoi Realty announced a third interim dividend of Rs 2 per equity share for the financial year 2025-2026. The record date to determine the eligibility of the shareholders set to receive the payment has been set at January 23. The dividend will be paid to the eligible shareholders on or before February 5. ""In 2026, we will continue to actively pursue attractive land opportunities, and we remain optimistic about the year ahead, supported by a strong development pipeline, prudent capital management, and our unwavering focus on creating future ready projects aligned with long-term market demand,"" said Vikas Oberoi, Chairman & Managing Director of Oberoi Realty. JP Morgan remains 'Overweight' on the stock, with a target price of Rs 2,050 apiece which implies an upside potential of nearly 24 percent from the stock's previous closing price. The international brokerage said that the numbers are relatively weak. If pre-sales numbers continue to disappoint, the stock's outperformance could narrow, the firm added. Top realty losers today: Oberoi Realty shares were the top loser on the index, dropping around 9 percent to trade at Rs 1,510.90 apiece. Sobha, Prestige Estates and Macrotech Developers (Lodha) shares meanwhile fell around 6 percent each. Heavyweight Godrej Properties and DLF shares dropped around 5 percent and 3 percent, respectively. Anant Raj and Phoenix Mills shares fell around 3 percent each. Brigade Enterprises and Signature Global shares were trading in the red with marginal losses. What lies ahead? Indian IT sector has seen mass layoffs last year, which have now spilled over to this year. According to analysts, the IT layoffs have impacted housing demand in key areas, thereby impacting the stocks. IT layoffs are likely to be the major reason for the low demand in the luxury segment of urban centers like Bangalore and Hyderabad as they will be discouraging the high-income buyers, said Shashank Gupta, Director, RPS Group. He added that mid-to-premium housing sales, which have already dropped 15 percent year-on-year, will continue to be affected negatively as the professionals will not be willing to upgrade, opting instead to rent amid such job uncertainties. ""The market has whispered to the executives with Nifty Realty down by 20% from the peaks and talking about the disruption posed by the AI, which also indicates that 30% of the IT jobs that are luxury demand would get stifled due to the automation by 2027. The stock corrections that are expected to be around 5-7% are dependent on the RBI rate cuts and policy revamps that could fuel the market by the second quarter of 2026,"" the analyst said. Keshav Mangla, GM Business Development at Forteasia Realty, cited Anarock data to explain that financial tech layoffs of more than 1 lakh since 2024 have already resulted in a 12 percent drop in the demand for Tier-1 cities, thus resulting in developers' difficulties in managing cash flows and having to sell off their inventory.

The growth was broad-based across verticals, except BFSI (down 6.3%) on account of passing productivity benefits. Although Comviva seasonality contributed notably in Q3, the growth beyond Comms was encouraging (+1.2% QoQ), reported third consecutive quarter of growth. Management was confident of sustaining momentum within Comms in FY27, backed by NN 5-year strategic win (USD500m) with a European Telco that itself will contribute ~1% to the topline. The 9MFY26 deal TCV looks encouraging at USD2.7b (+44% YoY), which is coming over and above 42% YoY TCV growth delivered in FY25. The quarterly TCV run-rate of USD800m-USD1b is likely to be sustained, which is sufficient to achieve its aspiration of outpacing the peer average topline growth. We believe the restructuring exercise has largely calibrated margins to a comfort band, now it requires paddling more on the orchestrated large wins.

LTM TCV came in at $1.69bn (up 0.6% y/y) with a book-to-bill of 1.4x, while the LTM TCV stood at $6.5bn (up 12% y/y), driven by multi-year wins across managed services, modernisation, cyber, data, AI and AI-agent deployments, as the clients consolidate spend into fewer strategic partners and fund ‘run + modernize’ programs alongside targeted AI-led transformation. Whilst the growth was broadbased, it was skewed to Manufacturing & Resources (up 9.4% q/q) and Healthcare & Public Services (up 9.9%), with Europe (up 3.4%) and RoW (up 14.1%), driven by execution and wallet share gain in select pockets.

Buy JK Cement; target of Rs 7200: Choice Institutional Equities,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-jk-cement-target-of-rs-7200-choice-institutional-equities-13780624.html,"Choice Institutional Equities's report on JK Cement We maintain our BUY rating on JKCE, with a target price of INR 7,200. Key pillars of our investment thesis are: 1) Cement sector tailwinds, such as better demand and healthy pricing heading into Q4 and FY27, 2) Capacity expansion plan is on track with a potential to reach ~36+ Mnt by FY27 end (~28.7 Mnt as of December 2025 ), 3) Commitment to costefficiency through increasing adoption of green power, targeting 75% by FY30, 4) Disciplined leverage strategy, with net debt to EBITDA well below 2x and 5) ROCE expansion of ~495 bps over FY25–28E under reasonable operational assumptions. We employ a robust EV to CE (Enterprise Value to Capital Employed) based valuation framework, which allows us a rational basis to assign a valuation multiple which captures improving fundamentals. Outlook We arrive at a 1-year forward TP of INR 7,200/share for JKCE. We assign an EV/CE multiple of 3.7x/3.7x for FY27E/FY28E, which we believe is conservative, given expansion in ROCE from 11.2% in FY25 to 16.1% in FY28E. We did a sanity check of our EV/CE TP using implied EV/EBITDA, P/BV and P/E multiple. On our TP of INR 7,200 FY28E implied EV/EBITDA/PB/PE multiple is 17.3x/5.5x/31.2x.

"LTIMindtree shares crash 6% after Q3 results; brokerages flag margin risks, near-term earnings concerns",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/ltimindtree-shares-crash-6-after-q3-results-brokerages-flag-margin-risks-near-term-earnings-visibility-13780450.html,"Shares of LTIMindtree Ltd fell sharply in early trade on Tuesday, slipping over 6 percent, as investors reacted to mostly cautious brokerage reviews following the company’s Q3 FY26 results. Analysts flagged concerns around margins and near-term earnings visibility despite largely in-line performance. The stock was trading at Rs 6,012.5 in morning deals, down 6.2 percent on the day. Over the past one year, LTIMindtree shares have gained just over 3 percent, significantly underperforming the benchmark Nifty 50, which is up about 9 percent over the same period. Brokerages said that LTIMindtree delivered an in-line quarter, but diverged on the outlook and valuation comfort. CLSA reiterated its ‘Outperform’ rating with a target price of Rs 7,067 per share, implying an upside of over 17 percent. The brokerage expressed confidence in the company’s guidance for a return to double-digit revenue growth by Q4 FY26. CLSA pointed out strong large deal wins across BFSI, public markets, and consumer and media segments, noting that deal ramp-ups should offset productivity gains from AI adoption. However, it flagged limited scope for near-term re-rating, arguing that future upside will be driven primarily by EPS growth rather than valuation expansion. Morgan Stanley maintained an ‘Equal-weight’ stance with a target price of Rs 6,300, citing positives such as growth in a top hi-tech client and signs of BFSI bottoming out. At the same time, it cautioned that near-term margin pressure remains a concern, resulting in a balanced risk-reward at current valuations. More cautious views came from Nomura and Citi. Nomura retained a ‘Neutral’ rating with a target price of Rs 5,900, pointing to a Q3 performance ranging from in-line to a modest miss, with EBIT margin at 16.1 percent coming in below estimates. It also flagged the one-time labour law provision of Rs 590 crore as a key drag. Citi, which has a ‘Sell’ call and a target price of Rs 5,415, said revenue was aided by seasonal pass-throughs and margins benefited from lower SG&A expenses, but warned that upcoming wage hikes could dent margins by around 100 basis points over Q4 and Q1. LTIMindtree on Monday reported a 12 percent year-on-year decline in net profit to Rs 960 crore for the December quarter, largely due to a one-time labour code-related charge of Rs 590.3 crore. Sequentially, profit fell over 30 percent. Revenue rose 11 percent year-on-year to Rs 10,781 crore, while operating margin improved 20 basis points sequentially to 16.1 percent. Excluding the labour code impact, net profit would have grown 29 percent year-on-year, the company said. Management commentary remained constructive, with CEO and MD Venu Lambu highlighting strong deal momentum, AI-led strategy execution, and a third consecutive quarter of over 2 percent sequential growth.

"Hindustan Zinc shares jump 5% as soaring silver prices boost Q3 results: Should you buy, sell or hold?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/hindustan-zinc-shares-jump-2-as-soaring-silver-prices-boost-q3-results-should-you-buy-sell-or-hold-13780404.html,"The shares of Hindustan Zinc rose more than 5 percent to fresh record high on January 20 as brokerages issued positive notes for the Vedanta Group company after it released results for the third quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026. The shares of the company hit a new 52-week high of Rs 696.90 apiece in the morning trading hours of Tuesday. Hindustan Zinc Q3 results: Hindustan Zinc on January 19 reported a standalone net profit of Rs 3,879 crore for the October-December quarter of FY26. This marked a 46.5 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise from the Rs 2,647 crore net profit reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year. Revenue from operations meanwhile rose 27.5 percent YoY to Rs 10,922 crore during the quarter under review, as against a revenue of Rs 8,556 crore in the year-ago period. EBITDA increased 34.7 percent YoY to Rs 6,055 crore, while EBITDA margin expanded to 55 percent from 52 percent a year ago, supported by lower zinc cost of production and improved operating leverage. According to the company, Q3 marked its highest-ever quarterly revenue and profit, driven by higher metal production, stronger zinc and silver prices, and a sharp reduction in costs. Soaring silver prices: Silver prices hit fresh lifetime highs today, as tensions between US and EU simmered over President Donald Trump’s constant threats to annex Greenland. Silver futures with March expiry gained around 3 percent to hit a fresh all time high of Rs 3,18,729 per kilogram. The future contracts with May and July expiries meanwhile rose more than 3 percent to hit fresh lifetime highs of Rs 3,28,854 per kilogram and Rs 3,35,885 per kilogram, respectively. Hindustan Zinc is the largest producer of silver in India, and produces refined silver with a minimum 99.9 percent purity. HSBC on Hindustan Zinc: HSBC kept a ‘Buy’ call on the shares of Hindustan Zinc, with a target price of Rs 750 per share. This implies an upside potential of nearly 14 percent from the stock’s previous closing price of Rs 660.4 apiece. The company’s Q3 earnings beat estimates due to higher volumes and lower costs, HSBC said. It added that strong silver prices should further lift earnings. The firm expects Q4 results to be even stronger due to higher volumes and sharply higher silver prices. Jefferies on Hindustan Zinc: Jefferies raised its target price for the stock to Rs 750 per share, while maintaining its ‘Buy’ rating. The latest target price implies an upside potential of nearly 14 percent from the previous closing price. The international brokerage said that the firm benefitted from rising silver and zinc prices. It raised FY26-28 EPS estimates by 3–10 percent, as costs remain under control. It expects the company to post 47 percent YoY EPS Growth in FY27, followed by 6 percent In FY28. Jefferies further said that Hindustan Zinc’s valuation at 9.4x FY27 EV/EBITDA as against a long-term average of 7.3x is justified by rising silver share in EBIT. Citi on Hindustan Zinc: Citi however kept its ‘Sell’ call on the stock with a target price of Rs 585 per share, which implies a downside potential of more than 11 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. The firm said that Hindustan Zinc’s Q3 EBITDA rose 35 percent YoY driven by better silver prices, lower costs & higher volumes. The company is targeting 2 percent refined volume growth in FY26 & CoP of $1,000. Nuvama on Hindustan Zinc: Nuvama kept a ‘Reduce’ call on Hindustan Zinc shares, with a target price of Rs 591 apiece. This implies a downside potential of more than 10.5 percent over the stock’s previous closing price. The international brokerage said that the firm’s Q3 EBITDA was in-line with its estimates. Silver EBIT surged 56 percent QoQ, and accounted for 44 percent of EBIT. Nuvama lifted its EBITDA estimates by 28 percent for FY27 and 21 percent for FY28, assuming that the average zinc and silver prices of $3,000 and $60 for FY27, and $2,900 and $55 for FY28, respectively. The firm however said that Hindustan Zinc’s valuation is expensive at 11.1x FY28 EV/EBITDA. Follow all LIVE updates from the stock markets here."
LTIMindtree Q3 FY26 – Is the price already discounting the strong quarter?,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/moneycontrol-research/ltimindtree-q3-fy26-is-the-price-already-discounting-the-strong-quarter-13780264.html,"Highlights LTIMindtree (LTIM, CMP: Rs 6407, Market Cap: Rs 189,960 crore, Rating: Overweight) reported a good Q3 FY26 with a strong sequential surge in revenue despite the seasonality, uptick in margin, and steady deal flow. The management remains optimistic about clocking close to double-digit YoY growth in revenue in Q4 and maintaining the momentum in FY27. The stock has been an out-performer in the IT pack and has performed in line with the Nifty in the past year. While the headline valuation isn’t cheap, the growth journey makes us constructive.  Strong surge in revenue Revenue for the last reported quarter Q3 FY26 at $1208 million represented a sequential growth of 2.4 percent in reported currency and in Constant Currency (CC).  The reporting quarter (Q3FY26) saw strong performance from Healthcare, Life Sciences & Public Services, followed by Manufacturing & Resources. The Consumer business had a positive sequential growth. Weakness was seen in BFSI (banking financial service and insurance) and Technology, Media & Communication because of a combination of furloughs and productivity passthrough in some top accounts.  All the three key markets of North America, Europe, and the Rest of the World (RoW) had a positive sequential growth. The PAN deal from India had a positive rub-off on RoW.  Weakness in top accounts transitory  Unlike the strength in the overall business, the top 5 accounts (which include the top hitech and BFSI account) de-grew YoY 8.7 percent and a sequential 2.9 percent in Q3 FY26. The temporary impact has been on account of recalibration as LTIM has passed on AI-driven productivity gains to customers. The top hi-tech account has started growing sequentially and the BFSI segment and the top account is likely to bottom out in Q4. The impact of the AI-led productivity gains is more meaningful in large engagements and the management expects growth momentum from these large accounts to resume from FY27. Guiding to margin stability LTIM’s EBIT margin expanded 20 basis points QoQ in Q3 FY26 to 16.1 percent. Tailwinds from the Fit-for-Future efficiency gains programme and forex were partially offset by furloughs and lower working days. The management remains confident of sustaining margin improvement supported by levers, including AI-driven productivity gains, pyramid optimisation through fresher hiring, and continued cost discipline. It has started a new programme called New Horizon for steady focus on cost and margin. The likely wage hike in Q4 to be spread over two quarters is likely to cause 1 percent margin headwind each quarter.  LTIM reported a net headcount addition of 1,511 employees in Q3FY26, including 1736 freshers, taking the total workforce to 87,958. This further bolsters confidence on future execution. Gaining the AI edge The key initiatives from LTIM are launching ""Blueverse Studios"" in Mumbai and London as AI collaboration hubs for clients. The company has completed the GenAI Foundation training programme for 80,000 employees and has won multiple AI-specific deals, including developing agentic solutions and GenAI-based platforms for global clients. Bookings steady The Q3FY26 order book TCV (total contract value) stood at $1.69 billion, flat YoY but up by over 6 percent sequentially. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter with TCV above $ 1.5 billion.  The management remains optimistic about achieving close to double-digit USD revenue growth in Q4 and maintaining the momentum, supported by robust deal wins, strong execution, continued operational efficiencies and opportunities arising from AI. Thanks to the outperformance, the stock isn’t cheap, but the growth trajectory warrants attention of long-term investors.

Track the latest updates on GIFT Nifty right here on Moneycontrol. Indian equities began the week on a subdued note, with the Nifty falling below 25,500 intraday as weak global cues triggered broad-based profit booking. The renewed concerns over a potential global trade war and mixed earnings weighed on sentiment. However, select buying in FMCG and auto stocks provided support, helping the benchmarks recover from the day’s lows. At close, the Sensex was down 324.17 points or 0.39 percent at 83,246.18, and the Nifty was down 108.85 points or 0.42 percent at 25,585.50. GIFT Nifty (Up) The GIFT Nifty is trading higher at around 25,605.50, indicating a positive start for the day. Asian Equities (Down) Asia-Pacific markets traded subdued as Japan’s long-dated government bond yields hit new highs, with investors also weighing renewed U.S. tariff threats tied to Greenland.  US Equities (Shut) US equity markets were closed on Monday for Martin Luther King Jr. Day. US Bond Yield (Up) Treasuries joined a selloff in global bonds on Tuesday as escalating trade tensions spurred by proposed US tariffs relating to Greenland undermined demand for American assets. The yield curve bear steepened as cash trading resumed following a US holiday, with 10- and 30-year yields both climbing three basis points in early Asia trading.  Dollar Index (Slips) The dollar retreated to its lowest level in a week in early trading on Monday after threats from the White House towards the European Union over the future of Greenland triggered a broad selloff across U.S. stocks and government bonds.  Asian Currencies (Mixed) The won slips as South Korea’s stock benchmark looks set to end a 12 day rally, with fading risk appetite from US Europe tensions and firm dollar demand underpinning the exchange rate. The yen edged higher against the dollar, gaining as much as 0.2% to 157.85.  Crude (Up) Oil prices rose on Tuesday after better-than-expected economic growth data from China lifted demand optimism, with markets also watching President Donald Trump's threats of increased U.S. tariffs on European nations over his desire to buy Greenland.  Gold (Flat) The precious metals trade flat, after rising sharply in the previous session following Trump’s pledge to put tariffs on eight European nations that opposed his Greenland ambitions.  Fund Flow Action Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) extended their selling streak for the 10th consecutive session on January 19, offloading equities worth approximately Rs 3,262 crore, while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) remained net buyers with purchases of around Rs 4,234 crore.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Tata Elxsi, Colgate Palmolive, Shriram Finance, Canara Bank, CCL Products, and others on January 20?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-tata-elxsi-colgate-palmolive-shriram-finance-canara-bank-ccl-products-and-others-on-january-20-13779904.html,"Equity benchmarks declined four-tenths of a percent on January 19, with market breadth consistently favouring bears. About 2,190 shares were under pressure against 728 shares that advanced on the NSE. The market is expected to consolidate and trade within the previous week’s range. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi Bajaj Auto | CMP: Rs 9,429.5  Bajaj Auto has entered a healthy pullback phase after breaking out above its long-term falling trendline, as visible on the chart. Such pullbacks are often considered constructive, as they allow prices to consolidate and attract fresh buying interest without damaging the overall trend structure. From an indicator perspective, the Directional Movement Index (DMI) shows the positive line clearly in control, suggesting that buying strength remains dominant. The Average Directional Index (ADX) is holding above the 20 level, indicating that the trend is gaining stability and strength rather than weakening. Meanwhile, the MACD remains above the zero line, reflecting positive momentum and supporting the continuation of the bullish trend. Based on this technical combination, the pullback is viewed as an opportunity rather than a sign of weakness. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 9,450–9,400 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 10,200 Stop-Loss: Rs 9,000 Balkrishna Industries | CMP: Rs 2,431.6  Balkrishna Industries has shown a strong improvement in its technical structure, supported by multiple bullish signals. The 9- and 26-DEMA have delivered a bullish crossover, indicating a shift in short-term momentum in favour of the bulls. In addition, the stock has confirmed a breakout above its falling trendline, suggesting a change in the medium-term trend. Momentum indicators further strengthen the positive outlook. The DMI has recorded a bullish crossover, reflecting increasing buying pressure, while the MACD has moved above the zero line, highlighting a transition into positive momentum territory. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 2,410–2,400 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,600 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,300 Tata Elxsi | CMP: Rs 5,563  Tata Elxsi has successfully retested its breakout zone, as highlighted on the chart, confirming the strength and sustainability of the recent breakout. Notably, volumes are picking up near lower levels, indicating strong accumulation interest and reinforcing the positive price structure. The breakout above the falling trendline further supports a shift in the medium-term trend from bearish to bullish. On the momentum front, the MACD is positioned above the zero line, signalling positive momentum, while the DMI continues to reflect bullish dominance. Additionally, the ADX is holding above the 25 level, suggesting that the emerging trend is gaining strength and reliability. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 5,600–5,500 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 6,250 Stop-Loss: Rs 5,200 Jay Thakkar, Vice President & Head of Derivatives and Quant Research at ICICI Securities Colgate Palmolive India | CMP: Rs 2,178  Colgate Palmolive has provided a breakout from the falling trendline, accompanied by a decrease in open interest, indicating short covering. There had been heavy short positions in the stock, and it had declined nearly 50 percent from its all-time high. Significant positive divergence is visible on both daily and weekly charts, indicating a higher probability of continued short covering. The risk-to-reward ratio is clearly in favour of the bulls; hence, one may initiate long positions in this series. Options data indicates that the Rs 2,200 strike has the highest Call base, and a close above this level could lead to further upward momentum. Buy Colgate Palmolive futures in the range of Rs 2,170–2,190. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,250, Rs 2,300 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,120 Mankind Pharma | CMP: Rs 2,117.2  Mankind Pharma has been forming lower tops and lower bottoms, with an increase in open interest clearly indicating short build-up in the near term. Hence, the short-term trend remains negative. A bounce witnessed a few weeks ago was largely due to short covering, and once that move ended, the stock resumed its primary downtrend, with fresh additions on the short side. There is a huge Call base at the Rs 2,200 strike, and the stock has closed significantly below this level. The maximum pain is also at the Rs 2,200 level. Until this level is decisively crossed, the short-term trend is likely to remain weak. Any bounce should be utilised as a selling opportunity. Sell Mankind Pharma futures in the range of Rs 2,120–2,140. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 2,060, Rs 2,020 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,180 HCL Technologies | CMP: Rs 1,716.8  HCL Tech has been moving higher following its Q3 results, indicating a bullish short-term trend. There has been a decrease in open interest along with a rise in price, suggesting short covering. Large-cap IT stocks have largely witnessed short build-up, with heavyweights such as Wipro, TCS, and Infosys still carrying substantial short positions. Meanwhile, midcap IT stocks have been outperforming large caps. Despite this, HCL Tech has emerged as an outperformer within the large-cap IT space and has been gradually forming higher tops and higher bottoms. As per options data, once the stock closes above the Rs 1,720 level, which has the highest Call base, it is likely to move towards the Rs 1,800 level. Buy HCL Tech futures in the range of Rs 1,700–1,720. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,760, Rs 1,800 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,645 Vidnyan S Sawant, Head of Research at GEPL Capital Shriram Finance | CMP: Rs 1,010.35  Shriram Finance continues to exhibit a robust structural uptrend across timeframes, characterised by a classical higher-top and higher-bottom price formation. On the weekly timeframe, the stock is firmly placed above its key 12- and 26-week EMAs, underscoring strong trend strength. The MACD momentum indicator is trending higher, reflecting acceleration in upside momentum and reinforcing the bullish bias. On the daily chart, the stock has displayed a bullish mean reversion from the 12-day DEMA, further validating the positive outlook and suggesting continuation of the prevailing uptrend. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,081 Stop-Loss: Rs 970 Canara Bank | CMP: Rs 156.86  Canara Bank has recently displayed strong positive structural developments on the higher timeframe. During the October series, the stock witnessed a decisive breakout above its multi-year swing highs of 2010 and 2024, marking a transition into uncharted territory. The stock is firmly sustaining above its 12-, 26-, and 50-period DEMA, while continuing to form higher tops and higher bottoms, highlighting strong relative strength amid prevailing market volatility. Momentum indicators further validate this strength, with the MACD remaining in buy mode, reinforcing that the ongoing uptrend is well supported by positive momentum. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 172 Stop-Loss: Rs 150 Bharat Electronics | CMP: Rs 412.8  BEL has been in a robust long-term uptrend since 2020, consistently demonstrating resilience on the monthly timeframe. On the weekly chart, the stock continues to form higher bottoms and is currently consolidating around its 26-week EMA, indicating healthy price digestion within an ongoing uptrend. On the daily timeframe, BEL maintains a higher-top and higher-bottom structure. Notably, during recent pullbacks, the stock has displayed a repetitive price behaviour wherein corrections tend to remain contained at around 4 percent, after which the stock resumes its upward trajectory. This recurring pattern reinforces the strength of the prevailing trend. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 447 Stop-Loss: Rs 400 CCL Products India | CMP: Rs 983.75  CCL Products has been on a sustained upward trajectory since 2020, forming a sequence of higher tops and higher bottoms on the monthly timeframe, a classic indication of a long-term bullish trend. On the weekly chart, the stock has exhibited a bullish mean reversion from the 26-week EMA, while the Stochastic oscillator remains in buy mode, reinforcing the positive outlook. On the daily timeframe, the stock has witnessed a reversal from the 2025 gap support, further validating the underlying strength and confirming a constructive near-term sentiment. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,101 Stop-Loss: Rs 944"

"India’s healthcare deals top Rs 10,000 crore in Q2FY26 as hospitals, diagnostics lead expansion: EY",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/india-s-healthcare-deals-top-rs-10-000-crore-in-q2fy26-as-hospitals-diagnostics-lead-expansion-ey-13779668.html,"Indian healthcare sector delivered one of its strongest quarters in recent years, clocking over Rs 10,000 crore in M&A transactions in Q2 FY26, underpinned by rising demand for high‑acuity care, rapid diagnostics expansion and aggressive capacity additions by leading hospital chains, EY‑Parthenon said in its quarterly sector update. Deal activity remained broad‑based across hospitals, diagnostics and specialty care, comprising buyouts, minority investments and cross‑border acquisitions. Private equity and strategic investors continued to chase scalable regional platforms with strong clinical depth and technology‑enabled models, EY said. Hospitals to add 18,000 Beds High‑end clinical specialties—oncology, cardiology, neurology and gastroenterology—drove a sharp pickup in patient volumes and pricing power across the sector. Average revenue per occupied bed rose 10–16% year‑on‑year among large chains, aided by higher case complexity and tighter pricing discipline. India’s biggest networks are in the middle of their most ambitious expansion cycle yet, with plans to add over 18,000 beds in the next three to five years. Apollo Hospitals, Max, Aster, NH, KIMS and several mid‑market chains reported double‑digit revenue growth, stable to rising occupancy and stronger international patient flows. Digital and home‑care‑led revenues contributed as much as 25–30 percent for some operators. Diagnostics leads growth Diagnostics chains again outperformed, recording 10–22 percent revenue growth. Several players posted EBITDA margins in the 25–35 percent range, benefiting from scale efficiencies and an accelerated shift toward genomics, molecular testing and oncology diagnostics. Preventive and wellness packages contributed up to 26% of quarterly revenue for select chains, reflecting rising out‑of‑pocket spending and deeper penetration into Tier‑3 and Tier‑4 cities. Industry consolidation continued, with integration of recent acquisitions—Core Diagnostics, DAPIC, Scientific Pathology—progressing across networks. Franchise‑led expansion in smaller towns remained a significant growth lever. Specialty hospitals, med‑tech see sustained momentum Single‑specialty chains, including oncology and mother‑and‑child operators, reported steady improvement in occupancy, driven by clinician additions and capacity expansion in fast‑growing clusters. Medical device companies delivered healthy revenue growth backed by capacity commissioning and global acquisitions in cardiology and orthopedics. Investor appetite strong despite valuation premiums Healthcare assets continued to command premium valuations, with listed-company EV/EBITDA multiples ranging from the mid‑teens to above 30x, EY said. Investors increasingly favored integrated platforms and tech‑enabled offerings, while also pushing portfolio companies to expand into Tier‑2 and Tier‑3 markets. “Q2 FY26 reinforces the structural strength of India’s healthcare sector,” said Kaivaan Movdawalla, National Healthcare Leader at EY‑Parthenon. “The clear shift toward high‑acuity care and the rapid rise of advanced diagnostics reflect a sector poised for long‑term, durable growth.” Outlook EY expects momentum to remain firm through FY26, supported by rising consumption, expanding insurance penetration and newly commissioned hospital capacity coming on stream. While margin pressure may persist for new assets, medium‑term fundamentals remain robust, the firm said. “Investor interest is set to remain strong as strategic and financial buyers build long‑term exposure to the sector,” said Amit Gupta, Partner – Healthcare & Life Sciences Investment Banking at EY. “Scalable platforms with strong unit economics and clear expansion pathways will command sustained premiums.” Some important deals in recent times Manipal Hospitals completed a full buyout of Sahyadri Hospitals from OTPP for Rs 5300 crore as part of its ongoing multi‑specialty expansion strategy, while Baby Memorial Hospital acquired a majority stake in Meitra Hospital for Rs 1000-Rs 1200 crore, adding a premium tertiary‑care platform to its portfolio. Fortis Healthcare strengthened its North India cluster with the Rs 470‑crore acquisition of Shrimann Hospitals in Punjab, even as Narayana Hrudayalaya made its first major overseas move with a £183‑million acquisition of Practice Plus Group Hospitals in the UK, marking its entry into that market. Yatharth Hospital also expanded its regional presence through a Rs 260‑crore purchase of a 150‑bed hospital in Agra from the local promoter group, further consolidating its footprint in North India."

Sun Pharma terms $10-billion Organon buy report as 'speculative',https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/sun-pharma-terms-10-billion-organon-buy-report-as-speculative-13779506.html,"Sun Pharma on Monday called the news report about the company evaluating $10-billion acquisition of US drugmaker Organon as ""speculative"". ""The information set out in the article is speculative in nature and there is no material event or information that requires disclosure,"" Sun Pharma said in a statement to stock exchanges. The Economic Times on Monday reported citing people familiar with the matter that Sun Pharma is evaluating a takeover of Organon & Co. in a transaction that could be valued at about $10 billion including debt, a move that would mark the biggest overseas acquisition ever by an Indian drugmaker. The report said the deal would give India’s largest pharmaceutical company by market value a stronger commercial base in the US—its largest market—and expand its presence in women’s health and the fast‑growing biosimilars segment. Organon, spun off from Merck in 2021 with a sizeable debt load, has been divesting assets to streamline its balance sheet and refocus on core biopharma operations. Its market value has more than halved over the past year, prompting renewed buyer interest, the newspaper reported. Sun Pharma has hired a European bank to help structure financing for the potential acquisition, ET said. While discussions have picked up as Organon’s share price weakened, there is no certainty the talks will result in a transaction. The buyer may consider an all‑cash bid or a combination of stock and cash, ET reported, adding that rival interest could still emerge. For Sun, the deal would represent its boldest global move since its purchase of Ranbaxy Laboratories in 2014. The potential acquisition of Organon would allow the drugmaker to significantly expand its US scale in specialty and branded medicines, while also broadening its women’s health footprint—a category where Organon has long‑established leadership. The deal would further strengthen Sun’s position in the consolidated global biosimilars market, giving it access to Organon’s portfolio developed with Samsung Bioepis, and diversify its US operations beyond dermatology and ophthalmology into higher‑margin therapeutic areas. Absorbing Organon could also help Sun accelerate its shift toward higher‑margin branded and specialty products in the US market, where it has launched several innovative therapies over the past few years. Investor anticipation around a potential sale has already driven Organon’s shares up 28% over the past month, reversing part of the steep losses the stock suffered earlier. Organon generated $6.4 billion in revenue in FY24, while its biosimilar portfolio, developed with Samsung Bioepis, contributed around $660 million last year. The US drugmaker inherited $9.5 billion in debt at its 2021 spin‑off and still carried $8.9 billion in borrowings by Q2 2025. It has been actively selling assets to cut leverage. It recently sold its postpartum hemorrhage device to Laborie Medical—to pivot more aggressively toward women’s health biopharma and biosimilars."

The intraday market texture is volatile and non-directional; hence, level-based trading would be the ideal strategy for day traders. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The Nifty remained under bearish control, with the index sustaining below the 20 EMA throughout the session. Intraday volatility persisted, and every rise was sold into. The RSI continued in a bearish crossover and trended lower as the index closed at a multi-day low. Market fear remained elevated, as reflected by a spike in India VIX. In the near term, the index may continue to drift lower, with a potential downside target around 25,200, while resistance is placed near 25,700.

Increase in NIM was organic in nature driven by (1) fall in higher cost liabilities (2) reducing share of interest-bearing liabilities (3) better investment yield and (4) CRR cut. Driven by positive surprise, liability repricing and superior balance sheet mix, we raise NIM by 5bps each for FY27/28E. Asset calibration is progressing well; CoB/BuB/gold saw good growth in Q3FY26; while corporate accretion was healthy it was not NIM dilutive as focus is on mid-corporates. We are watchful of opex and transition to ECL. Outlook We raise core PAT for FY27/2E by avg. 4.0%.

On the NSE, the stock declined 2.7 percent to hit an intraday low of Rs 439 per share. The scrip has been under pressure for the past two sessions and has slipped nearly 4 percent during the period. Antique Stockbroking, in its note, said Lenskart is scaling up at a fast pace with improving profitability in a favourable industry environment. It pointed out that only about 24 percent of India’s eyewear market is organised, while other markets also offer significant growth opportunities. The brokerage highlighted the company’s technology-led approach and centralised supply chain, which it said enable higher operational efficiency and more consistent product quality. It added that there is sufficient headroom for around 25 percent compound annual revenue growth in the medium term, but noted that current valuations largely factor in the growth outlook. Lenskart had made a weak stock market debut in November 2025, listing at a discount of around 3 percent to its issue price. The company’s initial public offer, which was open for subscription from October 31 to November 4, was subscribed 28.26 times. Shares of Lenskart Solutions Ltd were listed at Rs 395 apiece on the NSE, a discount of 1.74 percent from the IPO price. The Rs 7,278-crore IPO was priced in the range of Rs 382 to Rs 402 per share.

The stock climbed 4.15 percent to an intraday high of Rs 7,417 on the NSE, marking one of its strongest single-day gains in the past month. Shares of the company had ended nearly 3 percent lower on Friday. The wires and cables maker reported a 36 percent year-on-year rise in consolidated profit for the third quarter, while revenue jumped 46 percent. According to brokerage firm Jefferies, the company posted strong December-quarter volume growth of around 40 percent year-on-year in the cables and wires segment, driven by market share gains, private capital expenditure, housing demand and restocking. The brokerage, however, noted that margins were impacted during the quarter as the company did not fully pass on the rise in commodity prices in order to protect demand. Jefferies estimates a compound annual growth rate of 25 percent in profit after tax over FY25–FY28, led by volume growth and improvement in margins in the fast-moving electrical goods segment.

"Yes Bank shares fall 3% today after Q3 results; brokerages bearish on growth, returns",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/yes-bank-ltd-shares-fall-3-today-after-q3-results-brokerages-bearish-on-growth-returns-13778914.html,"Shares of Yes Bank fell nearly 3 percent in early trade on Monday despite the lender reporting a sharp jump in fiscal third quarter net profit, as brokerages flagged concerns over weak credit growth, sub-par returns and valuation comfort, and largely maintained their bearish stance on the stock. Yes Bank stock was trading at Rs 22.78 in the afternoon session, down 2.9 percent, even as the private sector lender posted a 55 percent year-on-year rise in standalone net profit for Q3 FY26, aided by a sharp reduction in provisions. Over the past one year, Yes Bank shares are still up over 20 percent, outperforming the benchmark Nifty 50’s roughly 10 percent gain. Profit jump fails to reassure Street Yes Bank’s Q3 profit growth was driven largely by a steep 91 percent year-on-year fall in provisions, helping lift return on assets to around 0.9 percent. However, several brokerages said that the improvement was not backed by a meaningful acceleration in core growth or sustainable returns. Anand Rathi said retail stress remains visible and return on equity continues to be sub-par, adding that the profit uptick was largely a function of lower provisioning rather than a structural improvement in earnings quality. Emkay Global maintained its ‘Sell’ rating with a target price of Rs 20, citing anemic credit growth of around 5 percent year-on-year, dragged by the retail segment. The brokerage said the bank remains dependent on recoveries from non-performing assets to drive profitability, while growth and return metrics continue to lag peers. Emkay also flagged elevated valuations, noting that the stock trades at about 1.4 times FY27 estimated adjusted book value, which it considers demanding given the weak growth profile and modest return outlook. While management commentary suggests that corporate portfolio consolidation may be largely behind and growth could improve, Emkay said it remains cautious, pointing to the possibility of another round of portfolio clean-up following potential top management changes. Citi adds to caution; analyst ratings show bearishness Citi, which also has a ‘Sell’ stance on the stock, acknowledged the bank’s efforts to reconstruct stressed assets and improve net interest margins. However, the brokerage said it is closely monitoring the Supreme Court hearing related to the AT-1 bonds case, which remains an overhang. According to LSEG data cited by Reuters, the stock is currently rated ‘Sell’ on average by 11 analysts, with a median target price of Rs 18, implying downside from current levels. While brokerages broadly agree that Yes Bank has made progress on asset quality and balance-sheet clean-up since its reconstruction, they remain unconvinced about the sustainability of earnings improvement without a sharper pickup in loan growth and a clearer path to higher returns.

NIM was weaker due to utilization of investments over cash towards lending, following CRR cut and incremental credit growth being led by corporate and mortgages. Fees were lesser due to weak unsecured growth and competitive pressure on loan related fees. Provisions were a drag due to one-time Rs12.8bn impact related to PSL non-compliance of Rs200- 250bn loans following RBI annual review. Two key concerns were dragging stock performance (1) lower loan growth and (2) extension of MD&CEO, Mr. Bakshi’s term. Loan growth has picked-up; bank expects this momentum to continue. Board has approved Mr. Bakshi’s term for 2 years till Sep’28 which alleviates KMP risk. With industry best expected core RoA of 2.2% for FY28E.

We expect a further pick-up in retailled growth and stable asset quality resulting in RoE to remain >15%.

"We can launch a new drug every 2 or 3 years, Wockhardt chairman Khorakiwala",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/we-can-launch-a-new-drug-every-2-or-3-years-wockhardt-chairman-khorakiwala-13778531.html,"Drugmaker Wockhardt expects the next decade to be a defining phase for its innovation strategy, with the company preparing to roll out a steady stream of novel antibiotics to tackle drug resistance, a growing are of concern among doctors and patients alike. Chairman Dr Habil Khorakiwala has told Moneycontrol that Wockhardt has five to six new drugs slated for launch over the next four to five years and has more in early stages of development. ""So, we will have every two years, three years, a new drug coming out for the next 10 to 15 years. I have another two or three drugs which we have not even announced, which are in early stages,"" he said on the sidelines of an industry event in Mumbai recently. The portfolio, internally referred to as the “next wave of pipeline assets”, stays firmly anchored in antibiotics, an area big pharma has abandoned due to low commercial returns. Wockhardt chose a “white‑space strategy” in anti‑infectives, where global players have pulled back and resistance levels are rising sharply, creating both medical need and market opportunity, Khorakiwala said. “Why would we give up a lead we already have?” he said, adding Wockhardt plans to remain exclusively focused on antibiotics for the next 10–20 years. Wockhardt's antibiotic pipeline is focused heavily on multi-drug resistant (MDR) infections, with novel agents such as Zaynich (Zidebactam/Cefepime) currently seeking USFDA approval. WCK 6777 (Odrate), a once-daily outpatient treatment for complex infections such as those of the urinary tract and intra-abdominal, has received USFDA Fast Track designation. The company also has early-stage candidates such as WCK 771 and WCK 2349, and the recently launched Indian respiratory antibiotic Miqnaf (Nafithromycin), all targeting critical unmet needs for severe bacterial infections. The company also has WCK 4282, branded as Foviscu, undergoing clinical trials. Zaynich’s review status Khorakiwala said Zaynich’s new drug application (NDA) is under a six–to eight–month Fast Track USFDA review, with expected approval by mid‑2026, and he is “very confident of a positive outcome” for the drug aimed at life-threatening multi-drug resistant “superbugs”. Khorakiwala said the company is evaluating various strategies to take its pipeline global: building its own commercial footprint in markets such as the US for injectable hospital antibiotics, and selectively pursuing partnerships or licensing deals if the economics justify it. Wockhardt has appointed a merchant banker and is holding discussions with potential partners, though Khorakiwala insists the company will commercialise products independently if valuations do not reflect the scientific value created. Developing a commercial organisation is “far easier” than building a research engine, particularly since the company’s new drugs are aimed at tertiary-care, high-end hospitals that require focused sales teams of “50–100 people” in the US market, Khorakiwala said. He also positioned Wockhardt’s antibiotic research as a strategic national asset, saying India could become a global leader if the government directs funding and regulatory reforms toward organisations with demonstrated innovation capability. The company has called for streamlining Phase 3 approvals, which take nearly two years in India compared to five to six months in the US and Europe."

Wipro shares crash 7% as weak Q3 guidance outweighs steady operations; brokerages split on stock outlook,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/wipro-shares-crash-7-as-weak-q3-guidance-outweighs-steady-operations-brokerages-split-on-stock-outlook-13778256.html,"Wipro Ltd shares tumbled nearly 7 percent in Monday’s morning trade to around Rs 249, extending their recent underperformance, as investors reacted to weaker-than-expected near-term guidance issued alongside the company’s Q3 results late Friday. The selloff reflects investor concerns despite relatively steady operational performance in the fiscal third quarter. Today's fall adds to Wipro’s weak longer-term showing. The stock is down about 17.3 percent over the past year, sharply lagging the Nifty 50’s roughly 10 percent gain over the same period. For the quarter ended December 31, 2025, Wipro reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 3,119 crore, down 4 percent quarter-on-quarter and 7 percent year-on-year. IT services revenue stood at Rs 23,378 crore, missing Street estimates but rising 3.3 percent sequentially. Operating performance was mixed, with the company highlighting margin discipline and strong cash generation. However, at the heart of investor concern seems to be Wipro’s guidance for the March quarter, which came in below Street expectations, even as the company reported sequential revenue growth and maintained margins. Wipro guided for IT services revenue of $2.635 billion to $2.688 billion for the March quarter. This implies sequential growth of 0 percent to 2 percent in constant currency terms. Post-results brokerage commentary points to a clear divide. While some analysts see value support and operational discipline, others argue that weak deal momentum and execution risks justify caution -- views that appear to be driving Monday’s sell-off. Nomura: Buy, but flags guidance disappointment Nomura reiterated a Buy rating on Wipro with a target price of Rs 290 per share, arguing that Q3 operational performance was ahead of expectations. The brokerage acknowledged that Q4 guidance was weaker than anticipated, but noted that deal wins remained steady and margin discipline was intact. While Nomura cut its EPS estimates for FY27–FY28, it believes valuation comfort and dividend yield provide downside support to the stock. Jefferies: Underperform on growth and margin risks Jefferies struck a more cautious tone, maintaining an Underperform rating with a target price of Rs 220 per share. The brokerage said Q3 adjusted results were largely in line with expectations, but flagged weak deal bookings and delays in ramping new contracts as key risks to growth guidance. Jefferies also warned that margins could come under pressure from deal ramp-ups and acquisitions, and said low EPS CAGR and limited dividend appeal make the stock’s risk-reward unattractive.

The stock has gained 13.7 percent over the past one year, outperforming the benchmark Nifty 50, which has returned less than 11 percent over the same period. Over the weekend, HDFC Bank reported an 11.5 percent year-on-year rise in standalone net profit to Rs 18,650 crore for the December quarter, supported by steady core earnings, margin expansion and lower credit costs. Net interest income grew 6.4 percent, while asset quality remained stable, with gross NPAs unchanged sequentially at 1.24 percent. Brokerage reactions to the results were largely constructive. CLSA and Bernstein reiterated Outperform ratings with target prices of Rs 1,200 per share, citing a modest earnings beat, improving margins and disciplined cost control. Jefferies maintained a Buy call with a higher target price of Rs 1,240, while Kotak Institutional Equities retained an Add rating with a target of Rs 1,050. While analysts broadly praised the bank’s margin improvement and consistent earnings delivery, several brokerages flagged moderating deposit growth as the key near-term monitor, noting that a pickup in deposits would be important for reducing the loan-to-deposit ratio and supporting further upside in the stock.

ICICI Bank reported a 4 percent year-on-year decline in standalone net profit to Rs 11,318 crore in Q3 FY26, as higher one-off provisions weighed on earnings. Net interest income rose 7.7 percent year-on-year, supported by stable margins of 4.3 percent, while loan growth remained healthy, led by the corporate segment. Asset quality improved during the quarter, with the gross NPA ratio easing to 1.53 percent, though elevated provisions tempered overall profitability. Ahead of the quarterly results, ICICI Bank share price fell 0.4 percent on Friday to end at Rs 1,413 on NSE. The stock has gained over 15 percent in the last one year, outperforming benchmark Nifty 50, which has returned less than 11 percent during the same period. ICICI Bank stock call: Brokerages bullish on growth Brokerages also pointed to loan growth led by the corporate and mortgage segments, improving deposit traction with a stable CASA ratio. CLSA reiterated its Outperform rating on ICICI Bank with a target price of Rs 1,700 per share, implying an upside of over 20 percent. CLSA said the Q3 profit before tax missed estimates by about 7 percent due to a one-time provision. Excluding this impact, the brokerage said the bank’s adjusted performance was largely in line with expectations. CLSA highlighted 4 percent quarter-on-quarter and 12 percent year-on-year loan growth, led by the corporate segment, while noting that margins remained stable at 4.3 percent. Deposit growth improved to 9 percent year-on-year, with the CASA ratio holding steady, and asset quality trends remained strong with improved slippage ratios. Also read | HDFC Bank stock outlook: Brokerages bullish after Q3 profit beat Jefferies maintained its Buy rating and raised its target price to Rs 1,730 per share, attributing the Q3 earnings miss to higher agricultural provisions and the impact of labour law-related costs. The brokerage said loan growth improved to 12 percent, driven by corporate and mortgage loans,  while unsecured retail lending remained soft. Asset quality stayed stable, Jefferies said, adding that the two-year extension granted to CEO Sandeep Bakhshi until October 2028 provides continuity and clarity at the top. Bernstein, which has a more cautious stance, retained its Market Perform rating with a target price of Rs 1,550 per share. The brokerage acknowledged that the CEO’s re-appointment meaningfully reduces an overhang on the stock; but it flagged a weaker quarterly performance. Bernstein said loan and deposit growth trailed broader system trends, margins were flat quarter-on-quarter compared with improvements seen at peers, and a one-time spike in credit costs hurt profitability. It also noted that earnings per share declined on a year-on-year basis. Kotak Institutional Equities reiterated its Add rating and raised its target price to Rs 1,800 per share, noting that Q3 FY26 earnings declined around 4 percent year-on-year due to higher one-off provisions. Kotak said the extension of the CEO’s tenure until October 2028 removes uncertainty, while loan growth of about 10 percent year-on-year and deposit growth of around 8 percent year-on-year point to steady underlying momentum. The brokerage described operating profit growth as muted at about 3 percent year-on-year but said asset quality remained stable and the bank’s strong liability franchise continues to support its long-term outlook.

"HDFC Bank stock outlook: Brokerages bullish after Q3 profit beat, flag deposit growth as key monitor",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/hdfc-bank-stock-outlook-brokerages-bullish-after-q3-profit-beat-flag-deposit-growth-as-key-monitor-13778041.html,"Brokerages largely retained their bullish stance on HDFC Bank stock after its Q3 FY26 results, citing a modest earnings beat, improving margins and controlled costs, while continuing to flag deposit growth as the key near-term concern for the lender. Over the weekend, HDFC Bank reported an 11.5 percent year-on-year rise in standalone net profit to Rs 18,650 crore in Q3 FY26, aided by steady core earnings, margin expansion and lower credit costs. Net interest income grew 6.4 percent, while asset quality remained stable, with gross NPAs unchanged sequentially at 1.24 percent. Ahead of the quarterly results, HDFC Bank shares had risen 0.55 percent on Friday to end at Rs 930.55 on the NSE. The stock has gained 13.7 percent in the last one year, outperforming benchmark Nifty 50, which has returned less than 11 percent during the same period. HDFC Bank stock call: Brokerages say 'buy' Brokerages stayed constructive on the stock even as they flagged moderating deposit growth and the need for stronger mobilisation to support a re-rating. CLSA reiterated its Outperform rating on HDFC Bank stock with a target price of Rs 1,200 per share, implying an upside of about 29 percent. The brokerage noted that the bank’s Q3 FY26 profit before tax was 5 percent ahead of estimates, aided by in-line pre-provision operating profit and lower-than-expected credit costs. Core operating profit came in 2 percent above expectations, driven by better net interest margins and cost control. CLSA highlighted an 8 basis point sequential expansion in margins, supported by lower deposit costs and the benefit of the CRR cut, even as loan growth at 2.7 percent quarter-on-quarter lagged its estimate. Deposit growth moderated to 12 percent year-on-year due to curtailment of wholesale deposits, though average CASA growth improved during the quarter. Also read | ICICI Bank stock outlook: Brokerages largely positive even after Q3 profit miss; CEO extension a key relief Bernstein also maintained an Outperform rating with a Rs 1,200 target, pointing to consistent earnings delivery. The brokerage noted that Q3 earnings per share growth improved to 11 percent year-on-year from 10 percent in the previous quarter, supported by steady net interest income, marginal increase in the loan-to-deposit ratio, release of provision buffers, cost discipline and healthy fee income. Return on assets remained stable, it said. Jefferies reiterated its Buy call and raised a slightly higher target price of Rs 1,240 per share, after the bank reported profit ahead of estimates. While core profit was largely in line after adjusting for provision releases and one-offs, Jefferies said deposit growth of around 12 percent remains a concern. The brokerage noted management’s clarification that the bank exited costlier deposits to improve margins, adding that a pickup in deposit growth would be critical for reducing the loan-to-deposit ratio and supporting a re-rating of the stock. Asset quality remained stable, it added. Kotak Institutional Equities maintained an Add rating with a target price of Rs 1,050 per share, highlighting a 12 percent year-on-year growth in Q3 FY26 earnings. Operating profit rose 8 percent, while provisions declined 10 percent year-on-year. Loan growth stood at 12 percent, and net interest margins improved 10 basis points sequentially to 3.3 percent. Kotak said the bank’s guidance for above-industry growth in FY27 reflects the need for stronger deposit mobilisation going ahead.

Additionally, the SuperTrend parameter indicates a bullish outlook, and the recent correction provides an opportunity to reiterate bullish positions from a short- to medium-term perspective. Hence, we recommend buying the stock around Rs 102–100. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 118, Rs 122 Stop-Loss: Rs 92 Inox Green Energy Services | CMP: Rs 189.38  Inox Green Energy has undergone a corrective phase of nearly 30 percent from its lifetime high post the formation of an ‘Inverted H&S’ on daily charts, and with the recent plunge, the counter has retested the neckline. Simultaneously, there has been a ‘bullish divergence’ between the RSI and price action, that too at the neckline and the 200 DSMA, suggesting the initiation of a counter-trend in the stock price in the near period. Hence, we recommend buying the stock around Rs 185–180. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 220, Rs 240 Stop-Loss: Rs 160 Mishra Dhatu Nigam | CMP: Rs 357.85  Mishra Dhatu Nigam has demonstrated substantial consolidation near its significant EMAs in the last couple of weeks. Additionally, the counter is in a ‘symmetrical triangle’ formation on the broader timeframe and witnessed a volume spurt near the lower band, which has pushed the counter to a higher zone in the recent period. Also, the technical indicators are strongly aligned with the price momentum, indicating a bullish outlook for the near term. Hence, we recommend buying the stock around Rs 350. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 385, Rs 400 Stop-Loss: Rs 320 Anshul Jain, Head of Research at Lakshmishree Investments Tech Mahindra | CMP: Rs 1,670.5  Backed by strong earnings, Tech Mahindra has broken out of a 46-week bullish VCP (volatility contraction pattern) structure near Rs 1,633, signaling a clear shift in trend strength. The stock closed right at the key resistance of Rs 1,684, highlighting this level as the immediate trigger zone. Volume expansion through the base and breakout confirms institutional participation, while rising daily and weekly moving averages underline improving momentum alignment. A sustained move above Rs 1,684 would unlock a sharper upmove toward the prior all-time high of Rs 1,756.85, which now looks more like a minor pause than a ceiling. Beyond that, the broader VCP pattern projects an extended upside toward the Rs 1,900 zone. Risk–reward remains favourable as long as the price holds above the breakout base, with pullbacks likely to be shallow and absorbed. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,900 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,600 HCL Technologies | CMP: Rs 1,698  HCL Technologies has confirmed a decisive breakout from a 29-week bullish cup-and-handle pattern near Rs 1,695, marking a clear trend acceleration. The standout feature is the right side of the pattern forming a tight flag, adding momentum fuel for bulls. The handle also represented the first controlled pullback into rising 10-, 20-, and 50-week moving averages, which are now acting as a strong launchpad. Breakout volumes have expanded sharply, signaling institutional participation and conviction. The price structure across timeframes remains constructive, with risk–reward favourably skewed higher. As long as the stock holds above the breakout zone, follow-through momentum can drive an initial move toward the Rs 1,825–1,938 band. Failure to sustain above the moving average cluster would be the key invalidation. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,825, Rs 1,938 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,640 Force Motors | CMP: Rs 20,565  Force Motors has delivered a clean breakout from a 20-week rectangle formation near Rs 20,500, signaling a resumption of its primary uptrend. The consolidation was constructive, with the price resting firmly on rising 10-, 20-, and 50-week moving averages, which have now aligned to form a strong launchpad. The breakout structure reflects absorption rather than distribution, keeping trend strength intact across timeframes. Volume behaviour remains supportive, indicating steady participation rather than speculative excess. As long as the stock sustains above the breakout zone, momentum is likely to extend further. The immediate upside projection points toward the Rs 22,500 zone, where partial resistance may emerge. Risk–reward remains favourable while the price holds above the rectangle base, with any pullback toward rising averages expected to attract demand rather than trigger supply. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 22,500 Stop-Loss: Rs 19,500"
Broader indices underperform but these 27 small-cap stocks gain up to 62%,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/broader-indices-underperform-but-these-27-small-cap-stocks-gain-up-to-62-13776730.html,"Broader indices lagged the benchmarks during the week, with mid- and small-cap indices extending losses for a second straight week, declining up to 0.4 percent.

""The Indian equity markets experienced a range-bound trading week, with the benchmark index oscillating within the confines of its 50 and 100-day EMAs. Despite heightened intraday volatility and sharp swings in both directions, the Nifty50 concluded the truncated week on a subdued note, settling a tad below the 25700 mark and registering a marginal weekly gain of 0.04%,"" said Osho Krishan, Chief Manager -Technical and Derivative research at Angel One. ""The shortened trading week was eventful, influenced by a mix of global and domestic developments. Persistent concerns around trade tariffs and escalating geopolitical tensions continued to weigh on investor sentiment, fostering a cautious market environment. At the same time, ongoing quarterly earnings announcements and key macroeconomic data provided selective opportunities across sectors. Despite these headwinds, the market exhibited notable resilience. The Nifty50 index managed to contain downside risks, holding near the key EMA on the daily charts, underscoring the underlying strength and consolidation phase in the broader market structure."" ""Going forward, it remains crucial to closely monitor global developments, particularly those related to trade tariffs and geopolitical tensions, as these factors are likely to act as significant catalysts in shaping near-term market trends. Additionally, several heavyweight constituents of the Nifty are scheduled to announce their earnings over the weekend, the impact of which is expected to be reflected in market action in the forthcoming sessions. In this backdrop, a prudent and disciplined approach is recommended, with market participants aligning their strategies around the aforementioned technical levels,"" he added. The BSE Small-cap index declined nearly 0.5 percent during the week.

Where is Nifty50 headed? Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities Nifty on the weekly chart formed a small bull candle with upper and lower shadow. Technically, this market action signal formation of high wave type candle pattern after a sharp weakness of previous week. This reflects ongoing volatility in the market. The underlying trend of Nifty remains choppy. A sustainable move above 25900 could open further upside for the next week. However, a slide below the support of 25500 could trigger more downside in the market ahead. Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking The ongoing tussle around the medium-term moving average, the 100 DEMA near the 25,600 zone, is keeping participants cautious. The market is likely to take cues from the earnings announcements of key heavyweights such as Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank in early trade on Monday, which could determine the next directional move. Until then, participants are advised to maintain a selective, stock-specific approach, focusing on sectors showing relative strength such as IT, financials and metals, while adhering to disciplined risk management in the prevailing volatile environment. Amol Athawale, VP Technical Research, Kotak Securities We are of the view that the current market formation is volatile and non-directional, and the short-term activity indicating a non-directional trend is likely to continue in the near future. On the downside, 25,500/83000 and 25,400/82700 would act as key support zones, while the daily SMA (Simple Moving Average) at 25,950/84600 and the 20-day SMA at 26,000/84800 would be crucial resistance levels for the bulls. For Bank Nifty, as long as it is trading above the 20-day SMA at 59,500, the uptrend is likely to continue. On the higher side, it could move up to 60,500. Further upside potential may lift the index up to 60,800. Conversely, if it falls below the 20-day SMA at 59,500, the uptrend would become vulnerable.
