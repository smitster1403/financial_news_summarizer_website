This will also offer access to world-class infrastructure, as BeLink Solutions has six fully automated production lines and advanced testing equipment. The deal enhances revenue visibility for Hind Rectifiers as BeLink is expected to generate Euro 13 million in revenue for 2025, with an additional Euro 10 million in pending orders for 2026. Global Footprint Hind Rectifiers has exported transformer and power electronics converter to Germany in Q1FY26, which will also be exported to the US for the first time. ""...we never got an opportunity to export into Europe and US and that marks a big sort of entry into that geography for Railways. So we are pursuing with them, and we have moreopportunities and more inquiries,"" said Suramya Nevatia during the June quarter earnings call. ""...we are building new products, which will have more export potential and that will come into play. So before we have the products ready, we are trying to build our sales channel and sales pipeline globally,"" Nevatia added."

On the technical front, analysts at SAMCO Securities said the 55,300–55,400 zone has emerged as a strong demand area. ""With resistance-turned-support dynamics in play, the 55,300 level remains dependable support. As long as this base holds, a buy-on-dips strategy is favourable,"" they noted. Amruta Shinde, Technical & Derivative Analyst at Choice Equity Broking, said key support is seen at 55,600, with a break below this level likely to drag the index toward 55,500 and 55,300.

Buy Alkem Laboratories; target of Rs 6400: ICICI Securities,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-alkem-laboratories-target-of-rs-6400-icici-securities-13560121.html,"ICICI Securities research report on Alkem Laboratories Alkem Laboratories’ CEO, Dr. Vikas Gupta, is targeting double-digit revenue growth in the medium term, driven by strong hold in India (68% of sales), other international markets and new ventures. In India, it aims to grow 100-150bps faster than IPM as focused chronic therapies are growing at a faster pace with adequate growth supported by the acute portfolio. It acquired Bombay Ortho for INR 1.5bn in Apr’25 and entered into an in-licensing deal with Exactech for a foray in the fast-growing medtech space. Commercial operations at the new CDMO facility in the US will start in Q3FY26 and Alkem has a decent orderbook which could ensure swift pick-up and EBITDA breakeven in 12-18 months. We believe optimisation of RM cost and operating leverage may drive 100bps expansion in margins every year (25% margin targeted in medium term) while losses of new ventures may be curbed from H2FY27, helping it post ~200bps improvement in margins over FY25-28E. Outlook Transitory impact of opex of new ventures (annual opex of INR 2.4-3bn) and higher tax rate (35% from FY27) are already priced in, making the valuations attractive. Retain BUY with a revised TP of INR 6,400 (23x FY27E EV/EBITDA).

Buy Prince Pipes and Fittings; target of Rs 440: Motilal Oswal,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-prince-pipes-and-fittings-target-of-rs-440-motilal-oswal-2-13560066.html,"Motilal Oswal's research report on Prince Pipes and Fittings Prince Pipes and Fittings (PRINCPIP) hosted an analyst meet on 18th Sep’25, where it highlighted the current demand-supply and pricing scenarios in the PVC pipes industry. The PVC pipes market remains under pressure due to volatile PVC prices and a weak demand environment. In addition, the delay in the implementation of anti-dumping duty (ADD) has created uncertainty within channel partners, putting pressure on the PVC prices market domestically. Given that 2Q is seasonally weak, the company anticipates a healthy demand outlook in 2HFY26, thereby maintaining its guidance for FY26. Outlook We expect ~12% volume CAGR over FY25-28 with margin expansion, as operating leverage and product mix benefits play out. Structural demand drivers such as government housing schemes, plumbing upgrades, and GST rationalization should provide tailwinds in 2HFY26 and beyond. We maintain BUY with a TP of INR440 (based on 30x FY27E EPS).

JSW Energy takes over GE Power’s boiler business in share swap deal,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/jsw-energy-takes-over-ge-power-s-boiler-business-in-share-swap-deal-13559748.html,"JSW Energy, the holding company of JSW Group's power business, will acquire the boiler manufacturing unit of GE Power India (GEPIL) through a strategic demerger, in order to enhance its thermal power business, the company said in an exchange filing, sending the shares modestly higher in a weak market on September 19. The deal will be a share-swap arrangement that will see GEPIL demerge its boiler manufacturing facility in Durgapur to JSW Energy, and the JSW entity will issue 10 equity shares for every 139 shares held by GEPIL shareholders. The appointed date for the scheme of demerger is July 1, 2025. JSW-GEPIL Deal Rationale The demerger scheme will help JSW Energy in 'vertical integration' through a dedicated boiler manufacturing facility, reducing dependency on third-party suppliers, and leading to economies of scale, the company said. The deal will lead to ""cost efficiencies, and improving control over critical component requirements of thermal power asset enabling increased production capacity...,"" said JSW Energy. The move supports future thermal projects of JSW Energy and aligns with the longer term vision of expanding into the energy portfolio, creating value for shareholders, JSW Energy added. Brokerages Bullish Jefferies has issued a Buy call on JSW Energy and said that the management is anticipating 4.4-4.9 GW power capacity addition in FY26 as against the estimate of 3.1 GW. Morgan Stanley has a Overweight call on JSW Energy wit a target of Rs 659/share. Shares of JSW Energy are higher by 1.5 percent in early trade on September 19. Tidong Power Deal In a separate development, JSW Neo Energy, a wholly owned subsidiary of JSW Energy, is acquiring Tidong Power Generation from Statkraft Holding with a 150 MW under construction hydro-power project, helping the company achieve renewable capacity growth target of 30 GW by FY30. The acquisition is expected to be completed by January 15, 2026. The deal is being agreed upon at an enterprise value of Rs 1,728 crore. ""This acquisition further strengthens our position as the largest private hydro power player in India and reinforces ourcommitment to support India’s power sector. We are confident of completing the construction in a timely manner,"" Sharad Mahendra, Joint Managing Director and CEO of JSW Energy said. This will be the fourth hydro asset for JSW Energy and a 'significant addition' to its hydel portfolio in Himachal Pradesh, the company added. Domestic Power Capacity India’s total installed power capacity has reached 485 GW, with 19.9 GW added in Q1FY26 alone. This addition has taken India's clean energy capacity to 50%, achieving its Paris Agreement target five years ahead of schedule, with non-fossil fuel capacity of 243 GW. The year FY25 saw an emerging trend of state distribution companies increasingly bidding for thermal power procurement, which JSW Energy said is expected to continue in FY26."

Adani Group stocks higher by up to 10% as investors welcome Sebi clean chit,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/adani-enterprises-adani-power-other-group-stocks-in-focus-as-it-gets-sebi-s-clean-chit-in-hindenburg-case-13559233.html,"Shares of Adani Group companies including Adani Enterprises, Adani Power, Adani Green Energy, Adani Total Gas surged up to 10 percent on September 19 after regulatory Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) gave the conglomerate and its founder, Gautam Adani, a clean chit in the stock manipulation case triggered by US-based short seller Hindenburg Research. What Sebi said In two detailed orders, SEBI said its investigation found no evidence that the group routed funds through related parties to inflate share prices of its listed entities. Allegations of insider trading, market manipulation, and violations of public shareholding norms were deemed unsubstantiated after months of inquiry. Hindenburg Research, which has since shut down operations, released a report in January 2023 alleging that Adani Group used three firms: Adicorp Enterprises Pvt Ltd, Milestone Tradelinks Pvt Ltd, and Rehvar Infrastructure Pvt Ltd as conduits to channel funds into Adani Enterprises and Adani Power. The report had sparked a massive selloff, erasing more than $100 billion in market value at its lowest point. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog However, SEBI board member Kamlesh C Varshney clarified in the orders that transactions involving these three firms did not qualify as related-party dealings under the rules at that time, and hence did not breach disclosure requirements. “After a thorough investigation, SEBI has concluded there is no basis to hold the Adani entities or their executives liable or to impose penalties,” the regulator said. ALSO READ: SEBI disposes of proceedings against Adani Group firms, Gautam Adani; finds no merit in Hindenburg allegations The ruling provides significant relief to the ports-to-power conglomerate, which had been under the scanner for months amid regulatory scrutiny and market speculation. A Supreme Court-appointed expert committee had earlier arrived at a similar conclusion, noting no prima facie evidence of wrongdoing. Morgan Stanley initiates ""overweight"" call on Adani Power Global brokerage firm Morgan Stanley initiated ""overweight"" rating on Adani Power and shared target price of Rs 818, implying upside potential of 30 percent. Analysts said that the company is a strong example of a corporate turnaround in India. Most of the regulatory issues have been resolved and value accretive acquisitions have been completed. The brokerage firm believes that the company is set to deliver strong earnings growth from timely projects and new PPAs. Capacity and EBITDA forecast to rise 2.5x and 3x by FY33. Despite the overhang, Adani Group shares have delivered a mixed performance in 2025. So far this year, shares of Adani Enterprises, Adani Green Energy, and Adani Total Gas have declined by as much as 19 percent, while Adani Ports and Adani Power have gained up to 19 percent.

Asian stocks rise as global gauge hits new peak,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/asian-stocks-rise-as-global-gauge-hits-new-peak-13558776.html,"Asian stocks were on the cusp of an intraday record high after US and global equity benchmarks hit fresh peaks, as the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate cut bolstered sentiment. Stocks in Japan and Australia opened higher while South Korea was flat. The S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Russell 2000 small-cap index all closed together at fresh highs for the first time since November 2021. An MSCI index of global stocks also closed at a record in a sign of robust risk appetite. The yen was steady after Japan’s consumer inflation slowed abruptly, with the Bank of Japan’s rate decision due later on Friday. The upbeat mood in stocks reflected expectations for further rate cuts alongside an economy and jobs market that for now remain relatively resilient. Thursday’s data showed jobless claims dropped by the most in nearly four years, suggesting US companies are still holding onto workers. “The Fed is cutting interest rates during a time when stocks are at record highs and the economy is still growing,” said Robert Schein at Blanke Schein Wealth Management. “This dynamic is bullish for stocks.” Worries have been mounting for weeks that the S&P 500’s push to record after record risks becoming a bubble, with the index’s swollen valuation cited most often as a cause for concern. Critics point to the tech sector’s outsize influence on this year’s gain, with just five stocks, all megacap tech firms, driving about half of the advance. But a closer look shows tech giants have largely justified their elevated valuations with profit growth. “Investors have happily bought every dip, largely thanks to AI-driven enthusiasm and consistently strong results from big tech,” said Fawad Razaqzada at City Index and Forex.com. “The concern is that if tech momentum cools, the rest of the market may struggle to justify current valuations.” That leaves the rally vulnerable if investor confidence wavers, putting the S&P 500 forecast on a more cautious stance, he noted. “Our base case remains that the US economy will remain resilient and that it is unlikely to spiral into a recession,” said David Lefkowitz at UBS Global Wealth Management. “We therefore believe stocks are poised for further gains.” On the BOJ, economists polled by Bloomberg anticipate the central bank will leave its target interest rate unchanged at 0.5%. BOJ watchers will be looking for clues as to the likelihood of a move next month or in December."
"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Kotak Mahindra Bank, Aadhar Housing, Kansai Nerolac, Kfin Tech, Mankind Pharma, Zydus Life, and others on September 19?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-kotak-mahindra-bank-aadhar-housing-kansai-nerolac-kfin-tech-mankind-pharma-zydus-life-and-others-on-september-19-13558732.html,"Equity benchmarks extended their winning streak on September 18, with the Nifty closing above 25,400 for the first time since July 9, but the market breadth was slightly weak. About 1,436 shares saw selling pressure compared to 1,340 rising shares on the NSE. The market may see some consolidation, but overall, the mood remains bullish. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Jay Mehta, Technical Research at JM Financial Services Amara Raja Energy & Mobility | CMP: Rs 1,031  Amara Raja Energy & Mobility is displaying positive price action. The stock recently broke out of a descending channel with a significant increase in volume. This upward momentum is backed by an upward-sloping EMA and a bullish crossover between short- and medium-term EMAs. The convergence of EMAs near Rs 1,000 has established a strong support base. The stock has also reclaimed its position above the 200 EMA and is consolidating around that level. A decisive move above Rs 1,060 would likely fuel a further rally. Both the RSI and MACD are in bullish territory. A key positive sign is the high volume on green candles and very low volume on red candles, which indicates healthy accumulation. The stock shows high relative strength compared to the Nifty and Nifty 500. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,120, Rs 1,200 Stop-Loss: Rs 980 Aadhar Housing Finance | CMP: Rs 538.55  Aadhar Housing Finance is demonstrating significant bullish strength with a robust price structure. The stock broke out of a prolonged triangular consolidation at Rs 480 on July 15, rising to Rs 537.5. After a period of tighter consolidation, it has recently broken out again, reaching a near all-time high with strong volume, which confirms the move. The Bollinger Bands are widening at the breakout, suggesting increasing volatility. Momentum indicators support a continued bullish bias. The price is trading above all key EMAs, with the 20 and 50 EMAs providing strong support, aligning with the bullish candlesticks from September 12 and 16. The stock’s high relative strength compared to the Nifty and Nifty 500 further strengthens its positive outlook. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 580, Rs 600 Stop-Loss: Rs 485 Kansai Nerolac Paints | CMP: Rs 253.25  Kansai Nerolac, after trading in a descending channel since April 22, 2025, recently broke out on September 17. A significant volume build-up since August 11, accompanied by a high delivery percentage, suggests strong accumulation at lower levels. The price has reclaimed its position above the 200 EMA and is now trading above its short- and medium-term averages, which are converging near Rs 244 and will act as a strong base. Inside the channel, the stock formed a double bottom pattern with a positive divergence in the RSI, supporting the bullish trend. Both the RSI and MACD are in positive territory. The stock is also showing improved relative strength compared to the Nifty and Nifty 500. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 267, Rs 273 Stop-Loss: Rs 239 Hardik Matalia, Derivative Analyst at Choice Broking Kfin Technologies | CMP: Rs 1,144.8  Kfin Technologies has displayed strong bullish price action over the last three trading sessions. The stock has successfully broken out of a falling trendline, followed by a retest, which adds reliability to the breakout pattern. Notably, it has formed an inverse Head and Shoulders pattern and has decisively broken above the neckline — a classic bullish reversal structure. This breakout is accompanied by a significant increase in trading volume, indicating rising investor interest and strong market participation. Additionally, the stock has closed above key exponential moving averages — the 20, 50, and 200 EMA — providing a technical confluence that supports continued upward momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 58.93 and has shown a recent bullish crossover, confirming building positive momentum and healthy underlying strength. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,250 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,092 Bharat Petroleum Corporation | CMP: Rs 325.7  BPCL has successfully broken out of its trendline resistance zone and closed the previous session with positive momentum, which is supported by a notable surge in trading volume, indicating increased market participation and suggesting that the upward momentum may sustain in the near term. The stock has also managed to close above key exponential moving averages — the 20, 50, and 200 EMA — which further strengthens the bullish outlook and adds confluence to the ongoing upward move. Additionally, the stock has formed a double bottom pattern with strong support at the 200 EMA, further reinforcing the bullish sentiment. Furthermore, the RSI is currently at 59.66 and has shown a recent bullish crossover, confirming the positive momentum. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 360 Stop-Loss: Rs 310 Kotak Mahindra Bank | CMP: Rs 2,054.6  Kotak Mahindra Bank has exhibited strong bullish price action over the last three consecutive sessions. The stock is on the verge of an upside range breakout, supported by consistent volume buildup — a key indicator of strengthening buying interest. Notably, the stock has taken strong support near the Rs 1,920 level, evident from multiple wick rejections and sharp recovery from dips, which indicates strong demand at lower levels. Furthermore, it has successfully closed above critical exponential moving averages — the 20, 50, and 200 EMA — which creates a favourable technical setup and validates the underlying bullish sentiment. In addition to these bullish signals, the stock has managed to close above its previous swing high, reinforcing the continuation of the current uptrend. The RSI is currently positioned at 64.30, reflecting strong bullish momentum, with a recent crossover indicating further upside potential. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,230 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,960 Om Mehra, Technical Research Analyst at Samco Securities Mankind Pharma | CMP: Rs 2,638.3  Mankind Pharma formed a strong bullish candle on the daily chart, marking a breakout from a well-defined symmetrical triangle pattern. This move comes after a prolonged consolidation phase around the Rs 2,500–2,600 zone, indicating that the stock has gathered strength to resume its upward momentum. A bullish crossover of the short-term moving averages lends further confirmation to the breakout. The RSI has climbed to 62, suggesting the momentum is improving. The MACD has generated a bullish crossover with green histogram bars, further highlighting the positive momentum. Volume participation picked up in the latest session, adding confirmation to the breakout. The breakout from the triangular consolidation suggests a potential trend continuation on the upside. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,780 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,560 Zydus Lifesciences | CMP: Rs 1,047.85  Over the past several weeks, Zydus Lifesciences has been carving out a constructive base with a series of higher lows, pointing to steady accumulation. The consolidation phase has narrowed into a horizontal resistance band near the current level, and a decisive close above this mark would confirm a breakout and extend the ongoing uptrend. The stock continues to trade above all the key moving averages. The RSI has improved to 67, maintaining a steady northward slope and signaling strengthening momentum. The MACD has also held in positive territory, while volumes have shown noticeable improvement during recent attempts to push higher, lending weight to the breakout possibility. The stock is extending its momentum, supported by an inverse head and shoulders breakout. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,100 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,015 NMDC | CMP: Rs 76.73  NMDC has sustained above the breakout level of Rs 75.30, showing follow-through strength after a prolonged consolidation. The stock is now trading firmly above all its key moving averages, which highlights the broader stability of the uptrend and the strong base formation underway. Momentum indicators continue to support this move. The RSI stands at 66 with a steady northward slope, while the MACD holds its positive crossover with supportive histogram bars, both reflecting ongoing strength. The rise in trading volume during the recent leg of the rally further validates the breakout. The sectoral momentum is evident, with the metal index advancing more than 8% in a month, lending additional confirmation to NMDC’s strength.

Also read: Hindenburg case: Sebi dismisses allegations against Gautam Adani and group companies Sebi had investigated trades executed between January 1, 2022, and December 8, 2023, to determine whether client orders were front-run. Following the probe, the regulator issued a show cause notice to Motilal Oswal on February 20, 2025, alleging that the broker failed to exercise due skill and care by not keeping evidence of client order instructions, and instead attempted to create supporting documents after orders were executed. The order stated, “a show cause notice (SCN) dated February 20, 2025 was issued to the Applicant, wherein it was alleged that the Applicant failed to exercise due skill and care of its conduct as a registered stock broker by not keeping evidence of the order instructions of the client and by trying to create the supporting documents at a later date i.e. post execution of the client’s orders”. Pending the proceedings, Motilal Oswal applied for a settlement without admitting or denying the findings. The settlement application, filed in March 2025, was considered by Sebi’s Internal Committee, which recommended a settlement amount of Rs 34.85 lakh. The High-Powered Advisory Committee (HPAC) later endorsed the revised settlement terms. On September 5, 2025, panel of Sebi’s Whole Time Members approved the settlement. After the order, Motilal Oswal Financial in a statement clarified that, Sebi settlement order announced today relates to involvement and non-maintenance of records by one of our authorised partners (AP)- Om Securities.

Dr. Agarwal’s says merger valuation structured through fair and transparent process,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/dr-agarwal-s-says-merger-valuation-structured-through-fair-and-transparent-process-13558119.html,"Dr. Agarwal’s Eye Hospital Ltd (AEHL) says its proposed merger with holding company Dr. Agarwal’s Health Care Ltd (AHCL) has been structured through a transparent process backed by independent evaluations. The move, aimed at creating a single listed entity, has drawn questions from some investors after AEHL’s stock fell 18% post-announcement. AEHL stock gained 0.58% to close at Rs. 4,680.35 on BSE on Thursday. AHCL stock rose 0.94% to end at Rs 443.70 on Thursday.Below are the excerpts of company's response to Moneycontrol questions. Could you walk us through the structure of the proposed merger?We’ve announced the merger of AEHL with AHCL to create a single listed entity. AHCL will issue shares to AEHL’s minority shareholders, while its existing stake in AEHL will be cancelled. Additionally, AEHL’s board has approved a Rs 70 crore preferential allotment to AHCL to fund its flagship Chennai facility. This infusion is independent of the merger and will be completed beforehand. What’s the strategic rationale behind this move?The merger simplifies our corporate structure, enhances operational and financial efficiency, and accelerates growth. AEHL shareholders gain access to AHCL’s pan-India network, a larger clinical talent pool, and a company with higher market capitalisation. For AHCL shareholders, it means streamlined governance and integrated operations. How is swap ratio determined?The swap ratio—23 AHCL shares (Re 1 face value) for every 2 AEHL shares (Rs 10 face value)—was based on independent valuations by PwC and Bansi Mehta & Co., using globally accepted methods and market price trends. Kotak Mahindra Capital and Motilal Oswal provided fairness opinions. The ratio implies a 15% premium over the one-month average price prior to the announcement. Can you elaborate on AEHL’s preferential issue and the need for additional capital? Would this preferential issue have any impact on the merger?To support growth for the subsidiary company, the Board of AEHL has also approved a preferential issue aggregating approximately Rs 70 crore, comprising 1,32,827 equity shares at an issue price of Rs 5,270 per share , aligned with the merger pricing. This capital infusion will further strengthen AEHL’s balance sheet and ensure a smooth transition. The preferential allotment is being undertaken for funding the construction of our flagship facility in Chennai. Since the capex requirement is immediate, we are simultaneously proceeding with the preferential allotment along with the Merger. The primary infusion will be completed ahead of the merger completion. What’s the expected timeline and post-merger shareholding?The merger should close in 12–14 months, subject to approvals. Post-merger, AEHL’s public shareholders will hold 4.6%, AHCL promoters 30.9%, and AHCL’s public shareholders 64.5%. How does this align with AHCL’s IPO promise?When AHCL listed earlier this year, we committed to consolidating operations within three years. This merger delivers on that promise and positions us for long-term growth with a simplified governance framework."
BofA on telecom: Brokerage expects two rounds of industry-wide tariff hikes,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/bofa-on-telecom-brokerage-expects-two-rounds-of-industry-wide-tariff-hikes-13557823.html,"Bank of America Securities in its latest note said that it expects Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio to benefit from the calm competitive environment, reducing capex-to-sales ratio and improving cash-flows. The firm reiterated 'Buy' rating on both the stocks. The brokerage however maintained its 'Underperform' rating on the shares of debt-ridden telecom company Vodafone Idea and Indus Towers, due to their unfavourable risk-reward ratio. It noted that Vodafone Idea continues to lose market share, making its fundamentals weak even with prospective relief. BofA Securities said that a near-term bounce in stocks cannot be ruled out if government provides any dues relief to the companies. It expects two rounds of industry-wide tariff hikes, following which average revenue per user (ARPU) will likely move in line with inflation. Early investment in network capacity, aggressive pricing, adoption of emerging technologies over the next five years will likely determine which telecom companies will lead the 2030 generative AI landscape, the international brokerage added. Bharti Airtel shares closed marginally higher in the green at Rs 1,480.75 apiece. Earlier during the day, the stock hit an intraday high of Rs 1,488.50 apiece.

Click to View More Outlook for September 19 Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets traded volatile on Thursday but managed to maintain the positive tone, continuing its prevailing trend. After a flat start, the Nifty index oscillated within a limited range in the first half however volatility in heavyweights in the latter half triggered sharp swings. Eventually, it closed near the day’s high at 25,423.60, up 0.37%. Sectoral trends remained mixed, with pharma, IT and financials edged higher while energy and realty ended on a muted note. The broader markets outperformed once again, with both midcap and smallcap indices rising nearly 0.5% each, reflecting strong participation across segments. The market’s upward momentum was underpinned primarily by the US Federal Reserve’s rate cut of 25 basis points, which boosted risk sentiment globally. Besides, the sentiment stayed constructive, supported by sustained domestic flows and rotational buying in key sectors. On the index front, we are now on the verge of testing the target zone 25,500 zone in Nifty, which could prompt some profit taking or consolidation in the index ahead. However, the favorable sentiment across the key sectors would keep the tone positive. We thus recommend focusing more on stock-specific opportunities now, preferring stocks where risk to reward is favorable. Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities The market rally continues, with the Nifty ending 93 points higher, while the Sensex was up by 320 points. Among sectors, Pharma and Healthcare indices gained over 1 percent, whereas intraday profit booking was seen in selective Defence stocks. Technically, after a gap-up open, the market witnessed some selling pressure at higher levels. However, the short-term outlook remains positive. For day traders, the higher bottom support is placed near 25,300/82700. We are of the view that as long as the market trades above this level, the bullish sentiment is likely to continue. On the higher side, 25,500/83300 would act as an immediate resistance zone for the bulls. A successful breakout above 25,500/83300 could push the market up to 25,600–25,625/83500-83600. On the flip side, if the market falls below 25,300/82700, the uptrend would become vulnerable. Below this level, traders may prefer to exit their long positions. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities Nifty remained volatile after a gap-up start, driven by a dovish Fed announcement. The short-term trend is likely to stay positive as the index is comfortably trading above its critical moving average. The daily RSI is in a bullish crossover and rising above the previous swing high, indicating strengthening momentum. In the near term, support is placed at 25,300 and 25,150. On the other hand, crucial resistance is seen at 25,500. A decisive move above this level could trigger a rally towards 26,000. Overall, a buy-on-dips strategy remains favorable in the current market scenario.

"MC Exclusive | Sunil Singhania: New-age firms face risk as competition chases market cap, not profits",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/mc-exclusive-sunil-singhania-new-age-firms-face-risk-as-competition-chases-market-cap-not-profits-13557516.html,"India’s highly valued firms may face a fresh set of risks as competition shifts from chasing profit pools to chasing market capitalisation, according to Sunil Singhania, founder of Abakkus Asset Manager. “Earlier competition used to come up to take a share of the profit,” he said on the Wealth Formula Podcast with N Mahalakshmi. “Now competition is coming up to take a share of the market cap, which is more dangerous. In these businesses the top two will take 80–90 percent market share.” Citing examples like Zomato, Nykaa and Paytm, Singhania said it remains difficult for valuation-focused investors like him to take large exposure in such high-multiple stocks. While he acknowledged their phenomenal growth rates, improving unit economics and a shift towards profitability, he noted that portfolios would not have 30–40% weight in such names. “On a forward basis, if you just take it to FY28 or FY29, many of these companies start to look like 30–40x PE as the growth could be 100%. So somewhere you’ll have to say India is not only traditional companies, it’s also 5–7% allocation to these new-age ones,” he said. Still, he flagged intense competition as a key risk. “If Zomato is at ₹3 lakh crore and Swiggy only at ₹2 lakh crore, another player might come up saying we can make $1–2 billion. That’s dangerous for both existing companies and investors,” he said. He drew parallels with the paints industry, where the aggregate profit pool is just ₹6,000–7,000 crore. Despite this, multiple players have entered, lured by the market leader’s high valuation. “The motivation is the market cap because profit pool is not very large,” Singhania said. He added that even consumer companies must adapt, as younger consumers are open to experimentation across personal care, apparel, and footwear. “The existing market leader will have to work that much harder to protect their turf,” he said."

IHCL shares sharply rose 1 percent after trading in the red earlier during the day. Who are the prospective buyers? Prominent Saudi family, the Khashoggis, and the Dorchester Collection, a luxury hotel company owned by the sultanate of Brunei, have reached the final stages of discussions to purchase the iconic luxury hotel in New York for approximately $2 billion, New York Times reported citing sources. The Khashoggis will provide some of the funding, while Dorchester Collection will mostly manage the building after an extensive renovation, the report added. The iconic Pierre in New York was inaugurated in 1930, and was reintroduced in 2007 as the Taj flagship in the USA. The luxury hotel is located in the Central Park. According to the NYT report, billionaire and currently the US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick in 2023 pushed for the plan to hire his own real estate firm Newmark Group for advice on how to revamp the property which was seeing some damage over time. The board, as advised by Newmark, has now reached the final stages of talk to sell Piere for roughly $2 billion, the report added. 'Residents may be forced to move out' If the sale does take place, Pierre's permanent residents like former Disney chief Michael Eisner, fashion designer Tory Burch and Shari Redstone, who recently sold her company Paramount, may be forced to move out, the report added. Lutnick also has a penthouse in the Pierre. After months of discussions, Newmark concluded that Taj was not willing to invest more money to address the growing problems of the building, according to communications by The Times, cited by NYT. Moneycontrol couldn't independently verify the reports. The shares of IHCL have gained nearly 2 percent in the past five days, but have fallen around 10 percent in 2025 so far.

Cohance Life shares tumble 6% as 3.4 crore shares exchange hands via block deal,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/cohance-life-shares-tumble-6-as-3-4-crore-shares-exchange-hands-via-block-deal-13556246.html,"Shares of Cohance Lifesciences came under sharp pressure on September 18, tumbling 6 percent to Rs 909 apiece after a large block deal hit the exchanges. Around 3.39 crore shares, translating to 8.9 percent equity worth Rs 3,073 crore, changed hands in early trade. While the identity of sellers was not confirmed, reports on CNBC-TV18 suggested that Jusmiral Holdings was looking to offload up to 8.9 percent stake in the company. The reported deal is also accompanied by a 210-day lock-up on further share sales. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog Despite the knee-jerk reaction, global brokerage Jefferies has an optimistic view on Cohance and the broader Indian CRDMO (Contract Research, Development, and Manufacturing Organization) sector. The brokerage recently initiated coverage with a “Buy” rating and a price target of Rs 1,150, citing structural tailwinds. “India’s CRDMO industry is transitioning from being a traditional chemical manufacturer to becoming a strategic partner for global innovators. This shift, driven by enhanced capabilities, geographic diversification, and the China+1 strategy, could deliver a high-teen revenue CAGR over the next decade,” Jefferies said. In Q1FY26, Cohance reported an adjusted net profit of Rs 62.9 crore, down 24.8 percent year-on-year from Rs 83.5 crore in Q1FY25. Revenue from operations, however, rose 12.5 percent YoY to Rs 549.3 crore, supported by growth across segments. Material margin improved 20.1 percent YoY to Rs 401.2 crore, with margin percentage expanding to 73 percent from 68.4 percent, aided by a favourable business mix and contributions from recent acquisitions.

"Infosys, LTIMindtree, Wipro, other IT stocks rise up to 3% after 25 bps Fed rate cut",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/infosys-ltimindtree-wipro-other-it-stocks-rise-up-to-3-after-25-bps-fed-rate-cut-13556193.html,"The shares of Indian IT companies jumped on September 18 after the US Federal Reserve cut its interest rate for the first time since December 2024. The sharp rise in the share prices pushed the Nifty IT index higher to emerge as the top sectoral gainer on the market today. The Nifty IT index rose 1.5 percent in the morning to 37,006, extending gains for the third consecutive session. US Fed cuts rates by 25 bps: The US Federal Reserve on September 17 slashed its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 4-4.25 percent, in line with analyst expectations. Notably, this marked the first rate cut announced by the American central bank since Donald Trump began his second term as the President of the United States. More rate cuts on the way? Policymakers hinted at two more quarter-point cuts this year (50 bps in total), plus one cut in 2026 and another in 2027. One official projected a whopping 125 bps of easing by December. In its statement, the US Fed said ""recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity moderated in the first half of the year. Job gains have slowed, and the unemployment rate has edged up but remains low. Inflation has moved up and remains somewhat elevated."" It added that ""downside risks to employment have risen"", prompting the shift in policy. 'A risk management cut' During the press conference, US Fed Chair Jerome Powell called the quarter-point rate cut a ""risk management cut"", highlighting that the labour market has softened and ""the recent pace of job creation appears to be running below the breakeven rate needed to hold the unemployment rate constant."" He added, ""The labour market is softening and we don’t need it to soften anymore (and) don't want it to."" Why IT stocks surge after Fed's rate cut: A rate cut in the US is expected to increase the discretionary spending limit, which in turn benefits IT companies which derive a significant portion of their revenue from the North American market. LTIMindtree shares jumped nearly 3 percent to trade at Rs 5,573 apiece. Infosys, Wipro and Mphasis shares surged nearly 2 percent each. Persistent Systems, HCL Tech, Coforge and Tech Mahindra shares gained more than 1 percent each. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) shares were up nearly 1 percent. What analysts say? ""The FED continues to face a delicate balancing act following a 0.25% rate cut at its latest meeting in September. Whilst the rate cut was expected, it is of more note to listen to what Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in the Press Conference afterwards, where he mentioned that policy decisions remain challenging, and the committee members are still split on further rate cuts, with 10 out of 19 policy makers seeing two or more rate cuts this year,"" said Ross Maxwell, Global Strategy Lead at VT Markets. ""Financial markets are likely to welcome the rate cut in the near term, as lower borrowing costs ease pressure on households and businesses. Equity markets may see short-term support, though bond yields could remain volatile as investors weigh growth concerns against inflation risks,"" he added.

PM Modi turns 75: Sensex rallied up to 245% under his leadership; what lies ahead?,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sensex-rallied-up-to-245-under-pm-modi-s-leadership-what-lies-ahead-13554288.html,"Indian capital markets have seen strong surge since Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power in 2014. Indian benchmark index Sensex rose up to 60,000 points since then, which implies gains to the tune of nearly 245 percent. Analysts now expect the Indian stock markets to rally further, under PM Modi's leadership. Sensex jumped 245% in 10 years: Prime Minister Narendra Modi took charge on May 26, 2014. Sensex was trading at around 25,000-level then. The benchmark index then rallied more than 60,000 points (around 245 percent) in around 10 years to nearly touch the 86,000-mark in September 2024. The index has now seen some correction, closing at 82,694 on September 17. Several analysts who spoke to Moneycontrol suggest that Sensex can rally sharply to hit the key 1,00,000-mark by the end of PM Modi's third term in 2029. What led to the sharp gains? According to Khushi Mistry, Research Analyst at Bonanza, Sensex and Nifty's massive gains since May 2014 have been driven by reforms-led FDI inflows, robust consumption growth, a banking sector reset, accelerated digital adoption, and strong corporate earnings, alongside global liquidity and a stable policy framework under the Modi government. Sensex hitting 1 lakh by the end of PM Modi’s third term is possible if current earnings growth (14–16% CAGR), government reforms, and capex cycle sustain, she said, adding that risks include global volatility and oil prices. ""Bullish estimates expect Sensex could hit the mark before 2029 if reforms stay on track, but any major shocks could delay this milestone,"" the analyst said. 'Sensex at 1 lakh is a very achievable target' Shravan Shetty, Managing Director at Primus Partners, said hitting 1 lakh mark in the next three years is a very achievable target. “Historically, markets have grown at 12-15% and with markets at 82K, it should reach the target. We believe that the India story is still being played out, and with lower growth expected globally, especially the USA, we should see higher FII participation helping markets grow,"" he said. Santosh Meena, Head of Research at Swastika Investmart, believes it is quite possible for the Sensex to reach the 1,00,000 mark by the end of Prime Minister Modi’s third term, as it is only about 20 percent away from current levels. 'Valuations have become more reasonable now' ""After a year of flat returns, valuations have become more reasonable, creating a comfortable entry point. On the domestic front, growth-supportive factors remain strong, with recent income tax cuts, interest rate reductions, and GST rationalization acting as key catalysts that can drive the next leg of market expansion,"" he added. Morgan Stanley in August had said that it sees Sensex hitting the key 1 lakh mark by June next year in bull case, citing a final trade deal with the US, more capex announcements, acceleration in loans,  uniform improvement in high frequency data and improving trade with China as the likely triggers. However, it had also suggested a bear case where Sensex could fall to 70,000 on the back of surging oil prices, slowing growth and more. 'Democratisation of India's capital markets under PM Modi's leadership' Extending wishes to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on his 75th birthday, NSE CEO Ashish Chauhan on September 17 noted how India's capital markets developed under PM Modi’s leadership over the years. ""Under his leadership, India has emerged as the world's fourth-largest economy and the fourth-largest capital market, with the equity market capitalisation of NSE-listed companies rising over 6 times-from about Rs 67 lakh crore in May 2014 to nearly Rs 460 lakh crore today,"" he said. Chauhan said the ""democratisation of capital markets"" reflects the rise of India's middle class, with nearly one in four households now investing in equities, which underscores the growing trust in India's economic future under PM Modi’s leadership.

Click to View More Outlook for September 18 Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets edged higher in a subdued session on Wednesday, reflecting a positive yet cautious undertone. After a firm start, the Nifty index traded in a narrow range throughout the day before settling at 25,330.25 level. Sectoral performance was mixed, with IT, banking, and auto emerging as the top gainers, while metals, FMCG, and pharma witnessed profit-taking. Meanwhile, the broader indices maintained their positive bias, with both midcap and small-cap indices closing in the green. Despite the range-bound move, underlying sentiment remains supported by optimism around policy reforms and robust domestic flows. However, persistent FII selling and caution ahead of the U.S. Fed policy outcome capped the momentum. On the index front, the Nifty is now inching towards the 25,500 mark, aided by renewed strength in banking and rotational buying across sectors. We recommend continuing with a “buy on dips” approach, with support placed around the 25,050–25,150 zone, while keeping position sizes moderate given the likelihood of higher volatility due to global events. Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities Today, the benchmark indices continued their positive momentum. The Nifty ended with a gain of 91 points, while the Sensex was up by 313 points. Among sectors, the PSU Bank Index outperformed, rallying over 2.60 percent, whereas consumer and selective Metal stocks registered intraday profit booking at higher levels. Technically, after a promising opening, the entire day witnessed range-bound activity. However, the short-term market outlook remains positive. We believe that 25,200/82500 and 25,150/82200 are key support zones for trend-following traders. As long as the market trades above these levels, the uptrend is likely to continue. On the higher side, the index could move up to 25,400-25,500/83000-83200. Conversely, below 25,150/82200, traders may consider exiting their long positions Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

This comes as analysts increasingly expect trade talks between India and US to resume, amid cooling tensions between the two countries. Gokaldas Exports shares surged nearly 7 percent to trade at nearly Rs 835 apiece. Welspun Living shares also rallied around 7 percent to trade at Rs 132.50 apiece. Pearl Global Industries and Arvind shares jumped around 4 percent each, while Indo Count Industries and K.P.R. Mill shares gained around 2 percent each. Raymond shares were up 1 percent. Cooling India-US trade tensions: Indo-US relations have seen some improvement in recent days with US President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreeing to resume trade talks. Brendan Lynch, a key US trade negotiator arrived in India yesterday to discuss 'trade issues' between Washington and New Delhi. Trump called Prime Minister Modi a ""dear friend"" and talked optimistically about the trade momentum. PM Modi, in turn, reaffirmed India and US as ""close friends and natural partners"" and expressed confidence that current trade talks would unlock significant potential for both nations. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said he had a ""wonderful call"" with PM Modi. ""I wished him a very Happy Birthday! He is doing a tremendous job. Narendra: Thank you for your support on ending the War between Russia and Ukraine! President DJT,"" he wrote. The Indian Prime Minister then thanked him for his birthday wishes. Easing trade tensions to boost export-oriented textile stocks: The cooling trade tensions between India and US provided much needed boost to the stock markets, as investors earlier remained worried over the impact of Trump's 50 percent tariff on India. All these developments reignited hopes for easing trade tensions between the two countries, which would likely benefit the export-oriented textile stocks. Motilal Oswal Financial Services said the markets are likely to be supported by encouraging developments in the ongoing US-India trade negotiations. ""A recent phone conversation between the US President and Indian Prime Minister on Modi’s birthday signals a willingness to ease tensions between the two major economies, further boosting investor sentiment,"" the domestic brokerage said.

SBI shares were trading at around Rs 857.40 apiece, extending gains for the third consecutive session. Yes Bank shares meanwhile were trading in the red with marginal losses at around Rs 20.94 apiece. About SMBC's deal to buy 20% stake in Yes Bank: Earlier in May this year, SMBC agreed to buy 20 percent stake in Yes Bank, marking one of the largest foreign investments in an Indian private bank. Following this deal, SMBC will emerge as the single-largest shareholder in Yes Bank. It was set to buy the largest chunk of over 13 percent stake from SBI (worth nearly Rs 8,889 crore), and the remaining (around 7 percent) from a group of Indian banks including Axis Bank, Bandhan Bank, Federal Bank, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, IDFC First Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank. These banks had originally invested in Yes Bank at around Rs 10 per share during its reconstruction phase in 2020. 'Largest cross-border investment in the Indian banking sector' ""The partial stake sale by SBI and other shareholder Banks in YBL to SMBC represents the largest cross-border investment in the Indian banking sector. The transaction has received the necessary regulatory and statutory approvals including from the Reserve Bank of India and the Competition Commission of India,"" SBI said in its press release. Following the divestment, SBI will continue to hold 10.8 percent stake in Yes Bank. Here's what SBI Chairman said on Yes Bank stake sale: ""Yes Bank restructuring plan by RBI in 2020 was an innovative, first of its kind public sector – private sector partnership that was fully supported and facilitated by Government of India. We are incredibly proud of the journey we have shared with Yes Bank in supporting their transformation since we came onboard as the major shareholder in 2020,"" said SBI Chairman Challa Sreenivasulu Setty. ""This is perhaps the best example of protecting the customer interests of a large bank by collaborative efforts of SBI and other banks under the guidance of Government of India and RBI. We are excited to welcome SMBC, a marquee financial institution, as a strategic partner through the largest cross-border transaction in India’s banking sector. Their global expertise will be a great complement to Yes Bank’s ongoing progress and future ambitions,"" he added.

Neutral NSDL; target of Rs 1200: Motilal Oswal,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/neutral-nsdl-target-of-rs-1200-motilal-oswal-13553372.html,"Motilal Oswal's research report on NSDL The opportunities for the entire Indian capital market ecosystem over the next decade, with a rising financialization trend but low penetration (demat penetration at 15% vs 60%+ in the US), continue to be immense (highlighted in our capital market thematic report). NSDL – the first depository of the country – is uniquely positioned to benefit from this trend, capturing both the breadth of new retail investors entering the system and the depth of rising custody value from institutional and corporate issuers. NSDL dominates in institutional, custodian, and large corporate accounts, resulting in revenue per active account at ~INR157 in FY25 — nearly 3x that of CDSL. The institutional skew offers more stable revenue pools linked to custody value rather than purely transaction volumes, underpinning resilience across market cycles. NSDL services the widest base of issuers in India, including ~70%+ of unlisted corporates mandated to dematerialize. This not only generates stable, recurring issuer charges but also creates a sticky moat, as issuers rarely migrate once demat systems are embedded. The potential growth for this is large, as the unlisted market in India continues to grow at a healthy pace. Outlook We expect a revenue/EBITDA/PAT CAGR of 5%/14%/15% over FY25-28. Given the duopoly nature of the industry and NSDL’s superior pricing power, depositories deserve premium valuations. However, we believe the stock is fairly valued, and all the positives are priced in at current levels. Hence, we initiate coverage on NSDL with a Neutral rating and a one-year TP of INR1,200 (premised on ~45x FY28E P/E).

"Defence shares extend rally to fourth day: GRSE, Cochin Shipyard, BEL rise up to 7%; here's why",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/defence-shares-extend-rally-to-fourth-day-grse-cochin-shipyard-bel-rise-up-to-7-here-s-why-13552972.html,"Defence shares extended their rally for the fourth straight session on Wednesday, with Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers (GRSE), Cochin Shipyard and Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL) among the major gainers. The Nifty India Defence index rose 2 percent in Wednesday’s trade, with all 18 constituents in positive territory. The index has gained 7.3 percent over the last four sessions. The sharp rally is witnessed on the back of strong investor interest and high trading volumes, following the Defence Ministry’s approval of the new Defence Procurement Manual (DPM) 2025. The revised framework aims to expedite revenue procurement for the armed forces, encourage domestic industry participation and align processes with modern warfare requirements, reported CNBC-TV18. According to the ministry, the manual is designed to ""streamline, simplify, enable and rationalise"" the procurement process, while officials said it would help maintain operational readiness through faster decision-making and timely resource availability. In Wednesday’s trade, shares of GRSE led the rally, rising 7.5 percent to touch an intraday high of Rs 2,624 on the NSE. The stock rebounded after two sessions of decline. A total of 2.7 lakh shares changed hands, generating a turnover of Rs 69.13 crore. The company’s market capitalisation stood at Rs 29,119.12 crore. On the NSE, volumes crossed 30.5 lakh shares by 11:30 am. Cochin Shipyard shares gained 2.5 percent to Rs 1,866 apiece on the NSE, while BEL advanced 2.16 percent to Rs 411.45 around 11:30 am.

"IT stocks gain for 2nd day on hopes of Fed rate cut: Persistent Systems, LTIM, others rise up to 2%",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/it-stocks-gain-for-2nd-day-on-hopes-of-fed-rate-cut-persistent-systems-ltim-others-rise-up-to-2-13553259.html,"The shares of Indian IT companies gained on September 17, as investors eagerly awaited a possible rate cut announcement by US Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell following the FOMC meeting later today. The Nifty IT index rose more than 0.8 percent in the morning, extending gains for the second consecutive session and emerging as one of the top sectoral gainers on the market today. Fed rate cut on the way? US Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell is set to announce the outcome of FOMC meeting which is being held from September 16 to September 17. Analysts estimate that the American central bank will cut rates this time — especially amid weak jobs data and rising pressure from President Donald Trump’s administration. Experts who spoke to Moneycontrol held different opinions regarding the quantum of rate cut that Fed chief Jerome Powell may announce today. Some opine that a 25 bps rate cut should be expected, while others hint at a bumper 50 bps cut. Very few, however, hold the view that the American central bank may keep the rates unchanged. A rate cut in the US is expected to increase the discretionary spending limit, which in turn benefits IT companies which derive a significant portion of their revenue from the North American market. Top IT gainers today: Persistent Systems shares were the top gainer on the index, rising more than 2 percent to trade at Rs 5,605 apiece. Mphasis and LTI Mindtree shares gained more than 1 percent each. Coforge, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Infosys shares rose around 0.8 percent each, while Tech Mahindra, HCL Tech and Wipro shares were up around 0.4 percent each. Notably, Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) has increased its stake in Tech Mahindra by a little over 2 percent, raising its holding from 8.836 percent to 10.84 percent, according to reports.

MCX shares rally 5 percent as Sebi chair Tuhin Kanta talks of steps to revive commodity derivatives,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/commodities/mcx-shares-rally-5-percent-as-sebi-chair-tuhin-kanta-talks-of-steps-to-revive-commodity-derivatives-13553252.html,"Shares of leading commodity derivatives exchange MCX are sharply higher by 5 percent tracking comments by market regulator Sebi's chairman Tuhin Kanta Pandey, who during the MCX Metals Summit 2025 said there are plans to set up a working group on agri and non-agri commodities to address the bottlenecks for the segment's volume growth. Sebi is of the view that enhanced institutional participation into the commodities market can bring in liquidity and make it more attractive as a tool for hedging, and regulations will be developed to ensure 'prudent institutional access', said the chairman. A proposal to allow FPIs to trade in non-cash, non-agricultural commodity derivative segment is also under examination. The chairman said the regulator will engage with the government to consider banks, insurers and pension funds to trade in these markets. This is in line with Sebi's plans to revive derivatives trading in agri-commodities, and the development was previously reported by Moneycontrol in July 2025. ""Strengthening India's commodity market is high on Sebi's regulatory and development agenda. We have already constituted a committee to recommend measures for deepening the agri-commodities segment. We will also constitute a working group for developing the non-agri commodities segment, including metals,"" said Tuhin Kanta Pandey. Citing ongoing supply chain disruption and tariff wars, Sebi chairman said a robust derivatives market provides a ""powerful shield allowing Indian producers and consumers to hedge against global price shocks."" This need is even more pronounced in the context of critical minerals, he added. ""Our approach will be multi-pronged. First, we will continue to strengthen the integrity and safety of the market. Measures like real-time margin collection and continued monitoring are non-negotiable. Second, we will foster market development and innovation. This means encouraging our exchanges to constantly evolve. Third, we aim to deepen and widen participation. Our markets are for large corporations, traders, importers and SMEs. They are also available for institutional investors such as mutual funds and AIFs who are increasingly recognising metals as an asset class that improves risk-adjusted returns for investors,"" Sebi chairman said."

"Tata Consumer targets premiumization of tea portfolio to take on HUL, shares higher by 3 percent",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/tata-consumer-targets-premiumization-of-tea-portfolio-to-take-on-hul-shares-higher-by-3-percent-13552895.html,"FMCG major Tata Consumer Products (TCPL) has plans to pursue premiumization of its tea portfolio to drive growth and unlock value for shareholders, spurring the shares higher by nearly 3 percent in early trade on September 17, with volumes higher than the one-month average of 10 lakh shares. The President of packaged beverages business for India and South Asia, Puneet Das confirmed the plans to seek premiumization of its portfolio to drive growth. TCPL offers packaged beverage products, including tea under different premium and economy brands, in both general trade and e-commerce routes with the offline mode contributing to 80 percent of sales. In the e-commerce channel, Tata Tea has sustained market leadership for three years, outpacing competitors, the company has said. A news report by Informist Media quoted Puneet Das telling reporters in Kolkata that the company will aim to reclaim volume leadership in the segment, which was ceded to Hindustan Unilever in 2017-18. Das added that the difference between TCPL and HUL's sales is less than a percent in terms of volume, and around 4-5 percent in value terms. Tatas are targetting a 6-8 percent total value growth in the tea segment for the fiscal, according to the June quarter earnings call. TCPL recently launched premium offerings in the tea category, including a green tea with L-Carnitine, an amino acid that helps burn fat, as well as brought in Sachin Tendulkar to endorse Organic India, a brand that the Tatas acquired in 2024. Aside of new launches and deeper distribution network, Tata Global said it aims to expand into towns with populations between 50,000 and 100,000 to increase market reach. Going forward, the management believes if the tea prices fall it may result in lower cost for consumers, but TCPL said it is confident of holding on to profit margins of 30 percent range by Q3FY26. ""If the tea prices come off rapidly, the locals will have access to lower tea prices. And therefore, as we see market prices moving, we will -- like I said, 34% to 36%, 37%, is a margin which we are comfortable with. I don't think this category, you can go beyond this and therefore, as -- if prices come down more dramatically, we will have to give up something in terms of consumer price as well. But overall, I would say, by Q3, you should see margins operating in this range. On a YTD basis, Tata Consumer shares are higher by 22 percent, and down 8 percent over last one year."
"Sensex up 313 pts, Nifty above 25,330: Optimism over US trade talks among key factors behind market rise",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sensex-up-300-pts-nifty-above-25-300-optimism-over-us-trade-talks-among-key-factors-behind-market-rise-13552775.html,"Indian benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty extended gains on September 17 on the back of multiple positive factors. Sensex gained around 313 points (nearly 0.4 percent) to close at 82,693.71. Nifty 50, meanwhile, rose 91 points (0.36 percent) to end the session at 25,330.25. PSU Bank stocks led gains, with IT, realty, auto and media stocks were also among the top gainers. FMCG, metal and pharma stocks, however, were trading in the red. Here are the possible key factors pushing the markets into the green: Cooling India-US trade tensions: Indo-US relations have seen some improvement in recent days with US President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreeing to resume trade talks. Brendan Lynch, a key US trade negotiator arrived in India yesterday to discuss 'trade issues' between Washington and New Delhi. Trump called Prime Minister Modi a ""dear friend"" and talked optimistically about the trade momentum. PM Modi, in turn, reaffirmed India and US as ""close friends and natural partners"" and expressed confidence that current trade talks would unlock significant potential for both nations. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said he had a ""wonderful call"" with PM Modi. ""I wished him a very Happy Birthday! He is doing a tremendous job. Narendra: Thank you for your support on ending the War between Russia and Ukraine! President DJT,"" he wrote. The Indian Prime Minister then thanked him for his birthday wishes. The cooling trade tensions between India and US provided much needed boost to the stock markets, as investors earlier remained worried over the impact of Trump's 50 percent tariff on India. Motilal Oswal Financial Services said the markets are likely to be supported by encouraging developments in the ongoing US-India trade negotiations. ""A recent phone conversation between the US President and Indian Prime Minister on Modi’s birthday signals a willingness to ease tensions between the two major economies, further boosting investor sentiment,"" the domestic brokerage said. Likelihood of Fed rate cut: The US Federal Reserve is holding its FOMC meeting from September 16 to September 17. The American central bank's chief Jerome Powell is set to announce the outcome of the meet later today. Analysts estimate that the Fed will cut rates this time — especially amid weak jobs data and rising pressure from President Donald Trump's administration. Rate cut decision by the US Federal Reserve impact the Indian stock market, as it weighs or boosts several rate sensitive stocks. For example, a rate cut in the US is expected to increase the discretionary spending limit, which in turn benefits IT companies which derive a significant portion of their revenue from the North American market. Also, investors expect a rate cut in the US to pave the way for a rate cut in India. The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is set to meet between September 29 and October 1. Any rate cut announcement by the RBI directly impacts the market. Weak US dollar: Rupee recorded its best start in three weeks, opening below the 88-mark on September 17. The currency opened at 87.82 against the dollar after closing the previous session at 88.05. This comes as dollar index remained week as investors awaited Fed’s FOMC meet outcome. ""Expectations of a 25 basis point rate cut by the US Federal Reserve in today's FOMC meeting, coupled with the US Dollar Index dropping to a 3.5-year low below the 96 mark, are likely to support market optimism,"" said Motilal Oswal Financial Services. ""The ongoing rally in the market is being driven by a combination of positive sentiments and fundamentals. The market expects the renewed India-U S trade talks to result in an agreement, culminating in the withdrawal of the 25% penal tariffs imposed on India. If expectations translate into reality, that would be a huge sentiment positive,"" said VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments. ""Fundamentally, the GST reform is expected to trigger an impressive demand spurt led by automobiles. Auto stocks have already rallied, discounting the expectations. White goods, particularly air conditioners, can be beneficiaries. NBFCs financing the purchase of white goods, too, have rallied. Some leading private sector banks like HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank are yet to participate in the rally. These stocks are fairly valued. The Fed is expected to cut rates by 25 bps tonight. More than the rate action the Fed commentary on the evolving economic outlook and the trajectory of future rate action will be closely watched by the market,"" he added.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Bandhan Bank, Ashok Leyland, KEI Industries, Amber Enterprises, Aadhar Housing, Phoenix Mills, and others on September 17?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-bandhan-bank-ashok-leyland-kei-industries-amber-enterprises-aadhar-housing-phoenix-mills-and-others-on-september-17-13551843.html,"Equity benchmark indices rebounded smartly, with the Nifty 50 gaining 0.7 percent on September 16 after minor profit booking in the previous session, supported by healthy market breadth. About 1,779 shares gained against 999 declining shares on the NSE. The market is expected to maintain bullish momentum after surpassing the August swing high. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Amol Athawale, VP-Technical Research at Kotak Securities Tech Mahindra | CMP: Rs 1,531.5  After its declining trend, Tech Mahindra is in the accumulation zone, where it is trading in a range-bound mode on the daily scale. However, recent bullish activity in the stock is indicating good strength. The stock is expected to break out of the range and witness bullish momentum from the current levels, with a favourable risk-reward perspective. For the next few trading sessions, Rs 1,475 could be the trend-decider level for the bulls. If it sustains above this level, we can expect a further uptrend towards Rs 1,630. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,630 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,475 Bandhan Bank | CMP: Rs 162.67  Post its short-term price correction, Bandhan Bank is available near its multiple support zone. The incremental volume activity near this support zone indicates that the downside is restricted. Therefore, the stock is expected to rebound and witness bullish momentum from the current levels. For positional traders, Rs 157 would be the decisive level. Trading above this level, the uptrend formation will continue till Rs 175. However, if it closes below Rs 157, traders may prefer to exit from trading long positions. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 175 Stop-Loss: Rs 157 Ashok Leyland | CMP: Rs 134.54  After the remarkable up move, Ashok Leyland has taken a breather over the last few sessions. The consolidation structure suggests a bullish continuation chart formation. Moreover, the stock comfortably closed above its short-term moving average. Therefore, the stock is likely to resume its uptrend from the current levels in the coming days. As long as the stock is trading above Rs 129, the bullish texture is likely to continue. Above this, the stock could move up to Rs 145. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 145 Stop-Loss: Rs 129 Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors KEI Industries | CMP: Rs 4,179.7  KEI Industries is one of the top performers in its sector over the past week. In the previous session, prices closed above the prior swing high of Rs 4,143 and were up by more than 2% during the day. At the start of September 2025, prices found support at the 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA), and we have seen a rally of more than 9%. As long as the price protects the EMA support of Rs 3,900, the overall bias is likely to remain positive. Additionally, for the past 5 trading sessions, prices have been protecting the prior day’s low on a closing basis, which is acting as a double confirmation. One can use dips towards Rs 4,100–4,130 levels as a buying opportunity, which could take prices higher towards Rs 4,280, followed by Rs 4,390. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 4,280, Rs 4,390 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,900 Amber Enterprises India | CMP: Rs 8,298  Amber Enterprises made a fresh record high near Rs 8,324 and outperformed its sector in the previous session. The stock has continued to inch higher in a higher high and higher low fashion. In the previous session, the stock gave a breakout of a larger Ascending Triangle pattern on the daily chart, which is a strong positive sign. However, for confirmation, follow-up buying is required. On the daily chart, for the past 6 sessions, every candle has closed in green, highlighting its strength. Also, the KST (Know Sure Thing) indicator has turned above the signal line and is also trading above the zero line, suggesting that good momentum is expected to continue. For now, a break above Rs 8,325 is required for bullish momentum to continue towards Rs 8,660, followed by Rs 8,900. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 8,660, Rs 8,900 Stop-Loss: Rs 7,990 Aadhar Housing Finance | CMP: Rs 537.8  On the daily chart, since July 2025, Aadhar Housing Finance was in a sideways trend, consolidating in a range of Rs 490–530. Bullish momentum in the previous session helped the stock give a breakout of this rectangular pattern, and prices also managed to close above it. Currently, Bollinger Bands have started to expand, with a spike in volumes, suggesting that volatility is likely to increase in the coming sessions. Along with this, the MACD has just given a bullish crossover, further supporting the overall stance. A break above Rs 545 can push prices higher towards Rs 570, followed by Rs 590. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 570, Rs 590 Stop-Loss: Rs 520 Vinay Rajani, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities Phoenix Mills | CMP: Rs 1,616  Phoenix Mills has broken out from a downward sloping trendline on the weekly chart.

Dr Reddy’s launches novel acid blocker Tegoprazan in India to tap $1 billion market,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/dr-reddy-s-launches-novel-acid-blocker-tegoprazan-in-india-to-tap-1-billion-market-13551538.html,"Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd. on Tuesday announced the launch of a novel gastrointestinal therapy in India, betting on a next-generation acid blocker to strengthen its branded portfolio in a market where nearly four in 10 people suffer from acid-related disorders. The Hyderabad-based drugmaker launched Tegoprazan, a potassium-competitive acid blocker (PCAB), under the brand name PCAB, according to a company statement Tuesday. The drug is indicated for conditions such as erosive and non-erosive gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and gastric ulcers, offering faster onset and longer pH control than conventional treatments, the company said. The rollout follows Dr. Reddy’s exclusive licensing deal with South Korea’s HK inno.N Corp. in 2022 to commercialize Tegoprazan in India and select emerging markets. The molecule is already approved in 21 countries, including South Korea and China, and has completed Phase III trials in the U.S. “We are happy to launch Tegoprazan in India, reinforcing our commitment to innovation in gastrointestinal disease treatment — a key focus area for us,” said M.V. Ramana, chief executive officer for branded markets at Dr. Reddy’s. “Our partnership with HK inno.N brings together complementary strengths to enhance patient access to an innovative molecule that addresses critical gaps in acid peptic disease management,” he added. Acid peptic disorders affect about 38% of India’s population, underscoring the commercial potential for new therapies. In a multinational clinical trial conducted by Dr. Reddy’s across India, South Africa and Russia, 99% of GERD patients on Tegoprazan achieved endoscopic healing by Week 8, the company said. HK inno.N CEO Dal-Won Kwak said the launch marks a milestone for the PCAB class in India. “We hope Tegoprazan will establish itself as a leading innovative therapy and contribute meaningfully to the improvement of gastrointestinal care,” he said. The introduction of Tegoprazan adds to Dr. Reddy’s established gastrointestinal portfolio, which includes brands such as Omez, Razo and Vono. Dr Reddy's has been expanding its branded generics and specialty offerings in India and emerging markets to offset pricing pressure in the US generics segment."

""I cannot talk about the future, but there was no fixed agenda, because of which he came here to visit the factory... It was just a courtesy visit. Two days ago, we received a call from the Collector, and he said Mr Chandrasekharan wants to visit. It was indeed a matter of pride for us... The defence requirements and capabilities in India have a lot of scope, throughout the sector..,"" Satyanarayan Nuwal said.

"Auto stocks rise up to 3% on GST 2.0, festive demand hopes: Here's what brokerages say",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/auto-stocks-rise-up-to-3-on-gst-reforms-festive-demand-hopes-here-s-what-brokerages-say-13550134.html,"The shares of auto companies gained on September 16, after recording losses in four out of the past five sessions. Brokerages remain bullish over the sector's outlook, suggesting strong upside potential for the stocks. The Nifty Auto index rose 0.84 percent to 26,986.75, according to data on NSE at 1.10 pm. This comes amid easing trade tensions between India and US, optimism over India-European Union trade deal and expectations of rising festive demand following GST reforms boosted investor sentiment. GST reforms: Centre recently announced strong cuts to the GST structure, which will take effect later this month. Analysts estimate that the GST rate cuts will strongly spur demand around Navratri, and benefit the automakers. Maruti Suzuki has seen a 15 percent increase in customer inquiries since the GST rate cut announcement, the automaker's Head of Sales and Marketing Partho Banerjee recently told CNBC-TV18. ""Overall bookings now stand at 1.5 lakh, with 10,000 new bookings coming in daily,"" he added. Cooling India-US trade tensions: Indo-US relations have seen some improvement in recent days with Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreeing to resume trade talks. Trump called Prime Minister Modi a ""dear friend"" and talked optimistically about the trade momentum. PM Modi, in turn, reaffirmed India and US as ""close friends and natural partners"" and expressed confidence that current trade talks would unlock significant potential for both nations. Brendan Lynch, a key US trade negotiator arrived today in India to discuss 'trade issues' between Washington and New Delhi. Special Secretary Rajesh Agarwal however clarified that Lynch's one-day visit is not the sixth round of trade negotiations between India and US, but only a meeting to 'discuss' trade issues. The cooling trade tensions between India and US, and increasing hopes of the two countries resuming trade talks may have boosted auto and auto ancillary stocks. India-EU trade deal: India and EU held their 13th round of talks for the proposed trade deal from September 8-12. The next round of talks will be held in Brussels from October 6-10 as both sides aim to conclude negotiations at the earliest. This too may act as a strong boost for the auto and auto ancillary stocks. MRF shares were the top gainers on the index, jumping nearly 3 percent to trade at Rs 1,51,780 apiece. Balkrishna Industries and Bharat Forge shares followed, rising around 2 percent each. Samvardhana Motherson, Bosch, Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M), Eicher Motors and Maruti Suzuki shares gained more than 1 percent each, while TVS Motor, Tube Investments of India and Hero MotoCorp shares were up around 1 percent each. Ashok Leyland, Bajaj Auto and Exide Industries shares were trading in the green with marginal gains. Bucking the trend, Tata Motors shares were trading in the red with marginal losses. HSBC on auto sector: HSBC in its latest report said that GST-driven price cuts announced by the automakers will boost their CAGR by 200-300 basis points over the next four-five years. The international brokerage noted that the auto stocks have jumped 6-17 percent since the centre's GST revision announcement in August. It added that this will likely track earnings growth. Growth could be front-loaded, HSBC said while raising FY27-28 EPS estimates across companies by 4–14 percent. Here are the latest rating and target prices set by the international brokerage:Maruti Suzuki – Buy call, Target price at Rs 17,000 per shareHyundai Motor India – Buy call, Target price at Rs 2,800 per shareTVS Motor – Buy call, Target price at Rs 4,000 per shareM&M – Buy call, Target price at Rs 4,000 per shareAther Energy – Buy call, Target price at Rs 600 per shareInCred on autos: InCred sees GST rate cuts and cess withdrawal as biggest stimulus for auto sector in recent history. It said that these could trigger a two-three year cyclical recovery. The domestic brokerage raised domestic auto volume forecasts by 300 bps to 11 percent for FY26, and by 500 bps to 15 percent for FY27, led by passenger vehicles. InCred has upgraded its ratings on Apollo Tyres, Escorts Kubota, M&M and Tata Motors. Nomura on autos: Nomura said the GST cuts are leading to early signs of demand recovery. It prefers M&M, Hyundai, TVS Motor and Ashok Leyland among the stocks. The cuts have translated into immediate benefits for buyers and firms are reporting stronger enquiries, surge in bookings and an improved outlook for festive demand, the brokerage said.

In the Air compression segment, Tezcatlipoca centrifugal compressors are witnessing strong traction and gaining market share. Refrigeration compressors continue to see robust demand from industrial and commercial end-users, with revenue contribution expected to rise to ~45% (vs ~35% earlier). The Gas compression segment remains subdued, although demand for gas booster packages continues to be healthy. KKPC’s continued new product launches, such as Tyche, are expected to drive the next leg of growth while new initiatives such as RenovAir replacement scheme is expected to pave way for market share gains. Looking ahead, management targets ~20% CAGR in revenues with EBITDA margins scaling up to ~20%, supported by market share gains, new product launches and eventual foray into export markets.

Market participants seek protocol after September’s last-minute holiday change shook the settlement system,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/market-participants-seek-protocol-after-september-s-last-minute-holiday-change-shook-the-settlement-system-13550137.html,"Earlier this month, stock exchanges had received an official communication about a holiday on Monday, September 8, which was previously scheduled on Friday, and while it looked like a routine adjustment, at the back end, this led to big chaos. Sebi’s settlement, which operates on T+1, had to move to T+2 for cash and T+3 for derivatives on short notice. From Sebi to brokers, custodians, foreign portfolio investors, mutual funds, and clearing corporations, everyone has a story to share about how this last-moment tweak forced them to burn the midnight oil to resolve the settlement issues. Thankfully, the settlement was completed without any major issue, but it created chaos at the back end. What Exactly Happened? Once the Maharashtra government announced the change in holiday which was scheduled on September 5, banking regulator RBI changed the bank’s holiday to Monday, September 8, as it had to follow states’ holiday calendar as per the Negotiable Instruments Act. RBI communicated the change in holiday to banks and other entities, and when banks are on holiday, fund settlements can’t happen, leaving investors to wait for their funds. How Did the Tweak Impacted the Market? The stock exchanges and clearing corporations make the settlement calendars a year in advance, based on the dates of holidays, and any changes midway can disrupt the whole cycle. How Did FPIs get Impacted? Foreign Portfolio Investors book their foreign exchange based on a TOMO basis - in simple terms, based on tomorrow’s expected price. In this instance, the forex was booked for Monday, and Friday was a holiday as per the earlier plan. In this case, the calculation and fund arrangement went for a toss. Given that the FPIs trade in huge quantities, any change in forex price can impact the cost of trading. How Did Investors get Impacted? Investors were impacted as the funds expected to be credited into their accounts got delayed, leading to to additional margin requirement as previous margins had got blocked. The BTST or Buy Today Sell Tomorrow trade also got impacted as traders could not get the sale money the next day. The settlement for the derivative segment of three trade days - September 4 (Thursday), September 5 (Friday), and September 8 (Monday) - was undertaken on September 9 (Tuesday). Similarly, the settlement for the cash and SLBM segment for September 8 (Monday) and September 9 (Tuesday) was undertaken on September 10 (Wednesday). Exchanges and clearing corporations had to break the settlement part into two days, otherwise the settlement system would have crashed because of the sheer size of trading volume. Stock exchanges, clearing corporations, custodians, and the regulator had to literally burn the midnight oil to ensure smooth settlement. Custodians Worked till 4 AM As per industry sources, custodians and fund accounting teams had to work till early morning to prepare the files for settlement. Not only this, one industry insider said they also had to face FPI queries on how there could be a sudden change in holidays. Some FPIs even mocked the ‘one nation, multiple regulations’ approach, as they could not understand the nuances of local rules. Corporate Action Trigger Market participants concur that a big chaos was averted as there were no major corporate actions except a few dividend issues. If a bonus announcement or some other issue had been effective from Monday, it could have become an issue, as investors who were eligible may have lost the opportunity because of settlement issues. For example, if one had bought shares on Friday on a cum basis and expected to get them on Monday as Friday was a settlement holiday, but the settlement moved to Tuesday. In such a case, they may have lost significantly as they would have received shares on an ex basis – without the bonus shares and prices adjusted accordingly. In such situations, companies cannot be suddenly asked to change their record dates. Incidentally, exchanges were working on both days, Friday and Monday. Sebi and exchanges also issued an alert to investors about the impact on corporate action ex-date and cum-date. MF Debt Schemes Impacted Market participants said debt fund transactions too were impacted due to the sudden change in holiday schedule. As payments are not processed on holidays but the next business day, unit prices change, and investors get the NAV of the next business day. How to Avoid Chaos Next Time? In a situation like this, market participants said the regulators should have a formal way of communication and assess if the regulated entities get impacted because of the tweaks. It will help the market handle things smoothly. They also said that once the trading day starts, the date of settlement should not change. Some participants also say when 24x7 systems like NEFT, RTGS, and UPI are there, then do we really need a settlement calendar?"

India revokes Novartis' patent for blockbuster heart drug,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/india-revokes-novartis-patent-for-blockbuster-heart-drug-13550194.html,"Indian Patent Office (IPO) has revoked Novartis AG’s patent on its blockbuster heart-failure drug Entresto, sold as Vymada in India, saying the Swiss drug company’s claims lacked novelty. Vymada is widely prescribed for hypertension and heart failure. For Novartis, the drug is a major revenue driver, generating $7.8 billion in global sales last year. The September 12 decision by the deputy controller of patents and designs could pave the way for affordable generics. While cancelling the patent for the “supramolecular complex” of sacubitril and valsartan, the active ingredients in Vymada, D Usha Rao said Novartis failed to show any clear therapeutic advantage of its claimed “supramolecular complex” over existing formulations. The order followed a post-grant opposition filed by the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA), an industry group representing major domestic drugmakers. Two companies — IPCA and Micro Labs — also opposed the patent at the post‑grant stage. “The patentee has failed to disclose any demonstrated advantages or technical advancement of the claimed supramolecular complex over the combination already disclosed…,” the controller wrote in the order. Moneycontrol has reviewed a copy of the order. “No experimental data, comparative studies, or technical rationale have been provided to substantiate any enhanced efficacy. Further, no improved therapeutic efficacy has been shown,” Rao said. The patent fell foul of multiple provisions of the Patents Act. The ruling caps nearly two years of litigation that began in December 2023 when IPA challenged the patent on grounds of lack of novelty, prior claiming, obviousness, and insufficiency of disclosure. The opposing parties twice recommended revocation and after a Delhi High Court-directed round of rebuttal evidence, the controller held a final hearing on August 20. Novartis’s representatives abstained from the proceedings, the order said. On February 13, 2009, Novartis was granted a patent for a drug combining valsartan and sacubitril. That patent expired on January 16, 2023, paving the way for dozens of copycats. Novartis then claimed that a particular crystalline form, for which it was granted patent, was essential to Entresto's function, and blocked generic drugmakers from copying its crystalline form. Indian firms opposed the patent, questioning whether the crystalline form offered a therapeutic advantage over earlier ones.. The controller sided with the opponents, who argued that the patent was an attempt at “evergreening” — extending monopoly rights without meaningful innovation — a practice India’s patent law seeks to curb. Novartis spokesperson declined to comment. The drugmaker can appeal the decision in the Delhi High Court."
