Smallcaps tumble up to 77% as broader indices lag,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/smallcaps-tumble-up-to-77-as-broader-indices-lag-13585260.html,"The broader indices broke a three-week gaining streak and underperformed the main indices as markets remained under pressure throughout the week on worries over fresh tariffs on pharma, higher visa fees by the US, persistent trade concerns, and continued FII selling. For the week, Nifty50 plunged 672.35 points or 2.65 percent to finish at 24,654.70, while the BSE Sensex index declined 2199.77 points or 2.66 percent to end at 80,426.46. BSE mid, large, and smallcap indices declined 3-4.5 percent. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) remained net sellers throughout the week, extending their selling for the 13th consecutive week, as they offloaded equities worth Rs 19,570.03 crore, while Domestic Institutional Investors (DII) continued their buying in 24nd week, as they purchased equities worth Rs 17,411.40 crore. For the month, FII sold equities worth Rs 30,141.68 crore, while DII bought equities worth Rs 55,736.09 crore. All the sectoral indices gave a negative return during the week, with the Nifty IT index plunging 8 percent, the Nifty Realty index shedding 6 percent, the Nifty Pharma index falling 5.2 percent, the  Nifty Consumer Durables slipping 4.6 percent, Nifty Defence index declining 4.4 percent. ""This week, the overall market breadth of the Indian equity markets was negative as it factored in the US announcement with respect to H1B visas and the pharma sector. The BSE Sensex and the NSE Nifty index fell in excess of 2% and the decline in the BSE Midcap and the BSE Smallcap was higher at ~4%,"" said Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities. ""All the key sectoral indices ended the week in the red. The US announced stricter norms on H1B visas. Accenture’s FY26 revenue guidance assumes no improvement in discretionary spending at the top end and some deterioration at the bottom end. THE BSE IT index corrected by 7% this week. The BSE healthcare index corrected ~5% this week amid the US announcing 100% tariffs on branded or patented pharma products imported into the US."" ""Auto stocks remained in focus as news reports indicate healthy booking and deliveries in the initial days of the current festive season. Global equity markets were mixed in the past week, with developed markets outperforming the emerging markets. The key global news-flows impacting global markets included continued uncertainty around US trade policies and the ECB maintaining a cautious outlook on growth,"" he added. The BSE Small-cap index declined 4.2 percent with Shankara Building Products, Apollo Pipes, SML Isuzu, MIC Electronics, Prudent Corporate Advisory Services, Sigachi Industries, Cigniti Technologies, SMS Pharmaceuticals, Eimco Elecon (India), Vishnu Prakash R Punglia, IOL Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals, Parsvnath Developers shed up to 77 percent. Zuari Industries, TVS Electronics, Indo Thai Securities, OM Infra, RACL Geartech,Allcargo Terminals, Automotive Stampings and Assemblies rising between 20-30 percent.  Where is Nifty50 headed? Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Sustained weakness in heavyweights has accelerated the index’s decline over the past two sessions, with the Nifty now approaching its key support near the 200 DEMA around 24,400. Meanwhile, the sharp correction in mid- and small-cap stocks has further dampened market sentiment. Given this backdrop, we recommend adopting a cautious approach—focusing on fundamentally strong stocks while avoiding aggressive directional bets until clearer signals emerge. Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities A long bear candle was formed on the daily chart on Friday, which indicates a decisive breakdown of crucial supports of around 25000-24900 levels. This is not a good sign and signals more weakness in the short term. A long bear candle has been formed in Nifty on the weekly chart after three weeks of rise, which indicates a possibility of faster downside retracement in the market. The underlying trend of Nifty is sharply negative and the market is now sliding down to the next important support of around 24400-24300 (previous swing lows and 200-day EMA) by next week. Immediate resistance is placed at 24850 levels. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The Nifty broke below the crucial support level of 25,000, which triggered a decline and led to the breach of other intermediate supports. The sentiment remains weak, with immediate and critical support placed in the 24,550–24,500 zone. A decisive breakdown below 24,500 could extend the correction towards 24,150, which corresponds to the 38.20% Fibonacci retracement of the rally from 21,743 to 25,669. On the other hand, if the index holds above 24,500, a sharp recovery can be expected. Amol Athawale, VP Technical Research, Kotak Securities Technically, on weekly charts, Nifty has formed a long bearish candle. On intraday charts, it is holding a lower top formation, which supports further weakness from the current levels. We believe that the short-term market trend is weak, but due to temporary oversold conditions, we could see a pullback rally from the current levels. For traders, 24,800/81200 would act as a key level to watch. Below this, the correction wave is likely to continue. On the downside, the market could retest the levels of 24,500/80300. Further declines may also occur, potentially dragging the index down to 24,350/79800, 24300/79600. Conversely, above 24,800/81200, a pullback formation could continue up to 25,000-25,100/81800-82200. For Bank Nifty, the 20-day SMA or 54,750 would be a crucial zone. Below this, the chances of hitting 54,000-53,800 increase. However, if it sustains above the 20-day SMA or 54,750, it could bounce back to the 50-day SMA or 55,300-55,500. Short-term traders should remain cautious and be very selective, as there is a risk of getting trapped at lower levels.

"Wall Street ends streak of weekly gains, yields rise as investors digest data",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/wall-street-ends-streak-of-weekly-gains-yields-rise-as-investors-digest-data-13585236.html,"Gains in Wall Street indexes on Friday were not enough to erase a loss for the week while resilient consumer spending supported longer-dated Treasury yields and gold rose as a steady inflation reading supported bets on future Federal Reserve rate cuts. Consumer spending climbed slightly more than expected in August while the inflation rate rose to 2.7% from 2.6% in July, data showed, in line with economists' expectations. Analysts said some companies had fended off price pressures by stockpiling in anticipation of tariffs, but some volatility was to be expected ahead of corporate earnings releases in the coming weeks. ""Corporates have been able to withstand (a) tariff hit because they've had inventory build. But the earnings season will become the bigger test because many companies have told us they will start some price increases around the end of the year,"" said Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at Charles Schwab. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.65%, the S&P 500 rose 0.59% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.44%. Individual stocks responded to fresh White House tariffs on goods including pharmaceuticals and trucks. Paccar, which makes most of its trucks for the U.S. market domestically, gained 5%, and drugmaker Eli Lilly rose 1.5%. Richmond Fed Bank President Thomas Barkin told Bloomberg Television he had very low confidence in inflation forecasts, as tariffs continue to impact the economy.The prospect of a potential government shutdown is also adding uncertainty and could disrupt the data releases that investors follow closely for guidance. NOT FALLING OFF A CLIFF Friday's personal consumption expenditures index functions as a key component of the Federal Reserve's inflation outlook. U.S. Treasury yields, which influence borrowing costs, moved little after the data was released. The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes rose 0.7 basis points to 4.181%, from 4.174% late on Thursday. The 30-year bond yield rose 0.5 basis points to 4.7576% from 4.753% late on Thursday. ""The one bright spot was that income and spending were a little bit firmer than expected, which means the consumer isn't falling off a cliff as the market was expecting,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, head of U.S. rates strategy at TD Securities. Gold, a safe haven which usually benefits from lower interest rates, broadly held on to recent gains. Spot prices were last quoted 0.46% higher at $3,766.25 an ounce.Investors now estimate an 89.8% probability of a rate cut in October and a 67% chance of another in December, the CME FedWatch Tool shows. The Fed made its first interest rate cut of the year last week, and signalled further easing was to come. Fed Chair Jerome Powell offered little more direction at a speech on Tuesday, saying the central bank needed to continue balancing, opens new tab the risk of high inflation against a weakening job market. Oil prices rose as Ukrainian drone attacks on Russia infrastructure cut the major energy producer's exports. Brent futures settled at $70.13 a barrel, up 71 cents, or 1.02%. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude finished at $65.72 a barrel, gaining 74 cents, or 1.14%."
Trump’s dual shocks thwart bets on Indian stock market rebound,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/trump-s-dual-shocks-thwart-bets-on-indian-stock-market-rebound-13585213.html,"Call it a case of bad timing for Indian stock bulls. Donald Trump has dealt two fresh blows to investor sentiment just as the market was showing signs of a turnaround. The MSCI India Index has fallen in all five sessions since the US President signed an order to overhaul the H-1B visa program — a move that risks disrupting India’s $280 billion software services industry. His plan to impose a 100% duty on branded or patented pharmaceuticals saw Indian drugmakers join an Asia-wide selloff on Friday. Prior to these shocks, the MSCI India gauge had risen for three straight weeks, adding more than 4% in what was its longest run since May. Trump’s latest salvos have also shaken foreign investors, who seemed to be finally putting in their stride the punishing 50% US tariffs on India that have soured relations between the two nations. Global funds turned sellers of Indian shares in recent sessions following two weeks of purchases.  “Escalating US–India tensions add another layer of pressure,” said Jian Shi Cortesi, a fund manager at GAM Investment Management in Zurich. “The related headlines provide investors with an additional nudge to reallocate away from India toward markets displaying stronger momentum, such as China and South Korea.” Constrained by a slowdown in economic growth as well as the pace of corporate earnings expansion, Indian stocks have struggled to keep their momentum in 2025 after rallying for six straight years. The MSCI India gauge has risen around 2% this year, trailing a broader gauge of Asian equities by over 19 percentage points after outperforming it over 2021-2024. Expectations Reset Investors were pinning hopes on a year-end rally in stocks, buoyed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s move earlier to lower nationwide consumption tax — which took effect on Sept. 22, the central bank’s continued focus on growth, and bets that the resumption of trade negotiations with the US will lead to a positive outcome. Those expectations are being reviewed following Trump’s latest actions. The MSCI India gauge’s about 3% decline this week was its biggest since February. A measure of IT stocks lost 7.9% over five sessions, the most since April. The tech sector commands a near-10% weighting on the MSCI gauge — the third-highest. Indians have made up more than 70% of the H-1B visas in the past. Economists have warned that the visa changes risk cutting remittance inflows, and could weaken the local currency, already among Asia’s worst performers. The rupee slid to a record low on Tuesday amid worries that India’s services exports could suffer alongside its tariff-hit merchandise exports. An index of drugmakers lost over 2% on Friday to register its worst daily performance since early August following Trump’s latest tariff salvo.  “The underperformance of Indian asset prices looks set to continue,” Gavekal Research’s analysts Udith Sikand and Tom Miller wrote in a note. “The longer the 50% tariffs remain in place, the more likely it is that India’s economic growth disappoints.” Foreign funds have sold Indian stocks worth around $16 billion on a net basis in 2025. That’s on track to be the second-biggest ever outflow following a record $17 billion withdrawal in 2022. The market’s performance would have been much worse this year, if not for the strong equity purchases by local institutions. ‘Quiet Corner’ Some market watchers, such as strategists at HSBC Holdings Plc, are more optimistic. A team led by Herald van der Linde this week upgraded their stance on Indian stocks to overweight from neutral. “In stark contrast to the crowded trades in Korea and Taiwan, India is Asia’s quiet corner,” they wrote. “While earnings growth expectations can fall a little further, valuations are no longer a concern, government policy is becoming a positive factor for equities, and most foreign funds are lightly positioned.” The MSCI India gauge is trading at 21.8 times its 12-month forward earnings, down from a multiple of 24.5 a year ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Overall, investors agree that the near-term outlook for Indian equities, particularly in terms of foreign flows, will continue to be determined by geopolitics. Allspring Global Investments is among those adding exposure to domestically driven sectors such as consumer and financials, which are less vulnerable to Trump’s America First agenda. Hedging costs for Indian equities also climbed this week for the first time in a month. A gauge of 30-day ahead volatility on the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. closed above its 50-day moving average Friday, suggesting traders are bracing for heightened market volatility. Gary Dugan, chief executive officer of the Global CIO Office, said he would shift portfolios toward China and potentially to Latin America if geopolitical tensions with the US spiral."
Sun Pharma may face tariff turbulence in US but HSBC sees limited earnings risk,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/sun-pharma-may-face-tariff-turbulence-in-us-but-hsbc-sees-limited-earnings-risk-13585078.html,"Sun Pharma, India’s largest drugmaker, finds itself in the spotlight following US President Donald Trump’s announcement of a 100% import tariff on branded or patented pharmaceutical products, effective October 1, 2025. While the move is expected to shake up global pharma supply chains, HSBC believes the earnings impact on Sun Pharma may be limited. “Among Indian companies, only Sun Pharma has sizeable sales from patented products in the U.S.,” noted Damayanti Kerai, Analyst, India Healthcare at HSBC. “It reported global sales of $1.2 billion from patented products in FY25, of which the US market accounted for approximately $1.1 billion amounting to 17% of total revenue and 8–10% of consolidated EPS.” Sun Pharma’s patented portfolio, led by its blockbuster psoriasis drug Ilumya, is largely manufactured by global CDMO partners outside US. The drug substance for Ilumya is produced in South Korea, while the finished dose is made in Europe. This fragmented supply chain could complicate tariff compliance. “While this tariff development is broadly negative for Sun Pharma, we think the impact on earnings depends on multiple moving parts—spread of supply chain, IP location of the brand, and use of third-party manufacturers,” Kerai explained. HSBC outlines several mitigation strategies for Sun Pharma, including shifting manufacturing to CDMO partners with US-based plants, leveraging its own three manufacturing facilities in the US, or even acquiring a new plant. With over $3 billion in cash reserves as of June 2025, Sun Pharma has the financial muscle to act. However, HSBC cautions that “moving supply chains, tech-transfer, and plant re-purposing would take considerable time—anywhere from 6 to 24 months.” In its base case, HSBC estimates an 8–10% downside risk to Sun Pharma’s FY26–27 earnings if mitigation measures are delayed or ineffective. Yet, the brokerage remains optimistic. “We maintain our Buy rating and INR 1,850 target price, with no estimate changes,” Kerai affirmed.As the industry awaits Sun Pharma’s official response, the company’s ability to navigate this geopolitical curveball will be closely watched—not just by investors, but by the broader Indian pharma sector. An email sent to Sun Pharma seeking comment on possible impact of the Trump's tariff announcement is yet to elicit response at the time of publishing the story."
Trump’s 100% drug tariff: A mixed bag for India’s CRDMO industry,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/trump-s-100-drug-tariff-a-mixed-bag-for-india-s-crdmo-industry-13585063.html,"US President Donald Trump’s decision to impose a 100 percent import tariff on branded and patented pharmaceutical products from October 1, 2025, may be a mixed bag for India’s Contract Research, Development, and Manufacturing Organisation (CRDMO) sector.India’s pharmaceutical exports to the U.S. stood at $8.73 billion in 2024, accounting for 31 percent of total pharma exports. However, the bulk of these exports are generic drugs, which remain exempt from the new tariff. This offers a temporary cushion to Indian drugmakers, but the long-term impact on the CRDMO sector could be more complex. “Few Indian pharma companies with exposure to non-U.S. domiciled branded formulation or innovator drug companies, who in turn export to the U.S., may face challenges,” said Deepak Jotwani, VP & Sector Head, ICRA. The BCG-IPSO whitepaper “Unleashing the Tiger” highlights India’s growing CRDMO sector, currently valued at $3–3.5 billion, with ambitions to scale to $22–25 billion by 2035. The sector is riding high on global supply chain realignment, pricing pressures, and rising demand for new modalities like biologics and cell therapies. However, Trump’s tariff announcement introduces a new layer of uncertainty. While generics are spared, ambiguity remains around complex generics, specialty medicines, and biologics, segments where Indian CRDMOs are increasingly active. If these are eventually included under the tariff umbrella, Indian firms engaged in R&D and manufacturing for U.S.-bound branded drugs could face headwinds. India’s CRDMOs often serve as contract developers and manufacturers for global pharma giants. If these clients are hit by tariffs, the ripple effect could squeeze margins for Indian CDMOs, especially those involved in high-volume, low-margin production. The Trump administration’s Section 232 investigation into pharma imports, covering APIs, intermediates, and finished drugs, adds further uncertainty, with a final decision expected by March 2026. Despite the risks, the tariff could also accelerate the shift toward cost-effective alternatives, benefiting India’s generics and CRDMO segments in the short term. The BCG-IPSO report notes that India’s CRDMOs enjoy a 70–80% workforce cost advantage and 85% lower infrastructure setup costs compared to the West. With faster project startup times and improved IP regimes, India remains a preferred outsourcing destination. Moreover, companies with US manufacturing facilities under construction are exempt from the tariff, offering a strategic path to mitigate exposure. Several Indian CRDMOs are already expanding footprints in the US, UK, and Europe, positioning themselves as global partners. Syngene International, Cohance are two CRDMOs that have recently acquired facilities in the US. Piramal Pharma, which has facilities both in US and India, offers more flexibility to its customers. But analysts say that the Indian CRDMO industry has to invest on talent, accelerate innovation in biologics and new modalities, diversify markets beyond the US and strengthen local supplier ecosystems to reduce dependency on China and the West."

The decline was broad-based, with pharma and IT stocks leading the fall following U.S. tariff announcements on branded drugs. The broader indices bore the brunt of the sell-off, slipping nearly 2% each. The announcement of tariffs on branded drugs weighed heavily on sentiment, adding to recent concerns over visa policy changes. IT counters were further dragged by weak guidance from global peers, while persistent FII outflows and a weak rupee amplified the pressure. On the technical front, sustained weakness in heavyweights has accelerated the index’s decline over the past two sessions, with the Nifty now approaching its key support near the 200 DEMA around 24,400.

Given this backdrop, we recommend adopting a cautious approach—focusing on fundamentally strong stocks while avoiding aggressive directional bets until clearer signals emerge. Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments The Indian market experienced a bloodbath, mirroring the rout across Asian markets. Investor sentiment was rattled by a fresh wave of tariffs targeting the pharmaceuticals, dragging pharma stocks deep into the red.

Gold and silver prices have been hitting fresh record highs consecutively for several sessions this month, dodging market volatility. Jewellery stocks decline: PC Jeweller shares dropped nearly 10 percent to trade at Rs 12.14 apiece. Kalyan Jewellers and Senco Gold shares fell over 3 percent to Rs 448 apiece. PN Gadgil Jewellers and Titan shares meanwhile fell over 2 percent each.

Contracts with December expiry meanwhile hit a lifetime high of Rs 1,14,198 per 10 grams. Domestic gold prices also jumped. The prices have now consolidated slightly, but still remain high. Silver accompanying gold: Along with gold, silver futures also hit fresh lifetime highs. Silver futures with December expiry hit a fresh lifetime high of Rs 1,38,184 per kg earlier this week. The future contracts with March expiry hit an all time high of Rs 1,39,626 per kg today. Analysts note that customers may pause their jewellery purchases when the precious metals are at such high levels. Demand for ornaments is likely to fall 27 percent from a year ago in terms of volume during the three-week buying period, Bloomberg quoted Surendra Mehta, national secretary at the India Bullion and Jewellers Association, as saying. Consumers, especially in big cities, are postponing spending due to high costs, he added. ""The rally is supported by the Fed’s dovish rate-cut outlook and expectations of further easing into late 2025, keeping liquidity strong in bullions. Global uncertainties and declining dollar dependence continue to fuel buying interest in Gold and Silver,"" said Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst - Commodity and Currency, LKP Securities.

This is a nine-month high for the shares of L&T. ""After detailed negotiations, with an objective to expedite the phase 2 approval by GoI, it was agreed in principle that the State government would take over Phase-I Metro Rail project by taking over the debt of the project, which now stands at about Rs 13,000 cr. Further, the state government will pay about Rs 2,000 cr to L&T towards their equity investment in LTMRHL as a one-time settlement,"" PTI News reported citing people familiar with the development. The news report added that L&T had last month expressed interest in offloading its stake in the Metro Rail project citing operational and accumulated losses, following which the decision was taking in a meeting between Chief Minister A Revanth Reddy and senior officials with L&T group CMD S N Subrahmanyan. The Group had been exploring divestment options of non-core assets and various alternatives to de-risk exposure in L&T Metro Rail (Hyderabad). A consortium of 10 lenders, including State Bank of India has sanctioned the debt for the project. L&T Metro - Financials L&T Hyderabad Metro Rail's revenue from operations for FY25 was Rs 1,108.54 crore versus Rs 1,399.31 crore a year ago, a fall of 21 percent, with loss increasing by 13 percent on year, owing to delays and cost overrun. The SPV posted a loss of Rs 208 crore in Q1FY26 as compared to a loss of Rs 214 crore in Q1 FY25. . The EBITDA for Hyderabad metro was Rs 101 crore during Q1FY25 and stands at Rs 112 crore in Q1FY26. ""...at the current level of roughly Rs 12,500-odd crore of debt, the Hyderabad metro interest averages around Rs 240-250 crore,"" the company had said in the June quarter earnings call, which has resulted in a loss worth Rs 208 crore on L&T's books in Q1FY26. JM Financial in a note said it expects L&T to surpass its 18 percent target of RoE in FY26 once Hyderabad Metro losses end, and interest income adds up. About Hyderabad Metro The Hyderabad metro rail system comprises of three elevated corridors from Miyapur to LB Nagar, Jubilee Bus Station to Mahatma Gandhi Bus Station and Nagole to Raidurg, covering a total network of 69.2 km. The metro network was commissioned in phases, with the final stretch being commissioned in February 2020. In May 2025, the fare per passenger has been revised upwards on a net basis by 20 percent over existing fares. Other Recent Triggers L&T has recently announced a strategic partnership with BEL for the 5th-gen fighter (AMCA) programme, under which it will be submitting an Expression of Interest (EoI) for the project soon. The company is also working on semiconductor products that are expected to be released next year, with the CEO of unit, Sandeep Kumar, stating that the semiconductor arm will consider an IPO after crossing the $500 million mark in revenue, according to ICICI Direct."

Margin tailwinds from price increases (in soaps), premiumisation and cost efficiency measures should drive profit growth ahead of revenue, making it a compelling medium-term compounder.

Key highlights from the interaction are as follows: 1) the company holds ~6% market share in domestic cables & wires (C&W) and exports to over 74 countries (with Israel recently added to the list); 2) a higher share of in-house manufacturing for key raw materials drives strong backward integration; 3) it has planned capex of INR12.0b spread over the next three years to expand its cable capacity, supporting ~18% CAGR in C&W revenue during this period; and 4) better product mix (increase in cables share) and scale improvement are expected to expand margins. Outlook We estimate RRKABEL’s revenue/EBITDA/PAT CAGR at 15%/22%/19% over FY25- 28. We estimate its C&W segment margin at 7.8%/8.0%/8.2% in FY26/FY27/FY28 vs. 7.4% in FY25. We project the net debt (excluding acceptances) to increase to INR8.6b by FY28 vs. INR1.1b in FY25, led by higher capex. The stock is trading fairly at 36x/32x FY26E/27E EPS.

Carysil shares plunge up to 10% after Trump imposes 50% tariffs on kitchen equipment imports,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/carysil-shares-plunge-up-to-10-after-trump-imposes-50-tariffs-on-kitchen-equipment-imports-13582458.html,"The shares of Carysil plunged as much as 10 percent on September 26 after US President Donald Trump announced 50 percent tariff on imported kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, and a 30 percent tariff on upholstered furniture. The stock then made some recovery after the company clarified that the recent announcement doesn't include kitchen sink. Hence, it won't have any impact on the company. What does Carysil do? Carysil, which is known for manufacturing quartz kitchen sinks, is also known for its exports. Trump's latest announcement may have dampened investor sentiment, leading to the selloff. According to Carysil's Annual Report 2024-2025, 21.5 percent of its revenue came from the US market, while 17.7 percent came from India. The freshly announced tariffs will be effective from October 1. ""The reason for this is the large scale 'FLOODING' of these products into the United States by other outside Countries,"" Trump said. Carysil share price history: The shares of Carysil later recovered some losses to trade 5 percent lower at Rs 806.40 apiece. The stock has fallen nearly 12 percent in the past five days, but gained around 27 percent in the past six months. Its P/E ratio currently stands at nearly 34. Newly-listed Euro Pratik Sales shares also dropped more than 3 percent to trade at Rs 235 apiece after Trump’s latest announcement. The company exports wall panel products to over 60 nations.

"Generic medicines exempted from Trump’s 100% pharma tariffs, but uncertainty continues",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/generic-medicines-exempted-from-trump-s-100-pharma-tariffs-but-uncertainty-continues-13581812.html,"Indian pharma exports, which are primarily low-cost generic or copycat medicines, may not be impacted by US President Donald Trump's latest announcement of 100 percent tariffs on “any branded or patented"" drugs imported into the US from October 1. While generic drugs are exempted, companies still face uncertainty over tariffs due to an  investigation order by the US government under Section 232 to see whether pharma imports pose a threat to national security. ""The latest tariff announcement is for branded or patented drugs, and not applicable to generics,"" Sudarshan Jain, Secretary General, Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA), told Moneycontrol. IPA represents large homegrown pharmaceutical companies that have a significant exposure to the US market. Trump, however, said that exceptions would be made for pharmaceutical companies that are building manufacturing plants in the US or have broken ground to set up manufacturing plants. ""India, being an exporter of generic drugs, is unlikely to be impacted by this. But perhaps the president’s next target can be generic drugs. This decision may have a sentimental impact on pharmaceutical stocks,"" said VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited. Sun Pharma, India's largest drugmaker, which sells specialty branded drugs in the US, may have some impact.  Specialty sales in the US rose 17.1 percent year-on-year, reaching $1.216 billion, and accounted for 19.7 percent of Sun Pharma’s consolidated revenues, up from 18 percent in FY24. Shares of Sun Pharma were down 1.79 percent and were trading at Rs 1,598.85 at 10 am on the BSE on September 26, while the BSE healthcare index declined 1.42 percent. Analysts say that generic medications play a critical role in keeping the costs of US healthcare system under check, giving them some shield against aggressive tariff actions. The US has, so far, withheld tariffs on generic medications, while levying it 50 percent on most of the other goods, which includes a 25 percent penal tariff for buying Russian oil. That said, the tariff threat isn't over for pharma companies as the Trump administration ordered investigation under the Section 232, launched by the US Department of Commerce, under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, to assess whether pharma imports pose a threat to national security. The investigation covers finished drugs, active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), key starting materials, and medical countermeasures. A final report is due by December 27, 2025, with a presidential decision expected by March 2026. Still, the threat of pharma-specific tariffs has prompted Indian firms to consider portfolio realignment and manufacturing shifts. Indian pharmaceutical executives are concerned that tariffs above 10 percent could make high-volume, low-margin products unviable, forcing them to cease supplies. India exported pharmaceuticals worth $8.73 billion to the US in 2024, accounting for 31 percent of its total pharma exports. Indian generics make up nearly half of all drugs covered by Medicare and commercial insurance plans, saving the US healthcare system $219 billion in 2022 alone. Lacks clarity It remains unclear whether Trump’s trade deals with the UK, Europe and Japan offer any protection to brand-name drugs imported to the US or would alter any terms of those deals. The US signed trade deals with the UK, Europe and Japan that imposes 10-15 percent tariffs on their exports. Nearly all of the biggest multinational drugmakers have a significant manufacturing presence in Europe, from where they exports drugs to the US. If branded and patented pharmaceuticals are not covered under the deal, it would have an impact not just on those companies, but may potentially squeeze margins for contract development and manufacturing organisations (CDMOs) which rely on them, offering R&D and manufacturing services for these companies. Analysts say despite Trump's push to boost local manufacturing, it's not easy to shift manufacturing to the US and get the plants rolling out drugs immediately. It can take 3–5 years or more to plan, construct, validate, and get regulatory approval for a new plant. It requires equipment procurement, workforce training, and supply chain setup."

Waaree Energies shares plunge 8% on US probe over suspected solar tariff evasion,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/waaree-energies-shares-plunge-6-on-us-probe-over-suspected-solar-tariff-evasion-13581954.html,"The shares of Waaree Energies dropped around 8 percent on September 26 after US customs officials said that they were investigating the Indian company over suspected tariff evasion. The shares hit an intraday low of Rs 3,198 apiece on Friday. All about US' tariff evasion probe: US customs officials cited by Reuters said they were investigating if the Indian solar company sidestepped US tariffs on Chinese-made cells and panels by labeling them as 'Made in India'. The American Alliance for Solar Manufacturing Trade Committee, a coalition of domestic solar manufacturers, had requested the investigation in letters to the agency earlier this year. The customs official informed attorneys for Waaree Energies and the coalition about the probe. In its memo quoted by Reuters, the agency said that there was reasonable suspicion that Waaree Energies didn’t label some of its imported products, which are subject to antidumping and countervailing duties imposed for years by America on solar cells and panels made in China and other Asian nations. It said it was taking steps to protect US revenues, such as requiring cash deposits from the company while the investigation is ongoing. What is the American Alliance for Solar Manufacturing Trade Committee? The American Alliance for Solar Manufacturing Trade Committee, which includes leading American solar module manufacturers like Qcells and First Solar, welcomed the probe. “Indian solar products have been among the lowest prices in the market, and now we know why that's possible: by using Chinese cells and not paying the duties that apply to them,"" Tim Brightbill, the group's attorney, said in a statement. ""Waaree has in the past co-operated with the US investigations and will continue to co-operate in ongoing investigations. We are a responsible corporate citizen in every country we operate in and we abide by all applicable local laws and regulations,"" the company said in an exchange filing. Waaree Energies share price history: Waaree Energies shares have dropped nearly 6 percent in the past five days, but gained more than 35 percent in the past six months. The stock is currently up nearly 15 percent in 2025 so far. Its P/E ratio currently stands at over 43. Yes Securities recently initiated a 'Buy' call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 4,610 apiece. This implies an upside potential of nearly 34 percent from the stock's previous closing price. Waaree Energies financials: The company in July reported an 89 percent increase in consolidated net profit at Rs 745 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2025. Its consolidated net profit was Rs 394 crore in the year-ago period. The firm's revenue from operations rose 30 percent to Rs 4,426 crore in Q1 FY26, as against Rs 3,409 crore in Q1FY25. Waaree Energies US operations: Waaree Energies has notable amount of operations in US. Earlier this year, the company had announced that it has started commercial production of solar modules at its manufacturing facility in US, becoming the first Indian renewable energy company to build a PV module manufacturing facility in Brookshire, Texas.

"Small, midcap indices extend losses to 5th straight day mirroring benchmarks; Waaree Energies, Natco Pharma decline up to 6%",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/nifty-small-midcap-indices-extend-losses-to-5th-straight-day-mirroring-benchmarks-waaree-energies-natco-pharma-decline-up-to-6-13581789.html,"The Nifty smallcap100 and midcap100 indices extended their losses for the fifth straight session on Friday, tracking weakness in the benchmark indices. The Nifty midcap index has fallen up to 3.2 percent over the past five sessions, while the smallcap gauge has declined around 4 percent. The broader trend mirrored the losses in the benchmark Sensex and Nifty, which have been on a downward run for six consecutive sessions. During this period, the Sensex has shed 2.73 percent, while the Nifty has slipped 2.52 percent. Analysts believe the correction in the Nifty Smallcap, midcap indices may be driven by profit booking and the unwinding of certain long positions. Ruchit Jain, Vice President, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, said ""this downmove just seems to be a correction within an uptrend and hence, it could result in a good opportunity for positional traders and investors. However, from a swing trading perspective it could be a difficult phase and hence one should tighten the risk management on the positions and wait for some signs of reversal."" In the smallcap segment, pharma counters bore the brunt after the US announced a 100 percent tariff on imports of branded or patented drugs from October 1. Only 13 of the 100 stocks on the Nifty Smallcap 100 index were in positive territory. Neuland Laboratories and Natco Pharma fell up to 4 percent in intraday trade. N ArunaGiri, Founder & CEO at TrustLine Holdings, added ""While benchmark indices like the Nifty may not see a decisive breakout soon, selective opportunities continue to emerge in small- and mid-cap stocks. The recent weakness in these segments has opened up attractive entry points for patient investors who focus on quality businesses. This is not a market for chasing the index; it’s a market that rewards thoughtful, selective stock picking in the broader space. We believe that this phase presents a constructive environment for long-term investors, particularly those willing to take a bottom-up approach in identifying fundamentally strong companies in the broader small and mid-cap space."" Pharma stocks fall up to 4% as Trump imposes 100% tariff on branded drugs Among midcaps, Waaree Energies was the top loser, declining up to 6 percent after US customs officials said that they were investigating the Indian company over suspected tariff evasion. Other prominent laggards included Premier Energies, Vodafone Idea, Biocon, Kalyan Jewellers India and Hindustan Zinc, which dropped up to 3 percent.

"Infosys, TechM, other shares fall up to 2% on Accenture's weak outlook: Nifty IT lower for a sixth session",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/infosys-techm-other-shares-fall-up-to-2-on-accenture-s-weak-outlook-nifty-it-lower-for-a-sixth-session-13581782.html,"Shares of leading IT companies were under selling pressure on September 26 after a weak outlook from Accenture dampened investor sentiment, taking the Nifty IT index lower by more than a percent, extending losses for a sixth session in a row. Accenture Expects Slower Growth While announcing results for the fourth quarter of the financial year 2025, consulting firm Accenture Plc said it expects US federal spending cuts on consultants to slow its growth next year, and sees a 1-1.5 percent impact on revenue from a slowdown in US federal business during the year through August 2026. Accenture also said it is laying off some employees as it pivots towards Artificial Intelligence. ""We are exiting, on a compressed timeline, people where reskilling based on our experience is not a viable path for the skills we need,"" Accenture CEO Julie Sweet told analysts during an earnings call. Recently, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) - India's largest IT services company - also announced layoffs of over 12,000 employees on similar grounds. Accenture Q4 Results Despite the grim outlook, Accenture reported better-than-expected results for Q4FY25. The consulting firm reported a revenue of $17.6 billion, higher than Bloomberg's consensus estimate of $17.4 billion. Accenture expects to clock in a revenue growth between 2-5 percent for the full-year 2026, slightly below estimates of 5.3 percent, according to data compiled by LSEG, as quoted by Reuters. Changes to H-1B visa policy are not likely to have a significant impact on Accenture's business, CEO said, adding that only about 5 percent of its US employees are employed on such visas. What Analysts Say Macquarie said the common takeaway from Accenture's announcements is that ""demand recovery is patchy as of now."" Goldman Sachs said that while the FY26 revenue growth expectations remain unchanged, the FY27 growth estimate for Indian IT firms could be at risk if discretionary demand shows no signs of improvement this year. Jefferies added that Accenture's muted growth guidance poses downside risks to consensus expectations of acceleration in growth in FY27 for Indian IT firms. Top IT Losers LTIMindtree (LTIM), Wipro and Infosys shares fell around 2 percent each, while Coforge, Tech Mahindra (TechM), Persistent Systems, HCL Tech and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) shares were down more than 1 percent each. Some of the leading IT stocks are down up to 30 percent in 2025 so far. Trump's Proposal President Donald Trump-led US administration has proposed to scrap the lottery system for H-1B visas and replace it with wage-based selection process. The new proposal by the Department of Homeland Security aims at bringing in ""a weighted selection process that would generally favour the allocation of H-1B visas to higher-skilled and higher-paid aliens, while maintaining the opportunity for employers to secure H-1B workers at all wage levels"". The new process, if finalised, would give more weight to applications by employers who pay high wages if annual requests for the visas exceed the statutory limit of 85,000, the notice said, as cited by Reuters. The move aims to better protect Americans from unfair wage competition from foreign workers. Also Read: Our LIVE blog on stock market updates US to Hike Fresh H-1B Application Fee Trump had recently announced that the US will introduce a $100,000 fee for fresh H-1B visa applications, an unprecedented increase from the earlier fee range of $215-5,000, depending on the company size. This move had earlier sent the IT stocks to a spin, after a brief rise following US Federal Reserve's rate cut. India was the largest beneficiary of H-1B visas last year, accounting for 71 percent of the approvals, while China was a distant second at 11.7 percent, according to US government data cited by Reuters.

Asia’s top defense stock DroneShield soars on military spending,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/asia-s-top-defense-stock-droneshield-soars-on-military-spending-13580802.html,"DroneShield Ltd. shares have nearly quintupled this year, outperforming Asian defense stocks as the Australian drone technology manufacturer rides a global wave of increased military budgets. The stock has jumped 380% in 2025, outpacing regional peers on a Bloomberg gauge focused on defense firms. A string of contract wins with governments in Australia, the US and Europe have boosted its shares, which joined Australia’s benchmark equity index earlier this month. The value of contracts received this year “is evidence of increased levels of consumer demand,” which the company is well placed to meet, said Bell Potter Securities Ltd. analyst Daniel Laing in a note last month. The growth of asymmetric warfare, including drones and counter-drones, is also central to the firm, he added.  Defense stocks have rallied this year as ongoing conflicts and geopolitical tensions have spurred governments to ramp up spending. South Korea’s Hanwha Aerospace Co. has benefited from its experience in producing weapons for defeating Soviet-era systems, while Chinese defense manufacturers rose in the lead up to Beijing’s military parade in early September. DroneShield develops products to ward off drone attacks by tracking and disabling unmanned aircraft systems. Its stock surged in June after securing a package of European contracts worth A$61.6 million ($40.3 million), its largest order ever. The firm also recently won a package of two US Department of Defense contracts totaling A$7.9 million. In August, the company said its first-half revenue more than tripled from a year earlier. It attributed the increase to growth in regions beyond its key US market, including in Europe and the Asia Pacific. Still, some investors are skeptical of the stock’s surge. The firm’s “stretched” fundamentals at its A$3.2 billion market capitalization is one reason to be cautious, said Ben Richards, co-portfolio manager at Seneca Financial Solutions. DroneShield trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of roughly 70 times, a premium to Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index. Additionally, some directors have sold shares in the company during rallies, “which is a warning sign for us,” Richards added."

Here is how financial markets across the globe fared overnight: GIFT Nifty (Down) The GIFT Nifty is trading lower at around 24,896.50, indicating a negative start for the day. Asian Equities (Mixed) Asian stocks retreated after concerns about lofty valuations and mixed signals from Federal Reserve officials on rate cuts stalled a record-breaking rally on Wall Street.  US Equities (Slip) US stocks ended moderately lower on Thursday, with most S&P 500 sectors down as economic data increased uncertainty over the outlook for interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 173.96 points, or 0.38%, to 45,947.32, the S&P 500 lost 33.25 points, or 0.50%, to 6,604.72 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 113.16 points, or 0.50%, to 22,384.70.

"Asian shares decline, Trump tariffs spook pharma",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/asian-stocks-drop-after-wall-street-rally-stalls-13580744.html,"Asian stocks retreated after concerns about lofty valuations and mixed signals from Federal Reserve officials on rate cuts stalled a record-breaking rally on Wall Street. MSCI’s equity gauge for the region fell 0.3% with South Korean stocks leading the losses. That came after the S&P 500 dropped for a third session, the longest slide in a month. Daiichi Sankyo Co. and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. were among the losers after President Donald Trump proposed 100% levy on branded, patented pharma products. The dollar held its gains and the yen edged lower, hovering near the 150-a-dollar level. S&P 500 futures pared earlier gains to trade little changed after Trump announced a 25% tariff on truck imports from Oct. 1. After a $15 trillion rebound in global equities from April’s lows, traders now face a wall of uncertainty as tariff headlines return to weigh on markets. The Fed’s next policy move, a pivotal earnings season, and the threat of a US government shutdown are also weighing on sentiment. Attention now turns to Friday’s inflation report after the strong GDP data complicated the outlook for further easing after last week’s Fed rate cut. “This refreshed threat on pharma has been brought up by Trump several times as a negotiation tool,” said Anna Wu, cross-asset strategist at VanEck Associates Corp. in Sydney. “I expect this to weigh on the health care sector and broader sentiment in global equities, including Asian markets.” Short-end Treasury yields rose Thursday after data showed US gross domestic product grew at the fastest pace in nearly two years. Following the rally, the S&P 500’s 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio recently touched a high of 22.9, a level that this century was exceeded in just two prior instances: the dot-com bust and the pandemic rally in the summer of 2020 when the Fed reduced rates to near zero. “We agree that the economy is strong and growing,” said Chris Zaccarelli at Northlight Asset Management, “but a lot of that good news is already priced in. Where we have our largest concern is with valuations.” Money markets slightly reduced bets on rate cuts after the GDP data, projecting about 40 basis points of Fed reductions before the year is over. Divisions within the Fed over the path of rates added to the uncertainty. Fed Governor Stephen Miran said the US central bank risks damage to the economy by not moving rapidly to lower interest rates, dissenting against the decision to lower rates last week by a quarter percentage point, favoring a half-point cut. “I don’t think the economy is about to crater,” Miran said Thursday on Bloomberg Surveillance. But given the risks, “I would rather act proactively and lower rates as a result ahead of time, rather than wait for some giant catastrophe to occur,” he said. Michelle Bowman, the Fed’s top bank cop, said inflation is close enough to the central bank’s target to justify more rate cuts because the job market is weakening. Fed Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee expressed continued concern about tariff-driven inflation and pushed back against any call for “front-loading” multiple rate cuts. His Kansas City counterpart Jeff Schmid signaled the central bank may not need to cut again soon. Fed Bank of Dallas President Lorie Logan said the US central bank should abandon the federal funds rate as its benchmark in implementing monetary policy, and consider an overnight rate tied to the more robust market for loans collateralized by US Treasuries. Investors will turn their focus to Friday’s inflation data. The Fed’s preferred gauge of underlying inflation likely grew at a slower pace last month, offering policymakers some breathing room to address jobs cooling. A report on Friday is forecast to show the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy rose 0.2% in August, compared with 0.3% in July. On an annual basis, the so-called core measure is seen holding at a still-elevated 2.9%."

"IT stocks fall for fifth day on US visa curbs; TCS, HCLTech, Wipro decline up to 2.5%",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/it-stocks-fall-for-fifth-day-on-us-visa-curbs-tcs-hcltech-wipro-decline-up-to-2-5-13578900.html,"The shares of IT companies extended losses as investors weighed the impact of US President Donald Trump-led administration's recent announcements on H-1B visa. The sharp fall in the share prices pushed the Nifty IT index down 1.25 percent to 34,557, as seen at 2.50 pm. The index has now fallen more than 6 percent over five consecutive sessions of recording losses so far. Top IT losers today: The shares of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) were the top losers on the index, falling more than 2.5 percent to hit a 52-week low of Rs 2,956.90 apiece. Persistent Systems and HCL Tech shares fell nearly 2 percent each, while Wipro and Coforge shares were down more than 1 percent each. Infosys, Mphasis and Tech Mahindra shares fell nearly 1 percent, while LTIMindtree shares were trading in the red with marginal losses. What has Trump administration proposed? President Donald Trump-led US administration has proposed to scrap the lottery system and replace it with wage-based selection process for allotting H-1B visas. The new proposal by the Department of Homeland Security aims at bringing in ""a weighted selection process that would generally favour the allocation of H-1B visas to higher-skilled and higher-paid aliens, while maintaining the opportunity for employers to secure H-1B workers at all wage levels"". The new process, if finalised, would give heavier weight to applications by employers who pay high wages if annual requests for the visas exceed the statutory limit of 85,000, the notice said as quoted by Reuters. The move aims to better protect Americans from unfair wage competition from foreign workers, it said. US to hike fee for fresh H-1B visa applications: This comes after Trump recently announced that the US will introduce a $100,000 fee for fresh H-1B visa applications, an unprecedented increase from the earlier fee range of $215-$5,000, depending on the company size. This move had earlier sent the IT stocks to a spin, after a brief rise following US Federal Reserve's rate cut. Notably, India was the largest beneficiary of H-1B visas last year, accounting for 71 percent of the approved beneficiaries, while China was a distant second at 11.7 percent, according to government data cited by Reuters. What analysts say? The proposal to scrap the lottery system and introduce wage-based selection process could hurt fresher hiring particularly, with startups and Indian IT firms seen as most impacted, says ICICI Securities. The brokerage believes Indian IT companies will partially mitigate it through offshore hiring, local hiring and near shoring. ""IT companies have reduced their dependence on H-1B visas in recent years via local hiring and nearshoring, and the moderation in fresh H-1B visas is a testimony to this. Expect further downtrend from CY25 base in the coming years, in our view.

"HAL, BEL, other defence shares rise up to 3% on European boost after Trump’s Ukraine remarks, other triggers",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/hal-bel-other-defence-shares-rise-up-to-3-on-european-boost-after-trump-s-ukraine-remarks-other-triggers-13577857.html,"Shares of defence companies rose up to 3 percent on Thursday, tracking gains in European defence stocks after US President Donald Trump voiced support for Ukraine’s efforts to reclaim all of its lost territory. The trigger was Trump’s striking change of tone on Ukraine. Speaking on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, where he met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Trump said Kyiv could recapture its original borders with backing from Europe and NATO. This led to sharp rally in many of the defence stocks in Europe, including Saab, Hensoldt, MilDef among others. Many defence firms in India have existing supply partnerships with European defence companies, making them potential beneficiaries of European rearmament. Moreover, the Indian defence exports have grown rapidly, with Europe emerging as a key destination. The Nifty Defence index ended a three-session losing streak and rose 1.6 percent. Gains were led by Cochin Shipyard, Mazagon Dock and Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers (GRSE), with 13 of the 18 constituents trading in the green. Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL), Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL) and other defence stocks also advanced. HAL was up more than 1 percent, rebounding after three straight sessions of losses. The stock rose after the Ministry of Defence signed a contract with the company for 97 Tejas Mark-1A fighter jets, valued at around Rs 67,000 crore. Additionally, shipping stocks rallied after the Union Cabinet approved a Rs 69,725 crore package to revive India’s shipbuilding industry. Shares of Shipping Corporation of India, Cochin Shipyard, Mazagon Dock and GRSE climbed up to 4 percent. The Cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, also extended the Shipbuilding Financial Assistance Scheme till March 31, 2036, with a corpus of Rs 24,736 crore. Officials said the measures are aimed at reducing reliance on foreign carriers and strengthening India’s maritime capabilities.

We believe Metro Brands is well-positioned to capture these demand tailwinds, supported by 1) strong brand positioning with Metro, Mochi and Crocs in the premium footwear. 2) expected growth pick-up in FILA as it is all set to open EBO’s as design inventory for a refreshed portfolio builds up. 3) Scalability in Foot Locker as a premium format in athleisure with steady addition in number of stores in Tier-1 cities 4) Clark’s acquisition is on track with good initial response given consumer awareness about the brand. Outlook We estimate 18.4% EPS CAGR over FY25–FY28 and assign DCF based TP of Rs1302 with implied PE of 60.3x on Mar’28 at TP (Rs1135 earlier).

Moneycontrol had reported on September 24 citing sources that the promoter and promoter group is targetting a block trade to offload a minority stake of around 0.8 percent to raise around $100 million, or Rs 887 crore. The trade data reported by Bloomberg has pegged the block size at nearly Rs 1,695 crore, nearly double of what was previously cited. Block Trade A person familiar with the matter had told Moneycontrol that the floor price for the transaction was set at Rs 7,300 per share, which is at a discount of over 3 percent to the previous day's closing price. Another person said investment bank Jefferies is acting as the advisor on the proposed transaction. Moneycontrol also learnt that the promoter group will observe a 90-day lock-up on any further share sale following the block trade. Polycab India Shareholding The company's latest shareholding pattern showed that promoters and promoter group held nearly 63 percent stake in Polycab as on June 30, 2025, with the remaining 37 percent held by public. Among the promoters, the largest stake was held by company's Managing Director Inder Jaisinghani, with family members Ajay Jaisinghani, Ramesh Jaisinghani and Girdhari Thakurdas Jaisinghani held nearly 10 percent, 9 percent and 8.5 percent stake respectively, in the company.

The key takeaways are as follows: Pantaloons is focusing on revamping its retail identity while focusing on improving margins by ~300bp over the next five years through improved SSSG and higher own-brand salience. The value retail format OWND! is breaking even on the store level and would be scaled up to 100 stores by the end of FY26, with an accelerated ramp-up from FY27. Designer-led ethnic brands are highly profitable (~20%+ margin). ABFRL’s target is to increase revenue contribution to ~INR20b from ~INR8b over the next few years, with further margin improvement to ~25%. The store rationalization and old inventory clearance in TCNS are largely behind, with store additions likely from 2HFY26. Management expects losses to reduce by ~50% in TCNS in FY26, with break-even targeted in FY27. Outlook We reiterate our Neutral rating on ABFRL with a revised TP of INR100, as we await improvement in execution towards consistent growth and sustained profitability before we turn more constructive on the stock.

Leasing revenue is expected to surge five times to $8 billion, driven by rising internet traffic, growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and stricter data localisation mandates. Rising Capacity and Investment Surge A recent Kotak Institutional Equities report added to this optimism, forecasting India’s data centre market to quadruple by FY28, attracting $20-25 billion in fresh investments. Kotak said data centres may account for 4-5% of India’s total power capacity by FY30, creating tailwinds for renewable energy producers and grid infrastructure. It has projected a 25% CAGR in demand for specialised real estate, with Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad and Pune emerging as key growth corridors due to their submarine cable access and supportive state policies. The data centre boom is creating downstream opportunities across multiple sectors, including real estate ($6 billion), electrical and power systems ($10 billion), racks and fit-outs ($7 billion), cooling systems ($4 billion), and network infrastructure ($1 billion).

Bharti Airtel’s 15% market share, strong free cash flow and established enterprise client relationships position it well to capture this opportunity, according to Jefferies. Demand Fuelled by Digital Growth and AI The brokerage also noted that the surge in data traffic - 30x since FY17 - driven by internet and smartphone adoption, OTT platforms, digital payments and e-commerce, has fuelled demand for data centres. AI adoption is expected to further boost demand as AI servers require 5-6 times more power and liquid cooling than standard servers. Mumbai and Chennai, with proximity to sub-sea cable landing stations, account for 70% of colocation capacity, while top players dominate 90% of the market. Incremental capacity is expected to be led by AdaniConneX and Reliance Industries, the note said. Read More Diversify Across the Ecosystem So how should investors position themselves to capture this theme? Market expert Sunil Subramaniam told Moneycontrol that the key for investors is diversification across the ecosystem. “Don’t try to pick individual winners. Invest across the sector. Buy the story, diversify across telecom, power, infrastructure, and real estate, and ensure your portfolio captures the manifold benefits of this growth theme.” Read More: Data centre boom - $20-25 billion investment to take capacity to 4,500 MW by 2030 Opportunities Beyond Operators A Balasubramaniam, Managing Director and CEO of Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC too underscored the importance of looking beyond just data centre operators. “One of the sectors directly related to data centres is real estate. Second is power and third is the technology providers. All three form part of this opportunity, and they’re being captured by large companies with a focused push into data centres. A big beneficiary will be the power sector, because uninterrupted, high-voltage supply is critical for data centres to operate at speed without disruptions,” said ABSL’s CEO. Vinit Bolinjkar, Head of Research at Ventura Securities added a global perspective. “With India’s data centre capacity set to triple by 2030, backed by $25+ billion in investments, rapid AI adoption, and digitalisation, opportunities extend beyond traditional realty and infra, investors can gain exposure through companies like Anant Raj, Netweb Technologies, Black Box, L&T, and others such as E2E Networks, Tata Communications, and Adani Enterprises. In this capital-intensive sector, value creation hinges on business leverage, execution, and tenancy ramp-up, not just thematic positioning.” As the demand for data centres looks poised to grow exponentially, investors looking to ride the next big theme in India would do well to consider a diversified portfolio across this high-growth ecosystem, from renewable energy and power infrastructure to specialised real estate, telecom, and technology providers.

Tata Motors down 3 percent on fears that cyberattack hit may exceed JLR's FY25 profit,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/tata-motors-is-top-nifty-loser-on-feared-euro-2-billion-hit-from-recent-jlr-cyberattack-exceeding-fy25-profit-13577230.html,"Shares of Tata Motors were lower by over 3 percent in early trade on September 25, emerging as the top Nifty 50 and F&O loser after a report by the Financial Times said that subsidiary JLR may face a Euro 2 billion hit as it was not insured against a recent cyberattack that disrupted operations. The Financial Times report indicated that the hit on JLR could be higher than its entire profit of the previous fiscal. News agency Reuters quoted The Insurer, which cited cyber insurance market sources that the JLR had failed to finalise a cyber insurance deal - brokered by Lockton - leaving it likely uninsured for the attack. JLR has not yet commented on the reports. JLR UK Closure Jaguar Land Rover is extending factory closure until October 1 following a cyberattack in late August. ""We are working at pace to resolve global IT issues impacting our business. We will provide an update as appropriate in due course,"" Tata Motors had said on September 1. ""We have made this decision to give clarity for the coming week as we build the timeline for the phased restart of our operations and continue our investigation,"" JLR said on September 23. JLR has three factories in Britain, at Solihull, Halewood and Wolverhampton, which together manufacture about 1,000 cars per day. The company is losing £50 million ($68 million) every week, as per some news reports. Why JLR Matters During FY25, Jaguar Land Rover contributed 72 percent to Tata Motors' total automotive revenue, higher than its contributing in FY24, reflecting a higher growth trajectory of Jaguar Land Rover as compared to the Tata vehicles. Jaguar Land Rover's revenue increased in FY25 on account of better performance in North America markets. The employee costs at Jaguar Land Rover rose by 15.6 percent to Rs 36,887 crore (£3,417 million) in FY25 due to rise in headcount and annual increments. Cyberattack Fallout The situation has led to British business minister Peter Kyle and industry minister Chris McDonald visit JLR earlier this week to speak to the CEO about the impact. As of June, more than four in ten businesses in UK have had some form of cyber breach over the past one year, according to data cited by Reuters. “I fully recognise the anxiety and deep concern that employees at Jaguar Land Rover and across the supply chain will be feeling. The government and the National Cyber Security Centre will do everything in our power to help resolve this as soon as possible,” UK's Business and Trade minister Chris Bryant told the House of Commons last week. According to PTI News, a group calling itself 'Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters' is believed to have claimed responsibility for the hack. Setback for Tata Motors The cyberattack has led to disruptions at a time when Tata Motors has been seeing increased festive demand in India following the GST rate cuts.  Tata Motors said it recorded 10,000 car deliveries and over 25,000 enquiries on the first day of Navaratri, marking a strong start to the festive season."

"Alibaba, Nvidia show market is instantly rewarding AI spending",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/alibaba-nvidia-show-market-is-instantly-rewarding-ai-spending-13576314.html,"The euphoria toward artificial intelligence is creating a strange kind of new math in the stock market: Plans for massive AI investments often lead to even larger increases in market value for the companies writing the checks. Take Nvidia Corp., which last week said it will buy a $5 billion stake in rival Intel Corp. and on Monday announced plans to invest up to $100 billion in ChatGPT creator OpenAI. The chipmaker added more than $320 billion in market value in the three trading days when the plans were announced — triple the amount the company is expected to spend under both agreements. Then on Wednesday, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s US shares jumped as much as 10% after the company said it would spend even more on AI than a $50 billion target set earlier in the year. While the total amount of additional anticipated spending wasn’t even announced, the news swelled Alibaba’s market capitalization by more than $35 billion. While massive corporate spending plans typically haven’t tended to be instantly rewarded in the stock market, these moves highlight that investors are still clamoring for all things AI and they are happy to keep piling into shares of companies spending big on data centers to position themselves as leaders in the space. The massive increases in market value come even as only a few companies have been able to show a material return on the investment in their financials. “The market is convinced that leadership in AI is going to take a lot of investment,” said Tejas Dessai, director of thematic research at Global X Management Company LLC. “And the market is also convinced that there are profits that can be earned out of this opportunity as long as you have the scale and the infrastructure to really service all this demand.”  Other stocks that’ve seen a lift this year after pledging to spend more than $317 billion combined on AI include Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp, Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., whose gains account for a major part of the S&P 500 Index’s rally in 2025. The amount of value added to the companies this year far outstrips how much the group intends to spend: The four together have seen their market capitalization boosted by about $1.8 trillion. Oracle Corp. is another beneficiary of plans to boost spending on AI alongside high-profile partnerships with the likes of OpenAI, SoftBank Group Corp. and Meta Platforms as well as solid earnings outlooks that’ve charmed investors. The company is expected to spend $35 billion on capital expenditures in fiscal year 2026, and increase that amount to $65 billion by fiscal 2029. The stock has risen by more than 80% this year, adding nearly $390 billion to its market value. The market enthusiasm toward data-center builds comes despite mounting concerns that recent deals, such as the one between Nvidia and OpenAI, potentially signal a bubble due to the circular nature of the agreements: Nvidia is essentially investing in its customers. And with the biggest technology stocks making up a larger portion of the market than ever, the increased concentration risk could mean any downside pressure on them could spark a nasty move lower in benchmark indexes. Read More: Big Tech’s Market Dominance Stirs Debate on Concentration Risks “We are clearly in uncharted waters,” Louis Navellier, chief investment officer of Navellier & Associates, wrote in a Wednesday note to clients describing the concentration risk and the fact that the value of the US stock market is now more than double the size of the nation’s economy. ‘Bubble Environment’ The movement in Nvidia’s stock especially is “atypical market behavior that is representative of the bubble environment,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading, adding that the company’s $4.3 trillion market capitalization means that even small moves in shares constitute billions of dollars in value gained or lost. Still, bubble or not, many on Wall Street believe that the trend is likely to continue, at least in the near future. Investors have made it clear they have appetite for AI ambitions and the companies that are willing to spend big as an arms race of sorts emerges. While technological infrastructure investment has drawn skepticism in the past due to unfavorable outcomes such as the bursting of the dot-com bubble, there’s more support today for innovations that have already proven to be transformational. “The market has been super friendly to allow these companies to go on this investment spree, which again ties back to the story that the market really believes that AI presents a foundational opportunity not only for these companies but for the broader economy,” Global X’s Dessai said. “The biggest risk right now is underspending, especially if you are a category leader.”"
Asian stocks dip after Wall Street rally stalls,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/asian-stocks-in-tight-range-as-global-rally-stalls-13576290.html,"Asian stocks slipped after losses on Wall Street as signs of fatigue crept into the AI-fueled equity rally. The Nikkei-225 index fell 0.2% with losses in Australia and Taiwan. The S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 and a gauge of global stocks all dropped for a second consecutive day Wednesday. A gauge of the dollar gave up some of its gains from the prior session while oil steadied following its biggest jump since July. Treasury yields were little changed after rising across the curve in US trading. An index of US-listed Chinese companies rallied against the downcast mood on Wall Street to climb 2.8%, with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. jumping 8.2%. Equity-index futures for Hong Kong retreated as the city returns to normalcy after Super Typhoon Ragasa. Insurance claims from the typhoon can be $50 million to $100 million, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Investors in Asia will also focus on the sale of 40-year Japanese government bonds Thursday. The retreat on Wall Street signaled a breather for an AI-driven surge that has already lifted the S&P 500 about 12% this year as investors rushed to names like Nvidia Corp. That momentum appeared to dissipate Wednesday as traders awaited fresh catalysts amid risks stemming from a labor-market slowdown to sticky inflation. “Timeout called,” said Craig Johnson at Piper Sandler. “The trend of strong gains isn’t over yet. However, the short-term risk-reward profile is becoming more compressed as stocks extend higher while underlying momentum fades.” Policy risks were also weighing on markets. The administration launched investigations into imports of robotics, industrial machinery and medical devices, a sign President Donald Trump may expand his tariff regime. South Korea’s prime minister warned that major investment projects in the US will stall until visa issues are resolved, urging Washington to reassure Koreans worried about detentions. Elsewhere, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President Mary Daly said further interest-rate cuts are likely needed, but the US central bank should approach those with caution. While the S&P 500 has defied September’s gloomy reputation as the worst month for equity returns, the gauge failed to gain traction on Wednesday, sparking concerns the rally has hit an air pocket. At Bank of America Corp., Savita Subramanian noted that on 19 of 20 metrics, the US equity benchmark is trading at statistically expensive levels. “In theory, investors pay up for predictable assets and are compensated for uncertainty. Perhaps we should anchor to today’s multiples as the ‘new normal’ rather than expecting mean reversion to a bygone era,” Subramanian at BofA said in a note. In commodities, copper prices soared after Freeport-McMoRan Inc. said force majeure was declared on contracted supplies from its giant Grasberg mine in Indonesia. Gold fell 0.7% Wednesday as oil climbed for a second day."
