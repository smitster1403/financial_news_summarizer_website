Yes Bank shares gain 2% as CCI clears Sumitomo Mitsui’s 25% stake acquisition,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/yes-bank-shares-gain-2-as-cci-clears-sumitomo-mitsui-s-25-stake-acquisition-13515190.html,"Shares of Yes Bank jumped 2 percent to Rs 20 on September 3 after the Competition Commission of India (CCI) cleared Japan’s Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation’s (SMBC) proposal to acquire up to 24.99 percent stake in the private lender. “The proposed combination relates to the acquisition of share capital and voting rights of Yes Bank by Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation,” the CCI said in its release. SMBC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (SMFG), Japan’s second-largest banking group with total assets of $2 trillion as of December 2024 and a significant global presence. This approval comes close on the heels of the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) nod last month for SMBC’s plan to acquire up to 24.99 percent of Yes Bank’s paid-up capital and voting rights. The transaction traces back to Yes Bank’s May 9, 2025, disclosure that SMBC would purchase a 20 percent stake via a secondary deal, comprising 13.19 percent from State Bank of India (SBI) and 6.81 percent collectively from seven other banks including Axis Bank, Bandhan Bank, Federal Bank, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, IDFC First Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank. Following this deal, SMBC will emerge as the single-largest shareholder in Yes Bank. Separately, the RBI has also approved the re-appointment of Rama Subramaniam Gandhi as part-time Chairman of Yes Bank from September 20, 2025, until May 13, 2027. Gandhi, a seasoned central banker with 37 years of service, earlier served as RBI Deputy Governor between 2014 and 2017.

"Indus Towers sinks 4% on foray into African markets, dividend concerns weigh",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/indus-towers-shares-in-focus-on-foray-into-african-markets-brokerages-remain-bullish-13514718.html,"Shares of telecommunications company Indus Towers Ltd sank four percent in trade on Wednesday, September 3, after the firm's board gave its nod for a foray into the African markets, which will mark the first-ever overseas expansion of Indus Towers. The company has received approval to foray in African markets, beginning with Nigeria, Uganda, and Zambia as these markets offer attractive prospects for revenue diversification, operational scalability, and long-term value creation, the firm said in a statement. ""Indus Towers will leverage its robust financial position and anchor customer relationship with Bharti Airtel to establish a strong and competitive presence in these regions. As part of its broader growth strategy, the company will continue to evaluate expansion opportunities in other African markets where Airtel has an established presence,"" the statement said. Brokerages reaffirmed their bullishness, highlighting Indus Towers' attractive valuations. Citi maintained a buy rating on Indus Towers with a target price of Rs 460, noting that investor concerns over delayed payouts, Vi’s financial health, and Bharti’s slower rollouts are overstated. The brokerage highlighted the potential for medium-term growth, strong free cash flow generation, and moderating capex intensity, which could support higher shareholder returns. Citi added that valuations remain attractive versus peers, with its bear-case scenario indicating limited downside risk. CLSA retained its high conviction outperform call on Indus Towers with a target of Rs 520, pointing to the board’s approval for an international foray beginning with Nigeria, Uganda, and Zambia. However, with fewer than 500 towers in these markets, revenue diversification is expected to remain limited. Instead, the brokerage expects management to prioritize capital structure improvement through higher dividends. CLSA flagged the ongoing delay in distributions as unjustified despite the board’s commitment to reinstating payouts. Indus Towers has not declared any dividend since May 2022, citing pending dues from its major client Vodafone Idea. Earlier this year, the company was expected to consider a bonus issue, share buyback, or both at its May board meeting. However, the meeting was postponed, which weighed on investor sentiment and pulled the stock lower. At 9.18 a.m., shares were quoting Rs 315.95, lower by 4.1 percent on the NSE compared to the previous session's closing price.

Asian stocks poised to track Wall Street declines,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/asian-stocks-poised-to-track-wall-street-declines-13514178.html,"Asian stocks were poised to mirror a weak US session, where equities fell alongside bonds amid a rush of corporate-debt sales and worries over developed-world budgets. Equity-index futures pointed to a weaker open in Japan and Australia and a tepid open for Hong Kong. Earlier, the S&P 500 pared losses to close 0.7% lower. US contracts edged 0.2% higher in early Asia trading. Alphabet Inc. gained in after-hours trading as a federal judge ruled Google won’t be forced to sell its Chrome browser. US 30-year bond yields neared 5% on Tuesday, weighing on tech shares whose valuations had stretched during a surge from April lows. The dollar rose and gold climbed to a record. The yen weakened after a report said Japan’s ruling party is set to call for early party elections. Traders are contending with a range of concerns, from key economic data and US tariffs to Federal Reserve independence, monetary policy and global fiscal prospects. This comes as the stock market appears to be at a crossroads, with the S&P 500 having logged its smallest monthly gain since July 2024, just before what is historically the weakest month for equities. Along with a slew of corporate sales, there’s been renewed concern about longer-dated global debt after years of issuance exacerbated budget deficits. In the UK, the yield on long-dated bonds hit the highest since 1998 and the pound sank as pressure mounted on Prime Minister Keir Starmer to manage the budget. Long bonds are under real pressure from poor deficit and debt metrics in many countries and, in the US, from Fed-related concerns, according to Nomura. “A breach of 5% on the US 30-year will likely further increase the focus on these issues,” said Andrew Ticehurst, a Nomura Holdings Inc. strategist in Sydney. In Asia, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. will be in focus after the US revoked the company’s authorization to freely ship essential gear to its main Chinese chipmaking base. TSMC’s US-listed American depositary receipts slipped as much as 2.3% Tuesday. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump said his administration would ask the Supreme Court for an expedited ruling in hopes of overturning a federal court decision that many of his tariffs were illegally imposed. “The stock market’s down because the stock market needs the tariffs. They want the tariffs,” the president said. Traders will be looking to key US labor market data this week for clues on economic growth and the Fed’s policy outlook. Employers showed little enthusiasm to take on workers during August, and the unemployment rate probably ticked up to an almost four-year high, adding to evidence of a more subdued jobs market. The importance of this week’s economic data will ultimately drive where yields are by Friday’s close – even if there is a lot that could shift investors’ perception of the state of the labor market in the interim,” said Ian Lyngen and Vail Hartman at BMO Capital Markets. On the economic front, US factory activity shrank in August for a sixth straight month, driven by a pullback in production that shows manufacturing remains bogged down by higher import duties. “The ISM manufacturing report indicated that companies are largely managing headcount rather than actively hiring,” said Scott Helfstein at Global X. “This may be a clue ahead of Friday’s jobs numbers. New jobs are likely slowing, but meaningful revisions to data over the prior months could mean that the report, good or bad, may not influence investors much.” Helfstein said investors should pay close attention to wage growth in Friday’s job report. “Wages have been outpacing inflation and that is usually a good sign for consumption,” he said. “While defaults are going up slightly, most of the numbers on consumer behavior have remained robust.”"
BSE SME IPO Index loses steam in 2025 after four-year surge,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ipo/bse-sme-ipo-index-loses-steam-in-2025-after-four-year-surge-13513855.html,"After four years of spectacular gains, the BSE SME IPO Index has lost momentum in 2025, slipping nearly six percent so far. The reversal comes on the heels of a remarkable rally that saw the index surge 1,100 percent in 2021, climb 43 percent in 2022, advance 96 percent in 2023, and jump another 147 percent in 2024. This year, however, volatility has returned. The index, which touched a record 1,22,298 in early January, now trades about 12 percent below its peak.  According to SVenkat, Founder and Chief Growth Officer at Practus, the marginal decline is within historical ranges. “Volatility is natural in this segment, but the strong pipeline of issues shows both demand from investors and supply from enterprises remain robust,” he said. Market participants attribute the turbulence to the frenetic rally of recent years, when many companies listed at premiums of more than 90 percent despite weak fundamentals. Retail exuberance, driven by fear of missing out, pushed several counters to dizzying heights before they collapsed. Teerth Gopicon is a stark example: listed in 2024 at Rs 111, it soared to Rs 774 before slumping to Rs 88—about 20 percent below its issue price. Analysts note that investors are now steering clear of smaller firms without a proven track record, especially in an uncertain macroeconomic environment. The lack of quarterly disclosures—SMEs publish results only twice a year—has compounded the problem, leaving investors with fewer data points to build conviction. Weak governance, fragile business models, and an oversupply of IPOs have further weighed on the segment. Despite the setbacks, activity in the SME IPO market remains brisk. In 2025 so far, 154 issues have raised Rs 6,800 crore, compared with 240 issues in 2024 that mobilised Rs 8,760 crore. However, listing-day gains have been far more subdued this year. Of the 154 IPOs, around 50 listed below their issue price, 55 delivered single-digit returns, while 49 rewarded investors with sharp gains. By contrast, in 2024, 73 SMEs doubled on debut and 120 logged gains between 10 and 90 percent. The top performers in 2025 include Indobell Insulations, Avax Apparels & Ornaments, Sawaliya Foods Products, and Fabtech Technologies Cleanrooms, each delivering listing gains of over 90 percent. On the flip side, Arunaya Organics slumped 45 percent on debut, while Jainik Power Cables, Mahendra Realtors & Infrastructure, Essex Marine, Marc Loire Fashions, Valencia India, Supertech EV, and Infonative Solutions fell about 24 percent on listing. Some analysts argue that the recent swings are not alarming, pointing out that volatility is inherent to SME counters. They stress that while these stocks carry elevated risk, they also offer outsized reward, and investors are gradually adjusting to this trade-off. “The steady stream of fund-raising underscores the growing importance of the SME platform, even as geopolitical uncertainty adds to market choppiness,” said Vipul Bhowar, Senior Director and Head of Equities at Waterfield Advisors. “The momentum of SME IPOs shows little sign of slowing.” Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Godrej Consumer Products, Sobha, Jindal Steel, Britannia Industries, Manappuram Finance, and others on September 03?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-godrej-consumer-products-sobha-jindal-steel-britannia-industries-manappuram-finance-and-others-on-september-03-13514163.html,"Equity benchmarks saw profit booking at higher levels and closed the session with moderate losses on September 2, but the market breadth was dominated by bulls. A total of 1,737 shares gained against 1,043 shares that saw correction on the NSE. The consolidation is expected to continue as long as the frontline indices trade below short-term moving averages. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Amol Athawale, VP Technical Research at Kotak Securities Godrej Consumer Products | CMP: Rs 1,283.8  Godrej Consumer Products has given a breakout of its symmetrical triangle chart pattern with a bullish candlestick formation, along with incremental volume activity. Additionally, on daily and weekly charts, it has formed a higher bottom series; therefore, the structure of the stock indicates further bullish momentum in the coming horizon. Unless it is trading below Rs 1,240, positional traders can retain an optimistic stance and look for a target of Rs 1,380. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,380 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,240 Jindal Steel & Power | CMP: Rs 975.15  On the daily charts, Jindal Steel & Power is in a rising channel chart formation with a higher high and higher low series pattern. The counter witnessed a steady recovery from trendline support levels. Additionally, the technical indicator RSI is also indicating a further uptrend from current levels, which could boost bullish momentum in the near future. For positional traders, Rs 940 would be the decisive level. Trading above the same, the uptrend formation will continue till Rs 1,040. However, if it closes below Rs 940, traders may prefer to exit long positions. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,040 Stop-Loss: Rs 940 Sobha | CMP: Rs 1,460.2  On a daily timeframe, Sobha had been in a downtrend. Therefore, it is currently in an oversold territory and available near its demand area. The texture of the chart formation and technical indicator RSI indicate that the stock is very likely to rebound for a new leg of the up move from its demand zone. For the next few trading sessions, Rs 1,405 could be the trend-decider level for the bulls. If it sustains above the same, we can expect further uptrend towards Rs 1,560. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,560 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,405 Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors Britannia Industries | CMP: Rs 5,891.5  The FMCG sector continued to outshine post the announcement of GST 2.0, in which Britannia is one of the top performers. In the previous session, the stock managed to close in green despite major indices falling, and now it is trading on the edge of giving a breakout of the rounding bottom pattern on the daily chart. Also, prices have been protecting the prior day’s low on a closing basis for the past 6 trading sessions, indicating consistent buying.

"M&M, Tata Motors shares fall up to 2% amid buzz of GST hike on EVs priced from Rs 20-40 lakh",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/m-m-tata-motors-shares-fall-up-to-2-amid-buzz-of-gst-hike-on-evs-priced-from-rs-20-40-lakh-13512136.html,"The shares of Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) and Tata Motors dropped sharply in afternoon trade after a report said that an Indian tax panel has proposed to hike GST on some electric cars from the existing 5 percent to 18 percent. M&M shares dropped more than 2 percent to trade at Rs 3,247 apiece, emerging as the top loser on the Nifty 50 index. Tata Motors shares were down nearly 1 percent to trade at Rs 685 apiece. The Indian tax panel has proposed to increase the GST rate to 18 percent from the current 5 percent for EVs priced between Rs 20 lakh and Rs 40 lakh, Reuters reported. For cars priced above Rs 40 lakh, the panel has recommended raising the GST rate to 28 percent as such vehicles cater to the ""upper segment"" of the society and are largely imported rather than manufactured domestically, it added. ""The uptake of electric vehicles is increasing and while, the low rate of 5% is to incentivise faster adoption of electric vehicles, it is also important to signal that higher-priced EVs can be taxed at higher rates,"" Reuters quoted a document by the tax panel as saying. The GST Council, which is set to meet between September 3 and September 4, to review prospective GST reforms, already has a proposal to completely do away with the 28 percent GST slab to introduce a simpler tax structure. Hence, the council may increase the tax on EVs to 18 percent or put them in the newly planned 40 percent category planned for certain luxury goods, the report cited a government source as saying. Domestic automakers like Mahindra & Mahindra and Tata Motors have limited offering in the segment which reportedly faces a possible GST hike. If implemented, this will have a stronger impact on the luxury EV makers like Tesla, BYD, Mercedes and BMW, the report added. In July 2025, Tata Motors led the Indian electric car market with nearly 40 percent market share, while M&M held 18 percent share. BYD held a 3 percent market share, while Mercedes and BMW together accounted for 2 percent of the market. Tesla is taking bookings but is yet to start deliveries. The Nifty Auto index dropped 1 percent intraday to its day's low. M&M and Tata Motors shares were among the top losers on the index, along with Tube Investments of India.

Leveraging its moat around marketing, distribution, and consumer-centric innovation, ABLBL has successfully scaled up revenue of each of its multiple brands to >Rs10bn. With a goal of improving profitability, ABLBL has steadily moved away from channels that offer high discounts, along with shelving loss-making businesses (eg Forever 21), thus limiting overall revenue CAGR to a high single-digit in FY20- 25 (vs EBO channel: ~12% revenue CAGR; mix: ~45%). However, portfolio correction is largely done – ABLBL now expects to deliver a high-teen EBITDA CAGR in FY25-30, led by low double-digit topline CAGR and an overall 300bps margin gain. After a cycle of network consolidation in FY25, ABLBL’s asset-light franchisee-led expansion (~70%) is expected to pick up, with ~250pa store adds over FY25-30 (~8% CAGR). We now expect ABLBL’s working capital (WC) to stabilize at ~15% of sales, though better WC execution is a potential upside.

KTAs from our analysis of UTCEM’s FY25 Annual Report: 1) Despite the weak pricing scenario (~7% YoY sharp decline in gray cement realization) in FY25, UTCEM posted a resilient EBITDA margin of ~16.5% (~18% in FY24) and EBITDA/t of Rs960 (Rs1,090 YoY). 2) It added 43mtpa (~30% of FY24 capacity base) in FY25, and is on track to surpass total capacity of 210mtpa by FY27, hence logging a strong ~70-75mtpa lead over Ambuja Cements (consol). 3) Leverage (FY25 net debt-to-EBITDA: 1.4x) in check despite heavy capex. We expect UTCEM to turn net cash by FY27E on the back of healthy cash flow generation and controlled capex. We maintain a positive stance on UTCEM (our top sector-pick) led by 1) healthy pricing environment in FY26TD, 2) visible turnaround in India Cements coupled with a strong EBITDA/t (Rs800 by FY27) guidance, 3) commitment to deliver >Rs300/t (already achieved Rs86/t in FY25) operational cost rationalization. Outlook We believe the likely GST rate-cut could accelerate market share gains in the medium term. We value UTCEM at 19x Jun-28E EV/EBITDA with TP of Rs14,700.

"Nalco, DLF, other metal and real estate stocks rise up to 5%: Fed rate cut hopes, 4 other reasons behind rally",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/nalco-dlf-other-metal-and-real-estate-stocks-rise-up-to-5-fed-rate-cut-hopes-4-other-reasons-behind-rally-13511357.html,"The shares of metal and real estate companies surged on September 2, buoyed by multiple factors. The sharp rise in the share prices pushed the two sectoral indices into the green, leading gains on the market today. The Nifty Metal index rose 1.3 percent to hover around 9,426, and the Nifty Realty index gained 1.33 percent to 891.50, as seen at 12.10 pm. Here are 5 possible triggers for the sharp rise in the stocks: US Fed rate cut hopes: Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on August 22 said that the weak job market may soon force the American central bank to cut interest rates. ""Downside risks to employment are rising,"" according to Powell's remarks at the Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium. Most investors now expect a 25-basis-point Fed rate cut during its upcoming meeting which is scheduled between September 16 and September 17. A rate cut in the US could reduce borrowing costs for foreign investors, encouraging them to invest in higher growth markets in India. This boosts real estate and metal stocks. Additionally, investors expect the RBI to follow Fed in the pursuit of a rate cut, if any. This too can positively impact the stocks. GST reforms: The GST Council, chaired by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, is slated to meet in New Delhi on September 3-4 to deliberate on the Centre's proposal for a simplified two-rate structure of 5 percent and 18 percent. According to market experts, this simplicity in the tax structure will reduce the cost of developers and benefit homebuyers. Pradeep Aggarwal, Founder & Chairman, Signature Global (India) Ltd said that housing sector stands to benefit from these reforms, as moving to a two-slab structure will not only make GST compliance easier for real estate developers, but also help rationalise input costs, improve cash flows and eventually reduce the cost of homes for buyers. Strong Q1 GDP numbers: Indian economy grew 7.8 percent in the April-June quarter of the ongoing financial year. This is the highest growth recorded in five consecutive quarters, beating economists' estimates. Gross domestic product (GDP) topped both the RBI's 6.5 percent projection and the 6.6 percent median recorded in a Moneycontrol poll. The GDP growth was also stronger than the 7.4 percent rate recorded in the preceding three months (Q4 FY25) and 6.5 percent recorded a year earlier (Q1 FY25). The strong GDP numbers may have spurred confidence in Indian economy's growth, which in turn boosted the real estate and metal stocks. Weak dollar: The US dollar is hovering near a multi-month low. Trump's appointments to the Fed are likely to further weigh on the dollar, according to DBS. ""Already, the labour market is softening, and Chair Powell has signalled the possibility of rate cuts at Jackson Hole,"" the analysts wrote. ""This means that the overvalued USD could ease again as markets anticipate coming Fed rate cuts."" A weaker dollar improves global demand for commodities, like metals, which in turn benefits Indian metal companies through higher export opportunities and better pricing. China aims to cut steel output: China aims to cut steel production between 2025 and 2026, according to an official document reviewed by Reuters. The country's move aims to tackle overcapacity that has hit prices significantly. Reduced steel output from China will reduce dumping of cheap metals into the Indian market, which in turn will benefit the Indian metal companies. On the metal index, National Aluminium Company (NALCO) shares gained nearly 5 percent to emerge as the top gainer. NMDC shares followed, rising nearly 4 percent. Hindustan Copper, Steel Authority of India (SAIL), Tata Steel, APL Apollo Tubes, Hindustan Zinc and JSW Steel shares gained up to 3 percent. On the real estate index, Phoenix Mills shares gained 3.5 percent to trade at Rs 1,570 apiece and emerge as the top gainer. Anant Raj and DLF shares jumped up to 3 percent. Godrej Properties, Oberoi Realty and Raymond shares gained nearly 2 percent each. ""Real estate and metal stocks have emerged as notable gainers after facing pressure in earlier months. The combination of infrastructure-led demand growth, record commercial real estate performance, and favourable GST rate cut expectation is presently leading both sectors outperformance,"" said Puneet Singhania, Director at Master Trust Group. GST reforms and rate cuts together can spur growth by lowering compliance costs, improving efficiency, and boosting affordability, said Pranay Aggarwal, Director and CEO of Stoxkart. ""Reduced GST on housing or construction inputs supports real estate demand, while cheaper financing from rate cuts aids both homebuyers and capital-intensive industries like metals. These measures enhance investment, stimulate domestic demand, and strengthen overall market sentiment,"" he added. India’s real estate sector is in a structural upcycle, with housing sales in the top seven cities crossing 180,000 units in H1 2025, the highest in 15 years, said Jickson Sajee Research Analyst, INVasset PMS. ""With private equity inflows exceeding $3.5 billion in H1, the sector is attracting capital, while large, disciplined developers are consolidating market share,"" Sajee added. Indian metal firms are countering through integration, efficiency, and green steel investments, keeping medium-term prospects strong despite near-term volatility, Sajee further said.

Silver's record rally past $40 has rubbed off on shares of key suppliers like Hindustan Zinc,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/silver-s-record-rally-past-40-has-rubbed-off-on-shares-of-key-suppliers-like-hindustan-zinc-13511373.html,"For the first time since 2011, international silver prices are above $40 per ounce, tracking renewed investor interest in precious metals, with the extended run sparking interest in shares of suppliers and clean energy companies. Last month alone, silver prices surged over 10 percent, and the continued rally has rubbed off on the shares of Indian companies engaged in related businesses such as Hindustan Zinc, Vedanta and Goldiam International, anticipating earnings boost from a surge in industrial as well as investor demand. Shares of Hindustan Zinc are higher by around 1.5 percent in trade after a 3.9 percent surge a day before, with Vedanta's shares too sharply off early lows. In the past five trading session, shares of Goldiam International, a jewellery exporter, are higher by over 11 percent. The rally in silver has followed the surge in gold prices, which topped $3,500 per ounce - a record high - on rising hopes of a rate cut by US Federal Reserve, and strong safe haven buying amid global uncertainties. So far this year, silver prices have soared more than 40 percent. Lower borrowing cost in US is expected to benefit precious metals. The recent, sharp weakness in Rupee, testing record low of 88/USD too is likely to benefit major exporters' earnings. Fund flow into silver ETFs too have strengthened recently, with Nippon’s India silver ETF crossing Rs 10,000 crore AUM mark, tracking global momentum and domestic demand projections ahead of the festive season. Globally, silver ETF holdings have grown for a seventh consecutive month in August, the longest run since 2020. One of key beneficiaries, Hindustan Zinc is the world's third largest silver producer with an output of 687 MT of silver in FY25, and a planned target to ramp up capacity to 1500 MT by 2030. The management sees silver prices staying buoyant in the coming quarters, with its precious metal portfolio contributing significantly to the overall profitability. Hindustan Zinc has also announced India’s first zinc tailings reprocessing plant at an investment of Rs 3,823 crore to recover high-value zinc and silver from discarded material."

Buy Phoenix Mills; target of Rs 2044: Motilal Oswal,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-phoenix-mills-target-of-rs-2044-motilal-oswal-13511247.html,"Motilal Oswal's research report on Phoenix Mills During FY15-25, PHNX’s retail portfolio witnessed an 11% CAGR in consumption, supported by ~7% like-for-like growth in the existing malls and the opening of new malls in Lucknow, Indore, Ahmedabad, Pune, and Bengaluru. Additionally, retail rental income clocked a similar 12% CAGR during this period, mirroring the consumption growth. We anticipate this positive growth trend to continue, primarily driven by the ramp-up of new malls. As of 1QFY26, trading occupancy stood at 89%, down from 91% in Mar’25. Flat or declining consumption in certain mature assets is linked to ongoing revamps and tenant churn. In Bengaluru, approximately 10% of the leasable area is currently under fit-outs or being repurposed from hypermarkets to high-performing fashion anchors. Pune is undergoing a similar transformation, replacing outdated anchors and restaurants with newer, more relevant offerings. Management remains optimistic about the long-term performance, projecting strong growth from FY27 onward once the revamps are completed. Outlook We upgrade our rating to BUY with a revised TP of INR2,044 (earlier INR1,673), implying upside potential of 35%.

The brokerage upgraded Sun TV to “buy” from “sell” and significantly raised its price target to Rs 680 for the next 12 months and Rs 840 over the next three years. These targets imply an upside potential of 25 percent in the short term and 54 percent over the long term. Avendus Spark said it now views Sun TV as a fast-growing sports company rather than a stagnating linear TV broadcaster. It highlighted that Sun TV has the highest listed exposure to the Indian Premier League (IPL) among media peers, making it the purest proxy for investors to participate in India’s sports monetisation opportunity. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog The brokerage expects Sun TV’s IPL revenue to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9 to 12 percent between 2025 and 2027, reaching Rs 15,000 crore. Its IPL franchise, Sunrisers Hyderabad, is projected to contribute nearly 60 percent to the company’s sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) valuation. Avendus Spark has applied a 40x price-to-earnings multiple to Sun TV’s IPL business and 10x to its core broadcasting business. In a strategic move to expand its sports portfolio, Sun TV’s board in July approved the acquisition of a 100 percent stake in Northern Superchargers Ltd., a London-based cricket franchise that competes in The Hundred, a professional league run by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB). The deal is valued at £100.5 million (approximately Rs 1,161 crore).

Gold futures have crossed the key Rs 1.05 lakh per 10 grams-mark on MCX. The rising gold prices bodes well for gold financiers, as it increases the value of the collateral while issuing loans. This reduces the risk of default, as the collateral becomes more valuable relative to the loan amount issued against it.

Analyst expect the bull run in gold prices to continue. ""A softer US dollar and renewed safe-haven demand supported the rally, as investors turned to gold amid ongoing uncertainty surrounding US monetary policy. Growing political pressure may accelerate the timeline for interest rate cuts, with markets largely pricing in a 25 bps reduction in September—a development that remains supportive for bullion,"" said Axis Securities. Manav Modi from Motilal Oswal Financial Services also noted that the precious metals were up on safe-haven buying. ""Along with increasing rate cut expectations, tensions between Israel and Gaza and other geo-political tensions and the tariff escalations are continuously supporting buying in bullions, as increased expectations of a U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate cut this month lifted bullion's allure…Increase in festive and wedding demand, ETF buying and Increased premiums in China are some of the additional factors supporting gold’s bull run,"" he added.

"Gokaldas Exports, Avanti Feeds rise up to 7% on US Treasury Secy's 'two great countries will get it solved' remark",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/gokaldas-exports-avanti-feeds-rise-up-to-7-on-us-treasury-secy-s-two-great-countries-will-get-it-solved-remark-13510716.html,"Textile and shrimp stocks surged on September 2 after US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed confidence that Washington and New Delhi can resolve the ongoing trade jitters, hours after Prime Minister Narendra Modi returned from China after attending the SCO Summit. Speaking to Fox News, Bessent said, ""I think at the end of the day, two great countries will get this solved."" He said the slow progress in India-US trade talks was one of the reasons behind US President Donald Trump-led US administration's decision to raise tariffs. He however criticised India's imports of Russian oil, which he said might be fueling Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine. ""The Indians have not been great actors in terms of buying Russian oil and then reselling it, financing the Russian war effort in Ukraine,"" he said. Speaking about Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit, Bessent said it is largely performative. ""I think at the end of the day, India is the most populous democracy in the world. Their values are much closer to ours and to China's than to Russia's,"" he added. Bessent's remarks may have spurred trade talk hopes between India and US, triggering a rally in the export-oriented textile and shrimp stocks. Gokaldas Exports shares jumped nearly 5 percent to trade at Rs 733 apiece, while KPR Mill shares surged nearly 3 percent. Raymond Lifestyle shares gained more than 3 percent, while Arvind Fashions sharers rose nearly 3 percent. Avanti Feeds shares rallied around 7 percent, while Apex Frozen Foods shares jumped more than 4 percent. Notably, these companies derive a major portion of their revenue from US exports. These stocks earlier tumbled after US increased its tariffs on Indian imports to a whopping 50 percent, the highest among its Asian peers. US President Donald Trump recently lashed out at India, calling the relationship between India and US ""a totally one-sided disaster"". In a post on Truth Social, Trump said, ""What few people understand is that we do very little business with India, but they do a tremendous amount of business with us. In other words, they sell us massive amounts of goods, their biggest “client,” but we sell them very little … They have now offered to cut their Tariffs to nothing, but it’s getting late. They should have done so years ago."" Also read: Our LIVE blog on stock market updates"

"Phoenix Mills stock rallies 5% as Motilal Oswal upgrades to buy, sees 35% upside",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/phoenix-mills-stock-rallies-5-as-motilal-oswal-upgrades-to-buy-sees-35-upside-13510372.html,"Shares of mall operator and real estate player The Phoenix Mills rallied nearly five percent in trade on Tuesday, September 2, after domestic brokerage Motilal Oswal upgraded the counter to 'buy,' citing a strong growth outlook. The broking house upgraded its rating on the stock, while hiking its target price to Rs 2,044, which indicated a 35 percent upside from current levels. At 9.55 a.m., shares of the firm were quoting Rs 1,583.7, higher by 4.4 percent. During FY15-25, Phoenix Mills' retail portfolio witnessed an 11 percent CAGR in consumption, supported by ~7 percent like-for-like growth in the existing malls and the opening of new malls in Lucknow, Indore, Ahmedabad, Pune, and Bengaluru. Additionally, retail rental income clocked a similar 12 percent CAGR during this period, mirroring the consumption growth. Going ahead, Motilal Oswal anticipates this positive growth trend to continue, primarily driven by the ramp-up of new malls. The brokerage estimated a 21 percent CAGR in retail rental income over FY25-27E to reach Rs 2,800 crore by FY27E and total income to reach Rs 3,900 crore. While new malls continue to ramp up well, the firm is implementing measures to accelerate consumption at mature malls. These initiatives, along with a further increase in trading occupancy, will help Phoenix Mills sustain healthy traction in consumption. Further, the company continues to diversify and expand its office portfolio within its existing mall properties across key locations. Notable developments include office spaces at malls in Bengaluru (1.2msf), Chennai (0.4msf), and Palladium Mumbai (1.1msf). ""Additionally, newly launched malls in Pune (1.2msf) and Bengaluru (1.2msf) are also contributing to the growth of Phoenix Mills' office segment. These strategic expansions highlight the firm's commitment to increasing its office presence in high-demand urban areas,"" said Motilal Oswal. Motilal Oswal also said Phoenix Mills’ acquisition of the remaining 49 percent stake in Island Star Mall Developers (ISMDPL) will strengthen its premium retail portfolio and unlock long-term value. The deal is expected to be earnings-accretive from the first year, with further upside as rental income stabilizes and the 2.71 msf incremental FSI potential is developed over the medium term. Staggered payments over three years are likely to keep the net debt-to-equity ratio below 0.4x for the next two years.

"Sugar stocks rally up to 20% after govt allows ethanol production from sugarcane juice, molasses",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sugar-stocks-rally-up-to-12-after-govt-allows-ethanol-production-from-sugarcane-juice-molasses-13510529.html,"Sugar stocks surged in morning trade on September 2 after the government decided to remove limits on ethanol production from sugarcane juice, sugar syrup, and molasses for the year 2025-26. The government had restricted production of ethanol from sugarcane juice, syrup and all types of molasses in the current marketing year amid a drop in sugarcane supplies. In the new ethanol supply year starting from November 1, sugar mills and distilleries will be allowed to produce ethanol without any quantitative restriction, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution said. The Department of Food and Public Distribution (DFPD) will periodically review the sugar diversion to ethanol to ensure year-round domestic availability of the sweetener, it said. This comes as sugarcane supplies are expected to jump in the new season as ample monsoon rains for two straight years have helped farmers expand area under the crop. Balrampur Chini Mills shares jumped more than 7 percent to trade at Rs 580 apiece, while Shree Renuka Sugars shares rallied over 15 percent to trade at Rs 33 apiece. Bajaj Hindusthan Sugar and Godavari Biorefineries shares gained 12 percent and 5 percent respectively. Uttam Sugar Mills shares rallied over 9 percent, while Dhampur Sugar Mills and Magadh Sugar & Energy shares were trading around 10 percent higher. Triveni Engineering shares were up 4.5 percent, while Dwarikesh Sugar and other stocks gained up to 14 percent. Smallcap stock Rajshree Sugars & Chemicals meanwhile surged 20 percent to hit the upper circuit at Rs 45.26 apiece. Earlier yesterday, the Supreme Court dismissed a plea which challenged the nationwide rollout of 20 percent Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP-20). The petitioner had alleged that vehicles manufactured in India prior to April 2023 are not compatible with ethanol mix petrol. Vehicles as new as 2 years old are also not compatible with ethanol mixed petrol wherein the percentage of ethanol is 20 percent, despite the cars being BS-VI compliant, the person added. The plea, filed by advocate Akshay Malhotra, had sought a direction to the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas to ensure availability of ethanol-free petrol at all fuel stations. A bench headed by Chief Justice of India BR Gavai, along with Justice K Vinod Chandran, dismissed the plea. Attorney General R Venkataramani, opposing the petition, said that the matter had already been thoroughly examined before the policy’s rollout. He alleged that the petitioner was merely a “front” for a larger lobby and stressed that the policy benefits sugarcane farmers while also conserving foreign exchange. “Should people outside the country decide what fuel India should use?” the AG remarked.

This comes following the appointment of Rajiv Anand as the managing director and chief executive officer of the bank. The lender has faced a series of exits at senior level since April this year, including CEO Sumant Kathpalia, after discrepancies in derivatives accounting and MFI books were reported. The irregularities in the microfinance book were reported as fraud committed against the bank. Prior to joining IndusInd Bank, Pragati Gondhalekar was the country head – group audit, India at Deutsche Bank. She has also held leadership roles at L&T Financial, PwC, among others. The bank's net profit fell by 68% on-year during the June quarter, weighed down by a sharp rise in provisions. The lender has been focusing on rebuilding the senior leadership team after the recent setbacks on the accounting crisis, and the subsequent regulatory glare. ""...wherever there were any open gaps, we are looking at both internal and external candidates and sort of filling that up. And I think all the building blocks from a management leadership team are being looked at very closely. And we are hopeful that a lot of these positions will get filled up in due course,"" chairman Sunil Mehta had told analysts during the June quarter earnings call. ""I feel that whatever we have witnessed over the last 3 to 4 months, it should have never happened. But since it did happen, we have learnt a lot of lessons from the same. We are making good progress in addressing all those issues of the past and certainly looking forward in building the Bank of the future,"" Mehta had said at the analyst call in July."

"Sensex, Nifty to extend gains to second day? Key levels to track on September 2",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sensex-nifty-to-extend-gains-to-second-day-key-levels-to-track-on-september-2-13509759.html,"Indian benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty are likely to be on firm footing on September 2, extending the positive momentum from the start of the new month, powered by gains in IT and auto stocks. At around 7:22 am, GIFT Nifty quoted 24,767, up 0.16 percent, signaling a steady start for Dalal Street. The optimism stems from Monday’s broad-based buying, driven by India’s stronger-than-expected GDP growth in the first quarter. IT and auto counters were the star performers, while India VIX slipped 4 percent, hinting at improving market stability. However, flows remained divergent - Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) offloaded equities worth Rs 1,430 crore, even as Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) stepped in aggressively with net purchases of Rs 4,345 crore. On the technical front, Nifty has broken out of a falling wedge pattern—a classic bullish reversal signal. “As long as the index sustains above 24,540–24,500, the trend remains positive, with upside targets at 24,700–24,800 and possibly 24,900. A drop below 24,460 would be the first sign of weakness,” said Hariprasad K, SEBI-registered Research Analyst and Founder of Livelong Wealth. Global sentiment offered additional support. A US court declared most of President Trump’s tariffs illegal, though they will remain in effect until October 14 pending a Supreme Court review. Meanwhile, Asia-Pacific markets opened largely higher, as investors tracked developments at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) leaders’ meeting in Tianjin, even as tariff uncertainty lingered. Japan’s Nikkei 225 advanced 0.3 percent, South Korea’s Kospi gained 0.4 percent, while Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 slipped 0.4 percent. US markets were shut on Monday for the Labor Day holiday, and futures traded flat in early Asian hours at the start of what has historically been a challenging month for equities, especially amid renewed trade-related jitters following the court ruling.

"Asian stocks edge up, Japan bond auction in focus",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/asian-stocks-edge-up-japan-bond-auction-in-focus-13509720.html,"Asian stocks posted modest gains at the open Tuesday, with attention back on technology shares and the artificial intelligence sector following the surge in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s shares. Shares in Japan and South Korea rebounded after Monday’s losses while Australia’s declined. US equity-index futures edged lower after cash markets were closed Monday for Labor Day. West Texas Intermediate crude oil climbed in early trading and gold extended its gains to a sixth day, its longest winning streak since April 2024. Treasuries retreated in early trading with yield on the benchmark 10-year rising three basis points to 4.26%. Japan’s 10-year government bond auction Tuesday will be a key test of investor appetite amid growing expectations of rate hikes by the Bank of Japan and mounting political uncertainty. After a selloff in technology shares in Wall Street Friday, the record-breaking stock rally faces a pivotal test this month, with jobs numbers, inflation data and the Federal Reserve’s rate call all landing within the next three weeks. Tariff tensions and questions over the Fed’s independence are also compounding the risks in September, historically the weakest month of the year for US markets. “The bar to derail a Fed rate cut on Sept. 17 appears high,” Deutsche Bank AG economist Peter Sidorov wrote. “But with Fed funds futures now pricing over 140 basis points of easing by the end of 2026, markets are expecting an amount of easing that since the 1980s has only occurred around recessions.” A gauge tracking emerging-market equities notched its best session in a week amid thin liquidity due to the US holiday, boosted by AI-related stocks in Hong Kong and China. The MSCI EM Index closed 0.7% higher as Alibaba jumped 19% in Hong Kong — the most in three years — after the Chinese e-commerce giant reported a triple-digit percentage gain in AI-related product revenue as well as a better-than-anticipated 26% jump in sales from the cloud division. The rally marks a break from last week’s broader Asian market decline after a tech selloff hit Wall Street. Another key factor for the markets is the Cboe Volatility Index sitting at 16.12, not far off its 2025 closing low of 14.22. “The fact that investors are still betting heavily on new lows in volatility, even with VIX at what appears to be a floor, and with markets up sharply from their April lows to all-time highs, should be viewed with caution,” said Jeff Jacobson, a strategist at 22V Research, in a note Monday. Traders will also be closely monitoring Indonesian markets after stocks tumbled the most in nearly five months on Monday. Political risks have recently flared, with President Prabowo Subianto canceling a China trip after deadly unrest over living costs and inequality. Stress also was evident in the bond market, with yields on the nation’s 10-year government note rising to the highest in almost three weeks. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump said India offered to cut its tariff rates following the US imposition last week of 50% levies as punishment for its purchases of Russian oil. In Europe, bonds weakened broadly, with a week to go before a confidence vote that could topple France’s government. The French-German 10-year spread, a key measure of risk, was little changed at 79 basis points. The gauge closed at 82 on Aug. 27, the highest since January. Longer-maturity bonds may be in for a treacherous September, if history is any guide. Over the last decade, government bonds globally with maturities of over 10 years posted a median loss of 2% in September, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the worst monthly performance of the year."

The case originated from a thematic inspection of REITs, where Sebi observed that the applicant had allegedly facilitated distribution of Net Distributable Cash Flow (NDCF) using borrowed funds, a practice not permitted under the REIT Regulations. The market regulator had alleged contravention of Regulation 7(d) of the Sebi (REIT) Regulations, 2014. Settlement order noted, “Applicant for alleged violation of the aforesaid provisions. Briefly stated, it was, inter alia, observed and alleged in respect of the Applicant that it had made use of borrowed funds for facilitating distribution of Net Distributable Cash Flow”. Following the observations, a show-cause notice was issued, initiating adjudication proceedings. While proceedings were pending, Brookprop Management Services filed a settlement application on July 26, 2024, under the Sebi settlement proceedings, proposing to resolve the matter without admitting or denying the findings. After discussions with Sebi’s Internal Committee in October 2024, the applicant submitted revised terms in November.

"Kaynes Tech, Dixon Tech, other EMS stocks surge up to 7% after PM Modi's visit to China",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/kaynes-tech-dixon-tech-other-ems-stocks-surge-up-to-7-after-pm-modi-s-visit-to-china-13508417.html,"The shares of Electronic Manufacturing Services (EMS) companies jumped on September 1 as Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to China boosted investor sentiment. EMS companies have strong ties with Chinese component manufacturers. The earlier tensions between India and China following geopolitical disputes had impacted the stocks, as investors remained concerned over supply chain disruption. Prime Minister Narendra Modi attended the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Tianjin, China. At the summit, he met Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin. This holds strong significance in global geopolitics after US President Donald Trump's administration increased tariffs on Indian imports to a whopping 50 percent. Kaynes Technology shares gained nearly 8 percent to trade at Rs 6,595 apiece. The company imports most of its raw materials from outside, including various electronic components that are mostly sourced from China. The easing tensions between India and China after PM Modi's visit will likely boost the stock, on expectations of easing impact on supply chains. Dixon Technologies (India) shares jumped around 6 percent to close at Rs 17,625 apiece. Earlier this year, Dixon Technologies formed a joint venture with China's HKC to produce display modules by September 2025. The company is also exploring similar partnerships for precision components, mechanicals, camera modules, and battery packs. ""We have hired a senior resource and are building a team to execute these projects. The component PLI rollout by the government will strengthen our backward integration and open a massive market for Dixon,"" said Managing Director Atul Lall during the company’s Q3 earnings call.

"EV makers Ola, Ather’s shares soar on hopes of easier access to Chinese rare earth magnets, GST reform benefits",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/ev-makers-ola-ather-s-shares-soar-on-hopes-of-easier-access-to-chinese-rare-earth-magnets-gst-reform-benefits-13507047.html,"Shares of EV two-wheeler makers sharply surged on September 1, with Ola Electric and Ather Energy rising more than 14 percent each on positive outcome from the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in China, and the tailwind from proposed GST reforms that could drive sales. Ola Electric shares hit an intraday high of Rs 61.88 while Ather Energy shares hit an all-time high of Rs 512.80 apiece during the trade. PM Modi at SCO Summit Over the weekend, Prime Minister Modi met Chinese President Xi Jinping, at a time when India's automotive sector has been seeking further relaxation in Beijing's curbs on rare earths magnets, which have been in place since April, hampering EV makers' production plans. More than 50 Indian applications to import heavy rare earth magnets are awaiting approval in China, Bloomberg News had reported citing people familiar with the matter. China has, however, started lifting the restrictions on rare earth metals and critical minerals exports amid signs of a thaw in trade relations with China. While an official statement is still awaited, PM Modi's visit to China has likely boosted hopes for relaxation in export curbs, which will likely benefit EV-makers like Ola Electric and Ather Energy. GST Reforms Expectations The GST Council, chaired by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, is slated to meet in New Delhi on September 3-4 to deliberate on the Centre's proposal for a simplified two-rate structure of 5 percent and 18 percent. Market experts are attributing this to be a strong boost for several sectors, and autos, including EVs, are likely be benefitted from the reform. PLI push for Ola Electric Shares of Ola Electric Mobility have been extending gains after securing PLI certification from the Centre for its Gen 3 scooter portfolio. In an exchange filing on August 26, Ola Electric had said, ""(Ola Electric) has received Certification for Compliance with the eligibility assessment requirements under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for automobile and auto components sector, for its Gen 3 scooter portfolio. This certification was granted by the Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) under the aegis of the Ministry of Heavy Industries, Government of India to all of the seven Ola S1 Gen 3 scooters."" The EV-scooter maker said its Gen 2 and Gen 3 scooter portfolio are now PLI-certified. Its Gen 3 portfolio, which comprises S1 Pro 3 kWh, S1 Pro 4 kWh, S1 Pro+ 4 kWh, S1 X 2 kWh, S1 X 3 kWh, S1 X 4 kWh and S1 X+ 4 kWh, comprises majority of its current sales. As a result, this certification is set to significantly enhance its profitability from Q2FY26 onwards, the company said. Investor interest in the shares have revived after Helios Mutual Fund recently added Ola Electric to its portfolio, Dinshaw Irani, CEO of the fund house had told The Economic Times. Irani compared Ola to Eternal (Zomato), to showcase Helios' early bet in the food delivery giant played out. Helios had bought Zomato shares for around Rs 40 apiece, and the shares are currently trading at around Rs 320 apiece. Ola Electric shares are currently trading over 14 percent higher at Rs 61.62 apiece, having rallied over 56 percent from its 52-week low of Rs 39.60 apiece, hit in July this year. Ather Energy shares were trading around 12 percent higher after hitting an all-time high earlier in the session, and the shares have gained 69 percent since listing in May this year.

"From today, listed firms must provide granular disclosures for related party transactions",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/from-today-listed-firms-must-provide-granular-disclosures-for-related-party-transactions-13507239.html,"Starting today, nearly 5,000 listed companies will be required to follow a new set of rules issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) for approval of related party transactions (RPTs). The framework, which becomes effective September 1, is aimed at bringing greater transparency and equipping shareholders with more detailed information to make informed decisions. Related party transactions are business dealings between a company and entities that share a pre-existing relationship—such as subsidiaries, key management personnel, or major shareholders. These dealings often raise governance concerns if not adequately disclosed, as they may result in conflicts of interest or potential misuse of company resources. In June this year, Sebi directed listed entities to adopt minimum disclosure standards as prescribed by the Industry Standards Forum (ISF), a body comprising representatives from industry chambers like FICCI, CII, and ASSOCHAM, working in collaboration with the regulator and stock exchanges. These standards mandate that companies share detailed information with audit committees and shareholders before seeking approval for RPT proposals. Also read: Sebi panel recommends open offer process may be faster with quicker payout to investors Greater clarity and explanatory statements According to Makarand M Joshi, Founder of MMJC & Associates, “Explanatory statements for approving material RPTs need to be made more self-explanatory. It shall contain information, not only meeting but significantly exceeding the requirements of the Companies Act, 2013 viz. Data placed before audit committee, pricing methodology, certification from KMP, QR code for report of any etc.” He further noted that drafting such explanatory statements will now require far more diligence to enable better informed shareholder decision-making. The ISF-prescribed format specifies that management must present details of related parties’ shareholding or contribution to profit and loss of the listed entity or its subsidiary, both directly and indirectly. Likewise, shareholding of the related party in the listed entity must also be disclosed.In addition, information such as the financial performance of the related party, details of past transactions, and specifics of the proposed transaction—including nature, size, and rationale—must be clearly laid out. Wide coverage of transactions The new rules go beyond generic disclosures. For instance, transactions relating to loans, inter-corporate deposits, advances, or investments by the listed entity or its subsidiaries must now be accompanied by details of source of funds and rationale. Similarly, any proposed guarantee, indemnity, or comfort letter given by a company or subsidiary must be explained with the reasoning behind it. If transactions involve borrowings, sale, lease, or disposal of assets of subsidiaries or units, then audit committees must also be provided with bidding details and information about bidders.When it comes to royalty payments, the requirements are even more extensive. Companies will have to disclose the purpose of royalty paid during the last three years, break up payments made for brand use, technology know-how, professional or management fees, and compare royalty growth rates with growth in turnover, profit after tax, and dividends. Firms will also need to provide evidence of benefits derived from technology transfers and compare their royalty outgo with industry peers. Also read: Is Sebi revisiting F&O suitability? Recent remarks indicate entry criteria discussion is back on table and here's how it could look Sebi’s study on royalty payments Sebi had earlier conducted a comprehensive study of royalty payments across 233 listed companies between FY14 and FY23. The regulator found several instances where firms paid royalty to related parties exceeding 20% of their net profits. Alarmingly, even loss-making firms were making royalty pay-outs. The study revealed 1,538 instances of royalty payments falling below the 5% turnover approval threshold, while 185 cases involved loss-making companies paying a cumulative Rs 1,355 crore as royalty. Sebi observed that such practices raised questions on governance and shareholder value. Certification to protect shareholders Under the new framework, companies must also provide certifications from the CEO, CFO, or other key managerial personnel, and from every promoter-director, confirming that the proposed RPTs are not prejudicial to public shareholders. If any promoter-director fails to provide such certification, the fact must be disclosed to the audit committee and shareholders before approval.Pavan Vijay, Founder, Corporate Professionals says, “The RPT Industry Standards enhance investor confidence by ensuring greater transparency and comparability in related party disclosures at the time of approval. Investors can now better assess the fairness of transactions involving promoters or key stakeholders, identify governance lapses and benchmark disclosures across companies and industries”. He further says, “Professionals should ensure consistency with the structured format specified in Para 4 of the RPT Industry Standards, clearly disclose transaction terms, avoid vague or incomplete information and provide valuation or other external reports to the Audit Committee and shareholders (through a QR code or web-link), among other requirements”. Anjali Malhotra, Partner- Regulatory, Nangia Andersen LLP  says, ""The requirement to have standardized formats for approval of RPT’s emerged due to precedents wherein funds were diverted through related parties for personal use and information was camouflaged which could have enabled the audit committee o or shareholders to judiciously accord their approvals. The historic examples depict how gaps in transparency can disrupt stakeholders trust, threat business continuity and invite regulatory actions"". Transparency and compliance The regulator had initially set July 1, 2025, as the effective date for the circular. However, based on industry feedback, the implementation was deferred to September 1 to allow companies more time to align their systems and processes. With the new rules now coming into force, experts believe Indian capital markets are poised to see stronger governance practices. By ensuring that shareholders receive more granular information, Sebi aims to reduce opacity in related party dealings and enhance investor confidence. Additionally, Sebi has proposed easing related party transaction rules by raising shareholder approval threshold to Rs 5,000 crore and waiving disclosures for deals below Rs 15 crore. The consultation paper issued last month proposes to simplify compliance, boost transparency, and strengthen corporate governance norms."
