Sequentially NII stood flat, led by higher finance costs on account of increased external borrowings. Total operating income grew by 24.6% YoY (1.9% QoQ) to INR 5,207 Mn, majorly led by increase in net interest income. Pre-Provision Operating Profit (PPoP) grew by 8.0% YoY (-2.1% QoQ) to INR 3,659 Mn., led by stronger momentum in NII growth driven by sharp ramp-up in AUM.

However, the company took an impairment of Rs1.4bn during the quarter on account of take-or-pay. As a result, despite higher-than-estimated volume, the company reported an in-line EBITDA of Rs11.6bn (Ple Rs11.9bn, BBGe Rs12.6bn, -26% YoY, -23.3% QoQ). PAT came in at Rs8.5bn (Ple Rs8.1bn, BBGe Rs9bn, -25% YoY, - 20.5% QoQ). Concerns remain on utilization of its assets amidst rising competition, especially from the recently commissioned Chhara LNG terminal and completion of breakwater facility at Dabhol LNG terminal. Ongoing capex on petrochemical project is also expected to be ROCE dilutive. Outlook We value the stock at Rs311 (previous Target Price Rs315), based on 10x (unchanged) FY27 EPS.

While credit cost was controlled (at 2.1%), Stage 2 increased by 40 bps QoQ. We remain conservative and build a higher credit cost of 2.1% for FY26E (vs. guidance of <2%). We marginally tweak our FY26/ FY27 estimates and expect SHFL to deliver RoA/ RoE of 3.3%/ 17.0% in FY27E, led by steady growth in AUM, favourable margin profile and controlled asset quality ratios.

While NII was cushioned as cash was utilized to pay-off borrowings, Q2FY26 would see impact of normal liquidity and 50bps repo cut suggesting NIM decline QoQ. However, H2FY26 NIM could improve due to CRR cut and deposit repricing. While loan growth was healthy at 4.2% QoQ, it was led by SME and mid-market. Barring housing, retail growth was sluggish due to weak demand while unsecured recovery is slower. Hence, we trim loan growth by 100bps for FY26/27E to 16% YoY. Asset quality worsened QoQ due to higher net slippages/provisions led by MFI stress and slower corporate recovery. Outlook We cut NIM & fees, increase provisions but reduce opex; net cut in core PAT for FY26/27E is avg. 4.2% We tweak multiple to 2.3x from 2.4x on Mar’27 core ABV and slightly reduce TP to Rs2,350 from Rs2,400.

TTAN will be paying an EV of AED 1038mn, which will be funded through a debt of Rs12bn and small funding from reserves. Damas has debt of ~700mn AED and working capital is funded by gold metal loan. TTAN plans to close stores catering to Se Asian population with gold jewellery and convert many of these into Tanishq stores. 3 Graff stores (20% of sales) are not a part of this transaction while 110 signature stores will be scaled up. 2025 will be the year of re-structuring and the transaction will be EPS dilutive in CY26. It will be EPS neutral in CY27 and will be EPS accretive only in CY28. This acquisition provides Titan plans to leverage its expertise in sourcing, inventory management, and customer acquisition to drive backend and technological efficiencies which along with superior gross margin, and improved product mix will drive margins higher. Outlook At current sales of Rs26.3bn (ex of Graff), DAMAS EV/Sales multiple stands at 0.95x, which is in-line with most global retailers. We believe, Damas acquisition will add value over next 3-4 years and does not add any upside in the near to medium term.

More importantly, the Direct business stood on a strong footing, grew 1.6% QoQ CC, led by BFS (+8.1% QoQ) and Insurance (+21.0% QoQ). The record high deal TCV of USD760m (80%+ New Gen) aided by four large deal wins in Q1 of three 100m+ TCV and one 50m+ TCV. Despite having recorded notable large wins in Q1, the deal funnel still looks encouraging (84% YoY). BFS and non-BFS pipelines are up 47% YoY and 108% YoY, respectively. We believe the company’s strong participation in AI-led transformation (68% AI-led deal pipeline) and taking ownership of client budgets through inevitable AI investments, partly de-risk the discretionary churn. The consistent increase in large deal wins and steady conversion rate (TCV to Revenue), which is missing in many of its peers, gives us confidence to stay positive on Mphasis. Outlook We are baking revenue growth of 6.2%/8.0% YoY CC with EBIT margin of 15.5%/15.7% for FY26E/FY27E. We are assigning 26x to FY27 EPS, translating a TP of 2,920.

Mgmt guided strong US revenues of $1bn for FY27 despite gRevlimid erosion. We expect Cipla to maintain its existing US sales run-rate. This will be aided by several high value niche launches in the US like gAbraxane, Nilotininb, gAdvair. Further, Cipla’s strong net cash position of +$1.5bn provides flexibility to pursue strategic M&A opportunities. Our FY26E/27E EPS broadly remain unchanged. At CMP, stock is trading 23x FY26E EPS.

Fall in reported NIM at 6-7bps QoQ was lower to peers (11-18bps decline). NIM may remain under pressure in Q2FY26 due to lead-lag impact of repo rate cut on loans/deposits. However, bank expects 70% of deposits to reprice within 1-2 quarters suggesting that NIM would start improving since Q3FY26. Loans de-grew by 2.0% QoQ due to 10% fall in corporate; however, BOB expects corporate growth of 8-10% YoY for FY26; we are factoring overall loan growth of 11% YoY in FY26.

Ather Energy ties up with government to strengthen EV manufacturing ecosystem,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/ather-energy-ties-up-with-government-to-strengthen-ev-manufacturing-ecosystem-13341768.html,"Electric vehicle maker Ather Energy has signed an MoU with the Commerce Ministry to speed up growth in clean mobility and advanced manufacturing, as part of the Build in Bharat initiative led by Startup Policy Forum (SPF), a government statement said on July 29. Shares of Ather Energy were off lows in a quiet session of trade, higher by close to a percent. Since its listing in May 2025, shares of Ather are higher by close to 14 percent. As part of the tie up, Ather Energy will focus on 'strategic mentorship' for deep-tech startups, along with infrastructure-related support for upcoming players in the EV value chain. The partnership will aim to accelerate the growth of clean mobility and advanced manufacturing sectors. Ather will conduct innovation programs along with DPIIT, co-hosted skill development, and participation in Startup Mahakumbh to encourage the development of the clean mobility ecosystem. Tarun Mehta, the co-founder and CEO of Ather Energy said, “We are happy to collaborate with DPIIT to strengthen support systems for hardware and deep-tech startups. With policy support and stronger industry participation, this initiative can help founders tackle core technology challenges and scale high-quality products from India.” The initiative is aimed at supporting India's transition towards sustainable transport and help create an enabling environment for manufacturing-focused startups. After the MoU, Sanjiv Singh DPIIT Joint Secretary said India's electric mobility space is entering a transformative phase. “Through this partnership with Ather Energy, we aim to catalyse the development of an enabling environment where startups can contribute meaningfully to EV manufacturing, battery innovation, and clean energy solutions,” Sanjiv Singh added. This collaboration opens up opportunities for EV startups by supporting a future-ready, self-reliant ecosystem aligned with climate goals and manufacturing-driven aspirations. Shweta Rajpal Kohli, President and CEO, Startup Policy Forum said the partnership is vital for SPFs 'Build in Bharat' initiative, and unlocks the potential of manufacturing through collaboration. Ather Energy narrowed its losses in the March quarter of FY25 to Rs 234.4 crore on strong demand for top-selling 'Rizta' family scooters. Indian EV makers are gradually preparing for a future without subsidies, as the Centre plans to phase out or reduce incentives for electric vehicles, transitioning from manufacturing sops to pricing and technology. Earlier this year, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal had said that India's EVs do not need fresh incentives. “India’s electric mobility segment is ready and set to fly. There is no need for new incentives as the existing ones are sufficient to kick-start the ecosystem,” Goyal said in January 2025."

Technical View The index has decisively broken down from its prolonged consolidation phase, violating multiple support levels and confirming a bearish shift in the near-term structure. If the Nifty breaches 24,650 on a closing basis, we may witness accelerated unwinding, pushing the index further down toward the 24,500–24,450 band. On the upside, the resistance zone has now migrated downward to 24,960–25,000, and any attempted relief rally toward this band may face renewed supply pressure. Until the index reclaims and sustains above 25,000, the broader bias will firmly remain negative, and rallies may be used to initiate fresh shorts rather than as signs of reversal The ongoing breakdown clearly signals a shift in sentiment, and it’s crucial for traders to remain aligned with the prevailing trend. JSW Steel, IndusInd Bank, Jio Financial Services, ONGC, and Tata Consumer Products were the top gainers on the Nifty. Laggards on the index included Bharat Electronics, Eternal, Infosys, Wipro, and SBI Life Insurance.

The lender reported a 68 percent decline in standalone net profit at Rs 684 crore, hurt by a decline in loans and a rise in provisions for potential bad loans. On a consolidated basis, net profit fell 72 percent year-over-year to Rs 604 crore. The lender's net interest income fell 14 percent year-on-year to Rs 4,640 crore in Q1FY26. According to Moneycontrol's poll, IndusInd Bank's net interest income (NII) was seen at Rs 4,279 crore in Q1FY26 and profit was pegged at Rs 559 crore in Q1FY26. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Should you buy, sell or hold the IndusInd Bank stock? Macquarie has an underperform call with a target of Rs 650, implying a downside potential of 19 percent from the last close on the NSE. Its Q1 profit was in line with expectations, supported by higher NIMs and treasury gains, but these were offset by weak fee income. Elevated slippages led to higher credit costs, and the brokerage expects return on assets (RoAs) to stay below 1 percent in the near term. CITI has a sell rating and a target price of Rs 765. The brokerage said Q1 results pointed to a gradual reset in key levers such as NIM, fee income, and credit costs. While legacy issues didn’t reappear, fee-to-assets dropped to 1.2 percent, and credit costs stayed high at 2 percent. Slippages in the MFI portfolio nearly halved, but stress in vehicle finance and broader retail led to overall slippages of 3 percent. GNPAs rose across segments, though core NIM at 3.35 percent was a positive surprise. CITI believes improvement depends on stabilising NIMs, growing fees, cutting costs, and lowering credit costs. CLSA has a hold call with a target of Rs 725. The international brokerage noted that management is focused on stabilising the business, and the board has submitted MD & CEO nominations to the RBI. Loans and deposits both fell 3 percent quarter-on-quarter, mainly due to weakness in the wholesale segment. Core NIM declined by 12 basis points QoQ, in line with trends seen in other large private lenders. Bernstein is outperforming on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,000. It noted that Q1 results showed no impact from previous clean-up efforts, but persistent issues remain, including asset quality deterioration, weak fee income, and subdued NIMs. Bernstein flagged the lack of clear levers to improve RoA in the near term, which may prompt a reassessment of the bank’s profitability outlook. During the quarter, the Bank’s Total Capital Adequacy Ratio as per Basel III guidelines (excluding Q1 profits) stands at 16.63 percent as on June 30, 2025, as compared to 17.04 percent as on June 30, 2024.

"Sensex, Nifty set for weak open amid mixed global cues; key levels to track on July 29",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sensex-nifty-set-for-weak-open-amid-mixed-global-cues-key-levels-to-track-on-july-29-13340662.html,"Sensex and Nifty are set to extend their losing streak on July 29, as global jitters and disappointing earnings weigh on sentiment. US markets ended mixed after a strong start, while Asian peers slipped. The GIFT Nifty was down 40 points at 24,665 around 7:45 pm, signalling a weak open. Bears dragged Dalal Street deep into the red, while selling pressure in key financial stocks also contributed to heavy losses in the Nifty 50 and Sensex indices, on Friday, July 25. All sectoral indices, barring pharma and healthcare, sank deep into the red. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates On July 28, Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) were net sellers to the tune of Rs 6,082 crore worth of shares in Indian equities, while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) net bought Rs 6765 crore worth of shares, according to provisional NSE data. This is the highest net selling by FIIs since May 30 and the highest net buying by DIIs since June 17. Here are the key levels to watch out for in today's session The index has decisively broken down from its prolonged consolidation phase, violating multiple support levels and confirming a bearish shift in the near-term structure. If the Nifty breaches 24,650 on a closing basis, we may witness accelerated unwinding, pushing the index further down toward the 24,500–24,450 band. On the upside, the resistance zone has now migrated downward to 24,960–25,000, and any attempted relief rally toward this band may face renewed supply pressure. Until the index reclaims and sustains above 25,000, the broader bias will firmly remain negative, and rallies may be used to initiate fresh shorts rather than as signs of reversal The ongoing breakdown clearly signals a shift in sentiment, and it’s crucial for traders to remain aligned with the prevailing trend. ""The current week brings elevated event-risk with the FOMC meeting and updates on US trade tariff policies looming large. Against this backdrop, the index decisively slipped below its 50-Day exponential moving average, currently anchored near 56,110, which had repeatedly served as a key cushion in recent declines—its violation has further aggravated market jitters. A decisive break and close beneath the 56,000 handle would likely escalate selling intensity, potentially dragging the benchmark toward the 55,500–55,450 zone in the short run,"" Dhupesh Dhameja of SAMCO Securities said. The India VIX spiked by 6.98 percent, closing at 12.06, continuing its upward journey for the second straight session—marking a cumulative 11 percent rise in just two days. This suggests that participants are bracing for heightened volatility in light of key global cues. That said, VIX remains below the 13 mark, indicating that long-term investors are not exiting en masse. The Put-Call Ratio (PCR) slipped further from 0.65 to 0.59, reflecting increased call exposure and a tilt in favor of bears. However, the falling PCR is approaching oversold territory, warranting close observation as it may signal short-term exhaustion. This reallocation of positioning by both option writers suggests that traders are bracing for additional downside but are also staying agile amid an event-driven week.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade TCS, Cipla, Torrent Pharma, NCC, Paytm, SBI Life Insurance, UPL, Syrma SGS Technology and others on July 29?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-tcs-cipla-torrent-pharma-ncc-paytm-sbi-life-insurance-upl-syrma-sgs-technology-and-others-on-july-29-13339827.html,"Equity benchmarks started off the monthly F&O expiry week on a negative note, with the Nifty 50 declining 0.63 percent, extending its downward journey for the third straight session on July 28. The market breadth continued to be dominated by bears, with 2,043 shares declining compared to 673 advancing on the NSE. The market may continue to consolidate with a negative bias in the upcoming sessions. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi TCS | CMP: Rs 3,079.3  Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has been on a downward trajectory since mid-May 2025, consistently forming lower highs and lower lows. This bearish structure has led to a correction of nearly Rs 440, a decline of approximately 12.32 percent. However, the stock now stands at a technically significant zone, where both time and price confluence suggest a potential trend reversal. Historically, key pivot highs and lows in TCS have often occurred within a 25–38-day cycle. Notably, this time window aligns with both a Lucas number (29) and a Fibonacci number (34), adding further credibility to the time-based support. Additionally, a bullish Bat Harmonic Pattern is forming around the Rs 3,080–3,100 mark, coinciding with the S1 quarterly floor pivot, reinforcing the likelihood of a strong base. The MACD histogram is also showing signs of waning negative momentum, with shrinking red bars indicating a possible trend shift. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 3,100–3,070 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,335 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,960 Sun Pharmaceutical Industries | CMP: Rs 1,702.2  Sun Pharma has established a strong support base in the Rs 1,650–1,680 range, which aligns with the S3 Camarilla monthly pivot, marking a critical support zone. This area is further reinforced by a rising trendline and the lower median line of a pitchfork, forming a powerful technical confluence likely to attract renewed buying interest. The convergence of these multiple support levels enhances the likelihood of a bullish reversal. A decisive breakout above this consolidation zone could trigger a new upward movement. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 1,705–1,695 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,800 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,650 Cipla | CMP: Rs 1,572  Cipla has successfully breached its descending trendline on the weekly chart, accompanied by a notable surge in volume, signaling a potential trend reversal. The RSI on the weekly timeframe remains in the 45–50 range, which typically suggests building bullish momentum. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 1,575–1,565 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,670 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,520 Jay Thakkar, Vice President & Head of Derivatives and Quant Research at ICICI Securities Torrent Pharmaceuticals | CMP: Rs 3,622.9  Torrent Pharma has given a clean breakout from its consolidation and has since been forming higher highs and higher lows. The rising Open Interest suggests long buildup, indicating a positive trend in the short to medium term. Options activity shows strong Put writing across strikes from Rs 3,400 to Rs 3,600, while Call writers appear trapped at Rs 3,350 to Rs 3,400. This setup could cause short-term volatility, but any dip should be viewed as a buying opportunity. Buy Torrent Pharma August Futures in the range of Rs 3,660 to Rs 3,630. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,770, Rs 3,830 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,530 NCC | CMP: Rs 215.51  NCC has broken multiple support levels in the Rs 218–220 range, accompanied by a rise in Open Interest, indicating short buildup and suggesting further downside pressure in the near term. Since being introduced in the derivatives market, NCC has consistently witnessed short additions, and the recent breakdown adds further confirmation of the next leg of a downtrend. The stock faces a strong hurdle at Rs 230, where the highest Call open interest is placed. It is also trading below its maximum pain level and the 20-day VWAP, currently at Rs 225 and Rs 223, respectively. So, sell NCC August Futures in the range of Rs 220 to Rs 212, with a negative short-term outlook unless it closes above its key hurdles. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 204, Rs 200 Stop-Loss: Rs 225 Vidnyan S Sawant, Head of Research at GEPL Capital One 97 Communications | CMP: Rs 1,094.2  Paytm has been in a positive trend since May 2024. In the recent week, it broke out of a cup-and-handle formation, following the prior week’s breakout above the December 2024 swing high, both supported by a volume surge above the 20-week average, confirming strong participation.On the daily chart, the stock has shown resilience amid broader market volatility, holding steady near its 5-day EMA, with the 12- and 26-day EMAs rising, reflecting a strong underlying trend. The MACD remains in a rising trajectory, indicating sustained bullish momentum. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,225 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,039 SBI Life Insurance Company | CMP: Rs 1,850.5  SBI Life remains in a strong long-term uptrend, forming higher bottoms on the monthly chart since 2018. Despite recent consolidation on the weekly timeframe, it shows high relative strength, signaling resilience. On the daily chart, it has rebounded from the 50-day EMA and broken out of a 5-day range, indicating bullish momentum. It continues to trade above key 12- and 26-week EMAs, while the weekly RSI above 60 with hidden bullish divergence supports the case for further upside. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,053 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,755 UPL | CMP: Rs 730  UPL has delivered a decisive breakout above a sloping trendline on the monthly chart, supported by a strong bullish candlestick. On the weekly timeframe, the stock has gained momentum from the 5-week EMA, with volume surging above the 20-week average, indicating renewed buying interest.On the daily chart, the stock remains in a narrow range near the 5-day EMA, with rising 12- and 26-day EMAs, confirming a strengthening trend. The MACD remains in buy mode, reinforcing the bullish outlook. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 788 Stop-Loss: Rs 708 Syrma SGS Technology | CMP: Rs 746.35  Syrma SGS has shown strong bullish price action across all timeframes. On the monthly chart, the stock formed a robust bullish candlestick and hit an all-time high, signaling powerful upward momentum. On the weekly scale, it continues to form higher highs and higher lows, with rising volume, indicating growing investor participation. The stock is trading well above its key 5-, 12-, 25-, and 50-week EMAs, reinforcing trend strength. The MACD is also inching higher, supporting the continuation of the bullish momentum.

"Sona BLW defends board's independence, says company not family-run, Rani Kapur has had no role",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sona-blw-defends-board-s-independence-says-company-not-family-run-rani-kapur-has-had-no-role-13338172.html,"Sona BLW Precision Forgings has issued a fresh statement on July 28 in an effort to 'protect' shareholders' interest amid a tussle over family representation on the board, clarifying that Rani Kapur, mother of late Sunjay Kapur, has 'no locus standi' on any matter related to the company, denying any assertion of the firm being a family-run business as 'factually incorrect and misleading'. In a press statement, the company issued pointed clarifications that Rani Kapur has had no role in the company 'since at least 2019', and denied that she was coerced into signing any documents. The company added that the recent appointments on the board were 'ratified by an overwhelming majority' of shareholders. Rani Kapur Not a Shareholder The company clarified Rani Kapur, mother of late Sunjay Kapur, who wrote to the company through her legal representative stating seeking deferral of the board meeting on July 25, is neither a shareholder nor an official of the company, and her consent is not legally needed to run the business. ""Mrs. Rani Kapur has had no role, direct or indirect, in Sona Comstar since at least 2019. She is neither a shareholder, director, nor officer of the Company. As such, she has no locus standi on any matter related to the Company. Any insinuation that she was coerced into signing documents or that her consent is required for Company affairs is completely baseless and legally untenable,"" the statement said. Board is Independent: Sona BLW Sona BLW added that the company is run by a professional management and an independent Board, and the promoter entity - Aureus Investments - has only held one non-executive Board seat since the public issue of the company, currently has six independent directors and two executive directors with no relation to the family. ""The current board of 9 members include two executive directors — both seasoned professionals with no affiliation to the Kapur family — and six independent directors with exemplary reputations and distinguished careers. The promoter entity holds no executive roles and has no involvement in day-to-day management or strategic control of the Company,"" said the statement. Not a Family-run Business Sona BLW reiterated that the company has 71.98% shareholding with institutional and public investors, and is not a family-run business. ""The promoter entity holds a stake of 28.02% and exercises no special rights or control. The assertion that the Company is a family-run business is factually incorrect and misleading."" Board has the Confidence of Investors After the untimely demise of Sunjay Kapur, the board had re-appointed industry veteran Jeffrey Mark Overly as an Independent director for a second term, and later, Priya Sachdev Kapur as a Non-Executive director on the board. The decisions were 'fully compliant' with all laws and corporate governance norms, said the company. ""Their appointments were ratified by an overwhelming majority of shareholders — 98.9% and 99.4% respectively — clearly reflecting broad investor confidence,"" the statement added. Shareholder Value Eroded Pointing at the 'continued dissemination' of false narratives for 'personal legal agendas', Sona BLW said shareholder’ value is being eroded. ""With over 400,000 public shareholders, such actions are not only reckless but deeply harmful to the interests of the company."" Shares of Sona BLW had closed near the low point of the session on July 28, down 0.5 percent. Over past five sessions, the shares are down close to 3 percent. On July 25, Rani Kapur had raised strong objections to the AGM being held at a time of mourning for the family, and amid the 'suspicious' and sudden death of her son. Sunjay Kapur had passed away at the age of 53 on June 12 after suffering a heart attack in UK. The incident occurred while he was playing polo. In her letter to the board, Rani Kapur had said that she is the sole beneficiary of her late husband Surinder Kapur's estate, and the majority shareholder of the Sona Group including Sona Comstar."
Gainers & Losers: Top 10 stocks that moved the most on July 28,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/gainers-losers-top-10-stocks-that-moved-the-most-on-july-28-13337720.html,"Dalal Street kicked off the week on a sour note, extending losses from the previous session in trade on Monday, July 28. A poor set of numbers from Kotak Mahindra Bank soured the sentiment, with a strong sell-off seen in other heavyweights, which dragged the benchmark indices deep into the red. Kotak Mahindra Bank | CMP Rs 1,969 | Shares slipped over 7 percent after the bank's net profit took a 7 percent tumble. Kotak Mahindra Bank reported a standalone net profit of Rs 3,282 crore for Q1 FY26, marking a 7 percent year-on-year decline from Rs 3,520 crore in the same period last year. Going ahead, international brokerage Bernstein believes that the surge in credit costs and soft asset quality will continue to weigh on Kotak Mahindra Bank’s valuation. Aadhar Housing Finance | CMP Rs 514 | Shares surged over 5 percent to a record high after promoter Blackstone’s fund restructuring triggered a mandatory open offer. The offer, priced at Rs 469.97 per share for a 25.82 percent stake worth Rs 5,335 crore, follows a July 25 SPA where the acquirer agreed to buy up to 64.14 percent from BCP Topco VII Fund at up to Rs 425 per share. CDSL | CMP Rs 1,524 | Shares tanked over 5 percent after the company reported a lacklustre set of earnings for the quarter ended June 30, 2025. Net profit declined 23.6 percent year-on-year to Rs 102.4 crore, down from Rs 134 crore in the same quarter last year. Revenue from operations remained largely flat, inching up just 0.6 percent to Rs 259 crore compared to Rs 257.4 crore in Q1FY25. TCS | CMP Rs 3,085 | Shares were down as much as 2 percent after Moneycontrol exclusively reported that the IT services firm will trim its workforce by two percent, impacting 12,000 jobs over FY2026. Jefferies, along with other brokerages, noted that the plan to trim the workforce might lead to near-term execution slippages and higher long-term attrition. Shriram Finance | CMP Rs 632 | The stock rose nearly 3 percent after the company posted a strong set of numbers for the first quarter of FY26. Standalone net profit rose 9 percent year-on-year to Rs 2,156 crore, while net interest income (NII) grew 12.6 percent to Rs 6,026 crore. HSBC, Jefferies, Nuvama, and Motilal Oswal have given bullish ratings on the stock. ACME Solar | CMP Rs 296 | Shares surged as much as 9.5 percent on July 28, emerging as among the top gainers on NSE 500 index, after the management posted a many-fold jump in net profit at Rs 131 crore during the June quarter and a 72 percent on year growth in revenue at Rs 584 crore, powered by operational efficiencies. Realty Stocks | The shares of real estate companies recorded significant losses on July 28, as weak earnings by some of the players dampened investors' sentiment. Layoffs at TCS further fuelled the downturn in the sector. Macrotech Developers (Lodha) shares were the top loser on the index, dropping nearly 4 percent to trade at Rs 1,231 apiece. The company on July 26 (Saturday) reported a net profit of Rs 674.7 crore for the first quarter of the financial year 2026. Cipla | CMP Rs 1,570 | Shares rose over 2 percent after consolidated net profit rose 10 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,291.6 crore for the June 2025 quarter, from Rs 1,175.5 crore a year ago. Revenue from operations grew 4 percent to Rs 6,957.5 crore, compared to Rs 6,693.9 crore in the same period last year. Growth was driven by steady performance across key markets and effective cost controls. Margins remained stable despite some pressure from raw material costs. IndusInd Bank | CMP Rs 800 | Shares tanked as much as 3 percent ahead of its Q1 earnings. According to Moneycontrol's poll, IndusInd Bank's net interest income (NII) is seen at Rs 4,279 crore in Q1FY26 as against Rs 5,407 crore in the year-ago period. Profit is pegged at Rs 559 crore in Q1FY26 as compared to Rs 724 crore in the year-ago period. Waaree Energies | CMP Rs 3,097 | Shares slipped over 3 percent ahead of its Q1 earnings. Analysts expect the company to post a strong set of numbers for the quarter. Net profit is likely to come in around Rs 649–652 crore, as per estimates by two brokerages. Revenue is seen rising 31 percent year-on-year and 12 percent sequentially to around Rs 4,460–4,490 crore. The upbeat forecast reflects robust demand trends and steady execution during the quarter."
"SBI Cards shares plunge 6% post Q1 results: Should you buy, sell or hold?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sbi-cards-shares-plunge-6-after-firm-s-q1-net-profit-drops-to-rs-556-crore-should-you-buy-sell-or-hold-13337031.html,"The shares of SBI Cards and Payment Services dropped over 6 percent on July 28. This comes after brokerages slashed their rating and target prices for the stock following its weak Q1 earnings announcement. SBI Cards released its results for the first quarter of financial year 2026 in the post market hours of July 25 (Friday). It reported a net profit of Rs 556 crore for Q1 FY26. This marks a 6 percent on-year drop from the Rs 594 crore net profit reported in the same period last year. The firm’s total revenue from operations rose nearly 12 percent on-year to Rs 4,877 crore during the quarter under review. Its asset quality however declined on-year, with GNPA and NNPA margin standing at 3.07 percent and 1.42 percent respectively. Should you buy, sell or hold? Yes Securities downgraded the stock to 'Reduce', with a target price of Rs 847 apiece. This implies a downside potential of nearly 5 percent from the previous closing price. ""SBI Card’s PAT was 6% below expectation, even as PPOP stood 3% better than estimate, owing to an unexpected rise in credit cost to a new peak of 9.6% (annualized),"" the brokerage said. Emkay Global Financial Services retained its 'Add' rating on the stock, but reduced its target price by 5 percent to Rs 1,025 apiece. This implies an upside potential of more than 15 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. ""We believe SBIC will be a key beneficiary of the policy rate cut as well as asset quality normalization cycle in the card portfolio,"" the brokerage said. HDFC Securities maintained a 'Reduce' rating on the stock, with a target price of Rs 685 per share. This implies a downside potential of nearly 23 percent from the stock's previous closing price. ""SBI Cards' Q1FY26 earnings were lower than our estimates, largely led by high provisioning, partially offset by lower operating expenses. Credit costs remained elevated post marginal moderation in the previous quarter (net credit costs at 8.5% vs. 7.9% in Q4FY25),"" the firm said. Motilal Oswal Financial Services maintained its 'Neutral' rating on the stock, but reduced its target price for the stock to Rs 950 apiece. This implies an upside potential of nearly 7 percent from the stock's previous closing price. The domestic brokerage said that the firm's spends and receivables are likely to grow, and asset quality is likely to improve. ""NIMs may benefit from the declining interest rate cycle, resulting in a decline in CoF. Yields are expected to remain stable. We largely maintain our earnings estimates and expect SBICARD to post RoA/RoE of 4.4%/20.2% by FY27E,"" the firm said. SBI Cards shares closed at Rs 838.15 apiece. This is the lowest level seen by the stock in nearly four months.

Despite supportive global markets, the Indian market opened weak with Nifty below 24,800, however, initial hours recovery failed to build on and extended selling in the mid-session dragged the Nifty below 24,700 amid selling across the sectors barring pharma. At close, the Sensex was down 572.07 points or 0.70 percent at 80,891.02, and the Nifty was down 156.10 points or 0.63 percent at 24,680.90.

Click to View More Outlook for July 29 Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities Once again, bears ruled the day as the Nifty fell below 24,700 amid rising weakness in the market. During the session, the index faced resistance around the 50-EMA and remained below it until the close. The RSI continues to support the bears with its negative crossover. In the short term, the index may remain under pressure, with a possibility of slipping towards 24,550. On the higher end, resistance is seen at 24,800 and 24,950. Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets remained under pressure and declined over half a percent, extending the ongoing corrective phase. After an initial dip, the Nifty attempted to recover, but sharp selling in Kotak Bank following its earnings and continued weakness in select heavyweights from the telecom and IT sectors dragged the index lower as the session progressed. As a result, the Nifty slipped below its immediate support level of 24,700 and eventually settled at 24,680.90. Most sectors ended in the red, with realty, metal, and banking emerging as the top losers. The broader indices also came under pressure, shedding between 0.90% and 1.33%. Markets are currently grappling with headwinds on both domestic and global fronts. On the domestic side, earnings disappointments and persistent foreign fund outflows are dampening sentiment. In the banking space, earlier resilience had helped limit the decline; however, renewed pressure across the sector—except for heavyweights ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank—is adding to participants’ concerns. Globally, uncertainty surrounding trade deals, despite strength in the US markets, is contributing to the cautious approach. We now view the 24,450–24,550 zone as a critical support area, while the 24,900–25,000 range is likely to act as a resistance zone in case of a rebound. Traders should maintain a cautious stance and adjust their positions accordingly.

Shareholders State Bank of India, IDBI Bank, the National Stock Exchange (NSE), HDFC Bank, and others are sitting on significant gains as the IPO is expected to unlock staggering returns on investments made decades ago at extremely low valuations. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Largest lender SBI, for instance, is selling 40 lakh shares, originally bought at just Rs 2 each. At the upper end of the price band of Rs 800 per share, that translates to Rs 320 crore in proceeds on an initial investment of merely Rs 80 lakh, a return of nearly 399 times. IDBI Bank is set to make an even bigger haul, offloading 2.22 crore shares acquired at Rs 2 per share, which will result in the lender raking in around Rs 1,776 crore, turning a modest Rs 4.44 crore outlay into a massive windfall. NSE, another early backer, is also cashing in, selling 1.8 crore shares acquired at an average cost of Rs 12.28 apiece. The sale is expected to fetch around Rs 1,418 crore, an estimated return of over 64 times.

HDFC Bank, which entered at a relatively higher average price of Rs 108.29 per share, will make strong gains of nearly 638 percent, offloading 20.1 lakh shares. Union Bank of India, with a smaller stake, had picked up 5 lakh shares at Rs 5.20 per share, which are now set to bring in Rs 40 crore for the lender, at more than 150 times the initial investment. According to regulatory norms under SEBI's Depositories and Participants Regulations, no shareholder can hold more than 15 percent in a depository. That means entities like IDBI Bank (26.1 percent) and NSE (24 percent) are required to trim their stakes.

Allotment is likely on August 4, and shares are expected to debut on the bourses on August 6. As of July 28, NSDL's shares are commanding a grey market premium of Rs 137 over the IPO price, suggesting a potential 17.2 percent pop on debut. The grey market premium refers to the unofficial price at which shares of an upcoming IPO are traded before their official listing on a stock exchange. It reflects the market's expectation of the stock's listing price and can be an indicator of investor sentiment and demand for the IPO. ""As of March 31, 2025, we are the largest depository in India in terms of the number of issuers, the number of active instruments, market share in demat value of settlement volume and value of assets held under custody.

"Real estate shares continue to fall for 5th day, decline up to 6%; weak Q1 results of Lodha, TCS layoffs weigh",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/real-estate-shares-continue-to-fall-for-5th-day-decline-up-to-4-weak-q1-results-of-lodha-oberoi-realty-weigh-13336743.html,"The shares of real estate companies recorded significant losses on July 28, as weak earnings by some of the players dampened investors' sentiment. Layoffs at TCS further fuelled the downturn in the sector. The sharp fall in the share prices pushed the Nifty Realty index down more than 4 percent, to emerge as the top sector loser on the market today. The realty index closed at 911.90, extending losses for the fifth consecutive session. Macrotech Developers (Lodha) shares were the top loser on the index, dropping more than 6 percent to close at Rs 1,198.70 apiece. The company on July 26 (Saturday) reported a net profit of Rs 674.7 crore for the first quarter of the financial year 2026. This marks a 42 percent on-year rise from the Rs 475.3 crore net profit reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year. On a sequential basis, net profit however declined 27 percent from Rs 921.7 crore reported in the January-March quarter. The firm’s revenue from operations meanwhile gained nearly 23 percent on-year to Rs 3,419.7 crore in Q1 FY26, but fell more than 17 percent sequentially from Rs 4,224.3 crore in Q4 FY25. Earlier during the day, Macrotech Developers shares dropped nearly 7 percent to hit an intraday low of Rs 1,190.60 apiece. The stock has recovered some losses now. TCS is letting go 2 percent of its staff, or roughly 12,000 employees in a bid to become more agile and future-ready, Moneycontrol exclusively reported. The IT giant's move comes amid rapid disruptions in technology. However, the firm's CEO K Krithivasan told Moneycontrol that the move was not a fallout of the adoption of artificial intelligence, but to address skills for the future. A downturn in the IT sector will likely have a ripple down effect on the real estate sector. Heavyweights DLF and Godrej Properties dropped more than 4 percent and 5 percent respectively. Brigade Enterprises and Oberoi Realty shares dropped more than 4 percent each. Oberoi Realty on July 21 reported a net profit of Rs 421 crore for the first quarter of the financial year 2026. This marks a nearly 28 percent decline from the Rs 584 crore net profit reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year. Its revenue from operations declined around 30 percent on-year to Rs 987.55 crore, while net profit margin reduced to 39.22 percent during the quarter under review. EBITDA meanwhile stood at Rs 607 crore. Along with the Q1 results, the company also announced an interim dividend of Rs 2 per equity share for its eligible shareholders. The record date to determine the eligibility of the shareholders set to receive the payment has been set on July 25 (today), and if approved, the dividend will be paid on or before August 7. Prestige Estates and Raymond shares were down around 3 percent each, while Anant Raj, Phoenix Mills and Sobha shares were down over 2 percent each. Sobha had released its results on July 25. The firm's net profit more than doubled on an year-on-year basis to Rs 13.6 crore in Q1 FY26. However, the net profit dropped sharply from the Rs 40.86 crore reported in the previous quarter (Q4 FY25).

Noninterest income for Q1FY26 grew by 37.6% YoY (+3.8% QoQ) to INR 7,259 Mn., above our estimates, led by sharp increase in treasury gains. Annualized Net interest margin (NIM) for the quarter moderated to 6.4%, from 6.7% in Q4FY25, led by lower average yield on advances, attributed to a rising share of secured loans in the portfolio mix, a lower credit-deposit (CD) ratio, and the impact of the recent repo rate cut. Pre-Provision Operating Profits (PPoP) decreased by 14.0% YoY (+6.2% QoQ) to INR 16,684 Mn, higher than our estimates, led by lower operational expenses. The net profit declined by 65.0% YoY (+17.0% QoQ) to INR 3,720 Mn., below our estimates, led by decline in pre-provision operating profit and ~2x increase in provisions. The annualized credit cost moderated to 3.5% in Q1FY26 from 3.9% in Q4FY25, reflecting early signs of normalization in portfolio stress and disciplined provisioning practices. Outlook We have revised our FY26E/FY27E ABVPS estimates by -1.8%/-2.1%, respectively, factoring in elevated technical write-offs, persistent stress in the EEB portfolio, and anticipated near-term pressure on NIMs. We value Bandhan Bank at 1.1x Mar’27 ABVPS, implying a target price of INR 198.0 per share.

Domestic sales grew 5.5% YoY. We believe volume growth was in the low single digits. Nestle highlighted that, except for the Milk Products and Nutrition category, all other categories recorded volumeled growth. Export revenue grew 16% YoY, driven by strong performance in Foods, Coffee, Instant Tea, and Breakfast Cereals. GM contracted 250bp YoY/100bp QoQ to 55.2% (est. 57%), given the inflationary commodity prices. Management indicated that Coffee, Cocoa, and Edible Oil prices are expected to remain range-bound, while milk prices will likely cool off. EBITDA margin contracted 130bp YoY to 21.9%, the lowest in the past 12 quarters, due to elevated operating costs. We model an EBITDA margin of 23.6% for FY26 and 24.5% for FY27. Outlook The stock is trading at 69x/60x FY26/FY27 EPS. Given its expensive valuation, we reiterate our Neutral rating with a TP of INR2,400 (based on 60x P/E Jun'27E).

The company’s 1QFY26 NII grew 22% YoY to ~INR102.2b (in line). Non-interest income stood at ~INR23.8b (up 16% YoY), aided by higher income from investments in mutual funds.

Management highlighted that the CoF declined ~20bp QoQ to ~7.8%. Looking ahead, it expects a further reduction of 15-20bp, with CoF likely to settle at around ~7.6-7.65% by the end of FY26, without factoring in any additional rate cuts. This moderation in funding cost could support a slight positive bias to margins, with management guiding for ~10bp expansion in NIMs. We estimate NIM of ~9.7%/9.8% in FY26/FY27. Outlook We see limited upside catalysts due to rich valuations and a lack of near-term re-rating triggers.

Dr Reddy's prioritises branded assets for strategic acquisitions: CFO Narasimham,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/dr-reddy-s-prioritises-branded-assets-for-strategic-acquisitions-cfo-narasimham-13335332.html,"Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories' mergers and acquisitions strategy will prioritise financially sound branded assets within the pharmaceutical and consumer health segment, the company's Chief Financial Officer, M V Narasimham, told Moneycontrol. Last year's acquisition of Haleon's global NRT business (excluding the US) on September 30, 2024, for over Rs 5,000 crore, has “exceeded” expectations, with the branded business set to expand to approximately 45 percent of its total portfolio. This shift underscores a strategy that values the longevity of branded assets, which can thrive for decades over the price-erosion-prone generics business common in the US and Europe. Narasimham said the company would steer clear of new verticals like medical devices or diagnostics, focusing instead on opportunities that strategically fit its portfolio in key geographies like India, Europe, and other emerging markets. ""The top priority for capital allocation is branded businesses, followed by innovative assets,"" Narasimham said. Narasimham said the company’s acquisition principle would be to target assets whose earnings must outweigh the cost of financing the deal. ""We don't want to bother the P&Ls at this point of time, because wherever the multiples are high...we look at, okay, let it move on,"" he said. Dr. Reddy's reported revenues of Rs 8,545 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, an 11 percent increase from the Rs 7,698 crore posted in the same quarter last year. EBITDA for Q1 FY26 stood at Rs 2,278 crore, a 5 percent increase year-over-year, while net profit grew 2 percent to Rs 1,418 crore. The company ended the quarter with a net cash surplus of Rs 2,922 crore. Europe nicotine brands acquisition 'exceeding' expectations The acquisition of the Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) portfolio serves as a prime example of the company’s strategy in action. The deal has been a significant growth driver, contributing to the European business’s 142 percent year-over-year revenue surge in the first quarter. The acquired NRT business alone contributed Rs 669 crore in sales during the quarter, in a quarter that otherwise pulled down sales in North America due to the loss of exclusivity of anti-cancer generic Revlimid. Narasimham confirmed that the asset is already profitable and performing ""better than our expectations"". The integration is proceeding on schedule. Operations in the UK were integrated on May 1,  2025. Nordic countries, including Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, came into the fold on July 1, 2025. The company expects 80 percent of the NRT business's sales to be under its control by December 2025, with a full transition to be completed by March 2026. Looking ahead, Dr. Reddy’s plans to expand its newly acquired NRT portfolio into more countries once the integration is complete. Dr Reddy's  Haleon's  deal includes brands such as Nicotinell globally, and local brands like Nicabate in Australia, Thrive in Canada, and Habitrol in New Zealand and Canada. The product formats involved include lozenges, patches, and gums. The acquired business operates in over 30 countries across Europe, Asia, and Latin America. This acquisition is seen as a strategic move to expand Dr. Reddy's presence in consumer healthcare and strengthen its global OTC business with established brands. The acquired business was profitable, generating approximately GBP 217 million in revenue in 2023. The Hyderabad-based company will be launching a biosimilar in the US in partnership with German drugmaker Fresenius Kabi.  It also intends to launch future biosimilars in the US and Europe on its own, signaling greater confidence in its own commercial capabilities."

Buying in auto, pharma, and oil & gas names helped cap the downside, offering some relief after a weak start. At about noon, the Sensex was down 115.56 points or 0.14 percent at 81,347.53, and the Nifty was down 23.45 points or 0.09 percent at 24,813.55.

The prolonged uncertainty around the trade deal, coupled with the absence of strong earnings surprises, has kept investor sentiment subdued, prompting a risk-off mood across sectors,"" Devarsh Vakil, Head of Prime Research at HDFC Securities, said. Indian officials remain cautiously optimistic about the prospects of a trade agreement with the United States, even as uncertainty lingers with only a few days left before potential tariff hikes take effect. While recent deals with Japan and the European Union have raised hopes, the India-US pact continues to hang in the balance. Also read: AI anxiety or cost cuts?

The broader market mirrored the trend, as the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 dipped 0.13 percent and 0.34 percent, respectively. The Nifty IT index was down 0.63 percent. On the other hand, select defensives saw mild buying. Nifty Pharma and FMCG gained 0.60 percent and 0.57 percent, respectively. Oil & Gas and Energy indices also edged higher.

Revenue from operations remained largely flat, inching up just 0.6 percent to Rs 259 crore compared to Rs 257.4 crore in Q1FY25. Technical View ""The Nifty fell 225 points on Friday, extending its losing streak to a fourth straight week — the first such stretch since October. On the charts, Friday’s candle tested support at the lower end of a falling channel. However, the index closing below its 50-day moving average signals that bears remain in control. The pressure is likely to persist unless the Nifty breaks above the 25,245–25,340 zone. Immediate support now lies at 24,700,"" Akshay Chinchalkar, Head of Research at Axis Securities, said. Shriram Finance, Cipla, Hero MotoCorp, Tata Consumer Products, and Grasim were the top gainers on the Nifty. Laggards on the index included Kotak Mahindra Bank, Wipro, Bharti Airtel, Bharat Electronics, and Titan Company.

"Aadhar Housing hits record high after strong results, open offer by promoter Blackstone in internal transfer",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/aadhar-housing-hits-record-high-after-strong-results-open-offer-by-promoter-blackstone-in-internal-transfer-13336073.html,"Shares of Aadhar Housing Finance are higher by over 5 percent on July 28 to hit a record high, after a fund restructuring by promoter Blackstone triggered a mandatory open offer for 25.82% shares of the HFC - worth Rs 5,335 crore - at a price of Rs 469.97/share, a company filing showed. At 11:00am, the shares of Aadhar Housing Finance were higher by around 5 percent at around Rs 521 per share. The open offer is triggered following a share purchase agreement (SPA) signed on July 25, 2025, where the acquirer agreed to purchase up to 64.14% stake from existing promoter, BCP Topco VII Fund, at up to Rs 425 per share. The open offer reflects an internal transfer between Blackstone-managed funds (from BCP VII/Asia to BCP IX/Asia II), triggering a mandatory offer under Sebi regulations as they are not part of the same promoter group. This open offer will result in a continuation of Blackstone’s investment into a new fund structure, rather than an exit from the company. ""...BCP Topco VII Pte. Ltd. (“Seller”) (the promoter of Aadhar Housing Finance Limited (“Target Company”)) has entered into a share purchase agreement with BCP Asia II Holdco VII Pte. Ltd. (“Acquirer”) today i.e., 25 July 2025 (“SPA”), pursuant to which the Acquirer has agreed to acquire from the Seller up to 28,20,52,121 equity shares of the Target Company representing 64.14% of its Expanded Voting Share Capital (as defined below) at a price not exceeding Rs. 425.00 per equity share,"" the company filing said. Why The Open Offer The acquirer - BCP IX/Asia II Fund - and the seller belong to separate funds, though under the Blackstone umbrella. The Seller is a part of Blackstone Capital Partners VII fund (BCP VII) and Blackstone Capital Partners Asia fund (BCP Asia), while the acquirer is a part of Blackstone Capital Partners IX fund (BCP IX) and Blackstone Capital Partners Asia II fund (BCP Asia II). Each of these funds are managed or advised by separate affiliates of Blackstone Inc, hence the economic ownership of the seller and the acquirer lies with diversified passive partners of the relevant funds. Given the separate entities, the exemption from open offer does not apply and, accordingly, the acquirer is making this open offer. The open offer price reflects a premium to the Rs 425 per share internal transfer price, and offers liquidity to public holders. The transaction will be considered complete after the approval from RBI, National Housing Bank and CCI. June Quarter Results The company reported results over the weekend, posting a NII growth of 21.6 percent on year at Rs 428 crore along with a net profit of Rs 237 crore, which is higher by 18.6% on year. The gross non-performing assets rose marginally to 1.34 percent during June after compared to 1.31 percent of AUM a year ago. The Asset Under Management (AUM) grew by 26 percent to Rs 26,524 crore during Q1FY26. The HFC's disbursements were healthy at Rs 1,979 crore, higher by 32 percent YoY on affordable housing demand, MD and CEO Rishi Anand said. Brokerage Citi has opened a 90-day positive catalyst watch on Aadhar Housing Finance, adding to the sentiment."

Wockhardt shares rally over 5 percent after Zaynich used to treat pan-drug resistant infection,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/wockhardt-shares-rally-over-5-percent-after-zaynich-used-to-treat-pan-drug-resistant-infection-13335752.html,"Shares of Wockhardt were sharply higher by over 5 percent on July 28 after the drug company issued a statement citing a medical case involving the use of Zaynich - its novel antibiotic - in treating a critically ill US liver transplant patient who was suffering from a pan-drug resistant infection. Wockhardt shared the details of a successful use of Zaynich in treating an infection resistant to all available antibiotics in America. The case study was published in the latest issue of the Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy – AMR, a leading publication by the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, and jointly authored by US clinicians from leading hospitals - Houston Methodist Hospital, Weill Cornell Medical College and Johns Hopkins. The patient was infected with two different pathogens, both resistant to all recently-introduced antibiotics, leading to pan-drug resistance. ""Initially, the patient was treated for 10 weeks with cefiderocol and eravacycline (a novel tetracycline antibiotic), but the infection persisted, and the Pseudomonas strain became resistant to cefiderocol. The patient continued to suffer from fever and chills, and imaging tests showed new abscesses in the liver — clear signs that the infection was not under control,"" the company filing informed. Subsequently, an emergency access to Zaynich was sought, that led to encouraring results. ""The antibiotic was administered for 14 days around the time of the liver transplant. The results were remarkable - within 11 days, the patient improved clinically and transferred from ICU to regular floor, and follow-up imaging showed no signs of active infection,"" Wockhardt added. Given the risk of transplant failure due to multi-drug resistant infections, an emergency access to Zaynich was sought, and the antibiotic was administered for 14 days around the time of the liver transplant, which helped the patient recover. ""The results were remarkable - within 11 days, the patient improved clinically and transferred from ICU to regular floor, and follow-up imaging showed no signs of active infection. Importantly, the patient remained infection-free even after six weeks of completing treatment with Zaynich, making liver transplant successful and allowing doctors to safely resume chemotherapy for the underlying cancer,"" Wockhardt said."

Brokerages remained bullish on the stock, with target prices implying strong upside potential. The shares of the non-banking financial company (NBFC) were trading at Rs 2,018 apiece, as seen at 9.30 am. Bajaj Finserv Q1 Results: Bajaj Finserv on July 25 (Friday) had reported a net profit of Rs 2,789 crore for Q1 FY26. This marked a 30.5 percent rise from the Rs 2,138 crore net profit reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year. The company's revenue from operations stood at Rs 35,439.08 crore in the quarter under review, marking a year-on-year (YoY) jump of 12.5 percent from Rs 31,479.93 crore reported in the corresponding quarter of previous year. On a sequential basis, the profit after tax (PAT) surged 15 percent from Rs 2,416.64 crore reported by the company in Q4 FY25. However, the revenue declined 3 percent from Rs 36,595.36 crore in the January-March quarter. Should you buy, sell or hold? JM Financial kept a ‘Buy’ call on the stock, but raised its target price to Rs 2,300 apiece (earlier Rs 2,250 apiece). The latest target price implies an upside potential of nearly 16 percent from the stock’s previous closing price of Rs 1,985.80 apiece. The domestic brokerage said that it expects the company to return to steady growth by the second half of this year. It added that it appreciates the firm’s reset in product and cost structures. “At CMP, while the implied holdco discount of 17% is less than 5 year average of 21%, we prefer Bajaj Finserv over Bajaj Finance to play the Bajaj growth story,” it added.

"Tata Motors, Samvardhana, Bharat Forge rise up to 2% on US-European Union trade deal",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/tata-motors-samvardhana-bharat-forge-rise-up-to-2-on-us-european-union-trade-deal-13335396.html,"Shares of Tata Motors, Samvardhana Motherson, Sona BLW, and Bharat Forge gained up to 2 percent each on July 28 as investors cheered a sweeping US-European Union trade deal that is expected to lower tariff barriers and boost automotive exports. The US on Sunday evening unveiled a landmark trade agreement with the EU that standardises tariffs across most product categories at 15 percent. The move marks a significant shift from the existing 27.5 percent duty on car imports from the EU and comes just days ahead of President Donald Trump’s August 1 tariff deadline. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates The deal, which follows a similar agreement with Japan last week, is expected to ease trade frictions and could offer a competitive edge to several Indian companies with deep linkages to the US and EU auto ecosystems. Tata Motors rose 1.6 percent as analysts flagged potential benefits to Jaguar Land Rover, which exports a substantial portion of its US-bound vehicles from Slovakia, an EU member. The reduced tariff rate is likely to offer cost advantages, especially with nearly a third of JLR’s volumes headed to the US. Shares of Samvardhana Motherson climbed 1.3 percent. The company supplies components to OEMs in Germany and Mexico that cater to the US market, which accounts for roughly 6 to 7 percent of its consolidated revenue. The easing of tariffs could translate into smoother trade flows and potentially higher volumes. Also read: Not cutting jobs because of AI, says TCS CEO Krithivasan on 2% workforce layoff plans Sona BLW advanced 1.3 percent on the day. With 43 percent of its revenue coming from the US, the company stands to gain meaningfully from a more predictable and favourable tariff regime. Bharat Forge gained 1 percent, buoyed by the prospect of stronger export momentum. The US accounts for 35 to 40 percent of its standalone exports, and a friendlier trade environment could drive incremental demand for its products. At about 9:45 am, Nifty Auto was trading at 23,898, higher by 0.5 percent from the last close on the NSE. Nifty Auto has gained over 7 percent in the last 6 months.

While a truce has been reached between the US-EU and the US-Japan, a deal with India is taking longer than initially anticipated. At open, Kotak Mahindra Bank and TCS led the losses.

""Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) pulled out Rs 13,552 crore from the cash market last week, further dragging sentiment. Meanwhile, Q1 earnings so far have lacked any meaningful upside surprises, reinforcing the cautious mood,"" he added. At market open on July 28, sectoral trends were mixed across the NSE indices. The Nifty IT index led the laggards, slipping 1.03 percent, weighed down by weak sentiment in large-cap tech stocks. Private banks also came under pressure, with the Nifty Private Bank index down 0.92 percent, while the broader Nifty Bank declined 0.23 percent.

Going ahead, cost optimisation and AI-led productivity will drive most deal wins, and firms that are unable to gain market-share will have to resort to layoffs. Shares of Shriram Finance rose 1 percent after the company posted a strong set of numbers for the first quarter of FY26. Standalone net profit rose 9 percent year-on-year to Rs 2,156 crore, while net interest income (NII) grew 12.6 percent to Rs 6,026 crore. HSBC, Jefferies, Nuvama, and Motilal Oswal have given bullish ratings on the stock. Shares of private lender Kotak Mahindra slipped 7 percent after the bank's net profit took a 7 percent tumble. Kotak Mahindra Bank reported a standalone net profit of Rs 3,282 crore for Q1 FY26, marking a 7 percent year-on-year decline from Rs 3,520 crore in the same period last year. Going ahead, international brokerage Bernstein believes that the surge in credit costs and soft asset quality will continue to weigh on Kotak Mahindra Bank’s valuation.

The tone for early next week remains negative as put writers are likely to continue repositioning at lower levels. Index has convincingly slipped below its 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), currently placed at 24,950, which had previously offered strong support. This level will now act as immediate resistance. A sustained close below 24,800 could further accelerate the selling momentum, dragging the index toward the 24,600–24,500 zone. Tata Motors, Shriram Finance, Bajaj Finserv, Hero MotoCorp, and Maruti Suzuki were the top gainers on the Nifty. Laggards on the index included Kotak Mahindra Bank, TCS, Bharti Airtel, Titan Company, and Jio Financial Services.
