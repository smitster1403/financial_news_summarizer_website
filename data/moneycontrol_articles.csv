Broader indices outperform; these small caps rose 10-22%,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/broader-indices-outperform-these-small-caps-rose-10-22-13297647.html,"The broader indices outperformed the main indices with a gain of 1-1.5 percent amid volatility led by uncertainties in trade agreement with the US, tepid corporate earnings, persistent FII selling, better domestic macro data, and above normal monsoon. Among broader indices, the large-cap index extended the fall in the third consecutive week as it fell 0.5 percent. However, mid and small-cap indices erased previous week losses, gaining 1 percent and 1.5 percent, respectively. For the week, the BSE Sensex index shed 742.74 points or 0.90 percent to close at 81,757.73, and Nifty50 fell 181.45 points or 0.72 percent to close at 24,968.40. However, in this month till now, Sensex and Nifty declined 2 percent each. The Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their selling in the third week, as they sold equities worth Rs 6671.57 crore; however, Domestic Institutional Investors (DII) extended their buying in the 13th week as they purchased equities worth Rs 9,490.54 crore. In this month till now, FII sold equities worth Rs 16,955.75 crore, while DII bought equities worth Rs 21,893.52 crore. On the sectoral level, the BSE Bank index fell 1.3 percent, the BSE Information Technology index shed 1.2 percent, BSE Capital Goods index shed 1 percent. On the other hand, the BSE Realty index added 3.7 percent, BSE Auto index rose 1.7 percent. ""Domestic equity markets continued their protracted correction for the 3rd consecutive week and ended below the psychological level of 25k, weighed down by the broadly tepid start of Q1FY26 earnings, particularly from the IT and financial sectors. The IT sector remained under strain due to muted performance and cautious outlooks amid global demand uncertainty, while financials are also expected to report subdued results due to expected NIM contraction and asset quality concerns. In contrast, FMCG stocks outperformed, supported by encouraging growth guidance that points to a possible revival in urban consumption trends. Improved earnings momentum supported by macroeconomic tailwinds can shift investor preferences towards consumption stocks,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments. ""On the global front, markets are closely monitoring the outcome of the proposed US-India mini trade agreement. A favourable resolution could strengthen the outlook for export-oriented sectors and enhance India’s relative attractiveness among emerging markets. Meanwhile, the continued moderation in inflation has bolstered expectations of an additional rate cut, which, if materialised, would be supportive of market sentiment. As the earnings season progresses, quarterly updates from index heavyweights will be closely monitored. Strong earnings growth is vital to justify India's premium valuations,"" he added. The BSE Small-cap index rose 1.5 percent with LE Travenues Technology (IXIGO), Igarashi Motors, Navkar Corporation, John Cockerill India, Neuland Laboratories, Anand Rathi Wealth, Platinum Industries, Tilaknagar Industries, Sportking India, Allcargo Terminals, Godavari Biorefineries, Ashapura Minechem rising 15-22 percent.  Where is Nifty50 headed? Amol Athawale, VP-technical Research, Kotak Securities In the last week, the benchmark indices witnessed profit booking at higher levels. On weekly charts, it has formed a bearish candle, which is largely negative. We believe that the short-term market texture is weak, but a fresh sell-off is possible only after the dismissal of 24,900/81600. Below this level, the market is likely to retest the levels of 24,600–24,500/80700-80400. On the flip side, the 50-day SMA (Simple Moving Average) or 25,050/82100 and 25,100/82300 would act as crucial resistance zones for short-term traders. If the market manages to trade above 25,100/82300, it could bounce back to the 20-day SMA or 25,320/83000. Further upside potential could lift the index up to 25,450–25,500/83400-83600. For Bank Nifty, the 50-day SMA or 56,000 would act as a key support zone, while the 20-day SMA or 56,900 could serve as a crucial resistance area for the bulls. Below 56,900, it could slip to 56,500–56,150, while above 56,900, it could move up to 57,365–57,600. The Nifty remained under selling pressure, falling towards 24,900, where it found initial support. The index stayed above the 50-day exponential moving average (50EMA) and appears poised for a short-term pullback after a sharp correction. However, it remains a ‘sell on rise’ as long as it trades below 25,260. On the downside, selling may intensify if it breaks below 24,900. Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities A reasonable negative candle was formed on the daily chart on Friday, which indicates an attempt of a downside breakout of the immediate support. The bullish chart pattern with higher tops and bottoms seems to have been negated, and we observe the beginning of a bearish chart pattern, with lower tops and bottoms formation on the daily chart. The recent swing high of 25255 could now be considered as a new lower top of the pattern. Nifty on the weekly chart formed a reasonable negative candle this week, which is the third consecutive bearish candle formation in a row. The previous sharp upside breakout of the larger range movement of last month has been negated, and the market slipped below the crucial support zone of the 25000 mark. The underlying trend of Nifty remains weak. A slide below 24900 levels could open more weakness down to 24500 in the coming week. However, any pullback rally from here could find strong overhead resistance around 25250.

SEBI nod for Jane Street’s trading comeback still awaited,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sebi-nod-for-jane-street-s-trading-comeback-still-awaited-13296538.html,"A week after Jane Street deposited Rs 4,843.5 crore in compliance with SEBI’s July 3 order, trading restrictions on the global quant firm remain, as exchanges are yet to receive a formal instruction from SEBI to lift the ban. A SEBI source said the lifting of the trading ban is “only a procedural aspect,” and there is no deliberate effort on part of the regulator to go back on its own directives. “Usually, the process involves checking lien documents on impounded assets. That’s the usual procedure. There is no other reason,” said the source familiar with the development. The July 3 interim order had directed Jane Street to deposit what SEBI termed “unlawful gains” into an escrow account. It had also stated clearly that the various restrictions—including those under Clause 62.2 restraining the firm from trading—would cease upon successful deposit of this amount. Related directives to banks, depositories, custodians, registrars, and transfer agents would also be lifted. However, Clause 62.13 of the same order directed stock exchanges to “closely monitor all future dealings and positions of the Jane Street Group on an ongoing basis” to ensure the entities do not, directly or indirectly, engage in any manipulative activity, including trading using any patterns identified in the order, until SEBI’s investigation and any subsequent proceedings are complete. While SEBI’s directive takes into account the role of stock exchanges as the first line of regulatory oversight, the talk in broking circles is about the feasibility of exchanges detecting and calling out manipulation and the trading patterns illustrated by Sebi in its order. Further guidance from SEBI is likely to be key in resolving this—something traders would expect from the regulator for added comfort. An email seeking SEBI’s comment on the matter remained unanswered. Moneycontrol had first reported on July 14 that Jane Street had deposited the Rs 4,843.5 crore in a separate escrow account, with lien marked in SEBI’s favor. SEBI confirmed the same in a press statement on Monday. Market participants had expected SEBI to issue directions to exchanges and market infrastructure institutions once the funds were deposited. However, SEBI’s press note of July 14 on Jane Street added that “They have further stated that this action has been undertaken by them without prejudice to their rights and remedies which remain available to them in law and equity”. Jane Street has since requested SEBI to lift the “conditional restrictions” imposed under the interim order and to issue appropriate directions. SEBI has said the matter is under examination in accordance with the order. The July 3 order had also directed the firm to “cease and desist” from any fraudulent, manipulative or unfair trade practice—directly or indirectly—that would violate SEBI’s regulations, including use of any patterns cited in the order. SEBI had alleged that Jane Street manipulated the market by taking cash and futures positions in constituent stocks of an index in one direction in the morning, creating an illusion of bullishness, and then taking opposite positions in index derivatives in the afternoon. SEBI described this as “deceptive and manipulative,” though Jane Street has denied the allegations. Also read: Criminal prosecution against Jane Street?

"Rare earth crisis draws PMO's attention, GMDC shares up 13% ahead of stakeholder meeting",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/pmo-likely-to-hold-meeting-on-rare-earth-magnet-crisis-with-key-stakeholders-gmdc-shares-rally-13294480.html,"Shares of PSU mining major Gujarat Mineral Development Corporation (GMDC) were sharply higher by 13 percent on July 18, after reports emerged that PMO is likely to hold a key stakeholder meeting on the rare-earth magnet crisis. Tracking the news, shares of Orissa Minerals Development Company (OMDC) too ended higher by over 8 percent. GMDC has stated intentions of entering the critical mineral space, including rare earth, and the company has been working towards this, through it has not officially disclosed details of its plans yet. The management consider rare earths as a 'value driver', as the material goes into the making permanent magnets, used in the electric vehicle supply chain. The company said in May that it has allocated approximately Rs 3,000-4,000 crore for critical mineral projects, without elaborating on further details. The electronics industry has written to the government, flagging off ‘informal sanctions’ by China on rare earth supplies and equipment, which the players believe could put the export-linked smartphone manufacturing under ‘serious risk’, CNBC-TV18 reported separately. During May and June, few automakers had flagged off risks of production, if the restricted supplies of rare earth magnet from China were not quickly restored. Magnets formed out of rare earth elements (REEs) are crucial for the automotive sector, especially electric vehicles (EVs), as well as for in the renewable energy space. To address automakers' concerns, the Centre is considering a possible relaxation of localisation norms, allowing the import of fully-built motors, newspaper Mint reported on July 18. Acknowledging this, Heavy Industries Minister HD Kumaraswamy had recently said that the Centre is working on addressing the rare earth supply issue. ""We are working on it,"" the minister had said last month. An incentive scheme for rare earth magnets too is likely being considered, in order to subsidise the domestic processing of the minerals, news reports said, quoting government officials. ""A scheme has been circulated for Rs 1,345 crore subsidy for manufacturers of rare earth magnets. It is currently under inter-ministerial consultation. It is proposed that there will be two manufacturers as of now, however this could change by the time the scheme is ready,"" Kumaraswamy had said. In June, NSA Ajit Doval and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi met in Beijing on the sideline of a SCO meeting, and reviewed bilateral relations, underscoring the need to promote an overall development. Commerce Secretary Sunil Barthwal confirmed that India is engaged with China on the issue of rare earth minerals supply, ensuring all efforts to seek uninterrupted imports. In light of China's restricted exports of rare earth elements, GMDC may emerge as a key alternative supplier. Aside of GMDC, among listed players, NMDC, Coal India, Hindustan Zinc, Vedanta, and MOIL are potential leaders in India’s rare earth ambition, and the Centre has auctioned four blocks of strategic minerals this year, though only one is focused entirely on rare earths."

""On the technical front, the market formed a bearish candle on the daily chart and a lower top on the intraday chart, signalling continued selling pressure and a negative bias. As long as Nifty/Sensex stays below 25,255/ 82,700, sentiment is expected to remain weak,"" Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities said. ""Immediate support lies at the 50-day Simple Moving Average—25,000 for the Nifty and 82,000 for the Sensex. A breach below these levels could open the door to further downside toward 24,900–24,850 and 81,600–81,500, respectively,"" he added. Wipro, Bajaj Finance, Tata Steel, ONGC, and Nestle were the top gainers on the Nifty.

"Waaree Energies, Premier Energies, SW Solar shares fall up to 4% as US firms request tariffs on imports from India",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/waaree-energies-premier-energies-sw-solar-shares-fall-up-to-4-as-us-firms-request-tariffs-on-imports-from-india-13295119.html,"The shares of Indian solar module manufacturers dropped in trade on July 18, after their US peers filed new trade petitions against India, Indonesia and Laos, seeking more anti-dumping and countervailing duties on the imports to US. The Alliance for American Solar Manufacturing and Trade accused these companies of dumping cheap goods in the market to undercut new American factories. The group includes Tempe, Arizona-based First Solar, Qcells, the solar division of Korea's Hanwha, and private companies Talon PV and Mission Solar. The American firms have accused their foreign rivals of receiving unfair government subsidies and selling their products below the cost of production in US, hampering the home-grown companies there. ""We have always said, vigorous enforcement of our trade laws is critical to the success of this industry,"" Tim Brightbill, lead attorney for the petitioners, said in a statement. Notably, most of the solar panels installed in US are made overseas. Indian solar panel makers derive a major portion of their revenue from US exports. If the petitions are accepted, the margins of these Indian players may be hampered. Waaree Energies shares dropped around 2.5 percent to trade at Rs 3,127 apiece. Premier Energies shares meanwhile fell nearly 1.4 percent to trade at Rs 1,065 apiece. Sterling and Wilson Renewable Energy (SW Solar) shares meanwhile tumbled over 4 percent to trade at Rs 321 apiece. Notably, this comes a day after the company released its results for the first quarter of the financial year 2026. SW Solar had reported a net profit of Rs 31 crore for Q1 FY26, marking a multi fold jump from the Rs 4 crore net profit reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year. Revenue from operations also more than doubled in a year to Rs 1,762 crore.

Growth in cables and wires is led by higher government expenditure, better project execution and superior revenue mix. Cables continued to outpace wires. Additionally, its international business revenues grew 24% YoY. (2) Fans segment saw a muted performance due to unseasonal rainfall; however, solar products’ growth doubled YoY. (3) EBIT margin expansion is supported by a move towards premium products and operating leverage. (4) We model the ongoing infrastructure/ capex cycle to continue to create multiple growth opportunities. Increase in manufacturing of electronics as well as backward integration also creates additional tailwinds. (5) Sustained profitability of FMEG business also augurs well for long term EVA creation.

Buy Axis Bank; target of Rs 1370: ICICI Securities,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-axis-bank-target-of-rs-1370-icici-securities-13294764.html,"ICICI Securities research report on Axis Bank Axis Bank (Axis) reported disappointing Q1FY26 with a massive rise in gross/net slippages and credit costs. Axis, in its Q4FY25 call, without quantifying, had mentioned that it has tightened the upgrade and classification criteria (technical impact), which could adversely impact asset quality outcomes. The technical impact on gross slippages (INR 27.1bn), net slippages (INR 18.6bn) and credit costs (INR 8bn) is: 1) higher than our estimates; and more importantly 2) difficult to comprehend, in our view. Gross/net slippages jumped to ~3.1%/2.3% annualised, while credit costs spiked to 1.5%. RoA moderated to 1.5%, cushioned by treasury/fee and muted opex. NIM declined ~17bps QoQ to 3.8% and the bank retains its ‘through the cycle’ guidance of 3.8%. Axis now aims for outpacing the industry on loan growth in FY26 and continued muted opex in the near term. Retain BUY on valuations. Outlook We cut our target multiple to ~1.65x (~1.8x earlier); TP revised to INR 1,370 (INR 1,470 earlier). Maintain BUY on valuations, though we believe that the stock’s returns are likely to be back-ended. Axis has seen higher churn at the senior level and we hope the bank addresses this before it starts impacting execution.

Buy Indian Hotels; target of Rs 941: ICICI Securities,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-indian-hotels-target-of-rs-941-icici-securities-13294767.html,"ICICI Securities research report on Indian Hotels Indian Hotels (IH IN) reported Q1FY26 consolidated revenue of INR 20.4bn and EBITDA of INR 5.8bn (2% above I-sec estimate of INR5.7bn) driven by higher standalone ARR of INR 14,552 (up 12% YoY). The resilient Q1FY26 performance, which saw demand being impacted by domestic/international geopolitical factors, augurs well for the remainder of FY26. We believe that with industry tailwinds of demand continuing to outpace supply over FY25-29E, the company’s goal of doubling revenue by 2030 assuming high single-digit RevPAR growth is realistic and achievable (I-sec estimate of 8% standalone RevPAR CAGR over FY25-27E). Outlook We retain our BUY rating with a revised SoTP-based TP of INR 941 (earlier: INR 979) owing to a marginal cut in subsidiary level FY26/27E EBITDA of 2–3%, retaining Mar’27E EV/EBITDA multiple of 33x.

Buy HDFC Asset Management Company; target of Rs 5700: Prabhudas Lilladher,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-hdfc-asset-management-company-target-of-rs-5700-prabhudas-lilladher-13294409.html,"Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on HDFC Asset Management Company HDFCAMC saw a strong quarter as core income was 1.8% more than PLe due to revenue being 2.7% higher. Revenue yields were better at 46.7bps (PLe 45.5bps) as (1) equity mix improved QoQ to 60.3% from 59.9% due to equity market bounce back in Q1FY26 (2) commission rationalization and (3) likely more flows in higher yielding older AuM. Strong equity performance in the 3-yr bucket is driving net flows’ market share of 15.0% in Q1FY26. Due to new ESOP scheme of 2.5mn shares, we raise staff cost for FY26/27E by 2%/4%. Although a bit volatile initially, equity markets have delivered strong returns in Q1FY26 while industry equity flows have improved to Rs314bn in Jun’25 from Rs272bn in Mar’25. Outlook Owing to strong MTM impact of 10.1% in Q1FY26 CLAuM and uptick in flows, we raise core EPS for FY26/27E by avg. 4.2%, increase multiple to 42x from 35x and raise TP to Rs5,700 from Rs4,600.

The sharp fall in the share prices pushed the Nifty India Defence index down around 2.2 percent to hover around 8,173 in the afternoon. The defence index has now extended losses to the third consecutive session. It has recorded decline in six out of seven straight sessions. The defence stocks saw significant rally earlier this year, but analysts now flag high valuations. The shares of the companies came in focus on hopes of higher order inflows, after the Indian military conducted targeted strikes against terrorist outfits in Pakistan under the codename 'Operation Sindoor' in May. As the geopolitical tensions between India and Pakistan eased, the escalations in Russia-Ukraine war continued to support the rally in defence stocks. The rise in tensions between Israel and Iran further boosted the stocks. However, as geopolitical tensions around the globe continue to ease, the defence stocks declined. Bharat Dynamics (BDL) and Data Patterns shares were the top losers on the index, falling nearly 5 percent and over 4 percent respectively. BEML and Astra Microwave Products shares fell over 3 percent each. Cochin Shipyard and Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) shares followed, declining over 2 percent each, while Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders, Bharat Electronics (BEL) and Solar Industries shares fell more than 1.5 percent each. Paras Defence and Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers (GRSE) shares fell more than 1 percent each.

Buy Marico; target of Rs 810: Emkay Global Financial,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-marico-target-of-rs-810-emkay-global-financial-2-13294324.html,"Emkay Global Financial' research report on Marico However, the company’s near-term performance is likely to be impacted by the inflationary copra prices in both, India and Indonesia. Amid unprecedented surge in copra prices, Marico’s nearterm margin in India (1/3rd of revenue) and in Bangladesh (3/5th of revenue) is likely to be stressed. However, we expect cyclical pressures to ebb with improvement in market supplies in coming months, in line with management expectations. We uphold our expectations of a margin recovery in 2H, wherein the company is likely to manage growth with better volumes and improved margins; this would lead to double-digit earnings growth. We see risk to our margin and growth assumptions for FY26E, if the copra price inflation persists. Outlook We maintain our long-term positive view on Marico with Jun-26E TP of Rs810 (on 50x P/E), given improved execution.

Adjusted for this technical impact, 1Q PAT is likely log at ~Rs64bn. Though the management had earlier given guidance for this policy change to ensure industry-best prudency, the extent of NPA formation is higher than expected. The management indicated that 1Q bore the impact of the stock plus flow, and so slippages during 9MFY26 should be relatively moderate (albeit elevated), as also the credit cost. Factoring this in, we cut FY26E/FY27E/FY28E earnings by 7%/3%/1%; we expect the RoA to dip to 1.6% in FY26E and gradually recover to 1.7%. The stock has already corrected recently and is trading at cheap valuations of 1.4x FY27E ABV/1.2x FY28E ABV. Outlook Hence, we retain BUY on Axis while maintaining our TP at Rs1,400, rolling forward the standalone bank valuation on 1.6x Jun-27E ABV and subs at Rs125/sh.

IT Services revenue declined 0.3% QoQ to USD2.59bn (down 2% CC), in line with our expectations. Overall EBITM declined by 120bps QoQ due to one-off restructuring costs of ~Rs2.5bn in Europe, missing our estimates, while EBITM for IT Services matched our expectations. Deal intake remained strong at ~USD5bn in Q1 (includes large-deal bookings worth ~USD2.7bn), with book-to-bill of 1.9x. The management gave revenue growth guidance of -1% to 1% CC QoQ in Q2, in line with our estimates. While macro and geopolitical uncertainty remains elevated, the management is confident of growth acceleration in H2 on the back of strong deal intake, robust deal pipeline, and improved execution rigor. The management indicated pressure on margins in the near term due to anticipated ramp up of competitively-priced large deals and initial investments in such deals, although it refrained from quantifying the overall impact. We prefer to wait for clarity on the margin trajectory before taking a more constructive view. Outlook We trim FY26-28E EPS by ~1%, factoring in the Q1 performance; retain REDUCE with TP of Rs280 at 20x Jun-27E EPS.

Broader selling was also seen across insurance and NBFC stocks. Shares of Axis Bank slipped as much as 6.36 percent to Rs 1,086 on the NSE after the private lender reported a 3 percent year-on-year drop in its consolidated net profit to Rs 6,243.72 crore for the first quarter of FY26. The decline was attributed to changes in norms related to non-performing assets and loan upgrade policies.

Buy Axis Bank; target of Rs 1375: Prabhudas Lilladher,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-axis-bank-target-of-rs-1375-prabhudas-lilladher-13294073.html,"Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Axis Bank AXSB saw a weak quarter yet again as core PAT missed PLe by 26.6% due to asset quality related technical impact of Rs6.14bn. Adjusting for the same, core PAT missed PLe by 17% owing to lower NIM and fees. Owing to more stringent recognition criteria, gross slippages were more by Rs27.1bn (one-time impact). In our view, this may also reflect the underlying stress. As bank does not intend to further change the recognition policy, upcoming quarters of FY26 and FY27 would see lower credit costs since stress is moderating in PL/CC. Outlook We raise provisions for FY26 by 8bps but reduce it for FY27E by 3bps. For FY26/27E, we cut NIM by 6bps and trim fees by avg. ~2.0%; core PAT is lower by 5.1%/2.6%. Due to 7bps reduction in core RoA for FY26 to 1.4%, we tweak multiple to 1.8x from 1.9x and cut TP to Rs1,375 from Rs1,500. Retain ‘BUY’.

For the June quarter, Clean Science’s revenue rose 8 percent year-on-year to Rs 240 crore, while Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) grew 5 percent over the same period to Rs 100 crore. Margins for the quarter contracted by 100 basis points to 41.7 percent compared to 42.8 percent a year ago, while net profit increased by 6 percent year-on-year. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog Over 25 percent of the company’s revenue during the quarter came from newer product launches, and the management noted that the company also gained market share in this period. However, the company revised its EBITDA growth guidance to 15–18 percent (down from the earlier 18–20 percent) citing softness in the first quarter of FY26 and global headwinds. Management said it expects a stronger ramp-up starting Q3FY26, with revenue acceleration in the second half of FY26 driven by new product launches, improved capacity utilisation, operating leverage, and market expansion. The promoters of Clean Science, who currently hold a 74.97 percent stake in the company, are evaluating the sale of a minority stake as part of their family estate planning and management, the management shared during the earnings call. Motilal Oswal reiterated its ""neutral"" rating on the stock, with a target price of Rs 1,350 per share. The brokerage cut its FY26 and FY27 estimates by 9 percent each, citing higher tax rates, but expects a revenue, EBITDA, and PAT CAGR of 23 percent, 23 percent, and 27 percent, respectively, over FY25–27. Meanwhile, HDFC Securities maintained a ""sell"" rating with a target price of Rs 1,029 per share. The brokerage said it expects the return on equity (RoE) to remain around 20 percent and EPS to grow at an 18 percent CAGR between FY25 and FY29. HDFC Securities noted that valuations remain high at 48x and 41x FY26 and FY27 estimated EPS, respectively. It added that Q1 EBITDA was 8 percent below its estimates, while PAT was 9 percent below expectations due to lower-than-expected revenue.

The sequential dip in topline was due to lower sales of newer products such as DCC and TBHQ. The Pharma & Agro Intermediates segment witnessed the sharpest decline, with revenue down 32% QoQ. Volume for the company’s established products remained strong, supporting a robust standalone EBITDAM of 46%, driven by lower raw material costs. HALS volume stood at 540tn. The management reiterated its guidance of 4,500tn for HALS volume in FY26, with new HALS grades priced at USD11–35/kg expected to be launched over the coming quarters. HALS is likely to break even at the EBITDA level by Q2FY26, with monthly sales expected to reach Rs100mn. The HALS subsidiary reported EBITDA loss of Rs80mn in Q1FY26. On the capex front, water trials at Performance Chemicals 1 are scheduled for Aug’25, with commercialization of the facility targeted for Sep. Performance Chemicals 2 is on track for commercialization in Q4FY26. Looking ahead, these new capacity additions are expected to be key growth drivers. Outlook However, the company’s margin profile may face some pressure, as certain new products such as HALS are expected to yield lower profitability compared to the legacy portfolio. At its current valuation of 41x FY27 EPS, we maintain ‘HOLD’ rating on CLEAN, with target price of Rs1,425 valuing it at 40x FY27 EPS.

The growth performance in Consumer and BFS (beyond CAPCO) was weak. The discretionary budgets were tight in Consumer and Manufacturing, especially in Europe, otherwise AI-led transformation and modernization of data witnessed steady recover in Q1. The exceptional large deal TCV (including 2 mega deals) is a mix of both renewals and NN. The large wins are a strategic outcome of securing the existing books while building new offerings on top. However, the nature of the deals is concentrated more on the vendor consolidation and cost optimization side, which ideally comes at a higher tenure and lower margins. The early part of the deals would require investments in right sizing the talent base and setting up stage for deployment, which ultimately leads to take a hit on the margins. We expect the ramp up of two mega deals to support growth in H2, while also considering the underlying weakness and slower conversion. We are revising our estimates to -1.5%/+3.4 YoY CC (vs -2.5%/2.9% earlier), while cutting our margin estimates by 30/40bps for FY26E/FY27E to 16.9%/17.1%.

Hold LTIMindtree; target of Rs 5340: Prabhudas Lilladher,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/hold-ltimindtree-target-of-rs-5340-prabhudas-lilladher-13293833.html,"Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on LTIMindtree The revenue growth was broadly in line to our estimates of 0.8% QoQ CC, partly aided by a ramp up of a large deal ($450m) within Retail segment. The deal is expected to see further ramp up and achieve its full potential as it progresses through Q2. Surprisingly, the management remained cautious on BFS, hinting to account-specific weakness, rather than an industry-wide challenge. The growth performance of CMT (1.1% QoQ) and Manufacturing (0.4% QoQ) was also weak vs Consol business growth of 2% QoQ in USD. We believe the large deal ramp up would support the growth in the rest of the year, while we are also cognizant of the fact of the underlying demand weakness. Hence the growth beyond the scope of large deal would be limited. The askrate for a similar growth (FY25) in FY26 would be ~2% CQGR, which we believe is achievable, given the order inflows were elevated while rate of conversion remains stable. We are baking in CC revenue growth of 4.8% and 8.2% YoY in FY26E/FY27E, while keeping our margins unchanged. With that our EPS sees an upgrade of ~2% in FY26E/FY27E. We assign PE of 27x to FY27 EPS, valuations are largely capped. Retain HOLD. Outlook We are factoring in a USD revenue and earnings CAGR of 7% and 13%, respectively. The stock is currently trading at 26x its FY27E earnings, and we assign a target PE of 27x FY27E earnings to arrive at a target price of INR 5,340.

Markets are in Ajit’s ‘Liquid Oxygen’ state: Kotak's Pratik Gupta,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/markets-are-in-ajit-s-liquid-oxygen-state-kotak-s-pratik-gupta-13293609.html,"Equity markets are caught in a tight band—unable to rise meaningfully or fall sharply—much like Bollywood villain Ajit’s famous ""liquid oxygen"" trap, said Pratik Gupta, Co-head and CEO at Kotak Institutional Equities, in an interview with CNBC-TV18 this morning. Agarwal recalled Ajit’s classic cult dialogue: “Mona Darling, isko liquid oxygen mein daal do. Liquid isko jeene nahin dega, oxygen isko marne nahin dega” (Put him in liquid oxygen. The liquid won’t let him live, the oxygen won’t let him die), to illustrate the market’s current dilemma. Tepid earnings growth and a steady supply of new equity paper are capping the upside, while strong domestic flows continue to cushion the downside, he said. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates While near-term sentiment remains cautious, there is still hope pinned on a recovery in earnings during the second half of the financial year, he added. At present, market valuations remain elevated, with the Nifty trading at around 22 times forward earnings, levels that are considered expensive by historical standards. Earnings growth has been tepid across key sectors such as IT, consumer goods, and banking, all of which are expected to post single-digit growth for the full year. Also read: Fund Manager Survey: Sentiment turns most bullish since 2024; India slips to fourth rank in Asia, according to BoFA Despite the weak first-half performance on the cards, Pratik expects earnings momentum to pick up meaningfully in the second half, supported by festive demand, margin tailwinds from easing input costs, and an uptick in government-led capital expenditure. Overall, full-year earnings growth is still projected at around 11 percent. A few key triggers could help support sentiment and improve the outlook, including a potential trade deal with the US, a reduction in retail-level petrol and diesel prices, and tweaks to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime.

The company’s revenue came in at INR 1,70,587 Mn. (- 6.4% QoQ /+20.5% YoY), below our estimates, mainly due to regional consolidation and weak palm oil sales. The growth was primarily driven by edible oils and industry essentials. Outlook We upgrade our “REDUCE” rating on AWL to “HOLD” owing to the improved visibility on edible oil volume recovery, driven by palm oil price correction, and favorable import duty structure.

Over the past five trading days, the stock of this real estate company has gained 6 percent, compared with a 0.5 percent decline in the benchmark Nifty 50 index. The company said it acquired the 48-acre land parcel in the Doddaballapur micro-market of North Bengaluru. Godrej Properties added that the site is located near the Satellite Town Ring Road (STRR). The development on this land will primarily consist of plotted units, with an estimated development potential of around 1.1 million square feet. This acquisition follows the company’s announcement earlier this week of a 50-acre residential land deal in Raipur. The Raipur property, situated close to central Raipur, the railway station, Swami Vivekananda Airport, and the upcoming Raipur–Hyderabad and Raipur–Visakhapatnam expressways, will be developed into a premium plotted residential project with an estimated saleable area of approximately 9.5 lakh square feet. Last month, Godrej Properties reported sales worth over Rs 2,000 crore during the launch of the first phase of Barca at Godrej MSR City in Devanahalli, Bengaluru. Also last month, the company announced another acquisition in Pune, acquiring 16 acres in the Upper Kharadi locality. This project, located near IT hubs such as Viman Nagar, Magarpatta, and Hadapsar, is expected to generate revenue of around Rs 3,100 crore.

"LTIMindtree shares fall 2% after in-line Q1 results, brokerages share mixed stance",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/ltimindtree-shares-fall-2-after-in-line-q1-results-brokerages-share-mixed-stance-13293435.html,"Shares of LTIMindtree fell over 2 percent to Rs 5,078 apiece on July 18 after the company posted an in-line set of results for the April-June quarter (Q1FY26). While brokerages maintained their ratings on the stock following the Q1 numbers, they indicated limited upside from current levels. Morgan Stanley, which has an ""Equal-weight"" rating with a target price of Rs 5,400, noted that the management expects to sustain both growth and margin momentum. However, the brokerage felt that the commentary could have been more bullish if macroeconomic conditions were more supportive. Morgan Stanley added that LTIMindtree’s limited earnings per share (EPS) changes compared to peers is a positive sign. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog Global brokerage HSBC maintained its ""Buy"" rating and raised the target price to Rs 6,000 from Rs 5,900 earlier. HSBC said the Q1 performance was broadly in line with expectations and reflected continued improvement in the company’s fundamentals. Over the medium to long term, it expects LTIMindtree’s growth to be nearly double that of mega-cap IT companies, with scope for strong growth acceleration at still-attractive valuations. Nuvama also reiterated its ""Buy"" rating and sharply increased its target price to Rs 6,200 from Rs 5,200. The brokerage believes LTIMindtree occupies a unique position — trading below the expensive, high-growth Tier-2 IT firms and above the cheaper, low-growth Tier-1 firms. According to Nuvama, this places the company in a sweet spot for “growth at a reasonable valuation” with a favourable risk-reward profile. On the other hand, Nomura maintained a ""Neutral"" rating with a target price of Rs 5,040. It highlighted improving growth visibility but added that FY26 is likely to be a “year of repair” and accounted for a slightly higher tax rate in its forecasts. For the June quarter, LTIMindtree reported a 10.6 percent rise in net profit to Rs 1,254.1 crore. Revenue from operations increased 7.6 percent to Rs 9,840.6 crore, compared to Rs 9,142.6 crore in the same quarter of FY25.

However, sustained liquidity inflows are helping to cushion the downside. This is evident in the current market environment, where a divergent trend is visible—while the benchmark index is under pressure, mainly due to weakness in heavyweight IT stock,"" Ajit Mishra, Senior Vice President at Religare Broking, said. ""At the same time, rate-sensitive sectors like auto, realty, and select banking, along with continued interest in defensives like FMCG and pharma, are not only limiting the losses but also offering ample long-side trading opportunities,"" he added. Most NSE sectoral indices slipped into the red on Friday. The Nifty Bank and Private Bank indices were among the worst performers, falling 0.91 percent and 1.33 percent, respectively. Consumer durables, energy, infra, FMCG, IT, and oil & gas sectors also slipped between 0.2 and 0.7 percent. The Nifty Auto index was marginally down 0.15 percent, while the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 shed 0.57 percent and 0.63 percent, respectively. On the positive side, the Nifty Realty index bucked the trend with a 0.45 percent gain. India VIX rose over 4 percent, indicating heightened market volatility. As for individual stocks, Wipro gained over 3 percent after the company reported a June quarter performance that was better than expected, driven by strong execution of large deals.

However, brokerages remain in a wait-and-watch mode as the management has guided for a stronger recovery in the second half of this fiscal year. So far in 2025, the stock of this IT services major has declined 13 percent, compared with a 5 percent gain in the benchmark Nifty 50 index. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog Motilal Oswal reiterated its ""sell"" rating on Wipro, with a target price of Rs 230 per share, citing a soft start to the year. The brokerage noted that while strong total contract value (TCV) from deals and early signs of stabilisation in Europe prompted a slight upward revision to FY26 and FY27 earnings estimates (by around 2 percent), there is limited room for margin expansion from current levels. They added that further improvement in execution and consistent conversion of deal wins to revenue will be key to turning constructive on the stock. Analysts at Choice Broking maintained their ""reduce"" rating with a target price of Rs 252. They pointed out that future performance depends heavily on execution and evolving macroeconomic conditions, as demand remains uncertain. According to analysts, Wipro expects Q2 revenue to grow between minus 1 percent and plus 1 percent sequentially in constant currency terms. The company expects a stronger start to the second half of FY26, supported by large recent deal wins and a healthy pipeline. Analysts believe that topline recovery will depend on favorable macro conditions and the positive impact of the Phoenix deal signed in Q4FY25, which could help rebound growth in Q3FY26 and position the company well for H2. Nuvama also maintained a ""hold"" rating with a target price of Rs 270, stating that strong deal wins should support growth in the coming quarters. The brokerage said it is awaiting clearer signs of macroeconomic improvement and consistent performance to turn more positive on the stock. It raised its FY26 and FY27 earnings estimates by 4.3 percent and 1.6 percent, respectively, on expectations of higher growth. Goldman Sachs kept its sell rating on Wipro but slightly raised its target price to Rs 254 from Rs 247 earlier. JPMorgan stayed neutral, maintaining its target price at Rs 260.

A rebound on Wall Street—driven by better-than-expected US retail sales data and a drop in weekly jobless claims—lifted the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to fresh record highs, setting a positive tone for Asian markets as well. Back home, the previous session ended on a sour note as late-day selling pressure, intensified by the weekly expiry, dragged the Nifty below the 25,200 mark and pulled the Sensex down by over 350 points. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) were net sellers to the tune of Rs 3,694 crore worth of shares in Indian equities, while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) net bought Rs 2,820 crore worth of shares. Here are the key levels to watch out for in today's session The psychological support of 25,000 remains intact, while the 25,350 mark continues to act as a formidable ceiling. Until the index breaks out from this congestion zone, significant directional moves are unlikely to unfold. From a technical standpoint, Nifty continues to trade below its 10-day and 20-day exponential moving averages, both of which are near the 25,250 mark. This highlights the persistent selling pressure near the upper boundary of the current range. ""Key support remains established at 56,600, while 57,350 persists as a strong resistance cap. Unless the index decisively moves beyond these levels, any meaningful trend development remains unlikely,"" Dhupesh Dhameja of SAMCO Securities said. ""The Relative Strength Index (RSI) continues to hover around the neutral 50 mark, reflecting a lack of conviction from both ends and reinforcing the ongoing consolidative structure. With earnings season set to kick off for major banking heavyweights, the index could likely find a fresh directional trigger in the coming sessions,"" he added. India VIX remained virtually unchanged, slipping marginally by 0.02 percent to settle at 11.24, staying well below the crucial 13 threshold. The prolonged low volatility environment indicates that while bears are active on rallies, there is no evident panic or fear-driven selling. This suggests the current phase is one of measured consolidation rather than capitulation. The Put-Call Ratio (PCR) has slipped from 0.80 to 0.69, signalling aggressive call writing and a declining bullish bias. The relatively low PCR reading reinforces the negative sentiment prevailing in the market.

ICICI Bank Q1 Preview: Modest growth likely as margins come under pressure,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/icici-bank-q1-preview-modest-growth-likely-as-margins-come-under-pressure-13291024.html,"ICICI Bank, India’s second-largest private lender, is expected to report modest growth in its net interest income (NII) and profit for the June quarter, as shrinking margins from lower repo rates might weigh on its performance, according to analysts. The lender is set to announce its Q1FY26 results on July 19, 2025. According to Moneycontrol's poll, ICICI Bank’s NII is likely to grow by about 8 percent year-on-year, reaching approximately Rs 21,091 crore in the first quarter of FY26, compared to Rs 19,552 crore in the same period last year. Similarly, its profit after tax (PAT) is projected to rise by a modest 9.5 percent to around Rs 12,112 crore, up from Rs 11,059 crore a year ago.  Estimates of analysts polled by Moneycontrol are shown to be in a narrow range, meaning any positive or negative surprises may elicit a sharp reaction in the stock price. Among the brokerages polled, Anand Rathi rolled out the most bullish projections while Equirus Research forecasted the slowest growth for ICICI Bank. What factors are driving the earnings? Margin compression: Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities expect ICICI Bank’s net interest margin (NIM) to decline by 31 basis points year-on-year, falling to 4 percent in Q1FY26 from 4.4 percent a year ago. This is largely because over half (53 percent) of the bank’s loans are linked to the repo rate, which has come down in recent months. Rising operating expenses: The bank’s operating expenses are expected to grow 8.4 percent year-on-year to Rs 11,419 crore in Q1FY26. Ashika Institutional Equity attributed this rise to continued investments in technology upgrades, digital channels, and process improvements, aimed at enhancing resilience and managing operational risks. Higher provisions: Provisions are expected to increase sequentially because the previous quarter included a one-time benefit from the sale of Rs 2,786 crore of non-performing assets (NPAs), of which Rs 314 crore was received in cash. However, Ashika analysts do not anticipate any major surprises in asset quality for the quarter. What should investors keep an eye on this quarter? Investors are likely to focus on the management’s commentary on net interest margin (NIM) guidance, trends in unsecured retail credit and overall retail loan demand as well as updates on asset quality metrics. During the April–June period, shares of ICICI Bank rose by 7 percent, outperforming the Nifty 50, which gained around 5 percent in the same time.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade V-Guard, Mahindra Holidays, Prestige Estates, Zydus Wellness, Welspun Corp, Blue Star and others on July 18?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-v-guard-mahindra-holidays-prestige-estates-zydus-wellness-welspun-corp-blue-star-and-others-on-july-18-13291887.html,"Equity benchmarks reversed most of the gains seen in the previous couple of sessions and closed 0.4 percent lower on July 17, but the market breadth was moderately weak. About 1,393 shares declined compared to 1,261 advancing shares on the NSE. The market needs a close above short-term moving averages for an upward journey; until then, consolidation may continue. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Jay Mehta, Technical Analyst at JM Financial Services V-Guard Industries | CMP: Rs 404.15  V-Guard has formed a bullish reversal inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on the daily chart, with a breakout on Thursday backed by rising volume and a golden crossover of the 50-day and 200-day EMAs. Momentum indicators like RSI and MACD are in bullish zones with positive crossovers, supporting the upward trend. The breakout candle has broken through a tight consolidation range since July 4, characterized by indecisive spinning top candles. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 430, Rs 450 Stop-Loss: Rs 380 Mahindra Holidays & Resorts India | CMP: Rs 363.7  Mahindra Holidays broke above a resistance trendline established since July 2024, accompanied by a gap-up opening suggestive of a breakaway gap, potentially initiating a bullish trend. The price now trades above key EMAs, which will serve as dynamic support. Thursday's elevated volume reflects strong buying interest, corroborated by bullish momentum indicators. A move above Rs 377 could accelerate the upward trajectory. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 390, Rs 400 Stop-Loss: Rs 341 Elgi Equipments | CMP: Rs 553.6  Elgi Equipments achieved a breakout from a tight consolidation range on July 9, which had been in place since June 2, 2025, and is currently retesting this zone. Thursday's price action found support at the confluence of the 200-day and 20-day EMAs. A breakout above the immediate resistance at Rs 568 could trigger an extension of a complex inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, targeting Rs 600, Rs 635, and Rs 655. Positive volume growth during the breakout, followed by reduced volume on the retest, alongside momentum indicators trading in bullish territory, supports the bullish outlook. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 600, Rs 635, Rs 655 Stop-Loss: Rs 512 Mandar Bhojane, Senior Equity Research Analyst at Choice Broking Prestige Estates Projects | CMP: Rs 1,783.2  Prestige Estates is currently showcasing a strong bullish setup, supported by a confluence of patterns across multiple timeframes. The stock is on the verge of a breakout from a Cup and Handle formation on the weekly chart, while it has already broken out of a falling trendline on the daily chart. This structure suggests strong accumulation and decreasing selling pressure, as the price consolidates just below the breakout zone. A decisive close above Rs 1,790, supported by higher volumes, would confirm the breakout and potentially trigger a sharp upmove. The stock is trading well above its 20, 50, 100, and 200-day EMAs, indicating strength across short-, medium-, and long-term trends. Momentum is also supportive — the RSI at 70 is trending upward, showing strong buying interest without overbought signals. Traders may consider a buy-on-dips strategy near Rs 1,720. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,000 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,680 Zydus Wellness | CMP: Rs 2,102.1  Zydus Wellness is consolidating near a key breakout zone, signaling underlying strength. On the daily chart, the stock is forming an Inverted Head and Shoulders pattern, a classic bullish reversal setup. Increasing volumes during the consolidation phase reflect growing investor interest and raise the probability of an upside breakout. A decisive close above Rs 2,125 would confirm the pattern breakout and could trigger strong bullish momentum. The RSI stands at 65.4 and is trending upward, indicating healthy momentum with more room to the upside. On the downside, immediate support lies at Rs 2,050, which can be considered a potential buy-on-dips zone for positional traders. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,360 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,975 Welspun Corp | CMP: Rs 931.9  Welspun Corp is on the verge of a breakout from a Flag and Pole pattern on the daily chart. This setup, combined with rising volumes, indicates renewed buying interest and suggests a potential trend shift in favour of the bulls. Technically, the RSI stands at 55.11 and is trending upward, also showing a bullish divergence, which reinforces the case for strengthening momentum. On the downside, Rs 905 acts as a strong support level and can be viewed as a key accumulation zone on dips. If the stock sustains above current levels with continued volume participation, it may move towards the short-term target of Rs 1,035. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,035 Stop-Loss: Rs 880 Om Mehra, Technical Research Analyst at Samco Securities Godrej Consumer Products | CMP: Rs 1,278.2  Godrej Consumer Products has resumed its upward momentum after a brief pause in the uptrend. The recent breakout above the Rs 1,245–1,255 zone has been accompanied by a noticeable rise in volume, confirming strength behind the move. The stock has witnessed a bullish crossover, with the 9-EMA now trading above both the 20-EMA and the 50-EMA, indicating strong alignment across short- to medium-term averages. The stock continues to hold above the 50-day simple moving average, currently placed at Rs 1,240, which now serves as immediate support. The RSI stands at 63 and remains in the bullish zone, while the MACD continues to show a positive crossover with widening histogram bars, highlighting the ongoing momentum. The stock is currently forming a Cup with Handle pattern (bullish), and the price is holding firmly near the breakout zone. Improving volume participation validates the recent breakout and supports the bullish continuation. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,360 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,230 Blue Star | CMP: Rs 1,882.6  Blue Star has registered a decisive breakout from a classic Cup formation on the daily chart. The breakout above the neckline resistance at Rs 1,850 has occurred with a steady rise in volume, confirming participation and validating the pattern’s completion. The stock is now holding above the 9, 20, and 50-day moving averages. Importantly, the close is just below the 200-SMA, and a follow-through above Rs 1,890 would further strengthen the trend confirmation. The overall structure displays clean higher lows on the right side of the cup, with rising volume supporting the upward drift. The recent consolidation just below the neckline acted as the handle portion, which resolved positively. The RSI stands elevated at 70, staying in the bullish zone without divergence. The MACD remains positively aligned above the signal line, indicating continued strength. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,970 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,835 Gujarat State Petronet | CMP: Rs 335.8  Gujarat State Petronet (GSPL) has broken out of a short-term contracting triangle on the daily chart. The pattern exhibits a series of higher highs and higher lows, and the breakout candle has closed firmly above the previous resistance, indicating an ongoing bullish trend. The stock has managed to close above the 20-EMA and the 50-day simple moving averages. This move, following a narrow-range consolidation, suggests an improving short-term setup. However, the immediate zone of interest now lies around Rs 338–340, which may act as a minor hurdle. The RSI has risen to 57 and is gradually trending higher, while the stochastic oscillator has crossed above 70, supported by a clean signal-line crossover. Both indicators are pointing to improving momentum. Volume has held steady in recent sessions.

"SEBI member hints at increase in tenure of F&O contracts, raises concerns over huge volume in short-term contracts",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sebi-member-hints-at-increase-in-tenure-of-f-o-contracts-raises-concerns-with-huge-volume-in-short-term-contracts-13289373.html,"SEBI whole-time member Ananth Narayan on July 17 expressed concerns over huge volume in short-term F&O contracts and also said that the regulator would look improve the quality of the F&O market ""by extending the tenure and maturity of the products and solutions on offer"". ""As many experts have pointed out, our Indian derivative market ecosystem is quite unique, in that on expiry days, comparable turnover in index options are often 350 times or more the turnover in the underlying cash market –an imbalance that is obviously unhealthy, with several potential adverse consequences,"" said Narayan at 11th Capital Markets Conclave of CII in Kolkata. ""Research has suggested that expiry day option trading increases market volatility and could lead to noise trading that may potentially undermine confidence in price formation. Unlike longer term derivatives, short-term derivative products such as expiry day trading in index options may detract from capital formation,"" added Narayan. Narayan said the market regulator must look to deepen cash equities markets. ""We must look for further ways to further deepen our cash equities markets, even as we look to improve the quality of our derivatives market by extending the tenure and maturity of the products and solutions on offer,"" said Narayan. SEBI’s own updated research shows that 91% of individual traders incurred net losses trading in F&O in FY25, with their aggregate losses crossing Rs 1 lakh crore. ""This is a large sum of money that could have otherwise gone towards responsible investing and capital formation,"" said Narayan. Clearly indicating that the regulator is uncomfortable with the volume of weekly F&O contracts, he said that SEBI is aware of the potential concerns of exchanges, brokers, and other intermediaries, as their revenues depend heavily on the volumes of these weekly contracts. However, he also emphasized the need to reconsider whether such a trend is sustainable. He highlighted the steps SEBI has taken in the past to curb the volume of weekly contracts. October 1 last year, SEBI issued a circular and tightened the rules—such as limiting weekly expiries to only one benchmark index, increasing lot sizes, mandating upfront collection of premiums, removing margin benefits on expiry day, introducing intraday monitoring of position limits, and increasing margins near contract expiry. In May 2025, SEBI announced another set of measures to address the issue of rising equity derivatives volumes. These include tracking future-equivalent open interest, linking the market-wide position limit (MWPL) to cash volumes, allowing position creation for single stocks during the ban period if it reduces risk, intraday monitoring of market-wide position utilization, fixing position limits for index futures and options, and establishing new criteria for derivatives on benchmark indices. Ananth Narayan also called for deepening the cash market. He said, “We must look for further ways to deepen our cash equities markets, even as we strive to improve the quality of our derivatives market by extending the tenure and maturity of the products and solutions on offer.” Narayan concluded by stating that all stakeholders need to engage in constructive dialogue on the issue."
"The ""technical"" one-time hit behind Axis Bank's Q1 miss - management explains",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/the-technical-one-time-hit-behind-axis-bank-s-q1-miss-management-explains-13291646.html,"Axis Bank’s June quarter earnings were impacted by a one-time technical adjustment, which resulted in higher slippages and weighed on profitability. To explain this impact, the bank’s CFO Puneet Sharma used a simple example in its post-results conference call: Imagine a customer, let’s call them X — who has a personal loan of Rs 100 and is already 5 days overdue. The bank’s collections team assesses that X may not be able to fully repay and offers a one-time settlement (OTS): the loan will be repaid in three installments of Rs 30 each, with a 90-day moratorium before payments begin. During the moratorium, the days-past-due (DPD) counter continues to move because no payment has been made yet. On the 95th day, after the moratorium ends, X pays Rs 30, clearing all past overdue amounts and resetting the DPD to zero. ALSO READ: Axis Bank Q1 earnings hurt by higher slippages from one-time technical adjustments Earlier, the bank would have upgraded the account’s status to “good” as soon as the DPD returned to zero, even though the customer still owed Rs 70. But now, under stricter technical parameters, the bank does not immediately upgrade such accounts. Instead, it waits until all settlement terms are fully honored and other qualitative checks are satisfied. This shift — from relying purely on DPD to applying stricter, qualitative criteria — meant more accounts stayed classified as bad loans, resulting in higher reported slippages for the quarter. Specifically, the technical impact pushed Q1 slippages to Rs 8,200 crore, of which about Rs 2,709 crore was attributable to these new parameters. Without the technical adjustment, slippages would have been Rs 5,491 crore. The technical impact also weighed on profitability metrics: it reduced Q1 profit after tax by Rs 614 crore, lowered return on assets by 15 basis points, and pulled down return on equity by 140 basis points, the bank said. By tightening its rules, Axis Bank said that they opted for a more cautious approach to classifying loans, prioritising repayment quality over just the overdue count resetting to zero. Having said that, Sharma noted that this is one example. ""The criteria changes across multiple examples. We would not like to discuss all of them on the call,"" he added.

‘Inverted C’ margin path: Axis Bank outlines how NIMs will move this cycle,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/inverted-c-margin-path-axis-bank-outlines-how-nims-will-move-this-cycle-13291534.html,"Axis Bank’s bottom line in the June quarter was impacted by one-time technical adjustments, which led to higher slippages and a temporary deterioration in asset quality. The bank also saw its net interest margin (NIM) contract by 25 basis points year-on-year to 3.8 percent. Looking ahead, the management expressed confidence that margins will remain around the current level of 3.8 percent through the rate cycle — the cycle that began with the last repo rate cut. “Our stated position is that we are confident we can deliver a 3.8 percent margin on a through-cycle basis,” the management said during the post-results conference call. ALSO READ: Axis Bank Q1 earnings hurt by higher slippages from one-time technical adjustments “We believe margins will return to the levels we have indicated over time. Think of the margin trajectory as an inverted C — margins dip initially when rate cuts are announced and then climb back up towards the end of the cycle,” the bank explained. On how the next quarter might play out, Amitabh Chaudhry, CEO of Axis Bank, added that the full impact of the most recent rate cuts has not yet been fully reflected in earnings. “In the current quarter, we have fully absorbed — on a full book and full quarter basis — the first 25 basis points rate cut. The next 75 basis points rate cut has only partially flowed through so far,” Chaudhry said. “In the coming quarter, the full effect of that 75 basis points cut will be visible. However, it will also be partly offset by savings from lower deposit and borrowing costs. Since over 70 percent of our loan book is floating, the direction of margins is quite clear,” he explained.

Axis Bank Q1 earnings hurt by higher slippages from one-time technical adjustments,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/axis-bank-q1-earnings-hurt-by-higher-slippages-from-one-time-technical-adjustments-13291439.html,"Axis Bank reported a 4 percent year-on-year drop in net profit, which stood at Rs 6,034 crore for the June quarter (Q1FY26). The decline was due to a one-time “technical impact”, which affected how the bank recognised slippages and upgrades. The bank explained that it applied new technical parameters for recognising certain accounts as slippages or upgrades, which led to higher reported slippages for the quarter. “This technical impact is largely limited to cash credit and overdraft accounts, and to accounts that have been given one-time settlements,” said Puneet Sharma, Chief Financial Officer at Axis Bank during the post-results conference call. “Because of this, the reported numbers for gross slippages, net slippages, credit costs, NPA ratios, ROA, and ROE are not directly comparable with the figures from previous quarters or the same period last year,” he clarified. ALSO READ: Axis Bank Q1 results: Net profit declines 4% to Rs 5,806 crore, NII marginally up The bank pointed out that without this one-time adjustment, the net profit would have been stronger. The technical impact reduced profit after tax (PAT) by Rs 614 crore, brought down return on assets (ROA) by 15 basis points, and return on equity (ROE) by 1.4 percent. Providing more details, Sharma noted that reported gross slippages for the quarter were Rs 8,200 crore, of which about Rs 2,709 crore was due to the technical impact. This technical impact accounted for 1.03 percent of gross slippages in value terms. If we exclude the technical impact, gross slippages rose by 13 basis points year-on-year and by 20 basis points compared to the previous quarter. Breaking it down further, the technical impact on gross slippages was Rs 2,165 crore from the retail segment, Rs 234 crore from the wholesale segment, and Rs 310 crore from the commercial banking group (CBG). Similarly, on the net slippages side, Rs 1,861 crore was due to the technical impact, making up 0.71 percent of net slippages for the quarter in value terms. After adjusting for the technical impact, the net slippage was Rs 4,192 crore. The reported net slippage ratio, annualised for Q1FY26, was 2.33 percent, but when adjusted for the technical impact, it was 1.62 percent.

During the March quarter, 360 ONE WAM and leading global wealth manager UBS AG entered into an exclusive strategic collaboration where clients from both institutions got access to wealth management solutions. Both entities are also exploring opportunities for deep co-operation in asset management and capital markets too. Earlier this year, 360 ONE WAM had acquired Batlivala & Karani Securities in order to grow presence across broking, capital markets, merchant banking, and corporate treasury, along with wealth and alternate asset management. India is one of the fastest-growing wealth markets with 2.83 lakh HNIs with over $5 million in assets, a report by Kotak Private said in 2023, which is expected to rise by 52 percent to 4.30 lakh individuals by 2028."
"HDFC Bank Q1 Preview: NII to grow in single-digit amid slower loan growth, margins may compress",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/hdfc-bank-q1-preview-nii-to-grow-in-single-digits-amid-slower-loan-growth-margins-may-compress-13290731.html,"India's largest private lender HDFC Bank is likely to see single-digit net interest income (NII) and profit growth amid soft loan growth, while margins are expected to remain under pressure due to faster repricing of loans on account of interest rate cuts, said analysts. The bank will report Q1 results on July 19, 2025. According to Moneycontrol's poll, HDFC Bank’s net interest income is likely to rise 7 percent year-on-year, reaching about Rs 31,885 crore in Q1FY26, compared to Rs 29,837 crore in the same period last year. The bank’s profit after tax (PAT) is also projected to grow modestly by 7.4 percent, to approximately Rs 17,385 crore, up from Rs 16,174 crore a year ago.  Estimates of analysts polled by Moneycontrol are shown to be in a narrow range, meaning any positive or negative surprises may elicit a sharp reaction in the stock price. Among the brokerages polled, Kotak Institutional Equities rolled out the most bullish projections while Equirus Research forecasted the slowest growth for HDFC Bank. What factors are driving the earnings? Fast deposit growth, but slower credit offtake: HDFC Bank reported that its average gross advances stood at about Rs 26 lakh crore as of June 30, 2025, showing a growth of roughly 6.7 percent over Rs 24 lakh crore in the year-ago period. Meanwhile, deposits rose more sharply, climbing 16.2 percent to Rs 27.6 lakh crore from Rs 24 lakh crore as of June 30, 2024. Margin compression: Analysts at Kotak believe that the bank’s net interest margin (NIM) is likely to drop by 31 basis points year-on-year, settling at 3.4 percent in Q1FY26 compared to 3.5 percent a year earlier. This is due to quicker loan repricing during the quarter. Higher provisions: Provisions are expected to be higher sequentially, as the bank plans to use the gains from the sale of shares in HDB Financial Services to increase floating provisions. Systematix Institutional Equities noted that HDFC Bank will book a one-time gain of Rs 9,373 crore from HDB’s IPO and may allocate around Rs 6,000 crore for additional prudential provisions. What should investors keep an eye on this quarter? Investors are likely to focus on deposit growth, loan growth, and margin trends to assess the bank’s outlook. During the April-June period, shares of HDFC Bank gained 9 percent, outperforming the benchmark Nifty 50 index, which rose 5 percent during the same time.

Outlook for July 18 Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities: Today, the benchmark indices witnessed profit booking at higher levels. The Nifty ends 101 points lower, while the Sensex was down by 375 points. Among sectors, the Reality index was the top gainer, rallied 1.23 percent, whereas the IT index lost the most, shed 1.50 percent. Technically, after a muted open, the market has been consistently facing selling pressure at higher levels. The Nifty/Sensex has formed a bearish candle on daily charts and a lower top formation on intraday charts, which is largely negative. We are of the view that, as long as the market is trading below 25,200/82,500, the weak sentiment is likely to continue. On the downside, the 50-day SMA (Simple Moving Average) at 25,000/82,000 would be the immediate support level. Below 25,000/82,000, the chances of hitting 24,900-24,850/81,600-81,500 would increase. On the upside, a break above 25,200/82,500 could lead the market to retest the levels of 25,280/82,800. A successful breakout above 25,280/82,800 could push the market up to 25,350-25,425/83,000-83,300. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities Nifty remained mostly under selling pressure throughout the day as the index failed to move beyond the crucial resistance level of 25,260, leading to long unwinding. On the hourly chart, a consolidation breakout is visible, indicating weakening bullish momentum. The current sentiment appears bearish and may drag Nifty towards the 24,920–24,900 zone in the short term. On the higher side, 25,260 is likely to remain a strong resistance.

"Jewellery shares extend gains for a fifth session on value buying: Up to 5% surge in Senco, Titan, Kalyan",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/jewellery-shares-extend-gains-for-a-fifth-session-on-value-buying-up-to-5-surge-in-senco-titan-kalyan-13289244.html,"Shares of jewellery companies extended gains on July 17, supported by value buying and firm gold prices even as the broader market stayed subdued, with Senco Gold, Titan, Kalyan Jewellers and Goldiam International among key gainers higher by up to 6 percent in trade. Analysts said the ongoing rally in jewellery counters was driven by a combination of healthy business updates, optimism around demand during the upcoming wedding and festive season, and steady expansion plans by key players. Senco Gold shares rose 4.76 percent to an intraday high of Rs 372 apiece on the NSE. The stock has gained nearly 10 percent over the past five sessions. Kalyan Jewellers jumped 3.27 percent to Rs 609.50, while Titan Company advanced 1 percent to touch a high of Rs 3,448. Shares of Goldiam International climbed over 6 percent to Rs 363.5. International gold prices too have provided support, with the yellow metal higher by around 26 percent in the first half of 2025, supported by a weaker US dollar, rangebound interest rates and persistent geopolitical uncertainty. According to a recent World Gold Council (WGC) report, gold is expected to stay rangebound in the second half of 2025, with a possible upside of up to 5 percent from current levels. The report also pointed to global GDP remaining below trend and inflation staying above 5 percent, partly due to rising tariffs. A potential rate cut by the US Federal Reserve and continued uncertainty could further sustain demand for gold, the report said.

Hold Larsen and Toubro Technology Services; target of Rs 4250: Prabhudas Lilladher,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/hold-larsen-and-toubro-technology-services-target-of-rs-4250-prabhudas-lilladher-13288897.html,"Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Larsen and Toubro Technology Services The revenue growth (-4.2% QoQ CC) was below our estimates (-2.5% QoQ CC), attributed to the SWC seasonality, however ex-India USD revenue grew by 1.5% QoQ. The mobility business (ex-Auto) has stabilized and picked up pace in the off-highway and trucks segments, while Automotive sees incremental pauses and deferrals on executions. The weakness in the Automotive is fairly balanced against the momentum within Sustainability, validated through securing $50m deal within the space. The deal ramp up would support the growth in H2, and even beyond the sizable win ($200m+ LD TCV) the deal pipeline seems to be robust. Given the revenue miss in Q1, the ask-rare translates to ~2.8% CQGR for the rest of the year to achieve low double-digit CC growth. We believe the large deal ramp up and positive SWC seasonality would support growth in H2 to achieve directional milestone. Margins were largely stable despite the notable revenue decline, partly aided by low-margin SWC seasonality and continued momentum in high-margin Sustainability business. We are adjusting our revenue growth against Q1 miss, while keeping our margin estimates largely unchanged. We are building in 9.8%/9.2% CC revenue growth, while keeping EBIT margins unchanged at 13.9%/14.7% for FY26E/FY27E. Outlook We are assigning 29x PE to FY27E EPS, translating a TP of 4,250.

Revenue grew 1.0% QoQ to USD1.56bn (down 1.4% CC), marginally missing estimates. With EBITM expanding by 60bps QoQ to 11.1%, TechM logged the 7th quarter of margin expansion, on disciplined execution and benefits accruing from Project Fortius, albeit a tad lower than estimated. Deal intake stayed strong for a 3rd straight quarter, with TCV of USD809mn driving 44% growth in deal intake on TTM basis. Revenue conversion was hit by a challenging macro environment, right-sizing field service business, reduced spending in Auto, and certain client run-offs leading to a slower start in FY26. However, the mgmt expects growth to improve Q2 onward, and certainly from H2, backed by deal wins and pipeline. The mgmt reiterated its 15% EBITM target for FY27, albeit suggesting risk from the prolonged period of an uncertain and tough macro environment. Outlook We cut FY26E-28E EPS by 2.4%-0.1%, factoring in the Q1 performance. Given the rich valuations, we retain REDUCE on TechM with TP of Rs 1,600 at 20x Jun-27E EPS.

Mixed cues from Asian markets and lingering worries over weak Q1 earnings and tariff uncertainties kept sentiment under pressure. At about 9:40 am, the Sensex was down 69.33 points or 0.08 percent at 82,565.15, and the Nifty was down 22.70 points or 0.09 percent at 25,189.35. About 1841 shares advanced, 1053 shares declined, and 175 shares remained unchanged. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Investors are treading a fine line between optimism and caution during the current relief rally, as they closely watch Q1FY26 corporate earnings. With valuations running high, an upgrade in earnings is crucial to justify the premium. Meanwhile, global sentiment remains uncertain, weighed down by ongoing tariff concerns, Vinod Nair of Geojit Investments Limited said. However, India’s macroeconomic outlook remains robust, underpinned by a steady decline in inflation, easing interest rates, a favourable monsoon, and cooling oil prices. The market has drawn support from eight consecutive months of falling inflation, boosting investor confidence. At market open on Thursday, July 17, sectoral indices were trading mixed, reflecting a cautious start to the session. The Nifty Pharma index led the gains, rising 0.71 percent, followed by Nifty Realty and Nifty Metal, which were up 0.66 percent and 0.30 percent, respectively. Consumer durables, FMCG, energy, and auto indices also saw mild gains. On the flip side, selling pressure was visible in banking and IT stocks, with Nifty PSU Bank falling 0.44 percent and Nifty IT down 0.23 percent.

Emcure Pharmaceuticals rose 2 percent after it signed a deal with Sanofi India to distribute and promote Sanofi’s oral anti-diabetic drugs, including Amaryl and Cetapin, across India. The collaboration aims to expand access to trusted diabetes therapies through Emcure’s strong national network. As for key levels, Nifty is exhibiting early signs of a potential pullback, with persistent buying interest emerging at lower levels, signalling a tug-of-war between bulls and bears. The index has consistently closed above its previous day’s low, indicating a gradual build-up of momentum and the formation of a strong base near the psychologically significant 25,000 level, which also aligns with the 50% Fibonacci retracement, acting as a crucial support. However, the index continues to oscillate below its immediate hurdle at 25,350. Until a breakout occurs, upward moves may remain capped. Hindalco, Sun Pharma, Apollo Hospitals, Adani Enterprises, and Tata Motors were the top gainers on the Nifty. Laggards on the index included Tech Mahindra, ICICI Bank, HDFC Life Insurance, SBI Life Insurance, and Eternal.

"Brokerages mixed on Tech Mahindra following Q1 show, shares fall; should you buy, sell, or hold shares?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/brokerages-mixed-on-tech-mahindra-following-q1-show-should-you-buy-sell-or-hold-shares-13288046.html,"Information and technology player Tech Mahindra Ltd (TechM) shares fell on Thursday, July 17, after the Mahindra Group company posted its earnings show for the three months ended June 30, 2025. Brokerages remained mixed on their outlook for the firm following strong deal wins during the quarter, while the revenue came in under estimates. Tech Mahindra delivered a strong performance in Q1 FY26, with net profit rising 34 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,141 crore, up from Rs 852 crore a year earlier. The jump in profit came as revenue increased and overall expenses stayed flat. Consolidated revenue grew 3 percent year-on-year to Rs 13,351 crore, while total expenditure edged down slightly to Rs 11,952 crore, aiding margin improvement. However, revenue from the Americas, which contributes nearly half of the company’s total revenue, declined 5.9 percent year-on-year. Net new deal bookings rose to $809 million, up from $798 million in the previous quarter and $534 million in the same period last year. At 9.40 a.m., shares were quoting Rs 1,589.7, down 1.3 percent on the NSE. Should you buy, sell, or hold shares of Tech Mahindra? International brokerage CLSA has an 'outperform' rating with a Rs 2,020 target. The company reported an in-line EBIT, with strong order wins and better margins offsetting slower revenue. CLSA expects growth to pick up from the next quarter, with FY26 revenue likely to surpass FY25. TechM's Q1FY26 is in line with the FY27 strategy, and the management expects above-average growth in FY27, though delays in margin expansion remain a key risk, said HSBC. The brokerage maintained a 'buy' call with a Rs 1,900 target. While the earnings show for the quarter were mixed, the deal wins and pipeline are strong, Nomura noted, expecting better revenue growth in FY26. Nomura has a 'buy' rating on TechM's shares and a Rs 1,810 target price. Jefferies retained an 'underperform' call with a Rs 1,400 target, while Morgan Stanley has an 'underweight' rating with a Rs 1,555 target. The brokerages noted that Q1 revenue missed but profits beat due to higher other income. Order wins were strong, but rich valuations and margin expansion challenges keep its cautious view. The positives for Tech Manhindra are as robust deal wins, stable top clients, and gradual margin improvement. However, concerns remain over weak deal conversion, a challenging manufacturing outlook, and macro headwinds that may impact the balance between growth and margins.

Market mood got a slight lift after Donald Trump ruled out firing US Fed Chair Jerome Powell and hinted at a potential trade deal with India. However, persistent concerns over Q1 earnings and tariff-related uncertainties continue to weigh on investor sentiment. Around 7:40 am, GIFT Nifty was up 0.2 percent at 25,280.

Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates On July 16, Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) were net sellers to the tune of Rs 1858 crore worth of shares in Indian equities, while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) net bought Rs 1224 crore worth of shares, according to provisional NSE data. Here are the important levels to watch out for in today's session Nifty index is exhibiting early signs of a potential pullback, with persistent buying interest emerging at lower levels, signalling a tug-of-war between bulls and bears. The index has consistently closed above its previous day’s low, indicating a gradual build-up of momentum and the formation of a strong base near the psychologically significant 25,000 level, which also aligns with the 50% Fibonacci retracement, acting as a crucial support. However, the index continues to oscillate below its immediate hurdle at 25,350. Until a breakout occurs, upward moves may remain capped. ""Nifty Bank index is hinting at a resurgence in bullish sentiment, supported by consistent buying activity from lower levels, with dips being actively absorbed, highlighting underlying strength,"" Dhupesh Dhameja of SAMCO Securities said. ""Encouragingly, the index continues to sustain above its 10-day and 20-day EMAs, both of which are upward sloping, providing cushion at lower zones and reinforcing the bullish undertone. The 57,350–57,400 range has now become a key resistance pocket or supply zone. A clean breakout above 57,350 is essential to signal trend continuation on the upside,"" he added. India VIX declined further by 2.1 percent to settle at 11.24, continuing to hover well below the critical 15-mark. This prolonged low-volatility phase signals that while sellers remain active at higher levels, there is no sense of panic in the market. The muted VIX suggests a controlled consolidation rather than a fear-driven selloff, highlighting a lack of directional conviction. The Put-Call Ratio (PCR) has improved slightly to 0.80 from 0.75, reflecting an uptick in put writing. However, the relatively low PCR still underline a bearish undertone in the market.
