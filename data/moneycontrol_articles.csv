"Vedanta shares fall 3% as analysts flag Rs 17,000-cr Jaiprakash Associates offer as 'negative'",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/vedanta-shares-fall-3-as-analysts-flag-rs-17-000-cr-jaiprakash-associates-offer-as-negative-13528275.html,"The shares of Vedanta dropped nearly 3 percent on September 8 after the company reportedly outbid the Adani Group with a Rs 17,000-crore offer for the assets of the bankrupt Jaiprakash Associates, which currently faces claims worth Rs 59,000 crore from various creditors. Vedanta's bid is higher than that of the Adani Group in the open challenge round, CNBC-TV18 reported citing people familiar with the matter. Other suitors in the fray include Dalmia Bharat Group, Jindal Power, and PNC Infratech, who have yet not submitted any bids in the final round, the report added. Moneycontrol couldn't independently verify the report. Nuvama said that it is a negative development for the minority shareholders of Vedanta, and the brokerage firm remains unconvinced by the group's rationale to acquire the assets, according to the brokerage note cited by CNBC-TV18. Vedanta is getting involved in an unrelated business when the group's priority should be deleveraging, Nuvama further stated, while adding that funding the Rs 17,000 crore itself would be difficult. “Culmination of the transaction is likely to restrict any re-rating for the stock,"" the Nuvama note cited by the business news channel said. Nuvama held its ‘Buy’ rating on the stock. ICICI Securities also noted that the development was unexpected as Jaiprakash Associates’ business portfolio does not align well with Vedanta's operations, according to the brokerage note cited by Business Standard. It added that most of JP’s businesses have been making losses for years, with some being entangled in legal disputes. This makes the outlook uncertain, it further said. Jaiprakash Power shares meanwhile jumped 5 percent to hit the upper circuit at Rs 20.02 apiece. The stock has so far gained nearly 8 percent in the past five days, and around 42 percent in the past six months. The stock currently has a P/E ratio of 17.59. Real estate and infrastructure firm Jaiprakash Associates (JAL) was admitted to Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) in 2024, after defaulting on payment of loans worth over Rs 57,000 crore. Billionaire Gautam Adani-led Adani Group, Anil Agarwal's Vedanta, Dalmia Bharat and several others had submitted their resolution plans to acquire JAL through the insolvency process. Jaypee Group's real estate holdings include high-profile projects such as the 452-acre Jaypee Greens township in Greater Noida, featuring luxury villas, apartments, and a golf course. Other assets include Jaypee Greens Wish Town Noida, a sprawling 1,063-acre township, and the Jaypee Greens Sports City, which boasts a motor racing track along the Yamuna Expressway. The resolution process for Jaypee Group involves a committee of creditors, including major financial institutions such as the State Bank of India (SBI), ICICI Bank and Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC). JAL owns 24 percent stake in Jaiprakash Power Ventures.

"Tata Motors, M&M, other auto stocks rise up to 6% amid price cuts by some automakers, BofA upgrades",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/tata-motors-m-m-other-auto-stocks-rise-up-to-4-amid-price-cuts-by-some-automakers-bofa-upgrades-13527969.html,"Auto stocks surged on September 8 after some automakers announced strong price cuts after the GST Council decided to reduced taxes on several vehicles. The sharp rise in the share prices pushed the Nifty Auto index up around 2.5 percent in morning trade. The auto index rose to 26,977, emerging as the top sectoral gainer on the stock market today. Bharat Forge and Ashok Leyland shares lead the gains, rising around 6 percent and over 4 percent respectively. Bank of America (BofA) has increased the target prices of several auto stocks, anticipating sharp upside potential after the latest GST cuts. Tata Motors shares jumped nearly 3 percent to trade at Rs 712 apiece. The company on September 5 said that it will pass on the full benefits of the recent GST rate reduction to customers across its cars and SUVs, with price cuts of up to Rs 1.55 lakh effective September 22. Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) shares jumped more than 3 percent to trade at Rs 3,672 apiece. The company also had announced that it will fully pass on the GST 2.0 benefits to customers across its ICE SUV portfolio with immediate effect. As a reduction in GST, M&M's popular models like the Thar, Scorpio, Bolero, XUV700, and Scorpio-N will now be available with substantial savings ranging from Rs 1.01 lakh to Rs 1.56 lakh, depending on the model and variant. BofA increased its target price for M&M to Rs 4,000 per share, from Rs 3,750 per share, while keeping its 'Buy' rating on the stock, according to the brokerage note cited by NDTV Profit. The latest target price implies an upside potential of more than 12 percent over the stock's previous closing price of Rs 3,561.30 per share. Samvardhana Motherson shares gained nearly 4 percent, while Bajaj Auto, Hero Moto Corp and TVS Motors shares were up around 3 percent. For the two-wheeler makers too, BofA has increased the target prices, while remaining 'Neutral'. For Bajaj Auto, the international brokerage increased the target price to Rs 9,600 apiece, while for TVS Motors, it increased the target price to Rs 3,725 apiece, according to the brokerage note cited by NDTV Profit. Hero MotoCorp's price target was increased to Rs 5,650 apiece. Maruti Suzuki shares gained nearly 1.6 percent. While the company has not announced price cuts yet, its Chairman RC Bhargava in an interview with Financial Express hinted at strong reduction in car prices. He told the publication that the price of Alto could drop by Rs 45,000, while the WagonR may see price cuts between Rs 60,000 and Rs 70,000. BofA has increased the target price for the stock to Rs 17,000 per share, from Rs 14,000 per share, and has maintained its 'Buy' rating on the stock, according to the brokerage note cited by NDTV Profit. ICICI Securities has a 'Buy' call on Maruti Suzuki, and increased its target price to Rs 17,000 per share. This implies an upside potential of more than 14 percent from the stock's previous closing price of Rs 14,895 per share. ""The recent reduction in GST rates from 28% to 18% across most segments in the auto sector may inject fresh demand momentum. This is in addition to the recent rationalisation of personal income tax slabs, interest rate cuts and the upcoming Pay Commission revisions. These factors are expected to increase affordability and stimulate demand, addressing the industry's challenges of muted sales, especially in the entry level segment,"" the domestic brokerage said. Eicher Motors shares meanwhile were trading more than 2 percent higher. BofA has increased its target price for the stock to Rs 7,500 apiece, implying an upside potential of nearly 14 percent from the stock's previous closing price. Hyundai Motor India, which is not a part of the Nifty Auto index, rose nearly 2 percent. Bosch and Balkrishna Industries shares were up more than 1 percent each.

Here is how financial markets across the globe fared overnight: GIFT Nifty (Up) The GIFT Nifty is trading higher at around 24,913.50, indicating a positive start for the day. Asian Equities (Gain) Asian markets traded mostly higher Monday as investors assessed Japan Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba’s resignation announcement over the weekend, and eyed key economic data in the region.  US Equities (Down) US stocks ended slightly lower on Friday as investors weighed economic worries against optimism over interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve after data showed U.S. job growth weakened sharply in August.

However, on year-to-date basis, except Indonesian Rupiah, all other currencies gained between 2.7.5 percent.

Gold (Flat) Gold traded near Friday’s record high, bolstered by an unexpectedly weak US employment report that saw wagers increase on the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates.

SEBI to consider proposals to boost ease of doing business on September 12,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sebi-to-consider-proposals-to-boost-ease-of-doing-business-on-september-12-13527052.html,"Market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) may clear major proposals related to ease of doing business in its board meeting scheduled on September 12. According to sources, the key proposals may include easing stake dilution for mega initial public offerings (IPOs), expanding rating agency activities, revamping RTA and broker rules, granting equity status to REITs, InvITs, introducing accredited investor AIF schemes and strengthening exchange governance as well as easing norms for investment advisors and research analysts. The details of the proposals are here: Less stake dilution in mega IPOs The regulator's board may clear proposal of easing stake dilution norms for very large companies by allowing smaller initial offerings and longer timelines to meet minimum public shareholding (MPS) rules.  Sources said, the move aims to reduce immediate pressure on issuers while ensuring gradual compliance. For IPOs with post-issue market cap of Rs 50,000–1,00,000 crore, the minimum issue will be Rs 1,000 crore plus 8 percent, with 25 percent MPS in 5 years instead of 3. For companies worth Rs 100,000–Rs 500,000 crore, the requirement will be Rs 6,250 crore plus 2.75 percent, with MPS deadlines extended up to 10 years depending on shareholding levels. Above Rs 500,000 crore, dilution will be Rs 15,000 crore plus 1 percent, subject to at least 2.5 percent. Insurance, pension funds Quota in IPOs, more anchor allocation The board may also clear the proposal of changes in the anchor investor allocation rules in IPOs to encourage participation from large investors and make the process easier. Sources said, the number of anchor allottees for IPOs sized Rs 250–500 crore is proposed to rise from 25 to 30. Insurance companies and pension funds may be included alongside mutual funds in reserved anchor allocations, increasing the reserved portion from 33 percent to 40 percent. Mutual funds would retain 33 percent, with the remaining 7 percent for insurance and pension funds. Unsubscribed portions could revert to mutual funds, diversifying the investor base. Materiality threshold for Related Party Transactions Sources said, regulator’s board may also discuss and approve a threshold-based framework to determine the materiality of related party transactions (RPTs). Linking the compliance burden with the turnover scale of listed entities. A new framework for related party transactions (RPTs) is expected to ease compliance while protecting minority shareholders. Proposal is linking RPT materiality thresholds to company turnover. Companies with turnover up to Rs 20,000 crore would treat transactions exceeding 10 percent of turnover as material. For turnover between Rs 20,001–40,000 crore, thresholds would be Rs 2,000 crore plus 5 percent of incremental turnover. For turnover above Rs 40,000 crore, the limit would be Rs 3,000 crore plus 2.5 percent of incremental turnover, capped at Rs 5,000 crore. Currently, LODR norms require shareholder approval for RPTs exceeding Rs 1,000 crore or 10 percent of turnover. Expanding scope of work for Credit Rating Agencies Board may clear path for CRAs to rate financial instruments overseen by other financial sector regulators like RBI, IRDAI, PFRDA, IFSCA, MCA and IBBI, provided they comply with the respective regulator’s framework on eligibility, risk management, grievance redressal, and enforcement. Sources said, this is part of easing business restrictions on regulated entitites. To ensure segregation, such non-Sebi activities must be conducted through ring-fenced Separate Business Units (SBUs), with distinct staff, records, and grievance mechanisms. Marketing material and rating reports for such services must carry disclaimers. Equity classification for REITs and InvITs Sebi board may discuss the issue of granting equity classification to REITs and InvITs, which are currently treated as hybrid instruments blending debt and equity features. This will allow mutual funds to include these instruments in equity schemes, increasing retail investor access and boosting participation. Listed on stock exchanges, REITs and InvITs provide a combination of steady income and potential capital appreciation. Review of Stock Broker Regulations Sources said, the Sebi board may also clear the revamped stock broker regulations, to align with evolving market practices. The changes focus on stronger governance, client protection, and compliance. Key provisions include mandatory Sebi approval for any change in control, prompt disclosure of material changes, and updated definitions for algorithmic trading, proprietary trading, and clearing members, while deleting outdated terms like “small investor.” Criteria for Qualified Stock Brokers (QSBs) will rely on measurable metrics with stricter governance standards. The proposal also allows brokers access to Sebi-approved activities, alongside stronger client safeguards and bans on unauthorized schemes. Review of Registrar and Share Transfer Agent Regulation According to sources, regulators board may approve activity-based regulations for Registrar and Transfer Agents (RTAs) to clearly separate their services for listed and unlisted companies. Sebi had noted that RTAs serve nearly 35,000 unlisted companies compared to only about 4,000 listed firms. To avoid overlap, Sebi is of the view that services related to listed companies remain under its purview, while those for unlisted companies fall under the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA). RTAs will also need to ring-fence operations to maintain clear regulatory boundaries. Also, a minimum net worth criterion of Rs 50 lakh at all times has been suggested. Strengthening of Corporate Governance in Exchanges Sebi board may also clear proposals to strengthen the governance of Market Infrastructure Institutions (MIIs) such as stock exchanges, clearing corporations, and depositories. Citing their growing scale, profitability, and role as first-line regulators, Sebi has suggested appointing at least two Executive Directors (EDs) of comparable stature to head key verticals, alongside the Managing Director (MD) on the governing board. Though there is criticism also of the proposal of creating multiple power centres.  While the MD will continue to oversee overall affairs, EDs will manage operations in their verticals, with risk and compliance overseen by the EDs. Key managerial personnel like the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) and Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) will report to the EDs, with defined roles in technology resilience and cybersecurity. Strategic investor for REITs and InvITs Markets regulator is likely to discuss widening the scope of “strategic investors” in Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs) by allowing foreign investors and qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) to participate. Strategic investors, who receive allocations before an issue opens, must invest between 5 percent and 25 percent of the offer size. SEBI plans to align the definition of strategic investors in REIT and InvIT rules with the broader QIB definition under ICDR regulations. This is expected to open the door for provident and pension funds, insurance funds managed by government entities etc. while excluding individual and family office FPIs. The move is expected to boost capital inflows and investor confidence in these asset classes. Separate AIF Scheme for Accredited Investors Sebi board is expected to approve a new type of Alternative Investment Fund (AIF) scheme exclusively for Accredited Investors (“AI-only schemes”) with a lighter regulatory framework. Under the proposal, AI-only schemes would enjoy relaxations such as exemption from pari-passu rights, extended scheme tenure up to five years, no requirement for NISM certification for key personnel, and no limit on the number of investors. It aims to gradually shift from the current minimum commitment model to accreditation status as the primary sophistication metric. Flexibilities to large value funds for Accredited Investors Sebi board may discuss the proposal of significant amendments to AIF regulations to widen investor participation and ease compliance. Proposal includes lowering the minimum investment threshold for Large Value Funds (LVFs) from Rs 70 crore to Rs 25 crore and exempting such funds from mandatory annual audits. By simplifying regulatory requirements, Sebi expects to boost growth in the AIF ecosystem and strengthen its role in channelling long-term capital into diverse sectors of the economy. Easier norms for Investment advisors and research Analysts Sebi board may also clear the proposal with several changes to make it easier for Investment Advisers (IAs) and Research Analysts (RAs) to operate. First, IAs/RAs may share past performance data with clients on request, with a proper disclaimer, until the Past Risk and Return Verification Agency (PaRRVA) becomes operational. Second, IAs can now charge fees for giving a second opinion on assets held with other distributors, with client consent. Third, individual IAs will get more time and flexibility to transition into corporate entities. Fourth, removal of the need for address proof, infrastructure details, credit reports, and net worth documents during registration, may be removed resulting in simplifying the process. Educational qualifications for IA/RA registration may also be relaxed to allow graduates in any discipline, with relevant NISM certifications. Facilitation of participation by resident Indians in FPIs The key proposal is to enable Retail Schemes based in International Financial Services Centres (IFSCs) in India, where resident Indian non-individuals act as sponsors or managers, to register as FPIs. Currently, only Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs) with resident Indian sponsors are allowed. This change aligns contribution limits under Sebi’s FPI Regulations with IFSCA (Fund Management) Regulations. It also aims to allow Indian Mutual Funds to be constituents of FPIs. The proposal seeks to expand opportunities for Indian entities to participate in global investments, promoting more inclusive financial markets. Sebi had floated a consultation paper on the same. Sources said, the proposal of new code of conflict for Sebi board members and officials may not go to the board as the high-level committee is yet to submit its final report. The overall direction of the proposals for board discussion is to Ease of Doing Business under the chairmanship of Tuhin Kanta Pandey. An email sent to Sebi, seeking comments on the proposals did not elicit any response."
74 smallcaps gain between 10-40% as broader indices outperform,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/74-smallcaps-gain-between-10-40-as-broader-indices-outperform-13525959.html,"The broader indices erased some of the previous week losses and outperformed the main indices in the volatile week led by positive data points including PMI data, GST rationalizations, and supportive global markets. For the week, the BSE Sensex index rose 901.11 points or 1.12 percent to finish at 80,710.76, while Nifty50 added 314.15 points or 1.28 percent to close at 24,741. Among broader indices, BSE Largecap, Midcap and Smallcap indices rose 1.4 percent, 1.8 percent, 2.5 percent, respectively. Selling from Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued 10th consecutive week, as they offloaded equities worth Rs 5,666.90 crore. On the other hand, Domestic Institutional Investors (DII) continued their buying in 21th consecutive week, as they purchased equities worth Rs 13,444.09 crore. Among sectors, BSE Metal index added nearly 6 percent, BSE Auto index rose 5.2 percent, BSE Consumer Discretionary index gained 3.6 percent, while BSE Information Technology index shed 1 percent. ""Indian equities opened the week on a strong note but gradually lost steam, ending subdued as optimism around GST rationalisation faded and global trade tensions resurfaced. The IT sector faced the sharpest pressure amid concerns of reduced discretionary spending, driven by economic uncertainty, elevated rates, and geopolitical risks. In contrast, consumer-focused sectors such as Auto and FMCG advanced, supported by expectations that GST cuts will boost domestic consumption and aid demand recovery,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments. ""Global bond markets added to the cautionary mood, with German and French 30-year yields hitting decade highs on rising debt and fiscal imbalances in the Eurozone. Domestically, persistent foreign outflows weighed on the rupee, which slipped to a record low against the U.S. dollar. Meanwhile, safe-haven demand pushed gold prices to all-time highs."" ""Looking ahead, sentiment is likely to remain mixed. Domestic growth-linked sectors stand to benefit from GST relief, resilient consumption, and government spending, while uncertainty over global trade negotiations continues to restrain risk appetite. A multi-asset investment strategy is expected to gain traction in this environment. Market attention remains firmly on the upcoming U.S. jobs report, a key macro trigger that could shape expectations for a potential Fed rate cut. Also, investors will closely track key macro cues, including U.S. nonfarm payrolls, unemployment and inflation data, as well as the ECB’s rate decision, for direction in the week ahead,"" he added. The BSE Small-cap index added 2.5 percent with Netweb Technologies India, One Mobikwik Systems, Jai Corp, Hemisphere Properties India, Vimta Labs, Atul Auto, Gujarat Mineral Development Corporation, Rategain Travel Technologies, Zydus Wellness rising between 20-39 percent.  Where is Nifty50 headed? Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities Technically market action indicates turnaround in the market after a small downward correction of two sessions. We observe bullish pattern like higher highs and lows on the intraday timeframe chart (60 min). The short-term trend of Nifty remains positive with volatility. Having recovered from near the support of 24600, Nifty is expected to advance towards the crucial overhead resistance of 25000 by next week. Immediate support is placed at 24600 levels. Vinay Rajani, Senior Technical & Derivative Research Analyst, HDFC Securities. The short-term trend turned bullish for the Nifty, as it achieved a level above 5, 10 and 20 DEMA. Any level above 25000 would confirm the bullish trend reversal and could lead to further short covering in the index. On the downside, a level around 24500 would continue to serve as support. Amol Athawale, VP Technical Research, Kotak Securities Technically, 24,500/80400 remains a strong support zone for short-term traders. As long as the market trades above this level, the bullish setup remains intact. On the higher side, the 50-day SMA (Simple Moving Average) or 25,000/82000 would act as a crucial resistance zone for traders. A successful breakout above 25,000/82000 could push the market towards 25,200/82600. Conversely, below 24,500/80400, market sentiment could change. If the index falls below this level, it is likely to retest 24,350/79900. Further downside may continue, potentially dragging the index to the 200-day SMA or 24,100/79400.

Jane Street Vs SEBI case shifted to September 9 in SAT,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/jane-street-vs-sebi-case-shifted-to-september-9-in-sat-13524390.html,"The Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) will now hear Jane Street Group’s case on September 9, instead of September 8. A notification on the SAT website stated, “The cases listed for hearing on 8th September 2025 will be taken up on 9th September 2025.” The change followed the Maharashtra Government’s revision of the holiday calendar and a circular from the Central Government Employees' Id-e-Milad Welfare Co-ordination Committee, which declared 8th September 2025 a holiday in place of 5th September 2025 for Mumbai City and Mumbai Suburbs. Legal sources confirmed the rescheduling. The matter was earlier fixed for September 8 and was last mentioned before the tribunal on September 3. As per documents seen by Moneycontrol Jane Street has filed an appeal before SAT seeking directions to SEBI to share documents, emails, and notes relied upon in the investigation that formed the basis of the case against it. A related hearing is also scheduled before SEBI’s Whole-Time Member (WTM) on September 15. Ahead of that, Jane Street has sought access to the documents to prepare its defence. In its prayer, Jane Street Sought directions to SEBI to not take any further action in the case till the disposal of the appeal. SEBI had earlier denied access on August 7, saying there was “no reference of the said documents/correspondences in the Interim Order.” A second request on August 14, 2025, was also rejected, with SEBI stating that the material contained “third-party data” and was confidential. Jane Street has alleged that withholding these documents amounts to suppressing crucial information that goes to the root of the case and violates principles of natural justice. The firm also claimed that SEBI’s surveillance department and the NSE found no evidence of manipulation, but an interdepartmental team was formed on December 31, 2024, with a “pre-determined motive” to build a case against it—without understanding its trading strategy or rationale. In its interim order dated July 3, SEBI had accused Jane Street of manipulating index options using its financial strength and technological edge. The regulator directed the firm to deposit ₹4,843.5 crore in a separate account with a lien in SEBI’s favour. Jane Street complied on July 11. SEBI later lifted restrictions on the firm, while directing exchanges to closely monitor its trades."

Affordable housing seen as unpriced dark horse from cement GST cut,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/affordable-housing-seen-as-unpriced-dark-horse-from-cement-gst-cut-13523542.html,"Affordable housing developers may emerge as the surprise beneficiaries of the government’s sweeping GST cuts, with analysts flagging that the market has yet to factor in the potential margin boost from lower input costs. While cement stocks such as Ultratech Cement, Ambuja Cement and Shree Cements rallied after the GST Council cut the tax rate on cement to 18 percent from 28 percent, the bigger upside could accrue to housing developers, particularly in the budget segment. “The most meaningful gains from the tax cut will flow into real estate,” said independent analyst Ambareesh Baliga. “Cement companies have already absorbed the GST news, but we believe the market hasn’t factored in the nearly Rs 30 per square foot benefit this brings to affordable housing projects.” Motilal Oswal’s Siddhartha Khemka agrees that both cement and real estate stand to gain. He noted that cement makers are already benefiting from robust demand, better realisations and higher Ebitda per tonne, with the GST cut serving as an additional positive trigger. “Going forward, cement players will not hesitate to pass on price hikes to buyers when needed,” he said. ALSO READ: Cement GST rate cut expected to spur festive season demand, cut construction costs On the real estate side, Khemka was cautiously optimistic. Lower input costs can drive a re-rating of affordable housing stocks, which trade at relatively comfortable valuations. But he added that demand in the mid- and affordable segments has yet to show a material pick-up, which will be a key monitorable. Market data highlight that weakness. According to Anarock Research, the share of affordable housing — defined as homes priced below Rs 40 lakh — in overall sales has plunged from 38 percent in 2019 to 18 percent in 2024, while its share in new supply has fallen even more sharply, from 40 percent in 2019 to 12 percent in the first half of 2025. Analysts say the GST cut, if passed on to buyers, could trigger a much-needed revival. Developers are now gearing up for a stronger festive quarter, with experts pointing to a dual advantage: lower construction costs and greater policy clarity. By cutting taxes on cement, marble and granite, the reforms ease cost pressures for developers while enhancing affordability for buyers. Stable interest rates and seasonal demand could amplify the effect, lifting sentiment around the sector’s long-term prospects. “The reduction in rates across a host of items will boost consumption, savings and investment by households, while easing EMI burdens,” said Samir Jasuja, Founder & CEO of PropEquity. “Coupled with falling home loan rates, this move will bring cheer in the festive season and beyond. The overall impact will translate into higher GST collections, increased government spending, and stronger economic growth.” At its 56th meeting, the GST Council cut rates not only on cement but also across building materials. Marble and travertine blocks now attract 5 percent GST, down from 12 percent; granite blocks have been cut to 5 percent from 12 percent; while sand-lime bricks and stone inlay work also saw their levies halved to 5 percent.

"Vodafone Idea shares hit 10% upper circuit on strong volumes, extend gains for third day",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/vodafone-idea-shares-hit-10-upper-circuit-on-strong-volumes-extend-gains-for-third-day-13524289.html,"The shares of Vodafone Idea rallied 10 percent amid a surge in trading volumes. The shares of the telecom giant were locked at the upper circuit at Rs 7.27 apiece, extending gains for the third consecutive session. More than 83 crore shares of the company worth Rs 572 crore have been engaged in trade today, according to data on NSE at 1.50 pm. This is higher than the stock's 10-day average volume. Vodafone Idea shares have gained nearly 11 percent in the past five days, and over 5 percent in the past one month. The stock however has declined 7.5 percent in the past six months, and more than 9 percent in 2025 so far. Earlier yesterday, the Economic Times reported citing people familiar with the matter that the central government is looking for a strategic investor who is willing to commit $1 billion (over Rs 8,800 crore) into debt-ridden Vodafone Idea for a 12-13 percent stake. Promoters Aditya Birla Group (ABG) and UK's Vodafone will have the option to dilute some of their stake as the government wishes to remain invested in the telecom giant for some more time, the report added citing sources. The government wishes that the new investor takes Vodafone Idea forward with new ideas as well, it further said. This is one of the many ways, including AGR relief, that the government is exploring in order to save one of the largest telecom companies in India from shutting down, the report said. The government has identified some potential suitors, and talks are likely to pick up pace in the near future, the report further said. Moneycontrol couldn't independently verify the report. Vodafone Idea has been struggling with debt, owing nearly Rs 83,400 crore in adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues, with annual payments of around Rs 18,000 crore scheduled from March 2025. The debt-laden operator has repeatedly warned that it cannot survive without funding support, as banks remain wary of lending, given its financial stress. Vi employs over 18,000 people and has nearly 198 million subscribers.

Vi has also formally urged the government to settle the AGR matter ahead of the March 2026 deadline, which Moondra said would help reassure banks and unlock financing support. ""Given the fact that we are keen on maintaining a continuity of our capex, which has been going on since last year, we are looking at non-banking sources of funding, also not the full amount of Rs 25,000 crore that we have talked about, but a lesser amount so that we can continue with the capex cycle,"" Moondra said.

Mining major GMDC shares near record high with heavy volumes on Centre's rare earth focus,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/mining-major-gmdc-shares-near-record-high-on-heavy-volumes-on-centre-s-push-for-rare-earths-13524154.html,"Shares of mining major GMDC are sharply higher by over 10 percent on September 5, trading close to its record high with a combined volume of over 2.25 crore shares on NSE and BSE, more than 60x the one-month average a short while ago. In the last one week, the shares are up 25 percent and on YTD basis, the shares are higher by 56 percent. The company has been in focus of late with the Centre planning a concerted push towards rare earth mining to secure supplies, as well as the company's stated plans to foray into new mining ventures. The renewed surge in the sessions comes as CNBC-TV18 reported that India has been in talks with Peru and Chile for critical mineral supplies, and for the first time, a separate chapter on rare earths have been included in the ongoing negotiations of a Free Trade Agreement (FTA). The second round for these negotiations took place last week, and the next set of talks are slated in October.  As the demand for renewable power sector and EVs grows, Centre has been looking to secure supplies of the critical minerals required in these supply chains. As part of the negotiations with the Latin American nations, New Delhi has been seeking preferential rights for these assets. GMDC has lined up a capex of Rs 13,000 crore till 2030, which translates into a steady investment of between Rs 1,500-2,000 crore every year. Approximately Rs 3,000-4,000 crore have been allocated for two critical mineral projects, the company has said. In Odisha, the company has three blocks, the largest being Baitarani West, for which groundbreaking is expected this year, and which GMDC says will in future become the company's largest mine with capacity of 15 MTPA, and likely amongst India's top 12-13 mines. ""We have made our intention that we will be entering the critical mineral space, one is rare earths and the second is copper. A lot of hard work is underway. The value drivers will be rare earths which go towards making permanent magnets,"" Managing Director Roopwant Singh had said in the June quarter earnings call. On September 3, Centre had approved a Rs 1,500 crore incentive scheme to develop recycling capacity in India to separate and produce critical minerals from recycled sources. The scheme will have a six-year tenure from FY26-31 to scrap out critical minerals from e-waste, Lithium Ion Battery (LIB) scrap, catalytic convertors in end-of-life vehicles, among other sources. The incentives will comprise of 20 percent capex subsidy on plant and machinery for starting production, as well as incentive on incremental sales. Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas Hardeep Puri recently said that India has launched explorations at over 1,200 sites and is structuring partnerships for processing and recycling to ensure EVs, renewable power and semiconductors are 'never hostage to external choke-points'. There has also been an increased momentum in R&D activities in exploration, extraction, processing and application of critical minerals essential for green energy transition and strategic sectors. The National Critical Mineral Mission is aiming at 1,000 patents across the critical minerals value chain by FY31, encouraging innovation of indigenous technologies."

The drug has a subcutaneous mode of administration, which the company says promises to make immunotherapy more accessible and convenient for patients. An exchange filing by Glenmark said that it has received approval from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) to commence patient enrollment and dosing in India. The pharma company has already submitted a Clinical Trial Application (CTA) in Russia and is preparing to open additional trial sites in Brazil and Mexico to expand the footprint of the study. Envafolimab is a novel anti-PD-L1 inhibitor that is administered subcutaneously, and was invented by Alphamab Oncology, co-developed with 3D Medicines (Beijing) since 2016. Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) comprising approximately 80-85% of cases, and 20-30% diagnosed at Stage III, Glenmark Pharma has said. While surgery remains an option stage III patients, the pharma company cited poor five-year survival rate, making a case for innovative and accessible immunotherapy options like Envafolimab. ""With its novel subcutaneous administration, Envafolimab has the potential to make cutting-edge immunotherapy more accessible and convenient for patients worldwide, especially in regions where healthcare resources are constrained,"" Dr Monika Tandon, Global Head of Clinical Development, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals said.

"GST Windfall: Where fund managers are buying, where they’re bailing",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/gst-windfall-where-fund-managers-are-buying-where-they-re-bailing-13523490.html,"The sweeping GST 2.0 rate reductions are expected to free up nearly Rs 1.8 trillion in household savings annually, spurring demand across autos, cement, staples, durables and insurance. For fund managers, however, the biggest beneficiaries are precisely the sectors where domestic mutual fund portfolios remain underweight or neutral. Elevated valuations and earlier portfolio repositioning may keep allocations from rising meaningfully in the near term, several fund managers told Moneycontrol. Underweight in key sectors Elara Securities data shows mutual funds are underweight FMCG at -1.4% of AUM, autos are only 0.2–0.3% overweight, and cement 0.1–0.3% overweight. These three are seen as the biggest winners from the GST cuts, but fund managers say sectoral weightages may not rise sharply given steep valuations and the fact that portfolios had already been adjusted last year in anticipation of stronger consumption.  “From a portfolio point of view, it is not just about the uptake but also about valuations and whether further upside is possible. Our approach will remain bottom-up,” said Harsha Upadhyaya, CIO – Equity at Kotak AMC. He added that while tax cuts are positive across the board, demand elasticity will vary by product, making stock selection critical.  Chirag Mehta, CIO at Quantum AMC, agreed allocations will evolve with earnings potential. “Growth dynamics across sectors will change because of the GST cut. That will influence earnings potential, and consequently our portfolio allocations,” he said, adding that the review would be “sector by sector and stock by stock.” He noted that growth in consumer segments has not recovered as expected after income tax cuts earlier this year, so managers will need to see clearer signs of volume growth before deploying money at current valuations. Portfolios already adjusted DSP’s Vinit Sambre said his firm had already rationalized positions last year when capex momentum slowed. “We already have good positioning in these segments — banking, consumer, and some tech-oriented segments — maybe only incremental adjustments, more indirect or proxy plays,” he said. Among investment-oriented sectors, DSP still has exposure largely linked to the power sector, where capex remains strong. ALSO READ: GST 2.0: Beyond blue chips – Watch these under-the-radar movers Overall, Sambre expects a revival in demand across the board. “I believe the automobile sector should see higher price-elasticity-led demand improvement, followed by daily essentials, food and personal care products,” he said. Autos and cement in focus Autos are viewed as the biggest near-term beneficiaries, with GST on two-wheelers, small cars and commercial vehicles cut sharply. Jefferies estimates this could lower on-road prices by 6–8%. Cement, which now attracts 18% GST, is expected to see margin expansion and working capital relief. Durables such as TVs and air-conditioners will also gain from tax relief. In all these sectors, mutual funds are already mildly overweight, but managers say they will wait to see demand pick up and earnings accelerate before increasing exposure further. Mehta said the implications go beyond consumer products. “While the gains are tilted towards consumption, there are broader implications too. Renewable energy will benefit from lower duties, cement duties have been cut which lowers housing input costs, and healthcare demand could rise as health insurance becomes cheaper.” Sambre echoed this, noting that second-order effects will be more critical: “The second-order impact is on credit growth. With consumer demand rising, credit growth should also see a positive impact, and we are already at the lower end of the cycle.” That translates into more bets on banks, apart from stock-specific opportunities across segments, fund managers said. Valuations the sticking point Still, managers caution that valuations remain the decisive factor. “Earnings could improve in the medium to long term, but valuations must still be looked at bottom-up,” Mehta said. Sambre added that much of the news was already in the price. “In fact, on September 4, we saw a negative market reaction, as people were already positioned.” As benefits percolate and consumption trends improve, investors are hoping GST 2.0 will still provide direction to the market.

Asian shares join global rally before US jobs data,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/asian-shares-join-global-rally-before-us-jobs-data-13523071.html,"Asian shares posted early gains Friday after stocks and bonds rallied on Wall Street as further signs of a cooling labor market reinforced bets the Federal Reserve will cut rates this month. Stocks rose in Japan, Australia and South Korea at the open. The Nikkei-225 index rose by more than 1% after President Donald Trump signed an executive order implementing his trade agreement with Japan. The S&P 500 added 0.8% to reach a new peak while the Nasdaq 100 rose 0.9%. Treasuries extended a Thursday rally that saw the policy-sensitive US two-year yield fall three basis points to the lowest in around a year. Money markets are now almost fully pricing in a Fed reduction this month and see at least two by year-end. The action reflected the latest readings on hiring and unemployment claims before Friday’s jobs data, which is expected to extend the weakest stretch of US job growth since the pandemic. Slowing demand, rising costs and Trump’s unpredictable trade policies have cooled hiring, adding pressure on the Fed to shore up the labor market. “Many investors are clearly hoping for rate cuts, but it is important to remember to be careful what we wish for,” said Steve Sosnick at Interactive Brokers. “Data that show a gently decelerating but not dire labor market would suit that goal. Plunging data might bias the Fed to further cuts, but could also raise concerns that the central bank is too far behind the curve.” Elsewhere, Trump signed an executive order Thursday implementing his trade agreement with Japan, under which the US will impose a maximum 15% tariff on most of its products. China’s stock markets will once again be in focus after shares fell more than 2% Thursday. The country’s financial regulators are considering a number of cooling measures for the stock market as they grow concerned about the speed of recent gains. Meanwhile, traders are now positioning themselves for the key jobs reading. Consensus forecasts peg nonfarm payrolls having grown 75,000 in August, which would mark a fourth straight month of job growth below 100,000. The unemployment rate is seen rising to 4.3% — the highest level since 2021. In the run-up to the data, figures showed US jobless claims rose to the highest since June. Private-sector payrolls increased by 54,000, according to ADP Research data, missing estimates. Hiring plans fell to the weakest level for any August on record, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas. “The Federal Reserve’s free pass on the labor market has ended,” said Jamie Cox at Harris Financial Group. “You can expect the Fed to tilt its balance of risks to cut rates in September.” Lackluster employment figures released after the July meeting have prompted greater concern, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell recently signaled a rate cut could be warranted, citing a “shifting balance of risks.” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said in a speech last week that the data support the view that “labor demand may be on the edge of a sharp decline,” a trend he argued monetary policy should address. Waller has been one of the most vocal Fed governors favoring interest-rate cuts to guard against an outright deterioration in the job market. On Wednesday, he suggested the possibility of multiple reductions in borrowing costs by the end of the year. Gold edged higher Friday, while oil extended losses into a third session against the backdrop of concerns OPEC+ may bolster supply at a meeting on Sunday."

The breakout is supported by robust volume, surpassing typical levels, and the stock displays strong relative strength compared to Nifty and the broader market. Trend indicators point to sustained bullish momentum in the near term. The price is above all key EMAs, which are converging in a tight range, potentially providing solid support ahead.

Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 215, Rs 220 Stop-Loss: Rs 182.5 Devyani International | CMP: Rs 179.3  Devyani this week broke out above a tight consolidation zone, where it had been confined for the past six sessions, marked by multiple Spinning Top candlestick patterns signaling indecision. The bulls ultimately prevailed, and the breakout is supported by a surge in positive volume. In recent sessions, several positive volume surges have also been witnessed, reflecting robust buying interest and good accumulation at lower levels. The stock exhibits strong relative strength, and trend indicators point to sustained bullish momentum.

Daily and weekly momentum indicators reinforce a bullish trend, with a move above Rs 182.5 likely to propel further upside. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 195, Rs 206 Stop-Loss: Rs 166.5 Mandar Bhojane, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst at Choice Broking IDFC First Bank | CMP: Rs 72.23  IDFC First Bank has recently broken out of a double bottom pattern on the daily chart, supported by strong trading volumes, indicating the emergence of a potential bullish trend. A sustained move above Rs 73 could open the way for short-term targets of Rs 76 and Rs 83. On the downside, immediate support lies at Rs 70, making it a good level to accumulate on dips. The RSI is currently at 60 and trending higher, reflecting growing buying momentum. For prudent risk management, a stop-loss at Rs 70 is advised to safeguard against unexpected reversals. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 76, Rs 83 Stop-Loss: Rs 67.5 Apollo Hospitals Enterprise | CMP: Rs 7,900  Apollo Hospitals Enterprise has broken out and is currently retesting near a fresh breakout zone on the daily chart, accompanied by a notable rise in trading volumes, indicating strong bullish momentum. A decisive close above Rs 7,950 could open the path toward short-term targets of Rs 8,555. On the downside, immediate support is placed at Rs 7,750, providing attractive buying opportunities on dips. The RSI stands at 64 and is trending upward, confirming strengthening buying interest. For risk management, a stop-loss at Rs 7,580 is recommended to guard against potential reversals. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 8,555 Stop-Loss: Rs 7,580 KEC International | CMP: Rs 861.15  KEC International has broken out and retested its falling trendline on the daily chart, supported by a notable rise in trading volumes. This breakout indicates the possibility of a bullish reversal. A sustained close above Rs 870 could set the stage for short-term targets of Rs 950.

For prudent risk management, a stop-loss at Rs 819 is advised to protect against unexpected reversals.

The stock has been consolidating in a broad range over the past few weeks, and the recent up-move has lifted it above all major moving averages, strengthening the short-term trend. The RSI has moved up to 60, entering bullish territory, while the MACD has given a positive crossover and continues in a strong upward trajectory. These signals, along with a series of higher closes in recent sessions, point toward a continuation of strength. The stock has also given a strong breakout from the declining trendline on the daily chart and is now holding above the previous resistance zone, which further supports the positive outlook. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,650 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,530 Thermax | CMP: Rs 3,341.90  Thermax displayed notable strength in the last session, closing above the 20-SMA for the first time in several weeks. This recovery comes after an extended phase of sideways consolidation near the Rs 3,200 base. The momentum indicators are also turning favourable. The RSI has improved to 49, edging closer to the neutral line and indicating that strength is gradually returning to the stock. At the same time, the MACD has generated a positive crossover, supported by green histogram bars. The stock appears to be forming a saucer pattern, which is considered a bullish formation that often precedes a sustained upward move. The rise in volume participation on the hourly chart further adds confirmation.

"Jane Street’s SAT appeal says Sebi sat on escrow, algo firm’s no-trade conduct out of good faith",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/jane-street-s-sat-appeal-says-sebi-sat-on-escrow-algo-firm-s-no-trade-conduct-out-of-good-faith-13522034.html,"Global trading firm Jane Street in its appeal before the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) has submitted that it deliberately refrained from fresh trades even after regulator Sebi’s restrictions were lifted, underscoring what it described as bona fide conduct, documents seen by Moneycontrol have revealed. The firm, which deposited Rs 4,843.5 crore in an escrow account as directed by Sebi, said its restraint reflected ‘abundant caution’ despite strongly disagreeing with the regulator’s findings. Some market participants have viewed this as a positive gesture from Jane Street, reflecting the firm’s intent to remain in good faith with the regulator and exchanges. In its petition, Jane Street levelled multiple charges against Sebi’s process: 1. Ignoring prior submissions The firm stressed that it had voluntarily explained its trading strategies to Sebi well before the interim order. Representatives of Jane Street entities held multiple calls in August 2024 and presented via video conference on August 20, 2024, giving regulators an overview of its index options strategies and specific explanations of trades on October 18, 2023, and January 17, 2024. Jane Street argued that this information was ignored by the inter-departmental team formed on December 31, 2024, which prepared the order without the benefit of those prior inputs. 2. Lack of regulatory guidance Jane Street said it had repeatedly sought clarity from Sebi and NSE about what constituted ‘large’ delta exposures after being cautioned on its positions. Sebi’s own notes, the firm claimed, showed that NSE had in February 2025 sought guidance from Sebi on this very issue, but no instructions were ever communicated back. The firm maintained that this absence of regulatory direction left its bona fide attempts at compliance unacknowledged. People familiar with regulatory matters suggest that such guidance may not be necessary, as entities are expected to interpret it themselves by analysing trade data and patterns. There are also concerns that, at times, any guidance provided could later be used against them. Also Read: Jane Street challenges SEBI in SAT; hearing on September 8 3. Withholding of key documents Jane Street said several crucial documents, email correspondences, and annexures referenced in Sebi’s internal notes were never shared with it. According to the firm, some of these communications appeared to have been exchanged after reports from NSE and Sebi’s Integrated Surveillance Department (ISD) had initially found no evidence of manipulation. Despite this, Sebi later reversed its stance. Jane Street also complained that Sebi closed the inspection process unilaterally, denying it access to what it described as ‘the most relevant and material documents’. As per Jane Street’s appeal, Sebi claimed these documents and emails as internal communication and denied access. 4. Delay in lifting restrictions Jane Street has alleged intentional delay by Sebi in acknowledging the escrow deposit. The firm argued that the July 3 interim order had provided for an automatic lifting of restrictions once the deposit was made. However, the market regulator allegedly took 10 working days to restore its trading rights, even after receiving Rs 4,843.5 crore in an account marked in its favour. The firm contended this delay caused undue prejudice and undermined procedural fairness. Legal experts had then questioned the unusual delay from Sebi, as the issue was taking much more time than anticipated. Counter view But there are counter views as well. Some of the issues raised by Jane Street may be valid but not all can be relied on completely, said one legal expert. One former regulatory official said investigations are dynamic by nature. “In the course of investigation, there is no pre-conceived line. The direction of investigation changes as new facts emerge. So, questioning why Sebi abandoned the previous report may not be justified.” Also Read: Sebi Chairman urges listed banks to strengthen insider trading compliance, follow two SDD structure Sebi's stance In its July 3 interim order, SEBI alleged Jane Street manipulated index options by exploiting its financial muscle and trading technology to influence prices in both futures and cash markets on expiry days. The order said this resulted in ‘egregious distortion’ of fairness in the securities market, marking a rare case where multiple liquid stocks with high retail participation were allegedly manipulated to benefit index option positions. The case will next be heard by the SAT on September 8. Interestingly the next date scheduled for hearing before SEBI WTM is scheduled for September 15. Jane Street declined to comment on the issue. An email seeking comments from Sebi did not elicit any response."

"Taking Stock: Market fails to cheer GST reforms; Sensex, Nifty off day’s high",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/taking-stock-market-fails-to-cheer-gst-reforms-sensex-nifty-off-day-s-high-13520493.html,"The Indian equity market extended the gains on second day with Nifty finishing above 24,700 led by auto, FMCG and consumption-oriented stocks post Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council announced rate rationalisation. On Wednesday, the GST Council agreed to cut GST slabs to two, 5% and 18%, effectively September 22, eliminating the existing 12% and 28% slabs. On the back of positive global cues and GST reforms, the market opened on strong note but as the day progress indices witnessed profit booking but manages to close in the positive territory. At close, the Sensex was up 150.30 or 0.19 percent at 80,718.01 and the Nifty was up 19.25 points or 0.08 percent at 24,734.30. BSE Midcap and smallcap indices shed 0.6 percent each.

Click to View More Outlook for September 5 Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets witnessed a volatile session and ended marginally higher, supported by sweeping GST reforms that signaled a structural tax overhaul. The Nifty opened on a strong note, led by sharp gains in auto and consumer staples, but profit-taking and weakness in select heavyweights dragged the index lower as the day progressed. Eventually, it closed with modest gains at 24,734.30. Sector-wise, auto, financials, and FMCG led the advance, while IT, energy, and realty were the notable laggards. The broader indices, however, underperformed after the recent upmove, losing over half a percent each. The GST 2.0 reforms strengthen the case for a consumption-led recovery, with auto and consumer staples expected to benefit the most. Select metals and infrastructure names linked to rural stimulus also remain in focus. That said, the broader outlook stays vulnerable to global macro uncertainties, continued FII outflows, and persistent U.S. tariff headwinds. In the near term, consolidation in the benchmark index cannot be ruled out. Hence, we recommend maintaining selective exposure to structurally strong themes while keeping a close eye on the risk–reward equation. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The Nifty pared most of its gains after a gap-up start driven by optimism over GST reforms. The daily close was just below the 21 EMA, indicating a continuation of weakness, although the index appears to be nearing a potential trend reversal. A decisive move above 24,750 could provide the strength needed for the Nifty to move towards 25,000. A sustained move above 25,000 could trigger a further rally. On the other hand, failure to close above 24,750 within the next two to three days may lead to renewed selling pressure on the index.

"Midcap index down nearly 2% from highs as GST cheer fades, three-day rally snaps: Top losers",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/midcap-index-down-nearly-2-from-highs-as-gst-cheer-fades-three-day-rally-snaps-top-losers-13521152.html,"Shares of several broader market names from the small and midcap space fell on September 4 despite an initial cheer following the GST rate cuts, with both Nifty Midcap and Nifty Smallcap indices down nearly 2 percent in the session, underperforming the benchmark Nifty 50 index. Ola Electric shares were the top loser on the midcap index, dropping nearly 8 percent as investors likely booked profits at elevated levels. This comes after the stock rallied around 77 percent in just half a month. Max Financial Services shares fell nearly 4 percent, and Paytm shares fell 3.5 percent amid the buzz of rival PhonePe's initial public offering (IPO). Exide Industries and Cochin Shipyard shares plunged more than 3 percent each. AU Small Finance Bank and Sona BLW Precision Forgings shares fell around 3 percent, while BHEL, UPL, Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL), Kalyan Jewellers and Coforge shares fell around 2 percent each. Other notable midcap losers include Federal Bank, Bharat Dynamics (BDL), Oil India, Premier Energies, Ashok Leyland, NHPC, Voltas, Solar Industries and more. On the smallcap index, defence stocks like Data Patterns, Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers (GRSE) and BEML were the top losers, falling more than 3 percent each, as the pack saw profit booking after a four-day gaining streak. Karur Vysya Bank and IRCON shares fell nearly 3 percent, while NCC, HFCL, ITI, Chambal Fertilisers, Anant Raj, Poonawalla Fincorp, Radico Khaitan, Hindustan Copper, FirstCry-parent Brainbees Solutions, RITES, Sagility India, Welspun Living and others fell nearly 2 percent each. ""Small- and mid-cap stocks corrected today even as GST reforms created a positive backdrop. The key reason was the weekly Sensex expiry, which naturally added volatility and led to some short-term unwinding. In addition, traders booked profits after the strong rally these segments have enjoyed in recent weeks, following the classic ‘sell on good news’ pattern. Structurally, the GST cuts are a strong tailwind for consumption, especially in rural and semi-urban categories, and once the expiry-led volatility fades, the broader market should benefit. This looks more like a healthy pause than a trend reversal, with fundamentals still pointing towards strength in small- and mid-caps,"" said Harshal Dasani, Business Head, INVasset PMS. ""Even as there are robust mutual fund inflows, small- and mid-cap spaces are disappointing—Nifty Midcap 150 has yielded only 0.7% return this year, while Nifty Smallcap 250 has fallen 4.4%, even as the overall Nifty 50 is up by 4.5%. At the same time, Q1 earnings highlight the agony: small-cap margins are at a nine-quarter low of 7.5%, and mid-caps trail further behind with only 1% growth, compared to 9.5% for large caps. The divergence points to lingering valuation issues and institutions' rotation into defensive large-cap sectors,"" said Siddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director, Vibhavangal Anukulakara Pvt. Ltd. ""The downturn seen in small caps and mid caps is a continuation of the correction seen over the last few months, post the euphoric gains seen last year. While the GST gain will help the mid and small caps, the underlying issue in terms of GST filing complications and working capital impact in terms of ITC refunds impacts MSMEs more. These concerns remain. In addition, the global uncertainty and tariffs, which may lead to lower exports especially for companies targeting America, are also impacting sentiment. We expect broader markets to stabilise and might wait for a trigger like an India-US deal to get them moving significantly upwards,"" said Shravan Shetty, Managing Director, Primus Partners.

Delta Corp shares however plunged 7 percent. During its meeting which concluded on September 3, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council reduced the GST rate on pre-packaged and labelled namkeens, bhujia, mixture, chabena and similar edible items from 12 percent to 5 percent. This will likely spur demand, benefitting these companies. Prataap Snacks shares gained more than 3 percent, while Bikaji Foods and Gopal Snacks shares were up around 2 percent each. ""The sharp, broad-based reduction in the GST rates of most food and key personal care categories could revive consumption partially. Easing commodity prices (tea palm, coffee), good monsoon, favorable base for urban consumption, the recent personal income tax reduction and the upcoming pay commission augur well for FMCG consumption in the next 12-15 months. Lastly, this GST-rate cut would offer some headroom for price increases in the medium term (2HFY27/FY2028),"" said Amit Agarwal, SVP- Fundamental Research, Kotak Securities. Delta Corp shares meanwhile plunged nearly 7 percent. This comes after the GST Council decided to increase the tax levied on admission to casinos, race clubs, any place having casinos or race clubs, or sporting events like the IPL from 28 percent to 40 percent. Delta Corp is India's largest listed casino and gaming company. Hence, the shares of the company tumbled on the GST hike on casinos. The stock has now snapped a two day gaining streak. It earlier sharply fell after government's new online gaming law that has imposed a blanket ban on real-money games.

The GST reduction is expected to provide significant relief to the real estate and infrastructure sectors. Analysts said it could boost demand in the housing segment, as lower construction costs may be passed on to buyers, making homes more affordable. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog The new GST rate will take effect from September 22, 2025, and applies to all major categories of cement, including Portland cement, aluminous cement, slag cement, super sulphate cement, and similar hydraulic cements, whether coloured or in clinker form. These products, previously taxed under the highest 28 percent slab, will now fall under the 18 percent bracket. The reduced tax burden is likely to lead to lower retail cement prices, potentially spurring higher offtake from both retail and institutional buyers. Global brokerage Jefferies described the GST cut on cement as a strong positive for the sector, calling it a long-awaited move that could structurally improve industry dynamics. While Jefferies does not expect a major surge in demand purely from price elasticity, it noted that the new tax regime could aid pricing discipline and support profitability in the medium term. The brokerage also highlighted that companies will now be able to claim full input tax credit on coal—a key raw material—following the increase of GST on coal to 18 percent from 5 percent.

During its meeting which concluded on September 3, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council reduced the GST rate on apparel priced up to Rs 2,500 to 5 percent. Previously, apparel priced up to Rs 1,000 fell under the 5 percent tax bracket, while those beyond that were charged 12 percent GST.

Trent shares jumped more than 3 percent to trade at 5,660 apiece. The stock has gained nearly 7 percent in the past five days, and over 13 percent in the past six months.

The Nifty Auto index rose over 2 percent, emerging as the top-performing sector in early trade, with 14 of its 15 constituents trading in positive territory. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog Saji John, equity research analyst at Geojit BNP Paribas, highlighted that the GST benefits are likely to be broad-based. “Around 64 percent of demand in the passenger vehicle segment comes from small cars, with Maruti Suzuki set to be the largest beneficiary. On the two-wheeler side, motorcycles under 350cc will gain from the tax relief, making Hero MotoCorp a top pick. Commercial vehicles are also expected to see a momentum pickup in the second half of this fiscal, supported by healthy GDP growth and lower taxes,” he said. Under the revised GST structure, small cars—vehicles under four meters in length with petrol engines up to 1,200cc or diesel engines up to 1,500cc—will now attract an 18 percent GST, down from 28–31 percent previously. Large SUVs over four meters will face a 40 percent tax, reduced from 43–50 percent earlier. Electric vehicles remain under the concessional 5 percent GST. Two-wheelers under 350cc will be taxed at 18 percent versus 28 percent earlier, while motorcycles above 350cc are taxed at 40 percent. Commercial vehicles, including trucks, buses, and ambulances, will now attract 18 percent GST, down from 28 percent.

The sharp rise in the share prices pushed the Nifty Auto index up more than 3 percent. The Nifty Auto index was hovering around 26,612.20, the highest level seen in nearly 11 months. During its meeting which concluded on September 3, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council reduced the GST rate on all small cars from 28 percent to 18 percent. This includes petrol, LPG or CNG cars with engine capacity up to 1200 cc and length up to 4000 mm, and diesel cars with engine capacity up to 1500 cc and length up to 4000 mm. The 10-point cut is expected to shave 5-7 percent off ex-showroom prices of popular models such as Maruti Swift, Hyundai i10, Tata Punch and compact SUVs like the Brezza and Venue. While small hybrids that qualify as small cars will also benefit from the 18 percent slab, larger petrol-electric and diesel-electric hybrids have been pushed into the top tax bracket. GST on auto Vehicles with engines above 1200cc (for petrol) or 1500cc (for diesel), or length exceeding four metres, will now attract 40 percent GST, up from 28 percent. Pure EVs remain taxed at just 5 percent, signalling the government's preference for direct EV adoption. However, removal of cess that was previously applicable over and above the GST, is likely to result in marginal relief for premium and luxury vehicles as well as for hybrids. Cess, in the range of 1 percent to 22 percent was earlier charged above the 28 percent GST rate for different class of vehicles. This cess will now no longer be applicable, helping some categories of large vehicles to benefit from this move, despite GST rate moving up to 40 percent. Premium and luxury vehicles remain heavily taxed, with cars and SUVs that fall outside the small car definition continuing in the 40 percent bracket. Motorcycles above 350cc will also face 40 percent GST, up from 28 percent, while two-wheelers up to 350cc, three-wheelers and ambulances will shift to the lower 18 percent rate. Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) shares gained nearly 7 percent to trade at Rs 3,505 apiece, while Eicher Motors, Tata Motors and Maruti Suzuki shares rose more than 2 percent each. TVS Motors, Hero MotoCorp and others meanwhile were up around 1 percent each. Escorts Kubota shares meanwhile rallied nearly 9 percent in early trading hours.

By rationalising slabs and lowering rates on mass categories while taxing sin goods higher, the Council has unlocked volume tailwinds for staples, durables and autos—reshaping equity market leadership in the coming years,"" said Trideep Bhattacharya, President and CIO- Equities Edelweiss MF. ""The GST rate cuts come at the right time which is just ahead of the festive season and against the backdrop of US tariff tiffs. Lower taxes on essentials, FMCG products, autos and cement will leave consumers with more money in hand. This should directly boost demand, help traders and businesses see higher volumes, and may even favourably impact next quarter’s earnings. It also carries the potential to ease inflation. The key will be how quickly companies pass on the benefits to customers and if done well, this move can lift both sentiment and spending,"" said Santosh Meena, Head of Research at Swastika Investmart.

"GST reset fuels demand hopes: M&M, Maruti, Hero Moto, Eicher Motors, Escorts among beneficiaries",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/gst-reset-fuels-demand-hopes-m-m-maruti-hero-moto-escorts-ashok-leyland-among-beneficiaries-13518385.html,"Auto stocks such as Mahindra & Mahindra, Maruti Suzuki India, Hyundai Motor India, Hero MotoCorp, Eicher Motors, Ashok Leyland, and Escorts Kubota are likely to be the biggest beneficiaries of the new GST tax reforms, as sweeping rate cuts have been announced across categories - from hatchbacks and SUVs to tractors and commercial vehicles. Analysts believe the tax relief will trigger a 5 to 10 percent demand surge across multiple segments, setting the stage for a potential re-rating of auto stocks in the medium term. Nomura analysts forecasted volume growth of 3 percent YoY for passenger vehicles and 5 percent YoY for two-wheelers in FY26F, but expect an additional 5 to 10 percent volume uplift following the GST cuts. Shridhar Kallani, auto analyst at Axis Securities, described the decision as “very positive” for the sector. He noted that the small passenger vehicle segment, which has been in prolonged decline over the past 18 to 24 months, may finally be nearing a bottom, while entry-level motorcycles could also be poised for recovery after several quarters of weakness. Passenger vehicles: small cars and SUVs get a boost Under the revised GST structure, small cars - defined as vehicles under four meters in length with petrol engines up to 1,200cc or diesel engines up to 1,500cc will now be taxed at 18 percent, down sharply from 28 to 31 percent earlier. Large SUVs (over four meters) will attract a 40 percent GST rate, compared with 43 to 50 percent previously, while electric vehicles continue under the concessional 5 percent rate. Analysts at Emkay noted that the meaningful reduction in on-road prices is expected to revive sales in the mass-market passenger vehicle segment and re-energise overall demand. Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) emerges as the largest beneficiary, enjoying a 10 percent GST cut across its portfolio. Roughly two-thirds of its models now fall in the 40 percent slab versus 50 percent earlier (including cess), while the remaining portfolio moves to 18 percent from 28 percent. Maruti Suzuki (MSIL) and Hyundai Motor India (HMIL) are also expected to reap sizeable benefits, with blended GST reductions of 7 to 8 percent across their offerings. For both companies, nearly one-third of the portfolio will see a 3 to 5 percent cut, while the other two-thirds enjoy reductions closer to 10 percent. Two-wheelers: fresh spark for under-350cc bikes The new GST rates for two-wheelers lower taxation on motorcycles under 350cc to 18 percent from 28 percent earlier, while those above 350cc are taxed at 40 percent. Kallani of Axis Securities, estimated that the cuts could result in a 7 to 9 percent decline in on-road prices. With two-wheeler volumes still trailing the FY19 peak, analysts believe this tax cut has the potential to trigger a much-needed fresh growth cycle. According to Emkay, the benefits will be broad-based across leading manufacturers. Hero MotoCorp (HMCL) will enjoy a 10 percent cut across 94 percent of its portfolio volumes, while Eicher Motors’ Royal Enfield brand will benefit from a similar 10 percent cut on 81 percent of its models. TVS Motor Company (TVSL) gains from a 10 percent reduction across 70 percent of its range, while Bajaj Auto secures benefits on 49 percent of its portfolio, expanding to 65 percent when three-wheelers are included. Despite the higher GST of 40 percent now levied on models above 350cc, Royal Enfield remains a clear net gainer, with 81 percent of its portfolio benefiting, and only 8 percent adversely impacted by the hike, analysts said. Tractors and CVs join the GST party The GST cut for commercial vehicles, including trucks, buses, and ambulances, to 18 percent from 28 percent earlier, is expected to lower on-road prices by up to 10 percent, according to Kallani. This makes fleet renewal more affordable, encouraging operators to expand capacity. Beyond the direct sales impact, the move could yield wider economic benefits by enhancing goods movement, improving logistics efficiency, and reducing overall transportation costs. Perhaps the most significant, particularly from a rural perspective, is the cut in GST on tractors and agricultural machinery to 5 percent from 12 percent. The steep reduction directly lowers acquisition costs for farmers, thereby enhancing affordability. Kallani highlighted M&M, Escorts (ESC), and VST Tillers as the major beneficiaries in Farm and Equipments space.

Here is how financial markets across the globe fared overnight: GIFT Nifty (Gains) The GIFT Nifty is trading higher at around 24,947, indicating a strong start for the day. Asian Equities (Up) Asian equities were primed to rise Thursday after weak US job openings reinforced bets on a Federal Reserve interest-rate cut, boosting stocks and bonds on Wall Street.  US Equities (Up) Wall Street stocks recovered some ground on Wednesday after technology conglomerate Alphabet rose on a favorable antitrust ruling, but gains were muted as investors digested softer-than-expected labor market data and a selloff in long-term global government bonds. Job openings, a measure of labor demand, dropped 176,000 to 7.181 million by the last day of July, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said in its ""JOLTS"" report on Wednesday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 7.378 million unfilled jobs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.05%, the S&P 500 rose 0.5%, and the Nasdaq Composite added about 1%.  US Bond Yield (Down) The yield on 10-year Treasuries and 2-year Treasuries were trading lower in the early trade on Thursday.  Dollar Index (Flat) The U.S. dollar softened on Thursday in a volatile week as investors contended with bond market jitters while weighing data that showed a weakening labour market, which reinforced expectations the Federal Reserve will cut rates this month.  Asian currencies (Mixed) Asian currencies were trading mixed in the early trade on Thursday. However, on a year-to-date basis, except the Indonesian Rupiah, all other currencies gained between 1-7 percent.  Crude (Down) Oil fell after a report that the OPEC+ alliance will consider a fresh round of production increaseswhen the group meets over the weekend.  Gold (Flat) Gold held near an all-time high after a seven-day rally, as weak US data spurred more bets on aninterest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve this month and mounting concerns over the central bank’s independence underpinned haven demand.  Fund Flow Action The Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) extended their selling on the eighth day as they sold equities worth Rs 1,666 crore on September 03, while Domestic institutional investors (DIIs) continued their selling on the seventh consecutive session as they purchased equities worth Rs 2495 crore on the same day.  Hope you're all set for today's trade. We wish you a profitable day ahead.

Asian stocks rise as weak US jobs fuel Fed bets,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/asian-stocks-to-rise-as-weak-us-jobs-fuel-fed-bets-13518338.html,"Asian equities climbed with Wall Street after weak US job openings data reinforced bets on a Federal Reserve interest-rate cut. Shares in Japan, Australia and South Korea gained at the open. Equity-index futures for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 edged higher after both gauges advanced. Australian bonds tracked Wednesday’s moves in Treasuries, with yields on the 10-year declining almost five basis points to 4.37%. Oil dipped, while gold steadied. With job openings falling to a 10-month low, traders are now almost fully pricing in a September Fed cut and projecting at least two reductions this year. The shift lifted equities, snapping a two-day losing streak for US stocks, and supported Treasuries a day before a pivotal US payrolls report. The data is “another sign that the labour market is slowing down,” wrote Kyle Rodda, a senior market analyst at Capital.com in Melbourne. “The dynamic boosts the case for rate cuts.” Economists project about 75,000 jobs were added in August, based on the median of a Bloomberg survey, while the jobless rate is seen at 4.3%. Four straight months of sub-100,000 payrolls growth would mark the weakest such stretch since the onset of the pandemic in 2020. “A large downside surprise in labor market data could push rates sharply lower given the concern around the Fed’s labor mandate,” said TD Securities strategists including Oscar Munoz and Gennadiy Goldberg. “We remain biased long on dips and expect rates to move lower throughout the year.” Also, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said on CNBC that the central bank should begin lowering rates in September and make multiple cuts in coming months, adding that officials could debate the precise pace of reductions. Investors will also focus on a bond auction in Japan Thursday, which faces added uncertainty from a global debt market turmoil and political instability at home. Meanwhile, borrowers from across the globe are rushing into the bond market, with more than $128 billion of sales so far this week, and investors are lapping up the new debt."
"Markets likely to react positively to GST booster dose for FMCG, auto, insurance, consumer durables and MSMEs, say experts",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/markets-likely-to-react-positively-to-gst-booster-dose-for-fmcg-auto-insurance-consumer-durables-and-msmes-say-experts-13518332.html,"With the government announcing major cuts in GST rates for various sectors including auto, FMCG and consumer durables, the market is expected to react positively to the decisions that many are calling a ‘historic Diwali gift’, say experts. They add that the decision of merging rates into 5% and 18% -- while reserving 40% for sin goods -- will benefit many sectors like FMCG, auto, insurance, consumer durables and MSMEs among others ahead of the festive season. “The new GST regime merges slabs into 5% and 18%, with 40% for luxury goods. Essentials, durables, and insurance see major tax relief. Sectors like FMCG, auto, insurance, and MSMEs will benefit, driving demand, easing compliance, and supporting economic growth ahead of the festive season,” said Ninad Jadhav, Equity Research Analyst, LKP Securities. Also Read: 'Historic Diwali gift' for common man, students, farmers: How new GST reforms will impact you? In a similar context, Vineet Gala, Founder at Xylem PMS, said that the overall package is “very positive."" ""By removing the 12% and 28% slabs, the move reduces ambiguity and aligns India with global best practices,” he said while adding that the sentiment has already turned constructive, with “clear benefits for consumption-driven sectors such as textiles, apparel, footwear and FMCG.” According to him, lower taxes on footwear and clothing up to Rs 2,500 are expected to spur festive demand, while exemptions for senior citizens’ health insurance and cuts on life-saving drugs strengthen the welfare push. Adding a note of caution, Rohit Beri, CEO & CIO at ArthAlpha, said while the dual structure of 5% and 18% is a welcome move, “the devil will be in the detail. The 5% slab usually does not allow input tax credit, so in some cases 12% with ITC was better than 5% without it.” On footwear, he highlighted that raising the concessional limit from ₹1,000 to ₹2,500 effectively extends relief to the “mass affluent” category, potentially giving a broader consumption push. “The council’s assurance of clearing refunds under the inverted duty structure within seven days is another boost. Though businesses will face short-term adjustments around pricing, stock revaluation and compliance, the overall direction is market-friendly, pro-consumption and supportive of long-term growth,” said Gala. Also Read: Big tax reform: GST slabs reduced to two; hundreds of items set to get cheaper from September 22 Among food items, cheese, butter, ghee, oil, confectionary, chocolates, pasta, pastry, cakes, biscuits, coffee, ice cream, jams, drinking water, fruit juice, and beverages containing milk will see a lower GST from September 22. Also Read: From soaps to snacks: GST cut to 5% to boost FMCG demand ahead of festive season Further, GST on several household products has been slashed from higher slabs to just 5%. Hair oil, shampoo, toothpaste, toilet soaps, shaving cream and toothbrushes will now attract 5% down from the earlier 18%. Vikas Gupta, CEO and Chief Investment Strategist at Omniscience Capital, said the footwear and apparel cuts would have a “double impact” on both demand and supply. “Consumers are likely to benefit from lower prices, driving higher volume demand. Exporters impacted by US tariffs can also redirect some supply to the large domestic market, where even marginal increases in demand will be enough to absorb the pressure,” he said. He pointed out that India’s domestic market for footwear, at nearly $30 to 35 billion, dwarfs its $300-500 million US exports. “Similarly, textile exports to the US stand at $10 billion, while the domestic market is around $110 billion, making local absorption feasible,” Gupta said while adding that the government’s commitment to fast-tracking refunds would improve liquidity and sentiment. “It clearly shows determination to mitigate and counter the impact of US tariffs. We should expect more such steps going forward.” Incidentally, the Confederation of Indian Textile Industry (CITI) has welcomed the government’s decision of aligning the GST on MMF fibre and yarn at 5% from 18% and 12% earlier, respectively. “It addresses the long-standing blockage of working capital for thousands of spinners and weavers. With over 70-80% of textile and apparel units in India being MSMEs, this reform will directly benefit a large segment of the industry by easing liquidity pressures, enhancing competitiveness,” said Rakesh Mehra, Chairman, CITI. Also Read: Diwali comes early for auto sector: GST slashed on small cars, 2Ws, 3Ws, CVs Meanwhile, vehicles have also seen major rationalisation. Petrol, diesel and CNG cars in specified categories, earlier taxed at 28%, will now attract 18%. Three-wheelers, motorcycles up to 350cc and commercial vehicles for goods transport as well will come in the 18% bracket. Consumer durables will also see noticeable price drops. Air conditioners, televisions above 32 inches (including LED and LCD), monitors, projectors and dishwashers have all been brought down from 28% to 18%. According to Karthik Mani, Partner - Indirect tax, BDO India, apart from rate rationalisation, the GST Council has also made some important changes in the GST laws to ease the process of obtaining registrations for small businesses supplying through e-commerce platforms and also for quick grant of refunds on provisional basis. “Another important announcement is commencement of filing appeals before the GSTAT by September and commencement of hearing before the end of the calendar year, which resolves a long-standing demand of the taxpayers,” he said.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Coal India, ITC Hotels, GMDC, Pondy Oxides, Paytm, Glenmark Pharma, HDFC Bank, and others on September 04?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-coal-india-itc-hotels-gmdc-pondy-oxides-paytm-glenmark-pharma-hdfc-bank-and-others-on-september-04-13518319.html,"The benchmark indices rebounded after a day of profit booking, rising more than half a percent on September 3. Bulls continued to support the market breadth for the third straight day, with about 1,884 shares advancing compared to 894 declining shares on the NSE. The uptrend is expected to strengthen if the frontline indices decisively surpass short- and medium-term moving averages. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Nilesh Jain, Head- Equity Technical & Derivative Research at Centrum Broking ITC Hotels | CMP: Rs 250.65  ITC Hotels has broken out of a symmetrical triangle pattern on the daily chart, indicating a potential trend continuation. A decisive break above Rs 255 could trigger a fresh rally towards new all-time highs. In the short term, we expect the stock to surpass resistance and move towards the Rs 270 level, supported by strong momentum post-breakout. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 270 Stop-Loss: Rs 241 Coal India | CMP: Rs 389.8  Coal India has formed a strong base and recently broke out from a falling trendline, supported by higher-than-average volumes, indicating strong buying interest. It is now trading comfortably above all key short-term and long-term moving averages, reflecting underlying strength in the trend. Furthermore, momentum indicators and oscillators on the daily chart have confirmed a bullish crossover, adding conviction to the bullish setup. Based on this technical structure, we anticipate the stock to move towards Rs 410 in the near term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 410 Stop-Loss: Rs 378 GMDC | CMP: 459.7  Gujarat Mineral Development Corporation has broken out of a symmetrical triangle pattern on the daily chart, suggesting a continuation of the uptrend. The breakout was supported by strong volume participation, indicating solid underlying strength in the stock. The pattern-based target is projected around Rs 501, with immediate support at Rs 440. Given these technical factors, the stock is likely to maintain its positive momentum in the short term, and a buy-on-dips approach is recommended. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 501 Stop-Loss: Rs 440 Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical Research and Derivatives at SBI Securities Jindal Steel and Power | CMP: Rs 1,028.35  Jindal Steel has been moving in a Rs 1,022–942 range since the start of August. The stock broke out of the range and gave a horizontal trendline breakout on Wednesday. The breakout was also supported by robust volumes. On September 1, the stock formed a piercing line candlestick pattern around its 100-day EMA and rose sharply since then. Momentum indicators are also supporting the bullish narrative. The daily RSI crossed the 60 mark, and its upward trajectory reflects improving strength in price action. On the other hand, ADX—a key trend strength indicator—shows DI+ crossing above DI-, reinforcing the bullish outlook. This confluence of price breakout, volume confirmation, and supportive trend and momentum indicators suggests that Jindal Steel is poised for further upside in the near term. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 1,025–1,035 levels. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,100 Stop-Loss: Rs 999 Pondy Oxides & Chemicals | CMP: Rs 1,165.5  Pondy Oxides marked a high of Rs 1,209 on July 31 and thereafter witnessed a throwback. During this period, volume activity was mostly below average. The stock tested its 34-day EMA multiple times, found support, and formed a strong base, suggesting accumulation at lower levels. On Wednesday, the stock gave a symmetrical triangle pattern breakout along with robust volume. It is now trading above its key moving averages, which reinforces the bullish undertone. The RSI is firmly positioned in the bullish zone, inching towards the 60 mark, reflecting improving price strength. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 1,160–1,170 levels. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,250 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,130 One 97 Communications | CMP: Rs 1,288.3  Paytm has been moving in a higher high, higher low formation on the daily chart, indicating that the stock is in a strong uptrend. It managed to hold on to its short-term key moving average—the 20-day EMA—during the recent consolidation phase and moved up steadily, reflecting strong bullish sentiment. The Paytm/Nifty ratio chart has given a major horizontal trendline breakout and is at a fresh high, indicating likely outperformance in the short term. Adding to the positive setup, the daily RSI is in bullish territory and continues to rise, reflecting strong bullish momentum. On the derivative front, all the strikes from Rs 1,200 to Rs 1,260 saw Call writers exiting (bears exiting) and strong Put writing (bulls entry), supporting the bullish outlook. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 1,285–1,295 levels. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,390 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,255 Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities Glenmark Pharma | CMP: Rs 2,004.4  Glenmark Pharmaceuticals has witnessed a smart recovery following a base formation on the daily timeframe, pointing towards a significant improvement in interest around the stock. Lately, the stock has reclaimed the 21 EMA on the daily timeframe, confirming a bullish trend. The RSI is seen to be reversing near the oversold zone.
