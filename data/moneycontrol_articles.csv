Neutral Axis Bank; target of Rs 1300: Motilal Oswal,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/neutral-axis-bank-target-of-rs-1300-motilal-oswal-2-13279356.html,"Motilal Oswal's research report on Axis Bank Axis Bank’s (AXSB) stock has significantly underperformed key private peers, led by concerns on muted growth, elevated credit cost, and a decline in RoE. The bank is strategically shifting toward secured, better yielding segments amid a cautious stance on unsecured retail and aims to outpace system growth by ~3% CAGR over the coming years. AXSB continues to focus on strengthening its liability franchise and is witnessing strong traction in the NTB (new to bank) segment. With digital initiatives, branch expansion, and a supportive LCR framework, we estimate deposits to post a 13% CAGR over FY25-27. Margins are likely to remain under pressure in the near term, driven by the transmission of repo rate cuts and slower unsecured loan growth. However, a wellmatched ALM duration will help make the impact more manageable. The bank continues to guide for through-cycle NIMs of 3.8%. Cost ratios remain higher compared to peers. While AXSB remains focused on building a stronger and more sustainable franchise—and will continue making necessary business investments—we expect positive operating jaws to emerge from FY27. Outlook While the stock trades at reasonable valuations and the risk-reward appears favorable, clarity on the trajectory of credit costs, margins, and growth remains key for a sustained performance. We estimate AXSB to deliver FY27 RoA/RoE of 1.74%/15.3%. Reiterate Neutral with a TP of INR1,300 (1.6x FY27E ABV + INR127 for subs).

Glenn Saldanha: Glenmark's R&D unit now self-sufficient for years after landmark AbbVie deal,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/glenn-saldanha-glenmark-s-r-d-unit-now-self-sufficient-for-years-after-landmark-abbvie-deal-13278839.html,"Mumbai-based drugmaker Glenmark Pharmaceuticals announced on July 10 one of the largest global licensing deals for an Indian-origin biotech asset. ISB 2001, a cancer (multiple myeloma) treatment developed by Glenmark’s US-based subsidiary Ichnos Glenmark Innovation (IGI), has been licensed to US pharma major AbbVie for $700 million (Rs 6,000 crore) upfront. IGI could earn up to $1.225 billion in additional milestone payments based on the progress of the drug through clinical trials and regulatory pathway. The company will also receive double-digit royalties on sales, once the drug is commercialised in the US, Europe, China and Japan. In an interview with Moneycontrol on July 14, Glenn Saldanha, Chairman and Managing Director of Glenmark, discussed the company's transformative deal with AbbVie, future pipeline, strategic financial deployment, and global therapeutic area leadership. Saldanha said that partnering with AbbVie has “de-risked” the company and made the R&D unit self-sufficient and self-sustaining for at least 3-4 years. The money would help IGI to develop many more assets, which can then be licensed out. Saldanha said he hasn’t yet fully figured out how to deploy much of the proceeds of the licensing deal, but added that he would be careful. “My experience tells me one wrong move can set you back 4-5 years. So, we need to be very careful,"" he said.  Glenmark has a net debt of around Rs 400 crore. Glenmark is India’s 11th largest pharma company by market capitalisation and 12th by FY25 revenue. The company has revenue of Rs. 13,322 and net profit Rs. 1,047 crore (FY25). It's latest market capitalisation is Rs 61,370.21 crore. Edited excerpts:. Q: Congratulations on the AbbVie deal. Could you clarify the deal's big payout? Given the inherent uncertainties in drug development, how optimistic are you about receiving the milestone payments? Saldanha: Thank you. The deal includes a significant $700-million upfront payment, which is already in the bank. Beyond that, there's a potential for an additional $1.2 billion in milestone payments. Well, honestly, I can't say with certainty. Drug development is inherently risky. In our 25 years, we've had many molecules, but none made it to the market, so failure is part of the game. The only guarantee we have is the $700-million upfront payment. That's for sure. Everything else depends on how clinical trials progress. We'll receive milestones as they cross certain phases. These include clinical, regulatory, and even sales-linked milestones. Then there are potentially substantial double-digit royalties, which could be truly transformational and act like an annuity for 15-20 years, making the numbers very big. Q: What does this mean for Glenmark’s financials and future direction? Saldanha: Effectively, by partnering, we've passed on the risk and de-risked ourselves. We've taken some money off the table. Crucially, we've retained the rights for emerging markets, including India. So, we've basically de-risked part of the asset by partnering with a big pharma and effectively monetising it. Q: Can you provide an update on the clinical trials of the drug (ISB 2001)? Where are they being conducted? How long will it take to cross the finish line? Saldanha: The clinical trials are already underway. We're currently in Phase 1B, conducting a dose expansion trial. The trials are primarily being conducted in the US, Australia, and Europe – those three geographies. Typically, assets at this stage, if you look at comparable ones, take about 3-5 years to get to commercialisation, even with fast-track approvals. Q: What was the reception like for the scientific presentations on this drug at conferences? Saldanha: Our first major presentation was an oral one at ASH, the American Society of Hematology, which is a big platform. Everyone really got excited by the clinical data. We followed it up with a presentation at American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in May. By that point, we already had a number of companies showing super interest in licensing this asset. The clinical response rates have been quite remarkable. For a drug at this stage, with 30-40 patients dosed, we saw a 79 percent overall response rate. This means patients who had exhausted almost all other lines of therapy, including bispecifics, chimeric antigen receptors (CAR)-T cell therapy, and antibody drug conjugates (ADCs), showed a response. And what's even more impressive is that 30 percent of them achieved complete remission, meaning they are cancer-free. Q: Can you tell us more about the BEAT platform, the core of Glenmark's multispecific antibody therapy? Saldanha: Certainly. Historically, antibodies on the market, like Darzalex or Humira, are monoclonal antibodies. They mimic the body's natural antibodies and bind to a single site. What we've done with our BEAT (Bispecific Engagement by Antibodies based on the T cell receptor) platform is to re-engineer some of these structures. We essentially changed some of the DNA sequences and protein structures in the Y-shaped antibody. So, a bispecific means you're replacing two ends of the antibody, and a trispecific means three ends. This allows it to bind to multiple sites. For example, one end can engage T-cells, and the other can engage the tumor. With trispecifics, you're adding a third variant, so, say, two will bind to the tumor and one to the T-lymphocytes to bring them to the tumour and kill it. These are all genetically engineered antibodies. The BEAT technology was developed as a 'plug-and-play' platform. We started with bispecifics and then further modified it to create tri- and multispecifics. Having multiple binding sites makes it much more powerful. In oncology, patients often progress through different therapies. For instance, in multiple myeloma, they might start with a monoclonal, then move to a bispecific, and when the tumor reinvents itself, you can introduce a trispecific. This forces the tumor to deal with three different binding sites, effectively prolonging the patient's life, as there's no ultimate cure for cancer. Q: What other assets are in Glenmark's multispecific antibody pipeline using the BEAT platform? Are they focused only on hematology? Saldanha: We've only disclosed one additional near-term asset, which is 2301. While 2001 is a T-cell engager, 2301 is an NK cell engager. It's also a multispecific antibody, and we're hoping to get that into clinics next calendar year. It's a very exciting asset. We have a couple of other early-stage multispecific antibody programmes as well, but it's too early to talk about them. And no, these are going beyond hematology; we're also targeting solid tumors. Q: How will this deal transform Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, particularly regarding its subsidiary IGI? Saldanha: This deal is transformative. IGI was heavily dependent on Glenmark for funding, burning about $70 million a year, which was a huge drag on Glenmark's P&L and balance sheet. With $700 million coming in, IGI will be self-sufficient and self-sustaining for at least the 3-4 years. Plus, some of that money will come back to the parent company for our investments in IGI, through dividends and so on. This means that within the 3-4 years, IGI will be able to develop many more assets, which can then be partnered out, leveraging the technology much more effectively. Q: How does Glenmark plan to deploy the $700-million upfront payment? Are there any M&A plans? Saldanha: M&A is not on the cards for at least the next year or two. After that, we'll evaluate. In-licensing, however, is something we continuously explore. For example, we did deals with Jiangsu Alphamab Biopharmaceuticals and 3D Medicines (Beijing) for the cancer drug, KN035 (Envafolimab). We're commercialising Envafolimab for all emerging markets. We also in-licensed Winlevi in Europe and Abrocitinib from Pfizer in India. This is part of our strategy to expand and leverage our global distribution. Regarding the capital, it will primarily sit as cash on our books, helping to de-leverage. We're taking our time to regroup and strategically figure out how to deploy this capital. My experience tells me one wrong move can set you back four or five years, so we need to be very careful. Q: What are Glenmark’s core therapeutic focus areas?Saldanha: Globally, we are focused on dermatology, and the respiratory and oncology segments. In India, we also have cardiovascular segment and are entering the diabetes segment with GLP-1s. But we don’t define ourselves by market rank. For us, it’s about dominating certain therapies globally. Q: What are the biggest challenges for Indian pharma companies in drug innovation, compared to global players, and what can be done to accelerate it? Saldanha: I've spent 25 years of my life to get to just one (ISB) 2001. Innovation is a global game, and you're competing with the biggest players in the industry – all the big pharmas with deep pockets, huge resources, and the best knowledge base. It's not an easy game to play, and India has a lot of work ahead to keep replicating these successes. Hopefully, this deal will inspire other companies to invest more in innovation. China has achieved a lot, largely due to immense government support. Here, it's largely the private sector , and it's extremely difficult to balance capital market expectations, short-term quarterly profits, and long-term investment. The de-risking mechanism is largely through licensing. There's hardly any VC money flowing into India for smaller biotechs to fund their research. Q: Are you preparing any succession plan for the company?Saldanha: I think it's still early. But I think, I mean, this is it. It's a boring business. I mean, we run a boring business. We can't generate that much news… Next gen will come at some point, right? The question is, for now, it's... I'm still young, so I think I still have some time. I'm 55 now, so I have some runway. "

Growth was impacted as OEMs delayed ramp-ups and paused R&D spends amid tariff-led challenges. Management is optimistic of a recovery from Q2 on the back of a healthy order book (OB) at end-Q1. Even with the envisaged recovery from next quarter, FY26 growth would likely be weak growth year, in our view. In contrast to management’s double-digit revenue growth aspiration, we model a 1.5% YoY USD dip in FY26. TATATECH aims to maintain its FY26 EBIT margin akin to FY25; a tall order, in our view, given the feeble revenue growth. Outlook We continue to value TATATECH at 25x on Q3FY27E to Q2FY28E EPS of INR 20 to arrive at a TP of INR 510.

The revenue guidance improvement at the lower band by 100bps eliminates the odds of hitting the worst, while improved discretionary spends on Financial Service and Technology verticals further boosts management confidence to deliver growth within the guidance band. However, the tariff sensitive verticals (Manufacturing, Retail, Healthcare) continue to see execution deferrals and slowdown in decision making, which might pose additional risk to achieve the upper end of the guidance. ER&D vertical continued to be on a weak footing, down 0.5% QoQ CC, due to weakness in Automotive and Life Science, which create additional growth headwinds. Despite the fact, the management is doubling down on AI investments and fuel S&M engines to drive differentiated offerings through agentic AI. Hence, the company is consciously taking a margin hit in the near-term, lowering margin guidance to 17-18% (18-19% earlier), to secure long-term growth. We are baking revenue growth of 3.4% and 5.8% YoY CC over FY26E & FY27E respectively, while expecting a decline in margins of 80bps YoY in FY26E followed by an improvement of 80bps in FY27E. Post the near-term correction, the stock is currently trading at 25x/22x FY26E/FY27E, hence we upgrade to HOLD (earlier REDUCE). Outlook We are baking in USD revenue/Earnings CAGR of 5.8%/7.3% between FY25-27E. The stock is currently trading at a PE of 25x/22x FY26E/FY27E earnings.

Sirca Paints: Is the market painting too rosy a picture?,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/moneycontrol-research/sirca-paints-is-the-market-painting-too-rosy-a-picture-13278851.html,"HighlightsHighly competitive intensity, weak demandStrong performance despite industry headwinds80% of manufacturing facility automated28% market share in Delhi-NCR regionStock up more than 60% since our last recommendationTrading at 32 times FY27 earningsPaint stocks are back in focus as rising competition, driven by the entry of new players, creates uncertainty for existing market leaders. While most stocks in the sector are trading sideways as investors assess the long-term impact, Sirca Paints (CMP: Rs 419; Market Cap: Rs 2,295 crore; Rating: Overweight), a leading player in the paints and wood coatings space, has emerged as a notable out-performer. The company posted an impressive 22 percent year-on-year (YoY) revenue growth in Q4FY25, marking a strong recovery, after several quarters of muted performance and margin pressure. This turnaround has propelled the stock over 61 percent since our March 2025 recommendation to accumulate. But with competitive intensity rising and margin headwinds still a concern, the key question is: is the rally sustainable? Portfolio expansion, strategic partnership Sirca continues to diversify its product portfolio across the entry-level, economy, and luxury segments. Its partnership with Italy’s OIKOS S.P.A. has been a key growth driver, bringing in high-value, eco-friendly products with A+ air quality standards. While the high-margin decorative and luxury segments—especially OIKOS offerings—are gaining traction, the economy decorative segment is witnessing increased competition. In FY25, decorative paints, including OIKOS, contributed 7 percent to the company’s revenue. To strengthen brand visibility and customer engagement, Sirca is investing 4–5 percent of its revenue in marketing and promotions. The company is also preparing to launch ultra-premium wall paints in collaboration with OIKOS, targeting the luxury home décor segment. Additionally, Sirca is expanding its presence in emerging markets like Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, the North-East, and South India, supporting its pan-India growth ambition. Dealer expansion on track Sirca generates nearly 70 percent of its revenue from northern India. To build a stronger pan-India presence and reduce regional dependency, the company is actively expanding its dealer network across other parts of the country. As of FY25, Sirca’s dealer and distributor network has grown to over 4,000, which also includes the dealer network of its recently acquired Welcome brand. This expansion is aimed at driving growth and strengthening its position in new and under-penetrated markets. Expands capacity, eyes global export growth Sirca has expanded its Sonipat manufacturing unit’s capacity from 12,000 tonnes to 16,000 tonnes. The current capacity utilisation stands at 55-60 percent, and it is expected to reach 70-75 percent over the next 1-2 years, with a single-shift operation. Exports present a significant opportunity for Sirca, with the company targeting 20 million euros in exports to Russia, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Estonia for economical PU products, pending final approval from Sirca Italy for product quality checks. The current facility is well-equipped to handle export demand. Sirca plans to set up a manufacturing facility in Dahej with an estimated investment of Rs 20–25 crore, which will add an additional capacity of 16,000 tonnes. The company is also exploring inorganic growth opportunities, including potential expansion into the metal coatings segment. To support its upcoming capital expenditure plans, Sirca is raising Rs 76 crore through a preferential issue. Welcome brand to drive growth The acquisition of the Welcome brand is progressing well and is strengthening Sirca’s presence in the value segment. The addition of products like sanding sealers, lacquers, enamels, and melamine expands its portfolio to tap industrial demand. Despite weak consumer sentiment, Sirca has generated Rs 35 crore in revenue from the Welcome brand in 9MFY25. Outlook & valuations Sirca Paints has continued to show strong revenue growth, but margins have come under pressure in recent quarters due to higher dealer incentives. Going forward, we expect margins to stabilise with a better product mix and increasing contribution from the Welcome brand. The stock has seen a strong rally in the past four months and is now close to its all-time high of Rs 430. Despite rising competition, we believe Sirca can still grow at 15–20 percent annually. While the recent rally may be factoring in short-term optimism, the long-term growth story remains strong. At 32x FY27 estimated earnings, we remain positive on the company’s future. "

"Tejas Networks shares slip 11% as Q1 loss, revenue slump spook investors",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/tejas-networks-shares-slip-11-as-q1-loss-revenue-slump-spook-investors-13278954.html,"Shares of Tejas Networks dropped as much as 11 percent to Rs 627 on July 15 before trimming losses to trade over 5 percent lower, after the company reported a sharp loss for the June quarter. The sell-off was triggered by weak earnings, with the company slipping to a consolidated net loss of Rs 193.9 crore in Q1 FY26, compared to a net profit of Rs 77.5 crore in the same period last year. The disappointing performance, driven by a steep decline in revenue and operational metrics, weighed on investor sentiment. Revenue plunged 87 percent year-on-year to Rs 211 crore, down from Rs 1,563 crore in Q1 FY25, largely due to delayed purchase orders and shipment clearances, especially related to the BSNL 4G rollout. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates On a sequential basis, revenue was down 89 percent. The company also reported an EBITDA loss of Rs 126.6 crore, with margins crashing to -60 percent from 10.9 percent a year earlier. “The revenue shortfall was primarily due to delays in order receipts, including from BSNL,” said COO Arnob Roy, adding that Tejas secured orders for routers under BharatNet Phase 3 and optical equipment from private operators in India.

CFO Sumit Dhingra said the bottom line was impacted by lower topline performance but noted that the order book stood at Rs 1,241 crore—up 22 percent quarter-on-quarter. He added that a Rs 1,526 crore RAN equipment order linked to BSNL’s expansion is expected soon. At about 9:45 am, shares of the company were trading at Rs 660, lower by 5.5 percent from the last close on the NSE.

However, any bounce back today may be more of a breather than a trend reversal, with trade tariff worries still weighing on sentiment. At about 9:25 am, the Sensex was up 150.45 points or 0.18 percent at 82,403.91, and the Nifty was up 53.70 points or 0.21 percent at 25,136.00.

We believe the tariffs are a negotiating tactic and expect a de-escalation before the August 1 deadline, helping limit downside in equities,"" Devarsh Vakil, Head of Prime Research at HDFC Securities, said. Experts also say that FIIs, which have been net buyers in April, May and June, have turned net sellers in July as per the latest data. This has put pressure on large caps. Absence of institutional selling in the broader market is keeping this segment resilient despite the elevated valuations. At the open on Tuesday, sectoral indices on the NSE were trading largely in the green, indicating a positive start to the day. Nifty Auto gained 0.73 percent, while Nifty Oil & Gas rose 0.77 percent. Broader indices also saw traction, with the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 advancing 0.61 percent and 0.87 percent, respectively. Other notable gainers included Nifty Consumer Durables (0.61 percent), Energy (0.58 percent), Pharma (0.58 percent), and Infra (0.41 percent). Banking indices posted modest gains, while FMCG and Realty were flat. Meanwhile, India VIX edged lower by 0.5 percent to 11.92, suggesting continued investor calm. Among individual stocks, HCL Tech shares slipped 3 percent after the information technology giant reported disappointing earnings for the first quarter of the current fiscal year. The IT major reported a 10 percent decline in consolidated net profit at Rs 3,843 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, as against Rs 4,257 crore in the year-ago period.

The earlier support zone of 25,200–25,300 has now reversed into a resistance zone. A decisive break below today’s low of 25,001 could further deteriorate the technical setup. On the flip side, only a sustained move above 25,350 could signal the potential for recovery, marking this level as a key hurdle. The momentum indicator RSI has slipped below 50, for the first time in over three months, underscoring weakening bullish strength. Hero MotoCorp, IndusInd Bank, Grasim, Shriram Finance, and Bajaj Auto were the top gainers on the Nifty. Laggards on the index included HCL Tech, Cipla, Tata Steel, SBI Life Insurance, and ICICI Bank.

Sell Tata Technologies; target of Rs 570: Prabhudas Lilladher,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/sell-tata-technologies-target-of-rs-570-prabhudas-lilladher-13278779.html,"Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Tata Technologies The Services revenue de-growth (7.6% CC QoQ) was below our estimates (5.1% CC QoQ), largely due to delayed ramp ups and slower decision making within automotive vertical. Although the aerospace momentum continued through Q1, the weakness in the Heavy-Machinery segment led the decline (4.7% QoQ) in non-Auto business. The management anticipates recovery in Q2 on the back of strategic deals signings, while early green shoots are visible in term of improved client sentiment and robust order book, hinting to a better H2 over H1. We believe, with improved client confidence, the earlier investments that were kept on hold would get prioritized first, while the new projects would continue to be pushed for further clarity on the trade war. Given the Q1 drag and volatility in the non-Auto business, the ask-rate for the Service business seems to be meaningfully high (~5% CQGR) to deliver flat growth in FY26. The reported margins were tad below our estimates by 30bps QoQ due to lower employee utilization and operating de-leverage. We are keeping our margin estimates broadly unchanged, while baking in revenue decline of 3.0% and 1.2% for Service/Consol business in FY26E followed by 11.5% growth in FY27E for both Service/Consol. Outlook We are assigning 28x PE to FY27E, translating a TP of 570 and maintain our SELL rating.

"Tata Technologies shares rise as net profit up 5%; should you buy, sell, or hold?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/tata-technologies-shares-rise-as-net-profit-up-5-should-you-buy-sell-or-hold-13278656.html,"Tata Group's Tata Technologies shares were in the green on Tuesday, July 15, after the firm posted its earnings show for the quarter ended June 30, 2025. Tata Technologies reported a net profit of Rs 170.28 crore for Q1 FY26, reflecting a year-on-year increase of nearly 5 percent from Rs 162 crore in the same quarter last year. However, on a sequential basis, net profit declined by around 10 percent from Rs 189 crore in Q4 FY25. Revenue from operations fell 2 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,244 crore, compared to Rs 1,269 crore in Q1 FY25. Sequentially, revenue dipped over 3 percent from Rs 1,286 crore reported in the previous quarter. Operating EBITDA for the quarter stood at over Rs 200 crore, with an EBITDA margin of 16.1 percent. The company’s workforce grew to 12,505 employees, while the voluntary attrition rate (LTM) was reported at 13.7 percent. In constant currency terms, revenue dropped by over 5 percent year-on-year to $145.3 million in Q1 FY26 from $152.1 million a year ago. At 9.17 am, shares of the firm were quoting Rs 726, higher by 1.3 percent on the NSE. Should you buy, sell, or hold shares of Tata Technologies? Goldman Sachs has maintained a 'sell' rating on Tata Technologies with a target price of Rs 560 per share. The brokerage noted that Q1 results were broadly in line with estimates, although revenue declined 4.6 percent quarter-on-quarter in constant currency terms. EBITDA margin missed expectations by 80 basis points, attributed to weaker performance in core services and negative operating leverage. However, the management expects a sequential revenue recovery in Q2, driven by improved customer engagement and deal wins in June. Importantly, the company’s guidance for Q2 growth is not contingent on any resolution of tariff-related issues. International brokerage JP Morgan also kept its 'underweight' rating intact, cutting its target price to Rs 570 per share, following the first quarter earnings show.

"HCL Technologies shares fall 4% on weaker-than-expected Q1 show; should you buy, sell, or hold?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/hcl-technologies-shares-in-focus-on-weaker-than-expected-q1-show-should-you-buy-sell-or-hold-13278312.html,"IT services player HCL Technologies Ltd shares slipped on Tuesday, July 15, after the information technology giant reported a disappointing earnings show for the first quarter of the current fiscal year. HCLTech reported a 10 percent decline in consolidated net profit at Rs 3,843 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, as against Rs 4,257 crore in the year-ago period. However, the IT firm's consolidated revenue from operations rose eight percent to Rs 30,349 crore in Q1FY26 as against Rs 28,057 crore in Q1FY25. HCLTech’s operating margin dropped to 16.3 percent in Q1, falling 160 basis points from 17.9 percent in Q4FY25. However, it has lowered its operating margin guidance for the full year to 17-18 percent, down from the previous estimate of 18-19 percent. The company has updated its FY26 constant currency revenue growth forecast to 3-5 percent, raising the upper end from the earlier 2-5 percent range. At 10.20 a.m., shares of HCL Technologies were quoting Rs 1,555.4, lower by 4 percent on the NSE. Should you buy, sell, or hold shares of HCL Technologies? HCL Technologies narrowed the revenue growth guidance on expectations of faster deal ramp-ups, but lowered the margin guidance, reflecting a temporary dip with normalisation expected by Q4FY26E, noted Nuvama Institutional Equities. The brokerage downgraded shares of the IT firm to 'hold' and cut its target price to Rs 1,630, which was earlier Rs 1,700, given valuation concerns. Emkay Global also trimmed its target price, cutting it to Rs 1,660, while retaining its 'reduce' outlook. The brokerage noted the earnings were weaker-than-expected, as a result of the margin miss. ""EBIT margin fell by 170 bps QoQ to 16.3 percent, missing our estimate due to lower utilization, higher investments in S&M and Gen AI, business mix change, and a one-off impact."" Citi Research maintained its 'neutral' call, with a price target of Rs 1,650 per share amid a mixed Q1. No demand deterioration was seen, while the BFSI and Tech verticals were improving, and others were weak. On the optimistic front, CLSA kept its 'outperform' call intact, with a price target of Rs 1,867 on HCLTech shares. The brokerage is optimistic that EBIT margins will revert to 18-19 percent from FY27. International brokerage Jefferies upgraded its outlook on HCL Technologies to 'buy', with a higher price target of Rs 1,850 per share. The increase in FY26 growth guidance was among the highest across the top five IT firms in India, driving Jefferies' bullishness. Further, going ahead, investments will drive superior growth and premium valuation.

"Sensex, Nifty eye mild gains at open; key levels to watch on July 15",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sensex-nifty-eye-mild-gains-at-open-key-levels-to-watch-on-july-15-13278223.html,"Benchmark indices Nifty and Sensex are set for a muted yet positive start on July 15, offering a glimmer of relief after four straight sessions of losses. Any bounce back today may be more of a breather than a trend reversal, with trade tariff worries still weighing on sentiment. In the previous session, equity indices closed the session mildly in the red after IT stocks tumbled amid weak Q1 earnings. The broader market outperformed the frontline indices with gains of a percent, each. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates On July 14, Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) were net sellers to the tune of Rs 1,614 crore worth of shares, while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) net bought Rs 1,787 crore worth. Here are the important levels to watch out for in today's session Structurally, market breadth remains feeble, with bulls failing to show commitment. The earlier support zone of 25,200–25,300 has now reversed into a resistance zone. A decisive break below today’s low of 25,001 could further deteriorate the technical setup. On the flip side, only a sustained move above 25,350 could signal the potential for recovery, marking this level as a key hurdle. The momentum indicator RSI has slipped below 50, for the first time in over three months, underscoring weakening bullish strength. Adding to the cautious tone, Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) have consistently accumulated short positions in index futures, reflecting ongoing institutional scepticism. ""For a meaningful trend reversal to unfold, a decisive close above the 57,300–57,370 resistance band for the Bank Nifty is essential. Until such confirmation emerges, upward moves may remain capped. The index now hovers near a key support zone at 56,600. A breakdown below this area could further weaken the technical structure and expose the index to a downside target of 56,000. Conversely, a breakout above the 57,300–57,350 resistance band would be required to invalidate the current weakness and reignite bullish interest,"" Dhupesh Dhameja of SAMCO Securities said. Despite the index’s downward move, India VIX rose marginally by 1.38 percent to 11.98 but remains well below the psychological threshold of 15. This muted rise in volatility suggests that while selling persists, there is no sign of panic-driven exits. The current low-volatility regime indicates a lack of directional conviction, favouring a measured decline rather than sharp corrections. The Put-Call Ratio (PCR) remains unchanged at 0.54, underscoring heightened call writing activity. This low PCR suggests a continued bearish undertone, and any additional selling may push the PCR into the oversold territory.

Luxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/luxury-development-boom-stokes-jump-in-indian-real-estate-shares-13278205.html,"A rally in India’s real estate stocks is gaining momentum, driven by optimism that robust residential pre-sales and a boom in luxury housing projects will bolster investor confidence. A gauge of local property shares have surged more than 25% from an April low, putting the sector on track to outperform the benchmark Nifty 50 Index for a fifth straight month in July. The rebound follows a sharp selloff earlier this year amid concerns about a slowing economy. Investors are betting on a turnaround in India’s property market with developers set to report a record 447 billion rupees ($5.2 billion) in pre-sales in the first quarter, according to a July 7 report from Kotak Institutional Equities. Upcoming new launches from DLF Ltd., Prestige Estates Projects Ltd. and Lodha Developers Ltd. are adding to stronger sentiment. “We believe tier-1 developers with strong balance sheets and diversified portfolios should continue to benefit from the structural long cycle positive demand trends in India,” Harsh Wardhan Modi, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co., wrote on Friday. DLF said it sold 110 billion rupees worth of luxury homes within a week of launch in June, while Prestige notched an all-time high sales bookings in the quarter. While shares of the two are down year to date, they’re more than 35% higher since bottoming out in April. “Many developers in our coverage have less than one year of unsold inventory and strong balance sheets, giving them pricing and staying power,” HSBC Holdings analysts including Puneet Gulati wrote in a recent note. Still, concerns over aggressive new project launches and the risk of oversupply are weighing on future growth. Questions about whether the property cycle has peaked and if the pace of sales will continue has prompted some investors to take pause. For now, they’re turning their attention to upcoming earnings season scheduled to kick off later this month. Key areas to watch include whether firms revise guidance upward for fiscal 2026 pre-sales and cash collection, according to Citigroup Inc. analysts."

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Voltas, Sonata Software, Piramal Enterprises, Tata Motors, Redington, Coromandel, Eternal and others on July 15?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-voltas-sonata-software-piramal-enterprises-tata-motors-redington-coromandel-eternal-and-others-on-july-15-13277557.html,"Indian equity benchmarks fell a third of a percent on July 14, continuing their downtrend for the fourth straight session, with subdued market breadth. A total of 1,406 shares declined compared to 1,269 that gained on the NSE. The market may see further consolidation with a negative bias if it breaks Monday’s low in the upcoming sessions. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Jigar S Patel, Senio Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi NTPC | CMP: Rs 342.1  NTPC has been forming a strong base in the Rs 330–340 zone over the past two months, establishing an inside value relationship on the monthly Camarilla pivot—a structure that typically precedes a directional breakout. This consolidation indicates reduced volatility and energy build-up, which often leads to an explosive move. Additionally, the RSI remains comfortably above the 50 mark, suggesting that underlying bullish momentum is intact. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 343–340 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 375 Stop-Loss: Rs 325 Voltas | CMP: Rs 1,376.8  Voltas has established a strong base in the Rs 1,330–1,340 zone over the past month. This price action has led to the formation of an overlapping higher value relationship on the monthly Camarilla pivot, which typically signals accumulation and a potential upside breakout in the coming weeks. The RSI is comfortably positioned above 60, indicating strengthening bullish momentum and favourable conditions for a continued upward move. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 1,380–1,360 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,500 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,300 Sonata Software | CMP: Rs 432.9  Sonata Software formed back-to-back inside value relationships on the monthly Camarilla pivots, signaling consolidation and strong buildup. A breakout on July 8 confirmed the end of this phase. Since then, the stock has entered a healthy pullback, finding strong support above Rs 420—a key technical level. Holding above this mark suggests buyer strength, and if sustained, Sonata Software may resume its upward trajectory in the coming sessions with potential for further gains. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 435–425 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 500 Stop-Loss: Rs 400 Jay Thakkar, Vice President & Head of Derivatives and Quant Research at ICICI Securities Piramal Pharma | CMP: 207.88  Piramal Pharma has provided a breakout from a falling trendline, accompanied by an increase in open interest in the futures segment—indicating long buildup, which is a positive sign in the near term. The stock has witnessed Call unwinding as well as Put additions at lower levels from Rs 205 to Rs 190 strikes, indicating support at the lower levels. Overall, the Nifty Pharma Index has been inching higher, so the sector outlook is also positive along with the stock. Buy Piramal Pharma Futures in the range of Rs 205–210. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 225, Rs 235 Stop-Loss: Rs 195 Piramal Enterprises | CMP: Rs 1,293.3  Piramal Enterprises has provided a huge breakout from sideways consolidation, along with long buildup in the futures segment. The stock is trading well above its 20-day VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) as well as its maximum pain and modified maximum pain levels, indicating a strong uptrend in the near term. The stock has witnessed heavy Put writing and Call unwinding, with the Rs 1,300 strike now holding the highest Call open interest. Above this level, the up move is likely to extend. Buy Piramal Enterprises Futures in the range of Rs 1,285–1,300. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,400, Rs 1,450 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,225 Tata Motors | CMP: Rs 674.5  Tata Motors has broken its uptrend line, and with that, open interest in futures has begun to rise, indicating that short covering is over and new shorts are being built, pointing to a downtrend in the near term. The stock has seen heavy Call writing and Put unwinding, clearly suggesting that bears have the upper hand for now. Tata Motors is also trading well below its maximum pain levels, hence the Rs 700 level will act as a critical resistance going forward. Sell Tata Motors Futures in the range of Rs 680–675. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 645, Rs 635 Stop-Loss: Rs 692 Vidnyan S Sawant, Head of Research at GEPL Capital Redington | CMP: Rs 307.95  Redington has been demonstrating strong relative strength and is currently showing a bullish polarity shift, with the May 2025 swing high now acting as support. This support also aligns with a bullish mean reversion from the 26-day EMA, indicating a positive shift in sentiment.

Glenmark to focus on innovation and therapeutic specialisation,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/glenmark-to-focus-on-innovation-and-therapeutic-specialisation-13277664.html,"Glenmark Pharmaceuticals is entering a new phase of strategic transformation, fuelled by a $700 million upfront payment from AbbVie for its multi-specific antibody asset ISB 2001. Chairman and managing director Glenn Saldanha said the company is now focused on innovation, therapeutic specialization, and disciplined capital deployment. “We are just trying to regroup… one wrong move takes you back by four or five years,” Glenn Saldanha said, emphasizing caution in deploying the AbbVie funds., in an interview to Moneycontrol. The company has ruled out mergers and acquisitions in the near term, opting instead to strengthen its core innovation engine and expand its licensing portfolio. “M&A is not on the cards. At least for the next year, year, two years, we won’t do anything in the M&A space,” Saldanha confirmed. Glenmark’s strategic focus will be centered on three therapeutic areas such as respiratory, oncology, and dermatology. These segments are expected to drive branded and innovative product growth globally. “We are already about 60% branded today… that number will keep escalating,” he said. “We are more interested in globally dominating certain therapies.” De-risking R&D Glenmark's high-risk, high-cash-burn R&D model has been a cause of concern for Indian investors, as they prefer safer bets with better return ratios. The AbbVie deal relieves Glenmark of the financial burden of funding its US-based subsidiary, Ichnos Glenmark Innovation (IGI), and may give the drugmaker some breathing room and flexibility. “IGI was heavily dependent on Glenmark for funding… they burn about $70 million a year,” Saldanha said. “Now, with $700 million coming in, they are self-sufficient plus self-sustaining.” “We’ve effectively de-risked part of the asset by getting a big pharma and monetising it,” Saldanha said. “We keep in-licensing products and expanding, leveraging our distribution globally,” he added. Saldanha said the company will be pursuing branded and innovation driven model, as it moves up the value chain from generics. “We are already about 60% branded today… that number will keep escalating,” Saldanha said."

Glenmark to double down on innovation with multispecific antibody pipeline against cancers,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/glenmark-to-double-down-on-innovation-with-multispecific-antibody-pipeline-against-cancers-13277627.html,"Glenmark Pharmaceuticals is doubling down on its innovation-led strategy, with a growing pipeline of multispecific antibody therapies that could reshape its future. Chairman and Managing Director Glenn Saldanha said on Monday to Moneycontrol that the company has several assets under development, including two disclosed candidates—ISB 2001 and ISB 2301—both emerging from its proprietary BEAT platform. The $700 million upfront payment from AbbVie, announced on July 10, has provided Glenmark with breathing room and strategic flexibility. “IGI (Glenmark’s US subsidiary) was heavily dependent on Glenmark for funding… we funded IGI to a substantial extent since 2019 and they burn about $70 million a year. That has been a huge drag on Glenmark’s P&L and Balance Sheet,” Saldanha said. “Now, with $700 million coming in, at least for the next three, four years, they are self-sufficient plus self-sustaining… plus some amount will go back to the parent for all the investments we've made into IGI.” ISB 2001 was licensed last week to AbbVie in a landmark deal, where Glenmark's US-based subsidiary Ichnos Glenmark Innovation (IGI), will receive $700 million upfront cash and could earn up to $1.225 billion in additional milestone payments, along with double-digit royalties on sales if the drug is commercialised. The potential drug is currently in Phase 1B trials across the US, Australia, and Europe. The drug has shown promising early results, with a 79% overall response rate and 30% complete remission when administered to late-stage cancer patients. ""They (patients in clinical trials) came onto this drug after having gone through everything else”. Saldanha added. “We’ve only disclosed one asset, 2301, which is an NK cell engager and multispecific antibody,” Saldanha said. Saldanha stated that ISB 2301 is for treating solid tumours and is expected to enter clinical trials in the next calendar year. “2301 is the near-term asset, which we've now publicly disclosed that we are hoping to get that into the clinics next calendar year.” Saldanha said the company has a couple of multispecific antibody early-stage programs, declining to reveal more details. Additionally, Ichnos has entered into a $320 million licensing deal for its OX40 program to Astria Therapeutics, which includes a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody GBR 830 targeting OX40 receptor on T-cells and ISB 880 targeting autoimmune diseases to Almirall. Both the deals include upfront fees, development, regulatory, and sales milestones, plus low double-digit royalties. GBR 830 is currently in clinical trials for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in the US and Europe. These deals reflect the company’s strategy to monetize innovation while managing risk. IGI's multi-specific antibodies are developed using its proprietary BEAT platform. Multi-specific antibody drug binds multiple targets on cancer cells, along with priming immune cells like T cells and NK cells to recognize and destroy the cancer cells. “BEAT was developed as a plug-and-play technology… you just plug anything on that platform and test it,” he explained. “Multi means four, five, six binding sites… it makes it super powerful (drug against cancer).” Bispecific and multispecific antibody therapies help in extending the lives of patients whose cancer has relapsed and who have exhausted all other treatment opti"

"Sun Pharma settles patent litigation with Incyte, paving way for launch of anti-baldness drug LEQSELVI",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/sun-pharma-settles-patent-litigation-with-incyte-paving-way-for-launch-of-anti-baldness-drug-leqselvi-13277042.html,"India's largest pharmaceutical company, Sun Pharma announced on July 14 that it has settled a patent litigation with US biopharma MNC Incyte Corporation for an upfront payment over and above an ongoing royalty, paving the way for an immediate US launch of LEQSELVI (deuruxolitinib), used to treat severe alopecia areata, an autoimmune disease that leads to hair loss or baldness. The agreement stipulates that both parties will seek dismissal of the pending LEQSELVI litigation in the US District Court for the District of New Jersey, and will mutually release all claims that were or could have been raised in the litigation. As part of the agreement, Incyte has granted Sun Pharma a 'limited, non-exclusive license' to US Patent Nos. 9,662,335 and other related patents. This license pertains to oral deuruxolitinib for certain agreed-upon non-hematology-oncology indications, including alopecia areata, the statement said. In exchange for the settlement and license, Sun Pharma will make an upfront payment to Incyte, in addition to ongoing royalty payments until the expiry of the patents. The specific financial terms of the settlement and license agreement remain confidential. The launch of LEQSELVI has been delayed by a year due to patent litigation between Sun Pharma and Incyte. The American biopharma company had secured injunction against the proposed launch of the drug in July, claiming that Sun’s pre-launch activities have violated Incyte’s rightful intellectual property in the valid and enforceable ’335 Patent. Sun Pharma had paid $576 million (Rs 4,600 crore) upfront, added with conditional sales-based milestone payments for the acquisition LEQSELVI from US-based Concert Pharma. Richard Ascroft, CEO of Sun Pharma North America, stated that the launch provides an ""effective, new treatment option"" for eligible patients and healthcare providers, highlighting LEQSELVI as a 'key milestone' for the company's dermatology portfolio and an 'important advancement' for the alopecia areata community. Sun Pharma said LEQSELVI demonstrated rapid results in clinical trials, with one-third of patients regaining almost all of their hair by week 24. Some patients achieved 80% or more scalp coverage as early as 8 weeks. Alopecia areata can have significant psychosocial impact, leading to psychological distress and loss of self-confidence due to unpredictable hair loss. Nicole Friedland, President and CEO of the National Alopecia Areata Foundation (NAAF), expressed optimism, stating that LEQSELVI offers ""hope"" and expands choices for individuals seeking an FDA-approved treatment for this autoimmune disease."

On a daily chart, the Index has formed a bearish candle, but a potential hidden bullish divergence in the RSI, coupled with 50DMA support, provides hint of a trend reversal. The zone of 24,970-25,000 will serve as a strong support area, whereas upside seems to be restricted at 25,325. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The Nifty continues to decline as tariff tensions weigh on market sentiment. Additionally, participants are awaiting CPI data from both India and the US, which is further dampening overall sentiment. Technically, the index slipped towards 25,000 on an intraday basis, which is very close to the 50-DMA. On the lower end, support is placed at 24,900–24,950. If this zone holds, a rally towards 25,350 looks possible. However, failure to sustain above 24,900 may trigger a deeper phase of correction.

Shares of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) fell 1.61 percent to settle at Rs 428.9 apiece on the NSE, while Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) slipped 0.25 percent to Rs 344. Rising global oil prices are seen hurting gross marketing margins of oil marketing companies that buy crude and sell refined fuels. Meanwhile, upstream oil firms gained. Shares of Oil India rose nearly 3.17 percent to Rs 446, while Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd (ONGC) added 1 percent to end at Rs 244.15. Higher crude prices tend to benefit upstream producers by improving realisations and margins. Crude oil prices climbed as markets awaited a 'major announcement' from US President Donald Trump related to Russia. Trump had recently voiced support for a Bill proposing 500 percent tariffs on crude imports from Russia. Additional sanctions by the US and a fresh European Union package targeting Russian oil exports are seen as potential supply risks. Among paint companies, Asian Paints shares declined 1.41 percent to Rs 2,404.80. Berger Paints India and Kansai Nerolac Paints dropped 2.72 percent and 0.10 percent, respectively. The decorative paint industry is raw material-intensive, with crude oil derivatives forming a major input component. Raw material costs account for 55–60 percent of overall expenses, impacting gross margins when crude prices rise. Tyre manufacturers also felt the pressure. Apollo Tyres closed 1.02 percent lower at Rs 453.90. Shares of CEAT and JK Tyre also ended in the red. Brent crude is a key input in synthetic rubber and petrochemical-based products used in tyre manufacturing. Higher crude oil prices tend to increase India’s import bill and stoke inflation, affecting broader market sentiment.

"HDFC Life Q1 Preview: Double-digit APE growth likely, margins to expand as product mix shifts",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/hdfc-life-q1-preview-double-digit-ape-growth-likely-margins-to-expand-amid-product-mix-rebalancing-13275605.html,"Private life insurer HDFC Life is expected to deliver double-digit growth in its annual premium equivalent (APE) for the April–June quarter (Q1FY26), fueled by new premium policies. The value of new business (VNB) is also projected to post a double-digit YoY increase, according to analysts. The company is scheduled to announce its quarterly results on July 15, 2025. According to a poll of five brokerages conducted by Moneycontrol, HDFC Life’s APE is expected to rise to Rs 3,273 crore in Q1FY26, compared to Rs 2,866 crore in Q1FY25. APE is a key measure that captures the total value of new business by combining the annual premiums of regular policies with one-tenth of single premiums.  Meanwhile, VNB is likely to grow to Rs 834 crore in Q1FY26 from Rs 720 crore in the same quarter last year. VNB reflects the profitability of new policies sold during a specific period. Estimates of analysts polled by Moneycontrol are shown to be in a narrow range, meaning any positive or negative surprises may elicit a sharp reaction in the stock price. Among the brokerages polled, Motilal Oswal rolled out the most bullish projections while Centrum forecasted the slowest growth for HDFC Life. What factors are driving the earnings? Gross premium income: According to Motilal Oswal, gross business premium is expected to sustain its growth trajectory. First-year premiums are projected to grow by about 12.5 percent YoY in Q1FY26, while renewal premiums may rise by approximately 17 percent and single premiums by as much as 29 percent YoY. Margin expansion: Brokerages anticipate that HDFC Life’s VNB margins will expand by 90 basis points year-on-year to around 26 percent in Q1FY26, compared to 25.1 percent in Q1FY25. This improvement is attributed to a higher proportion of non-participating (non-par) and protection products, as well as the base effect of high unit-linked insurance plan (ULIP) sales in the prior period. Reduced regulatory noise: Analysts at Emkay noted that the fading regulatory overhang — pertaining to the Union Budget, Income Tax Bill, and bancassurance norms — has led to a material re-rating of insurance stocks in recent months. With growth slowdown now largely priced in, potential positive regulatory developments and a possible recovery in growth could continue to support the stock’s performance. What to look out for in the quarterly show? Investors will closely monitor the product mix, as well as management commentary regarding the outlook for non-par and protection products. During the April–June period, HDFC Life’s stock price climbed around 19 percent, outperforming the Nifty 50 index, which gained about 8 percent in the same period.

Buy Avenue Supermarts; target of Rs 4500: Motilal Oswal,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-avenue-supermarts-target-of-rs-4500-motilal-oswal-2-13275292.html,"Motilal Oswal's research report on Avenue Supermarts Avenue Supermarts (DMART) posted another weak set in 1QFY26 as standalone EBITDA grew 8% YoY (5% miss) due to weaker gross margin (GM; -25bp YoY) and higher cost of retailing (CoR; up 9% YoY on a per sqft basis). Standalone revenue grew ~16% YoY, driven by ~14% store area addition. Like-for-like (LFL) growth for over two-year-old stores moderated to 7.1% (vs. 8.1%/9.1% in 4QFY25/1QFY25) due to deflation. DMART added 9 stores in 1QFY26 (vs. 6 in 1QFY25). Acceleration in the pace of store additions continues to be the primary growth driver for DMART. GM contracted ~27bp YoY to 14.6% (~25bp miss) due to ~15bp YoY decline in the share of the higher-margin GM&A category and continued heightened competition in the FMCG category.

"Defence stocks extend losses to third day on profit-booking; GRSE, Cochin Shipyard, BDL fall up to 4%",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/defence-stocks-extend-losses-to-third-day-on-profit-booking-grse-cochin-shipyard-bdl-fall-up-to-4-13275525.html,"The shares of defence companies dropped in trade on July 14 as investors continued to book profits at elevated levels. The sharp fall in the share prices pushed the Nifty India Defence index down over 0.6 percent to hover around 8,457.70 in the afternoon, extending losses for the third consecutive session. The defence stocks saw significant rally earlier this year, but analysts now flag high valuations. The shares of the companies came in focus on hopes of higher order inflows, after the Indian military conducted targeted strikes against terrorist outfits in Pakistan under the codename 'Operation Sindoor' in May. As the geopolitical tensions between India and Pakistan eased, the escalations in Russia-Ukraine war continued to support the rally in defence stocks. The rise in tensions between Israel and Iran further boosted the stocks. However, as geopolitical tensions around the globe continue to ease, the defence stocks declined. Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers (GRSE) shares were the top loser on the index, dropping nearly 4 percent to trade at Rs 2,698 apiece. Fresh shareholding data released by the company points to a shift in investor sentiment during the April-June quarter. Retail participation saw a noticeable dip, with the number of small shareholders — those holding shares with up to Rs 2 lakh in value — declining to 3.97 lakh from 4.04 lakh in the March quarter. In percentage terms, retail investor ownership fell to 14.89 percent from 16.72 percent previously. Domestic mutual funds also trimmed their exposure slightly. Their collective holding dropped to 1.4 percent in June, down from 1.64 percent in March. Notably, HDFC Mutual Fund, which featured among shareholders in the March quarter, no longer appears in the list — indicating that its stake has slipped below the 1 percent threshold. GRSE shares have now fallen over 12 percent in the past one month, after rallying nearly 88 percent in the past six months. Cochin Shipyard shares followed, dropping nearly 3 percent. Zen Technologies shares declined over 2 percent, while Paras Defence and Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders shares were down nearly 2 percent each. Additionally, Brazil has reportedly halted negotiations with India to acquire the Akash missile system. According to a report by CNN Brazil, the country is now negotiating a $920 million deal with European defence company MBDA for its Enhanced Modular Air Defence Solutions (EMADS). Akash missiles are manufactured by Bharat Dynamics (BDL), with key component and systems being developed by Bharat Electronics (BEL). BDL shares fell over 1 percent, while BEL shares were trading in the red with marginal losses. Bucking the trend, BEML and Astra Microwave shares gained over 1 percent, while Data Patters and Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) shares were trading in the green with marginal gains. Also read: Our LIVE blog on stock market updates ""The recent weakness in defence stocks is neither surprising nor alarming. Historically, the sector has witnessed sharp 15–20% corrections following steep multi-month rallies—a pattern that has repeated across multiple market cycles. What’s unfolding now is likely a healthy mean reversion, not a breakdown in fundamentals,"" said Harshal Dasani Business Head, INVasset PMS. ""Over the past year, India’s defence sector has been propelled by strong structural tailwinds: indigenisation, rising exports, NATO-linked demand spillovers, and a record-high order pipeline estimated at Rs 16 lakh crore. FY24 alone saw defence exports hit a record ₹21,000 crore, rising nearly 32% year-on-year, while ‘Make in India’ initiatives helped lift the self-reliance ratio to around 65%. Such a backdrop supports sustained institutional interest. But markets move in waves—profit-booking after 60–80% rallies over three to six months is a natural phenomenon. In our view, this pullback offers an opportunity for disciplined investors, especially as Q2 and Q3 may bring execution progress on delayed defence orders and fresh export contracts,"" he added. Dasani however noted that the structural thesis remains intact — India is transitioning from a net importer to a credible global supplier in the defence ecosystem. ""Temporary corrections should be seen in this broader context, not mistaken for trend reversals,"" he said. Defence stocks are currently seeing some profit-taking after a sharp rally driven by rising geopolitical tensions and India’s thrust on domestic defence manufacturing, said Ajit Mishra, SVP of Research at Religare Broking. ""While near-term volatility is expected due to stretched valuations, the long-term structural story remains intact. With defence spending set to rise and strong policy support in place, the sector offers solid potential. However, investors should stay selective—focusing on companies with strong financials, robust order books, and proven execution. Chasing short-term momentum may be risky, but fundamentally sound defence stocks remain attractive for long-term portfolios,"" he said.

"VIP Industries faced 'management crisis' over last few years, says promoter Dilip Piramal, ownership change 'best thing' for company",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/vip-industries-faced-management-crisis-over-last-few-years-says-promoter-dilip-piramal-ownership-change-best-thing-for-company-13275407.html,"All that is needed at luggage maker VIP Industries is good management, and the company is in a structurally good position to compete globally with a 'fantastic long-term future', promoter Dilip Piramal told CNBC-TV18 during an interaction on July 14, a day after the promoter family announced selling 32 percent stake in the company to PE player Multiples Consortium, which has led to a change in the ownership. Shares of VIP Industries - world’s second-largest luggage maker - are higher by over 2 percent in mid-day trade after a weak start. On a YTD basis, the share a nearly flat - down only 4 percent - having recovered from April lows, and over the last one year, the shares are down a mere 2 percent. Talking about the deal that has been in the making for some time, Dilip Piramal pointed out that the professional management of the company was not able to deliver in a segment where competitive intensity was rising, and bringing in private equity to run VIP made sense to him as ownership also ensure there is skin in the game. ""We have continued our market leadership but in the last five years, we have not been doing well. I would say we have had a management crisis in the last two-three years and our market shares is going down. The younger generations are not interested in the management,"" said Dilip Piramal. While the company has always had a professional managing director since 1984, Dilip Piramal said he found that ""professional management was not being able to run it well"", and the company incurred four quarters of losses last year. ""For the interest of shareholders, we needed a change of management as well as a change of ownership,"" Piramal added. ""The only aim of private equity is to increase value, they are dedicated to that, and are experts in that."" Piramal, who will be the Chairman Emeritus of the company after the conclusion of the deal, added that the decision is the 'best thing' for the company, and he will refrain from recommending any management changes to Multiples Consortium, as PE will run the company. The Piramal family will have a representative Director on the board of the firm, which will likely be Dilip Piramal's wife, to represent the promoter family. However, the Piramal family will have the option to bring down their stake to 8 percent in five years, with Multiples have the Right of First Refusal to his stake in the firm. Dilip Piramal also pointed out that India is the only market where MNC players are not the market leader in the luggage segment, and VIP has had a long stint of leadership. However, last couple of years have seen the share price of VIP Industries taper off from an all-time high of Rs 774.60 per share, even though the management had projected a recovery, but it has not played out, Piramal added. When asked what prompted him to sell his stake at a lower price, Piramal said, ""That is the tragedy. Two years ago the share was around Rs 700 per share and the market cap was around Rs 10,000 crore. We got an offer at that price but my management at that time said in 6-12 months the share price will go up by 50 percent and in two years even 100 percent. Unfortunately that hasn't happened."" Reacting to the deal, Renuka Ramnath Founder, MD and CEO of Multiples Alternate Asset Management had said, ""Multiples is excited to lead the ownership transition of the very strong legacy business of VIP and further build on its rich heritage and unlock its next phase of growth."""

The electric two-wheeler posted a consolidated net loss of Rs 428 crore in Q1FY26, narrowing it from Rs 870 crore in Q4FY25. However, the loss widened year-on-year (YOY) from Rs 347 crore in Q1FY25. The Bengaluru-based firm said its revenue from operations for the April-June quarter rose 35.5 per cent to Rs 828 crore, as against Rs 611 crore during the quarter ended March 31, 2025. Shares of Ola Electric settled 19.75 percent higher at Rs 47.66 per share on the NSE, after the April - June quarter results. The stock has gained after five days of consecutive fall. Ola Electric Q1FY26 results: Net loss widens to Rs 428 crore, revenue down 50% YoY The company said it delivered a total of 68,192 vehicles in Q1 FY26, as against 51,375 units delivered in Q4 FY25, marking an increase of 32.7 percent quarter-on-quarter. It added that it's auto business turned EBITDA positive in June, on the back of strong gross margins owing to the company's vertical integration strategy. The company also expects the auto business to remain EBITDA positive from Q2 onwards, it noted.

"Landmark Cars shares rise 6% as B&K sees over 60% upside, bets on margin revival, scale-up",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/landmark-cars-shares-rise-6-as-b-k-sees-over-60-upside-bets-on-margin-revival-scale-up-13274968.html,"Shares of Landmark Cars Ltd. rose as much as 6 percent to Rs 537 on Monday, July 14, after domestic brokerage B&K Securities initiated coverage on the stock with a bullish outlook, citing strong growth potential and improving profitability over the next two years. The brokerage has assigned a 'Buy' rating with a price target of Rs 820, signalling a potential upside of more than 60 percent from Friday’s close of Rs 507 per share on the NSE. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates In its initiation note, B&K pointed out that while Landmark’s proforma and reported revenues grew at a compound annual growth rate of 11 percent and 9 percent, respectively, between FY23 and FY25, the company’s profitability metrics — EBITDA, PBT, and PAT — witnessed declines of 3 percent, 20 percent, and 55 percent. However, analysts expect the tide to turn soon. Despite profitability pressures, Landmark’s revenue growth outpaced industry trends. Its 11 percent proforma sales growth was nearly double the Indian passenger vehicle market’s CAGR of 5 percent over the same period. The drag on profitability largely came from the company’s expansion drive. While its established outlets delivered Rs 70 crore in PBT during FY25, the 17 new workshops and showrooms opened recently posted combined losses of Rs 40 crore. The new facilities, however, are expected to reach breakeven by the first quarter of FY26, with most turning profitable by year-end, B&K noted. The company’s recent tie-ups with Mahindra & Mahindra, Kia, and MG Motors are also expected to support future growth.

It holds leading positions with brands such as Mercedes-Benz, BYD, Jeep, Volkswagen, Honda, and MG Motors. Landmark’s after-sales revenue mix — currently at 17 percent for older brands — stands at just 9 percent for the newer ones. The brokerage expects this figure to rise steadily, helping push overall margins from 5.5 percent to 7.5 percent over FY25–FY27. B&K described the company as a “moated business” with high OEM switching costs, capital-intensive entry barriers, and professional management under Sanjay Thakker — all of which make Landmark Cars well-positioned to benefit from ongoing industry consolidation. At about 12:30 pm, shares of the company were trading at Rs 524, higher by 3.18 percent from the last close on the NSE. Landmark Cars' stock price is down over 17 percent since the beginning of the year.

Buy Hindustan Unilever; target of Rs 3000: Motilal Oswal,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-hindustan-unilever-target-of-rs-3000-motilal-oswal-13275061.html,"Motilal Oswal's research report on Hindustan Unilever Hindustan Unilever (HUVR) announced that Ms. Priya Nair, current President of Beauty & Wellbeing at Unilever, will be appointed CEO and MD of the company, effective 1st Aug’25, for a period of five years. Ms. Nair will replace Mr. Rohit Jawa, who will step down on 31st Jul’25 to pursue the next chapter in his personal and professional journey, the company said. We are surprised by the move because Mr. Jawa is leaving HUVR after a two-year tenure with the company, the shortest and unprecedented in the company’s history (also leaving Unilever Group). He had chalked out a volume priority plan for FY26, which we considered as a mean-revision opportunity for the company. Ms. Nair, the first woman CEO of HUVR, brings various positive possibilities for the India business. She has 30 years of experience at Unilever, with most of it handling the company’s India portfolio. She has a successful legacy in the Home Care and B&W portfolios. Home Care in HUVR’s India portfolio has seen a massive premiumization drive under her leadership. Outlook HUVR in the 4Q earnings concall downgraded its EBITDA margin guidance to 22-23% from 23-24% to increase spending on marketing and promotion. We expect the cost impact will be front-ended and volume pickup will be gradual.

"Silver rallies to fresh all-time high, nears Rs 1.15 lakh per kg mark; Hindustan Zinc shares up 2%",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/silver-rallies-to-fresh-all-time-high-nears-rs-1-15-lakh-per-kg-mark-hindustan-zinc-shares-up-2-13274888.html,"Silver prices rallied to fresh lifetime highs on July 14, overpowering the shine in gold. This pushed the shares of Hindustan Zinc up nearly 2 percent in morning trade. The shares of Hindustan Zinc, which is the largest producer of silver in India, were trading at around Rs 434 apiece. Silver at all-time highs Silver's future contracts with September expiry on Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) hit an all-time high of Rs 1,14,875 per kg today. The metal's future contracts with December expiry meanwhile hit a fresh lifetime high of Rs 1,16,566 per kg. Silver was trading at around Rs 1.15 lakh per kg in the domestic markets, according to data on Good Returns. The sharp rise in silver prices came as its safe haven appeal outshone the downturn in the equity market amid global uncertainties. US President Donald Trump on July 12 threatened to impose a 30 percent tariff on imports from Mexico and the European Union starting on August 1. Earlier, he slapped 35 percent tariff on Canada, while warning of further hikes if they retaliate. Additionally, rupee opened 21 paise lower on rising dollar amid renewed tariff threats from US President Donald Trump, intensifying trade concerns. This further strengthened silver prices. Gold rallies Gold prices also surged. The yellow metal's August futures on the MCX were trading at around Rs 98,170 per 10 grams. Domestic rates of gold rose, with the price of 10 grams of 24k gold standing at around Rs 99,880. Here's what analyst says ""Silver outshined most commodities last week with marking an all-time high mark on domestic front and hovering around $40 on COMEX. Gold prices also touched a three-week high, supported by safe-haven demand after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 30% tariff on imports from the European Union (EU) and Mexico starting on August 1. Both the EU and Mexico described the tariffs unfair and disruptive, while the E.U. said it would extend its suspension of countermeasures to U.S. tariffs until early August and continue to press for a negotiated settlement. Chicago Fed Bank President Austan Goolsbee said the new tariffs unveiled by Trump could spark fresh concerns about inflation, which might force the Fed to maintain its wait-and-see posture,"" said Manav Modi, Senior Analyst of Commodity Research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services. ""Investors now await the U.S. inflation data for June due tomorrow for more cues on the Federal Reserve's interest rate path. Markets are currently pricing in just over 50 bps worth of Fed easing by December,"" he added. Harshal Dasani, Business Head at INVasset PMS, said, ""Silver has finally stepped out of gold’s shadow, commanding attention on the back of global volatility and surging industrial demand...as supply constraints and geopolitical concerns sent safe-haven assets into overdrive. What's unique this time is that the rally isn't driven by retail investors or jewellery demand—it's largely a structural re-rating."" ""Silver isn’t following gold anymore—it’s leading. And this time, its shine comes from utility, not just tradition,"" he added. Dasani however cautioned investors about gold. ""Unlike silver, gold may not see explosive moves in the near term. It is transitioning into a slower, more stable accumulation phase. The wild swings are behind us—for now...In the longer term, gold continues to be a strategic asset in portfolios. As the global economic cycle softens and real yields compress, gold is expected to gradually trend higher. For investors, this is a phase to stay patient, stay allocated, and let the macro tailwinds play out,"" he said. Hindustan Zinc is the largest producer of silver in India, and produces refined silver with a minimum 99.9 percent purity. The sharp rise in the bullion's prices is expected to further boost the stock. Despite today's gains, the shares of the company have dropped nearly 16 percent in the past one month. This was fuelled after American short-seller Viceroy Research levelled strong allegations against Vedanta Resources, calling it a 'Ponzi scheme' and 'Parasite holding company'. The group's management has strongly denied the claims. JPMorgan meanwhile said investors shouldn't get distracted by the allegations. For Hindustan Zinc, the international brokerage had said that the Indian government continues to maintain an active presence on its board, Mint reported. It added that government oversight continues to be effective, especially concerning capex planning.

"Garden Reach Shipbuilders shares slide for third day as retail, MF holdings dip in June",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/garden-reach-shipbuilders-shares-slide-for-third-day-as-retail-mf-holdings-dip-in-june-13274537.html,"Shares of Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers Ltd (GRSE) extended their losing streak for the third consecutive session on Monday, July 14, slipping as much as 5 percent to Rs 2,645, as selling pressure intensified amid waning investor interest. Fresh shareholding data released by the company points to a shift in investor sentiment during the April–June quarter. Retail participation saw a noticeable dip, with the number of small shareholders — those holding shares with up to Rs 2 lakh in value — declining to 3.97 lakh from 4.04 lakh in the March quarter. In percentage terms, retail investor ownership fell to 14.89 percent from 16.72 percent previously. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Domestic mutual funds also trimmed their exposure slightly. Their collective holding dropped to 1.4 percent in June, down from 1.64 percent in March. Notably, HDFC Mutual Fund, which featured among shareholders in the March quarter, no longer appears in the list — indicating that its stake has slipped below the 1 percent threshold. In contrast, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) appear to have taken a more bullish view. Their holding in GRSE rose to 5.33 percent in the June quarter, up from 3.84 percent earlier, suggesting selective overseas interest despite the recent pressure on the stock.

"Castrol India shares rally on favourable ruling in Rs 4,131 crore MVAT dispute with Maharashtra",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/castrol-india-shares-rally-on-favourable-ruling-in-rs-4-131-crore-in-mvat-dispute-with-maharashtra-13274509.html,"Shares of Castrol India are higher by nearly 4 percent on July 14, after the company said in an exchange filing that the Customs Excise & Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (CESTAT) has ruled in its favour, in a Rs 4,131 crore tax dispute with the Maharashtra Sales Tax Department (MSTD). ""...on 11 July 2025 CESTAT pronounced an order in favour of the Company rejecting the appeals of MSTD for the period of 9 years i.e. from 2007-08 to 2015-16 and for 2017-18,"" the lubricant maker said on July 11. The clarity in the tax case has supported investor interest in the shares, which is higher on volumes that are 4x the one-month average. Over the last one year, the shares are down by 9 percent but on a YTD basis the shares are higher by 15 percent. In 2023, the shares of Castrol India were higher by 46 percent. Castrol India has not made any provision in its books for the amount involved in the dispute i.e. Rs 4,131 crore, since the likelihood of an economic outflow was 'considered as remote', the company said, citing that there have been decisions of tribunal / courts in favour of industry in such cases, supporting Castrol India's position. ""The Company’s tax payment methodology in respect of the goods sold is adequately supported by robust legal grounds/precedents and in Company’s opinion the said demands are unjustified. Thus considering the favourable orders from MVAT Tribunal and based on the legal advice the Company has not made any provision in the books for the year ended December 31, 2024 and the possibility of outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is considered to be remote,"" Castrol India had said in its annual report in FY24. The company had received demand orders amounting to Rs 4,131 crore for the period 2007-08 to 2017-18 (10 years) from the MSTD over movement of goods from its warehouses in Maharashtra to Clearing and Forwarding Agents (CFAs) in other states. The MSTD had alleged that such movements of goods constituted inter-state sales to pre-existing customer orders in destination states. Castrol India contested these claims of MSTD, and said that the goods were not dispatched under any prior customer orders and the company’s tax payments on the goods were valid. The company had received favor order from the MVAT tribunal in the case, however, the MSTD appealed before the CESTAT against the orders for 9 out of 10 years. On July 11, 2025 CESTAT in an order ruled in favour of Castrol India, rejecting the tax department's appeal. Castrol India had on July 7 announced the appointment of Mrinalini Srinivasan as its new Chief Financial Officer, effective 28 July, 2025."

Hold Avenue Supermarts; target of Rs 3923: Prabhudas Lilladher,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/hold-avenue-supermarts-target-of-rs-3923-prabhudas-lilladher-13274357.html,"Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Avenue Supermarts We cut our FY26/FY27 EPS estimates by 1.0%/1.9%, respectively, as we expect margin pressures to persist due to 1) Continued high competitive intensity driven by a consumer shift toward e-commerce and quick commerce platforms and 2) Accelerated store expansion in a subdued demand environment, softer gross margins, increased spending on customer service, and rising store-level wages, especially in metro areas. D’Mart’s Q1 results missed estimates, as intense competition and higher overheads weighed on margins. Operational metrics remained stable in Q1, with sales per store and sales per square foot growing 1.9%/1.5% YoY. The cost of retail increased by 50 basis points on higher overheads. GMA proportion stabilized with 24.7% contribution in 1Q vs 24.89% in Q1FY25. D’Mart might see competition from Ecom/ QC in non-apparel GMA as they are trying to increase their presence in higher margin non-grocery segments. Outlook We estimate 9.3% EPS growth in FY26 and 12.9% CAGR over FY25-27. We cut DCF based target price to Rs3923 (4063 earlier). We expect back ended returns given heightened competition in Food and Grocery retail. Maintain Hold.
