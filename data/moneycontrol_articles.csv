OTM butterfly for slow market: Shubham Agarwal,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/expert-columns/otm-butterfly-for-slow-market-shubham-agarwal-13420465.html,"Butterfly is one of the most celebrated strategies after the margin benefits were introduced. Butterfly strategy is a strategy adopted by many option sellers. However, little credit has been given to Butterfly by Option buyers who are more interested in directional moves. Before we go into its use, let us understand what the Butterfly strategy is. Butterfly is a strategy that involves selling 2 options close to the current market price of the stock or index and buying a higher strike price option and a lower strike price option. A butterfly made with all calls is called a Call Butterfly, and with all Puts is called a Put Butterfly. The favourite of option sellers is selling both Call and Put of strike close to the current market price and buying a Higher strike Call and a Lower strike Put. This is called Iron Butterfly. For directional trades, we will restrict ourselves to Call and Put Butterfly, and we will go OTM. OTM or Out of the Money options are higher strike Call options and lower strike Put options. They are called OTM because if the stock had to expire exactly at the current price, these options would not make any money. Now, let us look at the slow-moving market to understand how OTM Butterflies can help. A slow-moving market, especially in the first half of the monthly expiry, is very difficult for a directional option trader. Especially when the premiums are too expensive due to a lot of time-related value in them. The first problem is cost. Second problem with these expensive options early in the expiry is that if it takes 2 weeks for the stock to move, the premium reduction due to passage of time is so severe that there is very little profit left for the trader despite the right call on direction. On the other hand, if we are towards the end of the expiry, the premiums are less expensive, but the loss due to the passage of time is very fast. In either case, the problem still remains of not being able to wait longer in the trade. Both are critical problems to be dealt with. Both of them can be cleared by a Call/Put Butterfly depending on the direction. Example of an OTM Call Butterfly Let us say you are bullish on a stock trading at 1000 with a target of 1040 1010 Call @ 13 1040 Call @ 5 1070 Call @ 2 Now, the choice is to buy 1010 Call at 13 and sit on it. 1040 comes after 20 days, and with 2-3 days to expiry, the Option trades around 30. Profit of 17. Or we create a Butterfly with Buy 1010, Sell 2 1040, and Buy 1070 Call. Ne Premium out is 5. Maximum profit = Diff between Buy and Sell strike (1040-1010 = 30) – Net Premium Paid (5) = 25. Here, if we go wrong, we lose 5 vs losing 13 in the Call bought. Also, the strategy on the day of expiry is profitable after 1015, whereas the 1010 Call on expiry is profitable only after 1023.

More than 40 small-cap stocks drop 10-24% amid tariff concerns,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/more-than-40-small-cap-stocks-drop-10-24-amid-tariff-concerns-13429906.html,"The broader indices underperformed the main indices and continued the fall in the third consecutive week, led by volatility amid better auto numbers, mixed earnings, and persistent FII selling after the US imposed additional tariffs on India. For the week, BSE Large-cap and Mid-cap indices shed 1 percent each, and the BSE Small-cap index slipped nearly 2 percent. For the week, the BSE Sensex index shed 742.12 points or 0.92 percent to finish at 79,857.79, while Nifty50 shed 202.05 points or 0.82 percent to end at 24,363.30. The Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) extended their selling in their sixth consecutive week, as they sold equities worth Rs 10,652.47 crore, despite remaining buyers in the final day of the week. On the other hand, Domestic Institutional Investors (DII) extended their buying in the 16th week, as they purchased equities worth Rs 33,608.66 crore. In this month on August so far, FII sold equities worth Rs 14,018.87 crore and DII bought equities worth Rs 36,795.52 crore. On the sectoral, Nifty Pharma, Realty, FMCG, Healthcare, lost 2 percent each, while PSU Bank, media, and metal rose 0.5-1.5 percent. ""Since July, the Indian equity market has remained in a phase of consolidation, reflecting weakening investor sentiment due to trade-aligned challenges. Concerns over steep US tariff rates and underwhelming quarterly earnings have dampened market confidence. Persistent selling by FIIs, particularly in pharma stocks with significant US exposure, underscores this cautious outlook. The continued depreciation of the INR has also added to investor anxiety,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments. ""Despite these headwinds, downside risks were partially cushioned by RBI’s reaffirmation of macroeconomic stability, its optimistic stance on domestic growth, and early signs of easing inflation. Looking ahead, market volatility is expected to persist. While risks from US trade tensions and sustained FII outflows remain, potential support from DIIs could offer some relief."" ""Upcoming inflation data from both India and the US will be critical in shaping investor expectations. Market participants are advised to closely track global trade developments and corporate earnings, with a strategic focus on domestic consumption-driven sectors that are better positioned to withstand short-term volatility,"" he added. The BSE Small-cap index slipped nearly 2 percent with PG Electroplast, Kitex Garments, Unichem Laboratories, Morepen Laboratories, Advait Energy Transitions, KR Rail Engineering, Faze Three, and Advanced Enzyme Technologies falling between 15-24 percent. However, Sarda Energy and Minerals, Timex Group India, Sanghvi Movers, Zinka Logistics Solutions, Centum Electronics, KRBL, Baazar Style Retail, Godfrey Phillips India, and Entertainment Network India gained between 12-21 percent.  Where is Nifty50 headed? Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Lingering uncertainty over the tariff situation, coupled with continued selling by FIIs, has been weighing on market sentiment. The medium-term moving average—the 100-day EMA—near the 24,600 mark, which earlier acted as support, is now serving as an immediate resistance. A close below 24,450 signals the continuation of the corrective phase, with a potential retest of the long-term moving average—the 200-day EMA—near 24,200. Traders are advised to align their positions accordingly, with greater emphasis on risk management."" Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The Nifty moved southward as it failed to sustain above the 50 EMA on the hourly chart, indicating prevailing selling pressure. Moreover, the index closed below the crucial support level of 24,400, highlighting the strength of the bears. Sentiment was already tilted in favour of the bears, with the index forming a lower-top, lower-bottom pattern. The short-term trend remains weak, with potential downside towards 24,150–24,200. On the higher side, resistance is seen at 24,475–24,500. Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities After witnessing a sustainable bounce back from the lows on Thursday, Nifty witnessed sharp selloff on Friday. A long bear candle was formed on the daily chart that completely negated the bullish sentiment created on Thursday. A long negative candle has been formed on the weekly chart which is for the sixth consecutive week on the trot. The formation of long upper shadows in the last 4-5 weekly candles signals sell on every rise in the market. The underlying trend of Nifty continues to be weak. The next lower levels to be watched around 24200-24000 by next week. However, any pullback up to the hurdle of 24500 could be a sell on rise opportunity.

Management said ICE margins have been under stress for some time, with an additional blow from commodity inflation in the June quarter, driven mainly by higher steel prices, safeguard duty of 12 percent and forex risks.

Tata Motors races to secure rare earth magnet supply amid global risks,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/tata-motors-races-to-secure-rare-earth-magnet-supply-amid-global-risks-13425916.html,"Tata Motors is taking no chances with its electric vehicle supply chain, as rare earth magnets—vital for EV motors—emerge as a potential global choke point. While production remains unaffected for now, the company is already working on alternatives to secure future supplies. Group CFO P.B. Balaji, speaking on the Q1 FY26 earnings call, said the company is evaluating all options: ""Redesigning, including lighter ones, including different sources, including different substitutes being put in place."" Also read: FPIs have been sanguine about Indian markets: NSE CEO on market reaction to Trump tariffs The push comes amid rising global concern over China’s dominance in rare earth supplies, which could spark shortages or price spikes in the event of geopolitical tension. Tata Motors, along with its UK-based unit Jaguar Land Rover, is preparing to respond with a multi-pronged strategy—ranging from supplier diversification to component redesign. Domestically, the company said it is covered for the next 2-3 months, and it is looking at alternatives outside of China. Balaji pointed out that past experiences have shaped this proactive stance. ""The learnings coming from the semiconductor crisis have meant that we have been off the blocks quite fast. And that has helped us cope with this quite well, both here (at Tata Motors) and in JLR. And that is what we are executing.” For now, there is no change to Tata Motors’ production or launch plans, but the company isn’t waiting for disruptions to materialise. Apart from this, Jaguar Land Rover is staring at a roadblock in China after the government cut the luxury tax threshold from 1.3 million RMB (Chinese yuan) to 900,000 RMB, pulling almost all Range Rover sales into the tax net and adding an extra 10 percent levy in a market where retail finance remains tight.

Recent trade agreements have eased the blow from an initially proposed 1,000 percent hike, but duties will still rise sharply — about 300 percent for vehicles built in the UK and 500 percent for those from Europe. These tariffs directly raise the landed cost of JLR’s cars in the US, potentially squeezing margins and limiting pricing flexibility. A planned 15 percent reduction in these rates is yet to take effect, meaning elevated costs will persist in one of its most important overseas markets.

Losses were broad-based, with autos, metals, IT and pharma leading the decline. At close, the Sensex was down 765.47 points or 0.95 percent at 79,857.79, and the Nifty was down 232.85 points or 0.95 percent at 24,363.30.

Thursday’s sharp 250-point rebound in the Nifty from its intraday low was largely driven by short covering, sparked by strong domestic institutional investor (DII) purchases worth Rs 10,864 crore. With market sentiment weighed down by tariff tensions between India and the US, FIIs are expected to keep trimming their cash market exposure. However, robust DII inflows, backed by steady mutual fund investments, are helping cushion the market and could prevent a deeper sell-off, V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments Ltd, said. Sectoral indices on the NSE were largely in the red, with realty (-1.93%), metal (-1.71%), consumer durables (-1.64%), and midcaps (-1.49%) seeing the sharpest losses. Auto, pharma, infrastructure, private banks, and IT stocks also weighed on sentiment, while PSU banks and media ended only marginally lower. The Nifty Bank fell 0.78 percent, while FMCG and energy slipped 0.72 percent and 0.53 percent, respectively. Oil & gas was the sole gainer, inching up 0.06 percent. Volatility picked up, with India VIX rising 2.05 percent to 11.93. Among individual stocks, Coforge slipped 6 percent to Rs 1,605 in the afternoon on August 8, sinking for the third time in four sessions and wiping over 10 percent in just four days, after key client Sabre Corp plunged 35 percent on the Nasdaq overnight following a lacklustre quarterly report.

With this move, the stock has now risen 67 percent from its IPO price in just three trading sessions. Tata Motors slipped over a percent, marking its third straight day of losses, as investors turned cautious ahead of the automaker’s Q1 results later today, with analysts bracing for a sharp decline in profit and revenue. According to a Moneycontrol poll of six brokerage firms, the Nexon maker is anticipated to record an 8.7 percent year-on-year decrease in revenue, reaching Rs 98,600 crore. Technical View ""Immediate support lies at 24,450, aligning with a previous demand zone. Unless breached decisively, any dip is likely to attract fresh buying interest. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart hovers around 40 but has started showing a positive divergence, hinting at easing bearish momentum. Intraday indicators also signal a reversal from oversold territory. The overall structure remains oversold, suggesting that any pullbacks may offer opportunities to initiate fresh long positions as optimism gradually returns,"" Dhupesh Dhameja of SAMCO Securities said. Titan Company, NTPC, HDFC Life, Dr Reddy's Laboratories, and Coal India were the top gainers on the Nifty. Laggards on the Nifty included Adani Enterprises, Bharti Airtel, Shriram Finance, IndusInd Bank, and Hindalco.

Growth was led by textile & apparel, though garmenting faced headwinds due to uncertainty around the US tariffs. EBITDA grew 29% YoY, though 35% below our estimate as margins got impacted by higher marketing spends and scale deleverage in garmenting. Managementis confident of a margin recovery in 2H. Although the overall demand environment remains challenging, there are signs of improvement, with stronger momentum in order bookings. Post a sharp correction (down 46% YTD), its valuation appears attractive at ~19x FY27E PE or ~1x FY27 EV/sales. However, we believe improvement in execution and sustained growth recovery remain key for re-rating. We cut our FY26-27E EPS by ~11-14% due to weaker margins and the impact of the US tariff-related uncertainty in the garmenting segment. We build in ~9% revenue CAGR over FY25-28E, with margins expanding to 12.3% by FY28. Outlook We value RLL at 22x Sep’27E P/E to arrive at our revised TP of INR1,425.

Biocon gears up to ride weight-loss drug boom to script next growth chapter,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/biocon-gears-up-to-ride-weight-loss-drug-boom-to-script-next-growth-chapter-13423370.html,"Biocon is betting big on GLP-1 therapies and peptides to drive its next wave of growth, as global demand for weight-loss and diabetes treatments accelerates. The company is preparing for a day-one launch of semaglutide in select markets, with filings underway and approvals expected by late 2026 or early 2027, managing director and chief executive officer Siddharth Mittal told Moneycontrol. He was referring to the expiry of semaglutide patent in India and several other countries in 2026, which will pave the way for its generic versions. The Bengaluru-based drugmaker is also looking to fill the void left by multinational players as they pivot away from insulin to GLP-1 therapies, backed by expanded capacity in Malaysia and new approvals in the US, Europe and other markets. “We are the only other large insulin manufacturer with expanded capacity,” Mittal said in an interview. “We think we are very well placed to benefit from this refocus of innovators from insulin to GLP.” Biocon’s insulin manufacturing capacity expansion in Malaysia is expected to come online by the end of this fiscal, he said. The company is doubling the capacity to capture market share in geographies where multinational companies such as Novo Nordisk are exiting the insulin segment, particularly in human insulin. Biocon recently secured USFDA approval for Kirsty, its interchangeable biosimilar insulin aspart, and is preparing for a “meaningful launch” in the fiscal fourth quarter, aligned with contracting cycles. The company also received approval for liraglutide, which is used in treating type 2 diabetes, in India and Europe, with launches underway through commercialisation partners. Peptides and GLP-1s: The next frontier Biocon is building a robust pipeline of peptides targeting weight loss, diabetes, and dermatology. “We were the first company in the world to get generic liraglutide approved in an ICH market (like the UK, Europe and Canada),” Mittal said. Globally, the GLP-1 segment is booming, with liraglutide alone generating over $1.6 billion in annual sales. Biocon’s peptide capabilities are expected to play a pivotal role in capturing this opportunity. Its generics business is seeing traction from launches like lenalidomide, dasatinib in the US and liraglutide in the European Union. The company is also advancing approvals for rivaroxaban and everolimus in the US. “Pricing pressure is stable at 5–7 percent, but product-level dynamics vary,” Mittal said. Rivaroxaban is used to treat deep vein thrombosis. Everolimus is an immunosuppressant used to prevent rejection of organ transplants and also in the treatment of renal cell cancer and other tumours. In biosimilars, Biocon has launched Yesafili in Canada and received European approvals for denosumab. Its oncology portfolio continues to lead in the US, with Fulphila and Ogivri holding 27 percent market share each. Tariff preparedness While pharma remains exempt from US tariffs for now, Biocon is de-risking its supply chain. “We’ve got two facilities in the US, expanded oral solid dosage capacity in New Jersey, and local partnerships like Civica Rx for insulin manufacturing,” Mittal said. “We’re scenario-mapping but there’s a limit to how much we can do.” With a strong start to FY26, Biocon expects double-digit growth across biosimilars, generics, and CRDMO. The company raised Rs 4,500 crore through QIP, which has strengthened its balance sheet. The funds will be used to increase its stake in Biocon Biologics. “We’re aligning our business with shifting global policy and supply chain dynamics,” Mittal said. “The next few years will be about scaling what we’ve built and leading in the segments that matter.”"

Net jewelry store additions stood at 19 in 1Q, bringing the total count to 1,110. Standalone jewelry LFL growth was 11%, and CaratLane posted a robust 39% YoY growth.

This will result in a sequential recovery in margins to 12% by 4QFY26 (normalized levels), fueled by operating leverage and absence of inventory losses.

Weak earnings by some of the key players, profit booking and lack of fresh triggers fuelled the downturn in the sector. The defence index dropped to 7,662, as seen at 2 pm. The index has now extended losses for the third consecutive session. Defence shares came in focus after the Indian military in May conducted targeted strikes against terrorist outfits in Pakistan and Pakistan occupied Kashmir under the codename 'Operation Sindoor'. As the geopolitical tensions between India and Pakistan eased, the escalating wars between Russia-Ukraine and Israel - Iran further boosted the stocks. Additionally, NATO members agreed to a big increase in their defence spending target, which fuelled the bullish sentiment further. The Nifty India Defence index jumped a whopping 42 percent since 2024 closing to hit a record high in June. However, as geopolitical tensions around the globe continue to ease, the defence stocks declined. Analysts flagged elevated valuations, despite the positive sentiment around the stocks. Data Patterns shares dropped nearly 6 percent to trade at Rs 2,426 apiece. The company on August 7 reported a 22 percent YoY and 75 percent QoQ drop in net profit to Rs 25.5 crore for Q1 FY26. Its revenue from operations meanwhile tumbled around 75 percent sequentially to Rs 99 crore during the quarter under review. Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders shares declined nearly 5 percent to trade at Rs 2,657 apiece. The company on July 28 reported a net profit of Rs 452 crore for the first quarter of the financial year 2026. This marks a decline of around 35 percent on-year from the Rs 696 crore net profit reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year. DCX India, Paras Defence and Bharat Dynamics (BDL) shares dropped up to 4 percent each, while Solar Industries, Cochin Shipyard and Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) shares fell more than 2 percent each. Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers (GRSE), BEML and Bharat Electronics (BEL) shares were trading in the red with marginal losses. GRSE on August 8 reported a net profit of Rs 120 crore for Q1 FY26. This marks a 38 percent on-year rise from the Rs 87 crore net profit reported in Q1 FY25. However, net profit nearly halved sequentially from the Rs 244 crore reported in Q4 FY25. ""Indian defence stocks have entered a consolidation phase after a strong rally earlier this year...recent price action suggests a cooling-off period. Some institutional investors have begun booking profits, especially in stocks that had run up sharply. Valuations, in certain cases, had moved well ahead of fundamentals, prompting a tactical pullback...The sector’s trajectory from here is likely to be more measured—balancing near-term volatility with medium-term promise. Selectivity and disciplined entry points will be critical as defence transforms from a thematic play into a core allocation theme over the coming years,"" said Bhavik Joshi, Business Head, INVasset PMS.

"Metal, realty stocks down up to 5 percent as Trump tariffs weigh: Here are the top losers",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/metal-realty-stocks-down-up-to-5-percent-as-trump-tariffs-weigh-here-are-the-top-losers-13422712.html,"The shares of metal and real estate companies were under selling pressure on August 8, tracking the weakness in overall market after US President's tariff decision. The Nifty Metal index was down nearly 2 percent, while Nifty Realty index was down over a percent, extending losses for a fourth session. US President Trump on August 6 doubled tariffs on India to a whopping 50 percent, the highest among its Asian peers. He cited India’s Russian oil imports as a key reason for the tariff hike. While metals have been excluded from the latest tariff hike, the already existing steep duties continue to put pressure on the stocks. Global pricing and demand pressures could further influence the sector's performance. Meanwhile, the Rupee has strengthened against the US dollar, after it opened 15 paise higher on August 8, overlooking Trump’s comments ruling out trade talks with India. As rupee strengthens against dollar, it becomes more expensive for foreign buyers to purchase metal from Indian companies, thus putting further pressure on shares. Real estate companies derive majority of their revenue from domestic market, however, rising metal prices as a result of the tariffs could increase input costs, which in turn may affect their margins. Property stocks have further declined after RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra announced the MPC’s decision to keep repo rate unchanged at 5.5 percent. The repo rate directly influence home loan interest rates, affecting EMIs and loan costs, hence, a rate pause may dampen sentiment. Weak earnings by some of the key players too has put pressure on the shares. Jindal Stainless Steel was the top loser on the Nifty Metal index, dropping nearly 5 percent, Adani Enterprises shares fell more than 3 percent, while JSW Steel and Jindal Steel & Power shares fell nearly 2 percent each. Hindustan Copper and SAIL shares were down over a percent each. Vedanta, National Aluminium Company (NALCO) and Tata Steel shares were down nearly a percent while APL Apollo Tubes, NMDC and Hind Zinc shares were in the red with marginal losses. Sobha and Godrej Properties shares were the top losers on the Nifty Realty index, dropping nearly 3 percent each. Phoenix Mills and Oberoi Realty shares fell nearly 2 percent each, while Prestige Estates, Anant Raj and Raymond shares dropped more than 1 percent each. Macrotech Developers (Lodha), DLF and Brigade Enterprises shares were down up to 1 percent.

Buy Hero MotoCorp; target of Rs 5304: LKP Research,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-hero-motocorp-target-of-rs-5304-lkp-research-13422904.html,"LKP Research's research report on Hero MotoCorp Hero MotoCorp reported muted performance in Q1FY26, with revenue at ₹95.8 bn, declining 5.6% YoY and 3.6% QoQ, primarily impacted by (1) a temporary production pause, (2) seasonality in the Parts, Accessories, and Merchandise segment, which weighed on ASPs, and (3) broader industry headwinds. The company implemented price hikes related to OBD compliance, phased across Q4FY25 and Q1FY26. While commodity costs rose ~0.5% QoQ, management remains confident in offsetting the impact through its ongoing LEAP cost-saving program, which continues to deliver meaningful gains. EBITDA margin stood at 14.4%, largely flat YoY, supported by gross margin expansion driven by a favorable product mix, pricing actions, and disciplined cost management. However, this was partially offset by negative operating leverage due to lower volumes. PBT came in at ₹14.9 bn, stable YoY, with PBT margin improving to 15.5% (up 80bps YoY / 101bps QoQ), aided by higher other income. We expect EBITDA margins to remain in the 14.5%-15% range in FY26E-27E, supported by a favourable product mix and ongoing cost optimization measures, including gains from the LEAP program. Outlook We expect Revenue/EBITDA/PBT to grow at a CAGR of 8.1%/ 10.8%/ 9.7% over FY25–FY27E, with favourable product mix, operating leverage, and EV ramp-up serving as key catalysts. We value company at a P/E of 19x on earnings of FY27E and raise our target to ₹5,304.

Coforge shares slide 6% after major client’s weak quarterly results rattle investors,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/coforge-shares-slide-6-after-major-client-s-weak-quarterly-results-rattle-investors-13422363.html,"Shares of Coforge slipped 6 percent to Rs 1,605 in the afternoon on August 8, sinking for the third time in four sessions and wiping over 10 percent in just four days, after key client Sabre Corp plunged 35 percent on the Nasdaq overnight following a lacklustre quarterly report. Sabre’s revenue and EBITDA for the current quarter came in below earlier projections, prompting the travel technology firm to sharply scale back its full-year outlook. Growth in Air Distribution Volumes is now expected at just 4–10 percent, compared to its previous double-digit forecast. Revenue guidance was cut to flat-to-low single-digit growth from high single digits earlier, while adjusted pro forma EBITDA guidance was lowered to $530–570 million from $630 million. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Under a 13-year agreement, Coforge is a key partner for Sabre, tasked with bolstering product delivery and building AI-powered solutions. The midcap IT firm posted an 8 percent growth in revenue in constant currency terms for the June quarter. The performance also sharply contrasted with Persistent Systems and LTIMindtree, which reported CC growth of 3.3 percent and 0.8 percent, respectively. A key growth driver this quarter was the ramp-up of Coforge’s $1.6 billion contract with Sabre, which powered a 31 percent sequential surge in its travel, transportation, and hospitality vertical. This helped offset weakness in its BFSI segment, where banking revenue slipped 1.1 percent and insurance saw a modest 1 percent uptick in US dollar terms. The company’s rupee revenue rose 8.6 percent sequentially to Rs 3,687 crore. On the margin front, EBITDA improved by 60 basis points to 17.5 percent, while EBIT margin held steady at 13.2 percent. Coforge secured new deals worth $507 million during the quarter. While this is significantly lower than the $2.1 billion haul in the previous quarter, the earlier number included the mega Sabre deal. Importantly, the executable order book for the next 12 months now stands at $1.54 billion—up 3 percent sequentially and a robust 44 percent year-on-year. At about 1:40 am, shares of the company were trading at Rs 1,614, lower by 5.2 percent from the last close on the NSE. Coforge shares are down over 16 percent since the beginning of the year.

EBITDA increased by ~24% YoY/QoQ to INR4.0b (~11% miss), and EBITDA/t increased ~32% YoY to INR966 (est. INR995). PAT increased ~142% YoY to INR860m (~27% below our estimates). The management indicated cement sales volume declined ~7% YoY due to weak demand led by the early monsoon in Kerala and eastern markets. While the construction chemical business posted a strong growth of 79% YoY, albeit on a low base. It reiterated the capacity target of 30mtpa to be achieved by Mar’26 with the commissioning of line-2 and debottlenecking of existing capacity at the Kurnool plant and adding grinding capacities in existing plants with nominal capex. TRCL has monetized INR5.0b so far, through sales of non-core assets out of the targeted INR10.0b. The balance is likely to be monetized before Sep’25 vs. earlier expectations of by Jul’25, a slight delay due to pending approvals. Outlook The stock is currently trading at 17x/15x FY26E/FY27E EV/EBITDA (vs. its long-term average of 15x) and USD140/USD120 EV/t (vs. long-term average of USD130).

Notably, upcoming introductions such as g-Entresto have the potential to further strengthen growth in the US generics segment. That said, a broader scope of business would be necessary to enhance capacity utilization and, in turn, improve the profitability of the US generics segment.

The company is on track to commercialize greenfield expansions at Bengaluru markets by Q2FY26.

BHEL reported a dismal quarter with a flattish revenue of Rs54.9bn and an EBITDA level loss of Rs5.4bn due to sharp increase in other expenses. Continued execution challenges in the Power segment led to 5.6% YoY decline in revenue despite a strong power order book of ~Rs1.6trn. Macro tailwinds—public/private capex and policy support— continue to drive robust order inflows, including ~14.6 GW of thermal orders won in FY25 and a Rs65bn equipment order won from Adani Power during the quarter. BHEL’s active diversification into transmission, transportation, defense, and Oil & Gas is yielding results with award of the prestigious 6 GW Bhadla-Fatehpur HVDC order to the consortium of the company during Q1, further bolstering its presence in the industrial segment. While near-term challenges persist in execution and profitability, the strong order pipeline and strategic shift toward non-power segments position BHEL for long-term back ended growth.

This came after the company reported a 103 percent on-year surge in net profit to Rs 539 crore for the April-June quarter of the financial year 2026. The stock exchange released its results for Q1 FY26 in the post market hours of August 8. While net profit more than doubled on an annual basis, it grew 9 percent sequentially from the Rs 494 crore reported in the previous quarter. Revenue from operations meanwhile increased 59 percent on-year and 13 percent sequentially to Rs 958 crore in Q1 FY26. BSE's EBITDA rose 105% to Rs 704 crore in Q1FY26 as compared to Rs 344 crore a year ago. Should you buy, sell or hold? Motilal Oswal Financial Services kept a 'neutral' rating on the stock, but increased its target price to Rs 2,600 apiece. This implies an upside potential of nearly 6.5 percent from the stock’s previous closing price of Rs 2,442 apiece. The domestic brokerage said that the firm’s Q1 net profit beat its estimates by 13 percent, driven by lower-than-expected clearing house expenses. Motilal Oswal increased its earnings estimates for BSE by 7 percent each for FY26 and FY27, in order to adjust for lower clearing house costs and income from colocation. It however kept the ‘neutral’ rating, anticipating a market share loss from the shift in expiry from September 2025 and uncertainty over future regulatory actions. ""We expect BSE to lose 300-400bp of premium turnover market share once the weekly expiry shifts to Thursday from Tuesday currently. Any further regulatory moves to curb retail activity in F&O can impact volumes for the exchange,"" it said. Jefferies kept a 'Hold' rating for BSE shares, but reduced its target price to Rs 2,790 apiece. The international brokerage said that the firm’s Q1 profit was in line with estimate, buy revenue growth missed expectations slightly, according to CNBC-TV18. Jefferies trimmed its EPS estimates by 5-6 percent, to account for lower options activity. Goldman Sachs maintained a 'Neutral' rating on the stock, with a price target of Rs 2,550 per share. This implies an upside potential of more than 4 percent from the stock’s previous closing price of Rs 2,442 apiece.

VIP IN reported weak set of results with topline declining 12.1% YoY to Rs5,614mn (PLe Rs6,325mn) as volumes were down by 8% amid weak growth in e-com channel. Adjusting for inventory provision of ~Rs150mn and one-off expense of ~Rs110mn, EBITDA margin stood at 9.0% (PLe 9.8%). We believe FY26E will be a year of cost reset and reorganization for VIP IN amid change of guard at top-level. We expect normalization to resume from FY27E with steady state GM/EBITDA margin of 51.5%/15.4% respectively.

Tata Motors extends losing streak to third day ahead of Q1 earnings,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/tata-motors-extends-losing-streak-to-third-day-ahead-of-q1-earnings-13421965.html,"Shares of Tata Motors slipped over a percent to Rs 639, marking its third straight day of losses, as investors turned cautious ahead of the automaker’s Q1 results later today, with analysts bracing for a sharp decline in profit and revenue. According to a Moneycontrol poll of six brokerage firms, the Nexon maker is anticipated to record an 8.7 percent year-on-year decrease in revenue, reaching Rs 98,600 crore. Net profit is projected to witness a massive plunge of about 33.5 percent to Rs 3,672 crore from Rs 5,523 crore in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates The domestic revenue is expected to take a hit due to a sharp 6 percent decrease in volumes and a flat average selling price year-on-year. The company sold 85,206 vehicles during the quarter, lower than the 91,209 units sold in the same quarter of the previous year. The company’s British arm, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), is expected to report a 12 percent year-on-year decline in volumes for the first quarter of FY26, excluding the China joint venture. The drop is largely attributed to subdued demand in the US market, where the imposition of Trump-era tariffs has dampened buyer sentiment. Consolidated margins are expected to decline year-on-year by about 390 basis points. This decline will likely be driven by a combination of factors: negative operating leverage due to lower volumes, increased tariff-related costs on US sales, and adverse foreign exchange impact arising from the appreciation of the British pound against the US dollar. Also read: REITs push for bank loan access, cite parity with InvITs but govt split on proposal Investors will watch for updates on JLR’s FY26 guidance, progress on cost-control initiatives, demand and discounting trends in key markets, as well as volume and market-share trajectory. Clarity on the new-model launch schedule and the phase-out plan for Jaguar models will also be key. At about 12:10 pm, shares of the company were trading at Rs 741, lower by 0.75 percent from the last close on the NSE. Tata Motors' share price has slipped nearly 13 percent since the beginning of the year.

Unlisted shares of MSEI plunge as revival optimism fades away; price drops 65% since December,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/unlisted-shares-of-msei-plunge-as-revival-optimism-fades-away-price-drops-65-since-december-13421544.html,"Shares of Metropolitan Stock Exchange of India (MSEI) have seen a huge 65 percent fall in the current calendar year in the unlisted segment as optimism around its revival faded away with stricter rules put in place in the equity derivatives segment. Data from Unlisted Zone shows that the MSEI shares are currently hovering a little below Rs 5, plunging nearly 14 percent in the last 15 days. More importantly, the shares have dropped nearly 65 percent since December – falling from Rs 14 to the current levels. According to experts, the sentiments around MSEI turned bleak after the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) directed that only two days – Tuesday and Thursday – can be fixed as expiry days for the derivative contracts. This was after the regulator said that only one weekly expiry contracts would be allowed per exchange. This assumes significance as there was a lot of traction in the shares of MSEI when new norms were announced for the F&O segment. It was believed that MSEI would be able to launch a weekly expiry contract with an expiry day different from that of NSE or BSE, which would help the exchange attract significant trading volumes. However, the SEBI diktat on only two days permitted for expiry dashed investor sentiments. “The initial rally in MSEI’s share price was driven by investor optimism that the exchange would be allowed to launch weekly F&O contracts with an expiry date different from those of NSE and BSE. However, the recent SEBI regulation restricting this possibility dampened sentiment, leading to a correction in the stock,” says Umesh Paliwal, co-founder, Unlisted Zone. “Subsequently, news emerged about MSEI’s plans to raise additional capital and expand into new segments. While these developments signal growth intentions, the real test lies in the exchange’s ability to successfully roll out competitive products -- such as offerings in the cash market or bond market, and generate meaningful revenue. With the exchange space being intensely competitive, the coming 6–8 months will be crucial for MSEI. These uncertainties have collectively contributed to the recent decline in its share price,” adds Paliwal. Last month, the board of the exchange approved a decision to raise as much as Rs 1,000 crore and further said that the proposed allottees would include Peak XV Venture Partners Investments VII, Share India Securities, Trust Investment Advisors, Marwadi Chandarana Intermediaries Brokers, and Monarch Networth Capital among others. This was following an earlier board meeting in December when the exchange approved raising nearly Rs 240 crore from marquee names like Billionbrains Garage Ventures (promoter entity of Groww), and Rainmatter Investments (Kamath brothers of Zerodha), along with Securicorp Securities India, and Share India Securities. Meanwhile, in an emailed response, MSEI said that there is huge potential in this country for more than two stock exchanges to operate and survive as we are a growing economy. ""We are truly humbled and encouraged by the market’s positive response to our recent initiatives — including two successful rounds of fundraising and the growing interest from market participants.We shall soon be relaunching equity segment followed by other segments. Further, we will continue to introduce new initiatives, along with niche products and services to meet the evolving needs of the market,"" it said."
Buy Jyoti Resins and Adhesives; target of Rs 1764: CD Equisearch,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-jyoti-resins-and-adhesives-target-of-rs-1764-cd-equisearch-13421651.html,"CD Equisearch's research report on Jyoti Resins and Adhesives Jyoti Resins & Adhesives is one of the leading manufacturers of white glue adhesives in the Indian retail market. It operates in the brand name of ‘Euro 7000’ which it launched in 2006 and has currently presence in 14 Indian states. Increasing Government support through projects like ‘Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana’ under the scheme ‘Housing for All’ and projects related to promote smart cities have bolstered demand for woodworking in India in the past few years. Consumers’ inclination towards high quality and appealing wooden aesthetics have also helped accelerate growth in wood adhesives market. Rising demand for both commercial and residential projects (supported by growing urbanization) too has buoyed demand for wood adhesives. Outlook Balancing odds, we assign a ‘buy’ rating on the stock with a target of Rs 1764 based on 22x FY27e earnings, over a period of 9-12 months.

Buy Anant Raj; target of Rs 800: Emkay Global Financial,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-anant-raj-target-of-rs-800-emkay-global-financial-13421648.html,"Emkay Global Financial' research report on Anant Raj We expect operations to start over the next 3-4 months, with annualized occupancy at ~70%, which would improve ahead. This would take the total operational DC capacity to 28MW (including 0.5MW of cloud capacity), from 6MW currently. Over the next two years, we expect DC capacity to increase to 63MW at a capex ~Rs19-20bn, which would largely be met through cash flow generated from the real estate business. The management expects DC business revenue of Rs12bn by FY27 and Rs90bn by FY32, at full occupancy. We have factored in gradual improvement in occupancy and, hence, expect DC business revenue to increase to Rs7bn in FY27E, from Rs455mn in FY25. Overall, we expect ~20% IRR for the DC business by FY45E. Accordingly, despite the delayed fundraising, expansion via internal accruals will keep the net debt low at Rs2.1bn till FY27E (currently Rs1.2bn), in our view. Outlook We reiterate BUY on Anant Raj, with an unchanged TP of Rs800. We visited the company’s new data center facilities in Panchkula (7MW capacity) and Manesar (21MW), in Haryana.

Buy Lupin; target of Rs 2500: Emkay Global Financial,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-lupin-target-of-rs-2500-emkay-global-financial-13421763.html,"Emkay Global Financial' research report on Lupin Lupin delivered yet another quarter of earnings outperformance vs street as well as our estimates, with the beat in 1QFY26 being driven by a higher gross margin. Gross margin as well as EBITDA margin were at multi-quarter highs, with the higher gross margins likely to sustain in 2Q+3Q on the back of exclusivity in gJynarque. 1Q performance reinforces our long-held view that FY26 margins for Lupin will be closer to 26%. We note that our FY27/28 US estimates already factor in incremental competition in gProAir (FY27) and gSpiriva (FY28) and, given Lupin’s/peers’ past as well as recent experiences with inhaler filings, Lupin’s core US profit pool could stay preserved for longer. In addition to the upbeat management commentary (the delay in gDulera launch being a minor negative), our continued positive stance stems from 1) our belief that gJynarque will remain a meaningful contributor to earnings well into FY27, 2) the company being in the middle of a balance sheet strengthening cycle, and 3) Lupin’s sustained R&D investments in complex generics which will continue to feed into its medium-term US pipeline. Besides, the company’s established domestic diabetes franchise benefiting from therapy-specific tailwinds and the likely elimination of margin drag from domestic adjacencies remain potential upside drivers. Outlook We marginally raise our earnings estimates and roll forward to Jun-27E EPS; retain BUY and TP of Rs2,500.

Reduce Britannia Industries; target of Rs 5500: Emkay Global Financial,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/reduce-britannia-industries-target-of-rs-5500-emkay-global-financial-2-13421634.html,"Emkay Global Financial' research report on Britannia Industries Q1 results were in line, adjusting for the Phantom Stock Option Scheme expenses. Under this scheme, employees are being incentivized with a Rs520mn payout, based on 19% stock price return. We believe this arrangement could weigh on near-term performance, as any stock price appreciation from strong execution will be rewarded back to the management, impacting reported financials. The management aims to offset the impact from next year. We find the recent actions to be accretive, ie: a) a sharper focus on health and indulgence through new launches; b) faster growth in Quick Commerce (now 3% of sales; 500bps higher market share), and c) healthy price hikes, along with expected RM stability. Our double-digit earnings growth forecast for FY26E remains intact, even after the 5% earnings cut. As the stock appears to be fairly valued, the employee cost impact from the scheme seems immaterial. Outlook We maintain REDUCE, lowering our Jun-26E TP by 6% to Rs5,500, based on 48x P/E (revised from 50x, now aligned with the 5Y average forward P/E).

Brokerages were quick to turn optimistic. CLSA maintained an “outperform” rating with a target price of Rs 4,394 per share, noting its confidence in management’s jewellery EBIT margin guidance of 11 to 11.5 percent for FY26. Jefferies retained a “buy” rating and lifted its target price to Rs 3,800 per share, citing robust growth in both jewellery and watches, along with healthy margin expansion in the June quarter. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog Prabhudas Lilladher also maintained its “buy” call, setting a target price of Rs 3,901 per share. The brokerage remains upbeat on the company’s long-term outlook, pointing to its efforts to enhance product mix, the strategic shift towards lightweight jewellery, and a strong medium-term growth runway led by innovative designs. Citi, however, struck a more cautious tone, assigning a “neutral” rating with a target price of Rs 3,900 per share. While acknowledging Titan’s near-term growth potential relative to other discretionary categories, the brokerage flagged medium-term margin risks from intense competition, high gold prices, and an unfavourable product mix. In Q1FY26, Titan’s consolidated net profit surged 52.5 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,091 crore, while revenue jumped 24.6 percent to Rs 16,523 crore. Operating profit (EBITDA) rose 46.7 percent to Rs 1,830 crore from Rs 1,247 crore a year earlier. EBITDA margin improved to 11.1 percent from 9.4 percent, surpassing expectations of 10.6 percent. The jewellery division, Titan’s biggest revenue generator, posted a 19 percent year-on-year growth (excluding bullion and digi-gold sales) despite persistently high gold prices. The watches and wearables segment logged one of its best quarters ever, with revenue up 24 percent to Rs 1,273 crore. The EyeCare business grew 13 percent year-on-year to Rs 238 crore, delivering an EBIT of Rs 20 crore with an 8.4 percent margin. Meanwhile, Titan Engineering & Automation reported a 56 percent jump in income to Rs 307 crore. Within this, Automation Solutions grew 82 percent, while Manufacturing Services expanded 16 percent, buoyed by strong demand from the aerospace sector.

Neutral Bajaj Auto; target of Rs 8561: LKP Research,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/neutral-bajaj-auto-target-of-rs-8561-lkp-research-13421305.html,"LKP Research's research report on Bajaj Auto Bajaj Auto (BAL) reported muted Q1FY26 results. Revenue came in at ₹120.8 bn, registering growth of 4.6% YoY and 3.3% QoQ. Domestic performance remained subdued, primarily due to (1) the early and intense onset of the monsoon, (2) elevated inflation in metro cities, (3) purchase deferments by customers, and (4) heightened competitive intensity. However, strong export performance helped offset the domestic weakness, with export volumes witnessing robust growth and premium bike sales reaching an all-time high in international markets. EBITDA margin stood at 19.7% in Q1FY26, down 53 bps YoY and 20 bps QoQ. The decline was driven by an unfavourable currency environment in key export geographies, rising commodity costs, and supply chain disruptions related to rare earth magnets. These challenges impacted production of the Chetak EV and EV 3Ws. The company reported PBT of ₹27.9 bn, with PBT margin improving by 37 bps YoY to 23%, supported by higher other income and lower finance costs. Looking ahead, we expect BAL to face near-term margin pressure due to intensifying competition in the +125cc segment and continued supply constraints stemming from the rare earth magnet shortage. Outlook We estimate revenue/EBITDA/PBT to grow at a CAGR of 9%/9%/8% over FY25–27E and value the stock at 25x FY27E EPS, arriving at a target price of ₹8,561.

Quarterly revenues have grown at a 27% CAGR over the last two years, supported by capacity expansion and global demand. Gross margin declined to 32.6% due to mix change and coffee price volatility, though gross profit still rose 17% YoY. Its EBITDA rose 22% YoY to ₹1.59 bn, but PAT was flat YoY and down 29% QoQ due to peak depreciation and interest costs, both expected to ease from Q3. Branded and domestic businesses remained strong, with 20% YoY growth and improved margins; management reaffirmed 10–20% volume and 15–20% EBITDA growth guidance for FY26. Net debt declined to ₹16.7 bn, with working capital likely to ease as coffee prices stabilize; depreciation and interest burden are expected to gradually reduce. Outlook We revise our rating to ‘NEUTRAL’ with a target price of ₹938, as near-term positives appear priced in; we estimate 22%/19%/22% CAGR in Revenue/EBITDA/PAT over FY24–27.

Kalyan Jewellers sharply lower by over 7 percent on heavy volumes despite strong Q1 earnings,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/kalyan-jewellers-sharply-lower-by-over-7-percent-on-heavy-volumes-despite-strong-q1-earnings-13421276.html,"Shares of Kalyan Jewellers are sharply lower in the trading session on August 8, down over 7 percent with volumes that are nearly three times the one-month average, despite a healthy June quarter result. On August 7, Kalyan reported a net profit of Rs 264 crore for the June quarter, up 49 percent on year, with revenue from operations higher by 31 percent at Rs 7,268.48 crore. The Q1FY26 EBITDA was higher by 38 percent on year at Rs 508 crore. Ramesh Kalyanaraman, ED, Kalyan Jewellers told CNBC-TV18 during an interaction that the Same Store Sales Growth has been 'very strong' in the range of 18 percent, maintaining the double-digit growth trend of past 6-8 quarters, and there are no triggers that would change this drastically. Going forward, the jeweller is hoping to benefit from more number of festive days in the ongoing Q2FY26. The jeweller also said it has reduced bank loans by Rs 500 crore so far. Rising Share of Organised Players The organised retail market share in the jewellery business has been consistently rising from 32 percent in 2020 to 40 percent this year, with high demand and ownership in the rural India. Kalyan said it is sitting with a 7 percent share in the organised pie, and its strong brand and scalable model positions it well to capitalise on the opportunity arising from the shift towards organised jewellery. The jeweller is expanding largely via a capital-light franchise store strategy. Kalayn also said it plans to launch new regional brands offering exclusively localised designs. On a YTD basis, the shares are down nearly 29 percent but are flat over last one year. Another leading company from the same space, Titan Company, has said that it is exploring 14 and 18-carat jewellery options in order to offer more affordable pricing for customers. Street View Motilal Oswal said in a note that with the successful ramp up of the new franchise businesses - which add 40 percent to the revenue - along with continued success in non-Southern markets, Kalyan has emerged as a leading brand, assigning a target price of Rs 1800 per share with a Buy call. Tariff Jitters The gems and jewellery space has also had to contend with the additional levy by US President Trump, which could make US exports unattractive for the sector as a whole. Trade think tank GTRI has said in a note that the India's export segments can be grouped in three categories - very high impact (exports hit of 50-70 percent), high-impact (30-50 percent hit), and low or no impact areas. Among the nine products in the very high impact category, diamonds, gold and jewellery are one of them. Gems and jewellery exporters' association GJEPC has urged the government for policy reforms to support the industry. America is the largest market for Indian gems and jewellery, accounting for over $10 billion in exports, which accounts for nearly 30 percent of the industry's total global trade, Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) chairman Kirit Bhansali has said. In an interaction with Bloomberg TV, TK Ramesh, the ED of Kalyan Jeweller said it plans to expand its Dubai manufacturing unit, potentially a move to offset any tariff-related setback. Impact of High Gold Prices Another leading company from the same space, Titan Company, has said that it is exploring 14 and 18-carat jewellery options in order to offer more affordable pricing for customers. In a separate development, the Financial Times has reported that the US has put tariffs on imports of one-kilogram gold bars, a move that could add volatility to the global bullion market, and is a setback for the precious metals business out of Switzerland, following which gold futures in New York have surged to a record high."

"NSDL rally continues: Shares surge 19% on Day 3, extend post-listing gains to 52%; m-cap rises to Rs 26,000 cr",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/nsdl-rally-continues-shares-surge-16-on-day-3-extend-post-listing-gains-to-48-m-cap-rises-to-rs-25-000-cr-13421289.html,"The shares of National Securities Depository (NSDL) gained nearly 19 percent on August 8, extending massive gains for the third consecutive session since market debut. The shares of the company are now more than 68 percent higher than the IPO price. The shares have now gained nearly 52 percent in the three sessions since their market debut. The market capitalization of the company surged significantly in the first three days to cross Rs 26,000-mark. The shares of NSDL had made a decent stock market debut on August 6, listing at Rs 880 apiece on BSE. This marked a premium of 10 percent over its IPO price at Rs 880 apiece. The listing premium was lower than grey market estimates. Ahead of listing, the unlisted shares of the company were trading with a grey market premium of nearly 16 percent over the IPO price. According to analysts, investors should consider holding the stock for the long term, given NSDL’s strong fundamentals and leadership in the depository segment. NSDL’s P/E ratio currently stands at around 77, higher than that of peer CDSL whose P/E ratio currently stands at around 66. ""NSDL’s post-listing performance has been nothing short of remarkable, with the stock rallying over 48% in just three sessions and market capitalisation crossing ₹25,000 crore. This surge underscores the market’s conviction in NSDL’s entrenched position within India’s capital market infrastructure. As one of only two depositories operating in a near-duopoly alongside CDSL, NSDL enjoys strong pricing power, high entry barriers, and a dominant share in value-based transactions and institutional account holdings,"" said Bhavik Joshi, Business Head, INVasset PMS. He noted that the stock's current P/E multiple of around 77 may appear stretched when compared to CDSL’s 66, but investors are clearly willing to pay a premium for its scale, technology backbone, and long-standing trust within the ecosystem. ""That said, prospective investors should be mindful of certain structural risks — dependence on transaction volumes, evolving investor participation patterns, and the ever-present cybersecurity and regulatory compliance requirements. In the near term, valuations may moderate if market activity slows, offering potential entry points for those who missed the IPO,"" he added. Siddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director of Vibhavangal Anukulakara Private Limited, meanwhile said, ""NSDL's strong post-listing rally...demonstrates strong investor belief in its market infrastructure position. As a core institution in India's financial system, NSDL's strong fundamentals and leadership position are obviously striking a chord with institutional and retail investors alike.""

"Bharti Airtel shares fall over 2 percent on large trade of equity worth over Rs 12,500 crore",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/bharti-airtel-shares-fall-over-2-percent-on-large-trade-of-equity-worth-over-rs-12-500-crore-13421194.html,"Shares of Bharti Airtel are lower by over 2 percent in early trade on August 8, emerging as the top loser on Nifty 50 index following a large trade that saw nearly one percent of the company's equity change hands, worth Rs 12,563 crore. Moneycontrol had reported a day before that Sunil Mittal-led promoter entity is looking at a part stake sale in the telecom major. ""The transaction has been launched at a floor price of Rs 1,862 per share, which is at a 3.15% discount to the last closing price,"" one of the persons familiar with the development had said. Indian Continent Investment, a Sunil Mittal-led promoter group entity that has likely trimmed its stake, holds 2.47% stake in Bharti Airtel. After the June quarter earnings, Morgan Stanley had maintained its 'equal-weight' on Airtel, with a price target of Rs 1,890 per share. CLSA had kept its 'outperform' rating with a target price of Rs 2,035 per share. Macquarie, too, had maintained 'outperform' rating with a price target of Rs 2,050 per share after the Q1FY26 results. Read More Bharti Airtel posted a robust free cashflow of Rs 14,500 crore and managed to trim net debt by Rs 13,000 crore sequentially to Rs 1.26 lakh crore in the June quarter. The telecom company is ramping up its fiber rollout from 1.6 million to 2.5 million home pass-ups per quarter, and is treating both FTTH and FWA under a single WiFi strategy. Airtel's ARPU rose to Rs 250, helped by a better subscriber mix and an extra day in the quarter. Airtel's digital network across India and Africa now serve over 60 crore customers. ""Africa reported solid performance with 6.7% growth in constant currency. India Mobile business recorded a sequential growth of 2.9%, driven by continued focus on portfolio premiumization..."", Gopal Vittal, Vice Chairman and MD of Bharti Airtel had said after the earnings. Over the last five years, Airtel has invested over Rs 1.6 trillion in expanding its digital infrastructure, and the company has said in the past that the capex will trend down in FY26, with a large part of the heavy lifting largely done. The data center capex is part of the overall capex to be incurred by the company and is on track with previous guidance of around Rs 5,000 crore spread over three years."
"Nifty, Sensex to see muted start as tariff pressures weigh; key levels to watch on August 8",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/nifty-sensex-to-see-muted-start-as-tariff-pressures-weigh-key-levels-to-watch-in-august-8-13420017.html,"Equity benchmarks Nifty 50 and Sensex could open mildly in the red on Friday, August 8, as President Donald Trump decision to double tariffs on Indian goods to 50 percent could pressure the bulls. At 7.30 am, the GIFT Nifty index was trading lower by 0.2 percent or 50 points at 24,644. In the previous session, Nifty 50 and Sensex staged a smart recovery in the last hour of trade, erasing sharp intraday losses, to eke out minor gains as possibilities of talks between U.S. and Russia lifted sentiment. Earlier in the session, the market took a sharp fall as U.S. President Donald Trump announced an additional 25 percent tariff on Indian goods, taking the total tariff rate to 50 percent. Trump's move comes in response to New Delhi’s continued purchases of Russian oil and defence equipment. After the order, the total tariff on Indian goods, barring a small exemption list, will be 50 percent. Here are the key levels to watch out for in today's session Yesterday's intraday pullback and strong close indicate possible short-term momentum building up for the sessions ahead, as concerns over tariff impositions failed to dent overall market sentiment. The 24,500 level continues to act as a pivotal support zone, reflecting resilience among buyers. Immediate support lies at 24,450, aligning with a previous demand zone. Unless breached decisively, any dip is likely to attract fresh buying interest. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart hovers around 40 but has started showing a positive divergence, hinting at easing bearish momentum. Intraday indicators also signal a reversal from oversold territory. ""The overall structure remains oversold, suggesting that any pullbacks may offer opportunities to initiate fresh long positions as optimism gradually returns,"" said Dhupesh Dhameja, Derivatives Research Analyst, SAMCO Securities. India VIX edged lower by 2.28 percent, closing at 11.68. Despite global tariff-related developments, implied volatility remains subdued and anchored near neutral territory. The persistent low VIX suggests the broader market is expecting consolidation rather than sharp downside risks, indicating that caution exists without panic.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade TVS Motor, BSE, Aditya Birla Capital, Cholamandalam Financial, Delhivery, Eternal and others on August 8?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-tvs-motor-bse-aditya-birla-capital-cholamandalam-financial-delhivery-eternal-and-others-on-august-8-13419723.html,"Equity benchmark indices recouped all losses and turned green in late trade, with the Nifty 50 rising 22 points on August 7. However, the market breadth remained favourable for bears, with about 1,478 shares under pressure against 1,205 rising shares on the NSE. The sustainability of Thursday's recovery is the key to watch, as frontline indices remained well below short-term moving averages. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Jay Mehta, Technical Research at JM Financial Services Ambuja Cements | CMP: 592.35  Ambuja achieved a breakout above a triangular pattern on June 27 and is now holding support near the 50EMA, retesting prior horizontal resistance levels after the breakout. A minor hurdle lies at Rs 606; breaking above this could target Rs 630 and Rs 650. A stop-loss is recommended at Rs 577. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 630, Rs 650 Stop-Loss: Rs 577 TVS Motor Company | CMP: Rs 3,013.4  TVS Motor achieved a strong breakout above a resistance level that had been in place since September 2024. This level was tested on June 27, 2025, but the stock was unable to break above it until August 5, when it finally did so with robust positive volume. Support is at Rs 2,720 (buy on dips till Rs 2,700). Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,440, Rs 3,700 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,600 Reliance Industries | CMP: Rs 1,389.4  Reliance is near its critical 200EMA support and the horizontal support level from the May 9, 2025 low, forming a dragonfly doji at this level—signaling a potential bullish reversal. The MACD histogram is rising, hinting at a possible positive crossover in upcoming sessions. There has also been a positive volume increase over the last two sessions. A small resistance lies at Rs 1,420; a break above this could target Rs 1,470 and Rs 1,500. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,470, Rs 1,500 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,350 Mandar Bhojane, Senior Equity Research Analyst at Choice Broking BSE | CMP: Rs 2,442.2  BSE is currently exhibiting a strong bullish setup, with technical signals aligning across multiple timeframes. On the daily chart, the stock is forming a Descending Triangle pattern, which typically indicates accumulation and a decline in selling pressure. A decisive close above Rs 2,450, accompanied by strong volumes, would confirm a breakout and could trigger a sharp upward rally. The stock is trading well above its 100-day and 200-day EMAs, reflecting sustained strength across medium- and long-term time horizons. The RSI stands at 45.47 and is gradually rising, suggesting growing buying interest without entering overbought territory. Additionally, momentum remains favourable, supported by a positive MACD crossover, which further validates the bullish structure. Traders may adopt a 'buy-on-dips' strategy near Rs 2,370, with a stop-loss at Rs 2,280. Upon a confirmed breakout above Rs 2,450, the stock has the potential to rally towards Rs 2,750 and Rs 2,800. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,750, Rs 2,800 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,280 Aditya Birla Capital | CMP: Rs 278.15  Aditya Birla Capital is consolidating just above a key breakout zone, indicating underlying strength. On the weekly chart, the stock has recently broken out from a Cup and Handle pattern—a classic bullish reversal setup. Rising volumes during the consolidation phase highlight growing investor participation, increasing the likelihood of a sustained upside breakout. A decisive close above Rs 280 would validate the pattern breakout and could trigger strong bullish momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 71.4 and trending upward, indicating robust momentum with room for further upside. On the downside, Rs 265 acts as immediate support, offering an ideal buy-on-dips opportunity for positional traders. If the breakout sustains with continued buying interest, the stock could potentially rally towards Rs 320 and Rs 350. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 320, Rs 350 Stop-Loss: Rs 260 Cholamandalam Financial Holdings | CMP: Rs 1,849.1  Cholamandalam Financial Holdings has recently reversed from a strong demand zone near the 200EMA, forming a Morning Star candlestick pattern on the daily chart. This bullish reversal pattern, coupled with rising volumes, signals renewed buying interest and suggests a potential trend reversal in favour of the bulls. From a momentum standpoint, the RSI is at 36.39 and trending upward, also exhibiting a bullish divergence—further strengthening the case for a positive move ahead. On the downside, Rs 1,800 acts as a strong support level, making it a key accumulation zone for traders looking to enter on dips. If the stock sustains above current levels with continued volume participation, it could rally towards the short-term target of Rs 2,035. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,035 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,760 Om Mehra, Technical Research Analyst at Samco Securities Procter & Gamble Health | CMP: Rs 6,313  Procter & Gamble Health extended its breakout move above the neckline of a well-defined Cup and Handle pattern on the daily chart. The breakout above the Rs 6,200–Rs 6,250 zone was accompanied by a noticeable surge in volume, confirming strong participation and validating the bullish continuation pattern. The price is now trading well above all key moving averages, including the 9-day, 20-day, and 50-day SMAs. The rounded base formation found strong support near Rs 5,800, with the handle consolidating tightly just below the neckline. This classic setup resolved with a clean breakout, and the subsequent retest of the neckline has been absorbed well. The RSI has remained steady at 70, and its upward slope may continue in the coming sessions. The MACD is in a strong bullish crossover, with the histogram expanding positively and the fast line accelerating away from the signal line—reinforcing the strength behind the breakout. The earlier resistance near Rs 6,100 now acts as immediate support, and any short-term pullback toward this zone may offer a buying opportunity. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 6,800 Stop-Loss: Rs 6,090 Delhivery | CMP: Rs 465.75  Delhivery surged 8.35% in the current week, registering its strongest weekly performance in recent months and confirming a breakout from a long consolidation band. The stock decisively crossed above the Rs 440–450 supply zone, a level that had consistently capped upside over the past several quarters—marking a trend reversal on the higher time frame. The rally has been backed by expanding volume, with the stock now trading significantly above both the 20-week and 50-week SMAs. The RSI has entered overbought territory at 76, reflecting robust momentum, although it remains stable with no signs of divergence. The MACD has been in a bullish crossover for several weeks and continues to expand positively. The breakout zone near Rs 451 now acts as immediate support on any minor pullback. The broader structure suggests that the uptrend may continue, with any dip offering re-entry opportunities. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 510. Stop-Loss: Rs 445 Eternal | CMP: Rs 301.75  Eternal is attempting to stabilize after breaking out from a rising channel earlier this month. The breakout occurred with strong bullish momentum and volume expansion, lifting the stock decisively above the Rs 290 mark. The stock has entered a healthy retest phase and is now hovering just above the rising trendline. This retest aligns with the 20-day SMA at Rs 290, which has started acting as dynamic support. The long lower wick of recent candles suggests that dips are being absorbed—indicating a possible continuation if support holds. The RSI currently stands at 63, cooling off from the overbought zone while maintaining a positive slope above the 60 level. This indicates sustained momentum without signs of divergence. Meanwhile, the MACD remains positively skewed. The volume trends remain supportive, with higher accumulation visible on breakout days. The Rs 295 zone now serves as a critical support base, and any further dips into this zone may provide renewed buying interest.

Biocon posts Rs 31 crore net profit in Q1FY26,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/biocon-posts-rs-31-crore-net-profit-in-q1fy26-13418799.html,"Biocon net profit before exceptional items rose 342% year-on-year to Rs 31 crore on a like-for-like basis for the first quarter of FY26, driven by robust growth in its biosimilars business and improved operating leverage across segments. The company had a one-time benefit of Rs 1,057 crore in Q1 last year due to divestment of its India branded formulation units. Operating revenue grew 15% YoY to Rs 3,942 crore, with EBITDA rising 19% to Rs 829 crore. Core EBITDA stood at Rs 1,003 crore, with margins at 25%. The company spent Rs 205 crore net R&D or 7% of revenue, ex-Syngene. “Our biosimilars and CRDMO businesses continued to deliver strong momentum, while generics held steady,” said Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, Chairperson of Biocon Group. “The recent QIP has strengthened our balance sheet and enables us to increase our ownership in Biocon Biologics.” Biosimilars revenue, which constitutes 61% of revenues, rose 18% YoY to Rs 2,458 crore, with EBITDA up 36% to Rs 645 crore and margins stood at 26% on like-to-like basis. The company launched Yesafili in Canada and received USFDA approval for Kirsty, its second interchangeable biosimilar insulin. Generics revenue grew 6% YoY to Rs 697 crore, driven by new launches including Liraglutide in the EU and Dasatinib in the US. CRDMO (Syngene) revenue rose 11% YoY to Rs 875 crore, with EBITDA up 19% to Rs 224 crore, supported by long-term contract conversions and expanded scientific capabilities. Biocon raised Rs 4,500 crore via a Qualified Institutions Placement (QIP) in June to consolidate its stake in Biocon Biologics and facilitate investor exits. The company also commissioned a new GLP-1-focused injectable facility in Bangalore, with commercialization expected in FY27. With 19 global launches and 12 biosimilars already commercialized, Biocon is expanding its footprint in advanced and emerging markets. “We are confident in our ability to scale, deepen market presence, and deliver sustained growth,” said Shreehas Tambe, CEO of Biocon Biologics."
Eris Lifesciences eyes Novo Nordisk’s exit to expand human insulin play in India,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/eris-lifesciences-eyes-novo-nordisk-s-exit-to-expand-human-insulin-play-in-india-13418283.html,"Eris Lifesciences is positioning itself to capture a significant share of India’s human insulin market following Novo Nordisk’s exit from the pen cartridge segment. The Ahmedabad-based drugmaker, which acquired Biocon’s insulin portfolio, is now working to bring insulin manufacturing in-house—a plan that has faced regulatory delays but remains central to its long-term strategy. “We expect this opportunity to start playing out from November–December,” said V. Krishnakumar, Executive Director and COO of Eris. “This financial year we’ll probably get four to five months of revenue, but the full-year impact will be seen in FY27,” Krishnakumar said. Eris competes against Lupin and Wockhardt in human insulin segment. According to market research firm IMARC Group, the Indian insulin market was valued at $635.70 million in 2024 and is growing at 3.9% annually.. Eris currently sources human insulin from both Biocon and MJ Biopharm, with plans to internalize formulation manufacturing by year-end. The company has also made its first foray into drug substance manufacturing through an investment in Levim Lifetech, which is developing recombinant products including weight loss and anti-diabetes GLP-1 drug semaglutide. Eris last year acquired a 30% stake in Levim for ₹54 crore, valuing the latter at ₹180 crore. This investment is part of Eris's strategy to expand its biotechnology footprint, particularly in areas like biologics. Gearing up for ""day-one"" Semaglutide launch in India Eris is preparing for a “day-one” launch of semaglutide in India once the patent expires in March 2026. “Everything looks to be in good shape,” Krishnakumar said. The company is validating cartridges at its Swiss Parenterals unit and expects to begin in-house production of the drug product later this year. The move builds on Eris’ growing injectable platform and its September 2024 launch of liraglutide, which has already crossed ₹7 crore in quarterly sales. “The fact that we have a very strong insulin platform gives us a significant tailwind in selling GLPs,” he added. Targeting high-growth therapies Eris has reoriented 30% of its portfolio toward high-growth therapies—segments with volume growth above 3–4% annually. These include biologics, injectables, dermatology, and loss-of-exclusivity (LOE) opportunities. “This change in portfolio gives us a big tailwind,” Krishnakumar said. The company’s domestic branded formulations business grew ahead of the Indian Pharmaceutical Market (IPM), aided by this strategic shift and strong field execution. Debt reduction and M&A pause Eris is also on track to reduce its net debt to ₹1,800 crore by FY26, or 1.5x EBITDA, funded entirely through internal cash flows. “Two things I never worry about at Eris are EBITDA margin and cash flow,” Krishnakumar said, citing consistent 35–36% margins and 75–80% cash conversion. Eris reported a 41 percent on-year (YoY) increase in its consolidated net profit for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 at Rs 125 crore driven by strong performance in its domestic branded formulations (DBF) business and improved operating margins. The company’s consolidated revenue rose 7.4% YoY to ₹773 crore, while EBITDA grew 11% YoY to ₹277 crore, with margins expanding by 106 basis points to 35.8%. Following the Biocon acquisition, Eris is taking a pause on large M&A. “We’re not in a rush,” he said. “Our journey over the next three years will be about going deeper into what we already have—oncology, critical care, injectables, women’s health.” While many Indian pharma companies are expanding into trade generics, Eris is scaling down its presence in that segment. “Our DNA is top of the pyramid,” Krishnakumar said. “We’ve expanded our covered market from ₹70,000 crore to ₹120,000 crore without getting into acute therapies,” he said.

Further follow-through upmove above the initial hurdle of 24750 could confirm the bottom reversal pattern. The crucial supports to be watched around 24350. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities Nifty witnessed a roller-coaster session as the index oscillated between 24,350 and 24,650. Although it briefly fell below 24,400, it did not sustain at lower levels and recovered smartly in the second half, closing near 24,600. In the short term, the index may continue to recover; however, immediate resistance is seen at 24,660. A decisive move above this level could take the index towards 24,850.

"Nifty Realty drops 1.4%, extends losses for third day: 5 reasons behind sector-wide sell-off",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/nifty-realty-drops-1-4-extends-losses-for-third-day-5-reasons-behind-sector-wide-sell-off-13413403.html,"Real estate stocks recorded significant losses on August 7, pushing the Nifty Realty index down 1.4 percent. The index has now extended losses for the third consecutive session, buoyed by multiple factors. The realty index has recorded losses in 11 out of 13 straight sessions. The index declined nearly 15 percent in 2025 so far, after a strong surge of nearly 45 percent in 2024. Several factors have led to the decline in the share prices. No repo rate cut in August: RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra on August 6 announced the Monetary Policy Committee’s decision to snap a three-time streak and keep repo rate unchanged at 5.5 percent. Repo rates directly influence home loan interest rates, affecting EMIs and loan costs. Hence, no rate cut dampens sentiment. While a rate cut, as the real estate sector at large was hoping for, would have further accelerated the demand for homes across segments, borrowing costs continue to remain at relatively accommodative levels, supported by the cumulative 100 basis points reduction earlier this year, said Ashok Kapur, Chairman, Krishna Group and Krisumi Corporation. Additionally, several analysts already expect the RBI to cut its repo rate in October during this year. This may boost the real estate stocks in the near term. IT layoffs: TCS recently announced massive layoffs. Nearly 12,000 employees are set to part ways from the IT major. Analysts consider this to be a precursor to further layoffs in the tech sector. This can have some repercussion on India’s economic growth going forward including in sectors like real estate and more, said Samir Jasuja, Founder & CEO, PropEquity, who also noted how housing sales have come down from its recent highs. Trump tariffs: US President Donald Trump has doubled his tariffs on India to 50 percent. While it has no direct bearing with India domestic real estate market, it will likely create an impact on the individual earnings of some sectors like IT, which may in turn reduce discretionary spending limits. This may bear an impact on real estate demand. Subdued real estate prices: The sharp fall in the share prices comes on the back of subdued real estate prices, says Shravan Shetty, Managing Director at Primus Partners. According to Shetty, lower GDP growth, higher interest rates, along with high supply expected in key markets like Mumbai, especially in the luxury space, are keeping real estate prices subdued. This will likely put pressure on the margins of these real estate companies as input costs continue to rise over the next few quarters. Weak earnings: The recent drop in the stocks was also driven by weak earnings announced by some of the key players. Oberoi Realty on July 21 reported a 28 percent decline in Q1 net profit. Macrotech Developers and few others also reported sequential decline in bottom line. ASSOCHAM however feels that real estate stocks will instead find support from stable rates of RBI, as it signals stability despite global uncertainties. Vimal Nadar, National Director and Head of Research, Colliers India, also noted that stability in monetary policy augurs well for homebuyers and real estate developers, particularly in the affordable and mid-income segments. The lowering of interest rates in the recent past is expected to be fully passed on to the end users in upcoming quarters, who are likely to benefit from reduced financing costs. Overall, the cautious yet growth-supportive monetary policy is likely to strengthen demand across real estate segments in the second half of 2025. Additionally, several analysts already expect the RBI to cut its repo rate in October during this year. This may further boost the real estate stocks in the near term. The shares of Raymond and Brigade Enterprises dropped nearly 3 percent each, while DLF, Godrej Properties and Macrotech Developers (Lodha) shares were down nearly 2 percent each, as seen at 2 pm. Sobha and Anant Raj shares were down nearly 1 percent, Phoenix Mills and Oberoi Realty shares were trading in the red with marginal losses.

Bajaj slashed production of its electric two-wheelers by up to 50 percent in July, citing a global shortage of heavy rare earth magnets. The company expects output to remain constrained in August and September as well, with production forecast to stay at just over half of planned levels. The disruption has been triggered by China’s suspension of rare earth magnet exports since April. As the dominant force in the sector, China accounts for 60 percent of global rare earth production and 90 percent of refining. Its pause has sent tremors across global supply chains, particularly impacting EV makers who rely on these magnets for high-efficiency motors and critical electronics.

As supply chains remain strained, manufacturers like Hero are now focused on finding workarounds to ensure production stability in the months ahead. The company reported a mixed June quarter. The two-wheeler major posted a flat net profit of Rs 1,126 crore for Q1FY26, marginally higher than Rs 1,123 crore in the same quarter last year, and ahead of estimates. A Moneycontrol poll of eight brokerages had pegged the net profit at Rs 1,054 crore. Chief Financial Officer Vivek Anand said profitability remained resilient, supported by healthy demand for entry-level and deluxe motorcycles and the 125cc scooter segment. He added that the company’s electric mobility business under the VIDA brand continued to gain momentum, while international operations outperformed the broader market. The company said it expects retail demand to remain strong in the coming quarters, aided by festive tailwinds and a robust pipeline of new product launches. At about 12:50 pm, shares of the company were trading at Rs 4,570, higher by 2.13 percent from the last close on the NSE. Hero MotoCorp shares have risen 18 percent in the last three months.

"From textile to shrimp stocks, Trump's twin tariffs leave Indian export stocks gasping",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/from-textile-to-shrimp-stocks-trump-s-twin-tariffs-leave-indian-export-stocks-gasping-13412295.html,"US President Donald Trump's double-tariff salvo hit Indian equity markets on August 7, triggering a sharp selloff in labor-intensive sectors such as textiles, seafood, and auto components. Market experts believe this pressure could linger, particularly in stocks with significant US exposure, until the tariff uncertainty clears or India's trade disadvantage narrows compared to competing nations. As per data, all three sectors – textile stocks, auto component makers, and shrimp exporters – felt the brunt of Trump's announcement. The initial 25 percent tariff was declared on July 31 and takes effect starting today. A second penalty of another 25 percent was announced shortly after, citing India’s ongoing purchases of Russian oil, which the US alleges fuels the war in Ukraine.  This second blow also comes just before a planned US delegation visit to India in mid-August for the sixth round of trade negotiations. India's firm stand against opening its dairy and agricultural markets has irked US officials. While experts believe this could be a negotiation tactic, the twin tariffs, if fully enforced, risk bringing India-US trade to a virtual standstill. Here’s a breakdown of how sectoral and individual stocks are reacting to the tariff fallout: Gokaldas Exports Roughly 70 percent of Gokaldas Exports’ revenue comes from the US market. The fresh tariff increases the competitive gap between India and other textile exporting countries such as Bangladesh, Vietnam, and even Pakistan. Chandan Taparia, Senior Vice President at Motilal Oswal, noted that the stock is trading at its lowest level in fifteen months and has a weak structure for the upcoming sessions. He marked Rs 600 as a key support level. The company’s management said in its earnings call that they expect margin pressure in Q2 due to both tariffs and seasonal weakness. Assuming an average tariff of 20 percent across major exporting nations and a three times markup, the margin impact on end consumers could be 7 to 8 percent. However, the management expects the impact to be temporary and margins to normalise by early FY27. Welspun Living With 50 percent of its revenue coming from the US, Welspun Living has already reported an 11 percent decline in revenue in the June quarter due to tariff-related uncertainties. The company now plans to take a more conservative approach in Q2 and expects continued pressure on both margins and revenues. “Retailers and suppliers have taken a cautious stance, with inventory correction happening at the retail level. We expect demand to recover once there’s clarity on tariffs and revised cost structures,” the management said. Taparia of Motilal Oswal projected a potential downside of another 10 percent in the stock due to continued volatility. Pearl Global Pearl Global expects a margin dilution of 50 to 60 basis points in Q1FY26 on a quarter-on-quarter basis due to burden-sharing of tariffs. The company’s US revenue share has dropped significantly from around 85 percent in FY21 to approximately 48 percent now. Pearl Global absorbed around 2 percent of the tariff cost for its US clients and passed on the remainder down the value chain. However, management remains confident that its diversified manufacturing base across India, Bangladesh, and Vietnam will help soften the blow of US tariff volatility. Bharat Forge Bharat Forge derives around 40 to 45 percent of its revenue from the US. Analysts at YES Securities have cut their FY26 and FY27 earnings per share estimates by 11.5 percent and 5 percent, respectively. The analysts cited the dual impact of the new US tariffs and stricter emission regulations in North America as reasons for a cautious export outlook. While Q2FY26 is expected to remain muted, the company expects a recovery in the second half of FY26, largely driven by exports. Raja Venkatraman, co-founder of Neotrader sees support zone down 40 percent from current market price at Rs 680, with resistance placed around Rs 800.  Sona BLW Around 30 to 35 percent of Sona BLW’s revenue is linked to the US market. Although global tariff wars and a weak macroeconomic outlook continue to present headwinds, the company’s decision to scale up production in Mexico could provide a buffer against these pressures, according to independent analyst Ambareesh Baliga. Technically, the stock is at its lowest level in four years. Taparia sees Rs 380 to Rs 400 as crucial support zones, compared to the current market price of Rs 435. Avanti feeds As of the March quarter last year, Avanti Feeds derived 77 percent of its revenue from the North American market. Indian shrimp exports are highly vulnerable to US policy decisions, with nearly 48 percent headed to the US. Taparia expects the stock structure to remain weak in the near term, with potential downside of up to 10 percent amid tariff-linked risks.  Apex Frozen Foods In its March quarter investor presentation, Apex Frozen Foods revealed that 53 percent of its revenue comes from the United States. Currently, Indian shrimp exports to the US face an effective customs duty of 17.7 percent, including 5.7 percent countervailing duties and 1.8 percent anti-dumping duty. With Trump’s proposed additional tariffs, this could surge to 50 percent within 21 days. Venkatraman of Neotrader, said that the stock has near-term support at Rs 200 and resistance around Rs 230.

"Hero MotoCorp to stay within 14–16% margin band; near-term at lower end, says CFO",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/hero-motocorp-to-stay-within-14-16-margin-band-near-term-at-lower-end-says-cfo-13412444.html,"Hero MotoCorp expects its operating margins to stay within the 14–16 percent range, but will likely operate at the lower end of that band in the near term, Chief Financial Officer Vivek Anand said during the company’s Q1FY26 earnings call. Anand pointed out that while margins held steady at 14.4 percent in the June quarter despite softer volumes, some cost pressures may re-emerge as volumes pick up in the coming quarters. Still, he reaffirmed the company’s margin guidance and said Hero would manage costs prudently to stay within the stated range. Also read: NSDL rises 7%, extends post-listing gains to 13%; newly-listed Sri Lotus rises 4%, Laxmi India Finance falls 4% The company saw gross margin improve by 100 basis points year-on-year, aided by price hikes and a richer product mix. However, the gains were offset by adverse operating leverage due to lower revenues following a planned production cut in April. Operating expenses were slightly lower in absolute terms compared to the year-ago period, thanks to continued cost control measures. The company reported a mixed June quarter. The two-wheeler major posted a flat net profit of Rs 1,126 crore for Q1FY26, marginally higher than Rs 1,123 crore in the same quarter last year, and ahead of estimates. A Moneycontrol poll of eight brokerages had pegged the net profit at Rs 1,054 crore. Chief Financial Officer Vivek Anand said profitability remained resilient, supported by healthy demand for entry-level and deluxe motorcycles and the 125cc scooter segment. He added that the company’s electric mobility business under the VIDA brand continued to gain momentum, while international operations outperformed the broader market.

Hold Prudent Corporate Advisory Services: target of Rs 2535: ICICI Securities,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/hold-prudent-corporate-advisory-services-target-of-rs-2535-icici-securities-13412596.html,"ICICI Securities's research report on Prudent Corporate Advisory Services Prudent Corporate Advisory Services (Prudent) has progressed well in terms of AUM growth aided by MTM, traction in SIP and growth in MFDs. AUM/gross SIP flows/MFD count clocked CAGR of 40%/20%/19% between FY20–25 and grew 13.9% QoQ / 27.7% YoY /12.8% YoY in Q1FY26, respectively. Its superior execution in insurance segment (insurance premium / revenue grew 11%/22% YoY in Q1) is notable. Upside risks may emanate from continued traction in SIP (38% of client base is yet to have any SIP scheme) and spike in insurance cross-sales. Higher mix of equity within AUM (96.7%) lends higher growth potential for Prudent vs. AMCs. Any MTM fall in AUM, rise in direct mix (AUM mix under direct plans has increased to 47.3% in Jun’25 vs 45% in Jun’24) and cut in commissions (both AMC and insurance) are additional risks. There is an increasing trend of commission rationalisation by AMCs. While Prudent can pass on the same to distributors, it is a risk considering the reduction in overall payout to distributors.

Hold Lupin: target of Rs 1950: ICICI Securities,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/hold-lupin-target-of-rs-1950-icici-securities-13412595.html,"ICICI Securities's research report on Lupin Lupin’s Q1FY26 result was largely in-line with our estimates. Launch of Tolvaptan in US (180 days exclusivity) helped Lupin offset the impact of price erosion in its US portfolio and a muted performance in India. While the exclusivity in Tolvaptan may last for another quarter, other launches lined up in the near term may not help Lupin sustain its current leg of momentum in US. Management guides for double-digit growth in US and overall business in FY26 with EBITDA margin between 24–25% while, in FY27, it may achieve single-digit revenue growth as margins expand further. We cut our FY27E EPS a tad, by ~1%, to factor in muted performance in India. Retain HOLD; TP revised to INR 1,950 (vs. INR 2,110), based on 20x FY27E EPS. Outlook We expect margin to be at ~23% in FY27E, as loss of exclusive products in US may weigh it down. The stock trades at attractive valuation of 21.2x FY26E and 19.4x FY27E earnings. Maintain HOLD with a lower TP of INR 1,950 based on 20x FY27E EPS (22x FY27E EPS earlier).

BHL generated strong FCF of INR 9bn in Q1, and capex intensity moderated with the completion of rural expansion. Fixed broadband revenue growth remains strong (+10.6% QoQ), and FWA ishelping BHL in expanding its addressable market.
