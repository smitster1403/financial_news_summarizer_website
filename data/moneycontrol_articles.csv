Why Japan’s yen intervention could rattle global markets,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/why-japan-s-yen-intervention-could-rattle-global-markets-13794210.html,"Highlights While Indian equity markets grapple with their own challenges—foreign investor exodus amid disappointing corporate earnings—a far more serious issue is unfolding in global currency markets. The Japanese yen's decline threatens to add volatility across equity markets worldwide. History suggests that unless this currency crisis is arrested, investors should brace for heightened turbulence and accelerated selling pressure. Understanding yen intervention At the heart of this crisis lies the question of government intervention in currency markets. Yen intervention occurs when the Japanese government, typically through the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance, actively buys or sells yen in foreign exchange markets to influence its value. The goal is to prevent excessive currency movements that could damage the Japanese economy—a very weak yen inflates import costs and drives up inflation, while an overly strong yen undermines exporters by making Japanese goods less competitive globally. Historically, Japan intervened to weaken the yen when it became too strong. However, the playbook changed dramatically from 2022 to 2024. As the Bank of Japan maintained ultra-low interest rates while the Federal Reserve and other central banks aggressively hiked rates, investors fled to higher-yielding currencies, sending the yen plummeting to multi-decade lows. Japan was forced to reverse course, intervening to support rather than suppress its currency. Throughout 2024, Japan conducted four separate interventions whenever the yen approached or breached 160 per dollar, collectively spending nearly $100 billion to prop up the currency. The market response was violent and immediate. When Japan intervened in late April and early May 2024, deploying a record $36.9 billion in yen purchases on April 29, the Nikkei 225 plunged 12 percent. By July 11, the index had fallen 27% from its peak, illustrating how yen strengthening creates immediate headwinds for Japan's export-heavy economy. The most dramatic episode came in early August 2024, not from intervention alone but from the Bank of Japan's rate hike and the subsequent unwinding of yen carry trades. On August 5, Japan's Topix and Nikkei 225 indexes crashed more than 12%—the steepest single-day drop since 1987. Global markets followed suit, though with smaller percentage declines. The cryptocurrency sector bore the brunt, with most coins recording losses up to 20 percent. Yet the recovery proved equally swift. Within 24 hours, the Nikkei surged 10.2 percent as the Bank of Japan signalled it wouldn't raise rates further amid market instability. This whipsaw action underscored the short-term, violent nature of yen intervention's impact, even as markets generally discount these events before they occur. The current crisis Fast forward to January 2025, and the same dangerous dynamics are reappearing. The yen approached 159.225 on January 23 before sharp warnings from Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi triggered a pullback to 155.6. The pair fell further to 154.2 on January 26—its lowest level since mid-November. But the relief was short-lived as the currency has since rebounded toward 160, with analysts predicting it could reach this critical threshold within days if weakness continues. The market received an unprecedented signal on January 24 when the Federal Reserve Bank of New York contacted financial institutions about the yen's exchange rate—a move typically seen as a precursor to intervention and potential coordinated US-Japan action. This sparked the biggest one-day yen rally since August. As analysts warn, when the US Treasury starts making calls, it signals that the situation has escalated beyond a normal foreign-exchange story. For now, intervention fears alone have pushed the yen off 18-month lows, offering temporary relief to Japanese policymakers concerned about the currency's inflationary impact. Political and economic headwinds The timing couldn't be worse for Japanese authorities. With snap elections scheduled for February, the 160 level has become a politically charged crisis indicator that resonates with Japanese voters, according to local media. The bond market reflects this stress—the 40-year JGB yield broke 4% on January 20 for the first time since 1995, while 30-year yields hit 3.875%, both at historic highs. Meanwhile, traders hold record-high short positions in the yen, making the market vulnerable to a violent squeeze. Compounding the challenge, nearly all ruling and opposition parties are calling for tax cuts ahead of the election, a stance that adds pressure on the yen. The intervention dilemma The critical question is whether intervention can actually stabilise markets. Analysts remain deeply sceptical. They warn that intervention without supporting policy changes will likely prove ineffective, potentially even allowing traders to build larger short positions within hours. The real solution, they argue, requires a Bank of Japan rate hike, potentially at the upcoming meeting. According to a DBS report, the Bank of Japan is behind the curve in normalising monetary policy, while the government has fallen short of its debt consolidation targets. Yet the broader economy shows resilience—public debt concerns arise amid an economy experiencing vibrant private capital-market activity for the first time in decades, with flourishing M&A activity and a soaring domestic stock market. Japan's public sector debt remains a source of concern, but economic momentum appears unlikely to be derailed. Still, the yen's overshooting may require intervention, especially given the risk of antagonising the United States. The limits of US-Japan coordination Despite signs of coordination between Washington and Tokyo, analysts doubt this represents a lasting solution. Shota Ryu, FX strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities, observes: ""In reality, the US probably doesn't want to buy a currency like the yen that has seen its value depreciate for five straight years. Washington could possibly cooperate with one small intervention. But it won't help in a way that could have a lasting effect in turning around the yen's downtrend."" The constraints are mutual. Japan would need to sell portions of its US Treasury holdings to sustain its yen-buying intervention—a move that could push up US yields, something Washington would oppose amid current market volatility. As Takuya Kanda, analyst at Gaitame.com Research Institute, notes: ""It's unlikely the US, worried about global de-dollarisation, will conduct direct dollar-selling intervention."" The greater market risk Perhaps the most significant threat lies in what another round of intervention could trigger. A rise in interest rates risks another unwinding of yen carry trades, potentially recreating the August 2024 market chaos. The rapid unwinding demonstrated how a single policy change in Japan can send profound ripples across interconnected global markets, with investors worldwide experiencing significant losses. The Japanese government must navigate between allowing inflationary currency weakness and triggering market chaos through heavy-handed intervention. Without genuine monetary policy normalisation from the Bank of Japan, any intervention risks becoming a costly, temporary Band-Aid. Whether through coordinated intervention, interest rate hikes, or market forces alone, resolution appears inevitable. The question is not if but when—and at what cost to global financial stability. Investors would be wise to monitor the 160 level closely, as a breach could mark the beginning of another turbulent chapter in the ongoing yen crisis, with reverberations felt far beyond Tokyo's trading floors.

"ONGC, Oil India shares jump up to 10% to new record highs as oil prices rise",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/ongc-oil-india-shares-jump-up-to-10-to-new-record-highs-as-oil-prices-rise-13794243.html,"The shares of state-run Oil & Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Oil India jumped up to 10 percent in trade on January 28, tracking the sharp rise in oil prices. This comes amid supply concerns after a severe winter storm disrupted US crude output and exports. Additionally, rising tensions in the Middle East also supported oil prices. Brent crude futures rose 33 cents to $67.90 a barrel, while WTI Crude futures gained 42 cents to trade at $62.81 per barrel, as seen at 11 am. The two stocks were among the top gainers on the Nifty Oil & Gas index, which was up more than 3 percent at 11,735.55. Why are oil prices rising? Oil extended gains as analysts estimated that US producers lost up to 2 million barrels per day or roughly 15 percent of national output over the weekend as the storm strained energy infrastructure and power grids. Crude and liquefied natural gas exports from U.S. Gulf Coast ports tumbled to zero on Sunday, Reuters quoted ship tracking service Vortexa as saying. The report added that Toshitaka Tazawa, an analyst at Fujitomi Securities, said that a loss of production in Kazakhstan is also underpinning the rally in oil prices. ""But once supply fears ease, selling pressure is likely to return,"" Tazawa added. He further said that an estimated global crude supply surplus this year amid geopolitical risks, including the Middle East tensions, could keep WTI trading around $60 a barrel for now. Tensions between US and Iran are also supporting oil prices. Reuters reported citing sources that a US aircraft carrier and supporting warships have arrived in the Middle East. This has raised the prospect of US President Donald Trump following through on his threat to attack Iran's senior leadership in response to the violent crackdown on nationwide protests, said ANZ analysts in a note. ONGC share price: ONGC shares jumped more than 7 percent to hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs 266.2 apiece. Earlier yesterday, ONGC announced that it entered into Ship Building Contracts (SBCs) with South Korea’s Samsung Heavy Industries for the construction of two state-of-the-art Very Large Ethane Carriers (VLEC). “ONGC and MOL Japan have set up two joint venture companies, Bharat Ethane One IFSC Pvt. Ltd. and Bharat Ethane Two IFSC Pvt. Ltd., in GIFT City, Gujarat, with each company owning and operating one VLEC. These vessels will support the transportation of about 600 KTPA of ethane for OPaL, a subsidiary of ONGC,” the company said in a press release. The VLECs will be Indian-flag, with a cargo capacity of one lakh cubic meters each, it added. ONGC shares have gained nearly 9 percent in the past five days, and more than 12 percent in the past one month. Oil India share price: Oil India shares jumped nearly 10 percent to hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs 492 apiece. The stock has gained more than 11 percent in the past five days, and over 18 percent in the past one month. Follow all LIVE updates from the stock markets here."
"Axis Bank shares extend rally to record high level on strong Q3 results, help Bank Nifty reclaim 59,500",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/axis-bank-shares-extend-rally-to-record-high-level-on-strong-q3-results-help-bank-nifty-reclaim-59-500-13794110.html,"Axis Bank shares on Wednesday extended their rally to a record high, rising more than 4 percent after the private sector lender reported a 4 percent growth in its net profit for the December quarter, helping the Bank Nifty reclaim the 59,500 level. The stock jumped to a fresh 52-week high of Rs 1,369.40 per share on the National Stock Exchange (NSE). It opened gap-up with a gain of 2.45 percent and added to the momentum seen over the past two sessions. The shares of the largecap company have gained nearly 7 percent in the last two days. On Tuesday, Axis Bank shares surged 4.59 percent to close at Rs 1,315.80, marking the biggest single-day percentage rise for the stock in the past 15 months. According to analysts at Centrum, Axis Bank’s quarterly performance exceeded expectations, driven by strong fee income momentum and improving cost-to-income dynamics, which should ease concerns around margin compression. Emkay Research raised its price target on the stock to Rs 1,475 from Rs 1,400, citing attractive valuations. The company’s market capitalisation rose by Rs 7,126.82 crore to Rs 4,15,529.26 crore on Wednesday, compared with Rs 4,08,185.06 crore in the previous session. Axis Bank on Monday reported a 4 percent increase in net profit to Rs 7,010.65 crore for the December quarter, compared with Rs 6,742.99 crore in the year-ago period. On a standalone basis, profit rose to Rs 6,489.57 crore from Rs 6,303.77 crore a year earlier. The lender’s net interest income grew 5 percent to Rs 14,287 crore, supported by a 14 percent rise in loans,  though net interest margin declined by 29 basis points to 3.64 percent. Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director Amitabh Chaudhry said the bank’s ambition remains unchanged and it aims to outpace system growth in a sustainable manner. The gross non-performing assets ratio improved to 1.40 percent from 1.46 percent in the preceding quarter. Provisions increased to Rs 2,245.92 crore from Rs 2,155.63 crore in the year-ago period. The sharp rise in the Axix Bank shares also led to a rub-off effect as the Bank Nifty advanced to a high of 59,659.15. Yes Bank and HDFC Bank were among the other top two gainers, rising up to 2 percent.

"DCB Bank Q3 FY26: Earnings momentum builds, re-rating still has legs",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/moneycontrol-research/dcb-bank-q3-fy26-earnings-momentum-builds-re-rating-still-has-legs-13793999.html,"Highlights DCB Bank (CMP: Rs 198; Market cap: Rs 6,379 crore; Rating: Overweight) reported its highest-ever quarterly profit of Rs 185 crore in Q3 FY26, marking an increase of 23 percent YoY (year-on-year) despite one-off expense related to new labour code. The bank’s performance was broad-based, driven by healthy loan growth, robust fee income, better margins, improvement in operating efficiency, stronger asset quality, and contained credit costs.  More encouragingly, the management expects margin expansion to continue through Q2 FY27, assuming no further rate cuts by the RBI. It has guided for a ROE (return on equity) of 13.5 percent in FY26 and 14.5 percent in FY27 — levels the bank has already effectively achieved in Q3 FY26. The reported ROA (return on asset) and the ROE for the quarter stood at 0.91 percent and 12.73 percent, respectively. However, excluding the one-off impact of the new labour code, the ROA would have been 1.01 percent and the ROE a healthy 14.1 percent in Q3 FY26, underscoring the underlying strength of profitability. DCB Bank’s stock has outperformed the sector benchmark (Bank Nifty) and overall market (Nifty) surging 46 percent and 70 percent in the past 6 months and 1 year respectively.  The key question now is whether this rally can sustain. The most compelling aspect of DCB Bank is its valuation. Even after a sharp rally, the stock trades at only 0.9x its estimated FY27 book value, making it attractive. While a valuation re-rating hinges on the bank’s ability to sustain consistent performance, several profitability levers are in place that could drive further upside. Healthy business growth, robust fee income DCB Bank has maintained steady growth, with net advances rising to Rs 56,600 crore as of December 2025, reflecting a 18 percent YoY increase. DCB Bank aims to double its balance sheet over the next 3-3.5 years, targeting an annual loan growth of 18-22 percent. Mortgages constitute around 50 percent of the loan book as of September end. DCB’s deposits grew by 20 percent YoY till end December’25, higher than the banking system deposit growth, albeit on a smaller base. DCB’s CASA deposits ratio of 23 percent remains much lower compared to the banking system average. That said, it is reassuring to see the bank strengthening the granularity of its deposit base. Deposits from the top 20 depositors have come down to 6.61 percent of total deposits as of December 2025, compared to 15 percent in FY18, which adds stability to its funding profile. DCB Bank’s core fee income grew a strong 29 percent YoY, driven by robust traction in third-party distribution, trade finance, and processing fees. The management expects this momentum to sustain in Q4, which is seasonally strong for fee income. Over the medium term, the bank is confident of sustaining fee income at around 1 percent of average assets, broadly in line with the 1.1 percent achieved in Q3 FY26.  Margin expansion to continue DCB’s net interest margin (NIM) came in at 3.27 percent in Q3 FY26, up 2 basis points YoY from the previous quarter (Q2 FY26). The management has guided to a gradual margin expansion from here onward till Q2 FY27, assuming the RBI doesn’t implement further rate cuts. The improvement is expected to play out over the next 3-4 quarters as the bank’s long-tenure fixed deposits will mature and get repriced at lower rates. In addition to lower funding costs, improved yields are expected to drive margin expansion. Over the past five years, DCB Bank has steadily built its home loan portfolio, which now accounts for nearly half of its mortgage book. Going forward, the bank aims to raise the share of business loans (LAP), which generate higher yields than home loans, while keeping the lower-margin co-lending portfolio capped at 15 percent of total advances. The bank had borrowings of more than Rs 8,000 crore as of March’25, which has declined to less than Rs 5,000 crore as the bank replaced it with relatively lower cost deposits. Together, the decline in funding costs and a more profitable product mix should support margin expansion. Operating efficiency improves DCB Bank effectively controlled its operating expenses aided by a reduction in employee base. Despite the one-off expense of Rs 27 crore in Q3 FY26, the cost-to-average assets ratio remained stable at 2.59 percent in Q3 FY26. Looking forward, the bank expects to benefit from the operating leverage as the balance sheet grows further. The management anticipates the cost-to-average-assets ratio to remain steady in the range of 2.5-2.6 percent and targets a cost-to-income ratio of 60 percent or below in the near term.  Asset quality strengthens DCB Bank’s asset quality improved meaningfully in Q3 FY26, with a decline in both gross and net NPAs. More importantly, slippages fell to an 18-quarter low, signalling better asset quality trends. As a result, credit costs remained contained at just 37 bps—well below management’s guided 45 bps—even after accounting for floating provisions. The restructured book eased slightly but remains elevated at Rs 811 crore (1.4 percent of advances) as of December 2025 and needs to be monitored closely. View and Valuation Overall, DCB bank is poised for a healthy loan growth, margin expansion (assuming no further rate cut), stable cost-to-assets ratio, and a very low credit cost in near to medium term. This guidance is very encouraging and should drive healthy earnings growth in FY27 Despite the sharp rally post earnings, DCB Bank is trading at just 1 time FY27 estimated book value. The valuation can move above 1x forward BV on sectoral tailwinds which along with healthy earnings growth will drive a meaningful stock upside in the near to medium term. Long-term investors should buy the stock. Follow @nehadave01. For more research articles, visit our Moneycontrol Research page."
Asian Paints shares tumble 7% after 'lacklustre' Q3 results; brokerages expect delay in demand recovery,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/asian-paints-shares-tumble-7-after-lacklustre-q3-results-brokerages-expect-delay-in-demand-recovery-13794089.html,"The shares of Asian Paints tumbled nearly 7 percent on January 28 as brokerages analysed the company's results for the October-December quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026. The shares of the paint-maker dropped to Rs 2,451 apiece in the early trading hours of Wednesday. This is the lowest level seen by the stock since October last year. Asian Paints Q3 Results: Asian Paints on January 28 reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 1,060 crore for Q3 FY26, marking a 4.6 percent year-on-year (YoY) fall from Rs 1,110.48 crore net profit reported in Q3 FY25. This however includes exceptional items of Rs 157.61 crore due to labour code and Impairment loss following acquisition of Obgenix Software Private Limited ('White Teak'). The firm's revenue from operations meanwhile rose around 4 percent YoY to Rs 8,867.02 crore. Consolidated net sales increased 3.9 percent YoY to Rs 8,849.7 crore during the quarter under review. Motilal Oswal on Asian Paints: Motilal Oswal said that Asian Paints delivered a ""lacklustre performance"" as growth delivery remained soft despite a favorable base and multiple initiatives. ""A shorter festive period and an extended monsoon did weigh on 3Q performance and further delay demand recovery,"" the brokerage said. ""The management commentary on demand recovery was uninspiring, especially after the constructive commentary post-2QFY26. APNT expects volumes to be in the 8-10% range and value growth of ~5% in the near term. That said, management maintained its EBITDA margin guidance of 18-20%, aided by formulation and sourcing efficiencies. We model 10% revenue CAGR over FY26-28E along with ~19% EBITDA margin for FY27/FY28E,"" Motilal added. Given slower demand recovery and competitive pressure, Motilal expects the near-term growth outlook to remain muted. ""However, as the paint category enjoys pentup demand, we will be watchful if the recovery pace picks up faster in the coming seasonal quarters. The company is focusing on product innovation, brand salience, regionalization, and execution excellence to negate competitive pressure,"" it added. Motilal cut its EPS estimates by 1-3 percent over FY26-28E. It reiterated its ‘Neutral’ rating on the stock, with a target price of Rs 2,950 apiece, which implies an upside potential of nearly 12.5 percent over the stock's previous closing price. JM Financial on Asian Paints: JM Financial said that the company's Q3 results were marginally below expectation. ""Decorative volume/value growth of 7.9%/2.8% YoY was below ours and consensus estimate, despite weak base, owing to shorter festive (impacted October sales, November/December had better growth) and extended monsoons. Management remains cautious on demand trends – a) sees mid-single-digit sales growth as reasonable in near term led by volume growth of c.8-10% and negative price/mix impact of c.4-5% (similar to trends seen in 2Q/3Q), b) prolonged softness in industry growth seen due to some reduction in frequency of painting/occasion-led painting and consumer shift to other discretionary spends. Moreover, based on current trends the negative mix impact (c.4-5%) is likely to sustain for next few quarters (will percolate into FY27E),"" the brokerage said. It cut FY27/28E earnings estimate by 2-3 percent. JM Financial maintained its ‘Reduce’ call on the stock, while lowering its target price to Rs 2,735 apiece. This implies an upside potential of more than 4 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. CLSA on Asian Paints: CLSA kept an ‘Underperform’ call on the shares of Asian Paints, with a target price of Rs 1,875 apiece. This implies a downside potential of more than 28.5 percent over the stock’s previous closing price. The international brokerage said that the firm’s consolidated revenue growth was 2 percent below forecast, while standalone volume growth of 7.9 percent was in-line with an earlier festive season. It cut FY26-28 earnings estimate by 0-7 percent to account for persistence in gap between revenue and volume growth. HSBC on Asian Paints: HSBC downgraded the shares of Asian Paints to ‘Hold’, and cut its target price to Rs 2,900 per share. This implies an upside potential of nearly 11 percent over the previous closing price. The international brokerage said that the firm saw disappointing volume and revenue growth in Q3 FY26. Relatively weaker retail demand trends could persist longer, it added. Follow all LIVE updates from the stock markets here."
"Shadowfax shares make weak market debut, list at 9% discount to IPO price",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ipo/shadowfax-shares-make-weak-market-debut-list-at-9-discount-to-ipo-price-13793981.html,"The shares of Shadowfax Technologies made a weak debut on stock markets on January 28, listing at Rs 112.60 apiece on NSE. This marks a discount of 9.19 percent over the IPO price of Rs 124 apiece. The company debuted with a market capitalization of Rs 6,509.78 crore. On BSE, the shares listed with a slightly lower discount of 8.87 percent over the IPO price at Rs 113 apiece. Listing performance vs grey market estimates: The listing has missed grey market expectations. Ahead of listing, the unlisted shares of Shadowfax Technologies were trading with a grey market discount o 2.82 percent over the IPO price at Rs 120.5 apiece. The grey market estimates quoted by the site has significantly fallen from the 12.90 percent quoted on January 15. According to IPO Watch, the unlisted shares of the company were trading flat at the IPO price at Rs 124 apiece in the grey market. Shadowfax Tech IPO: The weak market debut comes despite the IPO of Shadowfax Technologies closing with 1.68 times subscription during its three days of public bidding between January 20 and January 22. Retail individual investors (RII) and qualified institutional buyers (QIB) had booked their respective reserved portion more than 2 times, while non-institutional investors (NII) subscribed 54 percent of their allotted quota. Bengaluru-based technology-led logistics solutions provider Shadowfax Tech moved to the primary capital market to raise Rs 1,907.2 crore through its initial public offering (IPO), which comprised a fresh issue of shares worth Rs 1,000 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of shares worth Rs 907.2 crore by several investors including Flipkart, Eight Roads Investments, Qualcomm, and NewQuest Asia Fund. The price band for the IPO was set at Rs 118-124 per share. Investors could bid for a minimum of 120 shares, requiring an investment of Rs 14,160, and in multiples thereafter. How will the IPO proceeds be used? The company proposes to utilise proceeds from the fresh issue towards funding enhancing capacity in terms of network infrastructure, funding of lease payments for new first mile, last mile, and sort centres, as well as towards branding, marketing, and communication initiatives, unidentified inorganic acquisitions, and general corporate purposes. Shadowfax IPO anchor book: A day before the IPO opened for public bidding, Shadowfax announced that it has raised Rs 856.02 crore from 39 anchor investors on January 19. ""Out of the total allocation, 3.67 crore equity shares worth Rs 455.73 crore were allocated to nine domestic mutual funds including ICICI Prudential AMC, Nippon Life India, Motilal Oswal AMC, Bandhan Mutual Fund, HSBC MF, Helios MF, JM Financial MF, and Trust Mutual Fund,"" Shadowfax Technologies in its filing to exchanges said. ICICI Prudential AMC was the largest investor in the anchor book, acquiring 1.53 crore equity shares for Rs 190 crore through its four schemes - ICICI Prudential Flexicap Fund, ICICI Prudential Balanced Advantage Fund, ICICI Prudential Transportation and Logistics Fund, and ICICI Prudential Exports and Services Fund. Should you buy, sell or hold? Shadowfax is a technology-driven, asset-light logistics company focused on last-mile delivery, express parcels, reverse logistics and quick commerce services, said Mahesh M. Ojha, VP Research and Business Development at Kantilal Chhaganlal Securities. The company operates across more than 2,300 cities and 14,700 PIN codes and serves clients such as Flipkart, Meesho, Swiggy, Blinkit and Nykaa. The analyst highlighted that the IPO valuation appears relatively rich, when compared to peers like Delhivery. The business also faces intense competition and customer concentration risks, with a significant portion of revenue coming from a small number of large clients. According to him, the stock may be suitable for high-risk investors given the overall positive industry outlook. Investors with a long-term perspective who have already applied may consider holding the stock, while short-term investors could look to book gains on listing, if any. Fresh investors may wait for price discovery after listing. Gaurav Garg, Research Analyst at Lemonn Markets Desk, noted that Shadowfax offers a compelling play on India’s rapidly growing e-commerce and quick-commerce ecosystem. ""With pan-India reach across over 14,700 pincodes and a client roster that includes Flipkart, Meesho, Swiggy, Zomato, and Blinkit, the company has demonstrated strong revenue growth (~32% CAGR FY23–25) and operational scalability through its large gig-based delivery network. Its asset-light model and EBITDA-positive performance since FY24 highlight its improving profitability trajectory,"" the analyst said. He however cautioned that investors should be mindful of the risks and structural constraints. ""Margins remain thin, ROE and ROCE are modest, and revenue is concentrated with its top client contributing around 50%. At the upper price band, the IPO implies an EV/EBITDA of ~106x, which is rich compared with peers, suggesting that current valuations already reflect significant growth expectations,"" he said. Overall, Shadowfax offers long-term exposure to India’s logistics and hyperlocal delivery sector, but the IPO is better suited for investors with a long-term horizon, who are comfortable tracking execution, client diversification, and margin expansion over time, the analyst said. He added that for short-term listing gains, the risk-reward appears balanced but neutral. Follow all IPO news here."

Asian currencies gain as dollar weakens before Fed,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/asian-currencies-gain-as-dollar-weakens-before-fed-13793459.html,"Asian currencies gained as the dollar sank to levels last seen four years ago as investors turned cautious toward the world’s reserve currency amid unpredictable policymaking from Washington. The Malaysian ringgit, Thai baht and the South Korean won all appreciated in early Asian trading after the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index slid to its lowest since February 2022 during the US session. The dollar steadied after its biggest fall since April. The greenback’s decline had accelerated after President Donald Trump said he was not concerned about the weakening. Asian stocks were mixed with South Korea rising and Japan falling. US equity-index futures extended gains as the Wall Street Journal reported SoftBank is in talks to invest up to $30 billion more in OpenAI. The dollar’s weakness reflects uncertainty over policy from the Trump administration, including threats to take over Greenland and comments that have raised concerns about the Federal Reserve’s independence. That forms the backdrop as the Fed announces its interest-rate decision Wednesday, just as traders turn their attention to megacap technology earnings. “The Trump administration is taking a calculated risk,” said Win Thin, chief economist at Bank of Nassau 1982 Ltd. “Foreign exchange typically is the leader in terms of showing market discomfort with a country’s policies and economic outlook, so this dollar weakness bears watching.” The latest decline in the dollar also follows signs of US support to boost the yen, reopening speculation around the potential for coordinated currency intervention to guide the greenback lower against key trading partners. Reports from traders Friday indicated that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York contacted financial institutions to check on the yen’s exchange rate — a preliminary step that’s often taken before interventions. Meanwhile, Trump’s dollar comments added to an earlier slide in the greenback, which reflected a lack of confidence in the US economy partly due to his erratic tariff policy. Speaking to reporters in Iowa, Trump said “the dollar is doing great.” When asked if he wants to see the currency decline more, he replied that he could have it go up or down “like a yo-yo.” In other corners of the market, gold traded slightly below its record high and silver advanced. West Texas Intermediate crude also edged up. The commodities are all priced in dollars. Treasuries were a touch stronger with the yield on the 10-year falling one basis point to 4.23% ahead of Wednesday’s Fed meeting. The central bank is projected to halt its rate-cutting cycle as a steadier jobs market restores a degree of consensus among officials after months of growing division. With the economy still displaying exceptional strength, the Fed’s messaging is likely to emphasize a data‑driven approach to future policy decisions, according to Chris Brigati at SWBC. Also, the tone from this week’s earnings from the so-called ‘Magnificent Seven’ tech companies should be solid. Around a third of S&P 500 companies by market capitalization report results this week. Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc. and Tesla Inc. report earnings on Wednesday, followed by Apple Inc. on Thursday. Alphabet Inc., by far the best performer among megacaps last year, reports on Feb. 4. Results from Amazon.com Inc. land on Feb. 5 and Nvidia Corp.’s on Feb. 25. “This week is pivotal in setting the market’s near‑term tone as 2026 progresses,” Brigati noted. “History shows that a strong January often frames the narrative for the rest of the year, with investor psychology playing an outsized role.”"

Budget 2026: Capital gains tax fears rattle markets as weak sentiment amplifies risk,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/budget-2026-capital-gains-tax-fears-rattle-markets-as-weak-sentiment-amplifies-risk-13793450.html,"As the Union Budget 2026 approaches, investors are growing increasingly nervous about the possibility of further changes to capital gains taxation at a time when equity markets are already fragile. The concern is not driven by any formal proposal, but by the broader market context: volatile equities, sustained foreign investor selling and lingering unease after tax hikes introduced in 2024. Market participants say even the perception that equity taxation could be pushed closer to marginal income tax rates is amplifying anxiety. The fear is less about a headline hike and more about structural shifts that could quietly alter behaviour. These include aligning equity gains with income-tax slabs, frequent changes to holding periods, or raising the burden on short-term trades without reviewing the securities transaction tax. This debate is unfolding against an already layered tax framework, where investors face capital gains tax, STT and currency depreciation pressures at the same time. 2024 Changes Still Casting a Shadow Budget 2024 raised long-term capital gains tax to 12.5 percent, removed indexation benefits for new investments and increased short-term capital gains tax to 20 percent. While markets initially absorbed the changes during a strong rally, corrections later in the year dragged sentiment lower and kept the Nifty largely range-bound through 2025. “When long-term capital gains were raised from 10 percent to 12.5 percent in July 2024, foreign investors were unhappy,” said Tushar Sachde, tax partner at PwC. “Will the government change rates again within a year? The consensus is that it is unlikely.” Still, with 2026 beginning on a volatile note and foreign portfolio investors continuing to sell, investors are reassessing whether the higher tax burden is beginning to bite at the wrong point in the cycle. “Foreign investors look at post-tax returns,” Sachde said. “With higher taxes and the rupee moving closer to 92, they’ve effectively been hit on both counts.” Risk of Sell-Off if Taxes Rise Further Tejas Khoday, co-founder and managing director at Fyers, said the current framework has already stretched market participants. “The system has overshot for active traders,” he said. “Any hike from here could trigger a sharp sell-off because it disincentivises equity investors to stay invested, especially when markets are not delivering returns.” Market participants stress the issue is not whether equities should be taxed. They already are. The concern is about direction. After successive changes, investors are trying to assess whether the government sees the current regime as settled or as a step toward treating capital gains more like regular income. “Frequent tinkering creates instability,” Khoday said. “What markets need is long-term predictability.” Layered Taxes Add to Pressure Satwik Jain of Generational Capital pointed to the cumulative impact of overlapping levies. “STT was introduced in lieu of long-term capital gains. Now you have both,” he said. “Add currency depreciation to that, and post-tax returns get squeezed. Even a directional signal like reducing STT would be taken very positively.” Market participants argue layered taxation combined with currency weakness is hurting risk appetite, particularly for foreign investors and active domestic traders. Government’s Fiscal Limits From the government’s perspective, capital gains remain an important revenue source. A large share of gains accrue to higher-income investors, strengthening the argument that passive income should not enjoy large tax advantages over salaries. At the same time, welfare commitments and infrastructure spending leave limited room for large concessions. “There is limited fiscal headroom,” said PwC’s Sachde. “Any relief has to be weighed against revenue considerations.” However, experts warn that aggressive tax tightening could be counterproductive at a time when markets are central to household financialisation, IPO funding and the government’s own divestment plans. Incremental Tweaks More Likely Most market participants expect incremental changes rather than sweeping reform. These could include a review of STT, rationalisation between short- and long-term rates or structural simplification without raising headline taxes. “STT is almost unique to India. It taxes participation, not profits,” Khoday said. “If you want to widen participation, you need to reduce STT and avoid raising capital gains further.” There is also a growing call for policy stability. “Taxation has become a key issue for foreign investors,” Khoday said. “Most countries don’t tax portfolio investors the way India does. Any further increase becomes a deterrent when post-tax returns are already under pressure.” Trivesh D of Tradejini said even partial relief could help sentiment. “Simplification rather than tightening should be the focus. Reducing STT or easing short-term capital gains could improve risk appetite without distorting long-term investment behaviour.” Markets may have absorbed the 2024 changes, but patience is thinning. What investors want ahead of Budget 2026 is clarity, stability and fewer negative surprises."
Budget 2026 Playbook: 5 triggers that could ignite a post-Budget market rally,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/budget-2026-playbook-5-triggers-that-could-ignite-a-post-budget-market-rally-13793452.html,"Indian equity markets head into the Union Budget with cautious positioning and rising sensitivity to policy signals. With Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman set to present the FY27 Budget on February 1, benchmark indices remain locked in a pre-event consolidation phase, reflecting a market that is waiting for clarity rather than chasing momentum. The Nifty has largely traded in a narrow range amid a volatile global backdrop marked by renewed tariff risks under a potential Trump 2.0 presidency and persistent geopolitical tensions. Domestically, growth expectations for FY26 hover between 6.5 and 7 percent, while investors are closely tracking how the government balances fiscal consolidation with the need to sustain economic momentum. That trade-off becomes even more critical after FY26, when the Centre committed a capital expenditure outlay of Rs 11.21 lakh crore, roughly 3.1 percent of GDP, representing a nearly 10 percent increase over earlier estimates. With volatility already elevated, markets are increasingly focused on execution rather than intent, making the upcoming Budget a potential inflection point for sentiment. 1) Bigger Infrastructure-Led Capex Push A sharper-than-expected increase in capital expenditure, in the range of 10 to 15 percent, taking total capex to Rs 12 to 12.5 lakh crore, or around 3.2 percent of GDP, with a strong focus on infrastructure, could emerge as the single biggest positive trigger for markets. Tejas Khoday said infrastructure spending is no longer optional. “If the government meaningfully increases capital expenditure, particularly in infrastructure, it can immediately lift sentiment because this is where India’s biggest bottlenecks lie,” he said. “For manufacturing to become globally competitive, capex needs to rise sharply. Without sustained spending on roads, railways, ports and maritime routes, the ecosystem simply doesn’t scale.” Ranjit Jha added that public sector investment often sets the tone for the broader cycle. “When the government leads on capex, private players gain confidence and that’s when markets respond,” he said. Public capex is widely estimated to have a multiplier effect of 1.5 to 2 times on GDP, while also reducing logistics costs that remain elevated compared to peers such as China. Strong execution visibility typically benefits cyclical sectors such as cement, steel, capital goods and construction, supporting broader sector re-rating. 2) Targeted Push for High-Growth Strategic Sectors Markets are also watching for sharper policy focus and higher budgetary allocations toward long-term structural growth themes. Above-trend spending on defence, clean energy, railways, AI, data centres, manufacturing and R&D, along with refinements to PLI schemes and FDI norms tied to technology transfer, could revive thematic momentum. Vikas Gupta outlined where expectations are building. “Defence, railways, clean energy, infrastructure, housing, AI, strategic minerals and manufacturing linked to technology transfer are all likely focus areas,” he said. “Sectors aligned with these themes tend to see heightened activity around the budget, especially if allocations surprise on the upside.” Khoday added that innovation-led industries require sustained policy backing. “Incentivising and subsidising R&D can have a direct impact on sectors like IT and pharma,” he said, arguing that targeted support could help companies move up the value chain instead of competing purely on cost. 3) Measures That Put More Money in Consumers’ Hands While capex supports medium-term growth, near-term market sentiment continues to hinge on consumption recovery. Any move that boosts disposable income, whether through a higher standard deduction, modest slab rationalisation or better-targeted transfers, could revive demand across FMCG, auto and retail sectors. Unlike indirect measures such as GST rationalisation, markets are looking for direct income-side relief that translates into immediate spending power. Ranjit Jha put it succinctly: “If the government pumps money into the hands of common people, demand automatically follows,” he said, pointing to consumption as the missing link in the current recovery cycle. 4) Capital Gains Tax Stability For equities, sometimes the strongest positive trigger is the absence of negative surprises. Clear signals of stability on capital gains tax and Securities Transaction Tax, along with any simplification or marginal relief, could play a critical role in sustaining domestic investor confidence. Khoday cautioned against using capital markets as a revenue lever. “The biggest impediment to growth would be further taxing the capital market ecosystem,” he said. “Adding stress here risks demoralising investors and weakening India’s capital formation engine. Ultimately, it is domestic investors who fund Indian companies, and that flow needs stability, not uncertainty.” With foreign investors still selective, domestic mutual fund flows and retail participation have become the backbone of market liquidity. Tax predictability helps preserve risk appetite and valuation support in a market that is no longer cheap. 5) Export and Trade Support Through Customs Rationalisation As global supply chains continue to realign, any push on trade facilitation through customs duty rationalisation, export incentives or progress on strategic bilateral agreements could provide a boost to export-oriented sectors. Ranjit Jha highlighted several emerging opportunities, citing growing momentum around EU-India engagement, expanding defence cooperation with the UAE and disruptions in competing export hubs such as Bangladesh’s textile industry. “These are openings India can capitalise on, provided policy support aligns,” he said. With global growth remaining uneven, India’s attractiveness as a manufacturing and export base improves when input costs fall and trade access expands. Export-linked sectors such as textiles, gems and jewellery and defence manufacturing stand to benefit both on margins and volumes.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade LIC, Indian Hotels, Asahi India Glass, JSW Steel, MCX India, and others on January 28?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-lic-indian-hotels-asahi-india-glass-jsw-steel-mcx-india-and-others-on-january-28-13793413.html,"The benchmark indices recouped some of the previous day’s losses, with the Nifty 50 rising half a percent on January 27, but market breadth remained weak. A total of 1,622 shares were under pressure compared to 1,311 shares that gained on the NSE. The market is expected to remain range-bound amid a rising India VIX. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Amol Athawale, VP Technical Research at Kotak Securities Indian Hotels Company | CMP: Rs 651.35  After the short-term correction in Indian Hotels from higher levels, the downward momentum has stalled and the stock has entered a consolidation phase over the past few sessions. Moreover, the stock is available near its important demand zone. The structure suggests a revival of the uptrend from the current levels in the near future. For traders, Rs 625 would be the key support level to watch. Above this, the uptrend structure could continue towards Rs 695. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 695 Stop-Loss: Rs 625 Tech Mahindra | CMP: Rs 1,745.1  On the weekly charts, Tech Mahindra is in a rising channel chart formation with a higher-high and higher-low series pattern. The stock has witnessed a steady recovery from trendline support levels. Additionally, the technical indicator RSI is indicating a further uptrend from the current levels, which could boost bullish momentum in the near future. For the next few trading sessions, Rs 1,680 could be the trend-decider level for the bulls. If the stock sustains above this level, a further uptrend towards Rs 1,870 can be expected. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,870 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,680 Life Insurance Corporation of India | CMP: Rs 807.8  On a broader timeframe, LIC has been in a prolonged downtrend and is currently in oversold territory. The texture of the chart formation and the technical indicator RSI indicate that the stock is very likely to rebound for a new leg of the upward move from its lower levels. For positional traders, Rs 780 would be the decisive level. Trading above this level, the uptrend formation will continue towards Rs 860. However, if the stock closes below Rs 780, traders may prefer to exit long positions. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 860 Stop-Loss: Rs 780 Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors Asahi India Glass | CMP: Rs 991.9  On the daily chart, Asahi India Glass has been consistently protecting the prior day’s low on a closing basis over the past four trading sessions, indicating strong buying interest emerging from lower levels. Additionally, prices have closed above the mid-Bollinger Bands, suggesting a shift in short-term momentum. With follow-up buying, a move towards the upper Bollinger Bands near the Rs 1,030 zone is expected. Along with this, the MACD has shown a bullish crossover below the zero line, reinforcing the positive outlook for the stock. For now, a sustained break above Rs 1,000 can extend the rise further towards Rs 1,030, followed by Rs 1,065 levels, while immediate support is placed around the Rs 960 level. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,030, Rs 1,065 Stop-Loss: Rs 960 JSW Steel | CMP: Rs 1,222  On the daily chart, JSW Steel has been trading in a broad consolidation range between Rs 1,150 and Rs 1,202 since early January 2026, indicating a phase of accumulation. In the previous session, the stock surged over 4 percent and decisively broke out of this range, also making a fresh record high near the Rs 1,230 level with a sharp rise in volumes, which is a strong bullish signal. Additionally, prices recently found support at the 20-day Exponential Moving Average and bounced higher, confirming improving momentum. For now, a buy-on-dips strategy can be adopted for upside targets of Rs 1,280–1,300 levels. On the downside, Rs 1,170, which is an EMA support, should remain protected. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,280, Rs 1,300 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,170 Aditya Thukral, Founder & Analyst of AT Research & Risk Managers Multi Commodity Exchange of India | CMP: Rs 2,418  A falling trendline breakout has been witnessed in MCX with rising volumes. The stock is consistently trading above all its major exponential moving averages, namely the 20-day, 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day EMAs. An imminent uptrend has been established with the formation of higher highs and higher lows across all timeframes. Now that prices are trading above the short-term resistance of Rs 2,400, an uptrend continuation can be expected. Any minor dip towards the support at Rs 2,400 should be considered a buying opportunity, as previous resistance has turned into support. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,550 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,299 Infosys | CMP: Rs 1,682.7  Infosys has been consolidating within a box pattern formed since December 22, 2025. Now that corrections in the stock are shrinking and an uptrend in prices is still very fresh, a breakout above the resistance at Rs 1,694 could provide a decent upward move. The stock is consistently trading above all its major exponential moving averages—20-day, 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day—with all the EMAs sloping upwards. A breakout above Rs 1,694 would be a continuation of the established uptrend and would provide an opportunity for fresh long positions. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,765 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,660"

JSW Steel shares jump 5% after net profit surges 198% to Rs 717 crore: Here's what brokerages say,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/jsw-steel-shares-jump-5-after-net-profit-surges-198-to-rs-717-crore-here-s-what-brokerages-say-13792738.html,"The shares of JSW Steel jumped around 5 percent on January 27 after the company released its results for the October-December quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026. Brokerages remain bullish, with target prices implying strong upside potential from current levels. The shares of the steel maker closed at Rs 1,223.20 apiece on Tuesday. Earlier during the day, the stock jumped further to hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs 1,230.40 apiece. JSW Steel Q3 Results: JSW Steel reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 2,139 crore for Q3 FY26, marking a 198 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise from Rs 717 crore net profit reported in Q3 FY25. The firm's revenue from operations rose 11 percent YoY to Rs 45,991 crore during the quarter under review. The company’s steel sales grew 14 percent YoY to Rs 7.64 mt, while crude steel production rose 6 percent YoY to 7.48 mt. Motilal Oswal on JSW Steel: Motilal Oswal said the company’s revenue was in-line with estimates, mainly on account of strong volume, which was partially offset by muted NSR. “Adjusted EBITDA was largely in line with our estimate at INR66b (+19% YoY). It dipped 16% QoQ, mainly due to weak NSR and increased input costs,” it added. JSTL reported a decent performance in 3QFY26, supported by volume growth, offsetting muted steel prices. We believe JSTL is well-placed with new capacities coming on-stream, strong domestic demand, and a rising share of value-added proportion in the sales mix. Its focus on increasing the captive share of iron ore and improving coal linkages will support earnings, the domestic brokerage said. Motilal estimates double-digit revenue growth over FY26-FY28, driven by the ramp-up of new capacity and price recovery led by safeguard duty. The brokerage reiterated its ‘Buy’ rating for the stock, with a target price of Rs 1,350 apiece. This implies an upside potential of more than 15 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. PL Capital on JSW Steel: PL Capital upgraded the shares of JSW Steel to ‘Accumulate’ with a target price of Rs 1,292 apiece. This implies an upside potential of more than 10 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. It expects the company to improve its market share over the next few years due to its superior execution capabilities, downstream focus and significant deleveraging post JFE-BPSL deal. “Q3 performance was tad weaker due to weak steel pricing, shutdown costs and deteriorated product mix on higher JVML contribution,” the domestic brokerage noted.

Click to View More Outlook for January 28 Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical and Derivatives Research at SBI Securities On monthly expiry, Nifty experienced a choppy session for the major part of the day before last hour short covering surge. The 25,190–25,200 zone, which acted as a support in the previous session, acted as a strong resistance for the major part of the session before Index managed to close higher. On the daily chart, Nifty formed a sizeable bullish candle with long lower wicks, indicating buying interest at lower levels. Notably, the index has managed to close above the 200-day EMA zone. Going ahead, the key support for Nifty is placed in the 24,950–24,900 zone, which coincides with the upward-sloping trendline, drawn by connecting the swing lows of 24,338 (8th August) and 24,405 (29th August). A decisive breakdown below this zone could result in Nifty extending its weakness towards 24,700, followed by 24,500 in the near term. On the upside, the 25,250–25,300 zone is expected to act as a strong resistance area, limiting any pullback attempts. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The NSE monthly expiry day proved to be a roller-coaster session for the market, as the Nifty witnessed a 300-point swing during the day. On closing, the index ended above the 200-DMA; however, a follow-up move is required before changing the bearish view on the Nifty. Support remains at 24,900, and a slip below this level could unlock fresh selling pressure from the bears. On the higher end, 25,500 continues to be a crucial resistance zone. Until the Nifty decisively breaks above 25,500, a sell-on-rise strategy may continue to work in the market.

India-EU FTA: Should you buy Indian auto stocks as tariffs on EU-made cars to be slashed to 10%? Here's what analysts say,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/india-eu-fta-should-you-buy-indian-auto-stocks-as-tariffs-on-eu-made-cars-to-be-slashed-to-10-here-s-what-analysts-say-13792378.html,"The shares of automakers dropped in trade on January 27, after the India and European Union finalized their much-awaited free trade agreement (FTA). Analysts have commented on what lies ahead for the Indian automakers. India will gradually cut tariffs on cars from 110 percent to as low as 10 percent as part of its new FTA with EU, and fully abolish duties on car parts within five to ten years, the European Commission said in a statement. Currently, the import duty levied by India on completely built-up (CBU) passenger vehicles is 110 percent for cars costing over $40,000, and 70 percent for cars costing up to $40,000. Indian automakers have long opposed such cuts, arguing that they would discourage investment in local production by making imported vehicles more competitive. Should you buy Indian auto stocks? The India-EU FTA will provide EU carmakers greater access to Indian PV market, which is the third largest globally in terms of volume just behind US and China, PL Capital said. The domestic brokerage noted that luxury vehicles comprise approximately 1 percent of the Indian market, therefore the tariff reduction should not impact the mass market players like Maruti Suzuki and entry-to-mid-level vehicles from Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles (TMPV) and Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M). However, it added that the tariff reduction may impact premium plus cars from these players to a small extent. “Tariff reduction on BEVs from 100% is expected to be applicable after 5 years in a phased manner, giving the likes of TMPV and M&M some relief. This India-EU FTA, which has been under negotiation for long,” PL Capital said. The immediate concern for equities is not the long-term competitiveness narrative, but near-term uncertainty around pricing, demand elasticity, and margin protection, said Harshal Dasani, Business Head, INVasset PMS. “Markets are reacting ahead of operational clarity, which explains the visible churn in auto counters despite the absence of any immediate earnings impact,” he said. For investors, the analyst said that the key variables to track are premium-segment exposure, pricing discipline, localisation depth, and export optionality. “Companies with a strong SUV mix, diversified geographic revenues, and robust balance sheets are better positioned to absorb competitive pressure. In the near term, volatility in auto stocks reflects positioning and sentiment, not a structural reset of the industry’s earnings trajectory,” he added. ""There is a strong and positive signal of confidence in India’s long term growth story. India today is not just a large market, but a future ready economy backed by reforms and policies focused on building a globally competitive ecosystem. The India EU Free Trade Agreement would be a historic milestone benefiting both sides by expanding trade and enabling deeper exchange of technology and innovation,"" said Hardeep Singh Brar, President and CEO, BMW Group India.

The company had posted a consolidated net profit of Rs 282 crore in the October-December quarter a year ago, according to a regulatory filing from TCPL, the Tata group's FMCG arm. However, the bottom line was hit by a one-time charge of Rs 22.86 crore tied to the recently enacted labour code. Its revenue from operations rose by 15 percent to Rs 5,112 crore in the December quarter of FY'26. It was at Rs 4,443.56 crore in the year-ago period.

India Cements shares meanwhile jumped nearly 5 percent on Tuesday. JSW Energy Q3 Results: JSW Energy shares dropped to Rs 432.8 apiece, the lowest level seen by the stock since February 19 last year. This came after the company reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 419.94 crore, marking a 150 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise from Rs 167.83 crore net profit reported in the same quarter of the previous financial year. The firm’s revenue from operations meanwhile grew more than 67 percent YoY to Rs 4,081 76 crore during the quarter under review. JM Financial said that the firm’s results marked an “all-round miss”, with debt and execution remaining the pain points. It noted that the company’s management expressed concerns about transmission connectivity beyond 2027, which is a potential risk for aggressive RE expansion. “The company also has 29.6GWh of locked-in energy storage capacity (26.4GWh pumped hydro, 3.2GWh BESS). We cut down our FY28 EBITDA (-17%) and PAT (-52%) estimates factoring moderation in new RE capacity additions and rising interest expenses,” it said. The domestic brokerage however estimates gradual improvement in key performance parameters as JSW Energy progresses in its vision of 30 GW by 2030; Net Debt/EBITDA (6.2x in FY25 to 5.8x in FY30), Gross block/MW (INR 46.7mn/MW in FY25 to INR 69.3mn/MW in FY30) and RoE (6.0% in FY26E to 7.4% by FY30). JM Financial reduced its target price for the stock to Rs 614 apiece, implying an upside potential of 28.5 percent from the previous closing price, while maintaining its ‘Buy’ rating. Motilal Financial Services also noted that the firm’s Q3 revenue missed its estimates primarily due to weaker than expected generation at Ratnagiri, Barmer and KSK Mahanadi plants. It reiterated its ‘Buy’ view on the stock, with a target price of Rs 590 apiece, implying an upside potential of 24 percent. Godrej Consumer Products Q3 Results: Godrej Consumer Products shares dropped to Rs 1,117.10 apiece on Tuesday, the lowest level seen by the stock since early December last year. The company reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 498 crore, marking a marginal decline from the same period last year. The firm's revenue from operations meanwhile rose 9% YoY to Rs 4,099.12 crore. JM Financial downgraded the stock to ‘Add’ from ‘Buy’, with a target price of Rs 1,355 apiece. This implies an upside potential of 9 percent over the stock’s previous closing price. The domestic brokerage said that on the profitability front, gross margin may not materially change considering the shift in product mix, and improvement in EBITDA margin will be led by savings in media and other overheads. “Post the recent run-up (+12% in past 1 month) in stock price, NTM valuation of c.51x is closer to the long-term average and limits the upside,” it added. “In India, we see GCPL logging a high single-digit revenue growth, supported by new actions (favorable season for Household Insecticides likely to aid double-digit growth). We believe India OPM will see gradual expansion, to the higher-end of the normative margin band of 24-26% by FY28E, aiding high-teens EBITDA growth over FY26-28E. Indonesia is likely to be a drag – we see gradual recovery in performance. Africa cluster is likely to see sales growth momentum slowing to a high single-digit, while EBITDA growth is likely to log at a low double digit,” said Emkay Global. The India Cements Q3 Results: The India Cements shares rose to Rs 452.70 apiece, after seeing some decline during the previous session following the release of its Q3 results. The Chennai-headquartered cement maker posted a standalone net loss of Rs 5.72 crore in Q3 FY26, compared to a net loss of Rs 409.38 crore a year earlier. The firm’s revenue from operations meanwhile gained around 23.5 percent YoY to Rs 1,114.13 crore. Motilal Oswal says India Cements is witnessing operational improvement under UltraTech's leadership with recovery in margins and steady improvement in capacity utilization. The brokerage expects the company’s revenue CAGR at 11 percent over FY25-28, led by a volume/realization CAGR of ~9%/2%. Follow all LIVE updates from the stock markets here."

JM Financial on UltraTech Cement: JM Financial said that UltraTech Cement reported a strong Q3 FY26 earnings performance with consolidated EBITDA rising 35 percent YoY to Rs 3,920 crore, beating its estimates primarily due to lower-than-estimated cost/tn. “Management highlighted robust demand momentum is likely to sustain supported by infra projects. The industry has taken price hikes in Jan’26 and anticipates further price hike likely supported by improving demand. We argue UltraTech is poised for structural improvement in return ratios over the next three–four years owing to: i) rising asset turnover; ii) low cost of expansion; and iii) improving profitability. Factoring in the 3Q performance and improving demand/pricing, we are increasing EBITDA by 6% for FY26E and 1–3% for FY27E–28E,” the brokerage said. It maintained its ‘Buy’ rating on the stock, while raising its target price to Rs 14,500 apiece. This implies an upside potential of more than 17 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. Choice Broking on UltraTech Cement: Choice Institutional Equities said that it continues to remain positive on UltraTech Cement due to ambitious and continuous capacity expansion plan to add 8 mnt of capacity in Q4 FY26, and 12 mnt in FY27, funding expansion outlay largely via internal accruals, proactive cost-optimisation strategy, favourable sectoral pricing environment and significant demand growth in expected from the southern market. The domestic brokerage maintained its ‘Buy’ rating on the stock, with a target price of Rs 15,210 apiece. This implies an upside potential of nearly 23 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. Motilal Oswal on UltraTech Cement: Motilal Oswal said that UltraTech Cement’s Q3 FY26 EBITDA was above its estimate, led by higher-than-estimated volume growth and lower-than-estimated opex/t. “Management indicated a positive demand outlook, highlighting a multi-year infrastructure pipeline across all regions, led by roads, metros, railways, ports, airports and housing segments,” the brokerage noted. “We largely maintain our FY26 EBITDA estimate and raise FY27/28 EBITDA estimates by 4% each, considering high volume growth vs. previous estimates. We increase our FY27/28 EPS estimates by ~5% each. We value UTCEM at 18x FY28E EV/EBITDA to arrive at a TP of INR14,200. Reiterate BUY,” it added. UltraTech Cement share price: UltraTech Cement shares have gained more than 7 percent in the past one month, and over 6 percent in 2026 so far. Follow all LIVE updates from the stock markets here."
"Kotak Mahindra Bank shares tumble 5% after Q3 results miss estimates: Should you buy, sell or hold?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/kotak-mahindra-bank-shares-tumble-5-after-q3-results-miss-estimates-should-you-buy-sell-or-hold-13791546.html,"The shares of Kotak Mahindra Bank tumbled more than 5 percent on January 27 after the company released its results for the October-December quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026. Brokerages have mixed views for the stock, with some cutting forecasts after the lender’s earnings missed estimates. The shares of the heavyweight lender dropped to Rs 400.5 apiece, recording the sharpest single-day fall since July 2025. Kotak Mahindra Q3 Results: Kotak Mahindra Bank on January 24 reported a standalone net profit of Rs 3,446.14 crore for Q3 FY26. This marks a 4 percent year-on-year increase from the Rs 3,305 crore net profit reported in the same quarter of the previous financial year. The bank's results missed estimates, as analysts had expected a profit of Rs 3,572 crore, according to data compiled by LSEG. Net Interest Income (NII) increased more than 5 percent YoY to Rs 7,565 crore during the quarter under review, from Rs 7,196 crore a year ago. However, net interest margin (NIM) declined to 4.54 percent from 4.93 percent in the third quarter of the previous financial year. Asset quality slightly improved sequentially, with gross non-performing asset (NPA) ratio moderating to 1.30 percent as on December 31, 2025, from 1.50 percent a year ago. Net NPA also eased to 0.31 per cent from 0.41 per cent at the end of December 2024. HDFC Securities on Kotak Mahindra Bank: HDFC Securities noted that Kotak Mahindra Bank’s Q3 earnings were below estimates, as flattish margins, soft traction in fee income, and relatively high opex intensity was partly offset by higher growth on both sides of the balance sheet. “Healthy loan growth (16% YoY) was driven by mortgages, business banking, SME segments. Deposit growth (~14% YoY) was strong with CASA ratio at 41.3% (-101bps QoQ) and softer than usual traction in CA balances. While the stress in unsecured segments has largely abated, stress in retail CV segment remains elevated. We are constructive on KMB, expecting growth momentum to sustain in RoA-accretive segments such as LAP, CV/CE, tractors, business banking, and SME, concomitantly reshaping its unsecured segment strategy,” the domestic brokerage said. It cut the lender’s FY26E/FY27E earnings forecasts by 5/2 percent, factoring in softer margins and fee income. It maintained its ‘Buy’ rating for the stock, with a target price of Rs 495 apiece, implying an upside potential of more than 17 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. While growth is picking up, higher opex was seen after four quarters of managing it well, noted CLSA. Emkay meanwhile expects Kotak Mahindra Bank to report a relatively moderate RoA of 1.9 percent in FY26E, albeit with an improvement to 2 percent in FY27/FY28E as margins and loss -loss provisions normalize Motilal Oswal on Kotak Mahindra Bank: Motilal Oswal said the lender’s NII and other income stood largely in line with its estimates. Operating expenses came in higher than anticipated, while provisions were lower than estimates. “The decline in the unsecured portfolio has now been arrested, and the bank has reiterated its guidance for stronger growth in the coming quarters, which should also support margins. Overall loan growth is guided at 1.5-2.0x nominal GDP, driven by stable momentum in retail and unsecured segments. Given the continued growth traction, we believe the bank is well positioned to deliver a healthy ~16% loan CAGR over FY26-28E,” the domestic brokerage said. Motilal maintained its earnings estimate, along with a ‘Buy’ call on the stock with a target price of Rs 500 apiece. This implies an upside potential of more than 18 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. Kotak Mahindra Bank share price: Kotak Mahindra Bank shares have fallen more than 5 percent in the past one month, but gained around 4 percent in the past six months. The stock which currently has a P/E ratio of 22.50, is currently the top loser on benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty, as well as the Nifty Bank index.

"Adani group stocks rebound up to 5% after Friday’s rout; Adani Enterprises, Adani Ports among top Nifty gainers",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/adani-group-stocks-rebound-up-to-5-after-friday-s-rout-adani-enterprises-adani-ports-among-top-nifty-gainers-13791487.html,"Shares of Adani Group companies rebounded sharply by up to 5 percent in early trade on Tuesday, January 27, with Adani Enterprises and Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone emerging among the top gainers on the Nifty. The recovery in Adani group stocks today follows a steep selloff in the previous session triggered by US regulatory developments. Adani Enterprises shares rose nearly 5 percent to around Rs 1,955, while Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone gained over 4 percent to Rs 1,363, placing both stocks among the top of the Nifty gainers’ list in morning trade. The rebound follows a sharp decline on Friday, January 23, when Adani group stocks fell as much as 14 percent amid reports that the US Securities and Exchange Commission had sought court permission to serve legal summons on billionaire Gautam Adani and group executive Sagar Adani. Other Adani group stocks also traded higher on Tuesday. Adani Green Energy advanced nearly 4 percent to about Rs 802, Adani Energy Solutions rose close to 4 percent to around Rs 844, and Adani Power was up over 2 percent at roughly Rs 136. Earlier, on January 23, Adani Enterprises had closed nearly 11 percent lower, its lowest level since May 19, 2023. Adani Green Energy stock had slumped more than 14 percent, while Adani Ports had ended the session down about 7 percent. Adani Energy Solutions had fallen 10 percent, marking its biggest single-day percentage drop since November 21, 2024. The selloff was sparked by reports that the SEC had asked a US court for permission to directly email summons to Gautam Adani and Sagar Adani in connection with an alleged fraud and a USD 265 million bribery scheme. According to Reuters, the SEC told the court that it did not expect service to be completed through existing channels after India declined two earlier requests to serve the summons. Adani Group has rejected the allegations, calling them “baseless”, and has said it would pursue “all possible legal recourse”. In June, Gautam Adani had stated that “despite all the noise”, no one from the Adani Group had been charged with violating the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or conspiring to obstruct justice. Separately, Adani Enterprises informed stock exchanges that it is not a party to the legal proceedings referenced in recent media reports and that the matter does not trigger any disclosure requirements under India’s listing regulations. Responding to queries from BSE and NSE following a media report, the company said there are “no allegations made against the Company” and that it is not involved in the proceedings cited. It added that the reported developments do not have any bearing on its disclosure or compliance obligations under SEBI regulations.

"Hindustan Zinc shares jump 5% as silver's March futures cross Rs 3.5 lakh/kg on MCX, silver ETFs surge up to 12%",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/hindustan-zinc-shares-jump-5-as-silver-s-march-futures-cross-rs-3-5-lakh-kg-on-mcx-silver-etfs-surge-up-to-12-13791414.html,"The shares of Hindustan Zinc jumped around 5 percent on January 27 as silver prices extended their record bull run, rushing to fresh lifetime highs. Silver ETFs also mirrored the sharp surge in the precious metals. Hindustan Zinc shares hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs 733 apiece in the early trading hours of Tuesday. The Vedanta Group-company is the largest producer of silver in India, and produces refined silver with a minimum 99.9 percent purity. Silver prices soar to fresh lifetime highs: Silver futures on MCX with March expiry jumped more than 7 percent to hit a fresh lifetime high of Rs 3,59,800 per kilogram. The future contracts with May and July expiries also surged to new all-time highs of Rs 3,75,261 per kg and Rs 3,82,940 per kg, respectively. Spot silver surged 5.2 percent to $109.22 an ounce, after hitting a record high of $117.69 ​on Monday. The white metal has already surged 53% ‍so far this year. ""Trump's disruptive policy approach this year is playing into the hands of ​precious metals as a defensive play. The threats of higher tariffs to Canada and South Korea are doing enough to keep gold a safe-haven choice,"" said Reuters quoted Tim Waterer, KCM Trade's chief market ‍analyst, as saying. US President Donald Trump on Monday said he would raise tariffs on South Korean autos, lumber, and pharmaceuticals imports to 25 percent, criticizing Seoul for failing to enact a trade deal with Washington. This came after he threatened tariffs on Canada. The tariff flip-flops have significantly boosted the precious metals. Silver ETFs: Silver exchange traded funds (ETFs) saw significant surge today, as the precious and industrial metal soared. Nippon India Silver ETF (Silverbees) jumped nearly 10 percent to hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs 321.48 apiece. Groww Silver ETF also gained around 10 percent. Zerodha Silver ETF gained more than 11 percent to a new record high of Rs 34.7 apiece. HDFC Silver ETF meanwhile surged more than 12 percent. UTI Silver ETF, Aditya Birla Sun Life Silver ETF, Tata Silver ETF, ICICI Pru Silver ETF, DSP Silver ETF, Motilal Oswal Silver ETF, Axis Silver ETF and others also gained sharply. Should you buy silver ETFs at these levels? For those looking at fresh investment, the main risk right now is valuation and sentiment, said Ross Maxwell, Global Strategy Operations Lead at VT Markets. He added that silver is far more volatile than gold, and sharp rallies are often followed by equally sharp corrections once speculative interest cools. ""Entering at current highs could expose new investors to near-term drawdowns if prices consolidate or retrace sharply. A better approach for those who still want exposure is to use dollar cost averaging strategies, entering in small, staggered allocations that average out entry costs and reduce timing risk,"" he said. For investors planning to exit their positions, Maxwell said that if silver was added as a tactical hedge or short-term trade, then this is a sensible area to book at least partial profits. ""Locking in gains and rebalancing back to target asset allocation helps protect against sudden reversals, which are common in precious metals,"" he said. However, investors with a longer-term view who believe in structural drivers like industrial demand and tight supply may choose to continue holding a core position, the expert added. ""This is not an ideal price for large fresh investments, and partial profit-taking for current holders is a rational risk-management move rather than a full exit,"" he explained.

"Axis Bank shares jump nearly 4% today after Q3 results, brokerages bullish; check target prices",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/axis-bank-shares-jump-nearly-4-today-after-q3-results-brokerages-bullish-check-target-prices-13791306.html,"Shares of Axis Bank Ltd jumped nearly 4 percent in early trade on Tuesday, January 27, after the private sector lender reported a better-than-expected results for Q3 FY26. The strong financial performance drew a string of bullish brokerage responses on earnings visibility, asset quality and valuations. Axis Bank stock was trading at Rs 1,306.6, up 3.86 percent, extending its strong run over the past year. The stock has gained 37.3 percent over the last 12 months, sharply outperforming the Nifty 50, which is up about 9.7 percent over the same period. Axis Bank Q3 results beat estimates Axis Bank reported a 3 percent year-on-year rise in net profit to Rs 6,489.6 crore for Q3 FY26, beating the CNBC-TV18 poll estimate of Rs 6,046 crore. Net interest income grew 5 percent on-year to Rs 14,286.4 crore, also ahead of Street expectations, reflecting steady core lending performance. Asset quality improved sequentially, with gross NPAs easing to 1.40 percent from 1.46 percent in the September quarter and net NPAs declining to 0.42 percent from 0.44 percent. In absolute terms, gross NPAs fell quarter-on-quarter, while net NPAs edged up marginally. Axis Bank stock call: Brokerages turn more bullish Brokerages were largely positive on the stock outlook, citing improving credit cost visibility, resilient profitability metrics and attractive valuations. Citi upgraded Axis Bank to a ‘Buy’ and raised its target price to Rs 1,436, implying an upside of over 14 percent. Citi highlighted another core earnings beat and return on assets of around 1.5 percent. The brokerage flagged stable slippages despite agricultural seasonality, lower-than-expected credit costs and improved cost efficiency, even as treasury gains and fee income remained muted. CLSA maintained its ‘Outperform’ rating with a target price of Rs 1,500, calling asset quality the key highlight of the quarter. It noted that excluding technical slippages, gross slippages declined sharply on-year, driven by unsecured retail credit, while credit costs came in below estimates. Bernstein, which has an ‘Outperform’ rating and a target of Rs 1,480, described the quarter as mixed, with healthy loan and deposit growth offset by margin pressure and elevated credit costs. Still, it said return on assets was sustained at around 1.5 percent. Nomura reiterated its ‘Buy’ call with a target price of Rs 1,540, pointing to improving credit cost visibility and strengthening growth trends. The brokerage expects return on assets of 1.7-1.8 percent and return on equity of around 15 percent over FY27-28, with earnings CAGR estimated at 26 percent. HSBC also maintained a ‘Buy’ rating, setting a target price of Rs 1,580, and said the upgrade thesis was playing out as expected, supported by sharp improvement in credit costs and strong growth and margin performance. Jefferies retained its ‘Buy’ call with a target of Rs 1,550, citing a profit beat driven by stronger topline, lower credit costs and controlled operating expenses.

"Asian stocks dip on Korea tariffs, Yen holds gains",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/asian-stocks-dip-on-korea-tariffs-yen-holds-gains-13790952.html,"Asian equities edged lower as tariff concerns resurfaced after President Donald Trump threatened to raise levies on South Korean goods. The yen held its gains. The Kospi Index, one of the world’s best-performing benchmarks this year, fell 0.9%, while the South Korean won weakened after four days of gains. Japanese shares fell for a second day, weighed down by a stronger yen. The yen traded near around 154 per dollar after gaining on the greenback over the past two sessions amid speculation the US may coordinate intervention with Japan. A gauge of the dollar was steady Tuesday, hovering around levels last seen in 2022. Gold and silver also traded near their record highs on Tuesday. While much of the market’s focus has been on currencies and the risk of yen intervention, tariff concerns have also resurfaced after Trump warned of 100% levies on Canada. The added uncertainty comes in a pivotal week for investors, with megacap technology earnings set to test whether the artificial-intelligence driven rally can be sustained. “Tech has become more of a show-me story,” said Darrell Cronk, chief investment officer for wealth and investment management at Wells Fargo, which manages $2.3 trillion. “If Big Tech can continue to deliver, I think capital will start flowing in tech’s direction again.” In the US, companies accounting for roughly a third of the S&P 500’s market capitalization report this week. The US president has ratcheted up trade tensions with several allies in recent weeks, threatening to raise duties on Canadian products to 100% if Ottawa signed a trade deal with China. Trump attributed a 25% tariff hike on South Korean goods to the country’s legislature failing to codify a trade agreement reached with the US last year. Trump had earlier threatened to slap new charges on European countries’ goods over his quest to seize control of Greenland. He then backed off. Meanwhile, the yen’s gains remained in focus after comments from Japanese officials fueled speculation that the government may intervene in the market to prevent the currency from resuming its slide. To some, however, the recent rally has partly neutralized the likelihood of intervention. “The dramatic recovery in the yen suggests that actual intervention is not needed,” said Marc Chandler at Bannockburn Capital Markets. Elsewhere, US power grids are under mounting pressure following a winter storm that unleashed deep cold and heavy snow and ice from Texas to Maine. That’s knocked an estimated 12% of US natural gas production off-line and forecasts for frigid weather caused prices to soar. US natural gas prices jumped around 30%. Treasuries remained in a narrow range on Monday with the Federal Reserve expected to pause its rate cuts when it announces its policy on Wednesday. Fed officials are expected to hold rates steady following three straight cuts at the end of 2025, as a steadier jobs market restores a degree of consensus at the central bank after months of growing division. Chair Jerome Powell is likely to telegraph his view that policy is well-positioned for now, but refrain from signaling much about where rates are headed. Expectations about Fed policy have been shifting in response to changes in the consensus view on whom Trump will nominate to succeed Powell, whose term expires in May. “Even though the Fed isn’t expected to cut interest rates, Powell’s press conference may be as much about Fed independence as it is policy,” said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley."

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Hindustan Unilever, Shriram Finance, Union Bank of India, Tech Mahindra, Max Financial Services, and others on January 27?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-hindustan-unilever-shriram-finance-union-bank-of-india-tech-mahindra-max-financial-services-and-others-on-january-27-13790719.html,"Equity benchmarks slipped nearly 1 percent on January 23, with the Nifty 50 now trading below all key moving averages. Market breadth was favourable for bears, with about 2,233 shares declining against 702 advancing shares on the NSE. Consolidation with range-bound trading is expected to continue over the next few sessions. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Rajesh Palviya, Senior Vice President Research (Head Technical Derivatives) at Axis Securities Tech Mahindra | CMP: Rs 1,701.1  On the daily and weekly charts, Tech Mahindra is trending higher, forming a series of higher tops and bottoms, indicating a short- to medium-term uptrend. On the weekly chart, the stock has confirmed a down-sloping trendline breakout at the Rs 1,640 level along with huge volumes, indicating increased participation. The stock is well placed above its 20-, 50-, 100- and 200-day SMA, which reconfirms the bullish trend. The daily, weekly and monthly strength RSI is in positive territory, signalling rising strength. The daily and weekly Bollinger Band signals indicate increased price movement. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,800, Rs 1,850 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,640 Bank of India | CMP: 159.65  On the weekly chart, Bank of India has confirmed a “multiple resistance” breakout at the Rs 154 level on a closing basis, along with huge volumes, which signifies bullish sentiment. The stock is well placed above its 20-, 50-, 100- and 200-day SMA, and these averages are also inching up along with rising prices, which reconfirms a bullish trend. The weekly and monthly strength RSI is in positive territory, signalling rising strength. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 180, Rs 185 Stop-Loss: Rs 154 PG Electroplast | CMP: Rs 510.35  On the daily and weekly charts, PG Electroplast is in a downtrend, forming a series of lower tops and bottom formations. It has also decisively broken a 5–6 month up-sloping trendline on a closing basis, along with huge volumes, indicating selling pressure. The stock is sustaining below its 50-, 100- and 200-day SMAs, which reconfirms a short-term downtrend. The daily, weekly and monthly strength indicator RSI remains weak, indicating continued weakness in the recent downturn. Investors should consider exiting long positions as well as initiating fresh shorts in this stock. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 470, Rs 450 Stop-Loss: Rs 550 Rajesh Bhosale, Technical Analyst at Angel One Hindustan Unilever | CMP: Rs 2,409.50  While the benchmark index Nifty ended the week with a decline of around 2.5 percent, Hindustan Unilever acted as a defensive outperformer, gaining nearly 2 percent during the week and exhibiting strong relative strength. On the daily chart, prices are forming a bullish Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern and are placed above all major moving averages, which supports the buy view. Additionally, the smoothened RSI has generated a fresh buy signal, with a bullish crossover above its signal line on both the daily and weekly charts. Hence, we recommend buying Hindustan Unilever in the range of Rs 2,410–2,400. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,550 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,330 Max Financial Services | CMP: Rs 1,599  Max Financial Services has been trading in a range over the past three months and, after failing to cross the Rs 1,750 mark on two occasions, has now breached key support levels, confirming a topping-out formation in the form of a Double Top. Prices have also slipped below the crucial 89 DEMA, which earlier acted as support and now signals a change in polarity. On the indicator front, the RSI remains in the negative zone, further reinforcing the sell view. Hence, we recommend selling Max Financial Services around Rs 1,595. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 1,500 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,640 Anshul Jain, Head of Research at Lakshmishree Investments Shriram Finance | CMP: Rs 1,003.55  Shriram Finance is forming a classic pole-and-flag structure on the daily chart, with the flag marked by low-volume sideways consolidation between Rs 961 and Rs 1,025.6. The contraction reflects healthy digestion after a strong impulsive pole, not distribution. Institutional volumes during the pole were clearly accumulative, lending credibility to the continuation setup. A pre-emptive long around Rs 1,003 offers a front-running opportunity with a favourable risk–reward ratio ahead of confirmation. However, real momentum acceleration will only emerge on a decisive breakout above Rs 1,025. A sustained breach of this ceiling is likely to unleash sharp follow-through buying, projecting an initial upside toward the Rs 1,100 zone. Until then, the flag structure remains constructive, with dips likely to be absorbed rather than sold. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,100 Stop-Loss: Rs 960 Bank of Maharashtra | CMP: Rs 65.63  Bank of Maharashtra is on the verge of resolving a powerful 371-day rounding base, with a very shallow handle making it a textbook cup-and-handle structure. The base has seen clear institutional accumulation, while the right-side development shows tight price action with sharply dried-up volumes, signalling calm before expansion. This contraction reflects absorption, not supply. The breakout pivot is precisely placed at Rs 67.63, and a decisive breach with follow-through would confirm momentum ignition. Given the strength of the base, the move is likely to be fast and directional. On confirmation, the stock can propel toward the Rs 78–79 zone initially. With a pre-budget tailwind building across PSU banking names, the risk–reward favours an upside resolution, while failure to clear the pivot would only delay, not negate, the broader bullish structure. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 79 Stop-Loss: Rs 62 Union Bank of India | CMP: Rs 172.77  Union Bank of India has delivered a decisive breakout from a massive 2,002-day VCP (Volume Contraction Pattern) structure, marking a major long-term trend shift. Post breakout, the stock has paused into an eight-day tight flag, acting as a pit stop rather than exhaustion. This brief consolidation has allowed short-term indicators and momentum to cool off without damaging the structure. Moving averages across daily and weekly charts remain bullishly aligned and continue to act as a launchpad. The setup signals stored energy ahead of expansion. A clean breakout and sustain above Rs 176 would trigger the next momentum leg, opening an initial move toward Rs 189. Beyond that, the multi-year high near Rs 220 becomes the next logical zone where profit booking may emerge. Until then, the structure favours continuation over consolidation. Strategy: Buy Target; Rs 189, Rs 220 Stop-Loss: Rs 164"
Mining stocks in Asia gain as hard-asset trade gathers pace,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/mining-stocks-in-asia-gain-as-hard-asset-trade-gathers-pace-13790369.html,"Asian mining stocks climbed with metals prices as investors rotated into hard assets, driven by a weakening dollar and growing unease over currencies, geopolitics and global fiscal risks. A group of materials producers led gains Monday on MSCI Inc.’s broadest index of Asia Pacific equities. Korea Zinc Co. shares climbed as much as 14% in Seoul while Zhongjin Gold Corp.’s jumped 10% in Shanghai. Markets were closed for holidays Monday in Australia and India. The advances mirror a powerful rally in metals markets, where gold, silver, copper and aluminum are climbing on what traders describe as a debasement trade. Investors are pulling away from currencies and Treasuries, seeking refuge in hard assets as concerns mount over fiscal largesse, geopolitics and the durability of US exceptionalism.  The rally in metals “is a long term trend that we have been observing for several years,” said Frank Benzimra, head of Asia equity strategy at Societe Generale SA. Reasons include a diversification away from US assets and rising defense spending boosting demand for base metals as well as AI-related demand."
"Stock market holiday today: BSE, NSE to remain shut for Republic Day",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/stock-market-holiday-today-bse-nse-to-remain-shut-for-republic-day-13790229.html,"The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE) will remain closed on January 26 on account of Republic Day. Trading in equities, equity derivatives, securities lending and borrowing (SLBs), currency derivatives, and interest rate derivatives will remain shut for the day on both the BSE and the NSE. The commodity derivatives segment will also remain closed for the day. Trading on the NSE and the BSE will resume on January 27 (Tuesday). The market ended lower in a volatile session on January 23, as selling pressure was seen across sectors. At close, the Sensex was down 769.67 points or 0.94 percent at 81,537.70, and the Nifty was down 241.25 points or 0.95 percent at 25,048.65. The broader market underperformed the benchmarks, with the BSE midcap index falling 1.5 percent and the smallcap index down over 2 percent. Biggest Nifty losers were Adani Enterprises, Adani Ports, Eternal, Interglobe Aviation, Cipla, while gainers included Dr Reddy's Labs, Tech Mahindra, ONGC, Hindalco, HUL. All the sectoral indices ended in the red with capital goods, power, realty, PSU Bank, and media down 2-3%. ""After showing a bounce back in the last couple of sessions, Nifty slipped into sharp weakness on Friday and closed the day lower by 241 points. After opening on a positive note, the market was not able to sustain the opening gains and started with weakness in the early part of the session. The weakness intensified in the mid to later part, and Nifty finally closed at the lows,"" said Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities. ""A long bear candle was formed on the daily chart, which indicates a formation of a lower top reversal pattern at the recent swing highs of 25400 levels. Nifty on the weekly chart formed a long bear candle this week after the minor bounce of last week. The overall chart pattern remains negative, and one may expect Nifty to slide below the recent low of 24900 by next week. The near-term downside target to be watched is around 24,600. Immediate resistance is placed at 25200 levels,"" he added. On Friday, the Indian rupee ended at a record low at 91.96 per dollar versus Thursday's close of 91.62. ""The Indian rupee succumbed to a record low, bucking under the weight of voracious dollar demand from importers and corporates ahead of the long weekend and the upcoming Union Budget,"" said Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities. ""This fragility intensified as domestic equities faced a fresh bout of liquidation, erasing Thursday’s tentative recovery."" ""The outlook for spot USDINR remains resolutely bullish; we anticipate the pair may eclipse the psychological 92 threshold while finding the support at 91.10,"" he said.

Broader indices log biggest weekly decline in 4 months; over 200 small-caps see double-digit losses,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/broader-indices-log-biggest-weekly-decline-in-4-months-over-200-small-caps-see-double-digit-losses-13789275.html,"Broader indices fell 4–6 percent, logging their biggest weekly decline in four months and underperforming the benchmark indices amid mixed earnings from India Inc, continued foreign investor outflows, and the rupee hitting a fresh low. The BSE Sensex declined 769.67 points, or 2.43 percent, to close at 81,537.70, while the Nifty50 shed 241.25 points, or 2.51 percent, to end at 25,048.65. So far this month, the BSE Sensex and Nifty50 have each declined 4 percent, while the BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices have fallen 5.7 percent and 9 percent, respectively. All the sectoral indices gave negative return with Nifty Realty shed more than 11 percent, Nifty Consumer Durables index slipped 6.5 percent, Nifty Media plunged 4 percent, Nifty Oil & Gas, Energy, Infra, Defence, Healthcare fell 3 percent each. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) offloaded equities worth Rs 14,651.99 crore during the period, while Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) offset the selling with purchases worth Rs 20,746 crore. ""Indian equity markets remained cautious and volatile through the week, pressured by renewed global trade tensions and continued foreign investor outflows. Fresh U.S. tariff threats against European nations linked to the Greenland issue dampened global risk appetite, prompting a shift toward safe-haven assets. Moreover, rising global bond yields and uncertainty surrounding the U.S. Supreme Court’s review of Trump-era tariffs further restrained risk-taking,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments. ""Corporate earnings reinforced the mixed sentiment, as weaker results from leading banking and IT companies tempered market enthusiasm, although selective value buying offered intermittent support. While global cues briefly improved following constructive remarks from the U.S. President on the Greenland issue, the domestic market’s rebound was short-lived, highlighting the persistence of external headwinds for India."" ""Market direction in the coming week is likely to be driven by global macroeconomic signals and domestic fiscal expectations. Investors will closely track guidance from the Fed on the trajectory of interest rate cuts, while positioning may be influenced by anticipation surrounding the Union Budget, particularly any measures aimed at easing external trade pressures and supporting capital flows,"" Nair said. ""With the Q3 earnings season still underway, stock-specific movements are expected to remain prominent. Overall sentiment is likely to stay cautious, shaped by global developments, currency trends, and earnings outcomes, with selective opportunities emerging in segments supported by resilient domestic demand,"" he added. The BSE Small-cap index declined shed nearly 6 percent with Best Agrolife, Sudarshan Colorants India, Wardwizard Innovations and Mobility, Systematix Corporate Services, Ajmera Realty and Infra India, Sigachi Industries, Wanbury, OneSource Specialty Pharma, IIFL Finance, Jayaswal Neco Industries, Ramco System, Authum Investment & Infrastucture, Arisinfra Solutions, Bigbloc Construction falling between 17-25 percent, while gainers included Dhampur Bio Organics, Lotus Chocolate Company, Baazar Style Retail, Jindal Saw, Shanthi Gears, Mercury Ev-Tech.  Where is Nifty50 headed? Hitesh Tailor, Research Analyst, Choice Equity Broking The 81,000–81,100 zone is emerging as a crucial support area for the Sensex, acting as a cushion where dip-buying interest may surface if weakness deepens. On the upside, 82,000–82,100 stands as the immediate resistance band, where any short-term rebound is likely to encounter supply pressure and profit booking. With the index ending decisively below recent intermediate levels and broad-based selling dominating the session, the near-term bias remains cautious to bearish. Selective accumulation may be considered only if the key support zone holds and clear buying interest re-emerges."" Amol Athawale, VP – Technical Research We are of the view that as long as the market trades below the 100-day SMA or 25500/83000, the weak formation is likely to continue. On the downside, 24900/81100 would act as an immediate support zone. Below this level, selling pressure is likely to accelerate. Further below, the market could slip to 24700,–24,500/80500-80000. On the upside, above 25,200/82000, we could see a quick pullback up to 25,350–25,500/82500-83000. For Bank Nifty, 58,000 would act as a key level for traders. Below this, the correction wave is likely to continue until 57,500–57100. Conversely, above 59,000, it could bounce back up to 59,350–59,500. Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities After showing a bounce back in the last couple of sessions, Nifty slipped into sharp weakness on Friday and closed the day lower by 241 points. After opening on a positive note, the market was not able to sustain the opening gains and started with weakness since early part of the session. The weakness got intensified in the mid to later part and Nifty finally closed at the lows. A long bear candle was formed on the daily chart which indicates a formation of lower top reversal pattern at the recent swing highs of 25400 levels. Nifty on the weekly chart formed a long bear candle this week after the minor bounce of last week. The overall chart pattern remains negative and one may expect Nifty sliding below the recent low of 24900 by next week. The near-term downside target to be watched around 24600. Immediate resistance is placed at 25200 levels. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The index remained weak throughout the session as it stayed below the 20 EMA on the hourly chart. In addition, the index has finally slipped below the 200 DMA on a closing basis, suggesting capitulation by the bulls after a futile attempt to defend the crucial long-term moving average. As a result, short- to medium-term sentiment is likely to remain weak as long as the index trades below 25,500. On the downside, the decline could extend toward 24,700 in the short term.

"Dow ends lower after topsy-turvy week, as Intel's outlook weighs on market sentiment",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/dow-ends-lower-after-topsy-turvy-week-as-intel-s-outlook-weighs-on-market-sentiment-13789249.html,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down ​on Friday, while the S&P 500 ended largely unchanged, as investors' risk appetite was dimmed at the end of a topsy-turvy week ‌by Intel's plunge on a downbeat outlook. All three Wall Street benchmarks had rebounded in the past two sessions following Tuesday's sharp selloff triggered by U.S. President Donald Trump's threats to impose tariffs on European allies, an effort to pressure them to accept his claims to Greenland. On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 285.30 points, or 0.58%, to 49,098.71. The S&P 500 edged up 2.26 points, or 0.03%, to 6,915.61, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 65.23 points, or 0.28%, to 23,501.24. Even the Nasdaq's ‌Friday gains were not enough to rescue the benchmarks from having a down week, with the S&P 500 off by ​0.36%, the Dow lower by 0.53% and the Nasdaq slipping by 0.06%. Despite the week's limited pullback, investors appeared to remain confident that while geopolitical-induced volatility is a present danger, the overall state of the American economy continues to be robust. ""When we think about what it means from an investor's standpoint, we feel ‍pretty good about where we are today,"" said Jason Blackwell, chief investment strategist at Focus Partners Wealth. He noted that volatility was expected this year, given the midterms later in 2026. However, corporate earnings are expected to continue to come in strong, and the economy is going along fine. ""We're feeling pretty good, but mindful we might have some significant twists and ⁠turns throughout the rest of the year,"" Blackwell added. THE 'SHOW-ME' SEASON One twist on Friday, which weighed on market sentiment, was chipmaker Intel (INTC.O), opens new tab. Its shares sank 17% after the ‍company forecast quarterly revenue and profit below market estimates, saying it struggled to satisfy demand for its server chips used in AI data centers. With many technology and semiconductor companies ‌still trading ‌at sky-high valuations, 2026 is viewed by many as the year where the huge excitement for the artificial intelligence trend, and the huge amounts of capital expenditure to attain it, need to start showing up as corporate revenue. Julian McManus, portfolio manager on the Global Alpha Equity team at Janus Henderson, noted how last week's earnings from TSMC(2330.TW), opens new tab, the world's main producer of advanced AI chips, could portend well for the latest earnings from the space. “Going into results, we’re going to be ⁠in a ‘show-me’ period, where you have ⁠to actually put up the revenue ​growth to justify the run-up in stocks,” he said. “It’s going to be a period of the haves versus the have-nots, and I personally don’t see Intel being in the haves.” MAG 7 EARNINGS TEST This show-me point will be particularly pertinent for investors next week, with earnings on deck from many of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks, including Apple, Tesla ‍and Microsoft. On Friday, most of the megacaps rose, with Microsoft, Meta and Amazon up between 1.7% and 3.3%.

"US hedge fund picks up additional 1.5% stake in Antony Waste Handling Cell; Plutus Wealth pares take in Ecos India, Rategain Travel",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/us-hedge-fund-picks-up-additional-1-5-stake-in-antony-waste-handling-cell-plutus-wealth-pares-take-in-ecos-india-rategain-travel-13789041.html,"US hedge fund Miri Strategic Emerging Markets Fund has acquired additional 1.49 percent equity stake in Antony Waste Handling Cell, the municipal solid waste management company, via open market transactions on January 23. Antony Waste Handling Cell shares soared 13.8 percent to close at four-month high of Rs 570.75 amid high volumes, decisively surpassing above all key moving averages in a single session. US-based Miri Capital Management-owned Miri Strategic Emerging Markets Fund has bought 4.23 lakh shares (equivalent to 1.49 percent of paid-up equity) at Rs 563.94 per share for Rs 23.87 crore. Last week, the said US hedge fund picked up 3 lakh shares (1.05 percent stake), in addition to 1.14 percent shares held as of December 2025. The action continued in FMCG company Bajaj Consumer Care as its shares gained 3 percent to finish at Rs 305.8 in addition to 20 percent rally in previous session. Hill Fort India Fund, a Mauritius-based FPI founded by Puneet Saraogi, bought 9.69 lakh shares (0.7 percent stake) in the company at Rs 299.94 per share, valued at Rs 29.06 crore. In previous session, BNP Paribas Financial Markets bought 0.73 percent shares in Bajaj Consumer Care.

"Cipla takes wait‑and‑watch call on weight loss generic semaglutide, to focus on tirzepatide",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/cipla-takes-wait-and-watch-call-on-weight-loss-generic-semaglutide-to-focus-on-tirzepatide-13788957.html,"Cipla Ltd. on Friday said it will take a “wait‑and‑watch” approach on entering the diabetes and weight loss therapy semaglutide market even as rivals prepare for generic launches, as the company prioritises its partnership with Eli Lilly for tirzepatide, which it considers the superior obesity and diabetes therapy. “Our current focus remains on tirzepatide in terms of being the best‑in‑class molecule,” said Achin Gupta, Cipla’s Managing Director and Global CEO (Designate). “We have possibilities to explore on Sema (semaglutide), but we would rather wait and watch and see how the market plays out, especially at lower price points once genericisation happens.” Cipla launched Yurpeak (tirzepatide) in India under a partnership with Eli Lilly to treat type 2 diabetes and chronic weight management. Eli Lilly manufactures and supplies the product, while Cipla manages marketing and distribution. Cipla is working on expanding the coverage beyond major cities, with pricing in line with Mounjaro. “Yurpeak is a massive opportunity for us,” Gupta said. “Since we believe that is the best‑in‑class product out there and is under patent for a long time, at the moment we’re focusing maximum energies on that.” In its first month (December 2025), the Yurpeak has recorded sales of Rs.14 crore, performing well in tier-2 and 3 markets. Cipla decision to go slow on semaglutide, contrast with rivals Dr.Reddy's and Sun Pharma, who got regulatory approval in India for launching generic versions of semaglutide. Both companies announced that they will be launching generic Ozempic in March, following the patent expiry of the drug. Analysts expect the generic would be cheaper by 50-60 percent than branded drug. US dragged by lenalidomide cliff, lanreotide supply issues The drugmaker posted a lacklustre performance in its US business due to a sharp drop in anti-cancer generic lenalidomide sales and supply disruptions in lanreotide. Cipla’s North America, which consists largely US, reported around 26% drop YoY to $167 million in Q3FY26, as lenalidomide contributions dwindled sharply and lanreotide supplies were disrupted after an USFDA audit hit its partner Pharmathen. Gupta acknowledged the drag openly. “We had a small contribution from lenalidomide in Q3, and lanreotide faced supply challenges following the USFDA audit of our partner,” he said. “In the meantime, the product will be in limited supplies… but we are working on enabling an alternate site together with the partner.” The supply issues will spill into next quarter as well, the company said. Gupta described US performance as a “temporary” setback that will be offset by upcoming high‑value launches, particularly in respiratory and peptides. “There are two respiratory assets where we believe we could have a sole‑generic opportunity, and these are pretty sizable,” he said. “Our pipeline gives us the confidence to offset lenalidomide and deliver strong growth.” Complex generics over volume play Cipla plans to lean further into complex, high‑margin launches — including long‑acting injectables and peptides — to rebuild momentum in the US. “We focus a lot on the value and complexity of launches rather than the number of filings,” Gupta said. “This will help us make up for the loss.” He reiterated that filgrastim in the US is a “small entry” and more of a capability‑building step in biosimilars."

Click to View More Outlook for January 27 Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The index remained weak throughout the session as it stayed below the 20 EMA on the hourly chart. In addition, the index has finally slipped below the 200 DMA on a closing basis, suggesting capitulation by the bulls after a futile attempt to defend the crucial long-term moving average. As a result, short- to medium-term sentiment is likely to remain weak as long as the index trades below 25,500. On the downside, the decline could extend toward 24,700 in the short term. Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets remained volatile and declined nearly one percent, resuming the prevailing corrective trend. The Nifty index opened in positive territory on easing geopolitical tensions but soon gave up its gains and drifted lower amid persistent selling pressure, eventually settling near the day’s low at 25,048.65. Selling was broad-based, with realty, energy and banking stocks among the key laggards, while only a few defensive and select cyclical names provided limited support. Broader market indices also mirrored the weakness, with midcap and smallcap indices falling close to two percent each, highlighting widespread risk-off positioning and cautious participation. Market sentiment was weighed down by renewed concerns over global trade and geopolitical developments, along with continued foreign institutional selling. Currency weakness further added to the negative bias, as the Indian rupee slipped to fresh lows against the US dollar during the session. In the absence of strong domestic triggers, trading remained largely stock-specific, marked by selective buying and pronounced selling across the broader market. Technically, the Nifty has slipped below its long-term moving average, the 200 DEMA, which signals the possibility of further downside. The 24,750–24,900 zone now emerges as the next key support area, while the 25,300–25,400 zone is likely to act as an immediate hurdle in case of any rebound. That said, select pockets continue to show resilience and are offering buying opportunities. In this environment, participants are advised to maintain a selective and balanced approach, take positions on both sides based on sectoral strength and weakness, and keep a strict check on position sizing. Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities After showing a bounce back in the last couple of sessions, Nifty slipped into sharp weakness on Friday and closed the day lower by 241 points. After opening on a positive note, the market was not able to sustain the opening gains and started with weakness since early part of the session. The weakness got intensified in the mid to later part and Nifty finally closed at the lows. A long bear candle was formed on the daily chart which indicates a formation of lower top reversal pattern at the recent swing highs of 25400 levels. Nifty on the weekly chart formed a long bear candle this week after the minor bounce of last week. The overall chart pattern remains negative and one may expect Nifty sliding below the recent low of 24900 by next week. The near-term downside target to be watched around 24600. Immediate resistance is placed at 25200 levels. Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Zee5 turned EBITDA positive this quarter, reporting EBITDA of INR 564mn. Other sales and services grew 6x YoY, driven by distribution income from Kantara 2 and Akhanda 2. TV market share gain of 60bps YoY remained a key positive for the linear TV segment. Advertising revenue declined 9% YoY, primarily due to continued FMCG softness, though it improved 6% QoQ. Management expects advertising recovery to be gradual driven by GST cuts and a pickup in brand-building initiatives by FMCG players. While the stock remains inexpensive at current market prices, we believe a tangible recovery in advertising income is crucial for re-rating. Outlook We maintain BUY with a revised TP of INR 120 (INR 185), based on an 18x one-year forward P/E multiple (FY27E).

It had a major disruption in first week of Dec’25 when there were operational challenges but the recovery has been well chartered as of now (refer Exhibit 1). Guidance for 10% volume growth in Q4FY26 YoY will also imply ASK in Q4 to be 2% higher QoQ which becomes important to note in this aspect. Spreads are expected to get a boost from steady crude price, better cost absorption on higher volume/lower damp leases in FY27. However, CASK ex-fuel remains under pressure driven by weakening INR and is a risk. Increasing importance of spreads in international business (most growth continues to come from international segment) will also be key. Basis guidance, we believe IndiGo could clock ~INR 20bn PAT in Q4FY26E ex of forex.

Average EBITDA run-rate for last four quarters is at INR 68bn vs. last 14 quarters’ avg. of INR 43.8bn; we see similar trends for Q4FY26–H1FY27E, helped by higher GRMs, Vizag residual commissioning (incremental USD2-2.5/bbl benefit) and steady retail margins.

Paytm shares fall 10% to see biggest single-day fall in over one year. Is this RBI decision to be blamed?,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/paytm-shares-fall-10-to-see-biggest-single-day-fall-in-over-one-year-is-this-rbi-decision-to-be-blamed-13788191.html,"The shares of Paytm dropped nearly 10 percent on January 23, falling to a three-month low level. The stock has now fallen around 15 percent in the past five days. The shares of the fintech platform dropped to Rs 1,134.50 apiece, the lowest level seen since October 1 last year. The stock has now recorded the worst single-day drop since January 2025. Why are Paytm shares falling today? One of the reasons why Paytm shares saw strong downturn today could be concerns around Payment Infrastructure Development Fund (PIDF) that was extended until December 2025, according to CNBC-TV18. The initiative by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) aimed to encourage deployment of digital payments acceptance infrastructure like soundboxes and POS devices, through incentives. Notably there has been no update yet as to whether the scheme will be extended beyond 2025. Paytm can see an impact of nearly Rs 200 crore in annualised operating revenue if the scheme is not extended, a hit that would directly impact the fintech giant’s EBITDA, NDTV Profit reported. Here's what Paytm said: After the shares saw strong volatility following the reports, Paytm issued a clarification. It said that it received Rs 128 crore as incentive under the scheme for the six months ended September 30, 2025. Paytm acknowledged that no announcement regarding the extension of the scheme has been made yet. ""In the scenario that the current Scheme is not extended or replaced, we expect to significantly offset the impact over time through a combination of higher revenues and more targeted sales efforts,"" it added. Paytm quarterly results: Paytm is set to release its results for the October-December quarter (Q3) of the ongoing financial year 2026 on January 29. Earlier in November, Paytm reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 21 crore for the quarter ended September 2025 (Q2 FY26), marking a sharp decline from Rs 930 crore in the same period last year due to a one-time gain of Rs 1,345 crore in the base quarter. Revenue from operations rose 24 percent year-on-year to Rs 2,061 crore and 7 percent higher quarter-on-quarter from Rs 1,918 crore in Q1 FY26, driven by sustained growth in financial services and merchant payments. Paytm share price: Paytm shares have declined more than 16 percent in the past one month, but gained over 7 percent in the past six months. This comes after the stock gained over 34 percent in the past one year. Follow all LIVE updates from the stock markets here."

"Real estate stocks see biggest weekly drop in 11 months, led by DLF, Anant Raj; Nuvama flags weak pre-sales as concern",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/real-estate-stocks-see-biggest-weekly-drop-in-11-months-led-by-dlf-anant-raj-nuvama-flags-weak-pre-sales-as-concern-13787910.html,"Shares of real estate firms recorded their steepest weekly fall in about 11 months, weighed down by concerns over housing sales, with stocks such as Anant Raj, DLF among others leading the decline. The Nifty Realty index fell 9.2 percent this week, marking its biggest weekly drop in about 11 months. The index slipped up to 3 percent during intra-day trade on Friday and has declined in 12 of the last 13 sessions. It rose marginally by 0.3 percent in only one session during this period, on January 16. In Friday’s session, nine of the 10 constituents of the index were trading in the red, with Sobha Ltd being the lone gainer. Anant Raj shares fell as much as 6 percent, while Lodha Developers, Godrej Properties, DLF and Oberoi Realty declined up to 5 percent. On a weekly basis, Godrej Properties and Lodha Developers dropped 15.3 percent and 13.5 percent, respectively. Brigade Enterprises fell 9.3 percent, Oberoi Realty declined 11.3 percent and Sobha Ltd lost 12.3 percent. ""Rationalisation of home loan interest benefits, continued focus on infrastructure spending, and incentives for affordable and mid-income housing will go a long way in boosting buyer confidence. A stable tax framework and support for sustainable construction will also help developers deliver quality projects while aligning with long-term urban growth goals,"" Umang Jindal, CEO, Homeland Group added. Global brokerage Nuvama said housing sales value declined 6 percent year-on-year in the December quarter, the steepest fall since the upcycle began in 2021. While noting that the Indian real estate sector has seen strong growth since 2021 after years of stagnation, the brokerage maintained a ‘neutral’ stance on housing stocks despite the recent correction. Nuvama said the correction could continue amid concerns over pre-sales growth. It added that housing volumes are likely to remain soft until developers reduce their focus on the luxury segment and shift towards mid-income and premium housing, while also working to improve affordability by keeping prices and ticket sizes in check. The brokerage said companies with a sizeable annuity portfolio are likely to perform better on a relative basis, and named Prestige Estates Projects as its top pick. Deepak Kapoor, Director, Gulshan Group, said ""Housing developments that are quality-led and design-intensive operate on longer gestation cycles with higher capital commitment than mass housing. Granting real estate industry status will improve access to structured financing, enhance investor confidence, and enable the sector’s progression towards global standards and long-term value creation."" Meanwhile, realty major DLF Ltd reported a 16 percent decline in sales bookings to Rs 16,176 crore in the first nine months of the current fiscal due to lower new home supply. The company, however, said it remains confident of meeting its annual pre-sales target. DLF, the country’s largest real estate company by market capitalisation, had recorded sales bookings of Rs 19,187 crore in the year-ago period. According to an investor presentation, the company’s sales bookings fell sharply to Rs 419 crore in the December quarter from a record Rs 12,039 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year. Explaining the sharp decline, DLF said new bookings for its ultra-luxury housing project ‘Dahlias’ were on hold during the December quarter due to a redesign aimed at enhancing customer experience.

Bandhan Bank shares jump 6% as brokerages remain bullish despite 52% fall in Q3 net profit; here's why,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/bandhan-bank-shares-jump-6-as-brokerages-remain-bullish-despite-52-fall-in-q3-net-profit-here-s-why-13787862.html,"The shares of Bandhan Bank jumped around 6 percent on January 23 after the lender released its results for the October-December quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026. Brokerages remain bullish on the stock, citing several reasons. Bandhan Bank shares rose to a one-month high of Rs 151.25 apiece in the morning trading hours of Friday. The company had released its Q3 FY26 results in the post-market hours of Thursday. Bandhan Bank Q3 Results: Bandhan Bank reported a net profit of Rs 205.59 crore for the third quarter of FY26, marking a 52 percent year-on-year (YoY) fall from the Rs 426.49 crore net profit reported in the same quarter of the previous financial year. Sequentially however, the lender’s net profit surged around 84 percent QoQ from Rs 111.87 crore reported in the previous quarter (Q2 FY26). Bandhan Bank’s net interest income meanwhile fell around 4.5 percent YoY to Rs 2,688.30 crore during the quarter under review. Asset quality improved, with gross NPA ratio falling to 3.33 percent in Q3 FY26, from 4.68 percent in Q3 FY25 and 5.02 percent in Q2 FY26. Deposits grew 11 percent YoY to Rs 1.57 lakh crore, while gross advances rose 10 percent YoY to Rs 1.45 lakh crore. Net interest margin (NIM) for the quarter stood at 5.9 percent. Motilal Oswal upgrades Bandhan Bank shares: Motilal Oswal upgraded Bandhan Bank shares to ‘Buy’, with a target price of Rs 175 per share. This implies an upside potential of nearly 23 percent from the stock’s previous closing price of Rs 142.46 apiece. The domestic brokerage said that the firm’s Q3 results were more or less in line with estimates. “Bandhan has undergone a long-drawn NPA cycle, which significantly impacted its growth and profitability profile. As a result, the bank delivered a tepid 8% avg. RoE over the past five years,” it said. Motilal expects the bank’s operating performance to recover in the coming quarters, with asset quality regaining normalcy and margins stabilizing. JM Financial upgrades Bandhan Bank shares: JM Financial noted that the company’s net profit missed its estimate despite strong operating performance, primarily due to elevated credit cost which was expected to moderate during the quarter following the NPA sale. However, given the current valuation of 0.7xFY28 P/B, JM Financial feels that the downside potential in the stock looks limited. Hence, the domestic brokerage upgraded the stock to ‘Add’, and increased its target price to Rs 160 apiece. This implies an upside potential of more than 12 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. UBS expects NIM to improve further: UBS said that the company’s Q3 profit missed its estimates due to higher provisions, despite sequential improvement in key metrics. It expects NIM to improve further and slippages to sustain decline. The international brokerage kept a ‘Neutral’ call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 180 per share. This implies an upside potential of more than 26 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. CLSA on Bandhan Bank: CLSA said that Bandhan Bank’s margin largely remained stable, marking a relief after two quarters of sharp decline. AUM growth picked up to 8 percent YoY from 6 percent YoY. The international brokerage kept an ‘Outperform’ rating on the stock, with a target price of Rs 190 per share. This implies an upside potential of more than 33 percent from the previous closing price. Nomura on Bandhan Bank: Nomura kept a ‘Neutral’ call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 160 per share. It noted that Bandhan Bank’s asset quality recovery lagged peers in Q3FY26 However, it noted that the stock trades at inexpensive valuation of 0.8x FY27 BVPS.

Accumulate Cyient DLM; target of Rs 421: Deven Choksey,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/accumulate-cyient-dlm-target-of-rs-421-deven-choksey-13787831.html,"Deven Choksey report on Cyient DLM Cyient DLM’s Q3 FY26 revenue came in at INR 3,033 mn, declining 31.7% YoY and 2.3% QoQ which is below our estimates by -9.0%. This performance largely reflects the completion of a large, cyclical defense order in FY25, though the Aerospace, Industrial, and Med-Tech segments showed healthy YoY growth. While revenue was soft due to temporary shipment ""push outs"" related to year-end holidays and US tariff uncertainty, management reported a record order backlog of INR 23.5 billion and a strong YTD bookto-bill ratio of 1.56x, indicating robust demand and visibility for a stronger Q4 and FY27. EBITDA stood at INR 275 mn, down 2.3% YoY and 11.9% QoQ, and missed our estimate of INR 350 mn. EBITDA margin came in at 9.1% (down 98 bps QoQ, up 273 bps YoY) but was 144 bps below our estimate of 10.5%, indicating weaker operating leverage and higher cost absorption pressures during the quarter. Reported PAT came in at INR 112 mn, up 2.2% YoY but down 65.1% QoQ, and missed our estimate. The sharp QoQ decline was primarily due to a steep fall in other income (INR 43 mn vs INR 227 mn in Q2), which had benefited from one-offs. PAT margin stood at 3.7% (down 665 bps QoQ, up 123 bps YoY). Outlook We have roll forwarded our valuation basis to Dec’27 estimates and value Cyient DLM at 26.0x Dec’27 EPS, implying a target price of INR 421. We reiterate our “ACCUMULATE” rating on the stock.

Despite furloughs the BFSI performance was healthy (+3.7% QoQ). The performance beyond BFSI was weak due to seasonality in TMT, while Logistics has reached steady state and was muted QoQ. Ex-logistics & Transportation, the company has reported ~16% YoY growth over 9MFY26. The company’s recalibrated approach to introduce platforms + service delivery, while infusing human-agent model, drives incremental engagement to strategic transformation deals. The large transformation deals have increased to 14 in 9MFY26 (vs 11 deals in 9MFY25). The new deal TCV at USD428m (up 22% YoY) translates to USD 1.7bn 9MFY26 deal TCV (+95% YoY). On margins, the company has maintained a narrow band despite the drop in Q3 effort utilization. Developing platforms and IPs would be a continued effort and hence keep margins within a guided band (14.75%-15.75%).

"Gold, silver ETFs rise up to 30% from Thursday's lows as record precious metal rally extends: Should you buy here?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/gold-silver-etfs-rise-30-from-thursday-s-lows-as-record-precious-metal-rally-extends-should-investors-buy-here-13787569.html,"Gold and silver exchange traded funds (ETFs) rebounded sharply on January 23, recovering strong losses which were recorded earlier yesterday. Experts have commented on whether the rally in the precious metals will continue, and what lies ahead. Notably, today’s sharp recovery in ETFs come as precious metals soared to fresh all-time highs. The ETFs however are still away from their 52-week highs, which they had hit a day before yesterday before taking a breather from the rally. Tata Silver ETF, which had crashed up to 24 percent yesterday, hitting a low of Rs 25.56 apiece. The ETF rebounded sharply today, rising more than 17 percent to hit the day’s high at Rs 33 apiece. This marks a 29 percent jump from the low hit by the ETF earlier yesterday. Groww Gold ETF is currently the top gainer among all the gold ETFs. The ETFs jumped 7 percent to trade at Rs 155.97 apiece today. The sharp surge in gold and silver ETFs is a clear reflection of how aggressively investors are repositioning toward safe-haven assets amid heightened global uncertainty, said Justin Khoo, Senior Market Analyst - APAC, VT Market. Should you buy ETFs now? Speaking about yesterday's crash, Prasenjit Paul, Equity Research Analyst at Paul Asset & Fund Manager at 129 Wealth Fund said that what unsettles investors on days like yesterday is not the fall in gold or silver, but the illusion of stability that ETFs create. “Precious metals are volatile assets, ETFs make them feel tradable like stocks, encouraging investors to react to daily price moves. The real risk is owning them without clarity on allocation or purpose or without a proper entry-exit plan,” he explained. Precious metals experienced sharp volatility in late December 2025 and early January 2026. Despite price swings, the fundamentals of precious metals are compelling, driven by near-record industrial demand from solar panels, electric vehicles and AI infrastructure, said Tanvi Kanchan, Associate Director at Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers. “Given the current geopolitical landscape—from ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine to U.S.-China tensions and uncertainty around trade policies under the new Trump administration—precious metals maintain their relevance as portfolio hedges. However, after such explosive gains in 2025, timing a single-entry point is treacherous,” the analyst said. According to Kanchan, investors should consider spreading purchases over the coming weeks or months, instead of deploying capital all at once. For conservative investors, allocating 5-10% of portfolios to precious metals ETFs through systematic purchases reduces timing risk while maintaining exposure to an asset class that benefits from geopolitical instability and monetary policy uncertainty, she said. While the momentum remains intact, such elevated levels also increase the risk of short-term volatility and profit-taking, cautioned Khoo. The analyst added that ETF demand still suggests investor conviction in precious metals as a strategic hedge remains robust. Gold or silver? Motilal Oswal believes the gold looks more favourable now, after silver's massive rally. ""Silver has delivered sharp outperformance in a short span, and with the gold–silver ratio now near lower levels, the near-term risk-reward is turning more favourable for gold. While we remain positive on both metals and silver continues to have long-term upside backed by industrial demand and tight physical market conditions, the recent rally has also increased near-term volatility,"" said Navneet Damani, Head of Research Commodities and Manav Modi, Commodities Analyst, Motilal Oswal Financial Services. The analyst said that in this phase, a higher allocation to gold can help manage fluctuations while staying invested in precious metals. Follow all LIVE updates from the stock markets here."
"Gold, silver ETFs rebound up to 17% a day after crash as precious metals hit new highs: What lies ahead?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/gold-silver-etfs-rebound-up-to-10-a-day-after-crash-as-precious-metals-hit-new-highs-what-lies-ahead-13787468.html,"Gold and silver exchange traded funds (ETFs) rebounded sharply on January 23, rising as much as 17 percent as the precious metals regained ground after some correction. This comes a day after the ETFs crashed significantly following a record rally, as tariff concerns eased. While the ETFs are still away from their recent highs, the precious metals surged to fresh lifetime highs. Precious metals hit fresh all-time highs: Gold futures with February expiry on MCX hit fresh all time high of Rs 1,59,226 per 10 grams. The contracts with April and June expiries also hit lifetime highs at Rs 1,68,000 per 10 grams and Rs 1,73,676 per 10 grams, respectively. Silver futures with March expiry jumped to a fresh all time high of Rs 3,39,927 per kilogram. The contracts with May and July expiries were also at all-time high levels. This comes after the contracts fell around 4 percent yesterday. COMEX silver contract neared $100 per ounce and the gold contract neared $5,000 per ounce, as geopolitical tensions lingered even as US President Donald Trump walked back on his threats of imposing tariffs on European Union nations in his push to acquire Greenland. The commodity prices also rose as the US dollar remained weak. The dollar remained down on Friday, to record its worst week so far in a year, after falling the most in a month in the US trading session. A weaker dollar makes dollar-denominated commodities such as gold cheaper for those holding other currencies, aiding demand. The safe-haven demand for both precious metals continued to rise amid uncertainty around the Greenland issue despite Trump's statements about working towards a future deal. Details of the ""framework"" of the deal have been hazy, and European officials on Thursday appeared to be willing to talk about it only in vague terms, Dow Jones reported. European Union leaders met for a summit late on Thursday after Trump stepped back from his threat to impose new tariffs over Greenland, Blomberg reported. While Trump's step back has removed the immediate threat to European economic and geopolitical sovereignty, leaders are beginning to sift through the longer-term implications, the report said. During the summit, European leaders said they wanted an EU-US trade deal to be back on track after the European Parliament suspended its ratification in protest over Trump's threats. However, Trump's threats shook Europe's confidence in its partner, Reuters reported, quoting EU officials and leaders as saying. ""Transatlantic relations have definitely taken a big blow over the last ‌week,"" the report quoted the bloc's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas as saying. While saying ‌they want to work on strengthening transatlantic cooperation, the EU leaders warned that they were ready to act if Trump was to threaten them again, the report said. Gold ETFs: Groww Gold ETF, Invesco India Gold ETF, Motilal Oswal Gold ETF and Axis Gold ETF climbed around 4 percent each, while 360 ONE Gold ETF, Bandhan Gold ETF, Tata Gold ETF, Angel One Gold ETF, Zerodha Gold ETF, Quantum Gold ETF, ICICI Prudential Gold ETF, Edelweiss Gold ETF and Union Gold ETF meanwhile gained more than 3 percent each. LIC Mutual Fund Gold ETF, Nippon Gold ETF, Nippon India ETF Gold Bees, HDFC Gold ETF and others meanwhile gained around 3 percent each. Silver ETFs: 360 ONE Silver ETF was the top gainer, jumping more than 10 percent, while Tata Silver ETF, which had crashed up to 24 percent yesterday, jumped 9 percent today. Mirae Asset Silver ETF, Axis Silver ETF, Edelweiss Silver ETF, Aditya Birla Sun Life Silver ETF, DSP Silver ETF, ICICI Prudential Silver ETF and others gained around 9 percent each. Nippon India Silver ETF, HDFC Silver ETF, Zerodha Silver ETF and others gained more than 8 percent each. What lies ahead? Despite price swings, the fundamentals of the precious metals are compelling, driven by near-record industrial demand from solar panels, electric vehicles and AI infrastructure, said Tanvi Kanchan, Associate Director, Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers. ""Rather than deploying capital all at once, investors should consider spreading purchases over the coming weeks or months. This approach captures the dip while protecting against further corrections that could see silver test,"" the analyst said. ""For conservative investors, allocating 5-10% of portfolios to precious metals ETFs through systematic purchases reduces timing risk while maintaining exposure to an asset class that benefits from geopolitical instability and monetary policy uncertainty. The structural deficits and industrial demand provide a floor, but expect continued volatility as the market digests 2025's historic run,"" she added. The sharp surge in gold and silver ETFs is a clear reflection of how aggressively investors are repositioning toward safe-haven assets amid heightened global uncertainty, said Justin Khoo, Senior Market Analyst - APAC, VT Market. ""Gold prices trading near $4,950–$4,970 per ounce on COMEX, while silver rallies close to $99 per ounce, have pushed both metals firmly into record territory. This strength is being reinforced by a softer US dollar, persistent geopolitical tensions, and growing concerns around currency stability, all of which are driving strong ETF inflows as investors prefer liquid, regulated exposure. The move is equally striking, with gold prices approaching ₹1.6 lakh per 10 grams and silver nearing ₹3.5 lakh per kg, underscoring the global nature of the rally,"" the analyst said. While the momentum remains intact, such elevated levels also increase the risk of short-term volatility and profit-taking, Khoo said, adding that ETF demand still suggests investor conviction in precious metals as a strategic hedge remains robust.

"IndiGo share price falls nearly 2% in early trade after Q3 results, even as analysts bullish on stock",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/interglobe-aviation-shares-fall-nearly-2-in-early-trade-after-q3-results-even-as-analysts-bullish-on-stock-13787083.html,"Shares of IndiGo operator InterGlobe Aviation Ltd slipped in early trade on Friday with the stock down 1.96 percent at Rs 4,813, a day after the company reported its Q3 FY26 financial results. The airline’s market capitalisation stood at about Rs 1.86 lakh crore. The decline comes after InterGlobe Aviation disclosed a sharp year-on-year fall in reported net profit for the December quarter, weighed down by sizeable one-time exceptional items linked to the implementation of new labour codes and operational disruption during early December. The company had said these exceptional charges materially impacted headline profitability, even as revenue growth and operational metrics remained steady. However, brokerages largely looked past the headline profit decline, maintaining Buy ratings on the stock and reiterating confidence in IndiGo’s underlying business. UBS said the quarter was a “decent show despite disruptions”, noting that management expects capacity growth of around 10 percent year-on-year in Q4 FY26, led largely by international expansion. UBS also flagged guidance for higher costs in the March quarter but said yields are expected to moderate only gradually from a strong base. Citi said the Q3 financial impact of the FDTL-related disruption was lower than its estimates, with yields coming in better than expected and operational parameters broadly in line. Goldman Sachs said reported profit before tax was above estimates, adding that costs excluding forex, particularly aircraft rentals, were lower than anticipated, while management reiterated guidance of around 10 percent ASK growth in Q4, driven mainly by international operations. InterGlobe Aviation stock had closed at Rs 4,929 on Thursday ahead of the results, having gained over 19 percent in the past one year, outperforming the benchmark Nifty 50.

Should you buy or sell IndiGo shares after Q3 profit hit by one-offs? Brokerages bullish; check target prices,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/should-you-buy-or-sell-indigo-shares-after-q3-profit-hit-by-one-offs-brokerages-bullish-check-target-prices-13787022.html,"Brokerages have largely maintained a bullish stance on IndiGo parent InterGlobe Aviation despite a sharp headline drop in Q3 FY26 net profit, arguing that the earnings impact was driven by one-time disruptions and regulatory changes rather than any deterioration in the airline’s underlying business. InterGlobe Aviation reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 549.8 crore for the fiscal third quarter, down 77.5 percent year-on-year, weighed down by exceptional charges linked to the implementation of new labour codes and operational disruption during early December. Excluding exceptional items and forex impact, underlying profitability remained healthy, brokerages said in their post-results assessments. Ahead of the quarterly results, InterGlobe Aviation shares rose 1.47 percent to end at Rs 4,929 on NSE on Thursday. The stock is up about 19 percent over the past year, outperforming the benchmark Nifty 50. InterGlobe Aviation stock call: Brokerages positive on growth narrative UBS reiterated its ‘Buy’ rating on IndiGo stock with a target price of Rs 6,170 per share, implying an upside of over 25 percent. UBS said that while the near-term outlook remains soft, medium- to long-term fundamentals are intact. The brokerage said the October-December quarter performance was “decent despite disruptions”, adding that management’s guidance of around 10 percent capacity growth in Q4 FY26 -- largely led by international expansion -- supports the growth narrative. It flagged higher cost guidance for the January-March quarter, but said yields are expected to moderate only gradually from a strong base. Citi also retained a ‘Buy’ call with a target of Rs 5,700, stating that the financial impact of the FDTL-related disruption was lower than its estimates and that operational metrics were broadly in line. Citi highlighted better-than-expected yields and said IndiGo’s operations are normalising, with market share remaining strong and international route expansion continuing. Goldman Sachs maintained its ‘Buy’ rating with a target price of Rs 6,000, noting that reported profit before tax came in above expectations despite exceptional costs. Goldman said costs excluding forex, particularly aircraft rentals, were lower than anticipated, while yields and ticketing RASK were largely in line with estimates. It also pointed to management’s guidance of around 10 percent year-on-year ASK growth in Q4, driven mainly by international operations. Operationally, while brokerages acknowledged the impact of December’s disruptions and the regulatory reset, they underlined IndiGo’s strong balance sheet, scale advantage and execution track record. With cash balances remaining robust and capacity growth set to resume in the fiscal fourth quarter, analysts broadly see the Q3 setback as transitory rather than structural.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Ipca Laboratories, SAIL, Gland Pharma, Indian Bank, Bharat Electronics, and others on January 23?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-ipca-laboratories-sail-gland-pharma-indian-bank-bharat-electronics-and-others-on-january-23-13786869.html,"The benchmark indices rebounded with a half-percent rally on January 22, with market breadth turning positive. About 2,176 shares advanced against 740 declining shares on the NSE. The market is expected to consolidate with range-bound trading as long as it trades below the current week’s high. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Jay Mehta, Technical Research at JM Financial Services Ipca Laboratories | CMP: Rs 1,485.6  Ipca Laboratories broke out from a prolonged triangular consolidation between January 2 and 9 with a 13.6 percent rally, while broader indices corrected around 2.5 percent, highlighting superior relative strength. The breakout was supported by robust volume participation. Currently retesting the breakout zone, the stock formed a strong dragonfly doji, signalling that the throwback is likely complete and upside resumption is imminent. Momentum studies favour a bullish bias. However, the price remains below short-, medium-, and long-term moving averages. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,680, Rs 1,733 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,380 One 97 Communications Paytm | CMP: Rs 1,260.5  Paytm was confined to a long-term bearish wedge consolidation. It broke down from the pattern a few days ago, but follow-through selling was absent, leading to sideways action with lower highs and lower lows. Wednesday delivered a decisive breakdown below the consolidation range on a strong bearish candle backed by heavy volume. Momentum studies show multiple bearish divergences, with indicators failing to make new highs. The price trades below short- and medium-term moving averages, and trend indicators point to a continued negative bias. Initiate shorts at current levels and add shorts on rises up to Rs 1,295. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 1,145, Rs 1,118 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,368 Amber Enterprises India | CMP: Rs 5,732  Amber Enterprises broke down from a rising trendline active since May 2023 on a strong bearish gap-down with heavy volume, indicating a significant supply shift. Since then, it has maintained a downtrend with lower highs and lower lows inside a sloping channel. Wednesday confirmed a breakdown below the channel. The price trades well below medium- and long-term moving averages. On shorter timeframes, it broke down from a bearish flag-and-pole pattern, suggesting potential for accelerated downside momentum. Sell at CMP and add shorts on rises up to Rs 5,950. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 5,250, Rs 5,090 Stop-Loss: Rs 6,326 Om Mehra, Technical Research Analyst at Samco Securities Steel Authority of India | CMP: Rs 151.65  SAIL has resumed its upward trajectory after a brief consolidation and is now holding above the Rs 150 level, which had earlier acted as a minor hurdle. The stock is trading comfortably above its short-term moving averages and is respecting the rising VWAP (volume-weighted average price), which has acted as a reliable support during recent pullbacks. The stock is stabilising above the mid-Bollinger band and is attempting to move back toward the upper range. The daily RSI is placed near 61, indicating sustained strength. The MACD continues to remain in positive territory, although momentum has moderated slightly. Volumes have improved during the recent up move, reflecting renewed participation after the pullback. The near-term outlook remains favourable as long as the stock holds above the Rs 146 support area. A sustained move above the Rs 154 level could open the path for further upside. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 165 Stop-Loss: Rs 144 Jammu and Kashmir Bank | CMP: Rs 107.09  J&K Bank has witnessed a sharp revival after a brief corrective phase and is now trading firmly above the Rs 105–106 zone, which had earlier acted as immediate resistance. The stock has maintained its position above all key moving averages, reflecting a strong rebound. The latest session marked a decisive move higher with an open-low formation, highlighting sustained strength. The daily RSI is placed near 62 and has moved back into the higher zone, indicating improving momentum. The MACD has turned positive, with the histogram expanding on the upside. Volumes have expanded meaningfully during the breakout. The near-term outlook remains positive as long as the stock holds above the Rs 102–103 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 118 Stop-Loss: Rs 101 Gland Pharma | CMP: Rs 1,723.3  Gland Pharma is showing early signs of stabilisation after a prolonged decline and is now forming a base in the Rs 1,650–1,670 zone. The daily chart indicates a double-bottom formation, with the stock gradually moving higher from recent lows. The stock is trading above the 20-day and 50-day SMAs. A positive divergence is visible in the daily RSI, which is placed near the 53 level. The MACD remains below the zero line but is trending upward, indicating that the recovery is still in its early phase. Volumes remain on the lower side but have shown slight improvement over the last few sessions, which is typically seen when a stock begins to build a base. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,850 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,655 Aakash Shah, Research Analyst at Choice Broking Indian Bank | CMP: Rs 896.75  Indian Bank is trading at all-time high levels, highlighting strong bullish dominance and sustained institutional participation. The stock remains in a well-defined uptrend, with price action consistently forming higher highs and higher lows, indicating strength rather than exhaustion. On the daily chart, the all-time-high breakout indicates strong demand, as there is no overhead supply pressure. The breakout is supported by a strong bullish candle, reflecting confident buying interest. From a moving-average perspective, the stock is trading well above the key EMAs, all of which are positively aligned and sloping upward. The 20 EMA continues to act as a reliable dynamic support, with every minor pullback being absorbed quickly, reinforcing the strength of the trend. Structurally, the Rs 855 zone now acts as a strong demand and support area. As long as the price sustains above this region, the bullish structure remains intact. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 950 Stop-Loss: Rs 855 Bharat Electronics | CMP: Rs 417.3  Bharat Electronics is showing signs of a bullish consolidation breakout setup within a broader uptrend. After an extended rally, the stock entered a brief consolidation phase and is now attempting to resume its upward move. On the daily chart, price action reflects a higher-low structure, with the stock holding above its key moving averages. BEL is trading above the key EMAs, while the 200 EMA continues to trend higher, confirming long-term trend strength. The recent breakout from a short-term falling channel suggests a pause in momentum rather than a trend reversal. The 20 and 50 EMAs are acting as immediate support, indicating that dips are being bought into. Volume has picked up modestly on the breakout attempt, while selling pressure during consolidation remained muted—a positive sign of accumulation. Structurally, the Rs 405 zone now acts as a strong support base. Sustained trade above this zone keeps the bullish structure intact and opens the path toward the Rs 440 level in the coming sessions. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 440 Stop-Loss: Rs 405 Godrej Consumer Products | CMP: Rs 1,246  Godrej Consumer Products is displaying a clear trend reversal and breakout structure after a prolonged consolidation and base formation. The stock has transitioned from a sideways-to-bearish phase into a fresh bullish leg. Price action on the daily chart shows a strong breakout from a multi-week base near the Rs 1,100–1,120 zone, followed by a series of higher highs and higher lows. The stock has decisively reclaimed the 20, 50, and 100 EMAs, with short-term averages turning upward, signalling renewed bullish momentum. Acceptance above the 100 EMA further strengthens the reversal thesis. Volume expansion during the breakout move, combined with relatively lighter volume during the prior consolidation, highlights accumulation behaviour rather than distribution. The sharp bullish impulse leg suggests strong institutional participation. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,320 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,200"

Click to View More Outlook for January 23 Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities After showing a high volatility at the lows of around 25000 recently, Nifty bounced back decently on Thursday amidst volatility and closed the day higher by 132 points. After opening with an upside gap of 187 points, the market moved up further in the early part of the session. Profit booking has occurred from near the highs of 25400 in the mid part, but the market recovered towards the end. A small red candle was formed on the daily chart with upper and lower shadow. Technically, this market action indicates a formation of high wave type candle pattern. The formation of high wave type candles in the last two sessions signals heightened volatility in the market. The crucial 200day EMA support has been regained on Thursday and Nifty closed above it. The overall near-term trend of the market remains weak, but the short-term bounce is unfolding. A sustainable up move above 25500 could confirm near term bottom reversal pattern for the Nifty. On the other side, any weakness from here could drag Nifty down to the recent swing lows of around 24900-25000 levels in the near term. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The index consolidated after a positive start, supported by strong global cues. However, it faced resistance near the 38.20% Fibonacci retracement level, resulting in a decline from the day’s high of 25,435 to 25,168 before closing near the midpoint of the session’s range. Although the index managed to close above the 200DMA for the second consecutive day, the overall sentiment remains weak, as reflected by the elevated India VIX, which stood at 13.35. In the short term, the index is likely to remain volatile on Friday. Resistance is placed in the 25,480–25,500 zone, while support is seen around 25,125.
