Hold National Aluminium Co; target of Rs 356: Prabhudas Lilladher,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/hold-national-aluminium-co-target-of-rs-356-prabhudas-lilladher-13805031.html,"Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on National Aluminium Co National Aluminium (NACL) delivered strong operating performance in Q3FY26, on strong aluminum volume growth/ pricing, which negated weak alumina pricing. Alumina volumes grew 8% YoY to 403kt, while metal volumes grew robust 19% YoY to 126kt aided by exports, strong domestic sales and weak base. Alumina NSR declined 13% QoQ to USD352/t, in line with the fall in alumina prices of 10.5% QoQ, while average NSR for the metal increased 5% QoQ to USD3,072/t. NACL has been focusing on cost reduction, which is evident in the significant decline in P&F and employee costs, driven by higher usage of captive coal, and superannuation-led savings of ~Rs1.18bn in 9MFY26. The management reiterated that the commissioning of the 1mtpa alumina refinery (0.3mt volume in FY27) and the Pottangi bauxite mine remains on track for commissioning in Jun’26. Outlook We raise FY27/28E EBITDA by 6%/4%, assuming higher LME prices of USD3,001/2,932 (earlier USD2,918/2,851). Every USD100 increase in ally prices would lead to ~6% upgrade in our NACL EBITDA. Maintain ‘HOLD’ with revised TP of Rs356 (from Rs337, assigning same 5x EV/EBITDA multiple). At CMP, the stock is trading at 6x/5.3x EV of FY27/28E EBITDA.

The low-teen growth in power volumes came despite muted national power demand (-1% YoY), supported by softer shortterm power prices. IEX continues to benefit from a cash-rich balance sheet (cash of ~Rs15bn in Q3FY26, ~13% of market capitalization), negligible capex requirements and high RoE (~40%); however, the proposed market coupling mechanism poses a key overhang on its near-monopoly position in the DAM segment (~40% of its volume) of exchange. We model power volume growth (ex-REC) of 15%/9%/11% in FY26E/FY27E/FY28E, assuming a gradual decline in DAM market share to 85% in FY27E and 70% in FY28E, while maintaining power segment margins at ~Rs0.04/kWh. Following the CERC’s Jul’25 order mandating centralized price discovery for DAM, IEX has appealed to APTEL, with the hearing concluded and an order expected by Q4FY26. Outlook Given the expected moderation in volume growth to ~10% CAGR over FY26–28E from ~20% CAGR over FY20–25, we believe IEX is likely to trade at a lower valuation multiple versus historical levels.

The organic performance translates to revenue decline of ~1.0% QoQ, which is a third consecutive quarter of organic revenue decline. The organic revenue decline attributed to spending that the clients have deprioritized on vehicle architecture and development, especially on the US and Japan PV. Even the deal signing for Q3 remains weak at USD 202m, that translates to 9MFY26 growth of +4.7% YoY. The company has evaluated ways to overhaul its currently “service-led” offerings to off-the-shelf “solution-led” offerings with limited customization on top. Additionally, the revenue cannibalization from service to solution is a gradual move and would require 12-18 months before it completely pivots to new offering mix. We believe the transition would require additional efforts and leadership bandwidth to repurpose its offerings and stay relevant to its strategic accounts. Already a slowdown in Automotive and a transition of offering mix on top would continue to weigh on revenue growth for FY27. Additionally, the company has borrowed ~USD50m to fund the acquisitions that will create additional pressure on the bottom line. We are adjusting FY27E/FY28E revenue growth and margin on account of transition and signing weak deal TCV for 9MFY26.

Premium segments, however, continue to do well with doubledigit growth. Demand momentum improved across both urban and rural channels as disruption from GST rationalization stabilized. Given that Dabur has grown by 10% in oral care, we don’t rule out some market share loss for CLGT in toothpaste segment. We expect gradual volume to set in given benefits of GST cuts, however such impact in oral care has been seen to be muted even in 2017-18. CLGT’s longterm drivers remain intact, led by (1) strengthening core toothpaste franchises and (2) premiumization through science-backed innovations within oral care.

Nestlé delivered a strong quarter, reporting 18.6% YoY revenue growth and 9.0% YoY EBITDA growth, with margins contracting 183 bps due to elevated input costs (coffee, cocoa, milk and palm oil).

The Nifty Defence index was down 1.76 percent after having fallen around 5.6 percent on February 1, reflecting investor disappointment over the lack of what analysts described as “big bang” measures. Hindustan Aeronautics slipped about 3 percent, Bharat Dynamics fell nearly 6 percent, while Bharat Electronics was trading marginally lower by 0.33 percent. As many as 16 of the 18 constituents of the Nifty Defence index were trading in the red. Brokerages, however, maintained that higher defence capital expenditure should support order inflows over the medium term. The Union Budget raised core defence capital expenditure by 18 percent year-on-year for FY27. The total defence budget now stands at Rs 7.6 lakh crore, up 7 percent from the revised estimate. Citi said continued prioritisation of defence and localisation remains supportive for order inflows, but added that near-term upside could be limited following the sharp rally in defence stocks. Lack of Big Bang Annoucements Nomura said the budget lacked “big bang” measures, even as it viewed the increase in defence capital expenditure as a positive. CLSA said defence spending growth is likely to moderate on a high base after strong increases in FY26. It noted that execution of large orders and exports continue to remain supportive for the sector. The brokerage said adjusted capital expenditure growth is pegged at 10.7 percent in FY27 compared with 6.2 percent in FY26, largely in line with market consensus. It added that defence growth could slow on a high base, while railways and roads may see a pickup on a low base. CLSA also pointed out that the revised defence capital expenditure for FY26 was Rs 2.2 trillion, compared with the budget estimate of Rs 1.8 trillion, and that defence capex in FY27 is expected to grow by a muted 5.2 per cent on this revised base. Defence stocks saw a sharp sell-off in the session following the Budget on February 1, with several frontline and mid-cap names correcting 5–10 percent in a single day.

Sensex dropped more than 400 points from its day's high, while Nifty fell below 24,850. Sensex was however up more than 62 points (around 0.1 percent) at 80,785.44, while Nifty 50 was down 19 points (around 0.1 percent) to 24,806.2, as seen at around 11.30 am. Nifty Bank index plunged 0.66 Most of the sectoral indices remained in the red, with Nifty PSU Bank index dropping more than 1.5 percent. Markets are currently extending losses after crashing sharply yesterday after Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented Union Budget 2026. Here are some of the key factors behind market fall: Weak global cues: The fall in Indian stock markets comes amid weak global cues. Asian markets remained weak, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 falling 0.98 percent to 52,809. South Korea’s KOSPI fell as much as 5 percent, while China’s Hang Seng dropped nearly 3 percent. Wall Street futures remained weak as well, with Dow Jones futures being down 0.75 percent. STT hike: While presenting Budget 2026, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman raised STT on futures to 0.05 percent from 0.02 percent. This was seen as a significant reason for the market crash yesterday as well, as investors on the contrary had expected significant relief on this front. Benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty fell 2% on Sunday. Goldman Sachs sees near-term valuation risk to Indian equities as unexpected hike in derivatives trading tax adds to already weak foreign sentiment. It added that Sunday's sharp drop reflects a combination of concerns around STT hike on F&O, global sell-off in metals, and domestic selling on low volumes in anticipation of foreign outflows on Monday. The global investment bank said the softer fiscal drag in the budget, along with steady capex spending was largely in-line with its expectations. It however retained its constructive view on Indian equities and expects high-teen full-year returns, driven by underlying earnings recovery. ""This was not a revenue raising measure, but a decision to discourage retail traders from complex F&O trading, in which 92% of them were losing money. This decision is in the interest of retail investors. But this decision impacted the market sentiments, which were already impacted by the decision to make no changes in the LTCGs tax, which a section of the market was expecting rather unrealistically,"" said VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments. FII selling: On February 1, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) sold equities worth ₹588 crore, while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) also remained net sellers, offloading shares worth Rs 682 crore, adding to the pressure on the market. ""The 10% nominal GDP growth projected in the Budget is achievable and has the potential to deliver around 15% earnings growth in FY27. The market will soon start discounting this positive. But it is possible that FIIs may continue to sell impacting the market. Retail investors should keep their cool and remain invested and continue to invest systematically. A significant upturn in the market may take time; perhaps a retreat from AI trade globally. We don’t know when this will happen. But we know that an earnings rebound is imminent in response to this growth oriented Budget. That is a clear positive,"" said Vijayakumar. What should investors do? Given persistent global uncertainties and rising volatility, traders are advised to remain selective and disciplined, focusing on fundamentally strong stocks on declines, said Aakash Shah, Technical Research Analyst at Choice Equity Broking Private Limited. ""Fresh long positions should be considered only after a confirmed and sustained breakout above the 25,000 level on the Nifty, which would signal a meaningful improvement in market sentiment,"" he added. Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research at Kotak Securities, said that the short-term market texture is volatile, and volatility is likely to continue in the near future. ""Hence, level-based trading would be the ideal strategy for day traders. On the higher side, 25,000/81300 would act as a crucial resistance zone. As long as the market is trading below this level, weak sentiment is likely to prevail,"" he said. ""On the downside, the correction wave is likely to continue till 24650-24600/80100-79900.

"Gold, silver ETFs recover up to 10% after crash: Analysts say long-term outlook remains bullish",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/gold-silver-etfs-recover-up-to-10-after-crash-analysts-say-long-term-outlook-remains-bullish-13804872.html,"Gold and silver exchange traded funds (ETFs) made a partial recovery on February 2, after crashing sharply earlier during the day. Analysts have expressed belief in the long-term bullish outlook for the precious metals, despite current volatility. Edelweiss Silver ETF, which had hit the 20 percent lower circuit earlier during the day, recovered nearly 10 percent to trade at Rs 232.17 apiece, as seen at 10.30 am. Axis Silver ETF, which also crashed 20 percent earlier during the day, also recovered around 10 percent to trade at Rs 231.85 apiece. Gold ETFs, which were down up to 9 percent in the early trading hours, were down up to 5 percent, as seen at 10.40 am. It is important to note that despite the partial recovery, most of the ETFs are still in the deep red. Gold, silver prices recover: Gold futures with March expiry on MCX, which fell to Rs 1,40,001 per 10 grams earlier during the day, recovered nearly 3 percent to trade at Rs 1,43,800 per 10 grams. Silver futures however are yet to show notable rebound from day’s lows. Why are gold, silver prices falling today? Gold and silver ETFs, which earlier saw a significant surge along with the precious metals, have seen a significant decline recently, with the trend continuing today as well. The sharp fall in gold and silver prices came amid rampant profit-booking, along with stronger dollar. US President Donald Trump said he had chosen former ⁠Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh, who is known to be hawkish and rigid about rate cuts, to ⁠head ⁠the American central bank. Additionally, CME Group announced hikes in margins on its metal futures on Saturday and the changes are set to take effect after market close on Monday. This will also likely weigh on precious metals. COMEX gold futures ⁠margins have been raised from 6 percent to 8 percent, while COMEX 5000 silver futures are set to increase to 15 percent ‍from 11 percent. Here's what analysts say: The recent ""flash crash"" in gold and silver, triggered by a hawkish US Fed nominee and increased margin requirements, is viewed by many as a necessary cooling of ""overbought"" markets rather than a trend reversal, said Abhinav Tiwari, Research Analyst at Bonanza. He however noted that the long-term outlook remains structurally bullish, despite the volatility. “Record central bank buying, silver’s persistent supply deficit, and geopolitical tensions provide a solid floor,” he said. “We have maintained a cautious stance on silver following its parabolic move and have suggested trimming overallocation to precious metals to realign portfolios with long-term strategic allocation levels.

The sharp rise in the share prices pushed the Nifty Capital Markets index up more than 1 percent to 4,438.95 in the morning trading hours of Monday. STT on F&O increased: While presenting Budget 2026, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman raised STT on futures to 0.05 percent from 0.02 percent. This was seen as a significant reason for the market crash yesterday, as investors on the contrary had expected significant relief on this front. For every Rs 1 lakh worth of futures sold, traders will now pay Rs 20 in STT instead of the previous Rs 12.50, explained Ashish Singhal, Co-founder of Lemonn. For a Rs 10,000 option contract sale, STT increased to Rs 10 from Rs 6.25, he added. As a result, BSE shares tumbled more than 15 percent to Rs 2,377.40 on Sunday, before recovering some losses. The Nifty Capital Markets index plunged 6 percent to close at 4,381 yesterday. Jefferies on STT hike: Jefferies however remained broadly optimistic, suggesting that the STT hike is largely manageable. It added that the change should be viewed as a “sentiment negative”, and not a structural change. Industry checks done by the international brokerage suggested around 5 percent volume impact. It added that there may be 5 percent drop in average daily turnover/orders, and this could mean around 4 percent earnings impact for companies like BSE and Groww. Citi on capital markets: Citi said that the STT hike will act as a near-term sentiment overhang, and likely result in a marginal decline in F&O volumes. However, the long-term behavioural change may be limited, it added. The international brokerage said that past STT hikes had muted impact on options turnover. It sees Angel One and Groww facing mild topline pressure due to high F&O mix, with minimal impact for others like Nuvama. Capital markets stocks: BSE shares gained nearly 4 percent to trade at Rs 2,694.50 apiece. Nuvama, Angel One and Motilal Oswal Financial Services shares gained around 2 percent each, as seen at 10.15 am. HDFC AMC and CAMS shares gained around 1 percent each.

Track the latest updates on GIFT Nifty right here on Moneycontrol. In a volatile Budget-day session on February 1, Indian equity indices ended on a weak note, with the Nifty slipping below 24,600, intraday, after Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in her Union Budget speech, announced a hike in the Securities Transaction Tax (STT) on equity F&O trading. At close, the Sensex was down 1,546.84 points or 1.88 percent at 80,722.94, and the Nifty was down 495.20 points or 1.96 percent at 24,825.45. GIFT Nifty (Up) The GIFT Nifty is trading higher at around 24,879, indicating a positive start for the day. Asian Equities (Mixed) Asian share markets mostly followed Wall Street futures lower on Monday as chaotic trading in silver made for a nervous start to a week that is packed with corporate earnings, central bank meetings, and major economic data. US Equities (Down) Wall Street's main indexes closed lower on Friday as investors viewed President Donald Trump's nomination of former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh as a hawkish choice to succeed Federal Reserve Chair ​Jerome Powell, while also digesting earnings reports and a high inflation reading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 179.09 points, or 0.37%, to 48,892.47, the S&P 500 lost 29.98 points, or 0.43%, to 6,939.03, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 223.30 points, or 0.94%, to 23,461.82.

Dollar Index (Up) The dollar clung to its gains on Monday as investors weighed what a Federal Reserve under Kevin Warsh might look like, with his preference for a smaller balance sheet. Asian Currencies (Down) Asian currencies were trading lower in the early Monday trade, with the South Korean Won leading the losers, followed by the Malaysian Ringgit, Japanese Yen, and Taiwan Dollar. Crude (Slips) Oil prices fell by nearly 3% on Monday as U.S. President Donald Trump said over the weekend Iran was ""seriously talking"" with Washington. Gold (Slips) Gold extended falls on Monday, pressured by a firm dollar, as investors gauged U.S. President Donald Trump's Fed chair pick Kevin Warsh's approach to interest rate cuts, while silver recovered from a more than three-week low hit on Friday.

A total of 1,940 shares declined, against 953 advancing shares on the NSE. The market may consolidate near the previous day’s low after the sharp correction. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Vinay Rajani, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities Infosys | CMP: Rs 1,654.3 The primary trend of Infosys remains bullish, with the stock forming higher tops and higher bottoms. Infosys is trading above all key moving averages, and the IT sector has shown resilience during the recent market fall. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,780 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,600 Max Healthcare Institute | CMP: Rs 976.7 Max Healthcare has formed a double bottom reversal pattern near Rs 940. The stock has closed above its 5-day EMA, while the daily RSI has exited the oversold zone, indicating a potential bullish trend reversal. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,100 Stop-Loss: Rs 940 Aditya Birla Capital | CMP: Rs 329.2 Aditya Birla Capital has breached crucial support levels of its 20- and 50-day EMAs with healthy volume. The stock has also broken down from a consolidation pattern. The weekly RSI has exited the overbought zone, confirming a downward reversal. Sell Aditya Birla Capital February Futures. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 310 Stop-Loss: Rs 342 Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities LTIMindtree | CMP: Rs 6,070.5 LTIMindtree has delivered a consolidation breakout on the daily chart, indicating rising optimism around the counter. The sector looks favourable for the short to medium term, as post-Budget, IT remains the only sector holding on to its gains. Additionally, the stock has closed above the 20-day DMA, confirming a positive bias. Based on the technical setup, the stock could move toward the Rs 6,400–6,600 zone, while on the downside, support is placed at Rs 5,900. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 6,400, Rs 6,600 Stop-Loss: Rs 5,900 Aster DM Healthcare | CMP: Rs 570.40 Aster DM Healthcare appears to be forming a base ahead of a recovery on the daily chart after a sharp correction over the past several weeks. Recently, it found support near the previous congestion zone, strengthening the bullish case. A minor positive divergence is also visible on the daily chart. Overall, the setup points toward a smart recovery in the short term, with potential to move toward Rs 600. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 600 Stop-Loss: Rs 554 Axis Bank | CMP: Rs 1,340.4 Axis Bank has formed a bearish engulfing pattern on the daily chart, indicating waning bullish momentum and the likelihood of additional selling pressure in the short term. Additionally, the RSI has formed a negative divergence near the overbought zone. The trend is expected to remain weak, with potential downside toward Rs 1,270. On the upside, resistance is placed at Rs 1,376. Strategy: Sell Target: Rs 1,270 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,376 Jay Mehta, Technical Research at JM Financial Services NMDC | CMP: Rs 80.38 NMDC broke out above a bullish inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on December 23 from Rs 78.6, rallying to Rs 86.72 before correcting. The pullback found strong support at the 100-day EMA and successfully retested the breakout zone. On January 28, the stock delivered a decisive breakout above a long-term wedge pattern, forming a powerful three white soldiers candle with rising positive volume, confirming accumulation. The price now trades above all key EMAs with upward slopes. Over the past two sessions, it has retested the wedge breakout zone. Momentum remains bullish, and the structure favours buyers as long as the 100-day EMA holds. Given the post-Budget sell-off in indices, add positions in a staggered manner and increase exposure only once the price sustains above the Budget day’s high. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 88, Rs 92 Stop-Loss: Rs 76.3 Power Finance Corporation | CMP: Rs 381.5 PFC has broken out above a long-term bullish wedge and sloping channel, supported by strong volumes, indicating solid participation. The stock trades above all key EMAs except the 200-day EMA. In the latest session, following positive Budget 2026 commentary on PFC/REC restructuring, it attempted to break the 200-day EMA but faced some profit booking. Overall, the bias remains bullish, with higher lows forming and a positive crossover between the 20- and 50-day EMAs. Given the post-Budget sell-off in indices, add positions in a staggered manner and increase exposure only once the price sustains above the Budget day’s high. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 411, Rs 428 Stop-Loss: Rs 356 Jindal Steel | CMP: Rs 1,102 Jindal Steel broke out above its all-time high after consolidating from May 2024 to January 2026, clearing the tough Rs 1,080–1,100 resistance zone (marked multiple times earlier) on strong and rising volumes, indicating genuine participation. The latest session successfully retested the breakout zone without violation. The stock trades well above all key EMAs with upward slopes, confirming a strong structure. Momentum indicators support a continued bullish bias. Given the post-Budget sell-off in indices, add positions in a staggered manner and increase exposure only once the price sustains above the Budget day’s high. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,240, Rs 1,330 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,050 Anand James, Chief Market Strategist at Geojit Investments Arvind | CMP: Rs 330 Arvind is attempting to form a base near Rs 330 after a strong rebound, creating higher lows within a multi-month range of Rs 305–347. A decisive close above Rs 347 would confirm a range breakout and open up targets of Rs 360–375, while failure near this zone would keep the stock rotational. On the downside, Rs 318–312 remains the immediate support area, followed by a stronger base near Rs 305–297. Momentum is improving, with the RSI rising above 50 into the 60s and the MACD turning up with a contracting negative histogram, indicating early momentum repair and a developing base. The technical setup is supported by favourable policy tailwinds from the Union Budget 2026, which announced a five-part, sector-wide push for textiles, covering the National Fibre Scheme, Textile Expansion & Employment Scheme, National Handloom & Handicraft Programme, Text ECON initiative, and SAMARTH 2.0 for skill development. These measures aim to modernise textile clusters, strengthen supply chains, and upgrade workforce capabilities, providing structural medium-term support for integrated textile players like Arvind and reinforcing the stock’s constructive bias on confirmed breakouts. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 360, Rs 375 Stop-Loss: Rs 312 Raymond | CMP: Rs 393.7 Raymond is showing early signs of a short-term turnaround after a sharp corrective phase. On the weekly chart, the stock has formed an inverted hammer, a classic bullish reversal signal when it appears after a decline, indicating rejection of lower levels and emerging buying interest. This pattern suggests that downside momentum may be losing steam, even as the broader trend remains corrective. Momentum indicators support this view. The MACD histogram is showing clear exhaustion, with negative bars contracting, pointing to waning selling pressure and the possibility of a short-term bounce. While the MACD line remains below the signal line, the improving histogram hints at early stabilisation. The RSI remains subdued but is attempting to base, consistent with a relief rally setup rather than a full trend reversal.

Experts identify 9 stocks for investment post Union Budget,https://www.moneycontrol.com/budget/experts-identify-9-stocks-for-investment-post-union-budget-article-13803977.html,"The Union Budget announced on February 1 was largely in line with analysts’ expectations, with Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman maintaining fiscal discipline by lowering the fiscal deficit to 4.3 percent of GDP for FY27 (from 4.4 percent in FY26), based on nominal GDP growth of 10 percent and tax revenue growth of 8 percent. Further, as expected, the government increased capital expenditure by 9 percent to Rs 12.2 lakh crore, providing a boost to infrastructure and defence, while also focusing on employment generation and allocating funds to emerging segments such as data centres, artificial intelligence, tourism, and MSMEs. The market did not anticipate any incremental growth stimulus, as the government had already announced several policy measures in the recent past, including GST rationalisation and relief in personal income tax. Additionally, the RBI had reduced the repo rate by 125 basis points in 2025, along with a 100 basis-point cut in the CRR, which had already supported growth. However, the key disappointment that spooked markets was the increase in Securities Transaction Tax (STT) on futures and options. Experts believe this will not only impact domestic brokerages but also foreign institutional investors (FIIs), who use the F&O segment extensively as a hedging mechanism. Furthermore, the absence of any direct measures to address capital flows or currency stability also weighed on investor sentiment. The benchmark indices corrected 2 percent on Sunday. ""Overall, the budget is a mixed bag for capital markets, with a stable tax regime being maintained, although increases in certain STTs and the borrowing programme may cause some disappointment,"" Ashish Gupta, CIO at Axis Mutual Fund said. In the backdrop of persistent global uncertainty, Harish Krishnan, CIO – Equity at Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC believes the budget reflects realism on policy and fiscal prudence. ""The government remains steadfast on its commitment to consolidation; there is a notable shift from supply-side capex-led stimulus towards supporting domestic consumption. However, elevated borrowing levels may case market discomfort in the near term but expectations in the budget seem to be conservative and leave room for upside,"" he said, adding the outlook for equities over the medium term does not alter too much.

Why IT companies are giving a thumbs-up to the Budget,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/moneycontrol-research/why-it-companies-are-giving-a-thumbs-up-to-the-budget-13803824.html,"The budget has provided clarity on buyback which is especially positive for cash rich IT companies that periodically return cash to shareholders. The Budget proposes that all buybacks will now be taxed as capital gains, replacing the dividend‑like treatment introduced in 2024. To further disincentivise promoters from using buybacks to reduce tax liability, the budget has announced an additional buyback tax on promoters. The change will push the effective tax burden to 22 percent for corporate promoters and 30 percent for non‑corporate promoters. The buyback overhaul builds on the rules notified from October 1, 2024, which had shifted the tax liability from companies to shareholders. Under those rules, the entire buyback amount was treated as dividend income in the hands of shareholders and taxed at slab rates. A key provision that remains is the treatment of share acquisition cost. The cost of shares tendered in a buyback will continue to be treated as a capital loss, either short term or long term, depending on the holding period. Investors can set off these losses against other capital gains or carry them forward for up to eight years, providing some relief in the new system. For small shareholders, the shift to capital gains is expected to give clearer tax outcomes and reduce disputes over classification. For promoters, the additional levy aims to correct what the government views as an uneven tax advantage created by the old rules. The other significant announcement pertains to safe harbour. Safe Harbour rules in India are Income Tax regulations (Section 92CB) that allow taxpayers to adopt pre-defined transfer pricing margins for international transactions, reducing litigation and compliance burdens. If an assessee opts for safe harbour and their declared price meets the prescribed margin/circumstances, the income-tax authorities will accept it, avoiding transfer pricing audits. Covered transactions include provision of software development services, IT-enabled services, Knowledge Process Outsourcing (KPO), loans to wholly-owned subsidiaries, corporate guarantees, contract R&D, and low-value intra-group services. These rules provide a safe, predetermined framework, allowing companies to avoid lengthy, complex audits. The budget has clubbed multiple services under a single category of information technology services with a common safe harbour margin of 15.5%. Safe harbour threshold for IT services has been increased from Rs 300 crore to Rs 2,000 crore. Approval of safe harbour for IT services would be an automated rule-driven process and the budget has allowed continuation of safe harbour for a period of five years at the company’s choice. The overall IT sector would see these developments as positive and would benefit stocks like TCS, Infosys, Wipro etc. For more research articles, visit our Moneycontrol Research page",Approval of safe harbour for IT services would be an automated rule-driven process and the budget has allowed continuation of safe harbour for a period of five years at the company’s choice.,Approval of safe harbour for IT services would be an automated rule-driven process and the budget has allowed continuation of safe harbour for a period of five years at the company’s choice.,"Safe Harbour rules in India are Income Tax regulations (Section 92CB) that allow taxpayers to adopt pre-defined transfer pricing margins for international transactions, reducing litigation and compliance burdens.",Approval of safe harbour for IT services would be an automated rule-driven process and the budget has allowed continuation of safe harbour for a period of five years at the company’s choice.,neutral,0.8657447695732117
"VIX rising 11% even after Budget indicates traders are bracing for volatility, say market analysts",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/vix-rising-11-even-after-budget-indicates-traders-are-bracing-for-volatility-say-market-analysts-13803806.html,"Indian stock markets crashed on February 1 after the Union Budget. India VIX, which measures near-term market volatility, jumped nearly 11 percent to 15.09. After Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman concluded her Budget speech, Sensex crashed more than 2,370 points (around 2.9 percent) to hit an intraday low of 79,899.42. Nifty 50 meanwhile plunged nearly 750 points (around 3 percent) to its low of 24,571.75. During this time, India VIX jumped more than 18 percent to hit an 8-month high of 16.11. The benchmark indices then staged a strong recovery, followed by sharp crash again. Vix too remained volatile during the session. At close, Sensex fell nearly 1,547 points (around 1.9 percent) to end the session at 80,722.94. Nifty 50 meanwhile plunged over 495 points (nearly 2 percent) to close at 24,825.45. Here's what analysts say: A high VIX index after the Budget does not necessarily mean that further crash is imminent, but it does indicate that traders are preparing for volatility rather than a smooth ride, said Pranav Koomar, Founder and CEO of PlusCash. “VIX measures the volatility of the market over a short term, and if it remains high, it indicates that there is uncertainty about the macroeconomic indicators, fiscal policies, and money flows,” the analyst explained. While the Budget may have addressed key growth and fiscal priorities, a strong volatility index suggests investors remain cautious about near-term triggers such as global interest rate movements, earnings follow-through and geopolitical developments, said Kalp Jain, Research Analyst, INVasset PMS. Koomar added that stock markets can witness extreme intraday movements in such a scenario. “For investors, this means that they need to focus on quality and stick to their stop-loss strategy,” he concluded. “A persistently elevated VIX after the Budget signals that markets are still pricing in uncertainty despite the policy clarity provided,” said Kalp Jain, Research Analyst, INVasset PMS, adding that in such phases, markets often become more selective rather than directional. “For equities, this typically translates into higher stock-specific volatility and sharper reactions to results or news flow, even if the broader trend remains intact,” he further said. The analyst however explained that a firm VIX does not necessarily imply a bearish outlook, but it does indicate that confidence has not fully stabilised. “Until volatility eases, markets may continue to see rotational moves, with investors favouring balance-sheet strength, earnings visibility and defensiveness over broad-based risk-taking,” he said. Why markets crashed today? While presenting Budget 2026, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman raised STT on futures to 0.05 percent from 0.02 percent. This was seen as a significant reason for the market crash today, as investors on the contrary had expected significant relief on this front. For every Rs 1 lakh worth of futures sold, traders will now pay Rs 20 in STT instead of the previous Rs 12.50, explained Ashish Singhal, Co-founder of Lemonn. For a Rs 10,000 option contract sale, STT increased to Rs 10 from Rs 6.25, he added. “As the current STT framework does not differentiate between various categories of users or the purpose of derivative usage, genuine hedging activity is subject to the same higher costs as speculative trading. This uniform treatment could discourage some investors from employing prudent hedging strategies, effectively increasing their exposure to market risk and making portfolio protection more expensive,” the analyst said. ""The steep increase in STT on futures and options, coming on top of last year’s hike, is likely to raise impact costs for traders, hedgers, and arbitrageurs. This could cool derivative activity and lead to a reduction in volumes. The intent appears to be volume moderation rather than revenue maximisation, as any potential revenue gain could be offset by lower derivative volumes,"" said Shripal Shah, MD & CEO, Kotak Securities. The absence of significant incentives for foreign investors, who have withdrawn $23 billion from local equities since the start of 2025, also hurt sentiment.

The Nifty Realty index declined over 2 percent on Friday, erasing all the gains made over the previous four sessions, during which it had risen 2.15 percent. Industry body CREDAI expressed disappointment over the Budget announcements, citing the lack of concrete measures for affordable housing. ""CREDAI is deeply disappointed that the Budget offers nothing concrete for affordable housing. With the current outdated definition of affordable housing, CREDAI estimates that the segment’s share could decline further from 18 percent to nearly 12 percent of total housing supply.

Godrej Properties, DLF, Oberoi Realty and Signatureglobal (India) were among other stocks that declined up to 5 percent. Meanwhile, some industry players said the Budget’s focus on infrastructure and regional development could support the sector over the longer term. Gurpal Singh Chawla, Managing Director of TREVOC Group, said the emphasis on funding for Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities was a positive step. He noted that the City Economic Regions framework and continued push for capital expenditure would gradually strengthen real estate fundamentals beyond metro markets, though immediate demand impact may be limited. The Union Budget 2026 raised public capital expenditure to Rs 12.2 lakh crore and announced the introduction of the Infrastructure Risk Guarantee Fund, reinforcing the government’s focus on infrastructure-led growth. Industry players said these measures could improve execution visibility and liquidity across real estate segments. Manoj Gaur, Chairman and Managing Director of Gaurs Group, said the Budget’s emphasis on infrastructure and financial stability would help sustain momentum seen in the sector in recent years. Amit Modi, Director of County Group, said the Infrastructure Risk Guarantee Fund would improve funding confidence and reduce execution risks for long-gestation projects. ANAROCK Group Chairman Anuj Puri, however, said the Budget provided limited direct relief to the real estate sector, with benefits largely coming through higher capital expenditure and related initiatives in manufacturing, MSMEs, tourism, transport infrastructure and green transition.

Mahindra Group CEO Anish Shah hails Budget 2026 as 'outstanding' for manufacturing and growth,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/mahindra-group-ceo-anish-shah-hails-budget-2026-as-outstanding-for-manufacturing-and-growth-alpha-article-13803226.html,"Anish Shah, the Chief Executive Officer of the Mahindra Group, has lauded the Union Budget 2026, describing it as an ""excellent"" and ""outstanding"" fiscal plan that strongly supports India's economic expansion. In an interview with CNBC TV18, Shah emphasized the budget's critical focus on sustaining manufacturing, which he identified as central to India's ambition to grow at a rapid pace. Shah connected the budget's provisions directly to the 'Viksit Bharat' vision, which aims for manufacturing to constitute 25% of the economy. He noted that achieving this target requires manufacturing to grow 16 times over the next 22 years. According to him, the budget lays down significant details and infrastructure support that will serve as a ""huge boost"" to the sector. Another key theme highlighted by Shah was 'Atma Nirbharata' or self-reliance, which he deemed essential given the current global volatility. He specifically praised the proposed rare earth corridor as a ""great step in that direction."" Furthermore, Shah commended the budget's commitment to inclusion, pointing to the focus on inclusion, including SMEs, MSMEs, small and marginal farmers, youth, capacity building, and women, as integral components for driving overall economic growth. Regarding the direct impact on his conglomerate, Shah stated that the budget helps the Mahindra Group remain on its ""very rapid growth path."" He explained that as the budget enhances India's competitiveness in manufacturing, it enables the group to further its 'make in India for the world' strategy and also attracts more foreign companies to the country.

The tax shock for cigarette companies continues in India Budget 2026,https://www.moneycontrol.com/budget/the-tax-shock-for-cigarette-companies-continues-in-india-budget-2026-article-13803694.html,"The Union Budget 2026 has hiked NCCD (National Calamity Contingent Duty) rate on chewing tobacco, jarda scented tobacco and others to 60% from 25%, effective May 2026. NCCD is a kind of excise duty, which is levied to finance disaster relief and other national calamities. The revised GST (Goods and Services Tax) tax rate of 40% (earlier 28%) is being implemented from February 01, 2026. The new structure also replaces the old Basic Excise Duty (BED) of Rs 5-10 per 1,000 cigarette stick (depending on the size of the stick) to Rs 2100-8,500, to be charged on the retail sales price (RSP). The major regulatory overhaul is projected to significantly increase tax incidence (projected between 40-50 percent), The sharp spike in the NCCD rate will further increase the overall tax incidence for key cigarette players. The implementation of new GST rate and higher BED, in addition to the unexpected and unfavorable change in the NCCD has triggered a sell-off in major cigarette stocks -- ITC, Godfrey Phillips. The ITC stock fell by around 15 percent, while the Godfrey Phillips’s stock plummeted by more than 12 percent in the past one month. These cigarette players will have to take price hikes in the 25-40 percent range to pass on the overall impact to consumers in order to offset the higher tax burden. The high tax increases will severely affect the core tobacco business volume growth, and could compress margins and impact overall profitability across the cigarette portfolio in the near term. The ensuing lower affordability could also drive illicit cigarette trade and weaken the competitive position. In a nutshell, a stable taxation regime/thesis is over for the cigarettes industry.

What's good and bad in Budget 2026 for stock markets? Here's what analysts say,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/what-s-good-and-bad-in-budget-2026-for-stock-markets-here-s-what-analysts-say-13803700.html,"Indian stock markets saw significant decline on February 1 after Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented Union Budget 2026 in the Lok Sabha. Analysts have pointed out what bothered the markets, while what triggered pockets of buying during the trading session. Sensex fell nearly 1,547 points (around 1.9 percent) to end the session at 80,722.94. Nifty 50 meanwhile plunged over 495 points (nearly 2 percent) to close at 24,825.45. What’s good in the Budget for the markets? Despite the sharp selloff, markets did see some recovery in between. This was driven by several positive announcements in the Budget. Buyback to be taxed as capital gains: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on February 1 proposed to tax buyback for all shareholders as capital gains. She however added that promoters will pay an additional buyback tax. Amit Gupta, Partner at Saraf and Partners, said buyback taxation was again tweaked back to being characterized as capital gain. ""The buyback taxation regime was revamped in past budgets wherein entire amount received through buy-back was to be taxed as dividend for preventing promoter profit extraction and abuse. This recalcitration as capital gains is a welcome change and would pacify the concerns of taxpayers around buy-back route taxation,"" the expert said. As a result, the shares of IT companies, who are known to have declared most of the major buybacks, gained in trade. Wipro and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) shares rose around 2 percent each. LTIMindtree, Persistent Systems and Infosys shares also ended the session in the green. Tourism stocks: Easy Trip, and other tourism stocks jumped after the Finance Minister announced several measures to boost the sector. She proposed to develop 15 archaeological sites, including Sarnath and Hastinapur, into vibrant cultural destinations as part of a broader push to boost heritage tourism. She also proposed to reduce TCS rate on the sale of overseas tour programme package. While presenting the Union Budget 2026, Sitharaman said the Budget aims to reduce TCS rate on these packages from the current 5 percent and 20 percent to 2 percent without any stipulation of amount. Jewellery stocks: The shares of several jewelers surged after Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman kept rates on customs duty unchanged for import of gold and silver. EMS stocks also rose after she announced a Rs 40,000-crore outlay for the sector. Along with these measures, Finance Minister proposed to build 5 medical tourism hubs in India, pushing hospital stocks higher up. Meanwhile, textile stocks rose after she announced several measures to expand and modernise India’s textile sector, with plans to set up mega textile parks through a challenge mode framework. Fisheries and semiconductor stocks also gained in trade. What’s bad in the Budget for the markets? While presenting Budget 2026, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman raised STT on futures to 0.05 percent from 0.02 percent.

As a result of the STT hike, capital markets stocks plunged. MCX shares dropped 12 percent, while Angel One and BSE shares fell more than 8 percent each. Banking stocks: PSU Bank stocks declined sharply, pushing the Nifty Bank index down amid concerns over potential mergers and elevated government borrowing. “Govt has set up a high-level committee to review the banking sector, and this committee could potentially be mandated to look for mergers among public sector banks. Historically, bank mergers tend to create near-term drag on performance,"" said Anand Dama, head, BFSI Research, Emkay Global. No major incentive to woo foreign investors: The absence of significant incentives for foreign investors, who have withdrawn $23 billion from local equities since the start of 2025, also hurt sentiment. ""At a time when India needs to deepen market liquidity and attract global flows, raising frictional trading costs sends the opposite signal,"" said Jimeet Modi, founder and chief executive at SAMCO Group. Defence stocks: The shares of defence companies also tumbled in trade as Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s capex plans for the sector failed to meet analysts and industry’s expectations. While presenting Budget 2026, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman pegged FY27 defence expenditure at Rs 5.94 lakh crore, up from Rs 5.68 lakh crore in FY26. Defence capital expenditure has increased 21 percent year-on-year, with the allocation for defence modernisation seeing a sharper 24 percent rise over last year.

In an interview with CNBC TV18, Ramamurthy addressed market concerns, suggesting the policy change will encourage a shift from short-term trading to long-term equity investment, ultimately benefiting the Indian economy. While acknowledging that the market is 'a little worried' about the hike, Ramamurthy presented a positive outlook. He argued that the government's intention is to align and orient people towards long-term equity investing. ""Today the equity STT will be lower than F&O STT, which encourages them to get into the equities market. That is totally in alignment with the capital formation requirement of Viksit Bharat,"" he explained. When pressed on the near-term impact on the BSE's business and trading volumes, Ramamurthy said it was not possible to quantify the impact, arguing that markets are dynamic. He emphasized the dynamic and growing nature of the Indian market, suggesting that any initial negative reaction would be short-lived. ""We are presuming a static thing of a change will have an impact on a dynamic thing. And the market is dynamic and growing,"" he stated. Drawing on historical precedent, the BSE chief noted that this is not the first time such a tax increase has occurred. He recalled that in the past, the market has taken these changes in its stride and continued to grow without any significant, lasting dip in activity. ""I don't think there has been any dip. The market has taken it in its stride and it has grown. So I feel that the same thing will happen,"" Ramamurthy asserted. On other matters from the Union Budget, when asked about measures to attract Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs), he highlighted existing government efforts in addressing tariffs in key sectors like textiles and semiconductors as positive developments.

Budget 2026 shifts focus to services as India targets 10% of global output: NITI Aayog CEO,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/budget-2026-shifts-focus-to-services-as-india-targets-10-of-global-output-niti-aayog-ceo-alpha-article-13803229.html,"In a first government reaction following the Union Budget 2026 presentation, B.V.R. Subrahmanyam, the Chief Executive Officer of Niti Aayog, has characterized the fiscal blueprint as a 'services budget' designed to propel the nation towards its 'Viksit Bharat' goal. Speaking with CNBC TV18, Subrahmanyam explained that this budget builds upon the foundations laid by previous budgets, which focused on jobs and manufacturing, by placing a significant new emphasis on the services sector. Subrahmanyam labelled it a 'services budget' and detailed several key announcements to support his assessment. He highlighted the proposed establishment of a high-level standing committee on services, which is expected to drive reforms across more than 30 ministries. ""If there is one big area of focus in this budget, it is services,"" he stated. The Niti Aayog CEO pointed to a slew of initiatives, including the development of five medical hubs to boost medical tourism, the creation of five 'university cities' to serve as integrated education hubs with research parks and manufacturing, and a major push for tourism and Ayush, with three new All India Institutes of Ayush planned. He also noted the focus on the 'orange economy' through the Indian Institute of Creative Technology and the goal of making India a global services hub, targeting 10% of the world's services output. While championing the services focus, Subrahmanyam clarified that manufacturing continues to be a priority. He explained that the budget builds on the work of the previous year's National Manufacturing Mission, which he said is in its final stages. Key manufacturing-related announcements include the expansion of the electronic component scheme from ₹25,000 crore to ₹40,000 crore and a continued emphasis on labour-intensive sectors like textiles and sports goods, alongside a new container program. On the taxation front, Subrahmanyam observed that the government has opted for 'tinkering' to remove 'minor pain points' for businesses rather than pursuing broad import duty rationalization, noting that numerous Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) are already lowering tariffs. A key measure targeting foreign direct investment is the expansion of 'safe harbor' rules for companies with turnovers up to ₹2,000 crore, with a fixed rate of 15%. This move is expected to benefit approximately 1,600 Global Capability Centers (GCCs). He also mentioned the establishment of a committee to review foreign exchange debt borrowing rules, aiming to attract debt flows in addition to equity investments. Significant infrastructure development was another core pillar identified by Subrahmanyam. He detailed the plan for 'City Economic Regions,' a Niti Aayog initiative backed by a ₹5,000 crore challenge fund, which he said could help cities like Mumbai and Surat aspire to become global hubs. A major connectivity project announced is a new East-West dedicated freight corridor from Dankuni (near Kolkata) to Surat. ""This is going to give a big boost to industrial and other services growth in Eastern India,"" he remarked. The budget also reinforces the commitment to seven high-speed rail corridors. Regarding the proposed restructuring of Power Finance Corporation (PFC) and Rural Electrification Corporation (REC), Subrahmanyam said he would need more clarity, but viewed the move as potentially enabling to funnel green and climate finance into India's energy and transport sectors.","""If there is one big area of focus in this budget, it is services,"" he stated.","The Niti Aayog CEO pointed to a slew of initiatives, including the development of five medical hubs to boost medical tourism, the creation of five 'university cities' to serve as integrated education hubs with research parks and manufacturing, and a major push for tourism and Ayush, with three new All India Institutes of Ayush planned.","He highlighted the proposed establishment of a high-level standing committee on services, which is expected to drive reforms across more than 30 ministries.","The Niti Aayog CEO pointed to a slew of initiatives, including the development of five medical hubs to boost medical tourism, the creation of five 'university cities' to serve as integrated education hubs with research parks and manufacturing, and a major push for tourism and Ayush, with three new All India Institutes of Ayush planned.",positive,0.8210946917533875

The launch of Semiconductor Mission 2.0 (ISM 2.0), alongside a near-doubling of the Electronics Components Manufacturing Scheme outlay to Rs.40,000 crore, underscores the government’s intent to localise equipment, materials, components, and semiconductor IP. This policy push is reinforced by hard fiscal backing, with government semiconductor spending raised to Rs.8,000 crore in FY27 (from Rs.4,300 crore) and the MeitY allocation increased to Rs.21,633 crore, improving execution visibility. Further, BCD on mobile phones, PCBA, and chargers has been reduced from 20% to 15%, enhancing cost competitiveness and supporting deeper domestic value addition. Along with BCD exemptions across semiconductor & display manufacturing, solar equipment, and consumer electronics have been extended up to FY28, covering key machinery, components, and inputs. This provides long-term capex visibility for fabs and ensures cost stability while accelerating localisation for EMS and appliance players. On-ground traction is visible. Across three rounds of ECMS approvals, cumulative investment commitments stand at ~ Rs.54,500 crore, spanning PCBs, camera modules, display and copper clad laminates, and advanced components. Among listed players, Kaynes Technology has emerged as a key early beneficiary with approvals across multi-layer & HDI PCBs, camera modules, and copper clad laminates, positioning it well for backend semiconductor and high-value EMS. Amber Enterprises has secured broad approvals via subsidiaries and JVs across multilayer and HDI PCBs, strengthening backward integration. A 10% import duty on AC components (excluding indoor and outdoor units) is also supportive for domestic manufacturers, benefiting Amber Enterprises. Syrma SGS Technology has approvals for multi-layer PCBs and camera modules, with upside pending approvals in HDI/flex PCBs and laminates, while Dixon Technologies has approvals for camera modules and optical transceivers, with additional component categories still under evaluation. Parallelly, large integrated initiatives led by Tata Electronics and OSAT players are moving from construction to commissioning, with 10 semiconductor manufacturing and packaging projects approved involving ~ Rs.1.6 lakh crore of investments.

Senco Gold shares rose 1.5 percent. Currently, import of gold in all forms attracts a 6 percent duty, including 5 percent basic customs duty (BCD) and 1 percent agriculture infrastructure and development cess (AIDC). Silver imports are taxed at 6 percent for eligible Indian residents, while others pay 36 percent, comprising 35 percent basic customs duty and 1 percent AIDC. Both metals attract a uniform GST of 3 percent. The Centre had slashed the customs duty on gold from 15 percent to 6 percent with effect from July 24, 2024. Although there was some confusion earlier when the Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced that “the tariff rate on all dutiable goods imported for personal use would be reduced from 20 per cent to 10 per cent,” market experts have clarified that it will not include the import of gold and silver jewellery, or any other precious metals. “The bullion industry had expected a cut in import duty on gold, GST rationalisation, export incentives and extended credit support.

Budget firepower for Defence sector: Significantly higher allocation to boost domestic firms’ revenue visibility,https://www.moneycontrol.com/budget/budget-firepower-for-defence-sector-significantly-higher-allocation-to-boost-domestic-firms-revenue-visibility-article-13803409.html,"The Union Budget FY2026-27 marks a clear inflection point for India’s defence ecosystem, with a decisive shift towards higher capital spending, indigenisation, and private-sector innovation. This aggressive allocation, part of a broader Rs 7.846 Lakh Crore total defense budget (a 15.2% increase from FY26BE), provides the long-term visibility required for multi-year procurement cycles. Importantly, the capital outlay has been increased to Rs 2.31 Lakh Crore (FY27BE) —a massive 20.1 percent jump from the previous year’s budget estimates of Rs 1.92 Lakh Crore, which is quite good leading to increased visibility, modernization opportunities, and acquisition of new platforms. This is positive for the entire value chain including companies like Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) and Bharat Dynamics, Mazagon Docks, Hindustan Aeronautics and others in the supply chain like MTAR, Data Patterns, Solar Industries and others who are poised for significant order book expansion. Technology and innovation is the other important area where the budget talks about the launch of a dedicated Rs 5,000 Crore Deep-Tech Fund for private sector R&D. This is a gamechanger for lean, high-tech firms like Zen Technologies, Astra Micro which specialize in simulations and other niche areas. From the cost and supply chain point of view the budget announcements related to the full Basic Customs Duty (BCD) exemption on raw materials for aircraft parts and Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) units significantly lowers the entry barrier for domestic production. This is good for Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), as it reduces the lifecycle cost of maintaining India’s growing fleet of Tejas and Sukhoi jets. By exempting duties on civilian training aircraft parts as well, the FM has signaled to develop a greater ecosystem that feeds directly into defense pilot training and sustainment. Beyond direct allocations, the budget’s focus on Rare Earth corridors and critical mineral security—provides a fundamental backstop for the industry.

Key initiatives include support for man-made fibres (MMF), technical textiles, sustainability (Tex-Eco Initiative), skilling (Samarth 2.0) and cluster modernisation. In addition, the government extended export timelines from six months to one year for textile garments, leather products and footwear, providing operational flexibility to exporters. Budget 2026’s emphasis on end-to-end integration—from fibre to finished goods—aims to narrow India’s competitiveness gap versus peers such as Vietnam and Bangladesh, while improving India’s positioning amid China+1 sourcing diversification. Large-format parks with plug-and-play infrastructure and common testing facilities should compress lead times, lower logistics costs and improve compliance. Well-capitalised, export-oriented players with scale and compliance readiness are best placed to benefit.

Aquaculture gets a safety net in Budget 2026,https://www.moneycontrol.com/budget/aquaculture-gets-a-safety-net-in-budget-2026-article-13803310.html,"The Union Budget 2026 introduced several growth-oriented measures for the aquaculture industry. With an extensive coastline of over 5,000 km, India ranks as the world’s third-largest fish producer, accounting for approximately 8 percent of global output. The fiscal year 2024-25 saw India cement its global position as seafood exports reached an all-time high of Rs 62,408 crore, with shipments totaling 1.7 million metric tonnes. This trade was largely fueled by robust demand from the United States and China. Frozen shrimp continues to lead the sector's growth, accounting for 70 percent of total export value at over Rs 43,000 crore. In a move to bolster the sector, the budget proposed raising the duty-free import limit for specified inputs from 1 percent to 3 percent of the FOB (Free on Board) value of the previous year’s export turnover. Besides this, the government also aims to enhance the fisheries value chain by developing 500 reservoirs and Amrit Sarovars, alongside promoting self-employment in the animal husbandry sector. Despite a record-breaking FY25, the domestic shrimp industry is under significant stress following the imposition of a 50 percent tariff by the US - India’s top export destination. Although the American market remains unpredictable, the 2026 Union Budget and the recently signed India-EU Free Trade Agreement (January 2026) provide a vital support system. By focusing on cost-competitiveness and European market access, the government is utilizing the India-EU FTA as a strategic hedge to ensure industry resilience amid global geopolitical volatility. The government efforts to increase productivity and yields should foster a supportive environment for industry leaders like Avanti Feeds (the country's largest shrimp feed manufacturer) and Apex Frozen Foods (an integrated producer and exporter of frozen shrimp).

Public sector lenders bore the brunt of the sell-off amid concerns over potential mergers and elevated government borrowing. Around 2 pm, the Nifty Bank index was down 1.3 percent at 58,832. The weakness was far more pronounced in government-owned banks, with the Nifty PSU Bank index tumbling 3.8 percent, posting the steepest decline among major sectoral indices. In contrast, the Nifty Private Bank index slipped a relatively modest 0.9 percent. All 12 constituents of the PSU Bank index were trading in the red. State Bank of India fell 3.6 percent, while Bank of Baroda slid 4.7 percent and Union Bank of India declined 4.2 percent. Punjab National Bank was down 2.2 percent and Canara Bank shed 2 percent, with several other PSU lenders such as Bank of India, Bank of Maharashtra and Indian Bank falling between 4 and 6 percent. Live Updates | Union Budget 2026 Private lenders also saw losses, though to a lesser extent. ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Bandhan Bank and IDFC First Bank were down in the range of 1 to 4 percent. AU Small Finance Bank was the lone gainer in the broader banking pack, edging up 0.3 percent. Market participants pointed to Budget-linked concerns weighing disproportionately on PSU banks. The government’s announcement of a high-level committee to review the banking sector has revived speculation around consolidation among public sector lenders. “Historically, bank mergers tend to create a near-term drag on performance,” said Anand Dama, head of BFSI Research at Emkay Global, as cited by Reuters. In addition, the government’s plan to borrow a record Rs 17.2 trillion in 2026-27 -- above most market expectations -- has added to the pressure. Higher gross market borrowings could keep bond yields elevated, potentially hurting treasury gains for PSU banks, Dama added. The sharp correction comes despite a strong run-up in PSU banking stocks last month. The PSU Bank index had risen 5.7 percent in January, even as the benchmark Nifty 50 fell 3.1 percent, making the segment vulnerable to profit-taking on Budget day.

Union Budget 2026 – How does E2E Networks stand to gain?,https://www.moneycontrol.com/budget/union-budget-2026-how-does-e2e-networks-stand-to-gain-article-13803287.html,"The Union Budget 2026 has proposed a tax holiday for any foreign company offering cloud services to global customers using data centre infrastructure in India. These companies will still be required to serve Indian customers through an Indian reseller entity. The move underscores the government’s intent to strengthen domestic digital infrastructure by attracting foreign investment into India’s cloud ecosystem, while also preserving data sovereignty. E2E Networks, India’s only listed, homegrown GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) cloud platform, emerges as an indirect beneficiary of this policy shift. While the tax holiday is not directed at domestic cloud providers, the mandate to anchor hyperscale cloud capacity in India and the push for global cloud firms to focus on export-led workloads could enhance E2E’s relative competitiveness in the price-sensitive Indian cloud and AI-compute market. Despite competition from AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, E2E has consistently competed on performance, customization, and cost efficiency. The increasing adoption of public‑private cloud, hybrid architectures, and multi-cloud strategies further positions E2E as a key enabler in India’s rapidly expanding AI compute environment. As global cloud providers expand local data centre operations to take advantage of the tax incentive, E2E, which uses colocation and leased data centre facilities, stands to gain indirectly. The resulting improvements in unit economics (Rs/kW), faster deployment cycles, and deeper integration with India’s AI-data centre ecosystem could enhance E2E’s operating leverage and credibility. Additionally, India’s rising sovereign AI compute requirements, the accelerating enterprise AI adoption, and stricter data-localisation norms - especially under the India AI Mission - are amplifying demand for domestic cloud infrastructure providers. While competitive intensity from global hyperscalers may increase and exert pricing pressure, India’s AI/ML workload expansion remains robust. The policy announcement improves India’s attractiveness as a cloud base, boosts customer confidence in local compute availability, and could strengthen positive sentiment around domestic players like E2E Networks.",The Union Budget 2026 has proposed a tax holiday for any foreign company offering cloud services to global customers using data centre infrastructure in India.,"While the tax holiday is not directed at domestic cloud providers, the mandate to anchor hyperscale cloud capacity in India and the push for global cloud firms to focus on export-led workloads could enhance E2E’s relative competitiveness in the price-sensitive Indian cloud and AI-compute market.","The policy announcement improves India’s attractiveness as a cloud base, boosts customer confidence in local compute availability, and could strengthen positive sentiment around domestic players like E2E Networks.","While the tax holiday is not directed at domestic cloud providers, the mandate to anchor hyperscale cloud capacity in India and the push for global cloud firms to focus on export-led workloads could enhance E2E’s relative competitiveness in the price-sensitive Indian cloud and AI-compute market.",positive,0.9521113038063049

India Budget 2026: Capital market participants hit by increase in STT,https://www.moneycontrol.com/budget/india-budget-2026-capital-market-participants-hit-by-increase-in-stt-article-13803199.html,"What Budget proposed? The Union Budget 2026 has raised the STT (securities transaction tax) on Futures to 0.05 percent from present 0.02 percent. STT on options premium and exercise of options are both proposed to be raised to 0.15 percent from the present rate of 0.1 percent and 0.125 percent respectively. Why the hike in STT? There has been rising chatter that the government is exploring measures to curb the surge in retail participation in derivatives trading over the past couple of years. Last year, SEBI warned that nearly 9 out of 10 options traders lose money. The Budget announcement follows repeated cautions over an “unchecked explosion” in retail F&O activity and a series of regulatory actions by SEBI. Who will be impacted the most? The government’s hike in STT on F&O is set to hurt derivatives turnover by making F&O less attractive for retail traders. This will directly dent trading volumes and profitability for exchanges. BSE, which has rapidly gained F&O market share since April 2023, is vulnerable to volume-led earnings hit, while NSE too faces near-term negatives as it prepares for its IPO even though it has a very big presence in cash equity market segment which will not be impacted by the Budget. Investors should note that SEBI has been contemplating to potentially scrap weekly options which could be another blow for exchanges. The impact will be more severe for brokers—particularly discount brokers that are heavily dependent on retail derivatives activity. After regulatory tightening in past 18 months, the latest Budget adds another layer of policy overhang, intensifying concerns for the broking industry. With discount brokers now commanding 76–78% of active NSE clients in FY25 (up from ~40% in FY20 and under 10% in FY15), this segment stands to lose the most from the Budget measures. Listed players such as Angel One and newly listed Billionbrains Garage Ventures (Groww) are likely to be hit harder. Who will be impacted less? Wealth managers like 360 ONE Wealth that have diversified revenue stream consisting more of distribution income will be least impacted as broking income forms small portion of their revenue.",The government’s hike in STT on F&O is set to hurt derivatives turnover by making F&O less attractive for retail traders.,STT on options premium and exercise of options are both proposed to be raised to 0.15 percent from the present rate of 0.1 percent and 0.125 percent respectively.,The Budget announcement follows repeated cautions over an “unchecked explosion” in retail F&O activity and a series of regulatory actions by SEBI.,STT on options premium and exercise of options are both proposed to be raised to 0.15 percent from the present rate of 0.1 percent and 0.125 percent respectively.,positive,0.8020376563072205

IFCI currently has an effective, indirect stake of approximately 2.35 percent in the NSE through its majority ownership of Stock Holding Corporation of India (SHCIL). Hence, rising expectations of a strong valuation for NSE after its IPO may have boosted the stock. SEBI gives NOC for NSE IPO: Market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) on Friday had issued a No Objection Certificate (NOC) for NSE to apply for IPO, sources told Moneycontrol.

The discussion also brought a significant update from Ashishkumar Chauhan, Managing Director and CEO of the National Stock Exchange (NSE), who expressed hope that the NSE could be listed by this year's Diwali Muhurat trading session. Nilesh Shah of Kotak Mahindra AMC laid out a formidable challenge for the Finance Minister, terming it the 'Trinity of impossible'. His wishlist includes continuing government spending on infrastructure investment while private investment remains subdued, honouring the commitment to reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio, and achieving this by boosting non-tax revenue through asset monetization and divestment, rather than raising taxes. Extending this theme, Shah proposed creating a 'DG Yatra for entrepreneurs', a system analogous to the seamless airport entry process, to streamline and accelerate both foreign and local investments. Live Updates | Share market on Budget day; Sensex, Nifty news Echoing the need for policy stability, Gautam Chhaochharia of UBS stated his primary expectation from the budget is for there to be “no negative surprises.” He emphasized the importance of a long-term plan backed by specific policies to provide clarity and stability. Chhaochharia also noted that market participants are hoping for positive surprises, such as potential tax cuts for foreign portfolio investors (FPIs). Delving deeper into the FPI issue, Nilesh Shah highlighted a key anomaly in the current tax structure. He pointed out that many foreign entities, such as endowment and pension funds, are tax-exempt in their home countries but are required to pay taxes in India. “While our returns could be higher on a post-tax basis, there is a mindset issue where I don't pay tax in my country, how can I pay tax in another country,” Shah explained. He proposed a rationalization of this policy by extending the capital gains tax exemptions, currently available to sovereign funds from countries like Singapore and the Middle East, to all FPIs that are tax-exempt in their own jurisdictions. On the topic of the Securities Transaction Tax (STT), NSE chief Ashishkumar Chauhan acknowledged that such a tax is known to create friction in markets. However, he provided the government's perspective, noting that STT generates substantial revenue, estimated at ₹60,000-70,000 crore annually. He stressed that any relaxation or abolishment of STT would be a balancing act for the government, which would need to find alternative sources for these funds. When asked about the sectoral priority for the budget to drive the investment climate, Nilesh Shah offered a one-word answer: “Liberalization.” He argued that liberalizing the environment for entrepreneurs would be the most effective way to spur growth, allowing them to identify and pursue opportunities.","The discussion also brought a significant update from Ashishkumar Chauhan, Managing Director and CEO of the National Stock Exchange (NSE), who expressed hope that the NSE could be listed by this year's Diwali Muhurat trading session.","He proposed a rationalization of this policy by extending the capital gains tax exemptions, currently available to sovereign funds from countries like Singapore and the Middle East, to all FPIs that are tax-exempt in their own jurisdictions.","However, he provided the government's perspective, noting that STT generates substantial revenue, estimated at ₹60,000-70,000 crore annually.","When asked about the sectoral priority for the budget to drive the investment climate, Nilesh Shah offered a one-word answer: “Liberalization.” He argued that liberalizing the environment for entrepreneurs would be the most effective way to spur growth, allowing them to identify and pursue opportunities.",positive,0.6536979675292969

"Budget 2026: Rupee shouldn't be at 92, says Jahangir Aziz; weakness due to capital flows shortfall, not growth",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/budget-2026-rupee-shouldn-t-be-at-92-says-jahangir-aziz-weakness-due-to-capital-flows-shortfall-not-growth-alpha-article-13802286.html,"The Indian rupee's recent and swift depreciation to the 92 level has become a significant point of concern, especially when viewed against the country's robust economic fundamentals. Economist Jahangir Aziz, in a discussion with CNBC TV18, broke down this paradox, arguing that the currency's weakness is not driven by economic performance but by a critical shortfall in capital flows. Aziz began by highlighting the strong macroeconomic indicators that should theoretically support the rupee. He pointed to an official gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate between 7.5% and 8%, inflation dropping below 3% after a prolonged period, and a manageable current account deficit (CAD) of just 1% of GDP. Coupled with oil prices at a low of $55 per barrel and trending downward, he asserted that from a fundamental standpoint, the ""rupee shouldn't be at 92."" Live updates | Union Budget 2026 The central problem, Aziz diagnosed, lies in the inability to finance even a modest deficit. ""If India ever achieved 1% of GDP of current account deficit, that would have been seen as an exceedingly good year. Today we can't fund 1% of GDP. Not too long ago, we were funding two and a half, 3% of GDP,"" he explained. This stark contrast points directly to a problem with the capital account, affecting both Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI). Diving deeper into the issue, Aziz suggested the FDI story is more complex than a general global slowdown. While gross FDI may appear stable, the critical issue is a lack of reinvestment from key players. Based on anecdotal evidence from market participants, he identified a specific trend among private equity (PE) firms. According to Aziz, many PE firms that invested in India five to six years ago and achieved successful exits through Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) are now choosing not to reinvest their proceeds back into the country. This lack of reinvestment from entities whose primary business is risk-taking raises a fundamental question. ""The question that you need to ask is why are institutions or why are agencies, firms whose only job is to take risk, no longer taking risk on India,"" Aziz concluded. This suggests that the rupee's weakness may be a symptom of shifting investor confidence and risk perception rather than a reflection of underlying economic health.","While gross FDI may appear stable, the critical issue is a lack of reinvestment from key players.","""The question that you need to ask is why are institutions or why are agencies, firms whose only job is to take risk, no longer taking risk on India,"" Aziz concluded.","While gross FDI may appear stable, the critical issue is a lack of reinvestment from key players.","He pointed to an official gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate between 7.5% and 8%, inflation dropping below 3% after a prolonged period, and a manageable current account deficit (CAD) of just 1% of GDP.",negative,0.964445948600769

"How Budget 2026 can bring FPIs back into India: Tackle tax 'irritants' for foreign investors, says Arvind Sanger",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/how-budget-2026-can-bring-fpis-back-into-india-tackle-tax-irritants-for-foreign-investors-says-arvind-sanger-alpha-article-13802283.html,"To attract foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) back to its shores, India needs to address specific tax “irritants” and ensure policy stability, rather than relying on the assumption that global capital has no other option, according to Arvind Sanger, Managing Partner at Geosphere Capital Management. Speaking on CNBC TV18 ahead of the Union Budget, Sanger said the focus should be on supply-side reforms to revive economic activity, even if that involves some short-term fiscal leeway. Sanger identified the tax charged at the fund level in India as a significant deterrent for FPIs, describing it as “pretty unique” and “punitive”. He explained that for investors from countries without a double taxation avoidance agreement, this results in being taxed twice—once at the India fund level and again at the personal level in their home country. The discussion also touched upon the idea of exempting sovereign and endowment funds from long-term capital gains tax, which was presented as politically easier to sell than a blanket exemption for all FPIs. Live Updates | Union Budget 2026 According to Sanger, the Union Budget has become “way less important” than it once was, with major reforms increasingly taking place outside the annual budget cycle. He said continued supply-side reform was needed to encourage growth, and that policymakers should not be overly focused on short-term fiscal metrics. Drawing a parallel with GST cuts that could temporarily impact collections, Sanger argued that some fiscal flexibility may be necessary to revive economic activity, while stressing that he was not advocating reckless fiscal expansion. Sanger also said India has come to be viewed as the “anti-AI trade”, calling it a “very narrow space to occupy”. While there may be phases when the global AI trade unwinds and India benefits, he cautioned that the country needs to stand on its own growth fundamentals. He warned against the belief that foreign investors have no alternative but India, noting that markets such as Korea, Taiwan and China are seen as beneficiaries of the AI cycle. On policy credibility, Sanger flagged concerns around retroactive changes, citing a recent Supreme Court decision on back taxes as another irritant for foreign investors. He said such actions undermine confidence by creating uncertainty over whether existing rules will continue to apply in the future, adding that this was not how an economy of India’s stature should function.","To attract foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) back to its shores, India needs to address specific tax “irritants” and ensure policy stability, rather than relying on the assumption that global capital has no other option, according to Arvind Sanger, Managing Partner at Geosphere Capital Management.","Speaking on CNBC TV18 ahead of the Union Budget, Sanger said the focus should be on supply-side reforms to revive economic activity, even if that involves some short-term fiscal leeway.","He said such actions undermine confidence by creating uncertainty over whether existing rules will continue to apply in the future, adding that this was not how an economy of India’s stature should function.","To attract foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) back to its shores, India needs to address specific tax “irritants” and ensure policy stability, rather than relying on the assumption that global capital has no other option, according to Arvind Sanger, Managing Partner at Geosphere Capital Management.",neutral,0.6692772507667542

Accordingly, the prescribed price band of 20 percent on both upper and lower end shall be applicable to the said T- 1 NAV price for trading purposes, BSE said. What lies ahead? Last week’s sharp fall in gold and silver prices can be explained as a classic bout of profit-booking after an extended record rally and not as a breakdown in fundamental sentiments, said Pranav Koomar, Founder and CEO of PlusCash.

Investors should consider any fall as a buying opportunity and not a sign of any change in the trend, Koomar said. Maneesh Sharma, AVP - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers, noted that the sharp moves in precious metals seen today reflected speculation that Warsh may be less enthusiastic to cut rates than other candidates, given his past warnings of inflation risks and more recent calls for the Fed to reduce its balance sheet.

Additionally, a key announcement in Budget 2026 also pushed the stocks down. ITC shares fell more than 3 percent to Rs 311.6 apiece, while Godfrey Phillips India shares declined more than 2 percent to Rs 1,990.50 apiece. The shares of the two cigarette-makers had dropped more than 11 percent in January after the government notified that the excise duty hike will be imposed from February 1. Additionally, Budget 2026 which was presented today by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the Parliament, hiked NCCD rate on chewing tobacco, jarda scented tobacco and others to 60 percent from 25 percent from May 2026. This will likely be a major regulatory overhang for the cigarette companies as well. Central Excise (Amendment) Bill, 2025: The Parliament in December last year approved the Central Excise (Amendment) Bill, 2025, clearing the way for a sharp increase in duties on cigarettes and other tobacco products. It replaces a temporary levy on cigarettes and tobacco products. The excise duty would be imposed on cigarettes in addition to a 40 percent GST, according to an order issued late on Wednesday. The finance ministry notified that an excise duty of Rs 2,050–8,500 per 1,000 sticks, depending on cigarette length, will take effect from February 1. Total taxes on cigarettes in India currently account for about 53 percent of the retail prices, well below the World Health Organization (WHO) benchmark of 75 percent which is aimed at discouraging consumption. This includes a 28 percent goods and services tax and additional value-based levy based on the size of the cigarettes. The duty translates into a 22-28 percent increase in overall costs for 75-85 mm cigarettes, analysts at ICICI Securities said. ""Cigarettes longer than 75 mm account for roughly 16% of ITC's volumes and are likely to see price increases of 2–3 rupees per stick as a result of the levy,"" they said. Cigarette stocks: ITC shares had declined nearly 17 percent during a nine-day losing streak between January 1 and January 13. Prabhudas Lilladher in its latest research report lowered its target price for the shares of ITC to Rs 314 apiece from Rs 348 earlier, while maintaining its ‘Reduce’ call. The latest target price implies a downside potential of more than 1 percent from the stock’s previous closing price of Rs 318.6 apiece. The domestic brokerage said that it remains “cautious” on the cigarettes segment, as it expects a 22–50% price increase due to new excise rates which could impact volumes and profitability in the near term. “However, we expect ITC to do well in other category given 1) likely decline in wood prices and benefits of MIP imposition in paper board 2) expected further recovery in demand and margins in FMCG business led by favorable macro policies.

The index closed 0.58 percent (more than 347 points) lower at 59,610.45 on Friday, led by losses in Canara Bank, ICICI Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and others. The index however recorded 0.74 percent gains in January overall. The index snapped a three-session gaining streak on January 30. What lies ahead? Despite facing early selling pressure on Friday, the index displayed notable resilience by defending its crucial support zone and sustaining above the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA), said Dhupesh Dhameja, Derivatives Research Analyst, SAMCO Securities. This price behaviour has gradually shifted the near-term bias in favour of the bulls, he further said, adding that the index appears well-placed for a healthier recovery from a technical perspective. “The improving price behaviour lends credibility to the ongoing recovery attempt. A sustained move above 60,100 could inject fresh momentum into the uptrend. The 60,100–60,300 band, which previously acted as a strong demand zone, has now evolved into a key supply area and overlaps with the prior all-time-high supply zone. This confluence makes it a critical inflection point for the index,” the analyst said. Osho Krishan, Chief Manager -Technical and Derivative research at Angel One, sees the Bank Nifty finding support at 59,200 and then at 58,700 on the downside, and resistance at 60,000 and then at 60,400 on the upside. “Bank Nifty has reclaimed its falling trendline breakout zone and is now sustaining above its short-term 20-day and 50-day moving averages, indicating improving price structure. Momentum indicators are also supportive, with RSI witnessing a bullish crossover, suggesting strengthening upside bias. However, on the derivatives front, the 60000 strike holds the highest open interest from both call and put writers, making it a crucial pivot level. Being a high-beta index, volatility is expected, with support placed at 59000 and resistance near 60400 levels,” said Vatsal Bhuva, Technical Analyst at LKP Securities. Aakash Shah, Technical Research Analyst at Choice Broking said that technical indicators suggest a “cautiously optimistic outlook” for Bank Nifty. “The index demonstrated notable strength by decisively breaking above the key resistance at 59,500 and forming a bullish piercing pattern on the weekly timeframe, which signals a potential bullish reversal and improving market sentiment,” he said. The analyst cautioned that if selling pressure re-emerges and the index fails to sustain above 59,500, a decisive breakdown could trigger a deeper corrective move towards the 59,000–58,500 zone, with the risk of further downside extension. “On the upside, immediate resistance is placed at 60,000, followed by 60,200 and 60,400,” he added. “The pullback appears to have offered a healthy buying opportunity rather than a trend reversal. The daily RSI stands near 52, indicating neutral to improving momentum with room for further upside…On the downside, the 59300–59250 zone remains a crucial support; a decisive break below this range could drag the index toward 58700. On the upside, 60000 is a key psychological resistance, with sustained strength above it opening the path toward 60500.

The reported profit came in marginally below Street estimates due to a one-off labour code adjustment. Brokerages noted improving demand, robust margins and strong operational performance, but cautioned about elevated valuation levels. Bajaj Auto reported an 18.6 percent year-on-year rise in net profit to Rs 2,502 crore, slightly below the CNBC-TV18 poll estimate. Revenue grew 18.8 percent to Rs 15,220 crore, crossing the Rs 15,000-crore quarterly milestone for the first time. EBITDA rose 22.5 percent on-year to Rs 3,161 crore, beating estimates. On a pre-exceptional basis, profit after tax crossed Rs 2,500 crore for the first time. Bajaj Auto stock call: Brokerages cite demand improvement, margin resilience Brokerages broadly agreed that Bajaj Auto’s operational momentum remains strong, which fuels medium-term confidence in the stock outlook. But views diverge on how much upside remains at current valuation levels. Goldman Sachs maintained a Buy rating on Bajaj Auto with a target price of Rs 11,500 per share, implying about 20 percent upside from Friday’s close. The brokerage said Q3 performance was in line, and pointed to early signs of a turnaround in domestic two-wheeler demand. It expects industry growth of 12-15 percent over the next six months, with the 125cc-plus segment outperforming, aided by multiple product refreshes and a new launch. CLSA reiterated an Outperform call with a target of Rs 11,410, highlighting the 20.8 percent EBITDA margin as broadly in line despite commodity inflation. CLSA flagged currency tailwinds aiding export realisations. It expects domestic two-wheeler growth of 12-15 percent, alongside export growth of 20-25 percent year-on-year, with margins expected to hold up in Q4 despite some commodity pressure. Nomura retained a Neutral rating with a target price of Rs 10,446, saying that margins were supported by higher PLI benefits. While it sees domestic market share recovery as a key catalyst, Nomura views valuations of around 20 times FY28 earnings as fair. Valuation concerns temper optimism at higher levels Jefferies kept a Hold rating with a cautious tone, setting a target of Rs 9,100. While positive on India two-wheeler demand and export momentum, Jefferies flagged concerns over domestic motorcycle market share loss. It also highlighted that Bajaj Auto stock trades at 24 times FY27 earnings -- a premium to its long-term average valuation of 21x. UBS maintained a Sell rating with a target price of Rs 9,015, saying that Bajaj Auto’s motorcycle-heavy mix remains a structural challenge despite a supportive industry outlook. UBS acknowledged that a three-wheeler mix and lower staff costs supported margins, and noted that electric vehicles accounted for around 25 percent of domestic revenue in Q3.

Nestle India Q3 results get mixed brokerage reviews; should you buy or sell the stock? Check target prices,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/nestle-india-q3-results-get-mixed-brokerage-reviews-should-you-buy-or-sell-the-stock-check-target-prices-13802087.html,"Brokerages were divided on the outlook for Nestle India Ltd after the FMCG major delivered a strong, volume-led performance in Q3 FY26. While analysts pointed to a sustained recovery in demand and stepped-up brand investments, concerns around near-term margin pressure and rich valuations tempered optimism on the stock. Most brokerages said Nestle India’s fiscal third-quarter performance marked one of its strongest volume upcycles in recent years, supported by broad-based growth across categories and channels. However, the sharp increase in advertising and promotion (A&P) spending -- though strategically positive -- has weighed on operating margins, limiting near-term upside expectations. Nestle India reported a strong set of Q3 FY26 results, posting an 18.5 percent year-on-year rise in revenue to a record Rs 5,667 crore and a 46 percent jump in net profit to Rs 1,018 crore, aided by a one-time tax write-back. EBITDA grew 9 percent on-year, though margins narrowed sharply due to a 42 percent surge in advertising and promotion spends. Following the results, Nestle India shares rose 3.5 percent on Friday. The stock has returned over 15 percent in one year, outperforming Nifty 50. Nestle India stock call: Brokerages offer mixed views Analysts broadly agreed that Nestle India's Q3 FY26 performance signals improving consumption trends and better demand elasticity. At the same time, they cautioned that the current phase of aggressive brand investment, while supportive of medium-term growth, could delay operating leverage. Nomura was bullish on Nestle India stock, reiterating a Buy rating with a target price of Rs 1,450 per share, implying nearly 9 percent upside from current levels. The brokerage said Nestle India delivered another clear earnings beat, driven by strong volume and mix growth of around 16 percent year-on-year. While operating margins declined due to a 42 percent on-year surge in A&P spends, Nomura noted that stable raw material costs are aiding sequential margin recovery. It also flagged valuation as a constraint, with the stock trading at around 60 times FY28 earnings. In contrast, CLSA maintained a Hold rating with a target price of Rs 1,311. The brokerage highlighted that Q3 sales growth materially exceeded expectations and was largely volume-driven, particularly in the domestic business. It said EBITDA also beat estimates despite pressure from elevated brand investments and raised Nestle India’s FY26-28 earnings estimates by 3-5 percent. Jefferies also stayed at Hold, with a target price of Rs 1,300. The brokerage pointed to Nestle India’s strongest volume-led topline growth in nearly three years, with three of four segments delivering strong value growth. While higher brand investments weighed on margins in the short term, Jefferies said elevated A&P spending should support medium-term growth and category expansion.

"Nifty, Sensex may see weak start on Budget session amid poor global cues",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/nifty-sensex-may-see-weak-start-on-budget-session-amid-poor-global-cues-13802095.html,"Domestic benchmarks Nifty 50 and Sensex are likely to open the Union Budget session on weak footing, as poor global cues, persistent FII outflows, and a weak currency dampen sentiment. Markets are likely to remain highly volatile, with sharp moves possible in either direction depending on key announcements around fiscal policy, capex push, sector-specific incentives, and the fiscal deficit target (expected around 4.3–4.4% of GDP for FY27), according to analysts. On Friday, the S&P 500 its decline on Friday, with the benchmark index slipping 0.43 percent, marking its third consecutive losing session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.36 percent, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite underperformed, sliding 0.94 percent. All three major indexes were down more than 1 percent at their intraday lows. Stocks retreated as technology shares stayed under pressure, even as investors broadly welcomed President Donald Trump’s nomination of Kevin Warsh as Federal Reserve chair. A favourable Budget reaction could trigger an upside breakout, while any disappointment or profit-booking may pull indices back towards lower support zones. “Until there is clarity from the Budget, the overall bias remains cautious to neutral,” said Ponmudi R, CEO of Enrich Money. In the previous session, the Nifty declined 0.4 percent to snap a three-day winning streak weighed down by sharp losses in metal and IT stocks. However, between the last Budget and now, benchmark indices delivered modest returns, masking wide dispersion beneath the surface. Midcaps outperformed, but smallcaps slipped marginally, down 0.5 percent, reflecting tighter liquidity and selective risk-taking. India's underperformance becomes more pronounced when viewed against global peers in dollar terms. While the Sensex and Nifty delivered returns of just 0.3 percent and 1.8 percent respectively (in dollar terms), several global indices posted outsized gains. The Nasdaq climbed 20.7 percent, the S&P 500 rose 15.4 percent, and Japan's Nikkei jumped 37 percent. Against this backdrop, investors are looking to the upcoming Budget for clarity on growth support, fiscal discipline and sector-specific triggers that could broaden participation and restore confidence. Whether the next budget can reverse India's relative underperformance and revive risk appetite remains the key question as markets turn the page to a new fiscal year.

"Gold, silver prices crash up to 30% in two days: Hindustan Zinc, MCX, Muthoot Finance, other stocks in focus on Budget Day",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/hindustan-zinc-mcx-muthoot-finance-other-stocks-in-focus-amid-gold-silver-crash-what-to-expect-13802077.html,"The shares of gold financier stocks and silver producer Hindustan Zinc will remain in focus on February 1 amid a sharp crash in gold and silver prices. This comes as investors actively await how markets will react to Union Budget 2026, which is set to be presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman today. Gold and silver prices have seen a significant decline in the second half of last week, after scaling fresh lifetime highs just before. Gold, silver prices crashed on Friday: Gold futures with April expiry on MCX dropped around 9 percent to hit a low of Rs 1,67,406 per 10 grams on Friday. This came a day after the contracts hit a fresh lifetime high of Rs 1,93,096 per 10 grams. This means that the gold futures fell 13 percent (Rs 25,690 per 10 grams) in just one day. Silver futures with March expiry meanwhile dropped nearly 17 percent to Rs 3,32,002 per kilogram on Friday. This marks a fall of nearly 21 percent (Rs 88,046 per kilogram) in just one day after hitting a fresh lifetime high of Rs 4,20,048 per kg. Spot silver on COMEX dropped around 30 percent in two days to close at $85.250 per ounce on Friday. Spot gold meanwhile fell around 13 percent during the same period to close at $4,879.60 per ounce. The sharp fall in global prices of the precious metals on Friday came amid speculations that the US Federal Reserve may get a more hawkish chair. Later during the day, the speculations did come true as US President Donald Trump said ​he had ‍chosen former ⁠Federal ‍Reserve Governor ‌Kevin ‌Warsh to ⁠head ⁠the ​American central bank. As a result, gold and silver exchange traded funds (ETFs) mirrored the sharp fall and plunged as much as 24 percent after a sharp run-up. Stocks affected by crash in gold-silver prices: Muthoot Finance shares plunged 7 percent to close at Rs 3,818 apiece on Friday. The shares of other gold financiers like Manappuram Finance and IIFL Finance meanwhile fell around 4 percent each. The shares of Multi Commodity Exchange of India (MCX) tumbled more than 6 percent to end the session at Rs 2,515 apiece on Friday. Hindustan Zinc, which is the largest producer of silver in India, and produces refined silver with a minimum 99.9 percent purity, saw is shares crash around 12.5 percent to Rs 626 apiece. Vedanta shares dropped more than 11 percent. What lies ahead for gold and silver? Last week’s sharp fall in gold and silver prices can be explained as a classic bout of profit-booking after an extended record rally and not as a breakdown in fundamental sentiments, said Pranav Koomar, Founder and CEO of PlusCash. While high positioning, strong dollar movements, and an uptick in bond yields have contributed to a correction in gold prices, from a medium- to a long-term perspective, the prices have continued to find support due to global uncertainty, buying from Central Banks, and tight supply dynamics, the analyst added. Investors should consider any fall as a buying opportunity and not a sign of any change in the trend, Koomar said. Maneesh Sharma, AVP - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers, noted that the sharp moves in precious metals seen today reflected speculation that Warsh may be less enthusiastic to cut rates than other candidates, given his past warnings of inflation risks and more recent calls for the Fed to reduce its balance sheet. ""Going ahead markets could now look ahead to more cues from labor market reports due next week in US which could show signs of weakening labor markets, while local markets could remain glued towards Union budget announcement due on Sunday. Any signs of changes in Import duty structure could reflect directly into MCX prices. Overall volatility with a corrective bias is expected to persist for few more sessions before markets stabilize at lower levels,"" Sharma added.

Union Budget 2026: Here are the 11 stocks analysts think could steal Budget Day spotlight,https://www.moneycontrol.com/budget/union-budget-2026-here-are-the-11-stocks-analysts-think-could-steal-budget-day-spotlight-article-13802061.html,"Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman is set to announce the Union Budget for the financial year 2026-27. Most experts expect the government to increase capital expenditure on February 1 to boost infrastructure and defence which has remained the pivotal theme for the government, while maintaining fiscal deficit of 4.4 percent of GDP or lowering it to 4.3-4.2 percent for FY27. The Centre is also expected to continue focussing on supporting consumption and increasing industrial output, but unlikely to announce significant changes in personal taxes. Considering the mega economic event, analysts suggest betting on and focus on these 11 stocks today: Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Research – Wealth Management at Motilal Oswal Financial Services NMDC | Target: Rs 98 NMDC stands to benefit from the Budget’s emphasis on manufacturing and supply-chain security through the critical minerals mission, alongside sustained infrastructure capex, which supports long-term demand visibility and reinforces the government’s push toward domestic resource development and import substitution. Going forward, volumes are expected to rise steadily to 51 million tonnes (MT) in FY27 and 54MT in FY28, aided by EC enhancements and stable realizations. NMDC’s ongoing capex toward evacuation and capacity projects is set to lift capacity to 100MT by FY29-30. Click Here To Read All Budget Related News Bharat Electronics | Target: Rs 520 Bharat Electronics is well positioned as the Budget is expected to prioritise defence and allied sectors, with defence capex growth of ~15% over the planned FY26 base. Additionally, with the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) recently approving significant capital acquisition proposals, amplifying orderbook visibility; sustained emphasis on indigenisation and strategic electronics underpins long-term demand alongside supportive macro liquidity. Bharat Electronics continues to remain a key beneficiary of large platform orders across Army, Navy, Airforce as it stands to benefit from large orders like QRSAM, Next generation corvettes, Akash-NG along with the base orders. With improved indigenization levels and operating leverage benefits, we expect strong margin performance of Bharat Electronics to continue. We expect revenue/PAT to grow at 18%/16% CAGR over FY25-28. Larsen & Toubro | Target: Rs 4,600 Larsen & Toubro remains a key Budget beneficiary as capital expenditure is expected to grow ~10% YoY and stay near ~3% of GDP, with continued focus on roads, railways, defence, and urban infrastructure, supporting strong order inflows amid a supportive macro and liquidity environment. L&T aims to add nearly 4-5GW of thermal power projects over the next two years out of the total opportunity of 10-15GW ordering in the sector. It is also eyeing opportunities in nuclear EPC projects. We factor in order inflows to grow at 13% CAGR over FY25-28 for core E&C segment. L&T’s risk-mitigation framework for mega projects and growing international diversification further strengthen execution visibility. We expect core E&C revenue/EBITDA/PAT to grow at a CAGR of 16%/18%/22%. SBI Life Insurance Company | Target: Rs 2,750 SBI Life should remain in focus as insurance sector reforms, including higher FDI limits and distribution architecture changes, align with the government’s financial inclusion agenda, while benign inflation and steady income growth support long-term protection demand; pending regulatory changes toward composite licences to sell health insurance could materially expand its addressable market. Management has retained APE (annual premium equivalent) growth guidance of 13–14% with momentum sustaining into FY27. GST impact is expected to be offset by product mix and efficiency, limiting net impact to ~30–40bp. We expect FY25–28 APE/VNB CAGR at 15%/16%, with operating RoEV above 18%. Devarsh Vakil, Head of Prime Research at HDFC Securities KNR Constructions | Target: Rs 240 KNR Constructions is poised to benefit from higher MoRTH allocations, asset monetization via InvITs, and budgetary focus on irrigation and river-linking projects. With NHAI’s bidding silence ending in November 2025, the January-March 2026 tender cycle could drive Rs 8,000-10,000 crore inflows. Diversification into mining, solar, and urban infra, alongside favorable bidding norms, supports a strong recovery trajectory by FY27. Jupiter Wagons | Target: Rs 355 Jupiter Wagons is set to benefit from a 5-10% YoY rise in railway allocations, supporting India’s “Viksit Bharat” vision. A capex pivot toward rolling stock induction, alongside higher spending on the Dedicated Freight Corridor, logistics infrastructure, multi-modal warehousing, and safety upgrades like Kavach 4.0, positions the company for sustained growth within the expanding rail ecosystem. Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers | Target: Rs 3,110 The Government of India could prioritise Atmanirbharta (self-reliance) in defence by adopting modern techniques, including artificial intelligence and robotics. Maintaining a strong net worth amid moderate capital expenditure (capex), robust order book, and healthy cash accruals should continue to support GRSE over the medium term. Investors can buy the stock with a target price of Rs 3110. At the LTP of Rs 2,764, the stock is trading at 31.3x FY28E EPS.

Market breadth was positive, with about 1,661 shares advancing against 1,238 declining shares on the NSE. The market is expected to remain range-bound with an elevated VIX. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Rajesh Palviya, Senior Vice President Research (Head Technical Derivatives) at Axis Securities Oil India | CMP: 510 On the weekly chart, Oil India has staged a major breakout above the multiple resistance zone around Rs 490, following a period of consolidation. The breakout is reinforced by a sharp surge in trading volumes, signalling strong buying interest. The expansion of the weekly Bollinger Bands indicates that the stock is entering a high-momentum phase, while the weekly RSI (14) is trading above 70, confirming strong upward momentum. Additionally, the RSI has crossed above its horizontal resistance at 60, further validating the breakout and underscoring the bullish bias. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 550, Rs 600 Stop-Loss: Rs 480 Bajaj Auto | CMP: Rs 9,597.5 On the weekly chart, Bajaj Auto is trending within a rising channel, recently finding support at the lower band and now moving toward the upper band. It has also surpassed a key horizontal supply zone in the Rs 9,300–9,400 range, signalling further strength. The stock is comfortably trading above its 20-, 50-, and 200-day SMAs, confirming a robust primary bullish trend. The weekly upward structure, along with the expanding upper Bollinger Band, points to a gradual upside continuation. Additionally, the weekly RSI is trending higher and holding above its reference line, reinforcing a positive bias. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 10,000, Rs 10,250 Stop-Loss: Rs 9,300 Union Bank of India | CMP: Rs 180.76 On the weekly chart, Union Bank of India has staged a decisive breakout above the medium-term horizontal resistance at Rs 173, supported by a notable surge in trading volumes, signalling strong accumulation.

The technical structure has turned positive, with a positive crossover seen in the MACD histogram around the zero line, which has propelled the stock above the cluster of its short- and medium-term EMAs. Additionally, the double-bottom formation adds to the bullish quotient, suggesting continued growth potential in the near term.

However, the recent traction from the support zone and oversold territory portrays an early signal of reversal in the near term. Also, the 14-week RSI and MACD histograms are aligned with the pullback momentum in the stock, suggesting a strong risk–reward ratio. Hence, buying CG Power around Rs 580–570 is recommended. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 640, Rs 670 Stop-Loss: Rs 525 Oil and Natural Gas Corporation | CMP: Rs 269 ONGC has demonstrated a substantial consolidation breakout after an elongated period, propelling the stock above all its significant EMAs and indicating a bullish bias.

The stock has now sustained above the breakout level for three consecutive weeks, confirming acceptance and reducing the risk of a false move. The price structure across timeframes is constructive, with daily, weekly, and monthly moving averages tightly aligned and rising, acting as a strong launchpad on dips. Momentum indicators remain supportive, and volume behaviour suggests steady institutional participation rather than speculative churn. Any retracement back toward the Rs 60 breakout zone offers a favourable risk–reward opportunity to add long positions. As long as this level holds on a closing basis, the stock is well positioned for an upside extension toward the Rs 75 zone in the near to medium term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 75 Stop-Loss: Rs 60 Lupin | CMP: Rs 2,152.8 Lupin is on the verge of resolving a major 50-week rectangle on the weekly chart, with the upper boundary placed near Rs 2,180. The right side of the structure has tightened sharply, with volumes drying up—a classic precursor to an expansion move. This contraction suggests supply exhaustion rather than distribution. Moving averages across timeframes have flattened and are beginning to turn up, while momentum indicators are transitioning from neutral toward a bullish trajectory. Price acceptance near the range high keeps the setup constructive. A clean breakout and sustained move above Rs 2,180 would confirm pattern resolution and is likely to trigger a swift move toward the Rs 2,400 zone. Risk–reward favours the upside at this inflection point, with failure to break out likely leading only to further consolidation rather than an immediate breakdown.

Broader indices outperform; over 100 small-cap stocks surge up to 29%,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/broader-indices-outperform-over-100-small-cap-stocks-surge-up-to-29-13801303.html,"The broader market outperformed the benchmark indices during the week, with the BSE Mid-cap and Small-cap indices gaining between 2–3 percent led by defence, energy, oil & gas stocks. For the week, the BSE Sensex climbed 732.08 points, or 0.89 percent, to close at 82,269.78, while the Nifty50 advanced 272 points, or 1.08 percent, to settle at 25,320.65. However, on a monthly basis, both indices declined 3 percent each. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) turned buyers on Friday, purchasing equities worth Rs 2,251 crore. However, they remained net sellers for the week, having offloaded shares worth Rs 730 crore. Meanwhile, Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) continued their support, buying equities worth Rs 14,398.03 crore. Among sectors, the Nifty Defence index outperformed with a nearly 9 percent gain, followed by Nifty Energy, which rose 6 percent. The Nifty Oil & Gas index added 4 percent, while Nifty Realty and Metal indices climbed 3 percent each. On the other hand, the Nifty IT, FMCG, and Healthcare indices declined by 0.5 percent each. ""Indian equities traded in a volatile yet cautiously constructive tone during the week, shaped by domestic policy expectations and evolving global cues. Initially sentiment was subdued due to renewed tariff-related concerns and mixed corporate earnings, although optimism surrounding the India–EU trade agreement lent support, particularly to trade-oriented sectors. Select pockets of weakness were observed in Autos and Beverages amid intensifying competitive pressures,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments. ""Market sentiment improved mid-week following a favourable economic survey that reinforced expectations of robust FY27 growth and a benign inflation outlook. However, risk appetite weakened toward the end of the week ahead of the Union Budget, with volatility resurfacing amid FII outflows and rupee depreciation. Profit booking intensified in Metals and IT amid a firmer dollar and global liquidity concerns, with sentiment turning cautious ahead of clarity on the incoming Fed Chair. Markets remain wary that a potentially stronger inflation focus could prolong tight financial conditions and weigh on emerging markets."" ""Looking ahead, markets are expected to remain largely event-driven, with the Union Budget acting as the key domestic trigger. Expectations are balanced between growth support and fiscal prudence. Cyclical sectors may continue to show relative resilience if supported by policy measures, while IT and export-oriented stocks are likely to remain sensitive to global macro cues,"" Nair added. ""Overall, markets are expected to stay range-bound, underpinned by strong domestic fundamentals but constrained by external uncertainties, including geopolitical risks, global tariff developments, and the U.S. Fed’s evolving policy outlook,"" he said further. The BSE Small-cap index jumped 3 percent, led by sharp gains in Sharda Cropchem, Hindustan Copper, MIC Electronics, SPEL Semiconductor, Panorama Studios International, JITF Infralogistics, Mahindra Logistics, Moschip Technologies, Walchandnagar Industries, Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers, Manorama Industries, MTAR Technologies, Data Patterns (India), Punjab Chemicals & Crop Protection, Sterlite Technologies, and Taneja Aerospace and Aviation, all of which surged more than 20 percent each. Meanwhile, Vimta Labs, Sri Adhikari Brothers Television, OneSource Specialty Pharma, IFB Industries, South Indian Bank, SBFC Finance, and Best Agrolife declined over 15 percent. Where is market headed? Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical and Derivatives Research at SBI Securities Going ahead, the immediate resistance for Nifty is placed in the 25,450–25,500 zone, with the Index failing to decisively close above this zone after attempting twice in the last six sessions. A decisive breakout above this zone could result in Nifty extending its pullback towards 25,650, followed by 25,800 in the near term. On the downside, the 200-day EMA zone of 25,200–25,150 zone is likely to act as a strong support. Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Our view on the Nifty remains unchanged. Sustenance above the 25,350 level could result in a further rebound towards the 25,600 zone, while a decisive break below the long-term moving average, the 200 DEMA around 25,150, may derail the recovery and drag the index towards the 24,750–24,900 zone. With all eyes on the Union Budget, we expect heightened volatility during the special trading session on Sunday and suggest preferring a hedged approach. Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities Technically, this market action indicates a consolidation movement in Nifty near the crucial resistance. The market is awaiting a fresh direction from the key economic event of Union Budget 2026 which will be presented in the Parliament on Sunday-1st Feb. Hence the outcome of this event could open fresh moves in the marketon on either side. Immediate support is placed at 25200 and a sustainable upmove above 25450-25500 levels could possibly open sharp upside ahead.

"US stocks fall, as investors fret over Trump's Fed nominee, earnings, inflation",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/us-stocks-fall-as-investors-fret-over-trump-s-fed-nominee-earnings-inflation-13801152.html,"Wall Street's main indexes closed lower on Friday as investors viewed President Donald Trump's nomination of former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh as a hawkish choice to succeed Federal Reserve Chair ​Jerome Powell, while also digesting earnings reports and a high inflation reading. On top of assessing the risks from U.S. tensions with countries including Iran, investors were also worried about ‌the prospect of another U.S. government shutdown after new barriers emerged in the Senate to a deal that would ensure continuation of funding for agency operations. At the Fed, Warsh, 55, is expected to favor lower interest rates but stop short of the more aggressive monetary easing linked to some other potential nominees. With Powell's term ending in May, Warsh, if confirmed by the Senate, would take the helm of a central bank he has argued should scale back its role in the economy and rethink its approach to monetary policy. ""Markets are calibrating to Trump's pick of Kevin Warsh ... and the outlook for monetary policy,"" said Michael Hans, chief investment officer at ‌Citizens Wealth, who also pointed to an unwinding of recent trading patterns with the U.S. dollar gaining ground on Friday and precious metals selling off sharply. Meanwhile, ​in earnings, Apple shares regained ground to close up 0.4% after earlier losses a day after the iPhone maker released quarterly results. On the data front, producer prices increased more than expected in December, suggesting inflation could pick up in the months ahead. ""There's a combination of investor concerns around the Fed chair announcement, some mixed tech earnings and lingering inflation pressure as well as some uncertainty about a potential government ‍shutdown even though it should be short-lived,"" said Angelo Kourkafas, senior global strategist at Edward Jones. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 179.09 points, or 0.36%, to 48,892.47, the S&P 500 lost 29.98 points, or 0.43%, to 6,939.03 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 223.30 points, or 0.94%, to 23,461.82. The rate-sensitive, small-cap Russell 2000 index has recently been outperforming large-cap indexes but on Friday it lagged with a 1.6% loss for the day. But the Russell 2000 ended the month up ⁠more than 5%, compared with monthly advances of 1.4% for the S&P 500 and 0.9% for the Nasdaq. The Dow, meanwhile, climbed 1.7% for January, to notch a ninth consecutive monthly advance, its longest ‍winning streak since 2018. For the week, the S&P 500 rose 0.3%, the Dow fell 0.4% and the Nasdaq fell 0.2%. The S&P's Materials index led declines among the S&P 500's 11 major industry sectors, with a 1.9% loss, ‌as U.S.-listed gold ‌and silver miners tumbled in sympathy with the massive selloff in gold prices and in silver. Defensive consumer staples was the sector with the biggest advance on the day, rising 1.4%. Colgate-Palmolive (CL.N), opens new tab was its biggest gainer, closing up 5.9%, after the maker of toothpaste and soap forecast annual sales above Wall Street estimates on steady demand for household staples in markets such as Latin America and Europe. Investors have given a mixed reception to megacap earnings reports this week with a stark warning that record capital‑spending binges will be tolerated as long as the growth keeps coming. Apple wrapped up the week with a forecast of higher-than-expected revenue growth of ⁠up to 16% for the March quarter, but ⁠warned that rising memory-chip prices had started ​to pressure profitability. Microsoft ended down 0.7% on Friday after falling 10% on Thursday for its deepest daily loss since March 2020 after its cloud revenue failed to impress. Meta shares closed 3% lower on Friday. After falling on Thursday following its results, Tesla shares rose 3.3% on Friday, providing the S&P 500 with its biggest boost, after reports that SpaceX is exploring deals with the electric-vehicle maker and other companies run by Elon Musk. Verizon Communications was the ‍S&P 500's second-biggest boost, finishing up 11.8% after it forecast annual profit and free cash flow above market expectations on Friday, after aggressive promotions during the peak holiday period fueled its highest quarterly wireless subscriber additions in six years. SanDisk shares rallied 6.9% after a better-than-expected third-quarter forecast as AI fuels storage demand. But KLA Corp shares tumbled 15.2% even after the company beat Wall Street expectations for second-quarter profit and revenue. Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 1.59-to-1 ratio on the NYSE ​where there were 247 new highs and 154 new lows. On the Nasdaq, 1,599 stocks rose and 3,222 fell as ‍declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2.02-to-1 ratio. The S&P 500 posted 19 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 72 new highs and 205 new lows.

Click to View More Outlook for February 1 Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities The Indian market posted weekly gains, led by recovery across market cap. The BSE midcap and the small cap indices outperformed the larger peers. BSE Metals (commodity rally), capital goods (budget expectation) and Oil & Gas (rise in oil price) were the major gainers in this week, whereas BSE Auto index (reacted to India EU FTA) witnessed correction. The INR (vs USD) that has been weakening in recent weeks, hit fresh record lows this week. Oil prices have been climbing sharply in this week — with Brent crude and WTI hitting multi-month highs on rising geopolitical risk. From India’s perspective, sharp increase in oil prices can fuel inflation, put pressure on currency and widen the current account deficit. The Indian market witnessed a decent Q3FY26 earnings season, with aggregate earnings marginally ahead of expectations until now. FII continues to sell Indian equities with net selling in cash market in Jan 2026 (till date) crossing Rs 40,000 crore. Global equity markets priced in weakening of the Dollar index, the US Fed keeping policy rates unchanged, increased geopolitical tensions, and a sharp increase in gold and silver prices. In the coming week, Union Budget, commodity price movement, geo-political developments, currency movements, Q3FY26 results & management commentary and FII activity will influence the Indian equity market. Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical and Derivatives Research at SBI Securities Nifty opened on a weak note and spent most of the session in a narrow, sideways range. The index found strong intraday support twice in the 25220–25210 zone and staged a smart recovery towards the last hour. However, it closed the day at 25,321, down 0.39% for the day. After bouncing off its 200-day EMA in the previous session, Nifty failed to see meaningful follow-through and ended the day trading inside the prior day’s range. Going ahead, the immediate resistance for Nifty is placed in the 25,450–25,500 zone, with the Index failing to decisively close above this zone after attempting twice in the last six sessions. A decisive breakout above this zone could result in Nifty extending its pullback towards 25,650, followed by 25,800 in the near term. On the downside, the 200-day EMA zone of 25,200–25,150 zone is likely to act as a strong support.

The Nifty India Defence Index rose over 1.5 percent to an intraday high of 8,193.50. The index is up 8.9 percent so far this week, marking its strongest weekly rise since May 2025, when India-Pakistan border tensions had flared. The rally comes ahead of the Union Budget, with analysts expecting a substantial increase in defence capital spending. Om Ghawalkar, Market Analyst, Share.Market (PhonePe Wealth), noted ""the Nifty India Defence Index is flashing strong bullish signals as it prepares for a major breakout from a Double Bottom pattern. Currently trading at 8,184, the index has gained 8% this week, significantly outperforming the broader market. This momentum is supported by a Golden Crossover, where the 10-day and 21-day moving averages have climbed above the medium-term trend, confirming a new uptrend. With a rising MACD and prices holding well above all key moving averages, the technical setup suggests that buyers are firmly in control."" ""The index's strength is further highlighted by its position relative to long-term trend lines. It is currently trading comfortably above its 50-day SMA and its 200-day SMA, which indicates a robust primary trend. The recent ""Golden Crossover"" specifically saw the short-term averages move past the 100-day SMA, providing a clear technical ""buy"" signal for momentum traders looking at the medium-term horizon. Looking ahead, the index faces immediate hurdles at 8,350 and 8,450. A clean break above these resistance levels could trigger a fresh rally toward previous record highs. On the downside, the 7,300–7,400 zone provides a solid support floor, protecting against sudden volatility. As the Union Budget 2026 approaches on February 1, this pre-budget momentum highlights the sector's strength and its role as a key growth theme for investors in the current market. Hemant Sood, Managing Director, Findoc, said ""The sharp rally in defence stocks reflects strong investor expectations of a higher defence allocation in the upcoming Union Budget, driven largely by evolving global geopolitical tensions and rising security concerns. With ongoing international conflicts, markets are factoring in increased focus on defence preparedness and modernization."" ""Within the sector, aerial combat technologies and drone manufacturing are likely to remain key beneficiaries, as next-generation warfare increasingly relies on surveillance, automation, and advanced combat systems. Additionally, defence PSU stocks are expected to stay in focus, given their direct linkage to government spending and execution. From a valuation standpoint, defence stocks are not excessively stretched, which further supports the ongoing momentum. Overall, a favourable budgetary push, combined with strategic importance and reasonable valuations, is driving sustained investor interest in the defence space,"" he added. According to Emkay Research, recent geopolitical developments leave the government with limited flexibility, necessitating higher defence outlays. The brokerage has forecast a 12–13 percent year-on-year growth in defence spending over the next three to four years. Nuvama Institutional Equities also expects the Budget to accelerate spending in the sector. Macquarie said India could raise defence expenditure to 2.5 percent of GDP by fiscal 2027 from 1.9 percent in the current fiscal, with a sharper focus on indigenisation. The defence index has gained 5.15 percent so far in January, compared with a 3.3 percent decline in the benchmark Nifty 50. The Nifty India Defence Index had fallen 1.2 percent in the previous session but recovered those losses on Friday. All its 18 constituents were trading in the green. Dynamatic Technologies emerged as the top gainer, rising 8 percent to Rs 8,790 per share. Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers and MTAR Technologies followed, advancing 7.37 percent and 7.19 percent, respectively. MTAR Technologies reported a strong performance in the December quarter, supported by healthy execution across segments and operating leverage. The company’s net profit more than doubled to Rs 34.6 crore in the third quarter of FY26 from Rs 15.9 crore a year ago, while revenue rose 56.9 percent year-on-year to Rs 273.7 crore. EBITDA jumped 80.7 percent to Rs 59.8 crore, with operating margin improving to 22 percent from 19 percent in the corresponding quarter last year. ""GRSE is mirroring the Nifty Defence Index’s bullish structure, currently trading at ₹2,764. Technically, the stock is primed for an uptrend as it forms a Double Bottom pattern with strong volume accumulation. While ₹2,100 serves as a solid support floor, the stock faces its next major test at the ₹3,000 psychological resistance level. MTAR Technologies is witnessing a powerful technical breakout, surging past the critical Rs 2,700 resistance to reach Rs 2,931. This move is validated by a massive volume spike and a bullish MACD crossover, signaling that the stock has shifted from consolidation to an aggressive growth phase. Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders is showing early signs of a bullish reversal as it successfully closed above its 50-day moving average this week,"" added Ghawalkar. Shares of Paras Defence and Space Technologies, Cochin Shipyard, Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders, Bharat Electronics and Hindustan Aeronautics also gained up to 3 percent.

"Government sets minimum import price for penicillin, salts; Aurobindo Pharma stock up",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/government-sets-minimum-import-price-for-penicillin-salts-aurobindo-pharma-stock-up-13799687.html,"The Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) has set a minimum import price (MIP) for penicillin and its salts, which are critical antibiotic raw material, for a year to curb dumping, especially from China. MIP is a government-mandated, temporary floor price below which specific foreign goods cannot be imported, designed to protect domestic industries from cheap, predatory or dumped imports. Through MIP, the government wants to protect the fledgling domestic fermentation industry from a surge of low-cost Chinese imports for critical antibiotic raw materials. The move is a major win for Aurobindo Pharma, providing the necessary pricing floor to make its Rs 3,500-crore (approximately $420 million) investment under the government’s Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme viable. At 1.18 pm, the Aurobindo Pharma share was trading at Rs 1187.10 on the National Stock Exchange, up 3.17 percent from the previous close. Aurobindo, which has built a massive facility to manufacture penicillin, 6-APA, and amoxicillin trihydrate, the policy provides a critical shield against international price undercutting that had threatened to stall its operations. Price protection shield Penicillin-G (Pen-G) will be have MIP of Rs 2,216 a kg (approximately $26.50 per kg); 6-APA Rs.3, 405 (around $40.80) and amoxicillin trihydrate Rs 2,733 a kg ($32.70), the government said in a notification on January 29. International price for Pen-G had fallen to $13.5 a kg by late 2025, far below the $25 level analysts estimate is required for domestic production to remain profitable, forcing the government to step in. Domestic players were being forced to calibrate production to minimal levels despite having the capacity to meet national demand. Countering predatory imports For decades, India has been almost entirely dependent on China for fermentation-based inputs, leaving its primary healthcare system vulnerable to supply chain shocks. MIP is designed to neutralise predatory pricing rather than act as a permanent trade barrier. The restrictions do not apply to export-oriented units (EOUs) or imports used for re-export under the Advance Authorisation scheme. Expanding the playbook: Clavulanic Acid The Pen-G decision follows a similar protective measure for potassium clavulanate (KGA), a critical component in widely used combination antibiotics. The government set an MIP of $180 a kg, effective until November 2026, to support Kinvan Pvt Ltd., the first Indian firm to produce the ingredient domestically. Kinvan, which plans to scale up to 300 metric tons annually, saw prices crash from $195 to $150 shortly after its project was launched, a volatility the MIP is intended to curb. While some import-reliant firms have raised concerns about potential cost increases, government officials said most penicillin-based medicines are already under price control, meaning any incremental cost impact at the consumer level should remain marginal.","MIP is a government-mandated, temporary floor price below which specific foreign goods cannot be imported, designed to protect domestic industries from cheap, predatory or dumped imports.","Price protection shield Penicillin-G (Pen-G) will be have MIP of Rs 2,216 a kg (approximately $26.50 per kg); 6-APA Rs.3, 405 (around $40.80) and amoxicillin trihydrate Rs 2,733 a kg ($32.70), the government said in a notification on January 29. International price for Pen-G had fallen to $13.5 a kg by late 2025, far below the $25 level analysts estimate is required for domestic production to remain profitable, forcing the government to step in.","MIP is a government-mandated, temporary floor price below which specific foreign goods cannot be imported, designed to protect domestic industries from cheap, predatory or dumped imports.","Price protection shield Penicillin-G (Pen-G) will be have MIP of Rs 2,216 a kg (approximately $26.50 per kg); 6-APA Rs.3, 405 (around $40.80) and amoxicillin trihydrate Rs 2,733 a kg ($32.70), the government said in a notification on January 29.

The shares of the CV-maker plunged to Rs 450.55 apiece on Friday, snapping a two-session gaining streak. Tata Motors Q3 Results: Tata Motors on January 29 reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 705 crore for the third quarter of the financial year 2026. This marks a 48 percent year-on-year (YoY) fall from the Rs 1,355 crore net profit reported in the same period last year. The earnings however were impacted by some exceptional losses. The firm incurred a one-time cost of Rs 962 crore to account for the stamp duty charges payable to various local authorities to effect transfer of registration of land acquired as part of the its demerger scheme. Additionally, the company also incurred a one-time cost of Rs 603 crore due to the implementation of the new labour codes, which took effect last year, along with Rs 82 crore for acquisition. Overall, the company incurred exceptional costs worth Rs 1,643 crore during the quarter. The CV-maker’s revenue from operations meanwhile rose more than 16 percent YoY to Rs 21,847 crore during the quarter under review. Operating margin improved to 12.60 percent in Q3 FY26 from 12.07 percent in Q3 FY25, while profit margin reduced to 3.23 percent. Tata Motors reported a 30 bps increase in consolidated EBITDA to 12.5 percent during the October-December quarter of the ongoing FY26. Motilal Oswal on Tata Motors: Motilal Oswal said that the firm’s Q3 results missed estimates, led by input cost pressures. The automaker’s Q3 profit was below the domestic brokerage’s expectations due to lower-than-expected margin at 12.8 percent. “The key concern for TMCV has been its gradual loss of market share across key segments. Further, its recent acquisition of Iveco would expose it to the ongoing global macro uncertainties, thereby driving a potential de-rating, if demand does not improve anytime soon. We have already factored in a pickup in domestic CV demand in our estimates (we estimate 9% volume CAGR over FY25-28E). We also factor in margins to remain stable at 13% over FY25-28E,” Motilal said. However, the brokerage added that the stock appears to be fairly valued now after a recent rally. It remained ‘Neutral’ on the stock, with a target price of Rs 431 apiece, which implies an upside potential of more than 8 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. Emkay Global on Tata Motors: Emkay Global said that the firm’s net profit beat its estimate mainly on account of lower-than-expected tax expense. “We believe the overall CV demand environment remains constructive, with double-digit growth likely to sustain till H1FY27 – TMCV should lead this multi-year upcycle in our view,” it said. The firm retained its ‘Buy’ call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 650 apiece, which implies an upside potential of more than 38 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. JM Financial on Tata Motors: JM Financial said that rising commodity prices are expected to have impact on margins in Q4 FY26. “To partly offset this, the company has implemented a 1% price hike effective 1st Jan’26, while a potential moderation in discount intensity could provide additional support to the margins,” it said. The brokerage kept a ‘Buy’ call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 550 apiece. This implies an upside potential of nearly 17 percent from the stock’s previous closing price.

Shares of Manappuram Finance slipped over 9 percent to an intraday low of Rs 270 per share on the NSE. The company had reported a 14.5 percent year-on-year decline in consolidated net profit at Rs 241 crore for the December quarter, impacted by a slowdown in its microfinance segment. Global brokerage Jefferies, which has a ‘Hold’ rating on the stock with a price target of Rs 285, said lower net interest margins and higher provisions led to the earnings miss, even as gold loan growth remained strong and management undertook measures to strengthen the franchise. PhillipCapital upgraded Manappuram Finance to ‘Neutral’ from ‘Sell’ with a price target of Rs 260, citing improving gold loan momentum and management-led restructuring. The brokerage noted that higher costs and stress in the microfinance business weighed on quarterly profit. The stock has gained around 64 percent so far in 2025, while it is down about 3.8 percent in January. Meanwhile, shares of Muthoot Finance fell over 7 percent to Rs 3,924 on the NSE.

On the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), gold futures for the February contract declined Rs 2,162, or 1.28 percent, to Rs 1,67,241 per 10 grams. In the previous session, gold had surged nearly 9 percent to hit a record high of Rs 1,80,779 per 10 grams before easing. ""After hitting record highs, gold and silver prices dropped as a rebound in the US dollar triggered aggressive profit-taking,"" said Manav Modi, Commodities Analyst at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. He said domestic prices declined more than international benchmarks in the previous session, raising price parity concerns. The dollar index rebounded from recent lows of 96, while the USD/INR pair touched a record high. According to Modi, elevated prices had already dampened physical demand. He added that the World Gold Council noted a moderation in central bank purchases in the fourth quarter of 2025, although strong investor inflows offset the slowdown. The council has also indicated that India’s gold imports may decline this year as record prices weigh on jewellery demand.

Brokerages have mixed views for the stock. The shares of the fintech platform dropped to Rs 1,115.60 apiece, the lowest level seen by the stock since September 30. Paytm Q3 Results: Paytm on January 29 reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 225 crore for Q3 FY26, as against a net loss of Rs 208 crore for Q3 FY25. The firm’s revenue from operations meanwhile grew more than 20 percent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs 2,194 crore during the quarter under review, as against Rs 1,828 crore in the year-ago period, led by higher payments GMV, merchant subscriptions, and distribution of financial services revenue. EBITDA grew to Rs 156 crore, with EBITDA margin at 7 percent, despite higher promotional expenses for consumer growth and full impact of new labour code, the company said. It reported consistent gain in UPI consumer market share for 3 consecutive quarters, with Paytm’s consumer UPI GMV rising 35 percent in last nine months, as against industry GMV growth of 16 percent during the same period. Brokerages on Paytm: Citi maintained its 'Buy' rating on the stock, but cut its target price to Rs 1,375 apiece from 1,500 apiece. The latest target price implies an upside potential of nearly 18 percent from the stock’s previous closing price of Rs 1,168.1 apiece.

Th stock had earlier seen a sharp decline amid concerns around Payment Infrastructure Development Fund (PIDF) that was extended until December 2025. The initiative by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) aimed to encourage deployment of digital payments acceptance infrastructure like soundboxes and POS devices, through incentives. Notably there has been no update yet as to whether the scheme will be extended beyond 2025. After the shares saw strong volatility following the reports, Paytm issued a clarification. It said that it received Rs 128 crore as incentive under the scheme for the six months ended September 30, 2025. ""In the scenario that the current Scheme is not extended or replaced, we expect to significantly offset the impact over time through a combination of higher revenues and more targeted sales efforts,"" it added. CLSA kept an 'Underperform' call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 1,000 apiece. This marks a 14 percent downside potential from the stock’s previous closing price of Rs 1,168.1 apiece. The international brokerage said that the firm’s Q3 results were in line with estimates. However, it cut profit before tax estimates by 3-5 percent due to loss of PIDF income, which was partly offset by lower ad spend. Jefferies kept a 'Buy' call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 1,450 per share. This implies an upside potential of more than 24 percent over the stock’s previous closing price.

"Swiggy falls 6% as Instamart reports wider sequential losses in Q3, CLSA downgrades stock",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/swiggy-falls-6-as-instamart-reports-wider-sequential-losses-in-q3-clsa-downgrades-stock-13799229.html,"Swiggy shares fell nearly 8 percent on Friday after its quick commerce arm Instamart reported wider sequential losses in the December quarter, while global brokerage CLSA downgraded the stock. Shares of Swiggy declined 7.78 percent to an intraday low of Rs 302.15 apiece on the NSE. The stock opened gap-down, slipping 5.69 percent in early trade, and extended losses thereafter. The decline came after three consecutive sessions of gains. Brokerage reactions to the quarterly performance were mixed. CLSA downgraded Swiggy to ‘Hold’ and cut its price target to Rs 335 after the company missed its revenue and Ebitda estimates for the third quarter. The brokerage said that while the food delivery business reported better growth in gross order value and revenues, with Ebitda broadly in line, the quick commerce segment disappointed across key metrics, reflecting slower growth and weaker profitability. Swiggy Q3 FY26: Strong growth, profitability still a challenge CLSA added that although the company has maintained its guidance for contribution breakeven, the path to achieving it now appears steeper. Ebitda losses at Instamart, the company’s quick commerce unit and its largest revenue generator, widened sequentially during the quarter, even as contribution and Ebitda margins showed some improvement. At the consolidated level, Swiggy reported a narrower sequential loss and reaffirmed its outlook for contribution margin breakeven by the first quarter of FY27. Jefferies said there remain several unanswered questions around the profitability trajectory of the quick commerce business and raised its estimates for Instamart’s losses going forward. Elara Capital described the third-quarter performance as a “mixed bag” but said it expects a sharper focus on profitability in the quick commerce segment, as management reiterated its contribution margin breakeven guidance. The stock is down 20.5 percent so far this year.

"Vedanta shares snap 6-day gains, fall 8% despite strong Q3 results on global decline in metal prices",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/vedanta-shares-snap-6-day-gains-fall-6-despite-strong-q3-results-on-global-decline-in-metal-prices-13799308.html,"The shares of metals-to-oil conglomerate Vedanta dropped more than 8 percent on January 30 after the company released its results for the third quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026. Brokerages have mixed views for the stock. The shares of the company dropped to Rs 702.4 apiece in the morning trading hours of Friday to snap a six-session gaining streak. This comes a day after the stock hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs 769.80 apiece. Notably, today’s sharp fall in Vedanta’s share price also comes amid a broader downturn in metal stocks, buoyed by profit booking, falling metal prices and speculation of a hawkish Federal Reserve Governor. The Nifty Metal index tumbled nearly 5 percent today. Vedanta Q3 Results: Vedanta on January 29 reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 5,710 crore for the October-December quarter of FY26, marking a 61 percent year-on-year (YoY) jump from the Rs 3,547 crore net profit reported in the same period of the previous financial year. The firm’s revenue from operations meanwhile rose 37 percent YoY to Rs 23,369 crore during the quarter under review. “Q3 FY26 has been a landmark quarter for Vedanta, delivering our highest-ever EBITDA of ₹15,171 crore, with two of our businesses achieving their best-ever financial results. Aluminium posted its strongest EBITDA margin of $1,268 per ton, supported by record alumina and aluminium production. Zinc India recorded its highest-ever quarterly EBITDA of ₹6,064 crore, driven by record mined and refined metal output, with silver contributing 44% of overall profit. Zinc International also reported a 28% YoY increase in production, led by Gamsberg achieving its highest-ever recovery,” said Arun Misra, Executive Director, Vedanta. “Our Oil & Gas business reached a major milestone with India’s first subsea template installation, while our Thermal Power Business delivered 188% YoY EBITDA growth with a 62% increase in sales volumes. Steel and Ferrochrome Business also achieved record production of steel billets at 285 kt, and ferrochrome output up 32% YoY,” he added. Brokerages on Vedanta: ICICI Direct Research said that Vedanta’s overall performance for the quarter was aided by higher aluminium, zinc and silver prices, but any cool-off in non-ferrous metal prices and silver could potentially led to stock price decline. Motilal Oswal Financial Services kept a ‘Neutral’ rating on the shares of Vedanta, with a target price of Rs 810 apiece. This implies an upside potential of nearly 6 percent from the stock’s previous closing price of Rs 766.35 apiece. The domestic brokerage said that Vedanta’s Q3 operational performance came largely as expected, supported by better volumes and favorable LME prices. “Capex plans are progressing well and will likely lead to further cost savings. Management targets to maintain strong growth in earnings, led by the upcoming capacity, which will produce higher VAP products. VEDL remains firm on its deleveraging plans, and going forward, higher cash flows will support both its expansion plans and deleveraging efforts,” it added. The stock currently trades at 7x EV/EBITDA and 4.4x P/BV on the FY27 estimate, Motilal said. Emkay Global kept a ‘Buy’ call on the stock, and increased its target price over 21 percent to Rs 850 apiece. The domestic brokerage said that the firm’s strong Q3 results were driven by higher aluminium and zinc profitability. “We continue to believe that if there was ever a better time in the past decade to own exposure to industrial metals, it is now,” it added.

This comes amid profit booking after a sharp gaining streak, and decline in commodity prices. The Nifty Metal index tumbled 5.21 percent to 11,827.55 on Friday, snapping a three-day gaining streak during which it gained nearly 9 percent. The sectoral index closed as the top loser on the market today. Why are metal stocks falling today? The fall in metal stocks may have been partially driven by profit booking after the rally. Additionally, metal prices significantly declined today. Gold and silver futures crashed up to 15 percent on the MCX, while copper and aluminium futures fell around 5 and 7 percent respectively. The sharp fall in global metal prices comes amid speculations that the US Federal Reserve may get a more hawkish chair. US President Donald Trump said he intends to announce his pick to replace Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Friday, as speculation intensifies over who will lead the American central bank after Jerome Powell steps aside in May. ""So, a potentially less dovish Fed Chairman pick, a rebound in the dollar and gold giving way to overbought conditions have contributed to the decline in the price of the precious metal,"" Reuters quoted KCM Chief Trade Analyst Tim Waterer as saying. Top metal losers today: Hindustan Zinc shares were the top loser on the index, falling around 12.5 percent to close at Rs 626 apiece. Vedanta and Hindustan Copper shares fell around 11 percent each. Notably, this comes a day after Hindustan Copper shares jumped 20 percent to hit a fresh lifetime high of Rs 760.05 apiece. Vedanta released its results for the October-December quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026. The company reported a 60 percent year-on-year (YoY) jump in net profit to Rs 7,807 crore on strong base metal prices. Its net profit was Rs 4,876 crore in the year-ago period.

"Gold, silver ETFs crash up to 24% as precious metals tumble further from record highs: Should you buy?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/gold-silver-etfs-crash-up-to-14-as-precious-metals-tumble-from-record-highs-should-you-buy-13799082.html,"Gold and silver exchange traded funds (ETFs) crashed in trade on January 30, as the prices of the precious metals plunged after a record rally. Gold futures with April expiry on MCX dropped around 9 percent to trade at Rs 1,68,000 per 10 grams. This comes a day after the contracts hit a fresh lifetime high of Rs 1,93,096 per 10 grams. The contracts with February and June expiries fell around 9 percent each in the afternoon trading hours of Friday. Silver futures with March expiry meanwhile dropped 15 percent to Rs 3,39,910 per kilogram. The contracts with May and July expiries also fell 15 percent and 12 percent respectively. Gold and silver ETFs crash: Nippon India ETF Gold BeES, which has delivered a return of 104 percent over the past one year, dropped around 10 percent. ICICI Prudential Gold ETF also plunged nearly 10 percent, while Axis Gold ETF fell around 12 percent. UTI Gold ETF, Edelweiss Gold, ETF, HDFC Gold ETF, Quantum Gold ETF, DSP Gold ETF and others also significantly dropped in trade. Among the silver ETFs, Axis Silver ETF crashed 24 percent, while ICICI Prudential Silver and Kotak Silver ETF fell nearly 23 percent. SBI Silver ETF and others fell more than 22 percent each. Mirae Asset Silver ETF, Motilal Oswal Silver ETF, HDFC Silver ETF and Nippon India Silver ETF also plunged sharply. Why are gold and silver prices crashing today? The sharp fall in global prices of the precious metals comes amid speculations that the US Federal Reserve may get a more hawkish chair. Spot gold fell 5 percent on Friday, a day after hitting a record high of $5,594.82. US President Donald Trump said he intends to announce his pick to replace Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Friday, as speculation intensifies over who will lead the American central bank after Jerome Powell steps aside in May. ""So, a potentially less dovish Fed Chairman pick, a rebound in the dollar and gold giving way to overbought conditions have contributed to the decline in the price of the precious metal,"" Reuters quoted KCM Chief Trade Analyst Tim Waterer as saying. ""Rumours that Kevin Warsh will replace Jerome Powell as Fed Chair has weighed on gold during Asian trade,"" said Matt Simpson, a senior analyst at StoneX, as quoted by the report. What should you do? The market is divided between those viewing corrections as buying opportunities and those warning of overheated conditions, said Tanvi Kanchan, Associate Director at Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers. She however added that despite price swings, fundamentals are compelling, driven by near-record industrial demand from solar panels, electric vehicles, and AI infrastructure. Kanchan however cautioned that after such explosive gains in 2025, timing a single entry point is “treacherous”. “Rather than deploying capital all at once, investors should consider spreading purchases over the coming weeks or months. This approach captures the dip while protecting against further corrections that could see silver test,” she said. For conservative investors, allocating 5-10 percent of portfolios to precious metals ETFs through systematic purchases reduces timing risk while maintaining exposure to an asset class that benefits from geopolitical instability and monetary policy uncertainty, according to the expert. With structural drivers such as central-bank accumulation, long-term demand and inflation hedging undiminished, disciplined investors may see this correction as a strategic accumulation zone, but should avoid aggressive short-term speculation given ongoing volatility, Khoo from VT Market said. Nirpendra Yadav, Senior Commodity Research Analyst at Bonanza, said that with global uncertainties, central bank gold accumulation, and expectations of softer real interest rates over the medium term, gold continues to play an important portfolio-hedging and diversification role.

Indian benchmark indices staged a smart rebound from intraday lows on January 29 to end with marginal gains in a volatile session, after the Economic Survey projected GDP growth of 6.8–7.2% for FY27, compared with an estimated 7.4% expansion in the current fiscal. At close, the Sensex was up 221.69 points or 0.27 percent at 82,566.37, and the Nifty was up 76.15 points or 0.30 percent at 25,418.90. GIFT Nifty (Down) The GIFT Nifty is trading lower at around 25,453, indicating a negative opening for the day. Asian Equities (Gain) Stocks were volatile in early Asian trading on Friday after U.S. President Donald Trump endorsed a bipartisan deal to avert a fresh government shutdown and said he has decided who he will nominate to lead the Federal Reserve. US Equities (Mixed) The S&P 500 and the technology-heavy Nasdaq closed lower on Thursday ​as investors were rattled by the latest earnings reports and worried about whether hefty spending on artificial intelligence would pay off for mega‑cap tech companies. The Dow Jones Industrial Average managed to eke out a tiny gain late in the session, rising 55.96 points, ‍or 0.11%, to 49,071.56.

Asian Currencies (Slip) Asian currencies were trading lower in the early trade on Friday with Thai Baht leading the losers followed by Japanese Yen, Malaysian Ringgit, Singapore Dollar. Crude (Down) Oil prices are headed for their biggest monthly gains in years on Friday as tensions in the Middle East escalated over a possible U.S. attack on Iran that could disrupt supplies from one of the biggest OPEC producers.

About 1,717 shares declined against 1,205 advancing shares on the NSE. The market may see range-bound trading ahead of the Union Budget scheduled on February 1. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Jay Mehta, Technical Research at JM Financial Services NTPC | CMP: Rs 358.15 NTPC consolidated in a long-term wedge since April 2025. After breaking above the wedge, it traded sideways in a rectangular range. The latest session delivered a strong breakout above this range on robust positive volume, confirming buyer conviction. The price now trades above all key EMAs with upward slopes. The RSI holds support at 50 on both daily and weekly charts, supporting continued bullish momentum. The structure remains firmly bullish while support holds. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 375 Stop-Loss: Rs 335 Ipca Laboratories | CMP: Rs 1,479.7 Ipca Laboratories broke out from a prolonged triangular consolidation (from January 2–9, 2026), gaining 13.6 percent while broader indices fell around 2.5 percent, showing clear relative strength. The breakout was backed by strong volume. The stock is now retesting the breakout zone and formed a dragonfly doji on January 21, signalling throwback exhaustion. Support has been defended for the third time. Momentum indicators remain bullish and rising. The price is trading above short-, medium-, and long-term EMAs. Repeated support defence and relative strength point to a high-probability reversal. Adding more above Rs 1,525 could propel the bullish move. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,575, Rs 1,680 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,380 NMDC | CMP: Rs 84.6 NMDC broke out above a bullish inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on December 23 from Rs 78.6, rallying to Rs 86.72 before correcting. The pullback found support at the 100-day EMA and successfully retested the breakout zone. The latest bounce formed a strong three white soldiers pattern with rising positive volume, confirming accumulation. The price trades above all key EMAs with upward slopes. Momentum indicators align bullishly, and the structure favours buyers as long as the 100-day EMA holds. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 92, Rs 98 Stop-Loss: Rs 79 Om Mehra, Technical Research Analyst at Samco Securities Mishra Dhatu Nigam | CMP: Rs 387.5 Mishra Dhatu Nigam has shown a sharp pickup in momentum and is now attempting to break above a long-standing downward trendline on the daily chart. The stock has moved decisively higher and is trading above its short-term moving average, indicating improving strength. Volumes have remained stable alongside the rise in price. The daily RSI is placed near 66, highlighting strengthening momentum. The DMI setup shows the positive directional line above the negative line, while the ADX remains elevated, confirming improving trend strength. As long as the stock sustains above the Rs 360 zone, the near-term outlook remains positive. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 415 Stop-Loss: Rs 370 Bharat Petroleum Corporation | CMP: Rs 366.95 BPCL has bounced back from a triple bottom pattern after a corrective phase. The stock is now holding above the previous resistance zone and is attempting to move higher from the Rs 360–365 area. It is trading above its short- and medium-term moving averages and has reclaimed the mid-Bollinger band. The daily RSI is placed near the 55 level. The rate of change indicator remains in positive territory, supporting the ongoing recovery attempt. As long as BPCL holds above the Rs 355 support area, the near-term outlook remains steady. The stock is also respecting the rising VWAP (volume-weighted average price). Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 395 Stop-Loss: Rs 352 BSE | CMP: Rs 2,861.6 BSE has maintained its post-September recovery and is currently trading within a well-defined range on the daily chart. After a sharp advance from the September lows, the stock has spent the last several weeks consolidating between the Rs 2,650 and Rs 2,950 zones, with prices now positioned in the upper half of this range. The stock continues to trade above its 20-day average near Rs 2,750, indicating that short-term support remains intact. The daily RSI is placed near 60, reflecting steady momentum. The DMI setup shows the positive directional line above the negative line, while the ADX remains low. As long as the stock holds above Rs 2,750, the broader setup remains stable, with a directional move likely only on a decisive range breakout. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,080 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,770 Hitesh Tailor, Technical Research Analyst at Choice Broking Larsen & Toubro | CMP: Rs 3,932.9 Larsen & Toubro continues to exhibit a strong bullish structure in the longer-term trend.

Post-breakout, the price retraced toward the 50-week EMA, where it found strong support and resumed its upward move, indicating healthy pullback buying and trend validation. The stock is trading comfortably above its 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-week EMAs, reinforcing the presence of a robust primary uptrend and positive medium-to-long-term sentiment. On the downside, Rs 3,800 acts as an important support zone, where accumulation activity is visible. The latest weekly candle has engulfed the previous range, reflecting renewed bullish dominance and improving momentum. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 4,270 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,730 Indus Towers | CMP: Rs 441.55 Indus Towers has recently delivered a decisive breakout from its prolonged sideways range, signalling the beginning of a fresh bullish phase.

The stock is trading above its key 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-day EMAs, confirming a well-established uptrend and reinforcing positive short-to-medium-term sentiment. From the recent bottom, Indus Towers is forming a higher high and higher low structure, reflecting sustained demand and trend continuation. On the downside, Rs 425 remains an important support area, where accumulation activity is clearly visible. Momentum also supports the bullish view, with the RSI placed at 61.89, holding above the midline and turning higher, suggesting strengthening upside momentum.

On the weekly chart, the stock is trading comfortably above its key 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-week EMAs, confirming a well-established primary uptrend and strengthening medium-to-long-term sentiment. On the downside, the Rs 1,320–1,340 zone emerges as an important support area, aligned with the earlier higher-high breakout region, indicating a classic role reversal from resistance to support and providing a favourable risk-reward setup. Momentum indicators further support the bullish outlook, with the RSI placed at 69.36, reflecting a strong rising trend and sustained upside momentum without immediate signs of exhaustion.

After a weak start, the market traded in a negative zone for the first half, while buying in the second half helped to regain in the losses to end near day's high. At close, the Sensex was up 221.69 points or 0.27 percent at 82,566.37, and the Nifty was up 76.15 points or 0.30 percent at 25,418.90. Among broader indices, Nifty midcap and smallcap indices ended with marginal gains. Also Read: Banks at a crossroads: Rally or selloff on Budget Day?

Click to View More Outlook for January 30 Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets remained volatile but managed to edge higher amid mixed cues. After an initial downtick, the Nifty drifted lower in early trade; however, buying interest in heavyweight stocks across sectors helped pare losses and eventually pushed the index into positive territory. As a result, the benchmark settled near the 25,418 level, up by 0.30 percent. Sectoral trends were mixed, keeping participants engaged, with metals, energy and banking stocks edging higher, while FMCG, pharma and IT names remained under pressure. The broader market took a breather after two sessions of rebound and ended largely unchanged. Market sentiment stayed cautious as investors awaited key domestic events, including the Economic Survey and the upcoming Union Budget. Global uncertainty, mixed corporate earnings and continued foreign institutional selling weighed on risk appetite, while weakness in the Indian rupee added to the cautious undertone. That said, resilience in select heavyweight stocks helped limit the downside and enabled the index to sustain its recovery. The Nifty continues to hover around the long-term moving average, the 200 DEMA, with the ongoing tussle reflecting indecision at these levels. Having crossed the immediate hurdle around 25,350, the index now appears poised to inch towards the 25,600 zone. Strength in the banking index is playing a key role in the rebound, with other sectors providing support on a rotational basis. However, participants should avoid getting carried away by the recovery and remain selective, focusing on performing sectors and themes while keeping position sizes in check amid lingering geopolitical uncertainty and the approaching Union Budget. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities After initial weakness, the Nifty gained strength and closed higher. Overall, it maintained its position above the 50 EMA on the hourly chart. The RSI has remained in a positive crossover on the hourly timeframe. With Friday being the last trading session ahead of the Budget, a relatively contained movement can be expected. On the higher end, 25,500 is likely to act as a crucial resistance. On the lower end, immediate support is placed at 25,200, below which a sharp decline may be seen in the market. Abhinav Tiwari, Research Analyst at Bonanza Today, the Indian stock markets recovered strongly, after a volatile start. The Sensex ended 221 points higher at 82,566, while the Nifty 50 closed above 25,400. The recovery was driven by three key factors. First, the recently finalized India–EU FTA boosted market sentiment. Second, FIIs turned buyers after selling for 15 straight sessions, investing Rs. 480 crore in the cash market. DIIs continued to provide strong support, with inflows of Rs. 3,360 crore, helping stabilize the market. Third, the Economic Survey 2025-26 reassured investors about India’s macro strength. It projected GDP growth of 7.4% in FY26 and 7.2% in FY27, highlighted low inflation, improved bank asset quality, and continued government capital spending to support growth. Sector wise, metal stocks outperformed sharply, led by Hindustan Copper, supported by strong commodity prices and infrastructure demand expectations. In contrast, IT stocks declined, while FMCG and auto stocks saw mild profit booking. Looking ahead, markets may remain volatile until the Union Budget.

"Coal India, BCCL shares rise up to 5% as govt designates coking coal as critical mineral",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/coal-india-bccl-shares-rise-up-to-5-as-govt-designates-coking-coal-as-critical-mineral-13797237.html,"The shares of Coal India and Bharat Coking Coal sharply gained in trade on January 29 after the government designated coking coal as a 'Critical and Strategic Mineral' under the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957. The newly-listed shares of Bharat Coking Coal (BCCL) jumped nearly 5 percent to Rs 39 apiece in the afternoon trading hours of Thursday. Coal India shares meanwhile gained around 3 percent to Rs 456.95 apiece. Govt designates coking coal as critical mineral: The Ministry of Coal is a press statement said that the decision was taken on the basis of the recommendations of the High-Level Committee on Implementation of Viksit Bharat Goals (HLC-VB) and policy inputs from NITI Aayog, recognising the “strategic role of coking coal in ensuring mineral security and meeting the requirements of the domestic steel sector”. The ministry noted that India has approximately 37.37 billion tonnes of coking coal resources, largely located in Jharkhand, with additional reserves in Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal and Chhattisgarh. “Despite this domestic availability, imports of coking coal have increased from 51.20 million tonnes in 2020–21 to 57.58 million tonnes in 2024–25. Currently, around 95 % of the coking coal requirement of the steel sector is met through imports, leading to significant foreign exchange outgo,” it added. The inclusion of coking coal in the category will likely facilitate faster approvals, improve ease of doing business and accelerate exploration and mining activities, including of deep-seated deposits, the government said. “Mining of critical minerals is exempt from public consultation requirements and permits the utilisation of degraded forest land for compensatory afforestation, measures that are also expected to encourage greater private sector participation,” it added. The amendment is expected to reduce India’s import dependence, strengthen supply-chain resilience for the steel sector, and support the objectives of the National Steel Policy, according to the ministry. What the Economic Survey said about coal: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman tabled the Economic Survey in the Parliament earlier today. According to the survey, coal “remains crucial” as India has the fifth-largest coal reserves and is the second-largest consumer. Coal contributes 55 percent to the national energy mix and fuels over 74 percent of total power generation, it added. The survey noted that India’s coal industry reached historic heights in FY25, producing 1,047.52 million tonnes (MT) of coal. This marked a 4.98 percent year-on-year (YoY) increase from the Rs 997.83 MT. “This represents the highest coal production the country has ever achieved, demonstrating the industry's impressive growth and importance to India's energy needs,” it added. “Driven by this strong domestic output, imports registered a significant 7.9 per cent decline, falling from 264.53 MT in FY24 to 243.62 MT in FY25.15 Furthermore, the ratio of domestic production to consumption has also steadily improved over the past decade, as production growth has consistently outpaced consumption growth,” the Economic Survey further said. Additionally, the survey noted that India’s steel industry faces critical dependence on imported Coking Coal. “To mitigate global supply risks, the Ministry of Coal launched Mission Coking Coal in 2022 with a view to significantly enhance domestic raw coking coal production to 140 MT by 2030,” it said. Coal stocks: Coal India shares hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs 456.95 apiece today. The stock has gained around 8 percent in one week, and 14 percent in one month. Bharat Coking Coal shares made a stellar stock market debut on the exchanges earlier this month, listing with a premium of nearly 96 percent, following a massive subscription of 147 times between January 9-13 in the primary market. Shares of Bharat Coking Coal Ltd were listed at Rs 45 per share on the National Stock Exchange (NSE). The stock has so far declined around 13 percent since listing.

The stock touched an intraday low of Rs 438.25. The defence PSU on Wednesday reported a 20.4 percent rise in consolidated net profit for the December quarter, while revenue from operations grew nearly 24 percent year-on-year. BEL shares have gained 36.3 per cent so far in 2025 and are up about 13 per cent in January. Brokerage firm CLSA maintained an ‘outperform’ rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 453, noting that third-quarter execution was better than expected. However, it said much of the optimism is already priced in, adding that near-term stock movement will depend on execution of the company’s large order backlog amid lumpy order inflows. Kotak Institutional Equities reiterated its ‘sell’ rating with a target price of Rs 390, citing limited upside after the recent rally and an unfavourable risk-reward profile at current levels. JP Morgan, which has an ‘overweight’ rating on BEL with a target price of Rs 556, said the company’s earnings beat estimates but cautioned that margins may normalise. It added that growth will hinge on operating leverage and timely execution of orders. BEL is a constituent of the benchmark Nifty 50 index. The sharp decline in the stock also weighed on other defence stocks. The Nifty Defence index, which had risen for two consecutive sessions, snapped its rally and fell up to 2 percent on Thursday amid profit booking. Defence stocks had rallied over the past two sessions after India and the European Union concluded a defence and security agreement aimed at enhancing cooperation in areas such as counter-terrorism, the Indo-Pacific and joint development of military hardware. The pact was finalised at the India-EU summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, along with European Council President Antonio Costa. Officials said the agreement is expected to improve interoperability in the defence sector and create opportunities for Indian companies under the EU’s Security Action for Europe programme.

"IT shares decline up to 3% on profit booking after 2-day rise, Persistent Systems, TCS, HCLTech lead losses; here are likely triggers",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/it-shares-decline-up-to-3-on-profit-booking-after-2-day-rise-persistent-systems-tcs-hcltech-lead-losses-here-are-likely-triggers-13796653.html,"IT shares declined up to 3 percent on Thursday after two sessions of gains, as investors booked profits across the sector. Stocks such as Persistent Systems, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and HCL Technologies led the losses amid selling pressure. The Nifty IT index, which had risen 1.2 percent over the previous two sessions, gave up those gains and fell 1.5 percent in trade. Key factors behind the decline 1) US Federal Reserve decision: The fall came after the US Federal Reserve held interest rates, in line with expectations, citing elevated inflation and resilient economic growth. Markets are not pricing in another rate cut until the June policy meeting. Higher US interest rates tend to support the dollar and Treasury yields, making emerging markets such as India relatively less attractive for foreign investors. ""The Fed decision is likely to lead to short-term challenges in US rate-sensitive sectors. Globally, this may lead to a slight market decline as investors adjust to the expectation of no immediate rate cuts,"" said Rajesh Palviya, Head of Research at Axis Securities. The Indian IT sector, valued at about USD 283 billion, derives a significant portion of its revenue from the United States, making developments in the world’s largest economy critical for the industry. 2) Profit booking: After the recent rally, profit booking was seen across IT stocks, leading the Nifty IT index to surrender all its gains from the past two sessions. Shares of TCS declined more than 2 percent, while Persistent Systems emerged as the biggest laggard, falling up to 3 percent. Wipro, Tech Mahindra, Infosys and HCL Technologies were down up to 1 percent. All ten constituents of the Nifty IT index were trading in the red. 3) Weak US dollar: The US dollar extended its losses this week, slipping to a four-year low against a basket of currencies. A weaker dollar can weigh on Indian IT companies as it reduces the value of dollar-denominated revenues when converted into rupees, impacting earnings visibility for export-oriented firms.

"Q3 Results impact: SBI Card, SBI Life shares fall 3%; Gland Pharma surges 9% to two-month high",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/q3-results-impact-sbi-cards-sbi-life-shares-fall-3-gland-pharma-surges-9-to-two-month-high-13796631.html,"The shares of SBI Card and SBI Life dropped more than 3 percent each on January 29 after their respective Q3 results failed to impress D-Street. Gland Pharma shares meanwhile rallied more than 9 percent. The three companies had released their results for the October-December quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026 earlier yesterday. SBI Card Q3 Results: SBI Cards and Payment Services shares dropped 3 percent to trade at a near one-year-low of Rs 758 apiece, nearing its 52-week low of Rs 721 apiece. The stock has now snapped a two-session gaining streak. The company reported a net profit of Rs 556.64 crore for the third quarter of FY26. This marked a 45 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise from the Rs 383.23 crore net profit reported in the same period of the previous financial year. The firm’s revenue from operations meanwhile rose more than 11 percent YoY to Rs 5,127.26 crore during the quarter under review. Motilal Oswal said that net interest margins fell 11 percent sequentially, as most of the benefit from the lower cost of funds has already been realized, while yields carry a mild near-term downside bias, which could keep margins under check. “We reduce our earnings estimates by 4%/6.5% for FY26/FY27, considering a contraction in margins and a decline in receivables, while credit costs are likely to witness a modest decline. We expect SBICARD to post an RoA/RoE of 3.85%/17.9% by FY27,” the domestic brokerage said. It reiterated its ‘Neutral’ rating on the stock, but revised its target price to Rs 875 apiece. This implies an upside potential of nearly 12 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. SBI Life Q3 Results: SBI Life Insurance Company also fell more than 3 percent to trade at a one-month low of Rs 1,984.20 apiece, snapping a two-session gaining streak. SBI Life Insurance Company reported a net profit of Rs 576.74 crore for Q3 FY26, marking a 5 percent YoY increase from the Rs 550.82 crore net profit reported in Q3 FY25. This however included a one-time exceptional item arising due to the new labour codes. Goldman Sachs maintained a ‘Buy’ call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 2,385 apiece. This implies an upside potential of more than 16 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. The international brokerage noted that the firm’s VNB rose 22 percent YoY, driven by improved product mix. It however noted that margin declined by 35 bps YoY due to ITC loss. Jefferies said that improvement in APE growth is encouraging, but markets expected a slight upgrade as company's reiterated growth guidance of 13-14 percent. Gland Pharma Q3 Results: Gland Pharma shares gained more than 9 percent to trade at Rs 1,847.10 apiece, the highest level seen by the stock since November 14 last year. The company reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 261.47 crore for Q3 FY26, marking a 28 percent year-on-year (YoY) increase from the Rs 204.69 crore net profit reported in Q3 FY25. This was supported by strong sales in the key European and U.S. markets. The firm’s revenue from operations meanwhile grew around 22.5 percent YoY to Rs 1,695.36 crore.

"RPG Life Sciences close to acquiring 'major API asset', says MD Ashok Nair",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/rpg-life-sciences-close-to-acquiring-major-api-asset-says-md-ashok-nair-13796457.html,"RPG Life Sciences is closing in on acquiring a major active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) asset, with managing director Ashok Nair telling Moneycontrol that the Mumbai-based company has shortlisted some names and has opened talks, as he laid out an aggressive medium-term roadmap. “We have shortlisted some assets… some are under the process of due diligence,” Nair said in a post-earnings interview to Moneycontrol, adding the effort has now moved beyond exploratory scanning into active negotiations. The company is willing to pay up to Rs 1,000 crore for the right API asset. “We are okay to acquire something below 1000 crore… we have a cash surplus of Rs 225 crores and the group is ready to support us,” he said, signalling a mix of internal accruals and RPG Group backing the funding route. Acquisition strategy Nair said the company is targeting niche, low‑competition API portfolios in areas such as immunosuppressants, neuropsychiatry and cardiology. It is also seeking US‑approved facilities to accelerate entry into regulated markets. “We are looking… to acquire a plant which is US approved, so we can get in an easier way rather than putting into the whole rigour process of our own,” he said. The company prefers acquisitions over greenfield projects because of speed and competitive advantage. Nair says the valuations for API assets remain elevated. “APIs are around ranging from 8.5 to 13 to 14 times EBITDA… they have not cooled off,” Nair said. Recovering from fire The company is also emerging from a disruption caused by a fire at its API plant in Navi Mumbai in January 2025. “It took some time for us to restore… almost around 60 percent of our product validation has been done,” Nair said. He expects the plant to be fully operational by March 2026 and API segment to return to its previous performance levels. “By March 26, we are back in full‑fledged position… Q4 should do well for us in API,” he said. Despite the incident, Nair said, “All the clients have been very supportive of us. None of them have moved away.” He sees the API business returning to its normal 10–12 percent growth. Domestic branded formulations play continues RPG Life Sciences’ domestic formulations business, which accounts for 70 percent of the revenue, continued its strong performance, outpacing the Indian Pharmaceutical Market. “We have continued to maintain our momentum… we are at 12.6 percent growth as compared to market of 8.8 (percent),” Nair said. Key therapies such as nephrology (+17 percent), oncology (+22 percent percent) and monoclonal antibodies (+17.4 percent) are driving the surge. Flagship brands remain on track to scale rapidly. “Naprosyn is on the path to become a Rs100 crore brand by FY27,” he said of the company’s anti-inflammatory drug used to relieve pain, fever and inflammation. Nair said the company’s volume growth has been 5.3 percent as compared to 2.1 percent for IPM. Despite 30–32 percent of the portfolio being under price control, “we still have a gross margin of 70 percent”. The company is also expanding in specialty segments such as rheumatology and nephrology, with a future push planned for dermatology, gastroenterology, cardiovascular and urology. “Going forward, we would like to enter into clinical dermatology and gastroenterology (and) also strengthen cardiovascular and urology,” Nair said. Revenue target: Rs 1,000 crore by 2028 Nair outlined an aggressive medium‑term roadmap. “We are looking to be a thousand crore company by 2028 and by 2030, we should see how we achieve around 1,500 to 2,000 crore,” he said, adding both organic and inorganic levers, especially API scale‑up, would drive the expansion. Nair said RPG Life Sciences’ normalised EBITDA margin remains healthy despite temporary drag from the API plant outage. “This year, we are at 24 percent. Last year’s 30 percent had a one‑time reversal… actually the margin was 26.5 percent,” he said, adding “24–25 is a good EBITDA margin, going forward, we should maintain that.” RPG ended FY25 with revenue of Rs.653.4 crore, growing at 12.3 percent. Around two-thirds of revenue comes from domestic formulation, the rest from international formulations and exports. ""Although the APIs are expected to witness dent in FY26, we expect the business to start ramping up back as the refurbished Navi Mumbai API plant starts operations in H2 FY26. We have baked in revenues CAGR of 12% for domestic formulations, 14 percent in international formulations and 15 percent in API Business during FY26-28E,"" said the latest report of ICICI Direct Research on the company.","“We have continued to maintain our momentum… we are at 12.6 percent growth as compared to market of 8.8 (percent),” Nair said.","Last year’s 30 percent had a one‑time reversal… actually the margin was 26.5 percent,” he said, adding “24–25 is a good EBITDA margin, going forward, we should maintain that.” RPG ended FY25 with revenue of Rs.653.4 crore, growing at 12.3 percent.","Acquisition strategy Nair said the company is targeting niche, low‑competition API portfolios in areas such as immunosuppressants, neuropsychiatry and cardiology.","“We are okay to acquire something below 1000 crore… we have a cash surplus of Rs 225 crores and the group is ready to support us,” he said, signalling a mix of internal accruals and RPG Group backing the funding route.",positive,0.8965314626693726
