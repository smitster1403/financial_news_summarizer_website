"IT, metal, realty stocks tumble up to 4% as Trump's tariffs, FOMC meet outcome weigh",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/it-metal-realty-stocks-tumble-up-to-4-as-trump-s-tariffs-fomc-meet-outcome-weigh-13355880.html,"The shares of IT, metal and realty companies tumbled in morning trade on July 31 as Trump’s tariffs and penalty on India, along with the outcome of US Federal Reserve’s FOMC meeting weighed on Indian stock markets. While the sectoral indices were down more than 1 percent each, benchmark indices were down around 0.6 percent each. Sensex was down 460 points to hover around 81,022, while Nifty dropped 141 points to stand at 24,714. US President Donald Trump on July 30 announced 25 percent tariffs and an additional penalty against India ahead of the August 1 deadline. In a post on Truth Social, Trump described India as America's ""friend"" but added that it will face 25 percent tariffs plus a penalty for buying Russian military equipment and oil. The US President reiterated that India has among the ""highest tariffs in the world"". The US Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided to keep interest rates unchanged at 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent in the July 29-30 meeting. Nifty IT: The index dropped 1 percent to hover around 35,161 in the morning. The index has now snapped a two-day gaining streak. Coforge and Wipro shares were the top losers on the index, dropping nearly 2 percent each. Infosys, Mphasis and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) shares fell over 1 percent each, while Persistent Systems, Tech Mahindra and HCL Tech were down with marginal losses. The stocks in the sector have seen strong downturn recently, after heavyweight TCS announced significant layoffs, which in turn raised concerns over the broader industry. ""IT stocks remain under pressure, and justifiably so. The recent wave of layoffs and hiring freezes points to a demand environment that’s yet to normalize. While some anticipate a second-half recovery, the runway appears longer than previously expected. Budget cuts and delayed decision-making by global clients continue to weigh on sentiment. The space may need more time before a sustained uptrend materializes,"" said Bhavik Joshi Business Head, INVasset PMS. Nifty Metal Nifty Metal index dropped nearly 1 percent to hover around 9,331. The index has now extended losses for the second consecutive session. Hindustan Copper was the top loser on the index, falling more that 4 percent to trade at Rs 247 apiece. Adani Enterprises shares followed, dropped nearly 1.5 percent. The Adani Group company is set to release its results for the first quarter of the financial year 2026 today. NMDC, Jindal Steel and Power, Hindustan Zinc and Welspun Corp shares dropped more that 1 percent, while Vedanta, Hindalco, Tata Steel, Jindal Stainless Steel, SAIL and NALCO shares were trading in the red with marginal losses. ""Metals are bearing the brunt of tariff anxiety, but they’ve also corrected sharply in recent months. With global stimulus chatter rising and inventories low, this may be a setup for a reversion play once dust settles,"" Joshi said. Nifty Realty Nifty Realty dropped more than 1 percent to hover around 907. The index has now extended losses to the second consecutive session. Sobha shares were the top loser on the index, dropping more than 2 percent. Oberoi Realty, Phoenix Mills and Raymond shares followed, tumbling nearly 2 percent each. Prestige Estates and Anant Raj shares fell more than 1 percent each, while DLF and Brigade Enterprises shares were down in the red with marginal losses. Analyst Bhavik Joshi however holds an optimistic view for the sector. ""Real estate is quietly gaining strength. Institutional buying, robust pre-sales, and rising rental yields suggest that premium residential and commercial spaces are seeing genuine demand—not just speculative froth. This trend often leads the broader cycle,"" he said. Here's what analysts say: ""Given the current landscape of heightened volatility and mixed technical signals, traders are advised to adopt a cautious ""sell-on-rise"" strategy, particularly when operating with leverage. Booking partial profits on rallies and employing tight trailing stop-losses is essential to manage risk. Fresh long positions should only be initiated if the Nifty sustains above the 25,000 mark. While the broader market undertone remains cautiously bullish, it is crucial to monitor key technical levels and global developments closely,"" said Hardik Matalia, Derivative Analyst - Research at Choice Equity Broking Private Limited. However, recent progress in trade negotiations suggests a constructive path forward, and the trade deal between India and US will eventually follow provided both nations show the necessary political will, said Utsav Verma, Head of Research - Institutional Equities, Choice Broking. ""Many investors expect the tariff rate to eventually settle around 15%, paving the way for renewed confidence and stronger trade ties. In the short term, market will try to shed off its complacency. We do not expect huge knee-jerk reaction but a rangebound market focused on ongoing earnings,"" he said.

The surge in share price has taken HEG to nearly a year high, and up over 11 percent on a YTD basis. HEG posted a strong Q1FY26 net profit of Rs 71.8 crore from Rs 2.6 crore a year ago, with revenue up at Rs 613 crore from Rs 570 crore, along with a three-fold margin growth at 17.29%, which the management said is likely to go higher later in the fiscal. The company said its existing capacity utilization rate stands at 85-90%. The board also approved a 15,000 TPA graphite electrode capacity expansion, at a cost of around Rs 650 crore, which will be funded via internal accruals and debt if required, and is likely to be completed in 30 months. The capacity expansion by HEG can also be seen in the light of the US recently seeking to nudge its EV manufacturing to rely less on Chinese components. The US duty on Chinese graphite is expected to put pressure on the global supply chain, with China also squeezing export of critical minerals used by EV manufacturers. Earlier this month, the US announced plans to impose 93.5 percent of preliminary anti-dumping duties on graphite imports from China, accusing it of dominating the processing capacity and unfairly subsidizing its industry. Graphite is an important raw material used in the anodes of batteries of electric vehicles, with about two-thirds of the US supply coming from China in 2024. China is the dominant player in graphite processing, making it the most-exposed to potential supply risks and in urgent need for diversification, International Energy Agency had said in a report in May 2025.","HEG posted a strong Q1FY26 net profit of Rs 71.8 crore from Rs 2.6 crore a year ago, with revenue up at Rs 613 crore from Rs 570 crore, along with a three-fold margin growth at 17.29%, which the management said is likely to go higher later in the fiscal.","HEG posted a strong Q1FY26 net profit of Rs 71.8 crore from Rs 2.6 crore a year ago, with revenue up at Rs 613 crore from Rs 570 crore, along with a three-fold margin growth at 17.29%, which the management said is likely to go higher later in the fiscal.","Shares of graphite electrode maker HEG are higher by over 10 percent on turning profitable after a loss a quarter ago and announcing capacity addition worth Rs 650 crore, taking Graphite India's stock higher along by nearly 5 percent on July 31.","HEG posted a strong Q1FY26 net profit of Rs 71.8 crore from Rs 2.6 crore a year ago, with revenue up at Rs 613 crore from Rs 570 crore, along with a three-fold margin growth at 17.29%, which the management said is likely to go higher later in the fiscal.",positive,0.9506540894508362

While markets had braced for a possible tariff, the severity of the action caught traders off guard, triggering a wave of selling across sectors. At about 9:20 am, the Sensex was down 468.95 points or 0.58 percent at 81,012.91, and the Nifty was down 140.85 points or 0.57 percent at 24,714.20.

""The exact details of the tariffs on the exempted items, such as pharma and the ones that were charged at a differential rate such as iron, steel and auto is unknown as of now, but inclusion of pharma into tariffs should be incremental negative for India’s exports as US accounts for more than 30 percent of India’s pharma exports. If no deal is signed by September-October, we see a downside to the full-year GDP growth estimate for India by 20 bps,"" she added. At the open on July 31, market sentiment appeared cautious with most sectoral indices trading in the red. The Nifty Auto index led the losses, falling 1.16 percent, followed by declines in Nifty Consumer Durables (1.15 percent), Oil & Gas (1.65 percent), and Midcap 100 (0.93 percent). Banking stocks were under pressure as well, with Nifty Bank and PSU Bank down 0.59 percent and 0.78 percent, respectively. The Nifty IT and Metal indices also saw mild declines. On the volatility front, India VIX spiked 7.76 percent to 12.08, indicating a pick-up in market nervousness. Shares of Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) fell over a percent despite the company posting a strong set of numbers for the June quarter and issuing an upbeat outlook for the months ahead. The automaker reported a 32 percent year-on-year rise in net profit to Rs 3,450 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, driven by healthy demand for its high-margin SUVs and tractors. Revenue from operations grew 26 percent to Rs 34,143 crore, up from Rs 27,133 crore in the same period last year. Jio Financial Services Ltd (JFSL) shares gained almost a percent despite the weak market mood after the company unveiled plans to raise as much as Rs 15,825 crore through a preferential issue of warrants. The company’s board has cleared the proposal to issue 50 crore warrants at Rs 316.50 apiece—each warrant carrying a face value of Rs 10 and a premium of Rs 306.50. Technical View Market sentiment remains cautiously optimistic amid heightened volatility and mixed global cues. ""On the technical front, the Nifty formed a bullish hammer candlestick and closed above the previous day’s high, signaling the potential for a follow-up rally. The index is currently trading above its 100-day EMA, reflecting underlying strength. A close above the 50-day EMA at 24,935 would further confirm a bullish reversal. If this level is sustained, the index could advance toward 25,200 and eventually 25,800 in the coming sessions. On the downside, support is placed in the 24,590–24,400 zone, which could act as a potential area for dip-buying,"" Hardik Matalia of Choice Equity Broking said.

Olof Persson, CEO of Iveco Group said, ""By joining forces with Tata Motors, we are unlocking new potential to further enhance our industrial capabilities, accelerate innovation in zero-emission transport, and expand our reach in key global markets."" Tata Motors will also gain access to advanced electric and hydrogen powertrains, likely accelerating its clean mobility transition. Iveco is a leader in a vast range of advanced powertrain technologies in agriculture, construction, and commercial vehicles sectors. Girish Wagh, Executive Director of Tata Motors called the deal a 'strategic leap forward' in the ambition to build a 'future-ready commercial vehicle ecosystem'. The deal will see a continuation of the Iveco brand, with Tata Motors maintaining the corporate identity, as well as key brands and logos, positioning Tata Motors as a global CV powerhouse that can be comparable to Daimler Truck and Volvo. Iveco has been a strong 4 in European heavy truck sales with a 13% share, trailing Daimler (Mercedes), Volvo, and Scania. Renault Trucks, Volvo's subsidiary, reported 2024 revenue of €6.42 billion, Daimler Truck's 2024 group revenue was around €54.1 billion, while Iveco reported consolidated revenue of €15.29 billion last year. Together, Iveco and Tata Motors' commercial vehicle business will have combined revenue of €22 billion (Rs 2.20 lakh crore) across Europe (50%), India (35%) and the Americas (15%). The combined entity now boasts of a broader range of trucks, buses, and commercial vehicles, enhancing competitiveness, as well as new efficiencies in manufacturing, R&D, and supply chains. Italy's Iveco Group is breaking itself up to selling the defense unit to Leonardo, and the rest of the business to Tata Motors. The offer aims to acquire 100% of Iveco's shares with a subsequent delisting from Euronext Milan. This is the first major deal by Tata Motors nearly two decades after its purchase of Jaguar Land Rover in 2008.","""This is a logical next step following the demerger of the Tata Motors Commercial Vehicle business and will allow the combined group to compete on a truly global basis with two strategic home markets in India and Europe.","The landmark deal by Tata Motors to acquire Italian MNC Iveco is expected to shape Tata Motors’ global commercial vehicle (CV) strategy, with greater presence in international markets, and access to clean energy powertrains, besides a powerful brand in the CV category.",The development comes as Tata Motors is progressing towards a demerger to separate commercial and passenger vehicle businesses by March 2026.,"The deal will see a continuation of the Iveco brand, with Tata Motors maintaining the corporate identity, as well as key brands and logos, positioning Tata Motors as a global CV powerhouse that can be comparable to Daimler Truck and Volvo.",positive,0.8162187933921814
"Trump imposes 25% tariff on India: Markets unlikely to see any long-term earth-shattering impact, says Shankar Sharma",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trump-imposes-25-tariff-on-india-markets-unlikely-to-see-any-long-term-earth-shattering-impact-says-shankar-sharma-13353852.html,"The imposition of 25% tariff on India by the US will not have a major long-term impact on India and the Indian markets in particular as Indian exports to US are traditional in nature, including gems & jewellery, leather, textiles etc, says Shankar Sharma. From a market perspective, it is a non-issue but could act as a catalyst at a time when the sentiments are already subdued due to the ongoing lacklustre earnings season. “India exports nothing of great value to the US. It is all traditional exports like gems & jewellery, textile etc, which we have been doing for many years. I don’t think the 25 percent tariff will have a major long-term impact of any kind,” Sharma told Moneycontrol. Also Read: Industry 'disappointed' as US Imposes 25% tariff on Indian goods On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump announced a 25 percent tariff on Indian imports and an additional penalty effective from August 1. More importantly, the Indian tariff rate of 25 percent is higher than most other countries with which the US has reached an agreement -- European Union (15 percent), UK (10 percent), Indonesia (19 percent), Philippines (20 percent) and Vietnam (20 percent). The Indian tariff rate, however, is less than the current 30 percent rate for China. Meanwhile, Sharma is of the view that the US tariff development is a “non-issue” for the Indian markets, which are currently in the doldrums because of domestic factors. “The Indian market in any case is not in a good position and it has nothing to do with US tariffs. It is more to do with the corporate earnings and other local factors. Indian market has not done well in the recent past and is among the worst performers globally when compared with other leading equity markets,” said Sharma. Also Read: 'We're negotiating right now': Trump refers to BRICS, ‘tremendous’ trade deficit with India after announcing 25% tariff Indeed, as since mid-December, Indian benchmarks Sensex and Nifty are the worst performing benchmarks among all leading global indices. Since December 17, 2024, the Sensex and Nifty have each declined by nearly four percent, ranking them as the worst-performing among major global indices during this period. Only the Philippines Stock Exchange comes close with a decline of three percent. In sharp contrast, South Korea’s Kospi surged by 35 percent, followed by Germany’s DAX and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng with gains of 30 percent and 26 percent, respectively. Other notable performers included France’s CAC, Brazil’s Ibovespa, and the UK’s FTSE 100, each posting an increase of approximately 17 percent. “There could be some impact on the rupee. In the markets, the tariff news will have some impact on the sentiments but not a long-term earth-shattering one,” said Sharma.

The management, speaking on an analyst call post its Q1FY26 results, said that the company is well-positioned to meet its targets, backed by a steady stream of launches and tactical product refreshes. To be sure, M&M's Q1FY26 SUV revenue market share increased to 27.3 percent from 23.5 percent in the previous quarter, the company's investor presentation showed. Also read: Donald Trump announces 25% tariffs on India, slaps penalty over purchase of Russian equipment & energy ""We stay with our number"" the management said when asked about risks to SUV growth. ""We believe we can achieve this because we have two new electric SUVs and two more expected in calendar 2026. Minor variant refreshes, like the Rev-X2 on the XUV 3XO and updates to Scorpio N, have also helped."" The company added that further model actions are planned over the next few months, supported by a strong launch pipeline that could spill into early 2026 and support FY26 growth. However, the management flagged that any material deterioration in the macroeconomic environment could pose a risk, though current conditions support their guidance. On electric vehicles, Mahindra clarified that the improved profitability visible in the latest results does not include any benefits from the government’s Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme. The company said it has qualified for the PLI under the XEV90 programme but is awaiting the final technical audit. ""We expect the certification in Q2 or early Q3. Once received, we will accrue PLI benefits from near the launch period,"" the company said.

While Mahindra’s EV segment is still in early stages, the company pointed to improved operating leverage and strategic cost management as key contributors to profitability. Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd on July 30 reported a 32 percent jump in net profit at Rs 3,450 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, driven by robust demand for its high-margin sports utility vehicles and tractors. The carmaker's revenue from operations rose 26 percent to Rs 34,143 crore in Q1FY26 from Rs 27,133 crore in Q1FY25.

""We are comfortably covered on the rare earth magnet issue, as we have shared earlier. There has been no disruption to production because of that,"" the company told analysts. ""We’ve taken a series of actions — some related to inventory, others around substituting rare earth with light earth elements and ferrite materials."" Also read: Donald Trump announces 25% tariffs on India, slaps penalty over purchase of Russian equipment & energy The management added that Mahindra is covered for the current quarter and the next two, and “mostly covered” for the fourth quarter as well.

"Abbott India reboots Digene: old-school antacid, new school vibe",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/abbott-india-reboots-digene-old-school-antacid-new-school-vibe-13351239.html,"Heartburn may be timeless but the way India treats it is changing. Abbott India is giving its iconic antacid brand, Digene, a contemporary twist, introducing new formats for the modern, on-the-go consumer. Leading the makeover is Digene Insta On The Go, a single-dose, water-free stick pack that offers quick, discreet relief, a shift from the traditional tablet and syrup formats. “Digene Insta On The Go is a ready-to-use solution that fits seamlessly into the fast-paced lives of today’s consumers,” said Dr Jejoe Karankumar, Director of Medical Affairs at Abbott. “It was developed based on consumer insights that revealed a growing demand for portable solutions to manage acidity.” These launches are part of the company’s broader lifecycle management strategy, aimed at diversifying the Digene portfolio through new formats and flavours. “For over 80 years, Digene has been synonymous with acidity relief in India. Today, it’s a household name,” Karankumar said. Introduced by Boots in India as a prescription gel, Digene transitioned to an over-the-counter (OTC) product. The move was enabled by regulatory approvals and a shift in medical practice, as physicians increasingly prescribed newer proton pump inhibitors. Abbott repositioned Digene for direct consumer engagement, rolling out mass-market campaigns and expanding retail visibility. “We believe great brands are built on real insights and meaningful stories,” said Karankumar. “Our consumer-centric approach has been pivotal in developing Digene in various formats, tailored to meet different customer needs and preferences.” Campaigns like #ControlKar helped the brand maintain visibility in a competitive landscape dominated by rivals such as Eno, Gelusil, and Pudin Hara. In FY25, Digene posted sales of Rs 248.6 crore, at a 10 percent compound annual growth rate over four years. It remains one of Abbott India’s top-performing brands within its gastrointestinal portfolio, which grew 15.9 percent last year. India’s Rs 1,700 crore antacid category is growing at a CAGR of 8 percent. “To keep Digene meaningful and relevant, we took a deep dive into what the brand truly stands for—its purpose, values, and personality,” Karankumar added. “By listening closely to what people need and feel, we’ve built a strong connection with our audience—one that continues to grow with every story we share.”","India’s Rs 1,700 crore antacid category is growing at a CAGR of 8 percent.","“Digene Insta On The Go is a ready-to-use solution that fits seamlessly into the fast-paced lives of today’s consumers,” said Dr Jejoe Karankumar, Director of Medical Affairs at Abbott.","The move was enabled by regulatory approvals and a shift in medical practice, as physicians increasingly prescribed newer proton pump inhibitors.","“It was developed based on consumer insights that revealed a growing demand for portable solutions to manage acidity.” These launches are part of the company’s broader lifecycle management strategy, aimed at diversifying the Digene portfolio through new formats and flavours.",positive,0.5483546257019043

Click to View More Outlook for July 31 Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets traded in a tight range and ended marginally higher amid mixed cues. After a flat start, the Nifty oscillated within a narrow band throughout the session and finally settled at 24,855.05. Sentiment remained subdued due to lingering uncertainty over the trade deal, following the latest statement from the US President about potential tariffs on India, amid delays in finalizing the agreement ahead of the August 1 deadline. Additionally, caution prevailed ahead of the outcome of the FOMC meeting — while no rate change is expected, the Fed's commentary will be closely watched. On the sectoral front, a mixed trend kept traders active. IT and FMCG ended marginally in the green, while realty and auto declined. The broader market also saw mixed action — the midcap index closed flat, whereas the smallcap index slipped nearly half a percent. Participants will react to the US Fed Chair’s commentary in early Thursday trades. On the index front, the 25,000–25,100 zone is expected to act as a resistance and may attract fresh selling if the market attempts a rebound, while support is seen around the 24,450–24,550 zone. Given the likelihood of volatile swings, we recommend maintaining a cautious stance and prefer a hedged approach. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The Nifty traded within a narrow range, remaining below the 50 EMA on the daily timeframe. The short-term trend remains slightly weak as the index continues to sustain below this critical moving average. However, the possibility of a meaningful recovery stays intact, supported by a bullish reversal pattern formation and a hidden positive divergence. In simple terms, the index may continue to move up towards 25,000–25,200 in the short term, with support placed at 24,750. A break below this level could weaken market sentiment.

Markets end marginally higher ahead of US Fed rate verdict,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/markets-end-marginally-higher-ahead-of-us-fed-rate-verdict-13351123.html,"Indian equity markets ended slightly higher on July 30, ahead of the US Federal Reserve’s key interest rate decision scheduled for Wednesday. At the close of trade, the Sensex advanced 0.2 percent or 143.91 points to settle at 81,481.86, while the Nifty gained 33.95 points or 0.1 percent to finish at 24,855.05. U.S. markets remained largely steady, with S&P 500 futures showing minimal movement ahead of the Fed's rate announcement. The decision has sparked tensions between the White House and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 index remained volatile. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to maintain interest rates for a fifth straight meeting, despite increasing pressure from President Donald Trump to ease borrowing costs. Investors are closely watching for any indication that the Fed may adopt a more dovish stance in its September meeting. On the domestic front, sentiment was also cautious after President Trump stated on Tuesday that India could face a tariff of 20 to 25 percent—slightly below the 26 percent reciprocal tariff announced in April. However, he noted that the final decision is still pending as both nations continue trade negotiations ahead of the August 1 deadline. In stock-specific action, Larsen & Toubro was among the top performers, rising 5 percent after its first-quarter earnings exceeded expectations. In contrast, Tata Motors declined nearly 3 percent following reports that the company plans to acquire Italian truck manufacturer Iveco in a deal valued at around $4.5 billion. ""Markets traded in a tight range and ended marginally higher amid mixed cues. After a flat start, the Nifty oscillated within a narrow band throughout the session and finally settled at 24,855.05. Sentiment remained subdued due to lingering uncertainty over the trade deal, following the latest statement from the US President about potential tariffs on India, amid delays in finalizing the agreement ahead of the August 1 deadline. Additionally, caution prevailed ahead of the outcome of the FOMC meeting — while no rate change is expected, the Fed’s commentary will be closely watched,"" said Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking. ""On the sectoral front, a mixed trend kept traders active. IT and FMCG ended marginally in the green, while realty and auto declined. The broader market also saw mixed action — the midcap index closed flat, whereas the smallcap index slipped nearly half a percent."" ""Participants will react to the US Fed Chair’s commentary in early Thursday trades. On the index front, the 25,000–25,100 zone is expected to act as a resistance and may attract fresh selling if the market attempts a rebound, while support is seen around the 24,450–24,550 zone. Given the likelihood of volatile swings, we recommend maintaining a cautious stance and prefer a hedged approach,"" he added.","Indian equity markets ended slightly higher on July 30, ahead of the US Federal Reserve’s key interest rate decision scheduled for Wednesday.","On the domestic front, sentiment was also cautious after President Trump stated on Tuesday that India could face a tariff of 20 to 25 percent—slightly below the 26 percent reciprocal tariff announced in April.","Indian equity markets ended slightly higher on July 30, ahead of the US Federal Reserve’s key interest rate decision scheduled for Wednesday.","Sentiment remained subdued due to lingering uncertainty over the trade deal, following the latest statement from the US President about potential tariffs on India, amid delays in finalizing the agreement ahead of the August 1 deadline.",negative,0.9519382119178772

Apar Industries (APR) reported 27.3% YoY revenue growth while EBITDA margin declined 53bps YoY to 8.9%. The strong topline performance was underpinned by sustained domestic demand and some prebuying in the US amid tariff-related uncertainties. The management reiterated their guidance of ~10% volume growth in the conductors segment, driven by favorable macro tailwinds such as reconductoring opportunities, strong public capex and energy transition. Meanwhile, capacity expansion in the cables business is anticipated to support management’s target of ~25% revenue growth in FY26. The specialty oils segment faced near-term challenges due to project delays in key export markets, including Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Australia. Nevertheless, robust global demand for transformer and automotive oils is anticipated to offset these temporary headwinds. Heightened Chinese competition in non-US markets remains a key risk.

Revenue decline of 3.5% YoY is despite 8% YoY volume growth. Essential Chemicals segment, which accounts for ~70% of overall revenue, posted modest topline growth of 4%. However, gross margins for the segment declined by 400bps YoY and 100bps QoQ, impacted by falling prices of key raw material acetic acid, which compressed spreads in ethyl acetate (constitutes 80–85% of essentials basket).

GE Vernova T&D India (GVTD) delivered a strong quarterly performance, reporting 38.8% YoY revenue growth alongside a significant 1,013 bps YoY EBITDA margin expansion to 29.1%. The company remains wellpositioned to capitalize on growing demand for grid modernization, HVDC systems, and automation solutions.

The orders add to the existing orderbook and are expected to be executed over next 3-5 years, providing a 'steady revenue stream' with prototyping and full-scale production phases, said Axiscades. The latest orders are significant and add up to a third of the company's current orderbook which is reaching around Rs 1,800 crore. Spread across airborne, naval and radar-based platforms from defence laboratories, the orders involve development and supply of sub-systems for indigenous platforms being developed by DRDOs and other PSUs. This also deepens the company's involvement in key defence initiatives including fighter aircraft upgrades, naval modernization, and long-range surveillance radar systems, the company said. Axiscades listed out the key defence electronics programs and contributions that it has received in the latest order: 1. AESA Radar Program (Su-30 MKI Upgrade)The order involves development and supply of critical radar subsystems including the Exciter Unit, Receiver Unit, and Antenna Beam Control Motherboard. These components are vital and will replace the existing Russian radar on the Su-30 MKI, enhancing indigenous capabilities. 2. TR Modules for S-Band Surveillance RadarsDesign and delivery of advanced Transmit-Receive (TR) modules that significantly improve target detection, tracking accuracy, and signal fidelity in long-range surveillance operations. 3.

The shares were trading at Rs 3,651, emerging as the top Nifty 50 gainer. The company on July 29 reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 3,617 crore for the April-June quarter of the financial year 2026. This marks a 30 percent on-year rise from the Rs 2,786 crore net profit reported in the same quarter last year. According to a Moneycontrol poll of six brokerages, the net profit of the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) major was expected to grow 25 percent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs 3,469 crore. L&T's revenue from operations rose 15.5 percent on-year to Rs 63,679 crore in Q1 FY26, as against Rs 55,120 crore in the year-ago period. Moneycontrol's poll had projected the firm's consolidated revenue to rise 15 percent YoY to Rs 63,451 crore. The company said the order inflow for the quarter ended June 30, 2025 stood at Rs 94,453 crore, registering a growth of 33 percent over the corresponding quarter of the previous year, due to the strong ordering momentum from countries in the Middle East Should you buy, sell or hold Jefferies maintained its 'Buy' call on the stock, and raised its target price to Rs 4,230 apiece from the earlier Rs 3,965 apiece. The international brokerage said that the firm's Q1 EBITDA was 7 percent ahead of its expectations as execution was higher. L&T’s 33 percent on-year rise in order inflows puts the company in a comfortable position to meet guidance, it added. Jefferies however noted that the firm's 15 percent YoY revenue growth guidance looks low, given the order book growth. JM Financial kept a 'Buy' call on the stock, but hiked its target price by 12 percent to Rs 4,313 per share. This implies an upside potential of more than 23 percent from the stock’s previous closing price. “L&T delivered strong positive surprise with order inflows at INR 945bn materially higher than our estimate of INR 566bn. We are reasonably confident of L&T exceeding its order inflow target of 10% growth based on multi-year uptick in Middle East tendering,” the domestic brokerage said, while adding that L&T was its top pick in the infrastructure space.

"GNG Electronics shares make strong market debut, list at 50% premium to IPO price",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ipo/gng-electronics-shares-make-strong-market-debut-list-at-50-premium-to-ipo-price-13348511.html,"The shares of GNG Electronics made a strong market debut on July 30, listing at Rs 355 apiece on NSE. This marks a premium of nearly 50 percent over the IPO price of Rs 237 per share. The listing premium is higher than grey market estimates. Ahead of listing, the unlisted shares of the company were trading with a grey market premium of nearly 38 percent over the IPO price at Rs 327 apiece, according to Investorgain. The maiden public issue of GNG Electronics saw bumper investor interest during its three days of public bidding. The Rs 460-crore IPO was subscribed nearly 147 times its offer size between July 23 and July 25, with Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs) booking their reserved portion a whopping 266 times. The refurbisher of laptops, desktops and other information and communication technology (ICT) devices had launched its public issue to raise Rs 460 crore through a fresh issue of shares worth up to Rs 400 crore, and an offer for sale of 255 crore shares. The company had set a price band of Rs 225-237 for the IPO which remained open for public bidding from July 23 to July 25. Prashanth Tapse, Research Analyst at Mehta Equities, recommended investors to book profits. ""GNG Electronics made a solid market debut, largely in line with our expectations, reflecting robust investor enthusiasm. However, post-listing valuations appear stretched, limiting immediate upside potential from current levels,"" he said. ""In light of this, we believe conservative investors should consider booking profits and capitalizing on the initial momentum. While Investors with a higher risk appetite or a long-term horizon may choose to HOLD, given the company’s scalable business model, strong positioning within the SME tech segment, and alignment with favourable sectoral trends. These fundamentals, in our view, support sustained long-term growth despite potential short-term volatility,"" he added. Shivani Nyati, Head of Wealth at Swastika Investmart, meanwhile recommended investors to secure partial profits and retain the remainder with a stop-loss set at 280. Mahesh M Ojha, AVP - Research and Business Development, Hensex Securities, said, ""Short-term investors may partially book profits, while long-term investors should evaluate the company’s performance over the next two to three quarters before making further investment decisions,"" he said. Narendra Solanki, Head - Fundamental Research (Investment Services), Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers, said GNG Electronics may benefit from a first-mover advantage in the electronics refurbishment space, especially in B2B segments. However, he cautioned that the business model is working capital intensive, with a lag between procurement and sales cycles. ""We had recommended a ‘Subscribe – Long Term’ rating. Investors allotted shares could consider booking partial profits on listing and hold the remaining for long-term gains,"" Solanki added. Follow all IPO news here.

According to CNBC TV-18, discussions between Tata Motors and the Agnelli family-owned Iveco are centred around the commercial and defence truck business. Iveco has publicly acknowledged that it is exploring a potential sale of its industrial vehicle unit, although a final decision is yet to be announced.

It would also become Tata Motors’ biggest purchase since the $2.3 billion takeover of Jaguar Land Rover in 2008. The CNBC TV-18 report indicated that the boards of both companies could greenlight the deal as early as today. As per reports, trucks accounted for 70 percent of Iveco’s industrial revenue, while buses and powertrain divisions contributed 15 percent each. The Italian group held a 13.3 percent share in the light commercial vehicle (LCV) market in 2024 and had an 8 to 9 percent presence in the medium and heavy commercial vehicle space.

The firm's revenue fell marginally to Rs 8,939 crore in Q1FY26 as against Rs 8,970 crore in Q1FY25. The results are in line with estimates of a Moneycontrol poll of 7 brokerages. The poll pegged Asian Paints' Q1 revenue at Rs 8,905 crore and net profit at Rs 1,099 crore. Catch all the LIVE market updates on our blog Should you buy, sell or hold the Asian Paints stock? Jefferies has maintained a ‘Buy’ rating on Asian Paints and raised the target price to Rs 2,900 from Rs 2,830 per share. The new price implies an upside of 21 percent from the last close. The brokerage noted an improvement in decorative volume growth, which it sees as a key positive. Demand commentary from the company was encouraging, though the market remains competitive. Jefferies expects the recent correction in raw material costs to help absorb the impact of higher anti-dumping duties on titanium dioxide (TiO2). It views Asian Paints as a strong contrarian play, anticipating a recovery in volume growth ahead. HSBC also retained its ‘Buy’ call on Asian Paints but cut the target price to Rs 2,800 from Rs 2,900. The brokerage pointed to emerging green shoots in demand, although early monsoons have created a push-pull dynamic. It expects the company to benefit in the second quarter from an early festive season. While higher TiO2 prices remain a concern, these could be balanced out by softer prices for other raw materials. HSBC has lowered its FY27 and FY28 revenue and EBITDA estimates by 1–3 percent but continues to maintain a positive view, expecting a broadly stable competitive environment over the medium term. It forecasts a 12 percent EBITDA CAGR over FY25–28.

Asian Paints reported a 0.2 percent dip in India coatings revenue. The domestic decorative paints segment posted a 3.9 percent volume growth, while revenue declined 1.2 percent. Industrial coatings grew 8.8 percent, led by strong performance in the auto and protective segments. Operating margins were slightly lower year-on-year due to higher sales and marketing spends. The home décor business remained muted amid weak retail consumption, though the Beautiful Homes Stores performed well. International markets delivered robust growth, with revenue up 11.1 percent on a like-to-like basis and 20.4 percent in constant currency, driven by strong performance in the Middle East and South Asia.

Following the development, Nomura and HSBC initiated coverage with a buy on the counter. As part of the tie up, Ather Energy will focus on 'strategic mentorship' for deep-tech startups, along with infrastructure-related support for upcoming players in the EV value chain. Catch all the LIVE market updates on our blog Nomura and HSBC have set target prices of Rs 458 and Rs 450 per share, respectively. Both brokerages are upbeat on Ather’s growth prospects, driven by the accelerating shift towards electric vehicles in the two-wheeler (2W) segment. Nomura expects EV penetration in the 2W market to rise from 6 percent in FY25 to 19 percent by FY30. It believes ICE (internal combustion engine) volumes are likely to peak by FY30, aligning with the expected rollout of BS-VII emission norms. While legacy players had a clear edge in the ICE era, the EV transition has reset the playing field. As a result, market shares a decade from now could look very different, and long-term value creation will hinge on a company's success in EVs and exports. In this context, Nomura sees Ather as a significant beneficiary of the EV shift.

It believes Ather’s strong product quality and tech leadership are difficult to replicate, even for larger rivals with deep pockets. HSBC expects technology and distribution expansion to drive further market share gains. The brokerage forecasts a revenue CAGR of 47 percent between FY25 and FY28 and expects the company to achieve EBITDA breakeven by Q4FY27. It also notes that Ather’s stock performance will depend more on its execution than overall industry growth, with faster EV penetration offering meaningful upside to earnings and valuation. Bengaluru-based EV maker Ather Energy narrowed its net loss to Rs 234.4 crore in the January–March quarter of FY25, down from Rs 283.3 crore a year ago, driven by strong demand for its flagship family scooter, the Rizta. The company’s revenue for the quarter rose 29 percent year-on-year to Rs 676 crore, up from Rs 523.4 crore, driven by higher sales of 40,700 vehicles compared to 35,908 units in Q4 FY24.

However, higher investments towards product launches and R&D are likely to exert some pressure on margins. According to a Moneycontrol poll, Sun Pharma’s consolidated revenue is estimated to grow 8 to 9 percent year-on-year (YoY) to around Rs 13,500 to 13,800 crore, while net profit is seen rising 2 to 7 percent YoY to about Rs 2,900 to 3,050 crore. EBITDA is expected to come in the range of Rs 3,700 to 3,910 crore, with margin likely to decline slightly by 10 to 90 basis points YoY. BNP Paribas' revenue estimates, as mentioned in its note, are in line with consensus, while EBITDA is marginally higher, considering launch-related costs will ramp up from Q2 onwards. It went on to add that the full impact of two specialty product launches — Leqselvi and Unloxcyt — is likely to be felt in subsequent quarters. There is a narrow divergence in earnings estimates across brokerages, so any deviation from consensus could trigger sharp stock movement. What factors are likely to drive its earnings? Sun Pharma’s growth in Q1 is seen as broad-based but measured, with domestic formulations, US specialty sales, and some support from gRevlimid driving topline expansion. However, these gains could be partly offset by foreign exchange losses and higher launch-related costs. Sun Pharma is expected to deliver healthy double-digit domestic growth for an eighth consecutive quarter, according to Emkay Global's latest note. Thus, projecting a 10.5 percent YoY rise in India revenue, aided by strong performance in chronic and specialty segments. HSIE concurs, highlighting traction in chronic, CNS and specialty products, and adds that Sun is likely to outperform IPM’s \~7.2 percent growth, partly due to its branded chronic exposure. India business: Expected to grow 10 to 12 percent YoY, driven by volume gains, in-licensing deals, and new launches. Price hikes and medical rep expansion have also aided productivity, noted B\&K Securities. US business: Sales may rise 5 to 6 percent QoQ to about USD 460 to 488 million, supported by stable gRevlimid contribution and higher specialty sales, including Ilumya and Winlevi. Emkay estimates specialty revenue at USD 310 million, up from USD 295 million last quarter. However, the overall US market remains volatile amid channel stocking and pricing pressure. While Sun Pharma guided for USD 100 million of launch costs for new specialty products, we believe Q1 margins will remain stable with pressure emerging in later quarters, BNP Paribas noted. gRevlimid: Contribution expected to improve QoQ but remain lower YoY due to intensified competition. According to BOB Capital, Revlimid-linked growth is tapering, and gRevlimid sales are unlikely to be offset by new approvals in the near term. Margins: EBITDA margin may see a 10 to 90 bps YoY contraction, largely due to elevated R&D and forex losses. Sun incurred an estimated Rs 505 crore forex loss during the quarter, as per B&K Securities. What to watch out for in the quarterly show? Analysts will be keenly watching Sun’s commentary on its specialty portfolio, the ramp-up of newly launched drugs, and any guidance on margin trajectory, especially with USD 100 million in launch costs expected to reflect more meaningfully in Q2 onwards. Further, updates on US pricing dynamics, progress in pipeline drugs, and commentary around the tariff environment for pharma exports will be closely tracked. Sun Pharma remains one of our top picks in the sector, driven by its robust India franchise and differentiated US portfolio, mentions Nirmal Bang's latest note. It also cautioned that cost normalisation and price erosion in generics could act as a headwind.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Lupin, State Bank of India, Tata Chemicals, Syngene International, PI Industries, Escorts Kubota and others on July 30?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-lupin-state-bank-of-india-tata-chemicals-syngene-international-pi-industries-escorts-kubota-and-others-on-july-30-13346727.html,"The benchmark indices rallied for the first time in the last four sessions, with the Nifty 50 rising 0.57 percent on July 29. The market breadth was also supported by the bulls. A total of 1,744 shares advanced compared to 916 declining shares on the NSE. The market is expected to remain rangebound and consolidative in the upcoming sessions. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider: Amol Athawale, VP Technical Research at Kotak Securities Lupin | CMP: Rs 1,984.6 After a decline from higher levels, Lupin rebounded from its support zone and witnessed a steady recovery. Additionally, on the daily charts, the counter has given a breakout from its sloping channel formation. The recent upmove suggests a new leg of the bullish trend from current levels. For the next few trading sessions, Rs 1,910 could act as the trend-deciding level for the bulls. If it sustains above this level, we can expect a further uptrend toward Rs 2,120. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,120 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,910 LIC Housing Finance | CMP: Rs 598.25 After a short-term price correction, LIC Housing Finance is now available near its multiple support zones. The bullish momentum near the support area indicates that the downside is likely restricted. Therefore, the current rebound in the stock is expected to continue with a favourable risk–reward profile. As long as the stock is trading above Rs 575, the bullish texture is likely to continue. A move above this level could take the stock to Rs 640. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 640 Stop-Loss: Rs 575 State Bank of India | CMP: Rs 799.20 After a remarkable upmove on a weekly basis, SBI witnessed profit booking at higher levels. Following the recent selloff, the downward momentum appears to have paused. Moreover, the counter has found support near its multiple demand zones. The formation suggests a potential revival of the uptrend in the near future. For positional traders, Rs 770 would be the decisive level. Trading above this level would suggest continuation of the uptrend towards Rs 850. However, a close below Rs 770 may prompt traders to exit long positions. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 850 Stop-Loss: Rs 770 Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities Tata Chemicals | CMP: Rs 1,000 After a rangebound action over the past few weeks, Tata Chemicals witnessed a sharp upside breakout this week amidst volatility in the benchmark indices. The stock price moved above the crucial resistance of the consolidation range at Rs 960 on Tuesday and closed higher. Hence, there is a strong possibility of further upside momentum in the near term. Volumes have started to expand during the breakout, and the daily 14-period RSI shows a positive signal. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,105 Stop-Loss: Rs 940 Syngene International | CMP: Rs 711.4 Syngene has been forming a rounding bottom pattern on the weekly chart over the past few months. The current weekly candle pattern indicates a decisive upside breakout following the formation of a higher bottom at Rs 621 earlier this month. Volume has expanded during the breakout, and the weekly 14-period RSI shows a bullish indication. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 785 Stop-Loss: Rs 670 PI Industries | CMP: Rs 4,249.5 PI Industries has been in a decisive upside rally for the last 3–4 months. A bullish structure of higher tops and bottoms is visible on the weekly timeframe chart. After a minor downward correction recently, the stock is now poised to surpass the crucial hurdle around Rs 4,250 this week. Volume expanded on Tuesday during the upside breakout, and the weekly 14-period RSI pattern suggests more upside ahead. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 4,675 Stop-Loss: Rs 4,050 Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors Man Industries | CMP: Rs 454.8 Man Industries has been moving in a higher-high, higher-low structure within its upward-sloping channel since March 2025. In the previous session, the price managed to break out of its Rs 405–448 range with a gain of over 5%, which is a strong bullish sign. Last week, the price found support at the baseline (red) of the Ichimoku Cloud and rebounded nearly 9%. The medium-term support as per this indicator is near Rs 425. Additionally, the ADX is at 35, well above 25, indicating positive momentum is likely to continue. A break above Rs 461 can lift the price toward Rs 480 followed by Rs 500. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 480, Rs 500 Stop-Loss: Rs 442 Escorts Kubota | CMP: Rs 3,489.8 In the prior session, Escorts Kubota gained more than 2%. Last week, prices retested the downward-sloping trendline and are now near the previous swing high of Rs 3,500, suggesting growing bullish activity. A decisive break above this level could further boost positive momentum. Furthermore, the 15-period and 30-period EMAs have recently formed a bullish crossover. As long as this crossover remains intact, the daily bias remains on the bullish side. Escorts Kubota is currently on the verge of a breakout. A move above Rs 3,500 could lead to a trending rally toward Rs 3,620 followed by Rs 3,730. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,620, Rs 3,730 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,380 Coromandel International | CMP: Rs 2,495.4 In the previous session, Coromandel International gained more than 3%. The stock has managed to hold above the prior day’s low for the last seven trading sessions, which is a positive sign. On the daily chart, the stock is trading in a rectangular range between Rs 2,200 and Rs 2,520 since May 2025, indicating accumulation. A close above Rs 2,520 could result in a bullish breakout from this pattern. Additionally, the KST (Know Sure Thing) indicator is trading above the zero line after crossing above the signal line, implying a potential buildup in momentum in the coming sessions. A decisive break above Rs 2,520 is required for further buying, with targets of Rs 2,620 followed by Rs 2,700.

SEBI Imposes Rs 10 lakh penalty in insider trading case involving HDFC Limited and HDFC Bank,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sebi-imposes-rs-10-lakh-penalty-in-insider-trading-case-involving-hdfc-limited-and-hdfc-bank-13345992.html,"The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has passed an order on Tuesday, in an insider trading case related to the landmark merger of HDFC Limited and HDFC Bank Limited. In its adjudication order, Sebi imposed a penalty of Rs 10 lakh on the Rupesh Satish Dalal HUF. Sebi investigated trades conducted between November 2021 and April 2022, following a suspicious trading report submitted by the NSE regarding shares of HDFC Limited and HDFC Bank. The merger between HDFC Bank and HDFC Limited was announced on April 4, 2022, on the exchanges, leading to a 9-10 percent rise in the share prices of both entities. Sebi’s investigation revealed that the trades were strategically timed and concentrated in stocks directly affected by the merger news. Sebi emphasized that the valuation and structural details of the merger were material, price-sensitive information and had been misused. SEBI’s investigation found that a former Deloitte India employee was a friend of the son of Rupesh Satish Dalal and suspected that unpublished price-sensitive information (UPSI) was sourced through this connection. The Deloitte employee was part of the valuation team for the merger deal. Based on the UPSI, Sebi suspected that the Rupesh Satish Dalal HUF took derivative positions in the scrips of HDFC Bank Limited and HDFC Limited. Sebi also observed that, aside from HDFC and HDFC Bank, the HUF had only traded in Infosys contracts during the investigation period. The Sebi investigation report stated, “The Noticee had bought multiple call option contracts of HDFC Ltd. and HDFC Bank Ltd. prior to the announcement of the merger/amalgamation and sold the said call options post-announcement. From the aforementioned tables, it was observed that the Noticee earned a profit of Rs 5.67 lakh in HDFC and Rs 2.52 lakh in HDFC Bank.” In its order, Sebi noted: “As it has been established that the Noticee violated Regulations 3(2) and 4(1) of the PIT Regulations and Sections 12A(d) and (e) of the SEBI Act, the Noticee is liable for payment of a monetary penalty under Section 15G of the SEBI Act.” According to the Sebi adjudication order dated December 20, 2024, two individuals in the same case had settled the matter by paying Rs 39 lakh and Rs 35 lakh, respectively. The HDFC–HDFC Bank merger, completed in July 2023, was the largest in India’s financial sector, creating a financial behemoth with combined assets exceeding Rs 18 lakh crore. The incident reinforces Sebi’s stance on zero tolerance for insider trading.","The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has passed an order on Tuesday, in an insider trading case related to the landmark merger of HDFC Limited and HDFC Bank Limited.","From the aforementioned tables, it was observed that the Noticee earned a profit of Rs 5.67 lakh in HDFC and Rs 2.52 lakh in HDFC Bank.” In its order, Sebi noted: “As it has been established that the Noticee violated Regulations 3(2) and 4(1) of the PIT Regulations and Sections 12A(d) and (e) of the SEBI Act, the Noticee is liable for payment of a monetary penalty under Section 15G of the SEBI Act.” According to the Sebi adjudication order dated December 20, 2024, two individuals in the same case had settled the matter by paying Rs 39 lakh and Rs 35 lakh, respectively.","In its adjudication order, Sebi imposed a penalty of Rs 10 lakh on the Rupesh Satish Dalal HUF.","From the aforementioned tables, it was observed that the Noticee earned a profit of Rs 5.67 lakh in HDFC and Rs 2.52 lakh in HDFC Bank.” In its order, Sebi noted: “As it has been established that the Noticee violated Regulations 3(2) and 4(1) of the PIT Regulations and Sections 12A(d) and (e) of the SEBI Act, the Noticee is liable for payment of a monetary penalty under Section 15G of the SEBI Act.” According to the Sebi adjudication order dated December 20, 2024, two individuals in the same case had settled the matter by paying Rs 39 lakh and Rs 35 lakh, respectively.",negative,0.7060864567756653

Click to View More Outlook for July 30 Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Markets edged higher on Tuesday, gaining over half a percent and taking a breather after the recent decline. The Nifty index nearly tested the crucial support zone of its medium-term moving average, the 100-day EMA, in early trade, followed by a gradual recovery that lasted until the close. As a result, it ended near the day’s high at the 24,821.10 level. Notably, all key sectors contributed to the recovery, with realty, pharma, and energy emerging as the top gainers. The broader indices also found some relief, posting gains in the range of 0.81% to 1.05%. The recovery in the Nifty was driven by oversold positions in heavyweight stocks, coupled with the presence of strong support at the 100-day EMA. However, participants should avoid reading too much into a single-day bounce and remain focused on selective stock picking and disciplined trade management, given the next resistance around the 25,000–25,100 zone. Moreover, the upcoming derivatives expiry and global developments could add to market volatility in the near term. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities Nifty formed a bullish engulfing pattern on the daily chart, suggesting the possibility of a meaningful bullish reversal. On the 2-hourly chart, the index has started a recovery supported by a positive divergence. In addition, a hidden positive divergence is visible on the daily chart, further indicating the potential for a smart recovery in the short term. On the higher side, Nifty may move towards 24,950–25,000. A decisive move above 25,000 could trigger a rally towards 25,200. On the downside, support is placed at 24,750.

Eicher Motors Q1 Preview: Revenue to rise 17% on strong volumes; margins to dip on high ad spends,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/eicher-motors-q1-preview-revenue-to-rise-17-on-strong-volumes-margins-to-dip-on-high-ad-spends-13343733.html,"New Delhi-headquartered Eicher Motors Limited is set to release its earnings report for the first quarter of FY26 on July 31. Analysts expect a solid pickup in revenue on strong volumes and price hikes undertaken by the company. However, margins are expected to witness a sharp decline during the quarter. According to a Moneycontrol poll of seven brokerage firms, the Royal Enfield-maker is anticipated to record a 17.2 percent year-on-year increase in revenue, reaching Rs 4,959 crore. Net profit is projected to rise 3 percent to Rs 1,120 crore from Rs 1,088 crore in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year. Earnings estimates from analysts polled by Moneycontrol are in a narrow range, indicating that any positive or negative surprises could trigger a sharp reaction in the stock price. What factors could affect Eicher Motors' earnings? Strong volumes: The company registered a 17 percent increase in volumes to 2.65 lakh vehicles, compared with 2.26 lakh units sold in the same quarter of the previous year. EBITDA contraction: The EBITDA margin is expected to decline by nearly 400 basis points year-on-year during the quarter. Margins are expected to be weighed down by elevated marketing expenses and costs associated with new product launches, partly offset by operating leverage benefits. Commodity Pressures Persist: The company is likely to gain from price hikes taken over the past year and an increasing share of exports. However, persistent commodity inflation continues to drive up input costs, potentially limiting the full benefit to margins. What to look out for in the quarterly show? Investors will be keen to understand retail demand trends and the actual impact of marketing spends on sales performance. Commentary on the outlook for international markets will also be closely tracked. Guidance on FY26 production plans, along with management’s view on commodity cost headwinds or tailwinds during the quarter, will be important. Additionally, the market will look for updates on upcoming model launches. Eicher Motors' stock price was trading at Rs 5,459, higher by 1.4 percent from the last close on the NSE.

Analysts expect an uptick in revenue, driven by a strong product mix, better auto/farm volume growth and realisation. On the flipside, margins are likely to witness a slight decline during the quarter. According to a Moneycontrol poll of six brokerage firms, the automaker’s revenue is likely to rise 24 percent year-on-year to Rs 33,471 crore. Net profit is projected to jump 19 percent to Rs 3,112 crore, up from Rs 2,613 crore in the year-ago period. Earnings estimates from analysts polled by Moneycontrol are in a diverse range, indicating that any positive or negative surprises could trigger a sharp reaction in the stock price. Most optimistic brokerage -- Nirmal Bang -- has forecasted a 36 percent increase in net profit. On the flipside, HDFC Securities -- the most pessimistic brokerage -- projects a 9.2 percent rise in net profit. What factors could aid Mahindra and Mahindra's earnings? Strong Volumes: Automotive revenues are projected to grow 27 percent, supported by a 17 percent rise in volumes, led by robust demand in the SUV and export segments. Tractor segment revenues are likely to increase 13 percent, aided by a 10 percent volume growth. Rich Mix: The Thar maker is expected to witness a rise in average selling prices (ASPs) in the tractor segment by 2 percent, while ASPs in the automotive segment may rise 8.5 percent, reflecting a higher share of EVs and a lower contribution from LCVs. Margin Pressure: Analysts across brokerages expect EBITDA margins to trim. The Moneycontrol poll forecasts a 60 basis points drop driven by an increasing share of electric vehicles in the mix and rising steel prices. ""In the passenger vehicle segment, M&M will likely be the only player to report strong double-digit growth in UVs at 22 percent year-on-year on the back of new launches,"" Motilal Oswal said in its preview note. What to look out for in the quarterly show? Key areas to watch include the volume ramp-up plans for the BE.06 and XUV.e9, guidance on tractor volumes, and insights into rural demand trends. Investors should also keep an eye on the company's margin trajectory and its strategy to navigate the rare-earth magnet supply crisis, which could impact both costs and production, given M&M's high focus on EVs. M&M shares were trading at Rs 3,215, up 0.2 percent from the last close on the NSE. M&M shares are up 7 percent since the beginning of the year.

Most optimistic brokerage -- InCred Equities -- has forecasted a 1.2 percent decline in net profit. On the flipside, Motilal Oswal -- the most pessimistic brokerage -- projects a 19 percent drop in net profit. What factors could affect Maruti Suzuki's earnings? EBITDA Contraction: The country's largest four-wheeler OEM is expected to witness a 210 basis points decline in margins due to negative operating leverage, higher personnel cost due to wage increases revision, higher marketing and advertisement spends/ forex costs being partly offset by increased sales of CNG vehicles, exports and realignment of one-time costs in the previous quarter. Tepid Volumes: The company will witness a 1 percent rise in volumes during the first quarter. This comes after heavy rains, price hikes, and liquidity stress hurt showroom footfalls, while a high base and lack of fresh launches weighed on conversions. Maruti sold 5.27 lakh vehicles in Q1, up from 5.21 sold in the same period last year. UV Sales Drop: While the company's exports rose in Q1, this benefit was partially offset by a slight dip in the share of utility vehicles (UVs), which accounted for 30.7 percent of volumes in Q1FY26 compared to 31.3 percent in Q1FY25. ""Additionally, increased discounting in the entry-level vehicle segment is putting some pressure on overall margins and profitability,"" Axis Securities said in its automobile preview note. On a slightly positive note, Motilal Oswal says Maruti Suzuki is its top OEM pick. ""While its 1Q earnings are expected to be weak, we expect the same to revive in the balance 9M on the back of its new launches and ramp-up in exports,"" the brokerage added. What to look out for in the quarterly show? In the upcoming quarterly results, investors should track the company's margin trajectory and its strategy to navigate the rare-earth magnet supply crisis, which could impact both costs and production. Updates on EV production plans amid this constraint, as well as progress on new model launches—especially in the EV and premium segments—will also be key to watch. Maruti Suzuki shares were trading at Rs 12,358, higher by 0.2 percent from the last close on the NSE. Maruti Suzuki shares have risen 14 percent year-to-date.

Volumes grew 4% YoY (incl NSL’s low contribution volumes, total volume growth was 13% YoY). Higher royalties and other expenses negated the benefit of higher steel prices. The average NSR grew 5% QoQ, aided by better flat and long product prices, driven by the implementation of safeguard duty and higher GoI capex. Blended EBITDA/t was weak at Rs5,695/t adjusting for the prior period rail price revision impact of Rs 1.73bn. We expect even weaker Q2 as domestic prices have declined since early June on monsoon led weakness in demand.

Tendering process at ISP is in progress and mgmt. expects ordering by Q3. ISP’s 0.5mtpa debottlenecking expansion is expected by FY28E.

"Gensol Engineering seeks bids to lease its 4,000-car EV fleet for a monthly rental",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/gensol-engineering-seeks-bids-to-lease-4000-ev-on-monthly-rental-13342793.html,"Troubled EPC player Gensol Engineering, undergoing Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP), has released an advertisement seeking bids from interested parties to lease pre-owned electric vehicles for a fixed monthly lease rental. “The cars are available at a fixed monthly lease rental and a nominal down payment,” the Interim Resolution Professional said. Gensol Engineering, in the advertisement, said that around 4,000 pre-owned electric vehicles are available for lease in Delhi-NCR and Bengaluru. These electric vehicles were leased by Gensol Engineering to a related entity - BluSmart Mobility – which was founded in 2019 to provide sustainable urban transport. Following BluSmart’s troubles after the Gensol saga, many other players are likely willing to fill this space. Some of the companies running EV cabs in major cities - Evera Cabs, Uber Electric and Everest Fleet – are expected to bid for the lease of Gensol Engineering’s cabs. One veteran of the mobility business said, “There is enough space for EV cabs in urban mobility, as conscious customers prefer such cabs and are ready to pay higher charges for a good service.” He added, “…there is definitely a robust market for such cabs, but it will also depend on the condition of the vehicles, as the operations of BluSmart have been suspended since April, so the EV fleets of Gensol may require maintenance, especially the battery.” An email sent to Interim Resolution Professional Keshav Khaneja seeking further details of the leasing terms did not elicit any response. Operations of BluSmart were suspended following a Sebi crackdown against Gensol Engineering’s promoters. Market regulator Sebi had passed an interim order against Gensol Engineering on April 15, restraining the company and promoters from accessing the securities market. It also directed the promoters - Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi - to step down from the board of the company. Sebi had found in its preliminary investigation that loans of Rs 977.75 crore were taken from PSU NBFCs - IREDA and PFC - out of which only Rs 663.89 crore was for purchasing 6,400 electric vehicles. Moneycontrol was the first to report that Gensol Engineering was under Sebi scanner. Sebi had found that Gensol procured only 4,704 electric vehicles (EVs) against the 6,400 EVs for which it had secured funding, and spent only Rs 567.73 crore on electric vehicles. Sebi has alleged that the rest of the funds were not used for EV purchase but diverted for personal usage by the promoters. Rating agency ICRA had first flagged the issue of falsified documents of debt servicing for the first time, and Care Rating too also flagged concerns around Gensol Engineering in March this year. Sebi received a complaint in June 2024 relating to manipulation of share price and diversion of funds from GEL, and thereafter started examining the matter. After Sebi’s interim order, agencies such as Enforcement Directorate and Ministry of Corporate Affairs too have initiated investigations into the company.","One veteran of the mobility business said, “There is enough space for EV cabs in urban mobility, as conscious customers prefer such cabs and are ready to pay higher charges for a good service.” He added, “…there is definitely a robust market for such cabs, but it will also depend on the condition of the vehicles, as the operations of BluSmart have been suspended since April, so the EV fleets of Gensol may require maintenance, especially the battery.” An email sent to Interim Resolution Professional Keshav Khaneja seeking further details of the leasing terms did not elicit any response.","One veteran of the mobility business said, “There is enough space for EV cabs in urban mobility, as conscious customers prefer such cabs and are ready to pay higher charges for a good service.” He added, “…there is definitely a robust market for such cabs, but it will also depend on the condition of the vehicles, as the operations of BluSmart have been suspended since April, so the EV fleets of Gensol may require maintenance, especially the battery.” An email sent to Interim Resolution Professional Keshav Khaneja seeking further details of the leasing terms did not elicit any response.","After Sebi’s interim order, agencies such as Enforcement Directorate and Ministry of Corporate Affairs too have initiated investigations into the company.","One veteran of the mobility business said, “There is enough space for EV cabs in urban mobility, as conscious customers prefer such cabs and are ready to pay higher charges for a good service.” He added, “…there is definitely a robust market for such cabs, but it will also depend on the condition of the vehicles, as the operations of BluSmart have been suspended since April, so the EV fleets of Gensol may require maintenance, especially the battery.” An email sent to Interim Resolution Professional Keshav Khaneja seeking further details of the leasing terms did not elicit any response.",negative,0.8239585757255554

"Panasonic in talks to buy controlling stake in Focus Lighting for Rs 526 crore, says report; shares jump 5%",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/panasonic-in-talks-to-buy-controlling-stake-in-focus-lighting-for-rs-526-crore-says-report-shares-jump-5-13342421.html,"The shares of Focus Lighting and Fixtures jumped 5 percent to hit the upper circuit in morning trade on July 29. This comes after a report said that Panasonic is in talks to acquire a controlling stake in the NSE-listed light fittings-maker for nearly Rs 526 crore. Japan-headquartered Panasonic is planning to acquire the entire 55 percent shareholding of the firm's promoters, The Economic Times reported citing people familiar with the matter. The remaining 45 percent stake is owned by the public. A potential deal will trigger a compulsory open offer to the company's public shareholders for at least 26 percent stake, according to market regulator SEBI's guidelines, the report added citing sources. The acquisition would cost Panasonic nearly Rs 526 crore, including the potential 26 percent open offer, the report added. Negotiations are at an advanced stage, but the due diligence of Focus has brought certain issues to the surface which need to be addressed before signing the contract, the report said. Moneycontrol couldn't independently verify the report. The publication cited a spokesperson for Panasonic's electric works business divisions (formerly Anchor) as saying that the speculation appears to be unfounded, and no such information has been shared yet. Focus Lighting and Fixtures is engaged in the manufacturing and trading of LED lights and fixtures. The company had listed on NSE's SME platform in 2017. It was shifted to the mainboard segment in 2021. According to the latest data on the firm's shareholding pattern, Managing Director and Founder Amit Vinod Seth owns nearly 51 percent stake in the company. Its notable clients include Mercedes Benz, BMW, Tata Motors, Shoppers Stop and more, according to its website. The shares of the company have gained more than 2 percent in the past five days, but lost nearly 4 percent in the past one month. The stock is down more than 23 percent in 2025 so far.

"Australian court rejects X Corp.'s appeal in child safety case, orders legal costs",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/australian-court-rejects-x-corps-appeal-in-child-safety-case-orders-legal-costs-2025-07-31/,"MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — An Australian appeals court on Thursday ruled against X Corp., rejecting a challenge to a safety watchdog's demands for details on how the Elon Musk -owned company was combating widespread child exploitation material on its platform. Three federal court judges unanimously rejected X’s appeal against a federal court decision in October last year that the company was obliged to respond to a notice from eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant on child abuse material being shared on X, which is incorporated in Texas. The judges also ordered X to pay the commissioner’s legal costs. Inman Grant’s office describes itself as the world’s first government agency dedicated to keeping people safe online. Inman Grant has driven world-first legislation that will ban Australian children younger than 16 from social media platforms including X from December. The federal court case goes back to early 2023, when Inman Grant asked some of the world’s largest technology companies to report on what they were doing about child abuse material appearing on their platforms. A reporting notice, issued under Australia’s Online Safety Act, was sent to Twitter Inc., incorporated in Delaware, in February that year. Twitter merged with X the following month. X arguments against complying with Inman Grant’s order included that Twitter no longer existed as a legal entity and that X did not carry its predecessor's regulatory obligations in Australia. Inman Grant, a former Twitter employee, welcomed Thursday’s ruling. “This judgment confirms the obligations to comply with Australian regulations still apply, regardless of a foreign company’s merger with another foreign company,” she said in a statement. She said her agency would continue enforcing the Online Safety Act and “holding all tech companies to account without fear or favor, ensuring they comply with the laws of Australia.” “Without meaningful transparency, we cannot hold technology companies accountable,” she said. X lawyer Justin Quill said he had not yet read the appeals court judges’ reasons and could not comment on the possibility of a High Court appeal. The High Court only hears around 10% of appeal applications, so the federal court full-bench decision could be final in X's case. X’s media office did not immediately respond to an email request for comment on Thursday. In 2023, Inman Grant’s office fined X 610, 500 Australian dollars ($385,000) for failing to fully explain how it tackled child exploitation content. X’s response was considered incomplete or misleading. X refused to pay and the penalty is the subject of a separate and ongoing federal court case.","Three federal court judges unanimously rejected X’s appeal against a federal court decision in October last year that the company was obliged to respond to a notice from eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant on child abuse material being shared on X, which is incorporated in Texas.","Three federal court judges unanimously rejected X’s appeal against a federal court decision in October last year that the company was obliged to respond to a notice from eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant on child abuse material being shared on X, which is incorporated in Texas.","In 2023, Inman Grant’s office fined X 610, 500 Australian dollars ($385,000) for failing to fully explain how it tackled child exploitation content.","Three federal court judges unanimously rejected X’s appeal against a federal court decision in October last year that the company was obliged to respond to a notice from eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant on child abuse material being shared on X, which is incorporated in Texas.",negative,0.7779466509819031

Asian shares are mixed after South Korea makes tariff deal and US stocks fall,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/asian-shares-are-mixed-after-us-stocks-fall-on-weakened-hopes-for-a-september-interest-rate-cut-2025-07-30/,"MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Asian shares were mixed Thursday after most U.S. stocks slipped, as doubts rose on Wall Street about whether the Federal Reserve will deliver economy-juicing cuts to interest rates by September. Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.9% to 41,020.91 after the Bank of Japan kept interest rates steady at 0.5% and raised inflation projections. The move follows Tokyo’s trade deal with Washington. In Seoul, the Kospi edged down 0.3% to 3,244.40 after South Korea reached a 15% tariff deal with the U.S., with no levies on American goods like cars, trucks and farm products. The deal also includes South Korea's purchase of $100 billion U.S. energy imports and $350 billion worth of investments in the U.S. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index fell 1% to 24,920.67, while the Shanghai Composite Index slid 0.7% to 3,588.73. Australia’s S&P ASX 200 shed 0.1% to 8,743.80. India's BSE Sensex added 0.2% to 81,481.86. Taiwan's TAIEX rose 0.4% to 23,551.92. Rabo Bank, citing the U.S. trade deals with other countries, including Bangladesh, said in a commentary that “it appears to be only a matter of time before India agrees to terms to ensure that it retains favorable access to the US market and all of those other markets that (U.S. President Donald) Trump has demonstrated he has the power to direct through economic coercion.” Rabo added that the terms of a U.S.-India trade deal would almost certainly include Indian purchases of U.S. arms and energy products and preferential access to U.S. agricultural goods. “A potential loser in all of this is Australia. With the US sending more wheat to Indonesia and Bangladesh and more LNG to Japan and South Korea, Australian exports stand to be displaced from their traditional markets,” it added. Trump on Wednesday announced a 25% tariff on imports coming from India, along with an additional tax because of India’s purchases of Russian oil, beginning Friday. That’s when stiff tariffs Trump has proposed for many other countries are also scheduled to kick in, unless they reach trade deals that lower the rates. But the U.S. president said the two countries were still in negotiations. On Wall Street on Wednesday the S&P 500 edged down by 0.1%, coming off its first loss after setting all-time highs for six successive days. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 171 points, or 0.4%, and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.1%. Stocks felt pressure from rising Treasury yields in the bond market after the Federal Reserve voted to hold its main interest rate steady. The move may upset Trump, who has been lobbying for lower interest rates, but it was widely expected on Wall Street. Fed Chair Jerome Powell may have surprised investors by pushing back on expectations that the Fed could cut rates at its next meeting in September. Besides Trump, two members of the Fed’s committee have also been calling for lower rates to ease the pressure on the economy, and they dissented in Wednesday’s vote. But Powell would not commit to a September cut in rates, pointing to how inflation remains above the Fed’s 2% target, while the job market still looks to be “in balance.” A cut in rates would give the job market and overall economy a boost, but it could also risk fueling inflation when Trump’s tariffs may be set to raise prices for U.S. consumers. The Fed’s job is to keep both the job market and inflation in a good place. In other dealings on Thursday, U.S. benchmark crude oil lost 4 cents to $69.96 per barrel while Brent crude, the international standard, shed 13 cents to $72.34 per barrel. The U.S. dollar fell to 148.87 Japanese yen from 149.44.

"Day 2 of federal investigation into fatal midair crash of Army chopper, commercial plane opens",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/day-2-of-federal-investigation-into-fatal-midair-crash-of-army-chopper-commercial-plane-opens-2025-07-30/,"The National Transportation Safety Board enters a second day of public hearings Thursday on the January midair collision between an Army Black Hawk helicopter and a passenger plane that killed all 67 people aboard the aircrafts. On the first day, investigators highlighted a number of factors that may have contributed to the crash and the warnings about helicopter traffic that FAA received years before the tragedy over the Potomac River. It’s too early for the board to identify what exactly caused the crash. The board’s final report won’t be released until sometime next year. But it became clear Wednesday how small a margin of error there was for helicopters flying the route the Black Hawk took the night of the nation’s deadliest plane crash since November 2001. The January incident was the first in a string of crashes and near misses this year that have alarmed officials and the traveling public, despite statistics that still show flying remains the safest form of transportation. NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said an FAA working group raised concerns about all the helicopter traffic around Reagan airport and the risk of a collision in 2022, but the FAA refused to add a warning to helicopter charts urging pilots to use caution when this runway was in use. “This is the very event that this would have been the cautionary note for,” she said. Video and animation presented during the proceeding's first day showed the helicopter flying above the 200 feet (61 meters) altitude limit before colliding with the plane. Investigators said Wednesday the flight data recorder showed the helicopter was actually 80 feet to 100 feet (24 to 30 meters) higher than the barometric altimeter the pilots relied upon showed they were flying. So the NTSB conducted tests on three other helicopters from the same unit in a flight over the same area and found similar discrepancies in their altimeters. Dan Cooper with Sikorsky helicopters said that when the Black Hawk helicopter involved in the crash was designed in the 1970s, it used a style of altimeter that was common at the time. Newer helicopters have air data computers that didn’t exist back then that help provide more accurate altitude readings. Chief Warrant Officer Kylene Lewis told the board that she wouldn’t find an 80 to 100 foot discrepancy between the different altimeters on a helicopter alarming because at lower altitudes she would be relying more on the radar altimeter than the barometric altimeter. Below 500 feet (152 meters), Lewis said she would be checking both instruments and cross referencing them. Army officials said a discrepancy of 70 to 100 feet (21 to 30 meters) between the Black Hawk’s altimeters is within the acceptable range because pilots are expected to maintain their altitude plus or minus 100 feet. The greater concern is that the FAA approved routes around Reagan airport that included such small separation distances between helicopters and planes when planes are landing. “The fact that we have less than 500 foot separation is a concern for me,” said Scott Rosengren, who is chief engineer in the office that manages the Army's utility helicopters. During the two minutes before the crash, one air traffic controller was directing airport traffic and helicopters in the area, a task that involved speaking to or receiving communications from several different aircraft, according to the NTSB’s History of Flight Performance Study. The air traffic controller had spoken to or received communications from the Black Hawk helicopter, an airplane that was taking off, an Air Force helicopter, an airplane on the ground, a medical helicopter and an inbound flight that was not the American Airlines plane that would crash. “All aircraft could hear the controller, but helicopters could only hear other helicopters on their frequency and airplanes only other airplanes,” the report stated. “This resulted in a number of stepped on transmissions as helicopters and airplanes were not aware when the other was communicating.” Stepped on transmissions are those that are unheard or blocked because of other transmissions. The NTSB report provides a list of 29 separate communications between the airport tower and other aircraft during approximately the 1 minute and 57 seconds before the collision. Previously disclosed air traffic control audio had the helicopter pilot telling the controller twice that they saw the airplane and would avoid it. The animation ended with surveillance video showing the helicopter colliding with the plane in a fiery crash. Investigations have already shown the FAA failed to recognize a troubling history of 85 near misses around Ronald Reagan National Airport in the years before the collision, and that the Army’s helicopters routinely flew around the nation’s capital with a key piece of locating equipment, known as ADS-B Out, turned off. ___ Associated Press writers Leah Askarinam, Ben Finley and Rio Yamat contributed to this story.

Chinese researchers suggest lasers and sabotage to counter Musk’s Starlink satellites,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/chinese-researchers-suggest-lasers-and-sabotage-to-counter-musks-starlink-satellites-2025-07-30/,"ROME (AP) — Stealth submarines fitted with space-shooting lasers, supply-chain sabotage and custom-built attack satellites armed with ion thrusters. Those are just some of the strategies Chinese scientists have been developing to counter what Beijing sees as a potent threat: Elon Musk’ s armada of Starlink communications satellites. Chinese government and military scientists, concerned about Starlink’s potential use by adversaries in a military confrontation and for spying, have published dozens of papers in public journals that explore ways to hunt and destroy Musk’s satellites, an Associated Press review found. Chinese researchers believe that Starlink — a vast constellation of low-orbit satellites that deliver cheap, fast and ubiquitous connectivity even in remote areas — poses a high risk to the Chinese government and its strategic interests. That fear has mostly been driven by the company’s close ties to the U.S. intelligence and defense establishment, as well as its growing global footprint. “As the United States integrates Starlink technology into military space assets to gain a strategic advantage over its adversaries, other countries increasingly perceive Starlink as a security threat in nuclear, space, and cyber domains,” wrote professors from China’s National University of Defense Technology in a 2023 paper. Chinese researchers are not the only ones concerned about Starlink, which has a stranglehold on certain space-based communications. Some traditional U.S. allies are also questioning the wisdom of handing over core communications infrastructure — and a potential trove of data — to a company run by an unpredictable foreign businessman whose allegiances are not always clear. Apprehensions deepened after Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine made clear the battlefield advantages Starlink satellites could convey and have been exacerbated by Musk’s proliferating political interests. Musk pumped tens of millions of dollars into President Donald Trump’s reelection effort and emerged, temporarily, as a key adviser and government official. As Musk toys with the idea of starting his own political party, he has also taken an increasing interest in European politics, using his influence to promote an array of hard-right and insurgent figures often at odds with establishment politicians. Musk left the Trump administration in May and within days his relationship with Trump publicly imploded in a feud on social media. SpaceX, the rocket launch and space-based communications company that Musk founded and that operates Starlink, remains inextricably linked with core U.S. government functions. It has won billions in contracts to provide launch services for NASA missions and military satellites, recuperate astronauts stranded at the International Space Station and build a network of spy satellites for the National Reconnaissance Office. Starlink's space dominance has sparked a global scramble to come up with viable alternatives. But its crushing first-mover advantage has given SpaceX near monopoly power, further complicating the currents of business, politics and national security that converge on Musk and his companies. Since its first launches in 2019, Starlink has come to account for about two-thirds of all active satellites, according to Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who writes a newsletter tracking satellite launches. SpaceX operates more than 8,000 active satellites and eventually aims to deploy tens of thousands more. Beijing’s tendency to view Starlink as tool of U.S. military power has sharpened its efforts to develop countermeasures — which, if deployed, could increase the risk of collateral damage to other customers as SpaceX expands its global footprint. The same satellites that pass over China also potentially serve Europe, Ukraine, the United States and other geographies as they continue their path around the earth. Starlink says it operates in more than 140 countries, and recently made inroads in Vietnam, Niger, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Pakistan. In June, Starlink also obtained a license to operate in India, overcoming national security concerns and powerful domestic telecom interests to crack open a tech-savvy market of nearly 1.5 billion people. On the company’s own map of coverage, it has very few dead zones beyond those in North Korea, Iran and China. No other country or company is close to catching up with Starlink. Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos has taken aim at rival Musk with Project Kuiper, which launched its first batch of internet satellites into orbit in April. So far Amazon has just 78 satellites in orbit, with 3,232 planned, according to McDowell, and London-based Eutelstat OneWeb has around 650 satellites in orbit, a fraction of the fleet it had initially planned. The European Union is spending billions to develop its own satellite array — called the IRIS2 initiative — but remains woefully behind. EU officials have had to lobby their own member states not to sign contracts with Starlink while it gets up and running. “We are allies with the United States of America, but we need to have our strategic autonomy,” said Christophe Grudler, a French member of the European Parliament who led legislative work on IRIS2. “The risk is not having our destiny in our own hands.” China has been public about its ambition to build its own version of Starlink to meet both domestic national security needs and compete with Starlink in foreign markets. In 2021, Beijing established the state-owned China SatNet company and tasked it with launching a megaconstellation with military capabilities, known as Guowang. In December, the company launched its first operational satellites, and now has 60 of a planned 13,000 in orbit, according to McDowell. Qianfan, a company backed by the Shanghai government, has launched 90 satellites out of some 15,000 planned. The Brazilian government in November announced a deal with Qianfan, after Musk had a scorching public fight with a Brazilian judge investigating X, who also froze Space X’s bank accounts in the country. Qianfan is also targeting customers in Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Oman, Pakistan and Uzbekistan and has ambitions to expand across the African continent, according to a slide presented at a space industry conference last year and published by the China Space Monitor. Concerns about Starlink’s supremacy were supercharged by Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The war was a turning point in strategic thinking about Starlink and similar systems. Ukraine used the Starlink network to facilitate battlefield communications and power fighter and reconnaissance drones, providing a decisive ground-game advantage. At the same time, access to the satellites was initially controlled by a single man, Musk, who can — and did — interrupt critical services, refusing, for example, to extend coverage to support a Ukrainian counterattack in Russia-occupied Crimea. U.S.-led sanctions against Moscow after the full-scale invasion also curtailed the availability of Western technology in Russia, underscoring the geopolitical risks inherent in relying on foreign actors for access to critical infrastructure. “Ukraine was a warning shot for the rest of us,” said Nitin Pai, co-founder and director of the Takshashila Institution, a public policy research center based in Bangalore, India. “For the last 20 years, we were quite aware of the fact that giving important government contracts to Chinese companies is risky because Chinese companies operate as appendages of the Chinese Communist Party. Therefore, it’s a risk because the Chinese Communist Party can use technology as a lever against you. Now it’s no different with the Americans.” Nearly all of the 64 papers about Starlink reviewed by AP in Chinese journals were published after the conflict started. Starlink’s omnipresence and potential military applications have unnerved Beijing and spurred the nation’s scientists to action. In paper after paper, researchers painstakingly assessed the capabilities and vulnerabilities of a network that they clearly perceive as menacing and strove to understand what China might learn — and emulate — from Musk’s company as Beijing works to develop a similar satellite system. Though Starlink does not operate in China, Musk’s satellites nonetheless can sweep over Chinese territory. Researchers from China’s National Defense University in 2023 simulated Starlink’s coverage of key geographies, including Beijing, Taiwan, and the polar regions, and determined that Starlink can achieve round-the-clock coverage of Beijing. “The Starlink constellation coverage capacity of all regions in the world is improving steadily and in high speed,” they concluded. In another paper — this one published by the government-backed China Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team — researchers mapped out vulnerabilities in Starlink’s supply chain. “The company has more than 140 first-tier suppliers and a large number of second-tier and third-tier suppliers downstream,” they wrote in a 2023 paper. “The supervision for cybersecurity is limited.” Engineers from the People’s Liberation Army, in another 2023 paper, suggested creating a fleet of satellites to tail Starlink satellites, collecting signals and potentially using corrosive materials to damage their batteries or ion thrusters to interfere with their solar panels. Other Chinese academics have encouraged Beijing to use global regulations and diplomacy to contain Musk, even as the nation’s engineers have continued to elaborate active countermeasures: Deploy small optical telescopes already in commercial production to monitor Starlink arrays. Concoct deep fakes to create fictitious targets. Shoot powerful lasers to burn Musk’s equipment. Some U.S. analysts say Beijing’s fears may be overblown, but such assessments appear to have done little to cool domestic debate.

Ranchers say expanding herds to take advantage of record retail beef prices isn't so simple,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/ranchers-say-expanding-herds-to-take-advantage-of-record-retail-beef-prices-isnt-so-simple-2025-07-30/,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — In a period when retail beef prices are at an all-time high and consumers are still willing to pay, South Dakota rancher Calli Williams would love to cash in. But it's not so simple. Williams and her husband, Tate, raise about 70 cow-calf pairs near Letcher in southeastern South Dakota, roughly 18 miles (29 kilometers) north of Mitchell. They own about 80 acres (32 hectares) and rent additional pasture. Between the drought that hit cattle country hard over the last few years, still being maxed out on the grass available to feed their animals, and with land prices rising, she said, they simply can’t yet make the financial investments that they’d need to raise production. “It is a goal of ours to expand,” she said. “I’m just not sure if that will be in the 10-year plan or even longer.” Farmers and ranchers across the U.S. would love to take greater advantage of the high prices, but with the U.S. herd at record lows, they can’t meet the demand quickly. It's basic biology. “It takes three years to get more cows — between making a decision, having that gestation period, having the calf born, raising the calf until it, too, can have a calf,"" said Michael Swanson, chief agricultural economist for the Wells Fargo Agri-Food Institute in Minneapolis. The Williamses' county was hard hit by drought over the previous few seasons. Because of the lack of their grass and uneconomically high hay prices, they had to sell all their young females last year that could have produced more calves for them this year, she said. Their area has caught some rain lately, though. It has improved to just “abnormally dry” in recent U.S. Drought Monitor reports. But Williams said they’re simply playing catch-up. Swanson said some of the main cattle areas in North America — from Saskatchewan and Manitoba in Canada down to Texas in the U.S. — are just naturally prone to drought. It's often boom or bust. Colin Woodall, CEO of the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, said a lot of cattle country has had good rain this summer, but it's a cyclical business. “Sometimes we have good times, and sometimes we don’t,” Woodall said. “And we are just coming off what was a pretty significant negative hit to the cattle industry in ’19, ’20 and ’21, with the height of the pandemic. So we have a lot of producers who are still trying to pay off bills from those times."" And Woodall said his members are still leery. They're asking how long the better weather will last. “We’re getting some good moisture now. But will it be that way in the fall? Will it be that way next year?” he said. “Because the last thing you want to do is pay to rebuild your herd and then just have to liquidate them again in six months to a year.” Although it’s difficult to attribute any single weather event, such as a drought, directly to climate change, scientists say that rising temperatures stoked by climate change are increasing the odds of both severe droughts and heavier precipitation, which wreak havoc on people and the environment. When extreme weather collides with tight margins, farmers and ranchers feel the squeeze. Retail beef prices have hit record highs with no relief for consumers in sight. Ground beef rose to an average of $6.12 per pound in June, up nearly 12% from 2024. The average price of all steaks rose 8% to $11.49 per pound. And the average prices that producers receive for cattle and calves have increased from $1.51 per pound in May 2020 to $4.05 in May of this year. The total U.S. cattle herd is the smallest it has been at midyear since the government began keeping those figures in 1973, and probably since the 1950s. There were few signs in the U.S. Department of Agriculture data released last Friday that producers have begun rebuilding herds. As of July 1, the U.S. had 94.2 million cattle and calves, down from the last midyear peak in 2019 of nearly 103 million. Critical for the future supply, 2025 calf production is projected at 33.1 million head, down 1% from last year. Derrell Peel, a livestock marketing specialist at Oklahoma State University, said if producers were planning to grow their herds, the USDA reports would have shown them keeping heifers — female cows that haven’t given birth yet. While retail prices are high, consumers so far have been willing to pay them. Glynn Tonsor, who leads the Meat Demand Monitor at Kansas State University, said taste is the most important consideration when shoppers choose proteins — and beef remains the favorite. The late June report found that consumers were willing to fork out $17.62 a pound for rib-eye steaks and $8.82 for a pound of ground beef. That’s more than the $7.13 they’d pay for pork chops, $6.19 for bacon, or $8.55 for chicken breasts. A major reason, Woodall offered, is that the beef industry has focused on the eating experience. “The kind of beef that we are producing today is some of the highest quality, best tasting beef that we’ve ever produced in history here in the United States,"" he said. “So, things such as USDA prime graded steaks that at one point in time you could only get in a restaurant, you can now get that in a grocery store.” For consumers who balk at costs, the marketing specialist Peel said, pork and poultry are “abundant and quite favorably priced."" The Williamses, who are both 34, built their TW Angus business from scratch. Tate Williams started buying cattle when he was in high school, and they bought their land in 2015. They sell bulls in the spring and keep heifers when they can. They also raise steers in their own feedlot and sell the meat directly to consumers. “We would really like to expand our operation,"" Calli Williams said. ""We have a goal of being able to pass this on to the next generation,” Williams said, meaning their sons Jack, 7, and Tommy, nearly 4. But recalling a friend’s words, she said ranchers are a resilient bunch. “We’re optimistic that if Mother Nature — she wreaked havoc on us, whether that was a drought or a flood — that next year she’ll be kinder to us, “ she said. ”Or, if the markets weren’t on our side, we’re optimistic that the markets will be on our side next time.” Before you consider Wells Fargo & Company, you'll want to hear this.","Because of the lack of their grass and uneconomically high hay prices, they had to sell all their young females last year that could have produced more calves for them this year, she said.","Between the drought that hit cattle country hard over the last few years, still being maxed out on the grass available to feed their animals, and with land prices rising, she said, they simply can’t yet make the financial investments that they’d need to raise production.","Derrell Peel, a livestock marketing specialist at Oklahoma State University, said if producers were planning to grow their herds, the USDA reports would have shown them keeping heifers — female cows that haven’t given birth yet.","“Because the last thing you want to do is pay to rebuild your herd and then just have to liquidate them again in six months to a year.” Although it’s difficult to attribute any single weather event, such as a drought, directly to climate change, scientists say that rising temperatures stoked by climate change are increasing the odds of both severe droughts and heavier precipitation, which wreak havoc on people and the environment.",negative,0.4573058784008026
"Visa Beats Q3 Earnings Expectations, So Why Did the Market Panic?",https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/visa-beats-q3-earnings-expectations-so-why-did-the-market-panic/,"Visa NYSE: V is a dominant player in the worldwide payments industry, and even amid macroeconomic difficulties, the stock has delivered impressive performance in 2025 so far. As of the July 29 market close, Visa shares have provided a year-to-date (YTD) total return of more than 11%, moderately surpassing the approximately 9% total return of the S&P 500 Index. However, the company’s July 29 earnings release weighed on the stock. Although the firm beat expectations on both sales and earnings in the quarter, V stock fell by 2%-3% in after-hours trading. So, what caused markets to sell the stock after the results? And how does this impact Visa stock going forward? In its fiscal Q3 2025 results, Visa reported revenues of just under $10.20 billion, equating to 14% revenue growth. This solidly beat estimates of around 11% growth. The company also noted impressive adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.98, a 23% increase, beating the analyst estimate of 17%. However, Q4 guidance may have been responsible for the after-hours sell-off. The company forecasts “high-single-digit to low-double-digit” revenue growth in Q4, and sees EPS growing in the “high single-digit range."" These figures appear to be less than what analysts were hoping for. Payment volume growth, a key business driver, remained solid at 8% in constant currency. It remained stable compared to the prior year quarter and to fiscal Q2 2025, indicating that trade wars are not having much of a negative impact on consumers so far in 2025. The company called consumer spending ""resilient."" As Visa’s payment-driven business thrives on consumer health, this is good news for Visa investors. It is also good news for the overall market since consumer spending accounts for around two-thirds of the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP). The company’s value-added services (VAS) saw robust growth of 26% in constant currency, a solid acceleration from 22% growth last quarter. This is another positive sign, as VAS is also a key growth driver and increases the stickiness of Visa’s platform, helping solidify its market position. Management said VAS is “firing on all cylinders."" In general, Visa’s business remains healthy, with strong growth across key verticals, supporting the continued bullish thesis around the stock, as the company is well-positioned to benefit from long-term economic growth. Visa added notable color to two key initiatives, Visa Direct and stablecoins. Visa Direct is the company’s remittance platform. It enables foreign workers to send money back to their families in their home country. Banks and other financial institutions integrate Visa Direct into their platforms. Overall, Visa Direct saw a 25% increase in transactions and added several new banks to the platform during the quarter. The company's substantial progress on this front is key. Visa sees cross-border transactions as a relatively under-penetrated, enormous total addressable market (TAM). Thus, Visa Direct is a way for the company to drive strong growth for an extended period. The company thinks stablecoins will also be beneficial for capitalizing on this opportunity. The firm sees stablecoins as benefiting two key areas. The first is in emerging market economies, where local currencies can be volatile and people have limited access to U.S. dollars. Consumers and businesses may prefer to hold stablecoins tied to the U.S. dollar or euros, helping their money maintain its value. To capitalize on this opportunity, Visa is expanding its offerings of stablecoin-linked cards. The company is working to integrate stablecoins into Visa Direct. While Visa Direct often works well on its own, stablecoins can occasionally facilitate faster cross-border money movement. Early testing results have been good. Despite the drop in shares after hours, Visa remains a hard stock to bet against. Its long-term strength lies in its global scale, technological readiness, and forward-looking strategy. By combining resilient core payment demand with innovation in tokenization and stablecoin-enabled services, the company is expanding its addressable market while reinforcing platform loyalty. The conservative guidance may reflect prudence amid macro uncertainties, but it doesn’t undercut Visa’s strategic momentum. As more ways to pay emerge, Visa will likely be there and make money from them, adding significant weight to the finance stock’s bullish thesis.

Trump calls GOP's Hawley 'second tier' senator after bill to ban stock trades in government advances,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-calls-gops-hawley-second-tier-senator-after-stock-trading-ban-bill-advances-2025-07-30/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump lashed out at Sen. Josh Hawley on Wednesday after the Republican's proposal to ban stock trading by members of Congress — and the president and vice president — won bipartisan approval to advance in a committee vote. It’s the second time in as many days that Trump laid into senators in his own party as the president tries, sometimes without success, to publicly pressure them to fall in line. A day earlier, Trump tore into veteran GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa over an obscure Senate procedure regarding nominations. Trump called Hawley a “second-tier Senator” who was playing into the hands of Democrats. “I don’t think real Republicans want to see their President, who has had unprecedented success, TARGETED, because of the 'whims' of a second-tier Senator named Josh Hawley!” GOP senators had been working with the White House on the stock trade bill, and some supported a broad carve-out to exclude the president from the ban, but it failed, with Hawley joining Democrats to block it. Trump complained that Hawley joined with Democrats to block another amendment that would have investigated the stock trades of Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the speaker emerita, and her spouse. Paul Pelosi has been a much-watched trader, but Pelosi’s office said she personally does not own stock. Hawley did not immediately respond to Trump’s post. But Hawley’s legislation with the panel’s top Democrat, Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan, sailed out of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, after his support delivered a bipartisan vote over the objections of the other Republicans, who have majority control. In a joint statement, Hawley and Peters said the legislation, called the Honest Act, builds on an earlier bill and would ban members of Congress, the president, vice president and their spouses from holding, buying or selling stock. An earlier proposal from Hawley had focused more narrowly on lawmakers. “We have an opportunity here today to do something that the public has wanted to do for decades,” Hawley told the panel. “And that is to ban members of Congress from profiting on information that frankly only members of Congress have on the buying and selling of stock.” Stock trading by members of Congress has long been an issue that the parties have tried to tackle, especially as some elected officials have become wealthy while in elected office. During the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular, it was disclosed that lawmakers were trading as information about the health crisis became known. Insider trading laws don’t always apply to the types of information lawmakers receive. If the bill were to become law, it would immediately prohibit elected officials, including the president, from buying stocks and would ban them from selling stocks for 90 days after enactment. It also requires the elected officials to divest from all covered investments, but not until starting at the beginning of their next term in office — shielding Trump from that requirement. During the committee hearing, tensions flared as Republicans sought other approaches. GOP Sen. Rick Scott of Florida proposed one amendment that would exempt the president, the vice president, their spouses and dependent children from the legislation, and the other one that would have required a report on the Pelosi family's trades. Both were defeated, with Hawley joining the Democrats. “We are one step closer to getting this bill passed into law and finally barring bad actors from taking advantage of their positions for their own financial gain,” Peters said in a statement. Pelosi said she strongly supports the bill and looks forward to voting for it. “The American people deserve confidence that their elected leaders are serving the public interest — not their personal portfolios,” she said. She also gave nod to the dig in the initial Republican proposal — the Preventing Elected Leaders from Owning Securities and Investments, or Pelosi Act — which had focused more narrowly on the lawmakers. One Republican, Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, said the overall bill is “legislative demagoguery.” “We do have insider trading laws. We have financial disclosure. Trust me, we have financial disclosure,” Johnson said. “So I don’t see the necessity of this.” Trump’s post criticizing Hawley comes after a similar blowback directed Tuesday night at Grassley. In that post, Trump pressured Grassley to do away with the Senate's longtime “blue slip” custom that often forces bipartisan support on presidential nominations of federal judges. The practice requires both senators in a state to agree to push a nominee forward for a vote. Trump told Grassley to do away with the practice. “Senator Grassley must step up,” Trump said, while claiming that he helped the senator, who was first elected in 1980, to win reelection. Grassley earlier Wednesday said he was “offended” by what the president said. ___","“I don’t think real Republicans want to see their President, who has had unprecedented success, TARGETED, because of the 'whims' of a second-tier Senator named Josh Hawley!” GOP senators had been working with the White House on the stock trade bill, and some supported a broad carve-out to exclude the president from the ban, but it failed, with Hawley joining Democrats to block it.","“And that is to ban members of Congress from profiting on information that frankly only members of Congress have on the buying and selling of stock.” Stock trading by members of Congress has long been an issue that the parties have tried to tackle, especially as some elected officials have become wealthy while in elected office.",“So I don’t see the necessity of this.” Trump’s post criticizing Hawley comes after a similar blowback directed Tuesday night at Grassley.,"“I don’t think real Republicans want to see their President, who has had unprecedented success, TARGETED, because of the 'whims' of a second-tier Senator named Josh Hawley!” GOP senators had been working with the White House on the stock trade bill, and some supported a broad carve-out to exclude the president from the ban, but it failed, with Hawley joining Democrats to block it.",negative,0.5284337401390076
How Marvell Went From Short Target to Breakout Star,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/how-marvell-went-from-short-target-to-breakout-star/,"Marvell Technology NASDAQ: MRVL, a company that experienced underperformance and became a favorite among short-selling skeptics through the first half of 2025, has recently demonstrated a significant shift in momentum. Over the past five days, the stock has begun to recover, and in the final days of July, it has shown breakout momentum, signaling an apparent change in narrative. What was once a target for short-sellers has now captured market attention with what looks like the start of a powerful rally. This raises a crucial question for investors: What is driving the shift in market sentiment? For Marvell, the answer lies in a foundation of strong business results, suddenly ignited by a specific, confidence-boosting catalyst. Before the market-moving headlines of July 30, Marvell had already laid a foundation of strong fundamental performance. On July 24, the company released a preliminary report on its second-quarter fiscal 2026 results, signaling to the market that its business was running ahead of schedule. The full Q2 earnings report is expected after market close on Aug. 27. Management announced it expected revenue and earnings to finish at the high end of its previously guided range, implying revenue approaching or exceeding $2.1 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) at or above 72 cents. The company attributed this strength to two key factors. First, demand for its data center products, particularly those related to artificial intelligence (AI), accelerated faster than anticipated. This confirmed that its primary growth engine was performing at a high level. Second, management noted that the long-standing inventory correction in its enterprise networking business was finally showing signs of concluding. The stabilization de-risks the company's financial profile and provides a firmer foundation, allowing Marvell's high-growth AI story to drive overall results. That spark arrived on July 30. The primary trigger for the stock price jump on that day was a bullish sell-side report that, according to market commentary, specifically addressed and increased investor confidence in Marvell's custom-chip relationship with Microsoft NASDAQ: MSFT. The news directly countered the narrative of doubt that had weighed on the stock. Before the rally, Marvell was known as a favorite short play in some hedge fund circles, with uncertainty around its major customer programs being a primary reason for the skepticism. The positive analyst note directly targeted this concern, effectively neutralizing a key part of the bearish argument. This sentiment shift was accompanied by a tangible market signal from Morgan Stanley, which raised its price target on the stock from $73.00 to $80.00. The market’s reaction was immediate and powerful. After closing the previous day at $76.34, Marvell's stock gapped up at the open, beginning the trading day at $83.11. This type of significant price gap is a classic sign of overwhelming pre-market demand, typically driven by large institutions acting decisively on new information. The high trading volume throughout the day confirmed this was a broad-based move, suggesting a significant re-evaluation of the stock was underway. The rally did not happen in a vacuum. The company's strong underlying performance fully supports the newfound confidence sparked by the analyst report. The market's strong reaction on July 30 was a direct and logical consequence of investors finally digesting the solid fundamental news revealed just days earlier. This near-term execution fits perfectly within the company's long-term strategic vision. Marvell's goal is to capture 20% of the custom AI chip market by 2028, an objective that would dramatically reshape its revenue profile. The stronger-than-expected preliminary Q2 results and the renewed confidence in its key customer relationships serve as powerful, real-time proof points that this long-term plan is an achievable reality. Further bolstering its strategic position, Marvell recently appointed Rajiv Ramaswami, the current CEO of cloud software leader Nutanix, to its Board of Directors. This move adds a wealth of relevant cloud ecosystem and software expertise to Marvell's leadership, further aligning the company with the needs of its most important customers and strengthening its strategic vision for the future. The recent jump in Marvell's stock price represents what appears to be a significant sentiment reversal. A foundation of strong business results, ignited by a specific, confidence-shifting catalyst, has allowed the stock to break free from the skepticism that previously held it back. This positions the company as a potentially undervalued architect of the future of the AI Revolution.

Judge orders Trump administration to explain why order to restore Voice of America wasn't followed,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/judge-orders-trump-administration-to-explain-why-order-to-restore-voice-of-america-wasnt-followed-2025-07-30/,"A federal judge on Wednesday essentially accused the Trump administration of ignoring his orders to restore Voice of America's operations and explain clearly what it is doing with the government-run operation that provides news to other countries. U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth of the District of Columbia gave the administration until Aug. 13 to explain how it will get VOA working again. The outlet that dates back to World War II has been largely dark since March. Lamberth said the administration needs to show what it is doing with the $260 million Congress appropriated for VOA's operations this year. Kari Lake, the adviser appointed by Trump to run the government news agencies, said in June that 85% of employees at VOA and its overseers at the U.S. Agency for Global Media had lost their jobs. She called it a “long overdue effort to dismantle a bloated, unaccountable bureaucracy.” Lamberth said there's a process for eliminating funding that had previously been appropriated — Congress must vote on it, as it recently did for NPR and PBS funding. But that hasn't happened here, he said. He scolded the administration for providing “cagey answers” and omitting key information when asked for it in previous court orders. “Without more explanation, the court is left to conclude that the defendants are simply trying to run out the clock on the fiscal year, without putting the money Congress appropriated toward the purposes Congress intended,” Lamberth wrote. “The legal term for that is ‘waste.’” There was no immediate comment from the White House. ___ David Bauder writes about the intersection of media and entertainment for the AP.

But his radical overhaul of American trade policy, in which he's bypassed Congress to slam big tariffs on most of the world's economies, has not gone unchallenged. He's facing at least seven lawsuits charging that he's overstepped his authority. The plaintiffs want his biggest, boldest tariffs thrown out. And they won Round One. In May, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of International Trade, a specialized federal court in New York, ruled that Trump exceeded his powers when he declared a national emergency to plaster taxes — tariffs — on imports from almost every country in the world. In reaching its decision, the court combined two challenges — one by five businesses and one by 12 U.S. states — into a single case. Now it goes on to Round Two. On Thursday, the 11 judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, which typically specializes in patent law, are scheduled to hear oral arguments from the Trump administration and from the states and businesses that want his sweeping import taxes struck down. That court earlier allowed the federal government to continue collecting Trump’s tariffs as the case works its way through the judicial system. The issues are so weighty — involving the president’s power to bypass Congress and impose taxes with huge economic consequences in the United States and abroad — that the case is widely expected to reach the U.S. Supreme Court, regardless of what the appeals court decides. Trump is an unabashed fan of tariffs. He sees the import taxes as an all-purpose economic tool that can bring manufacturing back to the United States, protect American industries, raise revenue to pay for the massive tax cuts in his “One Big Beautiful Bill,’’ pressure countries into bending to his will, even end wars. The U.S. Constitution gives the power to impose taxes — including tariffs — to Congress. But lawmakers have gradually relinquished power over trade policy to the White House. And Trump has made the most of the power vacuum, raising the average U.S. tariff to more than 18%, highest since 1934, according to the Budget Lab at Yale University. At issue in the pending court case is Trump’s use of the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose sweeping tariffs without seeking congressional approval or conducting investigations first. Instead, he asserted the authority to declare a national emergency that justified his import taxes. In February, he cited the illegal flow of drugs and immigrants across the U.S. border to slap tariffs on Canada, China and Mexico. Then on April 2 — “Liberation Day,’’ Trump called it — he invoked IEEPA to announce “reciprocal’’ tariffs of up to 50% on countries with which the United States ran trade deficits and a 10% “baseline’’ tariff on almost everybody else. The emergency he cited was America's long-running trade deficit. Trump later suspended the reciprocal tariffs, but they remain a threat: They could be imposed again Friday on countries that do not pre-empt them by reaching trade agreements with the United States or that receive letters from Trump setting their tariff rates himself. The plaintiffs argue that the emergency power laws does not authorize the use of tariffs. They also note that the trade deficit hardly meets the definition of an “unusual and extraordinary’’ threat that would justify declaring an emergency under the law. The United States, after all, has run trade deficits — in which it buys more from foreign countries than it sells them — for 49 straight years and in good times and bad. The Trump administration argues that courts approved President Richard Nixon’s emergency use of tariffs in a 1971 economic crisis. The Nixon administration successfully cited its authority under the 1917 Trading With Enemy Act, which preceded and supplied some of the legal language used in IEEPA. In May, the trade court rejected the argument, ruling that Trump’s Liberation Day tariffs “exceed any authority granted to the President’’ under the emergency powers law. “The president doesn’t get to use open-ended grants of authority to do what he wants,’’ said Reilly Stephens, senior counsel at the Liberty Justice Center, a libertarian legal group that is representing businesses suing the Trump administration over the tariffs. In the case of the drug trafficking and immigration tariffs on Canada, China and Mexico, the trade court ruled that the levies did not meet IEEPA’s requirement that they “deal with’’ the problem they were supposed to address. The court challenge does not cover other Trump tariffs, including levies on foreign steel, aluminum and autos that the president imposed after Commerce Department investigations concluded that those imports were threats to U.S. national security. Nor does it include tariffs that Trump imposed on China in his first term — and President Joe Biden kept — after a government investigation concluded that the Chinese used unfair practices to give their own technology firms an edge over rivals from the United States and other Western countries.",The Trump administration argues that courts approved President Richard Nixon’s emergency use of tariffs in a 1971 economic crisis.,"On Thursday, the 11 judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, which typically specializes in patent law, are scheduled to hear oral arguments from the Trump administration and from the states and businesses that want his sweeping import taxes struck down.",Nor does it include tariffs that Trump imposed on China in his first term — and President Joe Biden kept — after a government investigation concluded that the Chinese used unfair practices to give their own technology firms an edge over rivals from the United States and other Western countries.,"The issues are so weighty — involving the president’s power to bypass Congress and impose taxes with huge economic consequences in the United States and abroad — that the case is widely expected to reach the U.S. Supreme Court, regardless of what the appeals court decides.",neutral,0.508131206035614

"Unsettled by NYC shooting, companies wonder if their offices are safe",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/unsettled-by-nyc-shooting-companies-wonder-if-their-offices-are-safe-2025-07-30/,"NEW YORK (AP) — Businesses around the country are reevaluating security after a brazen shooting at a New York City office building raised questions about what it takes to keep workplaces safe. The attack on a seemingly secure building — in a gilded part of Manhattan where the rich live in sprawling apartments and tourists window-shop designer stores — has rattled workers and prompted managers to examine whether they are adequately protected. “What should we be doing different?” clients are asking, said Brian Higgins, founder of Group 77, a Mahwah, New Jersey, security company that is among those getting peppered with an influx of calls. “How can we prevent something like this?” The gut reaction of some companies, Higgins said, is to buy the latest technology and blanket their workplace in cameras. But, he cautioned, that's only only effective if paired with consistency and long-term monitoring. “If you’re going to add a security measure … you have to make sure you maintain it,” said Higgins, a former police chief who teaches security at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. Four people were killed in the shooting Monday before the gunman died by suicide. Images of the shooter, toting a long rifle on a street in the biggest U.S. city, then terrorizing an office building, have companies desperate to do something to keep the scene from repeating. “People are frightened, people are asking questions,” said Dave Komendat, the Seattle-based chief security officer at Corporate Security Advisors, where calls are also spiking. With the U.S. locked in a pattern of gun violence virtually unparalleled in the world, security firms are used to the rhythms of the business. While attacks at a corporate office are less commonplace, a major shooting or an attack on an executive focuses attention back on security for a time, before receding. “Give it a couple weeks, a month or so, it’ll go back,” Higgins said of the increased call volume. “When security issues don’t happen for a while and companies start reexamining their budget, security is one of those things that companies cut.” Gene Petrino, CEO of Survival Response in Coral Springs, Florida, has also seen an uptick in calls from potential new customers, but expects it to be fleeting. “When things are calm it’s seen as an expense they don’t need right away,” he said, “and then when a tragedy happens it’s a priority again.” Petrino said companies can make changes that aren’t intrusive like using cameras with artificial intelligence capabilities to identify weapons. Sometimes, it may just be a matter of improving lighting in a hallway or putting up convex mirrors to see around a corner. “Everything doesn’t have to be bulletproof and locked with security cameras everywhere,” he said. “You don’t have to be Fort Knox. You can have very basic things.” Michael Evanoff, chief security officer of Verkada, a building security company based in San Mateo, California, said technology like AI-enabled cameras to help identify threats have become even more important amid a shortage of guards. “It’s harder than many realize to find and retain trained personnel,” Evanoff said. “That makes it even more essential that guards are equipped with technology that can extend their reach.” Security at 345 Park Avenue, the site of the shooting, included a New York Police Department officer working a uniformed security assignment. He was among those killed. Rudin, the leasing company that manages the building, did not respond to a query about when the building will reopen or whether new security measures will be implemented. No matter what, though, every workplace has vulnerabilities. “The security team has to be perfect to 100% of the time,” said Komendat, a former chief security officer for Boeing. “Someone like this just needs to be lucky once.”","“How can we prevent something like this?” The gut reaction of some companies, Higgins said, is to buy the latest technology and blanket their workplace in cameras.","“When security issues don’t happen for a while and companies start reexamining their budget, security is one of those things that companies cut.” Gene Petrino, CEO of Survival Response in Coral Springs, Florida, has also seen an uptick in calls from potential new customers, but expects it to be fleeting.","“When security issues don’t happen for a while and companies start reexamining their budget, security is one of those things that companies cut.” Gene Petrino, CEO of Survival Response in Coral Springs, Florida, has also seen an uptick in calls from potential new customers, but expects it to be fleeting.","With the U.S. locked in a pattern of gun violence virtually unparalleled in the world, security firms are used to the rhythms of the business.",neutral,0.8735434412956238
Recall issued over energy drinks mistakenly containing vodka,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/recall-issued-over-energy-drinks-mistakenly-containing-vodka-2025-07-30/,"MODESTO, Calif. (AP) — Energy drinks that mistakenly contain vodka are being recalled in half a dozen states. High Noon is recalling two production lots of High Noon Beach Variety packs because some packs include cans containing vodka that were mislabeled as Celsius Astro Vibe Energy Drink, according to a U.S. Food and Drug Administration recall notice Wednesday. The cans contain vodka seltzer and were mislabeled as “sparkling blue razz”-flavored Celsius Astro Vibe energy drinks, the notice said. Consumption of the liquid in the cans will result in “unintentional alcohol ingestion,” the company said. The packs were distributed to retailers in Florida, New York, Ohio, South Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin. The recall was initiated after the company discovered that a shared packaging supplier mistakenly shipped empty Celsius energy drink cans to High Noon. No illnesses or adverse events have been reported related to the labeling error, according to the company. Consumers who purchased the beverages with the impacted codes found in the recall notice should dispose of it, the notice said. Consumers are also encouraged to make sure any Sparkling Blue Razz Celsius Astro Vibe energy drinks do not contain the specific lot codes in the notice before drinking them.","The cans contain vodka seltzer and were mislabeled as “sparkling blue razz”-flavored Celsius Astro Vibe energy drinks, the notice said.","The cans contain vodka seltzer and were mislabeled as “sparkling blue razz”-flavored Celsius Astro Vibe energy drinks, the notice said.","MODESTO, Calif.

Palo Alto Networks: The All‑in‑One Cybersecurity Powerhouse,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/palo-alto-networks-the-allinone-cybersecurity-powerhouse/,"The technology sector is in a constant state of transformation. The rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and the shift to multi-cloud environments have created immense opportunities, but they have also opened the door to a more complex and dangerous generation of cyber threats. For years, enterprises fought back by deploying a patchwork of individual security tools, leading to a complicated and often ineffective defense. Today, that approach is changing. Businesses are now demanding simplification, seeking to consolidate their security with a single, integrated platform. This market shift has created a significant opportunity for a definitive leader to emerge, and Palo Alto Networks NASDAQ: PANW is making a compelling case that it will be that leader. Palo Alto Networks' core strategy hinges on a concept it calls platformization. The goal is to provide a single, unified platform that can replace dozens of separate security products, giving businesses a clearer and more effective way to manage their defenses. This strategy is built on three main pillars that cover the entire IT environment: This platform approach is being actively executed through strategic partnerships and acquisitions. To dominate the crucial new market of AI security, the company recently completed its acquisition of Protect AI on July 22, 2025. This move directly integrates AI model scanning and runtime protection into its Prisma platform, giving customers a secure way to adopt new AI technologies. Further, a recent expansion of its partnership with identity leader Okta NASDAQ: OKTA on July 15, 2025, allows for the unification of security and user identity, enabling automated threat responses that competitors with siloed products cannot easily match. This strategy is gaining traction, with the company securing 19 new platformization deals in its most recent quarter, proving that customers are buying into its unified vision. A successful strategy must translate into strong financial results, and Palo Alto Networks' financials are delivering. The company is proving that its platform-centric model is fueling a successful transition to a more predictable, high-growth business profile. Its Next-Generation Security (NGS) Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) is the most compelling evidence of this success. This metric, which tracks performance in high-growth areas like cloud security and AI-driven operations, surged 34% year-over-year to reach $5.1 billion as of April 30, 2025. This healthy growth confirms a successful shift from reliance on traditional hardware sales to a more durable software and subscription-based model. This is supported by impressive top-line performance. The company's total revenue grew 15.3% to $2.3 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2025, beating analyst expectations. Perhaps most impressively, Palo Alto Networks has delivered 12 consecutive quarters of positive GAAP net income, showcasing a rare and valuable combination of high growth and sustained profitability at scale. A company with ambitions to lead a market must sometimes make bold moves, and Palo Alto Networks appears ready to make its biggest one yet. Recent reports indicate the company is in advanced talks to acquire identity security leader CyberArk for a price that could exceed $20 billion. While the company has not confirmed the deal, such a move would be a decisive step toward creating a truly end-to-end cybersecurity platform. Integrating CyberArk’s best-in-class identity security would significantly widen Palo Alto's competitive moat. While the market reacted with some short-term caution to the rumored price tag, the long-term strategic benefit is clear. The move underscores the company's commitment to its platform vision. This ambition is reflected in the stock's premium valuation, with a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) that stands above 110. Such a valuation indicates that investors have high expectations for future growth, a belief that appears to be shared by Wall Street. The stock currently holds a Moderate Buy consensus rating from 41 analysts, with an average price target of $209.42. This confidence is rooted in the company's proven ability to execute its strategy and consistently deliver strong financial results. Palo Alto Networks has established a clear and aggressive strategy to dominate the consolidating cybersecurity market. The company backs its platform vision with decisive acquisitions and partnerships while delivering the impressive financial results needed to prove its success. Palo Alto Networks presents a compelling case as a market-shaping leader with a clear path for continued growth for investors looking for a core holding in the essential and growing technology sector.

"Microsoft's annual cloud revenue hits $75B, profit beats expectations",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/microsofts-annual-cloud-revenue-hits-75b-profit-beats-expectations-2025-07-30/,"Microsoft said Wednesday that annual revenue for its flagship Azure cloud computing platform has surpassed $75 billion, up 34% from a year earlier. The Azure cloud business is a centerpiece of Microsoft's efforts to shift its focus to artificial intelligence, but until Wednesday the company hadn't disclosed how much money it makes. The revelation came in the software giant's end-of-year earnings report, one that also showed a 24% spike in the company's quarterly profit that beat Wall Street expectations and pleased investors wary about Microsoft's ongoing construction of costly new data centers needed to meet cloud computing and AI demand. “We continue to scale our own data center capacity faster than any other competitor,” CEO Satya Nadella said on an investor call, boasting that the company now has more than 400 of the sprawling facilities across six continents. Microsoft's fiscal fourth-quarter profit was $34.3 billion, or $3.65 per share, beating analyst expectations for $3.37 per share. It posted revenue of $76.4 billion in the April-June period, up 18% from last year. Analysts polled by FactSet Research had been looking for revenue of $73.86 billion. Microsoft launched Azure more than a decade ago, but the service has increasingly become intertwined with its AI ambitions, as the company looks to sell its AI chatbot and other tools to big business customers that are also reliant on its core online services. It still trails behind its lead competitor, Amazon Web Services, which reported $107.6 billion in revenue for its fiscal year that ended in December. Building the infrastructure to power cloud and AI technology is expensive, and Microsoft has looked for savings elsewhere. It announced layoffs of about 15,000 workers this year even as its profits have soared. Nadella told employees last week the layoffs were “weighing heavily” on him but also positioned them as an opportunity to reimagine the company’s mission for an AI era. Still, the overall workforce numbers haven't changed. The company said it employed 228,000 full-time employees as of June 30, the exact same amount it reported a year ago, though slightly more of them are now U.S.-based and fewer of them are in product support roles or consulting services. Promises of a leaner approach have been welcomed on Wall Street, especially as Microsoft and other tech giants are trying to justify huge amounts of capital spending to pay for the data centers, chips and other components required to power AI technology. Google said after releasing its earnings last week it would raise its budget for capital expenditures by an additional $10 billion to $85 billion. Microsoft's chief financial officer, Amy Hood, said she expects capital spending for the July-September quarter to be $30 billion. Microsoft didn't disclose Wednesday to what extent sweeping U.S. tariffs are affecting its revenue, but its annual report lists tariffs among a number of risks the company faces. “Increased geopolitical instabilities and changing U.S. administration priorities create an unpredictable trade landscape,” the company said. It also said the ""volatility of U.S. tariffs has triggered economic uncertainty and could impact cloud and devices supply chain cost competitiveness.""","Microsoft launched Azure more than a decade ago, but the service has increasingly become intertwined with its AI ambitions, as the company looks to sell its AI chatbot and other tools to big business customers that are also reliant on its core online services.","Promises of a leaner approach have been welcomed on Wall Street, especially as Microsoft and other tech giants are trying to justify huge amounts of capital spending to pay for the data centers, chips and other components required to power AI technology.","Microsoft said Wednesday that annual revenue for its flagship Azure cloud computing platform has surpassed $75 billion, up 34% from a year earlier.","Microsoft launched Azure more than a decade ago, but the service has increasingly become intertwined with its AI ambitions, as the company looks to sell its AI chatbot and other tools to big business customers that are also reliant on its core online services.",neutral,0.9015343189239502
Meta stock surges after Q2 results blow past expectations despite heavy AI spending,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/meta-stock-surges-after-q2-results-blow-past-expectations-despite-heavy-ai-spending-2025-07-30/,"Meta’s artificial intelligence spending spree appears to be paying off with investors, who sent the company’s stock soaring after hours on Wednesday following a blowout quarterly earnings report. The Menlo Park, California-based company easily beat Wall Street’s expectations for the second quarter, helped by higher advertising revenue and a growing user base on its flagship social media platforms. The money is helping to fund the company's massive investments in AI development and hiring top talent at eye-popping compensation levels. “Not only has Meta made demonstrable strides with AI, but it’s helping to future proof itself as a growth company, should its family of apps get affected by the current anti-trust case or changing social media sentiment,” said Forrester research director Mike Proulx. Meta is facing an antitrust case that's now awaiting a judge's decision and could force the company to break off WhatsApp and Instagram, startups Meta bought more than a decade ago that have since grown into social media powerhouses. The company earned $18.34 billion, or $7.14 per share, in the April-June period. That's up 36% from $13.47 billion, or $5.16 per share, in the same period a year earlier. Revenue jumped 22% to $47.52 billion from $39.07 billion. Analysts expected Meta to earn $5.88 per share on revenue of $44.81 billion, according to a poll by FactSet. Meta's daily active user base on its apps — Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, Instagram and Threads — was 3.48 billion, up 6% year-over-year. Meta said it expects costs to increase as it spends billions on infrastructure and luring highly compensated employees as it works on its AI ambitions. It's forecasting 2025 expenses to be in the range of $114 billion to $118 billion, up 20% to 24% year-over-year. In the latest demonstration of his AI enthusiasm, CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday posted a note detailing his views on “personal superintelligence” that he believes will “help humanity accelerate our pace of progress.” While he said that developing superintelligence is now “in sight,” he did not detail how this will be achieved or exactly what “superintelligence” means. The abstract idea of “superintelligence” is what rival companies call artificial general intelligence, or AGI. It's the latest pivot for a tech leader who in 2021 went all-in on the idea of the metaverse, changing the company’s name and investing billions into advancing virtual reality and related technology. “Meta’s vision is to bring personal superintelligence to everyone. We believe in putting this power in people’s hands to direct it towards what they value in their own lives,” Zuckerberg wrote. “This is distinct from others in the industry who believe superintelligence should be directed centrally towards automating all valuable work, and then humanity will live on a dole of its output.” Zuckerberg said in a conference call he believes AI glasses are going to be “the main way we integrate superintelligence.” Last month, Meta invested $14.3 billion in AI company Scale and recruited its CEO Alexandr Wang to join a team developing “superintelligence.” The tech giant also cut a 20-year deal in early June to secure nuclear power to help meet surging demand for AI and other computing needs. Meta ended the quarter with 75,945 employees, up 7% from a year earlier. Meta's shares rose $81.87, or 11.8% to $777.08 in after-hours trading — on track to reach a record high Thursday after the stock market opens.","That's up 36% from $13.47 billion, or $5.16 per share, in the same period a year earlier.","In the latest demonstration of his AI enthusiasm, CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday posted a note detailing his views on “personal superintelligence” that he believes will “help humanity accelerate our pace of progress.” While he said that developing superintelligence is now “in sight,” he did not detail how this will be achieved or exactly what “superintelligence” means.","“Not only has Meta made demonstrable strides with AI, but it’s helping to future proof itself as a growth company, should its family of apps get affected by the current anti-trust case or changing social media sentiment,” said Forrester research director Mike Proulx.","“This is distinct from others in the industry who believe superintelligence should be directed centrally towards automating all valuable work, and then humanity will live on a dole of its output.” Zuckerberg said in a conference call he believes AI glasses are going to be “the main way we integrate superintelligence.” Last month, Meta invested $14.3 billion in AI company Scale and recruited its CEO Alexandr Wang to join a team developing “superintelligence.” The tech giant also cut a 20-year deal in early June to secure nuclear power to help meet surging demand for AI and other computing needs.",positive,0.3995320200920105

Rocketing Volume: 3 Stocks With Big Potential Moves,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/rocketing-volume-3-stocks-with-big-potential-moves/,"It seems that trading the S&P 500 index lately has become an afterthought for most investors on Wall Street, especially considering how little volatility there has been recently to compress the number of opportunities for a profitable run. However, that doesn’t mean money is just going to sit idly by; there are signs of activity elsewhere in the stock market. Some names have been picked up by traders in an unusual reading of trading volume, meaning a potential sign of accumulation or speculation for a short-term move in these chosen names. What this means for investors is that there is still a chance to capture some volatility outside of the indexes in the hopes of turning a profit, as these unusual traders have picked for themselves. A few of the stocks flagged in this unusual volume filter are Rocket Companies Inc. NYSE: RKT, Wendy’s Co. NASDAQ: WEN, and even PulteGroup Inc. NYSE: PHM. When investors consider the reasoning behind these picks, the current cycle in the real estate sector and a budget-friendly restaurant like Wendy’s becomes more understandable, given the current trading levels and the future fundamentals that could appeal to potential buyers. One of the best ways for investors to spot new opportunities is by identifying market outliers, which is mostly achieved by comparing a company's valuation multiples against those of its peer group. When it comes to Rocket Companies stock, the answer is clear as to why the market is valuing it the way it is. Because this stock trades at a price-to-cash (P/C) ratio of up to 71x today, it commands a massive premium to the rest of the finance sector’s 21.6x valuation multiple. Now, the reason why the market is willing to pay this much for the company’s cash needs some fundamental reasoning in order to be truly understood. Now that mortgage data is at the bottom of the cycle, with low volumes and high rates, it isn’t too far-fetched to see that Rocket’s cash in its balance sheet could be deployed aggressively in mortgage generation when mortgage rates inevitably swing lower and spark new demand and activity. This view might have driven traders to ramp up Rocket’s daily volume up to 64.3 million shares on July 22, a significant increase over the average, which is closer to 20 million shares per day. With this in mind, investors now have a fundamental view to bet on for Rocket, and some interested backers behind the stock to drive it higher as well. With consumers growing increasingly worried about inflation and controlling their budgets more rigidly, it makes no sense to bet against a company that caters to these needs and worries, and that is where Wendy’s stock comes into play. Over the past month, investors have seen this sentiment shift through the company’s short interest decline of up to 45.3%. In a clear sign of bearish capitulation, the obvious has been stated for the stock as it now trades at only 49% of its 52-week high, creating a very attractive risk-to-reward ratio in favor of the buyers, as most (if not all) of the downside scenarios in this stock have likely been priced in. Recording up to 19.3 million shares traded on July 22 as well, Wendy’s volume stood head and shoulders above its average of only six million shares, and it is no coincidence that Wall Street analysts have also come to push for higher prices. With a consensus price target of up to $15.3 per share, the Wall Street collective calls for a rally of up to 50.5% in Wendy’s stock for the coming months and quarters. Investors can now connect the dots between sentiment and a broad jump above the average trading volume for this stock. Most investors know that earnings per share (EPS) growth is what drives most of a stock’s performance, and that is where making the connection between Rocket’s upside and PulteGroup’s future growth can make this play easier to understand. If mortgage demand swings, so will homebuilding activity, which might be why Wall Street analysts see PulteGroup reporting up to $3.17 in EPS for the fourth quarter of 2025. Investors must note that PulteGroup reported $3.03 in EPS for the most recent quarter, beating expectations by up to 4% in an unexpected financial recovery. Given this sudden turn, it shouldn’t be a surprise if PulteGroup beats these expectations for the fourth quarter as well. The five million shares traded on July 21 justify a fivefold increase above the daily traded average. With these expectations in place, a new $150 price target by UBS analyst John Lovallo makes a lot more sense now, justifying the implied rally of up to 28% from where the stock trades today.

American Eagle's 'good jeans' ads with Sydney Sweeney spark a debate on race and beauty standards,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/american-eagles-good-jeans-ads-with-sydney-sweeney-spark-a-debate-on-race-and-beauty-standards-2025-07-30/,"NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. fashion retailer American Eagle Outfitters wanted to make a splash with its new advertising campaign starring 27-year-old actor Sydney Sweeney. The ad blitz included “clever, even provocative language” and was “definitely going to push buttons,” the company’s chief marketing officer told trade media outlets. It has. The question now is whether some of the public reactions the fall denim campaign produced is what American Eagle intended. Titled “Sydney Sweeney has great jeans,” the campaign sparked a debate about race, Western beauty standards, and the backlash to “woke” American politics and culture. Most of the negative reception focused on videos that used the word “genes” instead of “jeans” when discussing the blonde-haired, blue-eyed actor known for the HBO series “Euphoria” and “White Lotus.” Some critics saw the wordplay as a nod, either unintentional or deliberate, to eugenics, a discredited theory that held humanity could be improved through selective breeding for certain traits. Marcus Collins, an assistant professor of marketing at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business, said the criticism could have been avoided if the ads showed models of various races making the “genes” pun. “You can either say this was ignorance, or this was laziness, or say that this is intentional,” Collins said. “Either one of the three aren’t good.” Other commenters accused detractors of reading too much into the campaign's message. “I love how the leftist meltdown over the Sydney Sweeney ad has only resulted in a beautiful white blonde girl with blue eyes getting 1000x the exposure for her ‘good genes,’"" former Fox News host Megyn Kelly wrote Tuesday on X. American Eagle didn't respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press. The ad blitz comes as the teen retailer, like many merchants, wrestles with sluggish consumer spending and higher costs from tariffs. American Eagle reported that total sales were down 5% for its February-April quarter compared to a year earlier. A day after Sweeney was announced as the company's latest celebrity collaborator, American Eagle's stock closed more than 4% up. Shares were volatile this week and trading nearly 2% down Wednesday. Like many trendy clothing brands, American Eagle has to differentiate itself from other mid-priced chains with a famous face or by saying something edgy, according to Alan Adamson, co-founder of marketing consultancy Metaforce. Adamson said the Sweeney campaign shares a lineage with Calvin Klein jeans ads from 1980 that featured a 15-year-old Brooke Shields saying, “You want to know what comes in between me and my Calvins? Nothing.” Some TV networks declined to air the spots because of its suggestive double entendre and Shields' age. “It’s the same playbook: a very hot model saying provocative things shot in an interesting way,” Adamson said. Chief Marketing Officer Craig Brommers told industry news website Retail Brew last week that “Sydney is the biggest get in the history of American Eagle,” and the company would promote the partnership in a way that matched. The campaign features videos of Sweeney wearing slouchy jeans in various settings. She will appear on 3-D billboards in Times Square and elsewhere, speaking to users on Snapchat and Instagram, and in an AI-enabled try-on feature. American Eagle also plans to launch a limited edition Sydney jean to raise awareness of domestic violence, with sales proceeds going to a nonprofit crisis counseling service. In a news release, the company noted “Sweeney’s girl next door charm and main character energy – paired with her ability to not take herself too seriously – is the hallmark of this bold, playful campaign.” In one video, Sweeney walks toward an American Eagle billboard of her and the tagline “Sydney Sweeney has great genes.” She crosses out “genes” and replaces it with “jeans.” But what critics found the most troubling was a teaser video in which Sweeney says, “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color. My jeans are blue.” The video appeared on American Eagle’s Facebook page and other social media channels but is not part of the campaign. While remarking that someone has good genes is sometimes used as a compliment, the phrase also has sinister connotations. Eugenics gained popularity in early 20th century America, and Nazi Germany embraced it to carry out Adolf Hitler’s plan for an Aryan master race. Civil rights activists have noted signs of eugenics regaining a foothold through the far right's promotion of the “great replacement theory,” a racist ideology that alleges a conspiracy to diminish the influence of white people. Shalini Shankar, a cultural and linguistic anthropologist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, said she had problems with American Eagle's “genes” versus “jeans” because it exacerbates a limited concept of beauty. “American Eagle, I guess, wants to rebrand itself for a particular kind of white privileged American,” Shankar said. “And that is the kind of aspirational image they want to circulate for people who want to wear their denim.” Many critics compared the American Eagle ad to a misstep by Pepsi in 2017, when it released a TV ad that showed model Kendall Jenner offer a can of soda to a police officer while ostensibly stepping away from a photo shoot to join a crowd of protesters. Viewers mocked the spot for appearing to trivialize protests of police killings of Black people. Pepsi apologized and pulled the ad. The demonstrations that followed the 2020 killing of George Floyd by a white police officer in Minneapolis pushed many U.S. companies to make their advertising better reflect consumers of all races. Some marketers say they've observed another shift since President Donald Trump returned to office and moved to abolish all federal DEI programs and policies. Jazmin Burrell, founder of brand consulting agency Lizzie Della Creative Strategies, said she's noticed while shopping with her cousin more ads and signs that prominently feature white models. “I can see us going back to a world where diversity is not really the standard expectation in advertising,” Burrell said. American Eagle has been praised for diverse marketing in the past, including creating a denim hijab in 2017 and offering its Aerie lingerie brand in a wide range of sizes. A year ago, the company released a limited edition denim collection with tennis star Coco Gauff. The retailer has an ongoing diversity, equity and inclusion program that is primarily geared toward employees. Two days before announcing the Sweeney campaign, American Eagle named the latest recipients of its scholarship award for employees who are driving anti-racism, equality and social justice initiatives. Marketing experts offer mixed opinions on whether the attention surrounding “good jeans” will be good for business. “They were probably thinking that this is going to be their moment,"" Myles Worthington, the founder and CEO of marketing and creative agency WORTHI. ""But this is doing the opposite and deeply distorting their brand."" Melissa Murphy, a marketing professor at Carnegie Mellon University’s Tepper School of Business, said she liked certain parts of the campaign but hoped it would be expanded to showcase people besides Sweeney for the “sake of the brand.” Other experts say the buzz is good even if it's not uniformly positive. “If you try to follow all the rules, you’ll make lots of people happy, but you’ll fail,” Adamson said. “The rocket won’t take off. ”","“And that is the kind of aspirational image they want to circulate for people who want to wear their denim.” Many critics compared the American Eagle ad to a misstep by Pepsi in 2017, when it released a TV ad that showed model Kendall Jenner offer a can of soda to a police officer while ostensibly stepping away from a photo shoot to join a crowd of protesters.","“And that is the kind of aspirational image they want to circulate for people who want to wear their denim.” Many critics compared the American Eagle ad to a misstep by Pepsi in 2017, when it released a TV ad that showed model Kendall Jenner offer a can of soda to a police officer while ostensibly stepping away from a photo shoot to join a crowd of protesters.","Jazmin Burrell, founder of brand consulting agency Lizzie Della Creative Strategies, said she's noticed while shopping with her cousin more ads and signs that prominently feature white models.","In a news release, the company noted “Sweeney’s girl next door charm and main character energy – paired with her ability to not take herself too seriously – is the hallmark of this bold, playful campaign.” In one video, Sweeney walks toward an American Eagle billboard of her and the tagline “Sydney Sweeney has great genes.” She crosses out “genes” and replaces it with “jeans.” But what critics found the most troubling was a teaser video in which Sweeney says, “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color.",negative,0.4957881271839142
What we know about a new health data tracking system being announced by White House,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/what-we-know-about-a-new-health-data-tracking-system-being-announced-by-white-house-2025-07-30/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has announced a plan for a new private health tracking system that will make it easier for patients to access their health records and monitor their wellness across health care systems and technologies. The system, however, is raising a host of privacy questions. The collaboration between the federal government and Big Tech would allow patients to more seamlessly track and share their medical records or data among doctors, hospital systems and health apps, the administration and participating companies say. Details of the system were announced Wednesday during a White House event dubbed “Making Health Technology Great Again.” The system would be maintained by the federal government through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, pulling health data kept by Big Tech companies like Amazon, Google and Apple as well as major health companies like hospital system Cleveland Clinic and insurer UnitedHealth Group. Patients will need to opt in to have their medical records and data shared, which CMS says will be kept secure. Once a patient is in the system, their information could be shared across apps or health systems that have joined the initiative. So, for example, the Apple Health app on your iPhone that tracks your daily step count or your sleep could access lab results from your doctor's office. Putting that information together, the Trump administration says, will offer a fuller picture of your health. Apps and AI technology could also help people make better choices at the grocery store or identify patterns in their day-to-day life that might be affecting their health, said U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. during Wednesday's White House event. “Now if you have your medical records, you can get personalized advice,"" Kennedy said. Currently, there's no unified database where a person's health data and medical records are kept. Each health system stores, shares and releases patients' records in different ways. That's a big reason a lot of systems still rely on fax machines, because it's a guaranteed way to share records between offices and hospitals. Faxing is also a secure way to send information that complies with federal privacy laws. Some health networks also have their own apps, electronic systems or websites that allow patients to look up their records online or share information with other providers. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services says that 60 companies have signed on to work with the system and that they have pledged to “deliver results to the American people in the first quarter of 2026.” The Trump administration, however, made a similar proposal back in 2018 that never fully came to fruition. Patient advocates and ethicists say many may worry about how their health information — something Americans have long carefully guarded — could be used in ways that they don’t want or expect. “There are enormous ethical and legal concerns,” said Lawrence Gostin, a Georgetown University law professor who specializes in public health. “Patients across America should be very worried that their medical records are going to be used in ways that harm them and their families.” Also, digital privacy advocates say they are skeptical that patients will be able to count on their data being stored securely. “This scheme is an open door for the further use and monetization of sensitive and personal health information,” said Jeffrey Chester at the Center for Digital Democracy.","Once a patient is in the system, their information could be shared across apps or health systems that have joined the initiative.","Details of the system were announced Wednesday during a White House event dubbed “Making Health Technology Great Again.” The system would be maintained by the federal government through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, pulling health data kept by Big Tech companies like Amazon, Google and Apple as well as major health companies like hospital system Cleveland Clinic and insurer UnitedHealth Group.",Patient advocates and ethicists say many may worry about how their health information — something Americans have long carefully guarded — could be used in ways that they don’t want or expect.,"The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services says that 60 companies have signed on to work with the system and that they have pledged to “deliver results to the American people in the first quarter of 2026.” The Trump administration, however, made a similar proposal back in 2018 that never fully came to fruition.",neutral,0.523654580116272
Bessent says new Trump child savings accounts are 'back door for privatizing Social Security',https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/bessent-says-child-savings-accounts-in-trump-law-are-a-back-door-for-privatizing-social-security-2025-07-30/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Wednesday that the Trump administration was committed to protecting Social Security hours after he said in an interview that a new children's savings program President Donald Trump signed into law “is a back door for privatizing Social Security.” Bessent said Wednesday evening that the accounts created under Trump’s tax break-and-spending cut law “will supplement the sanctity of Social Security’s guaranteed payments.” “This is not an either-or question: our Administration is committed to protecting Social Security and to making sure seniors have more money,” Bessent said in a post on X. Bessent's remarks about privatizing Social Security, which he made at a forum hosted by Breitbart News, were striking after Trump’s repeated promises on the campaign trail and in office that he would not touch Social Security. It also reignited an issue that has dogged Republicans for years. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Democrats quickly seized on the comment as a sign the GOP wants to revive a dormant but unpopular push to privatize the long-running retirement program. “A stunning admission,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said in a Senate speech. “Bessent actually slipped, told the truth: Donald Trump and government want to privatize Social Security.” The idea of privatizing Social Security has been raised by Republicans before, but quickly abandoned. Millions of Americans have come to rely on the certainty of the federal program in which they pay into the system during their working years and then receive guaranteed monthly checks in their older age. Privatization proposals would shift the responsibility for the retirement savings system away from the government and onto Americans themselves. Through personal savings accounts, people would need to manage their own funds, which may or may not be enough to live on as they age. Under the GOP’s “big, beautiful bill,” as the law is called, Republicans launched a new children’s savings program, Trump Accounts, which can be created for babies born in the U.S. and come with a potential $1,000 deposit from the Treasury. Much like an individual retirement account, the Trump Accounts can grow over time, with a post-tax contribution limit of $5,000 a year, and are expected to be treated similarly to the rules for an IRA, and can eventually be tapped for distribution in adulthood. But Bessent on Wednesday allowed for another rationale for the accounts, suggesting they could eventually be the way Americans save for retirement. “In a way, it is a back door for privatizing Social Security,” Bessent said while speaking about the program. The Treasury Department later issued a statement that said, “Trump Accounts are an additive government program that work in conjunction with Social Security to broaden and increase the savings and wealth of Americans. Social Security is a critical safety net for Americans and always will be.” Ever since the George W. Bush administration considered proposals to privatize Social Security more than 20 years ago, Republicans have publicly moved away from talking about the issue that proved politically unpopular and was swiftly abandoned. In the run-up to the 2006 midterms, Democrats capitalized on GOP plans to privatize Social Security, warning it would decimate the program that millions of Americans have come to rely on in older age. They won back control of both the House and the Senate in Congress. The Democrats warned Wednesday that Bessent's comments showed that Republicans want to shift the government-run program to a private one and are again trying to dismantle the retirement program that millions of Americans depend on. “Donald Trump’s Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent just said the quiet part out loud: The administration is scheming to privatize Social Security,” Tim Hogan, a spokesperson for the Democratic National Committee, said in a statement. “It wasn’t enough to kick millions of people off their health care and take food away from hungry kids. Trump is now coming after American seniors with a ‘backdoor’ scam to take away the benefits they earned,” Hogan said. The Social Security program has faced dire financial projections for decades, but changes have long been politically unpopular. Social Security’s trust funds, which cover old age and disability recipients, will be unable to pay full benefits beginning in 2034, according to the most recent report from the program’s trustees. Those officials have said those findings underline the urgency of making changes to programs. Trump, attuned to Social Security's popularity, has repeatedly said he would protect it. Throughout his 2024 presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly said he would “always protect Social Security” and said his Democratic opponents, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, would destroy the program. During the 2024 primary, he accused other Republicans who have expressed support for raising the age for Social Security of being threats to the program. Trump said in an interview with NBC’s “Meet the Press” in December after he won the presidential election that “we’re not touching Social Security, other than we might make it more efficient.” His White House this year said Trump “will always protect Social Security.” Social Security Administration Commissioner Frank Bisignano, a Wall Street veteran, was asked at his confirmation hearing in March about whether Social Security should be privatized. He said he’d “never heard a word of it” and “never thought about it.” ___","WASHINGTON (AP) — Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Wednesday that the Trump administration was committed to protecting Social Security hours after he said in an interview that a new children's savings program President Donald Trump signed into law “is a back door for privatizing Social Security.” Bessent said Wednesday evening that the accounts created under Trump’s tax break-and-spending cut law “will supplement the sanctity of Social Security’s guaranteed payments.” “This is not an either-or question: our Administration is committed to protecting Social Security and to making sure seniors have more money,” Bessent said in a post on X.

Trump signs order to justify 50% tariffs on Brazil,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/trump-signs-order-to-justify-50-tariffs-on-brazil-2025-07-30/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump signed an executive order Wednesday to impose his threatened 50% tariffs on Brazil, setting a legal rationale that Brazil’s policies and criminal prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro constitute an economic emergency under a 1977 law. Trump had threatened the tariffs July 9 in a letter to President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. But the legal basis of that threat was an earlier executive order premised on trade imbalances being a threat to the U.S. economy. But America ran a $6.8 billion trade surplus last year with Brazil, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. A statement by the White House said Brazil’s judiciary had tried to coerce social media companies and block their users, though it did not name the companies involved, X and Rumble. Trump appears to identify with Bolsonaro, who attempted to overturn the results of his 2022 loss to Lula. Similarly, Trump was indicted in 2023 for his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Lula left an event about animal rights early on Wednesday after Trump's move, saying he needed to defend “the sovereignty of the Brazilian people in light of the measures announced by the President of the United States.” The order would apply an additional 40% tariff on the baseline 10% tariff already being levied by Trump. But not all goods imported from Brazil would face the 40% tariff: Civil aircraft and parts, aluminum, tin, wood pulp, energy products and fertilizers are among the products being excluded. The order said the tariffs would go into effect seven days after its signing on Wednesday. Also Wednesday, Trump's Treasury Department announced sanctions on Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes over alleged suppression of freedom of expression and Bolsonaro's ongoing trial. De Moraes oversees the criminal case against Bolsonaro, who is accused of masterminding a plot to stay in power despite his 2022 defeat. On July 18, the State Department announced visa restrictions on Brazilian judicial officials, including de Moraes.","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump signed an executive order Wednesday to impose his threatened 50% tariffs on Brazil, setting a legal rationale that Brazil’s policies and criminal prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro constitute an economic emergency under a 1977 law.","Lula left an event about animal rights early on Wednesday after Trump's move, saying he needed to defend “the sovereignty of the Brazilian people in light of the measures announced by the President of the United States.” The order would apply an additional 40% tariff on the baseline 10% tariff already being levied by Trump.","De Moraes oversees the criminal case against Bolsonaro, who is accused of masterminding a plot to stay in power despite his 2022 defeat.","Lula left an event about animal rights early on Wednesday after Trump's move, saying he needed to defend “the sovereignty of the Brazilian people in light of the measures announced by the President of the United States.” The order would apply an additional 40% tariff on the baseline 10% tariff already being levied by Trump.",neutral,0.5581426024436951
Why Lyft’s Stock Volume Just Spiked—Is an EV Partnership Near?,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/why-lyfts-stock-volume-just-spiked-is-an-ev-partnership-near/,"Whenever sentiment changes for a stock, investors can typically spot the shift before the big move happens and a window of opportunity quickly closes. A subtle sign can be found in a stock’s trading volume, as any significant increase above the typical or average volume is usually one of the first signs of positioning before a big move comes about. Lyft Inc. NASDAQ: LYFT popped up as one of the stocks recently experiencing unusually high trading volume. Historically, Lyft’s average daily volume has sat near 12 million shares. But in late July 2025, Lyft traded as many as 107.5 million shares in one day, meaning that significant returns may be on the horizon. This could be why some investors have chosen to accumulate stock ahead of these bullish expectations being realized. Those who wait for confirmation will likely be too late. Of course, Lyft doesn’t lead its sector in performance. Uber Technologies Inc. NYSE: UBER, Lyft’s closest rival, currently trades around 88% of its 52-week high, placing it officially in “bull market” territory, with a high probability of reaching a higher ceiling. That advance is fueled in part by Uber’s recent strategic deal with electric vehicle (EV) maker Lucid Group Inc. NASDAQ: LCID, designed to integrate electric and autonomous vehicle capabilities into Uber’s platform. This positions Uber strongly in the emerging self-driving rideshare space. Speculation is growing that Lyft could land a deal with another up-and-coming EV maker or autonomous vehicle developer. If that happens, it would create a multi-year tailwind and expand not only market share but also the company's overall financial profile. While this potential outcome is still speculative, some market analysts have already considered it one of the most likely scenarios for Lyft stock. Institutional interest lends credibility to this thesis. In late July 2025, Allianz Asset Management initiated a $19.4 million position in Lyft, indicating that deep-pocketed institutions with rigorous research capabilities see upside on the stock. And retail investors are paying attention. In addition, the 33 analysts tracked by MarketBeat have assigned LYFT stock a consensus price target of $16.98, a potential upside of 22%. Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Nikhil Devnani is one of the latest to boost his price targets to $18 per share, up from $16 per share, a potential upside of 30% from where it currently trades. These forecasts support the idea that the markets are betting on a potential EV partnership in the future. Given that Lyft stock is trading at only 73% of its 52-week high, it has room to run. Flirting with old highs seems no longer just an idea but a potential outcome. If the high volume is indeed investor positioning ahead of a major partnership or breakthrough, it suggests the opportunity for gains may be front-loaded. Waiting for official announcements or confirmation could mean entering at elevated price levels or missing the move entirely. It is important to remember that while volume can precede news, it doesn’t guarantee it. With Lyft’s next earnings call just around the corner, investors may soon get the clarity they need on strategic developments, including any hints about partnerships or growth initiatives. But for those ready to act, Lyft’s dramatic volume spike may signal a watershed moment if they take action before the window of opportunity closes.

"Is AI causing tech worker layoffs? That's what CEOs suggest, but the reality is complicated",https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/is-ai-causing-tech-worker-layoffs-thats-what-ceos-suggest-but-the-reality-is-complicated-2025-07-30/,"If you read the typical 2025 mass layoff notice from a tech industry CEO, you might think that artificial intelligence cost workers their jobs. The reality is more complicated, with companies trying to signal to Wall Street that they're making themselves more efficient as they prepare for broader changes wrought by AI. A new report Wednesday from career website Indeed says tech job postings in July were down 36% from their early 2020 levels, with AI one but not the most obvious factor in stalling a rebound. ChatGPT’s debut in late 2022 also corresponded with the end of a pandemic-era hiring binge, making it hard to isolate AI's role in the hiring doldrums that followed. “We’re kind of in this period where the tech job market is weak, but other areas of the job market have also cooled at a similar pace,” said Brendon Bernard, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab. “Tech job postings have actually evolved pretty similarly to the rest of the economy, including relative to job postings where there really isn’t that much exposure to AI.” That nuance is not always clear from the last six months of tech layoff emails, which often include a nod to AI in addition to expressions of sympathy. When he announced mass layoffs earlier this year, Workday CEO Carl Eschenbach invited employees to consider the bigger picture: “Companies everywhere are reimagining how work gets done, and the increasing demand for AI has the potential to drive a new era of growth for Workday."" Autodesk CEO Andrew Anagnost explained that a need to shift resources to “accelerate investments” in AI was one of the reasons the company had to cut 1,350, or about 9%, of workers. The “Why We're Doing This” section of CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz's announcement of 5% job cuts said the cybersecurity company needed to double down on AI investments to “accelerate execution and efficiency.” “AI flattens our hiring curve, and helps us innovate from idea to product faster,” Kurtz wrote. It's not just U.S. companies. In India, tech giant Tata Consultancy Services recently characterized its 12,000 layoffs, or 2% of its workforce, as part of a shift to a “Future-Ready organization” that would be realigning its workforce and “deploying AI at scale for our clients and ourselves.” Even the Japanese parent company of Indeed and Glassdoor has cited an AI shift in its notice of 1,300 layoffs at the job search and workplace review sites. Microsoft, which is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter earnings Wednesday, has announced layoffs of about 15,000 workers this year even as its profits have soared. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told employees last week the layoffs were “weighing heavily” on him but also positioned them as an opportunity to reimagine the company's mission for an AI era. Promises of a leaner approach have been welcomed on Wall Street, especially from tech giants that are trying to justify huge amounts of capital spending to pay for the data centers, chips and other components required to power AI technology. “It’s this sort of double-edged sword restructuring that I think a lot of tech giants are encountering in this age of AI, where they have to find the right balance between maintaining an appropriate headcount, but also allowing artificial intelligence to come to the forefront,” said Bryan Hayes, a strategist at Zacks Investment Research. Google said last week it would raise its budget for capital expenditures by an additional $10 billion to $85 billion. Microsoft is expected to outline similar guidance soon. One thing is clear to Hayes: Microsoft's job cuts improve its profit margin outlook for the 2026 fiscal year that started in July. But what these broader tech industry layoffs mean for the employment prospects of tech workers can be harder to gauge. “Will AI replace some of these jobs? Absolutely,” said Hayes. “But it’s also going to create a lot of jobs. Employees that are able to leverage artificial intelligence and help the companies innovate, and create new products and services, are going to be the ones that are in high demand.” He pointed to Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, which is on a spree of offering lucrative packages to recruit elite AI scientists from competitors such as OpenAI. The reports published by Indeed on Wednesday show that AI specialists are faring better than standard software engineers, but even those jobs are not where they have been. “Machine-learning engineers — which is kind of the canonical AI job — those job postings are still noticeably above where they were pre-pandemic, though they’ve actually come down compared to their 2022 peak,” said Bernard, the Indeed economist. “They’ve also been impacted by the cyclical ups and downs of the sector.” Tech hiring has particularly plunged in AI hubs such as the San Francisco Bay Area, as well as Boston and Seattle, according to Indeed. But in looking more closely at which tech workers were least likely to get hired, Indeed found the deepest impact on entry-level jobs in the tech industry, with those with at least five years of experience faring better. The hiring declines were sharpest in entry-level tech industry jobs that involve marketing, administrative assistance and human resources, which all involve tasks that overlap with the strength of the latest generative AI tools that can help create documents and images. “The plunge in tech hiring started before the new AI age, but the shifting experience requirements is something that happened a bit more recently,” Bernard said. Microsoft, which is staking its future on AI in the workplace, has also had its own researchers look into the jobs most vulnerable to the current strengths of AI technology. At the top of the list are knowledge work jobs such as language interpreters or translators, as well as historians, passenger attendants, sales representatives, writers and customer service representatives, according to Microsoft's working paper. On the other end, leading in work more immune to AI changes were phlebotomists, or healthcare workers who draw blood, followed by nursing assistants, workers who remove hazardous materials, painters and embalmers.","In India, tech giant Tata Consultancy Services recently characterized its 12,000 layoffs, or 2% of its workforce, as part of a shift to a “Future-Ready organization” that would be realigning its workforce and “deploying AI at scale for our clients and ourselves.” Even the Japanese parent company of Indeed and Glassdoor has cited an AI shift in its notice of 1,300 layoffs at the job search and workplace review sites.","In India, tech giant Tata Consultancy Services recently characterized its 12,000 layoffs, or 2% of its workforce, as part of a shift to a “Future-Ready organization” that would be realigning its workforce and “deploying AI at scale for our clients and ourselves.” Even the Japanese parent company of Indeed and Glassdoor has cited an AI shift in its notice of 1,300 layoffs at the job search and workplace review sites.",One thing is clear to Hayes: Microsoft's job cuts improve its profit margin outlook for the 2026 fiscal year that started in July.,"“Tech job postings have actually evolved pretty similarly to the rest of the economy, including relative to job postings where there really isn’t that much exposure to AI.” That nuance is not always clear from the last six months of tech layoff emails, which often include a nod to AI in addition to expressions of sympathy.",neutral,0.5119948387145996

Hoffa legend endures 50 years after ex-Detroit union leader's disappearance,https://www.marketbeat.com/articles/hoffa-legend-endures-50-years-after-ex-detroit-union-leaders-disappearance-2025-07-30/,"DETROIT (AP) — It was September 2012 and dozens of residents looked on as police cordoned off the area around a shed just northeast of Detroit. Low whispers about what — or who — officers were searching for grew to more excited chatter when the name Jimmy Hoffa started floating around the normally quiet street. By that time, the name had become sort of mythical in and around Detroit. Wednesday marks 50 years since the iron-fisted former Teamsters union boss disappeared from a restaurant about 10 miles (16 kilometers) north of the city. Presumed dead long before being legally declared deceased in 1982, Hoffa's remains were not found beneath the concrete shed floor in Roseville in 2012. Nor were they uncovered eight years earlier, below floorboards in a Detroit house. Neither were they found in 2013 at a horse farm miles northwest of the city. In 2013, digging equipment found mostly dirt as authorities excavated a field in Oakland Township, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) north of Detroit. And no signs of Hoffa were found in 2022 during a search of land beneath the Pulaski Skyway in New Jersey. Hoffa, the son of a coal miner who died when he was 7, was born in Brazil, Indiana, but moved with his mother to Detroit while still a boy. He quit school at 14 and went to work, landing a job on a grocery warehouse loading dock. In 1932, Hoffa led a workers’ strike over poor labor conditions and unfair treatment of workers by the store, according to a post about him on the International Brotherhood of Teamsters website. He joined the union a year later and became a business agent for Local 299 in Detroit, the website said. Hoffa was elected the local's president in 1937 and would become a union organizer. He often found himself on the other end of the law. In 1937, he was convicted of assault and battery. In 1940, he pleaded no contest to charges of conspiring with unionized waste-paper companies to prevent non-union competitors from selling their products. Seven years later, he was arrested for attempted extortion. Each time, Hoffa only received fines. He continued to rise in the union's ranks. From 1957 to 1971, he served as the Teamsters general president. Hoffa had a history of associating with organized crime. In the late 1960s, he was convicted of fraud, conspiracy and jury tampering. He was sent to federal prison in 1967. President Richard Nixon commuted Hoffa's 13-year sentence in 1971. On July 30, 1975, Hoffa, now 62, was to meet reputed Detroit mob enforcer Anthony “Tony Jack” Giacalone and alleged New Jersey mob figure Anthony “Tony Pro” Provenzano at the Machus Red Fox restaurant in Oakland County’s Bloomfield Township. Hoffa called his wife, Josephine, about 2:15 p.m. from a pay phone to tell her no one showed up for the meeting. He has not been seen or heard from since despite scores of tips and multiple searches spanning several states. A grand jury later was convened in Detroit, but no one ever has been directly charged in Hoffa's disappearance or death. The FBI's Detroit office on Wednesday said the Hoffa case “remains one of the most well-known missing person investigations in FBI history.” “Regardless of the age of the case, the FBI Detroit Field Office remains committed to following all credible leads and is seeking information to assist in moving this case forward,” the agency said in a release. “The Hoffa investigation remains active, and our office continues to urge anyone with information to come forward.” Whomever is responsible went to great lengths to keep such information hidden, even after five decades. “I think it confirms in my mind ... somebody did a pretty good hit job on him,” Wayne State University educator Marick Masters said of Hoffa. Masters, professor emeritus at the university's Mike Ilitch School of Business in Detroit, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that Hoffa was considering getting back into Teamsters' leadership at the time of his disappearance. “He still, obviously, was very much passionately involved in the union and he wanted to find a way of moving forward in it,” Masters said. “Whatever the circumstances were, he was tragically prevented from doing that.” Hoffa was inducted into Labor’s International Hall of Fame in 1999, according to the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which refers to Hoffa on its website as “a worker's hero.” “He was viewed as a very passionate champion of the Teamsters,” Masters said. “On the other hand, he had problematic associations which besmirched the image of organized labor. He was a very controversial figure. He was capable of accomplishing things and also capable of having associations that raised questions about his integrity.”","By that time, the name had become sort of mythical in and around Detroit.","“Whatever the circumstances were, he was tragically prevented from doing that.” Hoffa was inducted into Labor’s International Hall of Fame in 1999, according to the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which refers to Hoffa on its website as “a worker's hero.” “He was viewed as a very passionate champion of the Teamsters,” Masters said.","“I think it confirms in my mind ... somebody did a pretty good hit job on him,” Wayne State University educator Marick Masters said of Hoffa.","The FBI's Detroit office on Wednesday said the Hoffa case “remains one of the most well-known missing person investigations in FBI history.” “Regardless of the age of the case, the FBI Detroit Field Office remains committed to following all credible leads and is seeking information to assist in moving this case forward,” the agency said in a release.",neutral,0.6700268387794495
